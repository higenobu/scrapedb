12/24/2021,"Some readers may remember, perhaps with a certain fondness, a song called Lily the Pink by the Scaffold (alias John Gorman, Mike McGear and myself) that was No 1 in the charts in 1968. The song was based on an old American folk song, and celebrated efficacious cures for mild ailments. Backing vocalists included some lesser-known figures from the world of music: Graham Nash (of the Hollies), Elton John (then Reg Dwight) and Tim Rice. Jack Bruce (of Cream) played bass guitar. It was the night before Christmas Eve, the year the song hit its peak. We were driving to Liverpool from London after recording it for an Eamonn Andrews show earlier that afternoon. The show was to be broadcast that night on the BBC. Time was very tight.  In those days, of course, you couldn’t press record or save on the remote, you couldn’t “watch again”. Once the programme was transmitted, that was it. If you missed it, you missed it for ever. And we were running late. Would we get home in time to watch ourselves on television? Unlikely, as we were still on the foggy outskirts of Nantwich. Suddenly, seeing a light on in one of the houses, we parked outside, rushed to the door and rang the bell. A man in his late 20s opened it. “Excuse me, do you have a telly?” asked John, politely elbowing his way into the living room. “Blimey!” the man said, “It’s the Scaffold! But you can’t be here – you’re there on the TV screen!” Sure enough, there we were, bounding on to the set at Lime Grove in our white suits. The man ran to the foot of the stairs. “Janet,” he called. “Guess who’s down here? The Scaffold!” From upstairs came a muffled scream. “Janet is your biggest fan – she’ll be down as soon as she’s changed and put on her makeup. I’m Dave by the way.” When the song ended, we took a bow in the living room, thanked Dave for his kindness, shouted our goodbyes upstairs and drove back home to Liverpool. Many years later, the white suits long since hung out to dry, I was approached after a poetry reading at a headteacher’s conference in Coventry by a lady who introduced herself as Janet. She told me that she had never believed her husband when he told her about our flying visit. “Was it true?” she asked. “Oh, yes,” I said. Janet raised an eyebrow and came over all headmistressy. “Then why didn’t you wait a few minutes, knowing that I wanted to meet you?” “We wanted to, but we had to be back in Liverpool before it closed for the night.” “It doesn’t matter,” she said. “At first I was tempted to bin all your records. Then, remembering it was Christmas – a time for giving and forgiving – I forgave you.” As I walked away, suitably reprimanded, I remembered more clearly how John, Mike and I felt as we drove home that night. Thrilled at seeing ourselves on telly, of course, but also guilty about not saying hello to our biggest fan. We also vowed that next time, we would ask the BBC to book us into a decent hotel for the night.

12/24/2021,"José Galvão does not look much like an elf. At 79, he has the weather-burned face and strong labourer’s hands of a man born in the mountains of central Portugal. Yet, for months he’s been beavering away behind the scenes to bring to life what must be one of the world’s friendliest and least showy Christmas celebrations.Every Christmas for the past eight years, the 170 or so residents of Cabeça in the Serra de Estrel mountain range transform their remote village into a rustic winter wonderland. The idea sprang from a competition run in 2013 by the local council, but has since taken on a life of its own, attracting a growing flow of visitors from across Portugal every year.Sitting just off the central plaza with some of his old-boy friends, José breaks off his chinwag to show me the three-inch folding knife in his pocket. “I’m no expert, but I do a bit of carving,” he chortles through a gap-toothed smile. “We’ve all got to muck in, certo? Cabeça is the Christmas Village after all.”  He is right on every count. Following his directions, I walk 100 metres or so down one of Cabeça’s narrow streets. Pop-up stores and market stalls line the route, which is busy with Portuguese day-trippers on the hunt for festive fun.I briefly stop at Loripão, a bakery from the next-door village, which has rented a villager’s front room for the fortnight’s celebrations. It’s a paradise of all things sweet and sugary, and its biggest seller by far is the bolo rei (king cake) – the rounded sugary bread topped with crystalised fruits that adorns every Portuguese sideboard at Christmas.Outside, decoration are strung between the square granite houses that characterise the local architecture. Everything is homemade, from the heart-shaped frames swaddled in ferns to the moss-covered stars studded with red berries. The only exception is the thin string of tiny, white Christmas lights that flows higgledy-piggledy between the houses, over the parish church, and around Café Dias – the only business in Cabeça that is open year-round.When the sun sets and the switch is flicked, the hilltop village – hemmed in as it is by steep forested slopes and blanketed in mid-winter darkness – lights up like the Star of Bethlehem.By the steps up to an ancient stone house, I find José’s yuletide contribution. It’s a loving attempt at creating the nativity family, with each figure, carved roughly from a thin tree trunk, about waist height. Pine-tree straight, they don’t have arms or legs, but each has a beatific countenance, graced with crossed eyes, wonky noses and winsome whittled smiles. Joseph even has a flowing, pine-leaf wig, while the baby Jesus is crowned with a nest of autumn leaves.Leaving the happy family, I head up the stairs into what an etched wooden sign describes as the Oficina de Natal (Christmas workshop). The single-room space is quite different from the tat-filled, depot-style emporiums that are the popular image of Santa’s workplace. There’s no shiny tinsel or tacky garlands, nor any plastic packaging or – praise the Lord and the Angel Gabriel – Christmas jingles or mawkish piped carols.Instead, as with the decorations that deck the village, the products for sale are resolutely artisanal. All are made from materials available in the hills around: painted pine cones and woollen baubles, wooden angels and bracken wreaths.It doesn’t take long for Portugal’s only “Christmas Village” to work its magic. Within minutes, the stresses of last-minute shopping and present wrapping dissipate. With an average age of about 68 and only three children under 15, Cabeça knows everything there is to know about taking things slow. I get into the groove with a gentle hike down into the valley. The steep, circular route takes me over terraces of crooked-armed olive trees and down to an ice-cold river. Abandoned stone settlements dot the path, a reminder of the centuries that this secluded community has lived through. The walk leaves me hungry. On Christmas Eve, millions of Portuguese sit down to an evening feast of bacalhau (salt cod) and boiled potatoes, followed by aletria (an egg-noodle dessert). But in landlocked Cabeça, hearty mountain fare dominates; caldo verde (vegetable broth), morcela (black pudding), alheira (a garlicky sausage stuffed with breadcrumbs), and pica pau (seasoned fried beef). I grab a rickety table in a pop-up restaurant in the basement of a two-storey house. Not so long ago, the low-roofed eatery would have been a home for cattle and sheep. The straw and manure are gone, but the stable-like atmosphere feels appropriate.Portugal’s Christmas Village may be steeped in back-to-basics nostalgia, but it’s far from staid. As well as soaking up the atmosphere (and the local aguardente liquors), visitors can enjoy a series of programmed events throughout the two-week season. Highlights include choral concerts, cooking classes and craft workshops.But Cabeça is not the only rural hideaway in Serra da Estrela that throws open its doors to visitors. The 42-strong Mountain Villages network arranges cultural celebrations throughout the year, such as a folk festival in Lapa dos Dinheiros in June, and summer sheep-blessings in Foldosa da Madalena.“It’s a way of not just keeping the traditions alive in these remote villages, but celebrating them,” says Célia Gonçalves, director of the Mountain Villages network and coordinator of the original competition that gave life to Portugal’s Christmas Village. “The pride the villagers get from showing off their culture like this is amazing.” With the night now long drawn in, it’s time to take my leave. Before going, I return one last time to pay my respects at Senhor Galvão’s nativity scene. The baby Messiah is still grinning gayly, his mountain home evidently glad tidings of great joy.The Christmas Village runs until 2 January. The trip was provided by the Center of Portugal Tourism Board (guided by Madomis Tours). Cabeça is a 20-minute taxi ride from Seia, which is well served by buses (Lisbon 4 hours, Porto 3.5 hours). Hotel Casa de Baixo, half an hour away in Alvoco das Várzeas, has doubles from €100 B&B Vilnius, LithuaniaLisbon’s Praça do Comércio, New York’s Rockefeller Center, Strasbourg’s Place Kléber and Rio de Janeiro’s Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon are all famed for their annual Christmas tree extravaganzas. But vying to outdo them is the Cathedral Square in Vilnius, which since 2015 has played host to increasingly discombobulating arboreal creations. Featuring giant snowflakes, this year’s stunning exhibit comprises a 27-metre, icicle-white cone topped by a huge shining star. Past themes have included fairytales, chess and the colour purple. Tallinn, EstoniaEvery neighbourhood has that one house that is fully decked out with twinkly lights and illuminated reindeer. Well, in Tallinn, make that every house. And park. And square. And street. Estonia’s walled capital defies the seasonal darkness by drenching its medieval centre with more than 300 light installations. Especially luminescent is Vabaduse Square, where light fountains shoot upwards into the winter sky.Bruges, BelgiumA favourite Christmas destination for decades, the canal-crossed Belgian city is pushing the boat out even more than usual this year with its city-wide Winter Glow festival. Take a stroll along the glittering “Light Trail” as it winds through the city’s cobbled, Christmas tree-lined streets. Take your pick from three Christmas markets: Market Square, Simon Steven Square and Zand Square.Colmar, FranceDon’t go to Disneyland Paris for a fairytale Christmas; the ancient Alsatian town of Colmar offers the real thing. With five separate markets, the town embraces the yuletide spirit with elfish gusto. As well as an 800 square-metre ice rink and an old-school carousel, check out the Christmas-themed wine cellars and gondola-riding children’s choir. Look out for the night watchman who walks the ramparts every night, as his predecessors have done since the middle ages.Prague, Czech RepublicMany Christmases ago, Good King Wenceslas looked out over Prague and – so the carol goes – saw the snow lying “deep and crisp and even”. Today, few places are more lively than the Czech capital at yuletide, with the streets thronging with partygoers, shoppers and tourists throughout December. The city’s famous Christmas market is officially postponed this year, but pop-up Christmas stalls still abound and fixed venues such as Havel’s Market are tinselled up to the nines. One tradition not to miss is the lighting of Charles Bridge’s gas lamps at dusk (around 4pm) each day.",Lifestyle/Travel,"Welcome to Cabeça, the Christmas capital of Portugal",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/dec/24/cabeca-the-christmas-village-of-portugal
12/24/2021,"The Republican assault on free and fair elections instigated by Donald Trump is gathering pace, with efforts to sabotage the normal workings of American democracy sweeping state legislatures across the US. A year that began with the violent insurrection at the US Capitol is ending with an unprecedented push to politicize, criminalize or in other ways subvert the nonpartisan administration of elections. A year-end report from pro-democracy groups identifies no fewer than 262 bills introduced in 41 states that hijack the election process.  Of those, 32 bills have become law in 17 states. The largest number of bills is concentrated in precisely those states that became the focus of Trump’s Stop the Steal campaign to block the peaceful transfer of power after he lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden. Arizona, where Trump supporters insisted on an “audit” to challenge Biden’s victory in the state, has introduced 20 subversion bills, and Georgia where Trump attempted to browbeat the top election official to find extra votes for him has introduced 15 bills. Texas, whose ultra-right Republican group has made the state the ground zero of voter suppression and election interference, has introduced as many as 59 bills. “We’re seeing an effort to hijack elections in this country, and ultimately, to take power away from the American people. If we don’t want politicians deciding our elections, we all need to start paying attention,” said Joanna Lydgate, CEO of the States United Democracy Center which is one of the three groups behind the report. Protect Democracy and Law Forward also participated. One of the key ways that Trump-inspired state lawmakers have tried to sabotage future elections is by changing the rules to give legislatures control over vote counts. In Pennsylvania, a bill passed in the wake of Trump’s defeat that sought to rewrite the state’s election law was vetoed by Democratic governor Tom Wolf. Now hard-right lawmakers are trying to bypass Wolf’s veto power by proposing a constitutional amendment that would give the legislature the power to overrule the state’s chief elections officer and create a permanent audit of election counts subject to its own will. In several states, nonpartisan election officials who for years have administered ballots impartially are being replaced by hyper-partisan conspiracy theorists and advocates of Trump’s false claims that the election was rigged. In Michigan, county Republican groups in eight of the 11 largest counties have systematically replaced professional administration officials with “stop the steal” extremists. Several secretaries of state, the top election officials responsible for presidential election counts, are being challenged by extreme Republicans who participated in trying to overturn the 2020 result. Trump has endorsed for the role Mark Finchem in Arizona, Jody Hice in Georgia and Kristina Karamo in Michigan who have all claimed falsely that Trump won and should now be in his second term in the White House. Jess Marsden, Counsel at Protect Democracy, said that the nationwide trend of state legislatures attempting to interfere with the work of nonpartisan election officials was gaining momentum. “It’s leading us down an anti-democratic path toward an election crisis,” she said.",News/US news, Report shows the extent of Republican efforts to sabotage democracy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/23/voter-suppression-election-interference-republicans
12/24/2021,"Expectation is growing that Donald Trump might face charges for trying to obstruct Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s election this year as a House panel collects more evidence into the 6 January attack on the Capitol, former prosecutors and other experts say. Speculation about possible charges against the former US president has been heightened by a recent rhetorical bombshell from Republican representative and 6 January panel vice-chair Liz Cheney suggesting the House panel is looking at whether Trump broke a law that bars obstruction of “official proceedings”.  Former prosecutors say if the panel finds new evidence about Trump’s role interfering with Congress’ job to certify Biden’s election, that could help buttress a potential case by the Department of Justice. In varying ways, Cheney’s comments have been echoed by two other members of the House select committee, Republican Adam Kinzinger and Democrat Jamie Raskin, spurring talk of how an obstruction statute could apply to Trump, which would entail the panel making a criminal referral of evidence for the justice department to investigate, say DoJ veterans. Cheney’s remarks raising the specter of criminal charges against Trump came twice earlier this month at hearings of the committee. Experts believe the charges could be well founded given Trump’s actions on 6 January, including incendiary remarks to a rally before the Capitol attack and failure to act for hours to stop the riot, say former justice department officials. “Based on what is already in the public domain, there is powerful evidence that numerous people, in and out of government, attempted to obstruct – and did obstruct, at least for a while – an official proceeding – i.e., the certification of the Presidential election,” said former DOJ inspector general and former prosecutor Michael Bromwich in a statement to the Guardian. “That is a crime.” Although a House panel referral of obstruction by Trump would not force DOJ to open a criminal case against him, it could help provide more evidence for one, and build pressure on the justice department to move forward, say former prosecutors. Attorneygeneral Merrick Garland has declined to say so far whether his department may be investigating Trump and his top allies already for their roles in the Capitol assault. The panel has amassed significant evidence, including more than 30,000 records and interviews with more than 300 people, among whom were some key White House staff. The evidence against Trump himself could include his actions at the “Stop the Steal” rally not far from the White House, where he urged backers to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell [or] you’re not going to have a country any more”. Trump then resisted multiple pleas for hours from Republicans and others to urge his violent supporters to stop the attack. Recent rulings by Trump-appointed district court judges have supported using the obstruction statute, which federal prosecutors have cited in about 200 cases involving rioters charged by DOJ for their roles in the Capitol assault that injured about 140 police officers and left five dead. Still, experts note that the House panel’s mission has been to assemble a comprehensive report of what took place on 6 January and work on legislation to avoid such assaults on democracy. They caution that any criminal referral to DOJ documenting Trump’s obstruction of Congress will take time and more evidence to help bolster a DOJ investigation. Some DOJ veterans say that any referral to DOJ by the House panel for a criminal case against Trump – and perhaps top allies such as ex chief of staff Mark Meadows, whom the House last week cited for criminal contempt for refusing to be deposed – might also include Trump’s aggressive pressuring of federal and state officials before 6 January to block Biden’s win with baseless charges of fraud. Bromwich stressed that “the evidence is steadily accumulating that would prove obstruction beyond a reasonable doubt. The ultimate question is who the defendants would be in such an obstruction case. Evidence is growing that, as a matter of law and fact, that could include Trump, Meadows and other members of Trump’s inner circle.” Cheney teed up the issue about Trump’s potential culpability first at a House panel hearing last week, when she urged that Meadows be held in contempt for refusing to be deposed, and then hit Trump with a rhetorical bombshell. “We know hours passed with no action by the president to defend the Congress of the United States from an assault while we were counting electoral votes,” Cheney said. “Did Donald Trump, through action or inaction, corruptly seek to obstruct or impede Congress’ official proceeding to count electoral votes?” Cheney’s comments about Trump were very precise, including language from the criminal obstruction statute, and she stated that her question is a “key’ one for the panel’s legislative tasks. Raskin too has told Politico that the issue of whether Trump broke the law by obstructing an official proceeding is “clearly one of the things on the mind of some of the members of the committee”. “The possibility of obstruction charges is legally valid,” said Paul Rosenzweig, a former DOJ prosecutor who worked on Ken Starr’s team during the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton, noting that two district judges appointed by Trump “have recently said that the statute covers the efforts on January 6 to stop the electoral count”. For instance, Judge Dabney Friedrich in a recent opinion rejected the claim by some defendants who were challenging the DOJ view that the 6 January meeting of Congress fit the legal definition of an “official proceeding”. Rosenzweig posited that given Trump’s various attempts before 6 January to undermine the election results, a broader conspiracy case may be another option for prosecutors to pursue. Should DOJ look at broader conspiracy charges, Trump’s persistent pressures on acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and his top deputy for help blocking Biden’s victory wouldprobably be relevant, say ex-prosecutors. On one call on 27 December 2020, Trump pressed Rosen and his deputy to falsely state the election “illegal” and “corrupt” despite the fact that the DOJ had not found any evidence of widespread voter fraud. Paul Pelletier, a former acting chief of the fraud section at DOJ, said that Cheney’s statements were “carefully crafted and obviously based upon evidence the committee had seen. Should Congress ultimately refer the case to DOJ for investigation and prosecution, the DOJ’s investigation would not be limited to a single obstruction charge, but would more likely investigate broader conspiracy charges potentially involving Trump and other key loyalists.” The panel has accelerated its pace recently by sending out dozens of subpoenas for documents and depositions, some to close Trump aides. Meadows has become a central focus of the inquiry, in part over tweets he received on and near the insurrection that are among approximately 9,000 documents he gave the panel, much to Trump’s chagrin. As Trump’s efforts to thwart the panel from moving forward have had limited success, he has relied on sending out splenetic email attacks, including one last month that read: “The Unselect Committee itself is Rigged, stacked with Never Trumpers, Republican enemies, and two disgraced RINOs, Cheney and Kinzinger, who couldn’t get elected ‘dog catcher’ in their districts.” Despite Trump’s angry attacks on the panel, some ex-prosecutors say that prosecuting Trump – if enough evidence is found to merit charges – is important for the health of American democracy. Former Georgia US attorney Michael J Moore told the Guardian: “I hate to think of a legal system that would allow the most powerful person in the country to go unchallenged when he has abdicated his highest priority, that being to keep our citizens safe. Trump’s conduct that day was not unlike a mob boss.”",News/US news,"Donald Trump could face charges for trying to obstruct certification of election, legal experts say ",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/24/donald-trump-charges-capitol-attack-obstruct-congress
12/24/2021,"The sprawling 419-bed Oscott Gardens in north Birmingham was once home to hundreds of first-year university students. From January, however, in a first-of-its-kind project for the city, the student halls will become temporary accommodation for homeless families as the council buckles under the strain of a national housing crisis. “We’re seeing around 300 families a month present to us as homeless, enough to fill a whole tower block,” said Sharon Thompson, Birmingham city council’s cabinet member for vulnerable children, families and homelessness. “Having been a councillor since 2014, I’ve never seen local communities hit in the way they are at the moment.”  About 3,800 households are currently in temporary housing across the city, and 580 of those are in a bed and breakfast or hotel, where families are often crammed into one room with no access to cooking or washing facilities. Oscott Gardens will house up to 300 families who will each be given their own self-contained flats with en suite bedrooms, and former student common rooms will be turned into support centres so families can easily access council services. “This will be more modern, more comfortable. No council wants to put people in a bed and breakfast, but there’s not enough housing stock. And when people come to us in crisis, they’re coming to us with their clothes in black bin-bags and two or three children, and we need to find them somewhere now,” Thompson said. With the eviction ban, brought in during the Covid pandemic, having ended in May and rent in the city expected to rise by 16% over the next five years, the council is bracing itself for the numbers to increase. “The profile of people that are coming forward as homeless is very different nowadays. We’re seeing more professionals who have been on furlough and found themselves in a pickle,” said Thompson “We always said, in housing terms, we wouldn’t see the real impact of the pandemic until towards the end of it – and that’s what is happening now.” Frustrations are erupting in the community, too. In November, the housing charity Shelter launched the Birmingham Fair Housing campaign, calling for more social housing and better rights for people in temporary accommodation. Clare Caudery joined the campaign after spending 18 months in temporary council accommodation with her two young children during lockdown. “In that 18 months, we moved 12 times. Once we had to leave a Travelodge we were staying in with a day’s notice. It was really distressing,” said Caudery, who had lived in a privately rented flat for six years but was forced to leave when it was declared unfit to live in. Moving around the city meant the family were often forced to make long journeys involving multiple buses to get to school and had to rely on takeaway food that left one of her children ill. “I did learn how to do pasta in a Thermos flask, just letting it sit there in the water,” she said. “But you can’t even sneak a microwave or toaster in because the electrics can’t handle it or you set the smoke alarms off and everyone ends up out in the freezing cold. Some families did it because they were so desperate.” She said being housed somewhere like Oscott Gardens would have been significantly better, but she has some doubts over the long-term impact of the project. “It sounds like a much better alternative to B&Bs, but a lot of it depends how it’s managed and I don’t think it’s going to be enough unless we actually start building social housing again. Before you know it, it’s going to be 600, 800. It’s investing money in the plaster, not in preventing the wound.” Research has estimated that Birmingham needs 4,000 new homes a year over the next decade to meet demand, but average supply has been approximately 900 homes a year since 2010. The number of people on the waiting list for social housing has soared to 19,500, up from about 14,000 last year. The council’s housing stock has fallen from more than 120,000 units in the 1980s to about 60,000, largely as a result of schemes such as right to buy. In 2019, the city council launched a 10-year housing plan committing to building 2,708 new homes but admits the scale of the problem is huge. “Birmingham city council is the biggest council house builder in the country, and we still can’t meet our demand,” said Thompson. “We have built on as much council land as we can. It’s estimated by 2031 we’ll have an additional 158,000 people living in the city, which equates to nearly 90,000 properties. Now we’re starting to look outside the city boundary.” The council’s main priority now is trying to prevent homelessness in the first place. “We can very quickly fill Oscott Gardens and anything else we get, and we’re back to square one and we’re filling up hotels again,” said Stephen Philpott, head of housing solutions at the council, adding they’re recruiting 123 staff to try to reach families before they hit a crisis. “When we get an opportunity to do prevention, 75% of the time we’re successful in it.” For campaigners such as Caudery, the main focus is ensuring families don’t have to experience what she went through. “No child should be stuck in temporary accommodation in a country that is so wealthy. I just find it appalling. Our leaders should be ashamed that this is going on,” she said. “My own child, she was nine and able to recognise that the way we’d been treated was inhumane. “It feels like wherever you turn, you’re just smashing your head against brick walls. Sometimes it’s very compassionate people but all they can say is there’s a housing crisis, there’s no houses, there’s nothing they can actually do. We need a huge overhaul of housing in this country.”",News/UK news,Birmingham to convert ex-university halls in struggle with homelessness,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/24/birmingham-to-convert-ex-university-halls-in-struggle-with-homelessness
12/24/2021,"Plans for a new underground coalmine in Wales could be approved imminently despite pledges made at the Cop26 climate conference to move away from the dirtiest fossil fuel. The Coal Authority is imminently expected to decide whether the conditions have been met to allow work to begin at an old deep-shaft site at Aberpergwm in south Wales.  A row has emerged since Cop26 between ministers at Whitehall and the devolved Welsh administration over which government office holds responsibility for reviewing and making a final decision on the impending permit. In 2016, Energybuild Ltd was given a conditional mining licence that would allow the firm to extract up to 40m tonnes of anthracite over the coming two decades. But the company says that if the Aberpergwm project were to go ahead, it would seek to dig up only about 7.3m tonnes at a rate of about 350,000 tonnes a year. Anthracite (sometimes referred to as “hard coal”) has the highest carbon content of all coal varieties, although it has relatively low levels of sulphur and produces less particulate matter than other forms of coal. It can be used for a number of industrial purposes, but is also burned as a domestic fuel. According to Wales’s deputy climate change minister, Lee Waters, the Aberpergwm scheme could emit 100m tonnes of CO2 over its lifetime, along with considerable quantities of methane. He says the date of the licence means that new devolved powers – which came into force in 2018 and have been used to block new opencast mining applications last year – do not apply to this case. Waters has written to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, in which the Coal Authority is housed, to request the licence be cancelled. “We want to keep this coal in the ground,” he told the Welsh parliament. “But the UK government, because of the powers in place, threaten to sit by and watch this coal being extracted in the face of our wishes.” The project would see the expansion of the only anthracite mine operating anywhere in the UK, with the country’s only other major ongoing coal scheme, the surface mine at Ffos-y-Fran, also located in south Wales. Aberpergwm may come to represent a serious unforeseen headache for Boris Johnson’s government, as the UK pledged to lead international coal phase-out efforts when hosting November’s UN climate summit. “There should be no question of extending coalmines anywhere in the UK,” said John Ashton, a former climate envoy. “It beggars belief that this should even be under consideration at Aberpergwm, with so much at stake after the Glasgow climate Cop for both Cardiff and Westminster. This has all the hallmarks of a decision that has not yet received the high-level attention it urgently needs.” More than 3,500 emails about the Aberpergwm project have been sent this week to the offices of Waters and Michael Gove at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Gove is also due to rule early next year on plans for a controversial new deep coalmine in west Cumbria. Energybuild says the Aberpergwm project would sustain 160 jobs and dozens more in the supply chain. It has promised to gradually move away from supplying steelworks at Port Talbot, where about half of the coal it produces currently goes. The UK government intends to decarbonise domestic steel production by 2035. Tata’s Port Talbot and British Steel’s Scunthorpe Steelworks are the country’s second and third biggest single-site emitters of carbon, and the global steel industry is estimated to produce 11% of the world’s total CO2 emissions. Energybuild aims to have a greater share of its coal destined for other end uses such as water filtration, which at present accounts for about 15% of its market. A spokesperson for the firm said: “We are the only producer of anthracite for filter media in Europe.” Daniel Therkelsen, from the Coal Action Network, said: “We hear EnergyBuild Ltd recycling the same greenwash of other coal operators, but the bottom line is the more coal we mine, the more we use – driving localised air pollution around mines and steelworks, and global climate change. “It’s vital that the Welsh and UK governments resolve which has the powers to stop this climate wrecking extension – and use those powers immediately, as this pending licence may be deconditionalised imminently.” A UK government spokesperson said: “The Coal Authority and Welsh ministers are continuing to discuss the matter but no decisions have been made yet on whether the mining project can progress.”",News/UK news,New Wales coalmine may soon be approved despite Cop26 pledges,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/24/new-wales-coalmine-may-soon-be-approved-despite-cop26-pledges
12/24/2021,"In the attic of a cottage in the woods near the Polish village of Narewka, a young Iraqi Kurd crouches, trembling with cold and fear. Through the skylight, the blue lights of police vans flash on the walls of his hiding place. Outside, dozens of border guards are searching for people like him in the snowstorm. Downstairs, the owner of the house sits in silence with his terrified wife and children. The young Kurd is one of thousands of asylum seekers who entered Poland across the border with Belarus, where countless others have become trapped on their way to Europe. The Polish family have offered him shelter. But if the Polish police find him, he risks being sent back across the frontier into the sub-zero forests of Belarus, while his protectors risk being charged for aiding illegal immigration.  As people fleeing conflict or starvation have become trapped on the Poland-Belarus border in the middle of a freezing winter, Polish families have been secretly hiding hundreds of desperate people in their homes. Fears of the knock at the door as border police launch a manhunt bring back terrible echoes of the second world war, when thousands of Polish Jews were given refuge by their neighbours during the Nazi occupation. “Let’s make one thing clear, this is far from being the Holocaust,” says a Polish woman who has sheltered a Syrian family in her home for five days. “At the same time … when you have six people hiding in your attic forced to stay in the dark to avoid being sent back, as a Pole you can’t help thinking of the similarities with that time.” Every day since early October, Jakub*, 38, from Narewka, has searched the forests near the border to find people in need of water, food and a safe place to sleep. With his dog, Jakub follows signs of the presence of people who attempted to cross the frontier: nappies, damp blankets, or makeshift huts built with tree branches. During the war one of his uncles, who died a few years ago, helped dozens of Jewish families in Warsaw avoid deportation. Now, 80 years later, Jakub has hidden and helped at least 200 people who risked being herded back over the border to Belarus. “I’ve never compared what I’m doing today to what my uncle did,” Jakub says. “I help these people because they need help. It’s that simple.” The European Union has accused Belarus of deliberately provoking a new refugee crisis by organising the movement of people from the Middle East to Minsk and promising them with safe passage to the EU, in reprisal for sanctions that Brussels has imposed on its regime. Poland, in turn, has been accused by human rights organisations of violently pushing back thousands of people across the border. People such as Jakub, seeing the desperate families huddled in the snow, have taken it on themselves to help. Often it is a race between local volunteers and police to find the border crossers first. In his room in a small home a few miles from Sokolka, Bartek, 14, has invented a device to locate people at risk of being sent back into Belarus. “I opened accounts to connect migrants’ phones,” he says. “I set up their accounts on Google and WhatsApp and linked their phones to one of my accounts. This way I can see where they have recently logged in and send help.” Bartek and his aunt, Ewa, aided a Syrian family whose oldest child was five. They had been pushed back to Belarus 17 times. “What is happening here is totally unacceptable,” says Ewa, 40, whose grandmother smuggled pork fat and potatoes into the Jewish Ghetto during the second world war. “My grandmother hid Jewish children in her house too,” she says. “The flap in the floor was covered with a bed on which my great-grandmother lay. I feel like I am carrying on my grandmother’s work.” Ewa has bought thermal cameras to locate people at night. “When you go to the forest, you don’t know what awaits you, if someone is behind you,” she says. “Next year when you go to the forest to pick mushrooms, you don’t know whether you will find mushrooms or dead bodies. Some people said they found bodies of refugees torn apart by animals. In the area where migrants are camping, sometimes you can smell an intense smell of decay.” At least 19 people have died since the beginning of the border standoff between Poland and Belarus. Most of them froze to death. Some of their bodies were buried in the Muslim graveyard in the village of Bohoniki, near Sokolka, in the heart of the forest that claimed their lives. As temperatures dip near freezing, Bartek, Jakub and Ewa belong to a network of Poles who are working desperately to prevent more deaths. “We’re doing something normal to help others,” says Ewa, “but they make you out to be a criminal.” Since Poland imposed a state of emergency, all help for the people in the woods is on the shoulders of local residents and activists. In recent weeks more and more aid workers and citizens have been stopped by police forces, who have searched at least three homes looking for migrants. “The situation seems to have escalated and officers became more violent towards aid workers,” says Witold Klaus, a professor at the University of Warsaw’s Centre for Migration Law Research. “This is part of intimidation and is probably calculated for its chilling effect – a discouragement to offer help to immigrants. Providing humanitarian assistance is not a crime. But this is the law in books and it doesn’t stop authorities from breaking it.” On 14 December a group of activists were stopped by military personnel in the forests near the village of Zabrody. They were forced to lie face down on the ground and searched. On 15 December Polish armed police forces raided one of the humanitarian aid hubs in the border region of Podlachia, seizing mobile phones and laptops. The Polish ministries of interior and defence did not comment when approached by the Guardian. During recent pro-migration protests in Michałów and Hajnówka, young activists met elderly people who had sheltered fugitives during the second world war. Jakub says: “They said that they had hidden Jews during the war and that they had something in common with us.” In 1939, Tatiana Honigwill, a young Polish Jew from Warsaw, was deported to the German concentration camp in Ravensbrück. After Russian liberation in 1945, Tatiana returned to Poland. She died a few years ago, survived by several granddaughters. One of them is Maria Przyszychowska, 43, a painter, who now lives near the border town of Hajnówka. She and her husband, Kamil Syller, 48, have started an unofficial network of local residents and activists who have placed green lights in their windows to show that their home is a temporary safe space for refugees. At first it was a symbolic gesture. Then, suddenly, the first people started to show up at their doors. The couple welcome them into their home and give them basic necessities. “We are trying to protect asylum seekers and now our activity has become a form of resistance,” says Kamil. “But we don’t want to be heroes. And it’s becoming really frustrating.” For weeks, Maria and Kamil’s home has been under surveillance. Border guards patrol the streets around their building. Green lights have also started to attract the guards, who hide in the forests and wait for people to come out and then push them back. Prohibiting an individual from the right to apply for asylum is an infringement of human rights. Despite individuals expressing their intention to apply for asylum, arrivals in Poland have been forced back in systematic mass expulsions. “Maybe someday, when this is over, we’ll be able to talk openly about what the police did to migrants and what we went through to help them,” says Jakub. “I don’t know when, but I’m sure that day will come. Until then, we’ll continue to work in the dark. In the end, we are what they called us: secret guerrillas.” (*Some names have been changed to protect people’s identities)",News/Global development,‘My grandmother hid Jewish children’: Poland’s underground refugee network,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/24/my-grandmother-hid-jewish-children-polands-underground-refugee-network
12/24/2021,"Australian man Carl Stanojevic might be the world’s most considerate neighbour after he was asked to “take the bins out” and dutifully followed the request – to the letter. The practical joke began when the 54-year-old photographer from Mackay, in Queensland, received a late-night text message from his neighbour, Nick Doherty – who works remotely – asking if Stanojevic “would be able to take my bins out please”.  Stanojevic then joked about taking the bin out to local restaurants and bars. The next morning, after it was emptied and cleaned, Stanojevic decided to follow through on the banter. “I’ve known Nick for two years,” Stanojevic said on Friday. “We catch up for a beer when we can and have a chat and a few laughs. He’s a beautiful person. You’d do anything for him. He said take my bin out. If he had said put my bin out it would have been just a normal day in Mackay.” Grabbing his camera equipment and thinking like a tour guide, Stanojevic proceeded to take the number 6 wheelie bin on a big day out on Wednesday. To start with, they took a walk by the duck pond before taking care of some chores, stopping at a hardware store to pose with the staff, doing some shopping at the local supermarket and making a quick trip to the local tip. After this, they took in some sightseeing and a bit of self-care. “We went for a massage and then to the tattoo parlour to get a couple of extra 6s on the bin. A bit of a tattoo, then stopped at the pub for a coldie,” Stanojevic said on Friday. Along the way, the bin stopped for a selfie with a band of local cleaners, a surf lifeguard and a garbage truck driver. There was a quick trip through the drive-through at three separate restaurants and to make a call at a phone booth. “It wasn’t really talking to anyone,” Stanojevic said. “It was just talking trash.” Stanojevic said that though he and number 6 were on their best behaviour, at one point they were approached by two local council workers who were concerned they might have stumbled across a theft. Stanojevic said after a five-hour jaunt he reported back to Doherty to say he had completed his task. As proof, he sent through an album of photos he had taken to preserve the memories. Doherty was reportedly blown away by the favour, though Stanojevic says that since his bin has become a celebrity, Doherty is now afraid to put it out again for fear it may wander off on another adventure. “The whole idea was to put a smile on a few people’s faces, but I wasn’t expecting this to go around the world,” Stanojevic said of the media coverage his joke has attracted. Stanojevic, who often works for free documenting local events in the 80,000-person town almost 1,000km north of Brisbane, said Mackay had been hit hard by a loss of tourism during the coronavirus pandemic. “It’s good that it’s taken the focus off all this heartache with these lockdowns and Covid and that’s the idea of it,” he said. “We’ve definitely put a hell of a lot of smiles on people’s faces.”",News/Australia news,"Australian man asked his neighbour to take the bins out – so he did, literally",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/24/australian-man-asked-his-neighbour-to-take-the-bins-out-so-he-did-literally
