3/24/2022,"The U.S. Army's Special Forces, better known as Green Berets, have had a deep impact on Ukraine's fight to defend itself from a Russian invasion, despite not being directly involved in the conflict. ""Ukraine was taken very seriously by Special Forces,"" retired Green Beret Sergeant Major Martin Moore told Fox News Digital. After Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, a move that faced minimal resistance, the Ukrainian military began an effort to modernize its forces to prepare for possible further Russian incursions into the country. The U.S. military also quickly stepped in to help, with the Army's Green Berets, taking on a critical role in training Ukrainian forces. HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR, 96, IS KILLED IN UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""They immediately set upon a great effort to protect to Ukraine, to provide training,"" Moore said. ""There's nobody better at training than Green Berets. These are people that can teach."" While elite military units such as the Navy SEAL teams garner widespread attention, the Army's Green Berets are fanned out across the world helping Army's prepare for wars similar to the one now being fought in Ukraine. This work is typically done quietly, something Moore said Green Berets prefer. ""They do something different,"" Moore said. ""They go where nobody else is and find out what is possible."" Moore said Green Berets are a ""force multiplier,"" improving the combat capability of the international forces they work with. He stressed that they are not about ""raids and ambushes,"" but about having an ""unparalleled understanding of the place"" they are operating. HOW MISCALCULATIONS AND MISPERCEPTIONS COULD LEAD TO US-RUSSIA CONFLICT Green Berets are required to learn a foreign language as part of their training and are constantly trained in the political, economic and cultural complexities of the regions in which they are assigned to operate. This unique skill set allows them to partner with foreign forces for training and at times to fight alongside them. Those skills have been put to use in Ukraine since 2014, with Green Berets and members of the Army's National Guard advising and training Ukrainian forces at Yavoriv Combat Training Center in western Ukraine. It's the same facility Russia attacked with rockets on March 13, killing 35. The Americans had already left, vacating the facility and moving troops deployed there to Germany in February. Part of the job Green Berets did at Yavoriv was to train their Ukrainian counterparts to set up militia units that could wage guerrilla warfare against an invading force. The Ukrainian military can now put those lessons to use, with the government actively encouraging its citizens to join the fight against Russian forces. But the work Green Berets are doing in Europe hasn't stopped, with forces still stationed in Europe helping prepare partner countries for the possibility of a Russian invasion further into Europe. Such a move would be a mistake for Russia, Moore told Fox News Digital, arguing that the invasion of Ukraine has already gone poorly in part because of U.S. assistance, and a further move into NATO territory would go even worse.

A Ukrainian journalist who was captured by Russians was released from captivity Monday after she recorded a video saying the Russians had ""saved her life."" Local Ukrainian publication Hromadske said on Tuesday that Viktoriia Roshchyna — a journalist for the media outlet who had been taken into Russian custody on March 15 — had been freed and was now on her way to Zaporizhzhia to meet her family.

Hromadske reported that said video was a condition of Roshchyna's release from detainment. The outlet said she plans to tell the truth about captivity in the ""near future."" Hromadske said last week that it learned on on March 16 that Roshchyna was taken into Russian custody. Witnesses told the outlet on that Roshchyna was ""probably"" detained by Russia's Federal Security Service. Roshchyna was reporting on the Russia-Ukraine war at the time of her capture.

3/24/2022,"A Chinese dissident has joined a large group of international volunteers from 56 countries fighting for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion.

Yi Qiwei, a 26-year-old “third-generation red” who comes from a line of communist elites, enlisted in the International Legion for the Defense of Ukraine, also known as the Ukrainian International Legion, on March 10.

He enlisted just days after arriving at a refugee camp in the Polish border town of Medyka on March 7, then left for Kyiv on March 14.

Yi, also known as Wu Dizhao, and nine of his friends were reportedly in the Netherlands when Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Yi and his friends decided to lend a helping hand by driving to Medyka and giving the refugees clothes, food and supplies.

“You could see that those people were very helpless,” Yi said. ""There was no place for the children to sleep, it was super cold. They had no food at all and they were very helpless. Most of them can’t speak English or Polish. Many children are the same age as my daughter, which makes me sad. We provide them with food and water as much as possible.”

Yi, a U.S. national born in China, also assisted some of the refugees financially. He reportedly helped them stay in hotels since Poland does not accept their Ukrainian currency and cards.

A descendant of a Manchu royal bannerman, Yi was reportedly born to be a successor to his maternal grandfather, who was a high-ranking official in the Chinese Community Party (CCP). He was dubbed by Chinese media as “China’s most talented young writer” after publishing his first novel, “Redemption,” in 2011 when he was just 14 years old.

Yi became a vocal dissident of the CCP following the death of his father, a former state-run banking executive, in 2016. Yi claimed that his father was jailed during President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on corruption.

The volunteer fighter believes that Chinese propaganda supporting Russia promotes the idea that “national interests are above everything else.”

“If this happened to them, they would not say such things,” Yi said, referring to Chinese who support Russia. “There is no so-called ‘national interest.’ What the people want is very simple — to live in peace and stability.”

“The people can only develop the country’s economy if they are alive,” he added. “If you talk about those slogans with disregard of people’s lives, who would still follow you?”

The Ukrainian International Legion consists of foreign volunteers coming from more than 52 different countries, including Japan, Canada, the United States and countries from the United Kingdom and the European Union. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine estimated that there are over 20,000 volunteers in the military branch.

Around 180 foreign soldiers were reportedly killed during missile attacks on Ukrainian training centers in the village of Starichi and at the Yavorovsky military training ground on March 13, according to Russian Defense Ministry representative Major General Igor Konashenkov.

“At these facilities, the Kyiv regime deployed: A point for the training and combat coordination of foreign mercenaries before being sent to the areas of hostilities against Russian military personnel, as well as a storage base for weapons and military equipment coming from foreign countries,” Konashenkov said.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed gratitude to Japan for supporting the Eastern European country. He also urged Tokyo to apply “more pressure on Russia to help restore peace” during a video address to the National Diet on Wednesday. Enjoy this content? Read more from NextShark!
