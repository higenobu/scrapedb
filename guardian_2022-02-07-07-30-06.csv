2/7/2022,"The longer the game went on, the less likely it seemed that Senegal could triumph. Egypt are the masters of game-management, the kings of the shootout and Senegal, entangled in their own neuroses about having never won the tournament, seemed never quite to regain their belief after Sadio Mané missed an early penalty. But somehow, despite all the spoiling of Egypt and almost despite themselves, it was Senegal who lifted the Cup of Nations. This was a terrible final to end what has been a largely terrible tournament, won ultimately as Mané converted in the shootout after Édouard Mendy had saved from Mohana Lasheen.  There are rarely goals in Cup of Nations finals: just 10 in the last 10, four of which have gone the distance to penalties after 0-0 draws. And there are rarely goals in games involving Senegal or Egypt. Senegal had negotiated their way to this stage scoring nine goals and conceding just two; of those 11 goals, only one had come in the first half. Egypt had scored four and conceded two in six games and only three of those had come in the first half. So it was a major surprise when Saliou Ciss, Senegal’s marauding left-back, was scythed down in the area after three minutes, and perhaps less of a surprise when Mané’s penalty was well saved by Abou Gabal. Mohamed Salah had spoken to the Zamalek goalkeeper before his Liverpool teammate took it; Mané reacted by pointing where he was going to aim, before smashing his kick central. He had only recently returned to penalty duty after missing the vital kick against Cameroon in the 2017 quarter-final and then against Kenya and Uganda in 2019. Although he did score against Zimbabwe in the group stage, maybe celebrity shouldn’t determine who takes the spot-kicks. Abou Gabal is only a second-choice goalkeeper for Egypt, behind Mohamed El Shenawy, but, if you can leave aside his gamesmanship (and that is a big if, given his shameful playacting), he has had a superb tournament, saving five penalties, including shootouts. He also made a brave second-half block at the feet of Idrissa Gueye. Senegal, as Cameroon had in the semi-final, occasionally threatened to get in behind the Egyptian full-backs, but when they did, the crossing and the decision-making was too often poor. And like Cameroon, they soon found themselves frustrated by Egypt’s spoiling, the feigning of injury, the long debates after every decision. Egypt complained after the semi-final that all three of their knockout games had gone to extra-time, but in truth the ball is in play so little in their games that that is probably little different to an average side playing three games that are over in normal time. This is anti-football in its truest sense: it is not that they defend, it is that they actively try to prevent any football being played. Even with their coach, Carlos Queiroz, and his assistant, Roger De Sá, banned, the sustained moaning from the technical area continued. There was a second surge at the beginning of the second half but soon it too petered out. Senegal had played its best football in the final half hour of the quarter-final and semi-final, after Ismaila Sarr was introduced from the bench. Here, he was deemed fit enough to start and not only was he far less effective, but Senegal lost that potency in the final quarter of normal time. Senegal had the backing of swathes of noisy and passionate fans – and that was just in the press box, which was dominated by journalists in their blue Presse Senegal polo-shirts. But in the stands, too, Senegal fans predominated. There is a large Senegalese community in Cameroon, and there had been crowds around the Senegalese embassy in Yaoundé earlier in the day looking for tickets. Three planeloads of Egyptians, meanwhile, had flown in, ensuring at least something of an atmosphere. The attendance, though, was only around 35,000 – an indication of one of the major problems the tournament has had. The Africa Women’s Cup of Nations and the Africa Championship of Nations (for domestic-based players) have shown what an appetite there is for football in Cameroon, and the tournament was followed avidly on television and on radio – which certainly hasn’t always been the case at recent Cups of Nations. But Covid protocols dissuaded fans early in the tournament and, when they were relaxed, there was the tragedy at Olembé 13 days before the final as a crush caused the death of eight people. Concerns about a repeat, and the possibility of heavy-handed policing in reaction, led many to stay away for both the semi-final and the final.",Sport/Football,Mané scores decisive penalty as Senegal beat Egypt to win Africa Cup of Nations,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/senegal-egypt-africa-cup-of-nations-final-match-report
2/7/2022,"Eddie Jones’s decision to take Marcus Smith off at a crucial juncture in England’s Calcutta Cup defeat by Scotland was premeditated and a missed opportunity for the fly-half, according to his Harlequins coach, Tabai Matson. England were 17-10 ahead at Murrayfield – with Smith scoring all of their points – when Jones replaced him and introduced George Ford in the 63rd minute. Scotland proceeded to mount a dramatic comeback with Ford’s main contribution a disappointing touch-finder as Jones’s side sought to snatch victory in the closing minutes.  When asked about the substitution, Jones brushed off suggestions it was a costly decision, insisting, “It’s a 23-man squad and we felt George could do a job” – despite the fact that Smith had scored England’s only try and was on target with four penalties during his time on the field. Numerous former players questioned the decision and, when Matson was asked about Smith’s showing at Murrayfield before Harlequins’ defeat by Sale on Sunday, he told BT Sport: “I think when he went off it must have been premeditated because he was going really well. His opportunity to close out the game would have been great for him but it must have been premeditated.” Smith is, at least, expected to keep hold of the No 10 jersey against Italy on Sunday with Jones saying he will stick by his rookies as England seek to get their Six Nations campaign back on track. Tom Curry is also likely to retain the captaincy with a defiant Jones adamant that his players need to be put “back into the fire” after England succumbed to defeat on the opening weekend of the championship for the third year in a row. Italy’s defeat by France on Sunday was their 33rd in a row and the trip to Rome offers Jones the chance to freshen up his side. The England head coach revealed that Courtney Lawes, who has been sidelined since last month with a head injury, has an outside chance of being fit to face Italy but Curry is expected to continue as captain if he does not return. Manu Tuilagi made an eye‑catching 29-minute cameo in Sale’s 36-14 victory at the Stoop, so he, too, could come into contention to face Italy. The side that faced Scotland was the most inexperienced Jones has fielded in the Six Nations and, while England are now playing catchup in the championship, he intends to avoid making wholesale changes. “We’ve got a young team here that will learn a lesson from that,” Jones said. “I was really impressed by how in the first half it didn’t look like we were playing at Murrayfield – because we took it to them. So they didn’t have any of the fear of the crowd or the hostile reception you get. “It’s a tough lesson but we will learn from it, very quickly. They need to get put back in the fire but what I want to see is that enthusiasm to tackle the game. It’s only a good lesson if you learn from it. And the only way you learn from it is to be tested again. We’ll need to pick the best 23 to play against Italy. Courtney at this stage has an outside chance of playing against Italy. He is progressing well.” England’s defeat hinged on the penalty try awarded to Scotland when Luke Cowan-Dickie was shown a yellow card for deliberately slapping Finn Russell’s crossfield kick to Darcy Graham out of play. England led 17-10 at the time but another Russell penalty put Scotland 20-17 to the good and, while Jones’s side pressed for a response with a series of powerful scrums within kicking range, the referee, Ben O’Keeffe, opted against awarding a penalty. Jones has history with O’Keeffe, having been reprimanded for comments made after his side’s victory against Wales in 2020. Jones joked he would make a video similar to that which landed South Africa’s Rassie Erasmus in hot water last year but later said: “There is a good feedback system but ultimately we play in a game where there is a lot of judgment and the referee has got to make a judgment on the field quickly. And I am not going to criticise his decisions.”",Sport/Sport,Marcus Smith’s club coach questions substitution in England defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/marcus-smiths-club-coach-questions-substitution-in-england-defeat
2/7/2022,"Just 15.5% of the world’s coastal regions remain ecologically intact, according to new research that calls for urgent conservation measures to protect what remains and restore sites that are degraded. The study, led by researchers at the University of Queensland, used satellite data to examine the extent to which human activities have encroached on coastlines around the globe.  It found that up to 2013 – the latest year for which the data was available – few intact coastlines remained, with even remote areas such as the Kimberley region of Western Australia affected by fishing and mining. The research, published in the scientific journal Conservation Biology, builds on previous work that examined human activities within terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The small areas of coast that remain undamaged by pressures such as fishing, agriculture, urban development, mining and roads were mostly in Canada, followed by Russia, Greenland, Chile, Australia and the United States. Very few intact areas and often high levels of degradation were found in island nations, much of Europe, and countries including Vietnam, India and Singapore. Coastal regions containing seagrasses, savannah and coral reefs had the highest levels of human pressure. Brooke Williams, the study’s lead author and a conservation ecologist at the University of Queensland, said because most of the world’s population live in coastal regions, the pressures on those ecosystems could take many forms and occurred both on land and at sea. “Our paper really advocates for coastal region restoration quite urgently,” she said. “That such a low proportion is at the higher spectrum of the intactness scale is alarming. It’s not good news.” The situation certainly would not have improved since 2013, she said. The coastal analysis was compiled by using two datasets called the human footprint (which examined land-based ecosystems) and the cumulative human pressure index (which examined pressures in marine environments). Pressures were then mapped out to 50km on either side of the shoreline. Williams said areas that were still largely intact were often more remote and thus more difficult to access. In Australia, the Great Australian Bight remained relatively untouched, but Williams noted it had faced development threats in recent years. Co-author James Watson, of the University of Queensland, said remoteness didn’t guarantee coastlines would remain intact, pointing to mining and particularly fishing as industries causing environmental decline in those places. He said he had expected Madagascar, Namibia and northern Australia would all retain large areas of intact coastline, but it had not proved to be consistently the case. “It shocks me how pervasive fishing is. It’s just everywhere. You can’t avoid it,” he said. “These remote places around the world, you’re seeing fishing impacts.” The researchers argue that protecting the world’s coastlines will require a range of measures, including legislation to protect undamaged regions and restoration work to improve places that have been degraded. “You’ve got to increase those areas that are safeguarded,” Watson said. “And in places that are heavily degraded we’ve got to have a much bigger restoration agenda not just for species but for water, for carbon, all of those things.”",News/Environment,"Barely 15% of the world’s coastal regions remain ecologically intact, study says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/04/barely-15-of-the-worlds-coastal-regions-remain-ecologically-intact-study-says
2/7/2022,"Ihave dedicated my entire existence to eliminating uncertainty, stress and anxiety in all their possible forms. So there is nothing more compulsively watchable to me than someone not only rushing to embrace those things at every turn but actively creating them – pumping their life so full of exhilarations and potential disasters that it threatens to explode at the lightest touch. If you are of the same persuasion, settle back – or rather, sit on the edge of your seat and prepare to fall off well before the closing credits – and enjoy the masterful portrait of such a thrill-seeker in the BBC’s rather wonderful Chloe (BBC One). It is a fierce, fresh sort-of-murder-mystery that is as keenly scripted as it is paced, and whose many threads are held firmly together by an outstanding performance from Erin Doherty.  First (properly) seen as Princess Anne in The Crown, Doherty here plays Becky, a quiet twentysomething living with a mother who has early onset dementia. When not at one of her succession of office temp jobs, she spends her time obsessively scrolling through the social media accounts of Chloe (Poppy Gilbert), another twentysomething, who appears to be living a much more successful and glamorous life than her. It is soon revealed, however, that Becky has found a way of livening up her drab and (as her mother becomes more and more erratic and wounding) increasingly miserable life – namely, by faking several others instead. She is, in broad terms, a con artist. We watch in more or less grudging admiration as she parlays snippets of information, dates, names on invitations and overheard fragments of conversation as she gets first a toehold then a sturdy entrée into the art world. Her grift takes on a sudden focus, however, when the object of her obsession dies – apparently by suicide, preceded by a soulful quote put up on Chloe’s Instagram account, then confirmed by friends’ heartbroken posts beneath. Armed with a plausible backstory, a more suitable name (Sasha) and a designer coat she has lifted from a coat hook on the way out of the office, Becky gradually worms her way further into the scene. She covertly surveils the funeral, does some online digging and befriends Livia (Pippa Bennett-Warner), one of the bereaved posters and Chloe’s closest pal, to find out more about the non-curated version of Chloe’s life and the circumstances of her death. Another motivation is Becky’s slightly sociopathic instinct for meeting any emotional or practical need presented to her. The kaleidoscope twists again when we realise that there is a buried connection between Chloe and Becky so great that Becky was, in fact, the last person Chloe called – twice – before she died. Add further complications via a one-night stand, Josh (played by Brandon Micheal Hall with a perfect combination of amused detachment spiked with just a little fear, as he realises that there may be much more to the woman he knows as “Helena” than he ever suspected), and you have an absolute feast of a show. Created, written and directed by Sex Education alumna Alice Seabright, it has much of that show’s brio and fleet charm, although the subject matter couldn’t be more different. The central intrigue builds and never gets forgotten, but the real tension comes from seeing how far Becky can go – how big a house she can build with purloined business cards, how many plates she can keep spinning, how far out she can go with this jazz riff of a life and still get herself back in. On top of that, it’s a drama that examines the always fascinating gulf between the haves and the have-nots, and the increasingly common abyss running crossways to that – between the perceived figures (all filtered and posed shots presented for public consumption) who seem to be effortlessly winning at life and the ragged, very different realities behind them. Vitally for a drama about fake identities and shifting truths there is not one false note in it. That’s not to say it’s all massively likely (although before you decide quite how impossible Chloe’s events might be, do watch the upcoming fact-based Netflix drama about Anna Delvey, Inventing Anna, if you haven’t already mainlined everything you can about the most extraordinary scam artist of modern times). But you do understand what drives Becky, with all her gifts – whose useful expression is truncated by circumstance and crammed into a life that promises only to become smaller – to take the risks she takes and thrive on them. I hope she gets away with everything – and then joins Villanelle in Rome.",Arts/Television & radio,Chloe review – Erin Doherty is outstanding in this social media thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/06/chloe-review-erin-doherty-is-outstanding-in-this-social-media-thriller
