2/23/2022,"It Figures is Yahoo Life's body image series, delving into the journeys of influential and inspiring figures as they explore what body confidence, body neutrality and self-love mean to them. Mia Khalifa's public identity has long been associated with her body after she appeared in a Pornhub video in 2014 and became the most viewed actress on the site. After speaking out about the trauma that she experienced as a result and how she's working to move forward in her life, the 29-year-old is reclaiming her body and her relationship with it through her latest work with Playboy Centerfold. Khalifa shares her complicated history with Yahoo Life, explaining just how her body impacted her self-worth throughout her upbringing. It even made her feel more distant from her American classmates when she immigrated from Lebanon as a child and allowed her to seek attention by other means. ""I grew up very overweight and I didn’t start losing weight until I was like 18, 19, 20,"" she says. ""It made me insecure, it made me act hypersexual when the opportunity presented itself. Also, [I was] constantly craving validation."" She recalls seeking attention from men specifically as a means to feel good about herself at her lowest moments. ""I did not feel good about myself so I just let anyone have access to it,"" she recalls. ""I only thought that I was worthy of just existing when someone else desired me or seemingly desired me."" Still, she wouldn't come to understand these things until she had a life-altering encounter with a man who brought her into the realm of sex work. In her experience, she was made to feel completely out of control of not only her body but also the perception that people throughout the world had of her. ""It just sunk me into a depression and it sunk me into a spiral of shame,"" she says when reflecting on the vitriol she was faced with online and in real life after performing in a PornHub video while wearing a hijab. ""I still didn’t have the confidence to really take claim over my body."" In the years since, however, she's made an effort to do just that. Khalifa explains that her relationship with her body became better over time, noting that age made a huge difference in her experience. ""Just getting older and realizing what matters and what doesn't,"" she says. ""I love my imperfections. I feel like I’ve done the body modifications that I’ve wanted for a long time and thought hard on. I'm happy. I like the way I'm aging, I like the way I’m growing, I like the way I'm fluctuating."" She even came to realize that she could still share images of her body on social media and other platforms in a way that allows her to celebrate her figure and the new approach she has to body image, rather than feeling embarrassed by it. ""Maneuvering my way around the contradiction of feeling like I was powerless when I was in that time of my life versus doing it now in a completely different way really comes down to my confidence,"" she explains. ""The difference is now, it is all for me. The only thing that gets shown to the public or goes out into the public sphere is something that makes me feel empowered or sexy or confident or comfortable."" Now, her work with Playboy Centerfold, a creator-led digital platform dedicated to creative freedom, artistic expression and sex-positivity, is something that she looks to as beautiful and empowering rather than shameful.    A post shared by Centerfold (@playboycenterfold) ""I wouldn't say that I necessarily overcame my fear of putting my body out there. What I would say is the circumstances behind how it was happening became more in my control,"" Khalifa explains. ""My favorite part about what I'm doing now with Centerfold is that I plan everything, I decide what I wear, I decide what photos are taken, I decide everything, down to every little tiny detail. And that's what makes it fun and that’s what makes it empowering."" Most importantly, she can exercise caution when it comes to the message that young women are faced with on social media as Khalifa uses her voice and her imperfections to start an important conversation about body image alongside her display of relatively newfound body acceptance. ""Part of me worries about today's generation with the whole FaceTune era, all of the plastic surgery being pushed on them. But another part of me just also sees the positive side of that, which is more conversations around body positivity and acceptance. And [a] better relationship with food and yourself,"" she says. Ultimately, she wants people to learn from her past mistakes by accepting them as a part of her journey. ""I hope that the one thing that others learn from me is it is not a death sentence. You can do whatever you want, whatever you want,"" she says. ""As long as you ignore all of the voices telling you you can't, literally nothing is stopping you."" -Video produced by Olivia Schneider Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox?

2/23/2022,"Arnold Schwarzenegger said he's been mostly vegan for the past five years. The bodybuilding champ said he eats about 80% plant-based food, and it keeps his cholesterol low. He also enjoys an occasional treat like a steak, which experts say can keep a diet sustainable. Bodybuilding legend Arnold Schwarzenegger said he's been eating a mostly plant-based diet for the past five years, and it significantly lowered his cholesterol. Schwarzenegger said in a recent edition of his email newsletter that about 80% of what he eats is vegan. He said he makes an occasional exception for steak or Austrian wiener schnitzel — leaving room for treats in your diet can help avoid restriction and can help you stick to a diet long term, experts previously told Insider. The former seven-time Mr. Olympia has been outspoken about the benefits of a vegan diet for health, inspiring a generation of vegan bodybuilders to build muscle on plant-based diets. He said it's helped him feel ""healthier and younger overall,"" and helped reduce his levels LDL cholesterol, a type of cholesterol sometimes called ""bad"" cholesterol because its linked to higher risk of heart disease. ""My bad cholesterol number is so low that my doctor thought I might be a different person,"" Schwarzenegger said in the newsletter. Certain animal-based foods like fatty cuts of meat, processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, and dairy products like cheese are linked to higher cholesterol levels, evidence suggests. In contrast, veggies, especially leafy greens, and foods like whole grains, berries, and walnuts may help lower cholesterol without medication. Consistent exercise can also help keep cholesterol levels low. Schwarzenegger, at age 74, continues to train regularly, previously sharing in his newsletter that his workout split is six days a week, focusing on a different body part each day.

2/23/2022,"A woman in Tennessee is accused of exchanging items for sexual encounters with nine high school boys she spoke with on social media, officials said. Melissa A. Blair, 38, of Englewood — about 60 miles northeast of Chattanooga — was indicted on Feb. 15 on 23 charges, including 18 counts of aggravated statutory rape, four counts of human trafficking by patronizing prostitution and one count of solicitation of a minor, McMinn County Sheriff Joe Guy announced.Guy said the victims, students at McMinn Central High School, were all minors when Blair had sexual encounters with them in exchange for items between the spring of 2020 and until late 2021. He declined to specify what those items were during a news conference last week. Blair could not be reached for comment by NBC News. Her attorney, Robert Kurtz, declined comment on Tuesday. McMinn County Director of Schools Lee Parkison said during the joint media briefing he was surprised the allegations against Blair — a parent who was involved in booster clubs — stayed secret for so long, especially in the age of social media. Authorities began investigating Blair after district officials were alerted to her through an anonymous letter, Parkison said. “I want to thank the person who put this anonymous letter in my office,” he said. “Without them, this could still be going on.” The sheriff’s office received a referral from the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services on Dec. 9, Guy said. About a week later, detectives with the sheriff’s office went to Blair’s home and spoke with her. Authorities later executed a search warrant at her house, according to the sheriff’s office. Stephen Crump, district attorney general with the Tenth Judicial District, said during last week’s media briefing that investigators suspect there are more victims. “In a case like this, it truly is about those who were victimized,” he said. “It’s not about a headline. It’s not about a trial. It’s about trying to make, as much as possible, our victims whole.” In a statement Tuesday, Crump said: “We are extremely concerned that other victims may exist. I know that this is a difficult topic for children and parents to discuss. It is crucial that we identify any additional victims. We believe that several may exist. I am asking any victims and their parents to come forward if they haven’t.” Two of Blair’s alleged victims are now adults, Guy said. According to the indictment, the victims, who were identified by their dates of birth, were born between the years 2003 and 2006. Blair turned herself in to the sheriff’s office last week and later posted $100,000 bond, authorities said. Her arraignment is scheduled for Monday, Crump said. Officials ask if anyone knows of additional victims to contact the McMinn County Sheriff’s Office at 423-745-5620 or the Tenth Judicial District at 423-744-2830.",U.S./NBC News,Tennessee woman accused of trading items for sexual encounters with 9 high school students,https://news.yahoo.com/tennessee-woman-accused-trading-items-192004164.html
