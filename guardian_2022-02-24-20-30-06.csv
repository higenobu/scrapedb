2/24/2022,"I’ve been praying for Facebook’s collapse ever since it attained liftoff. In a 2007 article, I predicted that “your creepy ex-co-workers will kill Facebook” by demanding to know why you won’t “friend” them, prompting an exodus to the next platform. That was the social network cycle back then: a new network opens, and you and the people you genuinely like enjoy a rollicking group chat until all the people you have to pretend to like show up. That’s the double-edged sword of products that rely on “network effects” – the economists’ term for a product that gets better when more people use it. Sure, you might join Facebook because your friends are all there (and more people might sign up because you’re there), but that also means that every time your friends leave Facebook, it’s a reason for you to leave, too.  My prediction failed. For a decade and a half, Facebook resisted the fate of all the social networks that preceded it. In hindsight, it’s easy to see why: it cheated. The company used investor cash to buy and neutralize competitors (“Kids are leaving Facebook for Insta? Fine, we’ll buy Insta. We know you value choice!”). It allegedly spied on users through the deceptive use of apps such as Onavo and exploited the intelligence to defeat rivals. More than anything, it ratcheted up “switching costs.” “Switching costs” is another economic term: it means “the price you pay when you switch from one service to another.” Switching from Facebook to a rival means saying goodbye to the communities, friends and customers you hang out with on the platform. Normally, tech has really low switching costs: want to change from T-Mobile to Verizon? Just port your number. Your friends don’t even have to know you did; they can still call you and you them. Tech’s rock-bottom switching costs are what kept the industry so dynamic in its early days. Microsoft could deploy an army of corporate salespeople to turn Microsoft Office into an industry standard, then Apple could come along and reverse-engineer the Office formats and make the interoperable iWork office suite. That means that Windows users could switch to the Mac and open their Word docs in Pages, their Excel spreadsheets in Numbers and their PowerPoints in Keynote. It’s different for Facebook. The company’s ascendancy coincided with an overall concentration in the tech sector, and, with it, laws that protected winners of the latest round of the interoperability wars from new challengers. Apple was able to reverse-engineer its way out of the Microsoft Office trap, but woe betide a company that tries the same trick on Apple – try to make a program that lets you run iPhone apps on an Android device, or read the media files you buy in Apple’s book, movie or music stores, and you will quickly discover that the law is now on the sides of the giants, not the upstarts. That same legal shift is how Facebook has kept its switching costs high. Fifteen years ago, it was safe to make a Facebook-MySpace bridge that would let you leave MySpace but stay in touch with your friends there by scraping your MySpace inbox and moving the waiting messages to your Facebook inbox. Try to build one of those bridges today – blasting an escape tunnel through Facebook’s walled garden – and Facebook will sue you until the rubble bounces. But high switching costs have their limits. If you make your service terrible enough, a certain number of users will find the cost of switching preferable to the pain of staying. And as users leave, network effects start to work in reverse: though every user that joins makes your service more valuable, every user that leaves makes the service less valuable. If you’re only on Facebook to stay in touch with a small group of friends, each one of those friends who departs makes it easier for you to make the jump, too. And once you go, it’s even easier for the rest of the group to bail. This is very bad news for Facebook. After years of slowing US growth, Facebook just experienced its first-ever US shrinkage, which precipitated a $230bn stock crash, the largest in global corporate history. Though most of Facebook’s users are global, its US users generate far more profit than users in the rest of the world. Losing a US user is expensive. Even more important: the US is Facebook’s home base, and its US user base is its main bargaining chip in resisting US regulation, and in securing US support in its regulatory battles abroad. Speaking of regulatory battles abroad: Facebook is on the brink of having its business model declared illegal under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Fending off that scenario will depend on vast capital expenditures and friendly European regulators, and Facebook’s running short on both. Oh, and Europeans are Facebook’s second most valuable users. Admittedly, when a company’s shares decline, it’s not like the company itself has lost any money – those losses hit shareholders, not the business itself. However, Facebook’s costs and share-price are intimately bound together, thanks to tech firms’ reliance on stock grants as a way of scoring a discount on their wage-bills. Engineers, lawyers, and other high-paid, in-demand professionals are glad to take much of their compensation in stock, betting that the company’s share price will balloon and that they can cash out their shares and keep their winnings, thanks to the tax-preferred status of capital gains – in most of the world, the wages you earn for doing useful work are taxed at a much higher rate than the winnings you get from lucky bets on stocks. Even before its stock fell off a cliff, Facebook was mired in a multi-year hiring crisis. Nobody wanted to work for Facebook because it’s a terrible company that makes terrible products that everyone hates and only use because the company has rigged the system to punish users for switching. Facebook was already paying a wage premium, offering sweeteners to in-demand workers in exchange for checking their consciences at the door. Those sweeteners mostly took the form of shares, which means that all those morally flexible “Metamates” got a hefty pay-cut when the company’s stock price fell off a cliff. Expect a lot of them to leave – and expect the company to have to pay even more to replace them. Companies with falling share prices can’t use share grants to attract workers. Facebook is now famously trying to pivot (ugh) to virtual reality to save itself. It’s an expensive gambit. It’s going to alienate a lot of its users. It’s going to alienate a lot of its in-demand workers. It’s going to freak out a lot of regulators. Meanwhile, the switching costs for people who want to jump ship keep getting lower. It’s not merely that fewer and fewer of the people you want to talk with are still on Facebook. Even if there’s someone whose virtual company you can’t bear to part with, lawmakers in the US and Europe are working on legislation that would force Facebook to allow third parties to “federate” new services with it. That would mean that you could quit Facebook and join an upstart rival – say, one by a privacy-respecting nonprofit or even a user-owned co-op – and still exchange messages with the communities, customers and family you left behind on Facebook’s sinking ship. For 15 years, I’ve been waiting for Facebook to suffer the fate of every network-effects-driven success story – to experience the precipitous decline that is triggered by people leaving the service and taking the value they brought to it with them. Facebook now has to somehow retain users who are fed up to the eyeballs with its never-ending failures and scandals, while funding a pivot to VR, while fending off overlapping salvoes of global regulatory challenges to its business model, while paying a massive wage premium to attract and retain the workers that it needs to make any of this happen. All that, amid an exodus of its most valuable users and a frontal regulatory assault on its ability to extract revenues from those users’ online activities. Stein’s Law holds that “if something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” Facebook can’t go on forever. Cory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist and journalist.

2/24/2022,"If Terry and June had wrestled with ennui, the result might have resembled An Hour and a Half Late, a two-hander that comes close to confronting the terror of an unfulfilled life before skating blithely over it. Peter (Griff Rhys Jones), a west London tax consultant, is ready for dinner, if only his wife, Laura (Janie Dee), would shake a leg. How can he hustle her off to an evening of jovial conversation with friends, however, when she is using words such as “chasm” and “precipice” to describe her life? As they bicker comically, their marriage threatens to unravel, beginning with the discovery that Laura didn’t have an affair after all …  Though the pair touch on pertinent topics, such as the sexist expectations that left Laura no option but to “dwindle to a wife”, the humour rarely graduates beyond sitcom level: quinoa, media studies degrees and man-buns are all offered up for derision. Matters improve with two slapstick set-pieces, including an erotically charged duet of squeaking floorboards. Jones’s late comedy partner, Mel Smith, starred in Gérald Sibleyras and Jean Dell’s comedy back in 2006, but while the play predates Yasmina Reza’s God of Carnage, it has also been superseded by it. Whereas Reza showed the collapse of etiquette leading to savagery among the bourgeoisie, An Hour and a Half Late pulls back from that brink at every opportunity. Dee captures Laura’s scattershot thought processes but never convinces as a former political radical; Jones starts out frazzled and doesn’t have many other places to go. What they do convey is the couple’s mutual affection. The irony is that Peter and Laura’s showdown reveals not hidden fissures but deep-rooted solidarity. They seem interested in, and amused by, one another in a way that renders all other obstacles moot. If the message is that wealthy white couples in big houses have problems too, it could hardly have come at a worse time. The pay-off – that someone else will always clean up after the rich – would have more punch if this production felt like an indictment of complacency as opposed to a nice long soak in the stuff.

2/24/2022,"British Gas has said energy supplies to its eight million customers will be unaffected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but declined to comment on what soaring prices might mean for household bills. Russia, which launched a full invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, is responsible for a third of Europe’s natural gas and about 10% of global oil production.  About a third of Russian gas supplies to Europe usually travels through pipelines crossing Ukraine, and there are fears retaliation against economic sanctions on Russia could disrupt supplies. “What we have made quite clear is that when we make a commitment to gas and electricity for customers we deliver on that,” said Chris O’Shea, chief executive of Centrica, the parent company of the UK’s biggest energy supplier. “We can deliver everything to consumers that we said we would.” The escalation of the crisis in Ukraine, which world leaders fear could spark the biggest war in Europe since 1945, sent the price of oil above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 and resulted in a 40% rise in the price of gas. O’Shea, who said he would not take his £1.1m annual bonus in acknowledgment of the soaring energy bills facing consumers, refused to comment on what the invasion might mean for bills. “It is unprecedented what we see at the moment,” he said. “I don’t think it will help anyone to speculate what this might mean [regarding prices]. We have to wait and see how this might unfold, it is absolutely unprecedented, we will have to wait and see.” His comments came as Centrica reported a £767m pre-tax profit last year, compared with a £577m loss in 2020, helped by the £2.3bn sale of its Direct Energy subsidiary and the benefit of higher commodity prices at its oil and gas exploration business. O’Shea defended the bumper year, saying that in line with its performance, the company had significantly increased its tax payments, to almost £500m. “Pre-tax profits across the globe are taxed highly so governments get their fair share,” he said. “Our tax bill is up almost £500m, there has been a huge tax windfall for governments. The vast majority has quite rightly gone to governments.” The company also said it had paid back £27m it received in 2020 through the UK government’s coronavirus job retention scheme. British Gas has taken on more than 700,000 customers from energy suppliers that have gone bankrupt because of soaring wholesale energy prices – the total is now at 29 – meaning last year was the first since 2010 it added customers overall. Centrica said that up to 1,000 roles would be cut this year, the last stage of a re-organisation that started in 2020 to remove 4,000 positions.",News/Business,British Gas says energy supplies safe after Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/british-gas-says-gas-supplies-safe-after-russian-invasion

2/24/2022,"The Montevideo carnival, which runs from January into early March is a well-kept secret with far fewer tourists than Rio’s more famous event, and has its own unique traditions and history. I stumbled on it when backpacking a few years ago. I had settled downto sleep in a hotel when the manic banging of drums followed by singing and dancing in the streets below kicked off a month of carnival celebrations. All of the capital’s barrios have samba contests, gigs, poetry readings and outrageous costume parades. The carnival has its origins in slavery times and features a lot of candombe – a music and dance genre created by the descendants of liberated African slaves.Nick  Nothing prepared me for Salvador’s carniva, the world’s largest street party. For five days and nights the city’s streets are packed with more than a million revellers dancing to all kinds of Brazilian music. The scale can feel overwhelming at first, especially when a gigantic trio elétrico (a truck equipped with a colossal sound system and a 10-piece band on top) thunders by with hundreds of people dancing, singing and pogoing in its wake. The only thing to do is warm up with few a few beers, then take the plunge and join the throng for an absolute riot of a time.Alex Robbins A few years ago, an Italian train strike left me stranded in Ivrea, 30 miles north of Turin, but I was lucky enough to be there during carnival and ended up staying the weekend to enjoy the wild festivities and atmosphere. The climax of street dancing, parades eating and drinking was the Battle of the Oranges. Using surplus oranges traditionally imported from Sicily, the townspeople pelted a few costumed leaders dressed as a local tyrant and his family from the 12th century. The festival celebrates Ivrea’s freedom from this evil man. The cruel ruler was about to rape a local miller’s daughter, but she escaped and decapitated him (as you do): the oranges are said to represent the tyrant’s testicles. A girl is chosen each year to represent the daughter. This year’s event starts on Saturday (26 February) and finishes on 1 March.Gonca For a close encounter with ancient traditions, drop into a Maltese Festa celebrating the village patron saint. Staying in Qormi in 2018, I accidentally caught the feast of Saint George in late June over an initially baffling few days. Every night red-shirted paraders passed through the square beneath the apartment windows, carrying a statue of the dragon slayer through the narrow streets to the sound of a brass band and fireworks. Strings of lights and bright red tapestries hung from flaking baroque buildings. On the festa’s last night, our little square turned party hub, all swaying red shirts and music, while temporary statues were pedestalled using precarious ladder rails. A rowdy secret carnival.Culann Robinson The Reach Ride, a mass 11-mile cycle ride from Cambridge to Reach Fair, is a new tradition meeting a very old one. Reach Fair was granted its charter by King John in 1201. Taking place originally on Rogation Monday and now on the first bank holiday in May, it is opened at noon by the mayor of Cambridge, who then throws pennies to the crowd. There are fairground rides, market stalls and entertainments, including dancing by the Devil’s Dyke Morris Men. Their name comes from the Anglo-Saxon earthwork which stretches 7½ miles from Reach to Woodditton. The next Reach Fair is on 2 May. All cyclists are welcome and encouraged to dress up according to themes.Sharon Pinner  Guardian Travel readers' tips Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels. A selection of tips will be featured online and may appear in print. To enter the latest competition visit the readers' tips homepage - Held around Ash Wednesday (2 March this year), Fasching, the German carnival season, is a staple Teutonic calendar highlight (key dates are: Fat Thursday, which is today, 24 Feb; Shrove Monday, 28 Feb; and Fat Tuesday, 1 March). Traditionally, the Catholic regions celebrate with the greatest intensity, with Kölner (Cologne) Karneval (finishes 2 March this year) almost certainly the biggest. However, its less-famous cousin is in Heidelberg, where witches, jesters, the local mayor and up to 100,000 others parade through the Altstadt towards the cathedral, many in medieval costume, and all to a thumping techno beat. Sadly this isn’t taking place this year once again because of Covid.Tim Moss The Mardi Gras at Universal Studios, Orlando, is amazing. I’ll never forget my late husband roaring with laughter as he caught the strings of beads the characters on the floats throw to the crowd. There are daytime and night parades as well as concerts, scavenger hunts and themed foods. I can’t wait to go again with my grandson. This year it runs until 24 April.Diane Trinidad is the mother of Caribbean carnivals, a riot of music, brilliant costumes and wining (or dancing) in the street. For me, though, the highlight was Panorama, the steel pan band competition away from the main procession. Established in 1963, it’s taken incredibly seriously by the island’s 80 or so pan bands, with qualifying competitions taking place all year. For the final, on the Saturday of carnival, bands of up to 200 musicians create music that’s both exhilating and orchestral in its scope. I meant to pop in for just a short time but was mesmerised by band after band and stayed long into the night.Gloria B The origins of Barranquilla’s huge carnival, which starts on the Saturday before Ash Wednesday (26 February this year), are shrouded in mystery. But it’s known that it really became a thing in the 19th century and may have been started – before then – by slaves. It’s now a huge celebration of different cultures and people and their music, blending African and South American styles, culminating in mourning for the death of “Joselito Carnaval” – not a real person, in case you were wondering. The food is fantastic – a real Caribbean influence on the already varied Colombian fare, though I can’t pretend I ever really took to fried catfish. I still feel somewhat stunned by my visit to this sultry, intensely colourful city during carnival – visually and aurally – but most of all by the sheer vitality of the people.Jock A few years ago I visited Barbados for a once-in-a-lifetime holiday with various family members in midsummer. I hadn’t heard about the Crop Over Carnival – which this year takes place between 27 July and 2 August. My sister’s husband said we should pop along to Bridgetown and check it out. We were reluctant to take a day off from the beach but soon got into the spirit of things. Incredible scenes ensued, possibly fuelled by regular infusions of local Banks beer. It was Grand Kadooment Day, the culmination of the whole affair. The festival itself began centuries ago in sugar plantation times and some traditions endure – there’s a King and a Queen of the Crop for starters. In Spring Gardens I lost my companions for quite some time. And I quite like soca music now.Henrietta",Lifestyle/Travel,Celebrate good times and ancient traditions: readers’ favourite carnivals,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/24/celebrate-good-times-and-ancient-traditions-readers-favourite-carnivals
2/24/2022,"It began in darkness soon after 4.30am local time. There were distant explosions in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and the whine of car alarms. A nation shook itself awake. What had been foretold by western governments, by experts, and – late in the day – by the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was actually happening. Russia was attacking and invading. Vladimir Putin’s apparent goal: the subjugation of a nation, a culture, a people. It was unthinkable in the twenty-first century. And yet, with imperial swagger, Russian troops, tanks and planes were on the move.  The disaster unfurled itself on a grey, ordinary Thursday morning, sprinkled by rain. By 5am friends and loved ones were ringing each other, peering into their phones, making life and death decisions. Stay or flee? Some packed and got ready to leave; others took refuge in apartment block basements. An underground garage began to fill up in Yaroslaviv Val, close to Kyiv’s historic golden gate, dating back to the eleventh century and to Kyivan Rus, a pre-Moscow dynasty. A family arrived. A mother shepherded her two bleary-eyed children to safety. The children were carrying colouring books, scant defence against Russian missiles. By breakfast the scale of Russia’s multitudinous military assault became clear. Putin’s ambitions, it turned out, went well beyond the Donbas region, whose separatist territories he recognised earlier this week. They included practically the entire country: east, south, north and even west. The port city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov; the city of Kharkiv, home to 1.4 million people; Odesa on the Black Sea and Kherson; Ukrainian-controlled towns and villages on the Donbas frontline – all were being pulverised and bombed. Russia was clinically targeting Ukraine’s defences: aerodromes, military bases, ammunition dumps. It was shock and awe, done with a ruthless indifference to human cost. Amid this grandiose onslaught there were moments of normality. A few Kyiv residents emerged to walk their dogs. Queues formed outside cash machines. Most cafes were closed but Aroma Coffee had opened as usual, selling croissants and take-outs. The mood was one of shock, fear and quiet disgust that Putin – without reason or rational pretext – had decided to unleash war. “Russia is 100% wrong,” said Viktor Alexeyvich, speaking in the capital’s Maidan Nezalezhnosti square. Behind him was the city’s independence monument, a marble column once topped with a statue of Vladimir Lenin. Perched on top – at least for now – was a woman with a rose branch in her arms, symbolising Ukraine’s independence, beneath a golden capital. What would he do now? “I’ve going to take my grandson out of the city. And then I will come back,” he said. “I don’t have any weapons but I’m ready to defend my country. Maybe the national guard will help.” Alexeyevich said he had rung his son when he heard the first explosions and turned on the TV. He had watched President Zelenskiy address the nation, introduce martial law, and urge citizens to be calm, he said. “Putin is the aggressor here. He’s invade Ukraine because we don’t want to live under his strictures, his model.” The normally-busy square full of tourists and shoppers was sparser than usual. A few people waited in the rain for a municipal trolley-bus. For months, Kyiv’s pro-western government has said Ukraine will resist Russian attack and occupation. It says the country’s armed forces are in better shape than in 2014, when they wilted under superior Russian firepower. On paper, this is true: Ukraine has 220,000 troops, 400,000 veterans with combat experience and modern weapons recently supplied by the US, UK and other allies. Ukraine’s operational command reported some early successes on Thursday in beating back attacks from the rebel-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, run for the past eight years by Moscow’s loyal proxies. And yet the cars streaming out of Kyiv told their own story. From early in the day the streets were jammed, as civilians sought a way out – to Zhytomyr, west of the city, and from there to Lviv and the Polish border. Traffic on the boulevards moved slowly. There was no panic as such but an awareness that the window to leave was beginning to close. Reports suggested Russian formations were advancing to the capital from Belarus and the north, two hours’ drive and 160kms away. They had broken through the international check-point and – seemingly – were trundling Kyiv-wards through a primordial landscape of pine trees and swamp. It seemed Belarus was facilitating war on Kyiv too. Oleg Olegovich, a 30-year-old officer in the Ukrainian army, said he had been summoned at 4am to come in for work. His office was in the centre of Kyiv. “Civilians are leaving. But we will stay,” he said. Could Ukraine defeat mighty Russia, with its vast air power and Black Sea navy? “We will smash them,” he said. “The military is in good shape, our communications are working.” Lyudmila – a young city police officer who had popped out for coffee – said she would carry on. “I didn’t sleep last night,” she said. “I tried to sleep before work but I couldn’t manage it.” “Cheerio,” she said with a smile. Nearby, the trade union building overlooking the Maidan played the Ukrainian national anthem on a loudspeaker. Few were around to hear it. It played a key role in the Euromaidan protests in 2013 and 2014 against the country’s pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. The uprising saw Yanukovych flee to Russia. Since then the country had moved in an emphatically pro-EU and pro-Nato direction. Putin responded in 2014 by annexing Crimea and kickstarting a pro-Russian revolt in the east. Eight years on, he seems determined to stop Ukraine’s westward integration forever. His tactics are familiar from Russia’s bloody wars in Chechnya: brute military force. President Zelenskiy – a TV star and comedian before he turned to politics – was still in Kyiv and at work, his press service said. Historians may rebuke him for failing to prepare Ukraine for an inevitable Kremlin attack. But in a speech on Wednesday evening – the eve of invasion as it turned out – Zelenskiy addressed the Russian people directly. He reminded them of Ukraine and Russia’s joint ties – of family, friendship and of love – telling them that the portrait painted by Russian state TV of a fascist Ukraine bore no resemblance to its vibrant, modern and tolerant reality. It was his finest hour. Zelenskiy’s personal fate and that of the country he leads remains unclear. It seems likely Russia will demand his capitulation and replacement with a pro-Russian puppet administration. For the moment he is in power – just. Meanwhile, Kyiv’s familiar rhythms continued. The bells of St Michael’s domed monastery tolled the hour, as they have for centuries. The baroque building sits across the square from Saint Sophia cathedral, an eleventh century building done in vivid turquoise. Locals protesting outside the now-empty Russian embassy on Tuesday pointed out wryly that when it was constructed Moscow was a mere forest. The square’s children’s playground was empty, home now to a few jackdaws and a stray dog. Europe was at war. The world – two decades into the century – had reached a crisis that was likely to reverberate well beyond the early overcast hours of invasion and predation. It was Mikhail Bulgakov in his masterful novel The White Guard, written almost a century ago, who dubbed Kyiv the City, with an upper case C. The City will endure. But it seems only a matter of time before it has new, harsher masters.",News/World news,Stay or flee?

2/24/2022,"Ask Rosa Wells to list the highlights from her career teaching in further education (FE), and she’s spoiled for choice. There’s the young man she supported to do a higher national certificate (HNC) in electrical and electronic engineering, who then secured his dream job in Formula One, and the student she encouraged to go to university, who now has a master’s in engineering leadership. She’s also particularly proud of the mature students she’s helped balance studies with their family life, and the recent honour of being awarded a technical teaching fellowship for outstanding achievement in science and engineering. “I remember going out for dinner with friends a few years after I started teaching in FE, and they all said they wished they had a job they loved as much as I loved mine,” she says. “I feel so lucky to have found such a rewarding career.”  Wells grew up in Birmingham and started her professional life in the aerospace manufacturing industry. She was always fascinated by how things worked, and as a young child was constantly taking her toys apart with a screwdriver. Aeroplanes in particular captivated her. “I didn’t understand how these huge aircraft got into the sky. When I was about 10, I decided I wanted to be a pilot because then I’d find out how they worked. A family member who was an engineer said: ‘Well, pilots don’t know how they work but engineers do.’ So that was it. Engineering it was.” Straight after A-levels, Wells secured a year-long industrial placement through the Engineering Development Trust, joining Lucas Aerospace, which manufactured the electronic engine control system for Rolls-Royce. She impressed her team so much that the company paid for her to do an aerospace engineering degree in Manchester, while working for the company over the summer holidays. Later she worked in France, researching whether the noise pollution of aircraft could be reduced by adjusting the shape of the jet engine’s nozzle. But neither manufacturing nor research felt like the right fit. “Manufacturing was about interacting with lots of people and problem solving, but I didn’t really find it stimulating enough,” she says. “Research was very interesting and stimulating, but I really missed the people.” ‘It’s really important that we’re not just offering courses that students want to do but training that will develop into careers,’ says Wells Back in the UK, Wells found herself thinking about how much she’d enjoyed helping her peers with their studies at university, and started to wonder if teaching could be the answer. “I knew people who taught in FE and they encouraged me to give it a go.” With no previous teaching experience or qualifications, she was offered a job at Fareham college, near Southampton. Wells joined as an engineering lecturer, teaching in mechanical, electrical and aeronautical engineering for 18 hours a week. At the same time, she began studying part-time for a PGCE in post-compulsory education and training, funded by her employer. “I instantly loved teaching in FE, but it was totally different to what I expected,” she says. “For one thing, there’s a huge diversity in the level and experience among the students. I was teaching 16-year-olds right the way through to 40- or 50-year-olds. But I enjoyed that challenge. I had to think about how to plan interesting lessons that would engage all learners at all levels. I learned to ride the highs and lows when one lesson worked really well and the next didn’t quite hit the mark.” Today, Wells is the executive director for employment, skills and IoT (Institute of Technology) at Solihull College and University Centre. It’s a hybrid role that combines teaching students to develop their apprenticeships, projects and work-based learning portfolios, with leading the regional IoT, which coordinates the colleges and universities in Birmingham and Solihull to support the manufacturing and engineering sector. “It’s really important that we’re not just offering courses that students want to do but training that will develop into careers,” she says. “And it’s not just about supporting the engineers of the future, but also about helping our existing engineering workforce to upskill as well. Because the college now teaches from level 1 (pre-GCSE) up to degree level, we’ve often got learners who have really specialist experience in certain sectors or technologies who can help our other students. It’s about building that whole cycle of learning, making sure you draw people in to enhance the experience for others.” As well as landing dream jobs with F1, Wells’ students have gone on to do master’s degrees, degree apprenticeships, and work with prestigious companies such as Rolls-Royce, Aston Martin Lagonda, and National Express. One even joined the British bobsleigh team after studying for a BTec engineering diploma. Despite having worked in FE for 15 years now, Wells is as passionate about engineering as ever, and is keen to encourage others in the industry to share their skills. “If you love engineering, you’re a natural problem-solver who is inquisitive and analytical, and that’s exactly what we need in FE,” she says. “Colleges can be really flexible and will support you with training; you don’t need a teaching qualification to start, we’re always interested to see what experience people can bring to our learners.” For Wells, FE has offered a level of career satisfaction she feared she’d never find. “Knowing you’re changing learners’ lives, getting to know them, hearing about the challenges they’ve faced and what they want to achieve, has been brilliant,” she says. “I’ve loved learning how to be innovative with my teaching and working collaboratively to continuously improve. I’ve found something I absolutely love.” Your skills are more valuable than you realise. If you have relevant experience working in industry, you can start teaching in FE with no formal teaching qualifications.

2/24/2022,"Christian Nunez Fuentes’s path into further education (FE) has been one of twists and turns. Brought up in Peru, at the age of 22 he moved to the UK to study English – a language he proceeded to learn from scratch. That led to a 13-year career in retail IT, initially as a technician and then as a business account manager and supervisor, in areas such as customer service, logistics and sales. Deciding it was time for a change, in 2016 Nunez Fuentes set up his own web design company. At the same time he took a Higher National Certificate (HNC) and Higher National Diploma (HND) in computing and systems development at Bedford college, an FE provider based in the town of the same name.  It was the head of computing at Bedford college who suggested he might want to make more of his knowledge by teaching in FE alongside running his business. It was an idea Nunez Fuentes embraced with enthusiasm. Part of his web business already involved tutoring, and while he was studying, others on his courses often turned to him when they didn’t understand something. And so, for the past three-and-a-half years, Nunez Fuentes has been a “dual professional” – working four days a week at Bedford college alongside running his business, all while studying for his PGCE with the University of Bedfordshire. Working in the industry as well as teaching lets Nunez Fuentes keep on top of the latest developments, benefiting his students Nunez Fuentes’s job at Bedford college makes full use of the range of skills he acquired in industry: he teaches development, website design, ecommerce technologies, marketing strategies and project management to students from levels 1 to 5 (equivalent to higher national diploma or foundation degree). He likes to incorporate lots of practical work, including gaming, into his lessons to “break out from the normal monotonous old-fashioned way of teaching”. For example, outside of teaching the theory of how to design a webpage and complying with user requirements, he sets learners practical exercises. “The activity consists of designing a webpage about a specific subject. This way, students learn how to create different layouts using different images to produce the page for a specific product or service. “After designing a page, it’s time for coding. This is another hands-on practical activity where they not only learn to code the page step by step, but they also gain a realistic experience creating and building a webpage/website using real software and resources.” His favourite thing about working in FE is the variety. “Even though you prepare the lessons very similarly, every day is different,” he says. “You have to adjust to the mood in the room, and sometimes you have to improvise to grab the group’s attention. That’s what I like – it’s challenging sometimes but it’s very interesting. Time goes really quickly.” And it’s not only his days that are diverse, but his learners too; while most students on the full-time courses are aged between 16 and 20, on the part-time commercial courses the oldest student is about 50. “The way the youngest learn, the middle range of adults learn, and the older ones learn, is completely different,” he explains. “They have different ways of taking in and retaining information, so you need to change the way you teach, or the way you convey a message, so they can understand.” Although it’s a full week – Nunez Fuentes works 32 hours at the college and all day on Friday on his business – he enjoys the flexibility of the job. He has three children, aged 13, nine and four, and has arranged his working hours so that he can pick them up from school. He also likes the fact that his holidays are generally the same as theirs. “Sometimes as parents, you get to a point where you find you want to develop your career but you are scared to do something completely new,” he says. The great advantage of teaching in FE, he explains, is that it offers you a fresh way to use the skills you have acquired in industry and, like him, you can even teach alongside your current job. Continuing to have one foot in industry has not only benefited Nunez Fuentes – allowing him to stay up to date with all the latest industry developments – but also his students. He’s been able to provide work experience for some of his learners, and runs a student competition to design a webpage for a real business; the winners not only receive a prize but have the opportunity to work with the company to develop their website. That has been really satisfying, he says, “because I can see the fruits of what I’ve been teaching them”. Still at a relatively early stage of his FE career, Nunez Fuentes’s immediate goal is to become a course manager. Ultimately, he’d like to run his web design competition on a larger scale and, after a few years, perhaps work on helping the government reform the curriculum. For now though, he’s relishing the flexibility and range of his portfolio career. “I’m really happy with what I’m doing now, because I get to have time with my family, and get to enjoy what I’m doing as well,” he says. “If you are a person who is bored of the monotony of a normal day-to-day job, this is a great opportunity to change lives while still working in the sector you love.” Your skills are more valuable than you realise. If you have relevant experience working in industry, you can start teaching in FE with no formal teaching qualifications.

2/24/2022,"Matthew Cappell has had to get used to proving himself. At just 24, he found himself teaching an evening carpentry class to students some 20 years older than he was. “I think they were a bit surprised when I walked in,” he says. “But after I demonstrated a skills test – cutting skirting boards on a jig by hand – they realised I knew what I was doing.” Fast-forward 10 years and Cappell is now the head of the construction school at Moulton college in Northamptonshire, making him one of the youngest on the leadership team. Despite progressing quickly up the ranks, teaching in further education (FE) is actually Cappell’s second career. He spent seven years working on building sites all over the country until the recession hit. “I’d never even thought about teaching,” he says. “But in 2010 my boss said he didn’t have as much work for me any more and Rugby college offered me a few days as a technician. Pretty soon they asked me to work five days a week and it just spiralled from there.  “To be honest, I wasn’t expecting it to take off the way it did, or to enjoy it as much as I have.” Cappell’s own experience at school was a tale of two halves. He attended an all-boys’ school in Coventry and enjoyed it, but in year 10, he was diagnosed with dyslexia. “I could read pretty quickly, but I’d always had trouble spelling and with grammar. Getting the diagnosis was a relief, everything made a bit more sense and I got a bit of extra time in exams, which helped me process the questions better.” After school, Cappell enrolled at Rugby college to study carpentry. “I was like a duck to water, I loved it,” he says. “There’s obviously some theory involved, but I liked that there was something tangible coming out of every class.” Once he qualified as a carpenter, Cappell quickly expanded his knowledge to help with bricklaying, tiling, fitting kitchens, plastering, and more, in building sites of all sizes countrywide. “It was something different every day.” But there were downsides as well – the time away from home was not always welcome, and then work started to dry up when the recession hit. Getting a job in FE seemed like a good way to pass some time until things picked up again. As a technician, Cappell was initially responsible for maintaining the safety of the class machines and pre-cutting the timber for students to use. He quickly progressed to helping teach practical lessons and evening classes. He moved between the sites of the Warwickshire College Group and Coventry college, where he spent time as a National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) workplace assessor, visiting students working on building sites. “It was really nice to see learners in their workplaces, putting the skills we were teaching them at college to good use,” he says. Although he had no formal teaching qualifications when he started, Cappell has since completed the Certificate in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector (CTLLS), Training, Assessment and Quality Assurance (TAQA) and Internal Quality Assurance (IQA) qualifications. He took these alongside his teaching and all were paid for by the college. ‘I’m designing a curriculum that gives the industry and my learners what they need,’ says Cappell In his role at Moulton college, he combines more than 11 years of FE experience with his passion and knowledge of his sector, managing 30 staff and being responsible for approximately 600 students. “Everything construction-related falls under me – carpentry, bricklaying, plumbing, electrical maintenance operations, stonemasonry, furniture and construction management,” he says. “It’s making sure I’m designing a curriculum that gives the industry and my learners what they need.” And when he gets the chance to be in the classroom, he’s there like a shot. “I still love it. I’m really keen to meet the next generation of carpenters coming in.” Cappell’s story might sound exceptional, but he believes the skills you develop working in construction are perfectly transferable to teaching in FE. “When you’re working on site, you have to be resilient, you have to be organised. It might rain or materials might not turn up, so you have to find something else to do. And that can happen in teaching. You have to have that ability to problem solve and think on your feet.” For anyone who’s keen to share their skills with FE learners, his advice is simple: “Do it. Just jump in wholeheartedly. As long as you’re confident and you can talk about your subject passionately, students will respond to you. “It’s giving back really, isn’t it?” he adds. “Someone took the time to teach you, it’s now time to pass those skills on. I love meeting students who come into class thinking they can’t do something, seeing them progress and then getting that sense of achievement. It’s very rewarding.” Your skills are more valuable than you realise. If you have relevant experience working in industry, you can start teaching in FE with no formal teaching qualifications.

2/24/2022,"Taking up a new job can feel daunting – especially if you’re already well established in an industry you love. But as we all know, it’s often the scariest decisions that turn out to be the most rewarding. The Department for Education’s new further education (FE) teacher recruitment campaign aims to attract skilled industry professionals from a number of key sectors, including construction, engineering and manufacturing, legal, finance and accounting, digital/IT and health and social care.  Teaching in FE is a unique prospect, with benefits aplenty – from flexible, part-time contracts (which mean you can teach alongside your current job), to earning while you train. It’s a great way to share your skills, and change lives without changing careers. Intrigued? We spoke to six industry experts turned FE teachers to hear their first-hand experiences … ‘I feel like I’m giving a lot back’If you’d told a young Andy Foulks that one day he’d become an FE teacher, he’d have thought you were mad. “To be honest with you, even when I was driving to the interview, I was thinking: ‘Do I really want to do this? Is this too much of a change? Am I capable of standing up in front of a room full of people and delivering a subject?’” But this year, the 53-year-old entered his eighth year with Truro and Penwith college, where he’s the industrial lead for engineering. It comes after a 30-year career that saw Foulks work his way up from a toolmaker apprentice to a technical engineer. During his time in industry, he helped recruit and train more than 50 apprentices, and enjoyed watching them develop. Foulks spotted an engineering teaching job advertised at Truro and Penwith and decided to go to the interview to find out more. They offered him the job before he’d even made it back home. “It’s increased my faith in young people,” he says. “I feel like I’m giving a lot back to the engineering world, which I’ve had a successful career in.” Foulks clearly takes great pride in his job, which is hardly surprising, as some of his former students have gone on to work at Rolls-Royce and companies as far afield as Dubai. “I enjoy building students’ confidence and developing them not just as engineers, but as people as well. It’s just good to see them grow.” ‘It’s given me a new lease of life’The great thing about accountancy is the opportunity to work anywhere, says Anthony Mackin. The 57-year-old spent most of his professional life working in accounting in the media and third sector, before becoming self-employed – which is how he stumbled into FE. “I had some spare capacity,” he says. “So when I heard that the local FE college was looking for a part-time accountant I was keen to find out more.” Mackin attended a recruitment evening at Hopwood Hall college in Greater Manchester, where he was encouraged to also speak to the business lecturers who had a vacancy for someone to teach accountancy. He ended up applying for both jobs and was offered the lecturing role. “I always say I didn’t get the job I initially thought I wanted, but I got the job I needed,” he says. “It’s given me a new lease of life. I was in my 50s when I started teaching in FE and I feel so lucky that someone saw that potential in me.” Mackin now splits his time between Hopwood Hall college teaching professional accounting qualifications and University Campus Oldham, where he teaches third-year students studying for accountancy and financial services degrees. He’s also part of Hopwood Hall college’s teaching and learning champion group, developing innovative teaching strategies. “It’s surprised me how many opportunities there are in further education,” he says. “If you’re looking for a rewarding career where you’ll constantly be growing and developing, while making a positive difference to students, then I would recommend it to anybody.” ‘Now I go home happy’Moe Dhanji was looking for a new challenge when he left the construction industry to retrain as a teacher. After studying for his teaching qualifications part-time, Dhanji joined Peterborough college as an FE lecturer, working his way up to become the curriculum lead for technical construction over the next eight years. “Very few bricklayers get the chance to go into management, but there are a lot of opportunities in further education,” he says. “Society has a view that if you’re not academic, you go into the building trade, you start believing you’re not good enough to do anything else. Luckily my wife pushed me to make the move. She could see how much I loved it.” Now eight years into his FE career, it is clear Dhanji has found his calling. “You get a sense of pride building something but I get so much more satisfaction teaching someone else,” he says. “I have students who say if they weren’t in construction, they’d be in jail. They’ve turned their lives around. “I was born to teach and I have never ever looked back,” he adds. “There was something missing in my life when I worked in industry. Everything had become money-oriented and I didn’t have any job satisfaction. Now I go home happy. It’s an amazing thing. If you like working with people, you have to do it.” ‘If the shoe fits, it’s a lovely shoe to wear’Donna Green was at school when she realised she wanted to be an engineer. Sadly, she was discouraged by her teachers who told her it was a boy’s job. She went into administration instead and it wasn’t until she was in her mid-30s that she had the chance to retrain as a computer-aided design (CAD) designer at an electrical engineering company. “I got there in the end,” she says. “It seems crazy now that I just accepted that.” Green spent eight years in the company’s technical drawing room, combining work and study in the final four to take her Higher National Diploma (HND) at college. Once she’d finished the course, the head of the department asked if she’d ever thought about teaching in FE. She hadn’t, but jumped at the chance. “I am very creative but I’m also a people person, and a design office is a bit like being in a library. It’s very quiet, everyone’s concentrating,” she says. “I’m a chatter.” Green describes the early days of working in FE as a “baptism of fire”, but 11 years later, she’s the operations manager for engineering at Isle of Wight college, and is particularly keen to champion the women in her class. “What I love about further education is the students have chosen to specialise. You can see that joy when they realise education doesn’t need to be a burden,” she says. “Teaching is a vocation, but if you do take it on and the shoe fits, it’s a lovely shoe to wear.” ‘You have the chance to inspire a whole generation’Most people slow down when they retire, but having spent 22 years as a barrister, Naeem Siraj decided to try his hand at teaching in FE, aged 58. “I had become very despondent about the state of the law; that profit was being put before the pursuit of the right answer,” he says about his last few years in practice. “I felt that our future lies in these young minds, and if we train them well enough, with integrity and an appreciation of the power of the law, they will turn into fabulous lawyers.” He went on to teach undergraduates at Leeds City college, before settling at Barnsley college, teaching law at level 3. “Being able to instil that passion and interest in the law from an early age is so important,” he says. “It’s fantastic to see the recognition in their eyes when they understand the legal principles I’m explaining to them.” After spending six years in FE, Siraj has just retired for the second time, and now looks back fondly on his second career. “I’ve certainly never regretted it,” he says. “You have the chance to inspire a whole generation. I met some wonderful young people and got a great deal back.” ‘It’s such a creative, rewarding job’Ellisha Soanes has always been a champion for diversity and inclusion. The 32-year-old spent 10 years working across the health and social care sector, from supporting looked-after children and people with disabilities, to domiciliary care and the probation services. “I learned the importance of empowering people from all backgrounds and making sure they had a voice,” she says. After becoming a mum, Soanes longed for more flexibility in her career so she could balance her family life and her work supporting young people. “The hours in health and social care can be quite long, and a friend suggested teaching in FE – I was already running training in safeguarding and person-centred care so it felt like a good fit.” Six years later, she’s the equality, diversity and inclusion coordinator at West Suffolk college, in Bury St Edmunds, which has become the first in the UK to teach Black history all year round. Soanes also recently won the Association of Colleges’ president’s award for her contribution to equality and diversity. She still teaches health and social care, and says her industry experience has been invaluable. “It’s such a creative, rewarding job,” she says about FE. “As Nelson Mandela said, education is the most powerful weapon we have to change the world.” If you have relevant experience working in industry, you can start teaching in FE with no formal teaching qualifications – and you can even teach alongside your current job.
