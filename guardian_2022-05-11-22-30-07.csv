5/11/2022,"Elon Musk’s promise to reverse a Twitter ban on Donald Trump if he completes his takeover of the social media platform has prompted warnings that it will provoke a backlash among users and could clash with new internet safety laws. The Tesla CEO and world’s richest man is in the process of buying Twitter for $44bn (£35.6bn) and has described himself as a “free speech absolutist” with doubts about imposing permanent bans on Twitter accounts such as Trump’s, which was suspended after the Capitol riot last January. Musk confirmed on Tuesday that if he completed the deal he would lift the suspension on the former US president. “I would reverse the permanent ban,” he said, speaking via video link at a car industry conference organised by the Financial Times. “I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump. I think that was a mistake. It alienated the country and did not result in Donald Trump not having a voice. I think it was a morally bad decision and foolish in the extreme.” Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame in Chicago, said Musk would face a backlash if he reinstated Trump’s account. “If Musk is concerned that many people were upset that Trump was banned, he should see how many more people would be upset if Trump was not banned,” she said. “Musk only appears to be worried about the opinion of a small group of individuals who incite violence or perpetuate hate speech.” Twitter lost hundreds of thousands of users in the days after Elon Musk announced his takeover deal, as prominent accounts, including Katy Perry and Barack Obama, lost followers. At the same time, some rightwing Twitter accounts gained followers, according to data from the analytics site Social Blade. PEN America, a free-speech campaign group, said Musk needed a “better explanation” for letting Trump back. “Does he judge that Trump did not engage in incitement, or is he saying that a sitting president egging on his followers to violence or insurrection is fair game on Twitter?,” the group’s chief executive, Suzanne Nossel, asked. “With the great power that Musk seeks to wield over our public discourse comes great responsibility. I hope the law according to Musk consists of something more than one man’s bald decrees over who gets to stay or go on Twitter.” Media Matters for America, a liberal media watchdog, said Trump’s reinstatement would pave the way for leniency for other banned accounts, such as the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and the Trump ally Roger Stone. “It won’t just be Trump that Musk will restore. There are scores of people, from Alex Jones to Roger Stone to active white nationalists, who will also have their accounts restored,” said Angelo Carusone, president of MMA. Other banned accounts on Twitter include Katie Hopkins, the British rightwing commentator, and David Icke, a prominent British conspiracy theorist. Musk, speaking at the FT conference, said temporary suspensions could be a better solution. “If they say something that is illegal or otherwise just destructive to the world, then there should be perhaps a timeout, a temporary suspension, or that particular tweet should be made invisible or have very limited traction.” Musk’s comments came after he appeared in a video on Monday with the EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, in which the entrepreneur said new rules regulating internet content in the single market were “exactly aligned” with Twitter’s goals. Among the provisions in the Digital Services Act are a requirement that social media platforms allow users to flag illegal content in an “easy and effective way” so that it can be swiftly removed. In the UK, the online safety bill is also introducing content regulation. One policy expert, who help shape the regulatory framework of the bill, said the legislation would not prevent Trump returning but could cause the former president problems if his tweets incited violence. Today @elonmusk and I wanted to share a quick message with you on platform regulation 🇪🇺#DSA pic.twitter.com/nvP5FEXECY The bill requires platforms to prevent illegal harms, such as incitement to violence, but also has an extra provision for significant platforms, or “category 1” services, to protect adults from non-criminal but nonetheless harmful content – with definitions of “harmful content” to be set out in further legislation. However, the new regulations also require platforms to protect content of democratic importance, which could extend to Trump if he ran for office again. William Perrin, a trustee of the Carnegie UK Trust, said: “The [online safety bill] presents no obstacles to Twitter deciding to readmit Donald Trump. However, if Trump begins to incite violence, several questions are raised. Firstly, in Twitter’s own terms and conditions; secondly, are UK users at risk of violence? If they are, somehow, then the OSB measures against illegal content would be activated, possibly also those on protecting children from harm. He added: “Then, if Twitter is a ‘category 1’ service, the OSB duty to protect content of democratic importance would have to be balanced against the risk of harm from crime and harm to children as well as other harms to adults.”",News/Technology,"Reversing Trump Twitter ban will provoke user backlash, Elon Musk warned",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/11/reversing-trump-twitter-ban-will-provoke-user-backlash-elon-musk-warned
5/11/2022,"Might “the slap” – when Will Smith walloped Chris Rock at the Oscars ceremony – have been a publicity stunt? Amid the tidal wave of coverage the incident unleashed, that theory was floated in some quarters – at risk of letting Smith off the hook for his act of violence. I rather doubt it was a devious act of media manipulation, but more tickets for Rock’s touring show sold overnight after the Oscars than during the whole preceding month. Prices for his next gig spiked from $46 to more than $400. This week, the tour, Rock’s first in five years, arrives in the UK – hotly anticipated, because “the slap” has propelled the 57-year-old right back into the heart of the cultural conversation (where he has not been for a while). The incident is still fresh in our minds. When Dave Chappelle was attacked on stage last week with a replica handgun at the Netflix Is a Joke festival in LA, the comedian Paddy McGuinness called it “a direct result” of Will Smith’s Oscars behaviour. When Richard Ayoade hosted the Baftas last week, he joked repeatedly – of course he did – about the prospect of a repeat incident. The question, I suppose, is: will Rock’s show reward all this renewed interest? You can’t say he hasn’t earned it. The Oscars incident brought disgrace on both Smith and the event’s organisers, but Rock emerged with some credit – if not for the slightly unpleasant joke that prompted the slap, then for the remarkable sang-froid and professionalism with which he responded to it. One must hope the quality of the gags in his Ego Death World Tour show (I’m seeing it tomorrow) will outstrip that feeble Jada Pinkett Smith/GI Jane quip. Reviews of his US gigs are encouraging – if not for those looking to hear Rock’s side of the story. On stage, he has acknowledged that elephant in the room, of course, but with no more than a few remarks (“I’ve got my hearing back”). Instead, it sounds as though he’s sticking to the script of a show that was fully prepped and good to go before Smith offered him some eye-catching new material. Early reports suggest no great departure from what Rock offered UK audiences on his last visit, with 2018’s Total Blackout. That show was much touted as a soul-searching and confessional response to Rock’s divorce. But it wasn’t, really: it was – as Rock’s shows usually are – a combination of big-hitting and pointed material on racial politics, and some lazier material on the battle of the sexes. Back then, he joked about his wife taking his money, and about the challenges of dating in middle-age. He returns to both topics, it seems, in the new show, alongside material on Covid, polarised US politics and the shallowness of performative corporate anti-racism. I’m looking forward to it: Rock remains a fantastically expressive and often insightful comic who can build great connections with his audience. But I’m hoping too that, after a month to reflect, he might treat UK audiences to some fresh-minted “slap” material. To be in the eye of a media storm like that, caught in the crossfire of a hundred arguments about celebrity and chivalry, race and offence must, whether now or in the future, be a gift to an act like Rock – with greater comic potential, I’d argue, than more jokes about his alimony payments.",Arts/Stage,Chris Rock in a hard place: will he make comedy gold out of Will Smith’s slap?,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/11/chris-rock-in-a-hard-place-will-he-make-comedy-gold-out-of-will-smiths-slap
5/11/2022,"I’m from Newark, New Jersey but from the age of 13 or 14 I’d go into New York and hang out in book and record stores, looking at photos in books and on album covers. I was obsessed with the raw style of the photographs of Blondie or the punk scene over in Britain, and attracted to street culture in general. There was a school near me which had all the badass kids outside, with cool clothes, getting into fights. I wanted to go to a school like that but my aunts who lived in that neighbourhood would go: “Absolutely not. That’s a terrible school.” I was an artsy kid and started taking photos of friends in my high school. Around 1987 I got really into hip-hop and began shooting the kids that I met in clubs. I would hit up magazines, showing them my work, or look on the back of record sleeves, call the record companies and ask if I could meet somebody in the art department. So when hip-hop started blowing up, I happened to be blowing up at the same time. By the early 90s I was well known in the hip-hop community and getting work with magazines such as Vibe, which catered for that audience. Biggie, AKA the Notorious BIG, was on the radio – he was so hot that it seemed like every fifth song was him. I was a hot photographer so when Vibe asked me to shoot him and Faith Evans, it was a perfect match. They had not long been married and were hip-hop’s golden couple. I’d met Faith once before, when I photographed her for Interview magazine. She was from Newark, like I was. Vibe called me in and told me they wanted me to do something important or iconic. They showed me a book of the best album covers of all time, to demonstrate the classic look they wanted. Most of the cover shots were indoors, so I thought it would be good to get them outside. Biggie represented Brooklyn, so I thought it would be cool to shoot him underneath Brooklyn Bridge with the New York skyline behind. I picked up a Cadillac from a place that rented cars to the movies. I think it had been in A Bronx Tale. When the couple first arrived, they wanted some more clothes, so Puffy [Sean “Puff” Coombs AKA Puff Daddy, Bad Boy record label boss] took them shopping. Put a big dude like Biggie in a suit and he’s gonna look like the man, and he had a rugged public persona, but he was 23 when I shot him and in reality very boyish and endearing. He kept looking under the bridge and going: “Is this where they dump the dead bodies?” I took the photo on 120 Ektachrome film and used a mix of natural light and flash, so there are no shadows. For the photo they both gave me the sort of look you’d expect with them sitting in the back of that car, very connected with each other, but when she was in the car and he was outside it they were more playful. Faith Evans was starting to happen as well and they were in love. It was a really good time for them. Later on I took some shots of Biggie in the car at night on his own, which people now tell me look really eerie. There was one shot from the session of Biggie smiling, which the record company later used as the cover for a single. His mother said she loved that photo because she never usually saw him smiling. Vibe and everybody loved the Biggie and Faith photos, but the east coast/west coast hip-hop feud was happening and somebody told me that the west coast guys were pissed at me because they thought the photo was ripping off west coast car culture. A couple of years later The Face magazine were going to fly me to LA to shoot Biggie again, but told me they couldn’t pinpoint him to a location in LA because he was getting death threats. They said to wait until he could confirm somewhere. That’s when he got killed. Eric Johnson receives the first Abbey Road Studios Icon award on 14 May.

5/11/2022,"The International Olympic Committee has warned the Russian president of amateur boxing that it still has “significant concerns” over the governance, integrity of judges, and financial sustainability of the organisation he leads in a striking intervention that comes just days before he faces re-election. The letter, sent to the International Boxing Association (Iba) president, Umar Kremlev, who has in the past thanked Vladimir Putin for his backing, also questions the sport’s readiness for the Paris 2024 qualification cycle – and reminds Kremlev that boxing is not currently in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles because of its problems. The timing of the IOC’s letter, which was sent on Tuesday, is particularly noteworthy given that Kremlev’s hold on the sport is being challenged by his Dutch rival Boris van der Vorst in Istanbul on Friday. Kremlev is regarded as the favourite, although many are increasingly uneasy at having a Russian president following the invasion of Ukraine. The fact that Gazprom, the Russian majority state-owned energy company, provides most of the sport’s finances only increases those concerns. Last month Kremlev claimed that Iba had “built trust and confidence” with the IOC. However an unusually punchy letter from the IOC that has been seen by the Guardian cast doubt on the assertion. “At the outset, we must reiterate that the IOC’s recognition of the International Boxing Association remains suspended,” the letter states. “Boxing is not currently included in the sports programme of the Olympic Games Los Angeles 2028, with concerns remaining in the key areas of governance, financial sustainability and the proven integrity of the refereeing and judging systems.” The IOC’s letter also suggests Iba has not provided clear answers about its Paris 2024 qualification plans, to the detriment of the boxers. “Without these details they face challenges in finalising their planning of finances, schedules, logistics and, most importantly, training cycles,” the letter warns. “In addition, we would like to express our specific concern over the possible selection of events that may not provide fair eligibility criteria, and create possible discrimination.” The IOC withdrew recognition for Iba – then called Aiba – in June 2019 due to concerns over judging and refereeing, financial stability and governance. It followed a range of allegations of rigged decisions at the Rio 2016 Olympics and financial mismanagement under the previous president, CK Wu, who stepped down despite denying the allegations. In 2018 the Uzbek Gafur Rakhimov – who was described by the US treasury department as one of his country’s “leading criminals” and “an important person involved in the heroin trade”, allegations he denied – was then chosen to run the sport. Since being elected in 2020 Kremlev has positioned himself as a reformer and last year asked the Canadian law professor Richard McLaren to investigate historical judging and corruption cases in amateur boxing. However his rival in Friday’s election, Van der Vorst, told the Guardian that the reforms had been superficial and boxing needed to fundamentally change if it wanted to stay as an Olympic sport. “Boxing is still very much in danger,” he told the Guardian. “And a lot of national federations are concerned about the future. They fear that if there is no Olympic recognition for boxing, the sport will enter the dark ages. GB Boxing, for instance, has a high performance programme in Sheffield with a £11.5m budget. “There has to be an alternative for the current Russian leadership. It is not good for the image of our sport to still have sponsorship contracts with Gazprom, a Russian state-owned company. In fact it is very damaging.” Van der Vorst also questioned whether the McLaren investigation had led to fundamental change. “I am not aware of anyone who has been investigated and sanctioned based on the McLaren report,” he said. “At least there have not been any public announcements. “What I see is still the old culture, with people who shouldn’t be involved in Olympic boxing. We require a change of leadership.” Kremlev was one of three Russian presidents of the Olympic Federations before the invasion of Ukraine. Alisher Usmanov has since stepped aside as head of the International Fencing Federation after he was placed on a European Union sanctions list. However Vladimir Lisin remains president of the International Shooting Sport Federation.",Sport/Sport,"Olympic boxing at risk, IOC warns Iba chief amid fresh governance worries",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/11/olympic-boxing-at-risk-ioc-warns-iba-chief-amid-fresh-governance-worries
5/11/2022,"Rebekah Vardy has confirmed she attempted to leak a story about the arrest of drink-driving Premier League footballer Danny Drinkwater to a journalist at the Sun – but insisted it was a one-off. As part of the ongoing “Wagatha Christie” libel trial, the footballer’s wife said she sent the information on Drinkwater’s night in the cells to her agent Caroline Watt, along with a WhatsApp that said: “I want paying for this x”. When told the Sun had already got the story about the arrest from a source at the police station, Vardy said she was “fuming I didn’t give it to you earlier”. Watt replied to say “that would have been a fortune 😂” and instead suggested finding out where Drinkwater lived and sharing the information with paparazzi agency Splash News. Vardy told the high court that she does not systematically leak stories to the media and the idea of seeking payment from the Sun for the story was a “fleeting thought”. She said her real motivation in wanting to leak the story was to expose a drink driver to public scrutiny. Vardy is suing fellow footballer’s wife Coleen Rooney for libel, with the multimillion pound week-long trial underway at the high court. Rooney has publicly claimed that Vardy leaked three stories from a private Instagram account to the Sun newspaper, an allegation that Vardy says is false and defamatory. On the second day of the trial Rooney’s barrister, David Sherborne, continued to cross-examine Vardy, arguing that she regularly leaked private information to newspapers. Among other allegations, the court heard Vardy discussed a famous celebrity and suggested leaking “the story about her shagging”. Vardy told the court she was joking and would not have leaked it. Sherborne suggested this and other examples showed a pattern of behaviour, where Vardy passed tips to Watt who then dealt with journalists: “It’s not that you didn’t want to do the dirty, it’s that you didn’t want to be seen to be doing the dirty.” It was also claimed that Vardy leaked private information about her husband’s Leicester City teammate Riyad Mahrez to the media in 2018, potentially destabilising the Premier League team. At the time he was “on strike” and trying to force a move away from the football club. Vardy told her agent Caroline Watt: “Mahrez not turned up to training again, the lads are fuming.” Watt suggested contacting a Sky Sports reporter but Vardy said she was concerned: “I just don’t want it coming back on me.” Watt then said “I can tell someone” to which Vardy replied “Yes, do it”. Rooney’s lawyers claim that the exchange shows Vardy authorising her agent to leak the information about Mahrez and the feelings of Leicester City’s players to a journalist – and that the original source of the information could have been her husband Jamie. Reminded that she was under oath in the witness box, Vardy insisted she was certain a subsequent story about Mahrez did not come from her or Caroline Watt: “I was gossiping about things that were already in the public domain … It was an interesting story because it was pretty much unheard of that a player would not turn up.” Sherborne pressed Vardy on whether her husband Jamie was the source for the messages about Mahrez: “Did you or did you not know that the lads were fuming?” Vardy insisted she was just gossiping and did not have a source in the Leicester City changing room: “Jamie and I never discussed whether ‘the lads were fuming’”. Sherborne told the court that it was difficult to know for certain if Watt had sent messages to journalists because her phone – which he wished to search - had fallen over the side of a boat off the Scottish coast: “We will never know because her phone sits at the bottom of the North Sea.” Rooney sat on the front bench in the wood-panelled courtroom taking extensive notes as Vardy gave evidence. She was accompanied in court by her husband, the Derby County manager, Wayne Rooney. The court also heard that Vardy gave Watt access to her Instagram account, which both women then used to look at Rooney’s private locked posts. At one point Watt noticed that Rooney had briefly blocked Vardy. The agent asked Vardy: “Babe has Coleen unfollowed you?” Vardy replied: “Oh wow I just saw, wow, what a cunt. I’m going to message her.” The case continues.",News/UK news,‘Wagatha Christie’ case: Vardy says she tried to leak Drinkwater story to the Sun,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/vardy-drinkwater-drink-driving-story-wagatha-christie-rooney-libel-trial

In a statement, the FAA said two passengers were onboard the single-engine Cessna 208 when the pilot had a “possible medical issue”. One passenger steered the private plane smoothly into Palm Beach international airport. According to LiveATC.net audio, the passenger told air traffic control: “I’ve got a serious situation here. My pilot has gone incoherent and I have no idea how to fly the airplane.” Asked what the situation was with the pilot, the passenger said: “He is incoherent. He is out.” The air traffic controller asked the passenger what his position was. He replied: “I have no idea. I see the coast of Florida in front of me and I have no idea.” “Try to follow the coast either north or southbound,” the controller said. “We’re trying to locate you.” After four minutes, the passenger asked: “Have you guys located me?

5/11/2022,"Watford are close to appointing the Forest Green Rovers manager Rob Edwards as their next head coach. The League Two champions confirmed on Wednesday that Edwards had left and expressed disappointment that negotiations had been held “behind our backs”. Watford have identified Edwards, who guided Rovers to the title in his first season as a Football League manager, as an ideal successor to Roy Hodgson, who will leave at the end of this campaign. A young, homegrown coach would mark a significant change in the type of appointment Watford’s owners, the Pozzo family, have typically made and Edwards, if appointed, would become the club’s ninth permanent manager in five years. “Rob was a key part of the team that gained promotion to League One this season,” a Rovers statement said. “We’re disappointed that our support, loyalty and honesty towards Rob has been repaid in this way – with negotiations taking place behind our backs. We had no contact from Watford, from whom we might expect less, but in any event this kind of behaviour gives football a bad name. We thank Rob for all his work at FGR – forgive him the manner of his departure and wish him well.” Watford declined to comment.

5/11/2022,"Boris Johnson has promised to support Sweden and Finland against potential Russian threats in any way necessary as he travelled to both countries to sign mutual security agreements, with their governments mulling Nato membership in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. Holding a press conference with the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, on his first stop on a daylong trip, Johnson said the type and extent of possible support would largely be governed by what Sweden might ask for. “The declaration really makes it clear: it’s upon request of Sweden, the UK will of course provide assistance,” Johnson said in Harpsund, the country retreat of the Swedish prime minister. “What matters primarily is what Sweden decides to request.” Johnson had earlier signed mutual security agreements with Andersson. Later on Wednesday he was due to go to Finland to sign a parallel deal with the Finnish prime minister, Sauli Niinistö, and hold another press conference. A No 10 announcement said the deals “will see a step-change in defence and security cooperation between the UK and each country, intensifying intelligence sharing, accelerating joint military training, exercising and deployments, and bolstering security across all three countries and northern Europe”. It added: “They will also see the UK bolster its collaboration on traditional threats facing all three nations, while working also with Sweden and Finland to tackle new geopolitical challenges, such as hybrid and cyber threats.” While the wording is general, the impetus comes from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the subsequent decisions of Sweden and Finland to consider applying for Nato membership, and Russia’s threats of consequences if this happens. “The war in Ukraine is forcing us all to make difficult decisions,” Johnson said in brief opening remarks at the press conference. “But sovereign nations must be free to make those decisions without fear or influence or threat of retaliation.” Asked what the agreement might mean in practical terms, Johnson remained largely vague, but did not completely demur when asked if it could go as far as the UK providing assistance with nuclear weapons. “This is about our joint decision to show that we will support and defend each other,” he said. “When it comes to our nuclear deterrent, that’s something we don’t generally comment upon, but what I’ve made clear is that it’s up to either party to make a request, and we take it very seriously.” Johnson, who dodged questions on UK plans to potentially try to escape the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol, and his views on the Labour leader Keir Starmer’s pledge to resign if fined for breaching lockdown rules, said the deal was “the foundation stone” for closer links. “This declaration is something that is about the UK and Sweden standing together, affirming our friendship and our partnership, and our willingness to come to each other’s defence and support,” he said. Asked about Sweden’s decision over whether to apply to join Nato, Johnson said the UK would be supportive. “That’s not for me to comment upon except, of course, to say that I’m sure the UK will support whatever course of action Sweden decides to embark upon.”",News/Politics,UK pledges to back Sweden and Finland against Russian threats,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/11/uk-pledges-to-back-sweden-and-finland-against-russian-threats-nato
5/11/2022,"Even in the prologue, Trek to Yomi features more samurai cliches than you can chuck a katana at. Three levels of joyless brutality made me believe that this was going to be an exercise in gratuitous gore. Yet after a lot of monochromatic murder and speeches about duty, honour and bloodshed, it slowly morphs into something more compelling (though also hardly under-explored in Japanese cinema): a meditation on the inherent selfishness of vengeance. Sporting a try-hard, Kurosawa-inspired black and white aesthetic – complete with filmic grain – this game’s influences are less worn on its sleeve than embroidered into the entire kimono. Still, credit where credit’s due – solid Japanese voice talent helps this Polish/American collab feel more authentic. Trek to Yomi inevitably lives in the shadow of 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima, US studio Sucker Punch’s similarly reverent tribute to samurai cinema. Where Ghost breaks up the bloodshed with jovial jaunts chasing foxes across its open world or solving people’s problems, Yomi is a slash-happy side-scroller that doubles down on brutality, channelling the manga series Lone Wolf and Cub’s sadistic spirit. A disarmingly gentle introduction has you sprinting through a bustling feudal-era town, overhearing the grumbling townsfolk. Predictably, the peace doesn’t last. Protagonist Hiroki’s katana spills its first drop of blood around the 20-minute mark, and your blade’s thirst never seems to be quenched. Swordplay is more tactical and involved than it looks, letting you control the direction of slashes, combining parries with stance changes and light and heavy attacks. From testing your mettle against heavily armoured behemoths, to dispatching merceries under a hail of arrows, there’s just enough variety in duels to keep you slashing away and unlocking new blade skills to up the body count. Just as slaying samey bandits begins to lose its sheen, a fatal encounter sees a guilt-wracked, bloodstained Hiroki banished to Yomi – purgatory – where he slices his way through his literal demons. Leaving the generic feudal villages and terrified townsfolk behind, unsettling cries, warping environments and scuttling undead become the new normal, and that’s when this katana caper finds its footing. Yomi’s portrayal of consequences and remorse isn’t going to win awards for subtlety, but gives you a reason to see this journey through. A smattering of puzzles and the occasional chase scene offer some respite from slaughter. Taking the time to turn down branching paths rewards the player’s curiosity, too, whether that’s with crucial ammo for ranged weapons, hidden story collectibles, or coveted health and stamina upgrades. The checkpointing, however, has led to some of the most swear-inducing moments I’ve ever experienced in a game; their entirely inconsistent placement is baffling. Infuriatingly, after barely surviving multiple intense combat sections, there is often no save point, and you end up replaying the same skirmishes over and over. Other times they’re generously placed after a single, not even particularly challenging encounter. But despite its repetition and frustrations, I warmed to this grainy, gore-soaked journey after the tedious early hours. Thanks to a smattering of player choices, the game offers just enough of a hint at player agency to make you feel involved in the narrative, too, giving Trek to Yomi’s surrealist slaughter a sense of purpose. There’s a strong argument that a Japanese-made attempt at this genre would come closer to doing the samurai fantasy justice, but as with the many Japanese takes on virtual America, there’s a schlocky charm to Yomi’s tropey inauthenticity nonetheless.

5/11/2022,"Price rises slowed in the US in April but the annual inflation rate remained close to a 40-year high, leaving many Americans struggling to afford necessities including food, shelter and fuel. The latest consumer price index (CPI) figures – which measure a broad range of goods and services – showed prices rising by a monthly rate of 0.3% in April, down from 1.2% in March, the first fall since August 2021. But it is still too early to say whether inflation has peaked. At 8.3% the annual rate of inflation in April was down from 8.5% in March but remains at a level unseen since the 1980s. Over the year the CPI’s food index increased 9.4%, the largest 12-month increase since April 1981. The figures come as the Federal Reserve is moving to sharply increase interest rates in an attempt to bring prices back under control. The pace of rate rises, and fears that they may trigger a recession, have spooked investors and sent stock markets reeling. Soaring demand and a lack of supply thanks to the pandemic have led to price rises across a broad swathe of goods and services. A booming house market has made housing unaffordable for many Americans, especially people of color, and 49% of people recently told Pew Research that affordable housing is a large problem in their community. The rising cost of living has become a leading political issue as the US prepares for November’s midterm elections. Rising prices have battered Joe Biden’s approval ratings. This week an Investors Business Daily/TIPP poll found that Biden’s approval had fallen to 39%, approaching his previous record low of 38% set in February, and confidence in the US economy was close to an eight-year low. On Tuesday, Joe Biden said his administration was doing all it could to tackle inflation. “I want every American to know that I’m taking inflation very seriously,” he said in remarks from the White House. “It’s my top domestic priority.” “Families all across America are hurting because of inflation,” the president said. “I understand what it feels like. I come from a family where if the price of gas or food went up, we felt it.” The Biden administration has made attempts to bring down prices. In March the White House announced plans to release up to 1m barrels of oil a day from the strategic reserve, in an attempt to dampen high gasoline prices exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. But gas prices remain elevated at a national average of $4.37 a gallon compared with $2.96 a year ago, according to AAA. Republicans have blamed Biden’s stimulus programs for rising prices, a claim Biden disputes. ​​ The president said his policies had “helped not hurt” the nation’s economic outlook.",News/Business,US inflation rate slows but remains close to 40-year high,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-figures

5/11/2022,"It’s the end of the iPod era. The news that Apple is pulling the plug on the iPod Touch, and thus the entire 21-year-old line, is curiously timed for me because I only recently retired my iPod Classic. Every month for the past 30 years, I’ve made a compilation of my favourite songs. It’s a time capsule of musical memories. For the first decade I used cassettes to make my compilations. This required a lot of creative editing, tense retakes and hovering over the pause button like a predator. After that, the simple drag-and-drop of an iTunes playlist felt miraculous. Even once Spotify arrived, I kept this up for years as an act of commitment: love a song, buy a song, own a song. But for boring technical reasons, the computer that housed my music could no longer handle the iTunes store, so I had to download songs on one device, transport them to another and individually add them to the library, a process which was almost as laborious as making a tape. Reprogrammed by touchscreens, my fingers found the iPod’s click wheel increasingly alien. Why was I still doing this? I didn’t know. So I stopped. I never owned a Touch, so its demise doesn’t move me any more than that of the Nano and Shuffle five years ago. I did my sic transit gloria routine back in 2014, when my model, the iPod Classic (mine was 160gb), was discontinued. It is a sturdy little brick with just one job: music, and lots of it. I could listen to it non-stop for more than three months and never repeat a song. It is stolidly oblivious to the internet and its galaxy of distractions. It knows nothing of the cloud. The Touch, by contrast, always struck me as a glittery dilettante which didn’t carry nearly enough music, but it was still popular with people who wanted a specialist device with more memory and battery life than an iPhone, at a fraction of the price. Good for kids, too. Once smartphones got better and cheaper, and streaming destroyed downloads, the need for a separate music player evaporated. So it goes. Yet the iPod still has advantages over streaming, and not just the fact that it won’t pay a podcaster millions of dollars to talk nonsense about vaccines. Everybody has their own Spotify experience but we’re all drawing from the same pool of music, which is vast but limited. My iPod contains many songs that streaming does not acknowledge: forgotten B-sides culled from old CD singles, bootleg remixes plucked from filesharing platforms, sundry rarities downloaded from now defunct websites, albums snarled up in copyright issues, the catalogues of Spotify exiles Neil Young and Joni Mitchell. It is a unique collection of music, curated over many years, in which each song represents an active choice. It’s mine alone. Still, I’m well aware that I’m not the typical music consumer, and it would be hard to argue that the world’s most valuable company should continue to cater for collectors who simply must own the Chemical Brothers remix of Spiritualized or MIA’s debut mixtape. Like the turntable decades earlier, the iPod has gone from being a mass-market device for anyone who loves music to a niche product for the hardcore. Apple is not in the niche business. Now that the agile upstart has become a knackered warhorse, laden with nostalgia, it’s worth remembering that the iPod was contentious when it was launched back in October 2001, holding a then-remarkable 1,000 songs. What the author Stephen Witt calls “the most ubiquitous gadget in the history of stuff” did more for Apple – paving the way for the iPhone and iPad – than it did for the music industry. While the arrival of the iTunes store 18 months later helped to stem illegal filesharing, the iPod still allowed users to unbundle individual tracks from albums; download sales never came close to making up for collapsing CD revenue during the music business’s lost decade. I was initially grumpy about the iPod, complaining that it devalued music and drove a bulldozer through the concept of the album. A shuffle function? Barbarians! Eventually, of course, I bought one and loved it. As we now know, the album survived as an artistic entity. Whenever I read an article declaring the death of something, I’m pretty sure that it’s not really dead: vinyl made a comeback, and even clunky, fallible cassettes are enjoying a modest revival for reasons that I don’t entirely understand. Yet the iPod, as opposed to the broader concept of the digital music player, relies on one company, so it is as dead as something can be, devoured by the very revolution it launched. My own iPod sits on my desk, battery drained, silent as a paperweight, but I know that if I fire it up, I will have almost 20 years of my musical life in the palm of my hand. That’s me in there.

5/11/2022,"Italy’s defence minister has called for an investigation after more than 100 women reported being sexually harassed during an annual parade held by Italy’s elite mountain troops, the Alpini, last weekend. The women, many of whom were working in bars and restaurants, claimed they were groped, catcalled and verbally abused during the event in Rimini, which was attended by about 75,000 Alpini veterans and serving members. Non Una di Meno, a feminist alliance, said it had so far heard allegations of harassment from 150 women, some of whom have made formal complaints to the police. “There are numerous reports of harassment and catcalling by Alpine troops, mostly drunk, against women of all ages,” Non Una di Meno said in a statement. “Even more severe is the harassment suffered in the workplace by women who couldn’t respond in kind or escape this violence.” The accusations of harassment have sparked a political debate, with the defence minister, Lorenzo Guerini, describing them as “very serious”. “These episodes will certainly have to be investigated by the competent authorities. There must be zero tolerance. Harassment and violence must never, under any circumstances, be justified and must be condemned without hesitation,” he said. Established in 1872 to protect Italy’s northern borders, the Alpini is the oldest and most active mountain regiment in the world. Its troops are recognised by their distinctive green hats with raven feathers. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, said that while it was correct to condemn harassment if it had occurred, the “glorious Alpine corps” should not be singled out as a symbol of “violence and vulgarity”. “The Alpini have always been an example of generosity, sacrifice and respect,” he added. “If someone has made a mistake, then it is right that he should pay. But hands off the history and future of the Alpine troops.” The Alpini National Association, which organises the annual gathering, condemned the “reported uncivilised behaviour” but said problems were only to be expected during events that attracted huge crowds, and that anyone could buy a fake Alpini hat to infiltrate the crowd and exploit the occasion as “a sort of Oktoberfest”. Elly Schlein, the vice-president of the Emilia-Romagna region, said the reports needed to be taken seriously. She said: “These aren’t just episodes of bad manners or drunkenness, there are episodes of harassment.” Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, said light needed to be shed on what happened, and those who “sullied the uniform they wear” needed to be be swiftly punished, but “criminalising all Alpini is unacceptable”.",News/World news,Italy’s elite mountain troops face inquiry over harassment claims,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/italy-alpini-elite-mountain-troops-face-inquiry-harassment-claims
