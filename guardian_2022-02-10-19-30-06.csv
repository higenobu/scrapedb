2/10/2022,"The number of people in England waiting to start routine hospital treatment has risen to a record high. At the end of December 2021, 6.1 million people were waiting to start treatment, NHS England said. This is the highest number since records began in August 2007.  The number of people having to wait more than 52 weeks to start treatment stood at 310,813 in December 2021, up from 306,996 in the previous month and 39% higher than the number in December 2020. The figures come two days after NHS England published its elective recovery plan, setting out how it hopes to cut waiting times, by expanding its capacity through the use of community diagnostic centres where people can have tests such as scans and X-rays and surgical hubs, which carry out large numbers of the same type of operation, such as joint replacements. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, told MPs that the NHS plans to treat everyone who has been waiting for surgery for more than two years by July and eradicate 18-month waits by April 2023, 65-week waits by March 2024, and one-year waits by March 2025. But the waiting list would keep on growing until March 2024, he added, because up to 10 million people who did not seek medical help during the pandemic are doing so in greater numbers, which is increasing the demand for NHS care. There is growing unease in Downing Street and among Conservative MPs that stubbornly high waiting lists could prove a problem in the run-up to the next election, which is due in May 2024. Ministers have been given estimates that the headline total of the waiting list could reach as much as 10.7 million people, or 9.2 million under the best case scenario, by spring 2024. The Guardian disclosed earlier this week that in the first seven months of 2021-22, 290,428 people in England with possible symptoms of cancer did not get to see a specialist within the 14 days after being referred by a GP that the NHS seeks to guarantee, and the total could hit almost 500,000 – more than double the previous biggest annual tally of 235,549 – by the end of March.",News/Society,Number of people in England on NHS waiting list hits record high,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/10/number-of-people-in-england-on-nhs-waiting-list-hits-record-high
2/10/2022,"The International Olympic Committee has refused to comment on whether the athlete at the centre of a doping controversy at Beijing 2022 is the 15-year-old Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva, despite the teenager being named in multiple reports around the world. Multiple sources have told the Guardian that Valieva, who captured the world’s attention when she became the first female skater to perform a quad at the Olympics, may be the athlete who tested positive for trimetazidine, a metabolic agent that helps prevent angina attacks. There has been no official confirmation that Valieva is the subject of the positive test and alongside the IOC, the Russian Olympic Committee and the International Skating Union are also refusing to confirm or deny if it was her.  Sources have suggested the test happened several weeks ago, raising questions about why it emerged only after the Russians won their figure skating team gold medal on Monday. The Guardian understands that Valieva’s case is being heard at an emergency hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Beijing. If the speculation is correct, and it is Valieva who tested positive, then the Russian Olympic Committee will lose their team gold and she will not be able to compete at the individual event next week. Valieva continued to train in Beijing on Thursday, but did not talk to the world’s media. However her training partner, Anastasia Gubanova, a Russian-born skater who represents Georgia, told reporters: “It would be very unfortunate for her if something bad happens because of this.” A Russian skating official refused to comment when asked by the Guardian about Valieva’s case. The three Russian skaters in the men’s figure skating final also took a similar approach. The medal ceremony for the figure skating team event was due to be held on Tuesday evening local time but was delayed with the IOC saying it was due to “legal consultation.” When repeatedly asked about the reports naming Valieva on Thursday, the International Committee spokesperson Mark Adams said it would be wrong to comment on an ongoing case. “I’m not going to comment on all sorts of speculation that I have also seen,” he said at the IOC’s daily press conference in Beijing. “We had a situation arise on Wednesday at short notice that has legal implications. I’m not going to comment on a legal case because it wouldn’t be appropriate.” However the chair of the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee board of directors, has warned the IOC that the future of the Games depends on them upholding the integrity of sport. “Clearly what’s on my mind today is it is so important to the athletes of the world that the values of this Movement be upheld, and one of the most important values is integrity of sport,” said Susanne Lyons. Lyons said World Anti-Doping Agency rules must not only be observed, “but that when something does go wrong that the sanctions are even-handed across the world – that they are all treated fairly. “The whole credibility of the Olympic Movement and the Paralympic Movement stands teetering on the edge of us saying that we really believe and live the values that we say we stand for,” she added. The United States finished in silver medal position behind the Russian Olympic Committee team in Monday’s team finale with Japan taking bronze and Canada in fourth. Meanwhile a statement from the International Skating Union said it could not disclose any information about any possible Anti-Doping rule violation involving a skater. “This is in line with the ISU Anti-Doping Rules and IOC Anti-Doping Rules for Beijing 2022,” it added. Russia was banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang after an investigation ruled there had been state sponsored doping on a huge scale when it hosted the 2014 Games in Sochi. However it was allowed by the IOC to send a 168-strong team under the name Olympic Athlete from Russia. In December 2019 Russia got in further trouble when the fact they had deliberately manipulated thousands of doping records at a Moscow laboratory was confirmed. As a result it has to compete at these Games as the Russian Olympic Committee.",Sport/Sport,Kamila Valieva: IOC refuses to confirm if teen skater is at centre of doping controversy,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/10/kamila-valieva-ioc-refuses-to-confirm-if-teen-skater-is-at-centre-of-doping-controversy-russia-beijing-winter-olympics
2/10/2022,"On Tuesday, Scott Morrison warned his colleagues disunity was political death. He told colleagues in the party room: “I’m going to lead, and I’m asking you once again to follow me to an election victory.” Just before dawn on Thursday morning, five Liberals ignored the prime minister’s exhortation, and crossed the floor in the House of Representatives. The rebellion was bigger than senior figures had anticipated.  The news in the other chamber was no better. As the sun rose, it seemed certain the government would not have the numbers to push its religious discrimination legislation through the Senate. The Liberal senator Andrew Bragg also intended to cross the floor. But free-range moderates were not the prime minister’s only problem. Morrison was also facing a boilover on the right. The Australian Christian Lobby was so displeased about events overnight it called for the legislation to be pulled. The ACL’s reverse ferret imperative was promptly echoed by the veteran conservative Eric Abetz. Conservatives, beyond furious with the moderates, were now baying for blood. Without a course correction, and pronto, there was going to be an explosion. Bear in mind religious discrimination was supposed to be Morrison’s signature reform; the pinnacle of his prime ministership. It was also supposed to be a potent political wedge against Labor in the outer suburban contests that will ultimately determine the next government of Australia. But given the insurrection – the public vote of no-confidence by inner-city Liberals in a divisive package that failed to protect vulnerable kids – Morrison’s ability to weaponise religious discrimination in the coming election would be diminished. So things were bad. By the time weary MPs lined up in the coffee queue at Parliament House, the government was in full strategic retreat. The bill disappeared from the Senate list. Journalists were briefed that amendments moved by the independent Rebekah Sharkie and passed in the House of Representatives were problematic, according to legal advice. There could be “unintended consequences”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The attorney general, Michaelia Cash, wrote to the crossbencher making this contention. The letter was released to the media before Sharkie had time to read it. In the letter, Cash told Sharkie “concerns ha[d] been raised”. It was not clear, at least in the correspondence, by whom. Sharkie was clearly sceptical, given she’d lived through a previous iteration of “unintended consequences” with the medevac legislation. Back then, the government said it had legal advice highlighting problems, but when a redacted version of that legal advice was later released under freedom of information, it wasn’t entirely as advertised. Sharkie made it clear Cash had not shown her any legal advice. If it was shared, she would consider it very carefully. But the crossbencher insisted the amendments the Liberals had supported on the floor of the House were “sound”. Things were going to get worse for Morrison. After question time, the Ten Network political editor, Peter van Onselen, had a rare cabinet leak. On Monday night, when the cabinet met, the prime minister had floated an idea. He would put the government’s shelved national integrity commission bill back on the notice paper for debate. This gesture would hopefully keep the moderates in the tent for the looming religious discrimination votes – Tasmanian Liberal Bridget Archer in particular. Perhaps some crossbenchers likely to cause trouble on religious discrimination could also be mollified.

Van Onselen’s story painted a very grim picture. Here was a prime minister in the dying weeks of parliament willing to horse trade protections for vulnerable children with the resolution of an integrity commission – and being rolled in the process. I’m confident some version of this conversation certainly happened on Monday night. But some counsel the dialogue wasn’t exactly as depicted. The more benign version says Monday night was a strategy session with Morrison wondering out loud whether or not there was a universe where the government could kill two birds with one stone – get religious discrimination and the integrity commission through the parliament – rather than some high-octane, hideously transactional, roll of the dice. Some also contend the prime minister can’t have been rolled on Monday night because there was no firm landing point. No decision, because events were too fluid. There are always nuances. But whatever the nuances, fact is the confidential conversation leaked, and it leaked on the day where Morrison had to kick his religious discrimination package into the long grass. This felt like a direct hit. An absolute bullseye. But as direct hits go, this one is passing strange. These things are clear. The Morrison government, five minutes from an election, is tired and ragged. Relations between moderates and conservatives are strained to breaking point. Unresolved factional poison in New South Wales has disrupted the equilibrium in Canberra. The rolling tumult of the past fortnight also tells us someone, or more than someone, wants to cause a ruckus. Someone clearly wants to cause Morrison some capital “T” trouble. But the endgame of this capital “T” trouble is entirely unclear. If Liberals are planning to roll the prime minister before the election, with the predictable precursor to regicide being random acts of violence – a steady drip feed of leaks, and back biting and free character assassinations – it’s not clear who Morrison’s challenger is. People close to Peter Dutton swear black and blue that the Queenslander is not moving this side of the poll. Colleagues also insist that it is not in Josh Frydenberg’s interests to move on Morrison three months out from an election contest he could easily lose. Why would the next big thing render himself yesterday’s man? It has been obvious to anyone watching politics that Dutton and Frydenberg are positioning for an inevitable leadership succession face-off post-election. But there’s no evidence either man has an army marshalling covertly on a beach. So this is a spiral, no doubt. But it’s a deeply surreal plunge.",News/Australia news,It began with a pre-dawn insurrection on religious discrimination and it got worse for Scott Morrison | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/it-began-with-a-pre-dawn-insurrection-on-religious-discrimination-and-it-got-worse-for-scott-morrison
2/10/2022,"Leaked training documents from Target, one of the largest retailers in the US, reveal how the company is directing management at stores to prevent workers from organizing unions. At the end of January 2022, Target emailed store management new training guidelines on labor relations to complete, prompting managers to look for warning signs of worker and labor union organizing within their stores and coordinate with corporate human resources to quell union organizing campaigns.  The training email and documents were leaked anonymously to the workers’ advocacy group, Target Workers Unite, and come as other large US chains including Amazon and Starbucks are fighting unionization plans. “This training will help you understand Target’s philosophy on unions and how unions could impact our Brand and our team,” states an introduction slide to the training. The training goes on to characterize unions as “a business that makes money from the dues and fees paid by its members”, but then explains a union is formed when employees come together and express the desire to have a union represent them, typically through an election process. Target warns a union could reduce flexibility and narrow job descriptions, increase operational costs, and create conflict between managers and employees. The company emphasizes preferring working directly with its workers over directly negotiating with workers represented by a union. “We don’t believe that a union or any other third-party representative would improve anything-not for our team members, our guests, or the company,” states the training. Target also claims in the training the company isn’t “anti-union” but rather “pro team member and guest”. Managers are informed during the training that their critical role in leadership is to create an environment where workers don’t feel the need to organize a union, and provides managers with training on how to determine and intervene in any behavior of workers that signals dissatisfaction with working conditions and flags potential warning signs of union organizing. Some examples included small gatherings of workers, the emergence of employees as leaders in vocalizing concerns, seeing workers meet with recently terminated workers, and work-related conversations among employees regarding issues such as pay, benefits, job security, or other grievances. The training also flagged “unusual activities”, such as union flyers distributed in store parking lots or missing corporate documents such as schedules or payroll rosters. “Early detection and response to the signs of organizing is vital in maintaining a union-free environment,” states the training. The training includes a question and answer section on different theoretical scenarios prompting managers to take actions in response to union organizing signs, such as surveilling workers’ participation on worker-related blogs or pages on social media, and notifying human resources for guidance on proper action. Adam Ryan, an organizer with Target Workers Unite and an employee at Target in Christiansburg, Virginia, said the training documents were leaked from his store shortly after his flyers to promote a local event presentation on Black labor in Richmond, Virginia, for Black History Month co-hosted by Target Workers Unite, were removed from the break room. “I confronted HR about it. We still have a standing settlement from the NLRB [National Labor Relations Board] in 2018 and taking down the flyer was in violation of that settlement. I argued with them that the no solicitation policies would be true but they didn’t consistently enforce those policies,” said Ryan. He claimed the bulletin board at the time included non-work related content such as a memorial for Betty White and new baby pictures from employees and that managers began questioning employees one-on-one shortly after the incident on work-related issues, as the labor relations training directed. Ryan is currently involved in a union card authorization drive at his store location in an attempt to garner enough support from his coworkers to form a union that Target must directly negotiate a contract with. “If you look at the training, they try to say they’re not anti-union, that they’re pro guests and pro team members, but they wouldn’t be having these training forced on management at our stories if they weren’t actually trying to union bust and prevent us from exercising our rights,” said Ryan. “Target is no better than any other company out there. They talk a big game, they say they’re this very progressive company that cares about their workers, but then when workers start exercising their rights, they respond just like any other company that doesn’t want a union coming in.” Andrew Stacy, a Target employee in Indianapolis, Indiana, for over two years who is also trying to organize his coworkers to form a union, experienced similar issues, which he has since filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board over. In December 2021, Stacy explained he was distributing union flyers with a coworker and a manager confiscated and removed the flyers, then interrogated his coworker about it. The labor relations training, Stacy argued, undermined the company’s claims of being pro-worker. “It just shows how little Target thinks of us, that we don’t know what we want and they know what’s best for us,” Stacy said. “This union-busting training, that unions are a business is 100% untrue. We’re the union. Unions are the workers and what I’m organizing in my store is a rank and file effort.”",News/US news,Target directing store managers to prevent workers from unionizing,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/10/target-directs-managers-prevent-workers-from-unionizing
2/10/2022,"When I was 28 years old, the first of my university friends gave birth. We marvelled over her baby, but her tone changed when I started to talk about my future because, well, “Was I planning …?” and: “Wasn’t I thinking about …?” and: “Didn’t I want to have children?” Until that moment, I had not asked myself the question. I thought it was no longer something that had to be asked, or answered; this was the 00s, not the 50s. Women no longer ran their lives by the internalised tick-list of husband, house and baby. But in the following decade, the world began to look and sound as if it was full of timeless, retrograde anxieties and paranoias over fertility windows and body clocks.  The myth of motherhood runs deep, and the lie that, secretly, all women want children is still so potent that it felt like biological gaslighting. Why did I not feel this elemental hunger? Was there something wrong with me? And finally, what was wrong with me? I went to my mother, who had never hidden the fact that she regarded motherhood as a burden. I told her I was thinking about adoption because it was least preoccupied with DNA and bloodlines and my beautiful baby, born of my womb. To my surprise, she liked the idea and started talking about the tradition among some Pakistani women to pledge their next pregnancy to a family member. As an unborn baby, she had been promised to a cousin who was desperate for a child, until my grandmother changed her mind. For a while, we hatched the plan to adopt a girl and raise her between us in our own mini matriarchy. It never happened, but if I were to become a mother in a second life, this is how I envisage it happening. As I got older, I began meeting men and women, some with partners, some without, some gay, some straight, who had either not wanted kids or just not had them. The tyrannical tick-list of husband, house and baby, in that order, became just what it was: a capitalism of the body and mind that packaged up maternal instinct and sold it back to me. Now, as a 49-year-old, I have not experienced biological motherhood, but I have felt connected to my womb and its cyclical ebbs and swellings. It is a reminder that my body is not a static entity but a transforming thing, multitudinous in its possibilities. I have also seen the physicality of motherhood through friends and family. Pregnancy and childbirth is wondrous in what it achieves. That I have not experienced it is of no loss to me; I have experienced other wonders. Just like the universalising of fear around the biological clock that I was confronted with more than a decade ago, there is an apocalyptic ring to many of the stories I hear of menopause now, as my body creeps closer to the prospect of brain fog and hot flushes. I hear of all the ways it needs to be controlled and medicalised. Once again, my ovaries and uterus are sites of anxiety and fear. I discuss this with a British Pakistani friend and tell her how a menopausal woman in my spinning class said she would get so hot in restaurants that she would begin tearing off her clothes in heated delirium. “She should try coming to Karachi for the afternoon,” said my friend, half in jest, but it pointed to a bigger truth – there is not one definitive experience of menopause – perhaps we embody what we are taught to expect, culturally. I still do not know how to answer the questions my friend asked me at the age of 28. It is the framing that is the problem. I have not become a mother just as I have not become an acrobat or a brain surgeon. It might have been one kind of life and this is another: meaningful, rewarding, joyous.

2/10/2022,"A Republican candidate for governor in Georgia has said he would not let “any of the left” run elections in his state, adding repeatedly that it would happen “over my dead body” and underscoring the violent tone that has come to shape discourse around democracy in America. Former Senator David Perdue railed against his Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, in a video of a speech given 4 February in Fayette county. Abrams, a voting rights activist, would be the first Black governor in the state’s history if elected.  Perdue, who has been endorsed by Donald Trump, told his supporters: “My vision for Georgia is this: over my dead body would I ever, ever turn an election process over to Stacey Abrams or any of that woke mob ever again.” At another campaign event in Alpharetta, Georgia, Perdue repeated the “over my dead body” line,saying: “Over my dead body will we ever turn over an election to any of the left that we saw happening in 2020.” The Purdue campaign did not respond to a Guardian request for comment. The Georgia governor’s race is among the most closely-watched elections this year and a likely key battleground in the upcoming 2024 election. It played a vital role in president Joe Biden’s 2020 victory as he flipped the state, and it was also crucial to winning Democratic control of the senate when the party won two run-off elections there. That outsized role has seen Georgia become a ground zero for the national fight over voting rights and for Republicans’ baseless claims that the state’s election process was somehow fraudulent. It has also sparked a fierce fight for the office of the secretary of state, which helps run Georgia’s elections. The seat is currently held by Republican Brad Raffensperger. Perdue is one of 51 election deniers running for governor in 24 states, according to tracking by The States United Democracy Center, a nonpartisan organization that monitors elections. Perdue lost his senate seat in a runoff to Democrat John Ossoff last January. Now Perdue is running in the Republican primary against incumbent Republican governor Brian Kemp, who earned Trump’s ire after certifying Georgia’s election results, a process he was legally bound to uphold as governor. Perdue has earned Trump’s endorsement by espousing fierce loyalty and echoing the former president’s baseless claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. In December Perdue went further and told Axios he wouldn’t have certified the state’s 2020 election results if he had been governor at the time. The same month, Perdue joined a lawsuit in Fulton County, Georgia, reviving unfounded allegations of voter fraud and seeking to review absentee ballots that he claimed would prove Trump won the 2020 election. Several recounts of the presidential vote affirmed Biden’s victory in Georgia. Raffensperger had also resisted pressure by Trump in an hour-long phone call in 2020 to “find” enough votes to overturn the election. Trump has now endorsed Raffensperger’s Republican opponent for secretary of state. Perdue is promising voters that if elected he’ll create “an election law enforcement division of the Georgia bureau of investigation”, the state’s criminal investigation agency, to ensure that only legal votes are counted. Trump falsely claimed 5,000 dead people voted in 2020 in Georgia, but a state review found only four cases of dead people voting. Perdue is already outlining how he would change the way elections are certified if he was elected. “I believe that before you can certify an election, whether it’s a president or a US senator, or a statewide basis, you have to have an outside third-party entity audit the results. Not the secretary of state,” Perdue told voters in Fayette, adding that he believed allowing the secretary of state to certify and audit elections was “sort of like you grading your own homework.” Perdue’s use of violent rhetoric comes on the heels of an unprecedented campaign of intimidation against election officials. A Reuters investigation found over 100 threats of death or violence to U.S. election workers. It also comes as the Republican party increasingly embraces Trump’s “big lie” of a fraudulent election. In a recent poll only 21% of Republicans said they believed Joe Biden’s election was “legitimate”.Last week the RNC voted to declare the January 6 attack “legitimate political discourse’ and censured Republican representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for participating in the House’s investigation into the attack.",News/US news,Trump ally vows to block ‘the left’ from overseeing key Georgia elections,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/10/david-perdue-georgia-governor-senate-election-stacey-abrams
2/10/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been hit with a damaging cabinet leak revealing he was rolled over a plan to convince renegade MPs opposed to the government’s religious discrimination bill. After a torrid start to the parliamentary year, which saw Morrison’s character come under question after the leaking of a damaging text message, the prime minister has spent the week attempting to corral MPs into supporting the religious discrimination bill.  In a story published late on Thursday, The Australian reported Morrison had been rolled in a cabinet meeting on Monday over a proposal to try to win over moderate MPs by introducing a beefed-up version of the government’s integrity commission bill. Sources have confirmed to Guardian Australia that a discussion on such a proposal took place. The leak comes at a precarious time for Morrison, who is urging unity among MPs as the government lags behind in the polls and as voters express growing dissatisfaction with the prime minister’s performance over summer. While supporters of both Peter Dutton and Josh Frydenberg downplayed suggestions of leadership strife, the airing of the cabinet discussion in which Morrison’s proposal was overruled is likely to fuel instability ahead of next week’s parliamentary sitting. It will be the last sitting of the House of Representatives before the budget in March, after which Morrison is expected to call an election for May. In a joint partyroom meeting on Tuesday, Morrison appealed to Coalition MPs to “come together” in the lead-up to the election, emphasising the importance of a unity of purpose. “I’m going to lead, and I’m asking you once again to follow me to an election victory,” Morrison said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But the call for unity was followed by an immediate display of division, after five moderate MPs defied Morrison’s plea and crossed the floor to support amendments to put in place protections for LGBTQ students. This sparked a backlash from conservative MPs and the Christian lobby, prompting Morrison to shelve the bill. Morrison is now unlikely to be able to deliver on the promise of legislating on religious discrimination or a commonwealth integrity commission before the next election.

The defence minister, Peter Dutton, went further, sparking uproar in the House of Representatives by saying the Chinese government had “made a decision about who they will back in the next federal election”. “We now see evidence, Mr Speaker, that the Chinese Communist party, the Chinese government, has also made a decision about who they’re going to back in the next federal election, Mr Speaker, and that is open and that is obvious, and they have picked this bloke as that candidate,” Dutton said. The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, said any suggestion of treason, sedition or anything against the national security of this nation “has been dealt with by Speakers in the strictest terms”. But in remarks that were condemned by Labor, Dutton suggested that his comments were based on “what has been publicly reported and commented on by the director general of Asio”, pointing to remarks made on Thursday by the Asio boss, Mike Burgess, about the risk of foreign interference at the upcoming election. “I have not made any allegations against the leader of the opposition,” Dutton said. “Mine is a reflection on the Chinese government, the actions of the Chinese government, and that is the context in which I made the comment, and it is perfectly in order. It might be uncomfortable for those opposite but it is perfectly in order.” The combative senior conservative also suggested Albanese was “unprepared” to become prime minister, comparing him to the former Labor leader Mark Latham. Speaking after question time, Albanese asked the Speaker of the House, Andrew Wallace, to examine the Hansard record of Dutton’s remarks and report back to the parliament, saying the reflections on his approach to national security were of a “very serious nature”. “I take that very seriously and the idea that that should be the subject of partisanship and partisan domestic debate at a time of international uncertainty is just not acceptable and not in Australia’s national interest,” he said. He asked that Wallace seek a briefing from Burgess, criticising Dutton for bringing into parliament the “purported view” of the Asio director. “To bring in someone from outside who is well respected, who has a job in our national security infrastructure and to attempt to use them in a partisan way is a very serious matter indeed,” Albanese said.",News/Australia news,Fresh leak reveals Scott Morrison rolled in cabinet over plan to win back renegade MPs,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/fresh-leak-reveals-scott-morrison-rolled-in-cabinet-over-plan-to-win-back-renegade-mps
2/10/2022,"From Wings of Desire to Run Lola Run, from Cate Shortland’s Berlin Syndrome to one-take wonder Victoria, quite a few film-makers have been seduced by the liberating possibilities of the German capital. But too much freedom can often equate to directionless freestyling – and the authority-resistant, hard-partying, gender-fluid spirit of Berlin goes straight to the head of Irish writer-director Samuel Kay Forrest in this rambling and cringingly earnest feature debut. Forrest plays wandering soul Angus, a twentysomething with a side-shave haircut and a thorny family background set on finding himself in the capital of Euro-hedonism. When he’s not railing against fascism and scarpering from the polizei, or oh-so-seditiously spray-painting his tag “HipBeat” around town, he has a budding relationship with local woman Angie (Marie Céline Yildirim). She’s unaware, though, that he’s sleeping around with members of both sexes – and, after a pep talk with an inspirational drag queen, becoming more intent on exploring the parts of himself in between.  For a film about searching and transition, too much of this identity crisis is baldly spelled out through voiceover, with Angus’s interior monologue prone to such zingers as: “We’ve all got scars. Yeah – I’ve got a few.” Only once does Forrest, rather than the obvious approach, grapple in properly dramatised form with gender and sexuality: during a 13-minute, single-cut scene in which Angus nervously reveals his new incarnation to Angie. It’s a bold gambit; though over-elongated, this vignette engages far more plausibly with the issues of judgment and acceptance. Most of the time, though, HipBeat can’t rouse itself to be much more than a mood piece – even as it nominally counts down to a climactic Kreuzberg street protest. Despite the added charge from these scenes being shot in real life, its political ideas are stuck in an embarrassing studenty register: “I feel a beat in the street as I look at the city. A change is coming.” It’s on firmer ground – backed up by Joshua Monroe’s attuned urban cinematography and a choice outing for Mr Flagio’s Italo-disco classic Take a Chance – when arguing how change is ultimately rooted in a personal revolution.

Truss arrived in Moscow this week as part of a British diplomatic effort to head off a potential Russian offensive in Ukraine. In her opening remarks, Truss warned Lavrov about the devastating impact a war would have.  “Minister Lavrov, I’m here on diplomats’ day to urge Russia to take the path of diplomacy,” said Truss, referring to the Russian professional holiday for diplomats. “A war in Ukraine would be disastrous for the Russian and Ukrainian people and for European security.” The UK has warned of a severe response if Russia launches an attack on Ukraine. The government is currently reviewing new sanctions legislation before putting it to parliament. “Russia must respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as Russia freely signed up to do in the 1994 Budapest memorandum,” Truss told Lavrov. “If these principles are respected, I believe that in today’s talks, we can make progress to strengthen security for all.’ The trip is part of a blitz of British diplomacy with Russia as the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is scheduled to travel to Moscow for consultations with the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, on Friday. Yet expectations for both meetings are limited as Russia has put forward maximalist demands to Nato to remove its troops from member states and to pledge never to accept Ukraine into the alliance. In his remarks, Lavrov said that British-Russian relations had reached their “lowest point in years” and warned that Russia would not be cowed by western threats. “As for the ultimatums and threats, this is a dead end and will yield nothing,” Lavrov said. “Unfortunately some of our western colleagues are carried away by this in their public statements and I can’t call this diplomacy.” “If our British colleagues actually [want to improve relations],” Lavrov added, “we will naturally reciprocate, as we are dissatisfied with relations that have reached what seems to be their lowest point in recent years.” Other western leaders and officials have made attempts to get through to the Kremlin in recent weeks. Emmanuel Macron this week spent five hours in talks with Vladimir Putin before travelling to Kyiv on Tuesday to meet the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is expected in Moscow next week. Truss and Lavrov met at the mansion of the Russian ministry of foreign affairs on Spiridonovka Street. Truss said that earlier she had visited Moscow State University to meet young mathematicians and other academics.",News/Politics,"Russia must respect Ukraine’s sovereignty, says Truss as talks open",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/10/russia-must-respect-ukraine-sovereignty-liz-truss-talks-open
2/10/2022,"Huge numbers of refugees could be forced to flee Ukraine for other eastern European countries if Russian troops invade, the UK’s defence secretary has warned, as he admitted that military tensions were still moving the “wrong way”. Ben Wallace said it would be a “lose-lose” scenario if Moscow directed its soldiers stationed along Ukraine’s borders with Russia and Belarus to attack.  A trio of warnings was issued by senior UK government figures on Thursday, with Wallace suggesting a sanctions package against Russian leaders was being finalised to apply if there was an incursion into Ukraine, while Boris Johnson headed to Brussels and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, was in Moscow. Half of all Russia’s combat troops had so far been deployed to the Ukrainian border, Wallace said, adding that the country was also “planning to start a nuclear strategic exercise soon”. “Despite the talking, the direction of travel is in the wrong way,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.   Russia  Army: 280,000, including 2,840 tanks and 6,920 fighting vehicles; 150 Iskander ballistic missiles; 4,684+ artillery; 1,520 surface-to-air batteries.  Navy (just the Black Sea fleet): 6 submarines; 6 warships; 35 patrol ships.  Air force: 1,160 combat planes, 394 attack helicopters, 714 air defence systems. Ukraine Army: 145,000, including 858 tanks and 1,184 fighting vehicles; 90 Tochka ballistic missiles; 1,818 artillery; 75+ surface-to-air batteries.  Navy: 1 warship, 12 patrol and coastal ships.  Air force: 125 combat planes, 35 attack helicopters; 6 medium TB2 drones; 322 air defence systems.  Source: International Institute of Strategic Studies Wallace said UK defence chiefs expected moves from the “Russian playbook” that would give a “pretext for an invasion or some other activity”, such as a false flag operation whereby responsibility for an act is wrongly attributed. Cyber-attacks and further stoking of political division could also be used to fan the flames and increase the chances of war, he added. Wallace said other eastern European countries such as Poland and Romania would “feel the heat” of an invasion of Ukraine. “I think we can expect very large movements of people as refugees,” he said. “And that in itself can be very destabilising to small and medium-sized states.” After it was announced that 1,000 British troops would be deployed to Nato countries to provide support in case of a Russian invasion, Wallace said they would be able to help with any “humanitarian crisis”. “Soldiers are able to deal with that and provide force multiplier to the allies that are on the frontline,” he told BBC Breakfast. “There is a cost, there’s a human cost. Russia will remember as the Soviet Union the human cost of Afghanistan. It will remember the human cost of the likes of the Chechnya wars. “Just like Britain reflects on the cost of Afghanistan and Iraq and all those conflicts we are involved in.” After Truss’s plan to put the UK’s “toughest sanctions regime against Russia” on the statute book in time for her trip to Russia fell through, Wallace insisted they were almost ready to present to parliament. He said: “Energy supplies is one area to target; financial institutions is another one. And … individuals. It is important that the people in that regime or in the government feel the cost of their actions as well.” In her meeting with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, Truss said a war in Ukraine would be “disastrous” and would “have massive consequences and carry severe costs”. Meanwhile, Johnson is heading overseas as parliament prepares to go into recess. He will meet Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, in Brussels, before travelling to Poland for meetings with the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, and President Andrzej Duda.",News/World news,"Russia and Ukraine crisis moving ‘wrong way’, says UK defence secretary",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/russia-ukraine-military-tensions-moving-wrong-way-says-ben-wallace-uk-defence-chief
2/10/2022,"Ever since the monochromatic thrills of 1996’s Pokémon Red and Blue, I’ve dreamed of embarking on a sprawling 3D Pokémon adventure. While 2019’s Sword and Shield did their best to belatedly bring the series’ love-worn formula in to the third dimension, a lack of real innovation left the franchise’s legions of older fans despairing over their Pikachu plushies. More than two years later, the ambitious Pokémon Legends: Arceus sees creators Game Freak attempting to really modernise the series. Dispatched on a time-travelling mission by none other than Pokémon God, Arceus, Legends begins with your adolescent avatar plummeting through a portal to the past. Mercifully, the titular divinity isn’t completely unreasonable – you’re at least sent on your way with a fully charged smartphone. Cheers, your holiness. As calming flute melodies float around your ears and dramatic feudal-Japanese fonts fill the screen, it’s hard not to be swept up in the novelty of it all. At least until you take a closer look at your surroundings.  While the Nintendo Switch may not be a technical powerhouse, the little handheld that could has delivered a slew of sprawling spectacles, from gamechanging launch title Breath of the Wild to niche role-playing game Xenoblade Chronicles 2. It has consistently punched above the weight of its spindly specs. Bafflingly though, Pokémon Legends looks like complete arse(eus). While the colourful creatures move and react more convincingly than ever, the world around them is jarringly sparse, with blurry rock textures and large landscapes lined with anaemic-looking Christmas trees. Visually, it’s hard not to feel a little short-changed. Still, beauty is more than skin deep. Thankfully, Pokémon Legends: Arceus has one hell of a personality. A few hours in I begun to warm to its charms. It quickly becomes apparent that this isn’t your dad’s Pokémon adventure. Gone are series stalwarts like gym battles, obstacle-clearing special moves, even the need to fight creatures before lobbing a ball at them. Sure, you can always send a Pokémon in to battle to weaken your chosen target, but if you don’t fancy it, just bypass the brawl entirely by lobbing a well-timed Pokéball at your quarry. This time, it’s up to players to help researchers write the very first Pokémon encyclopedia: the Pokédex. Where the exploration segments and Pokémon battles were once separated into two separate screens, here the two are finally unified. Your trainer can run around battling Pokémon with no regard for their own safety. For arguably the first time since the series began, everything feels fresh, and thrillingly unpredictable. From crafting your very own wooden Pokéballs to carefully stalking wild Pokémon in real time, Legends’ immersive new approach immediately clicks. Thanks to the Feudal-era setting, the mammoth metropolises of previous games are gone. Your new homestead is the quaint and scenic hub of Jubilife Village, where you’ll find residents ploughing fields, cooking mochi and shifting whatever rudimentary goods or services they can offer. It’s all refreshingly calming and surprisingly low-stakes stuff, giving players the freedom to tackle their Poké-duties at whatever cadence they fancy. As your journey grows in scope and you roam new regions, your curiosity will naturally get the better of you. Freed from linear shackles and strolling Legends’ open plains, gigantic and exciting creatures are too much to ignore. While riding a majestic deer Pokémon toward my next quest, I regularly found myself stopping in my tracks, compelled to catch imposing creatures that I’d forgotten existed. The scale of these Pokémon is tangible, too. In your early hours roaming the plains of Hisui you’ll meet suitably pocket-sized monsters, but it’s not long before you come face to face with a gargantuan Parasect, one of the original 151 Pokémon. This weird, spore-emitting mushroom crab was never the most intimidating thing on a black-and-white screen, but now it’s downright terrifying. As its once-laughable attacks fill the screen in a purple poisonous hue, I find myself scurrying away in panic. Only, I’m too late. My poor, unsuspecting anime avatar cannot shake the smog, and gasping desperately for air, crumples sickeningly to the grass. While Arceus may be a sight that leads to sore eyes, this ambitious reboot sets Pokémon on an exciting new trajectory, finally recapturing a lost sense of adventure. What made those initial Pokémon games special was the way that they embodied a childlike spirit of discovery. The problem was that its creators struck gold on the first attempt – and spent decades repeating the same trick. Now, 26 years after I caught my very first Pokémon, the franchise is new again, and that gleeful sense of excitement is back. Pokémon Legends: Arceus is out now; £39.99",Arts/Games,Pokémon Legends: Arceus review – makes even old-school fans feel childlike again,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/10/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-makes-even-old-school-fans-feel-childlike-again
