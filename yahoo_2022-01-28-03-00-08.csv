1/28/2022,"Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley called on President Biden and VP Harris to resign. In a Fox News radio interview, Haley said Biden should ""step down and take Kamala with him."" Haley also said she's worried the US will look ""weak"" on foreign policy at the Beijing Olympics. Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley in a Fox News Radio interview on Wednesday called on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to ""step down."" ""If Biden loved our country, he would step down and take Kamala with him because the foreign policy situation is beyond dangerous at this point,"" Haley said on the ""Guy Benson Show."" If both Biden and Harris were to leave office, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would become president. Haley, a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate who was appointed to her UN post by former President Donald Trump in 2017, presented her critique of Biden's foreign policy in the context of the upcoming Olympic Winter Games in Beijing. ""The reason I pushed so hard for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics is because if they get a pass and we get past these Olympics and we still look weak, they're going to do whatever they want because they can,"" Haley said in part, referring to the Chinese government. Biden has called for a diplomatic boycott of the Olympics — meaning no US government officials or dignitaries will be in attendance — while still allowing the athletes to compete. Unlike Haley, Trump has not called for a boycott either. Earlier in the interview, Haley ticked through a series of qualms she has with the Biden administration on the international stage. ""We're suffering with the fact that, with the fall of Afghanistan, I mean you've got anywhere from Putin, Xi, Kim Jong Un in North Korea to the Ayatollahs in Iran, they all get what an amazing opportunity this is,"" she said. ""They know that they've never had a weak president like this before. They know they probably never will have another one again, so they are trying to get everything they can."" During his lone term in office, Trump spoke fondly about each of the Russian, Chinese and North Korean leaders Haley mentioned, part of a broader pattern experts have described as enabling and emboldening strongmen and dictators who want to hold onto their power for life — or be ""president for life,"" in Trump's words. Haley added that she doesn't think Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to invade Ukraine because it would be unpopular domestically, and that he is simply ""trying to leverage."" While Haley has been the subject of 2024 speculation, she is one of several high-profile Republicans who have come out to say they won't challenge Trump if he runs again.

1/28/2022,"A US Navy Commander has pleaded guilty to receiving $250,000 in cash and prostitution services from a foreign defence contractor in exchange for state secrets. Information Commander Stephen Shedd provided to the firm helped it defraud the navy of $35 billion (£26.1bn). The plea is the latest in the 'Fat Leonard' case, considered one of the worst corruption scandals faced by the navy. Dozens of officials have been ensnared. Shedd is one of nine members of the Okinawa-based 7th US fleet indicted by a federal grand jury in March 2017 for their role in the scandal, and the third officer to plead guilty. According to the Justice Department, Shedd and the other officers received ""sex parties with prostitutes and luxurious dinner and travel"" in exchange for military secrets and ""substantial influence"" for the Glenn Defense Marine Asia (GDMA) company, a Singapore-based firm founded by a Malaysian national, Leonard Glenn Francis. The scandal became widely known as the ""Fat Leonard"" scheme due to Francis's then-corpulent figure. He was arrested in California after being lured there by US officials there in 2013. He has since pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges and has remained in prison or home detention. According to prosecutors, information Shedd and others provided helped GDMA to win and maintain contracts and overbill the Navy by $35bn for services such as providing tugboats, security and waste removal to ships at port. As part of a plea deal, Shedd admitted that he and the other defendants gave Francis schedules of naval movements other information, and lobbied on behalf of GDMA to other naval officials. The defendant knew these efforts would result in the service paying GDMA's claims, the Justice Department said. A total of 34 naval officials, defence contractors and GDMA employees, including Francis, have been charged with crimes related to the scheme. Of these, 28 have pleaded guilty, including two other 7th fleet officers. Shedd is scheduled to be sentenced on 21 July in a California federal court, while the trial of the remaining six 7th fleet officers is due to begin on 28 February.

1/28/2022,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Nebraska-based voting machine company told the Republican-hired attorney leading an investigation into the 2020 presidential election in Wisconsin that it will not comply with subpoenas issued seeking a broad array of information. Attorneys for Election Systems & Software told former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman in a letter dated Jan. 21 that it would not comply, calling the subpoenas issued last month a “quintessential fishing expedition.” The letter was obtained Thursday by The Associated Press after it was first reported on by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Gableman has subpoenaed the mayors of Wisconsin's five largest cities, the state's top elections official, an immigrant rights group, ES&S and Dominion Voting Systems as part of his ongoing probe ordered after President Joe Biden narrowly defeated Donald Trump in the battleground state. Subpoenas to the elections commission, Voces de la Frontera and mayors of Green Bay and Madison are being fought in court. ES&S made clear it will not comply, telling Gableman in the letter that the company “is under no obligation to respond to any of the subpoenas.” The letter was signed by attorneys Michael Cox, Daniel Fischer and Michael Maistelman. Cox and Fischer are based in Omaha, Nebraska, the headquarters of ES&S. Maistelman, who is in Milwaukee, declined to elaborate Thursday on the correspondence. “The letter speaks for itself,” Maistelman said. In part, the attorneys said the subpoenas were not properly served and that Gableman can't compel ES&S to turn over records that would take weeks or months to produce and are in Nebraska, not Wisconsin. Additionally, they said Gableman can't force someone from the company to sit for a closed-door interview. Gableman's ability to question mayors and the state's elections administrator in private is also being challenged in the other lawsuits. A judge earlier this month did not block the subpoenas to the elections administrator but also put off a ruling on whether they are valid. Republicans are trying to have the case dismissed. The ES&S letter calls the subpoenas “quintessential fishing expeditions casting their nets as wide as possible in the hopes that something which might actually be sought is caught within the net but amidst the thousands upon thousands of other documents and pages that have no relevancy to the matter.” The attorneys said the request appeared to be for every communication the company had over a two-year period related to elections in Wisconsin, including proprietary information about software code for voting machines. Gableman did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Biden's victory by just under 21,000 votes over Trump has withstood multiple recounts, lawsuits and reviews. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos hired Gableman to investigate at a cost of $676,000 in taxpayer money.",Politics/Associated Press,Voting machine company won't comply with Wisconsin subpoena,https://news.yahoo.com/voting-machine-company-wont-comply-164708518.html
1/28/2022,"Meghan McCain is detailing her “rough” battle with COVID-19. The former co-host of The View, who is the daughter of the late Arizona senator John McCain, penned a column for The Daily Mail in which she shared that she and her husband, The Federalist publisher Ben Domenech, tested positive for COVID earlier this year. Though McCain and Domenech are both fully vaccinated, she said that they got “very sick.” While Domenech waited outside for a PCR test, McCain was too unwell to make the trek, and confirmed her positive test result thanks to her sister-in-law dropping off a rapid test for her. “I am still now, a few weeks out from testing positive, waking up feeling the aftereffects of a cold in my throat, getting fatigued easily, and unable to taste food or smell anything normally. I have been lighting candles all over the house waiting for this to change,” McCain wrote of her experience with the virus. “I do not want to sound like a baby, or ungrateful because I am well aware of how much worse things could have been, but COVID was much rougher than I anticipated given that we are fully-vaccinated. What I experienced wasn't mild, it wasn't easy, and I am still fearful of the unknown long-term side effects that I may experience.” The Bad Republican author also slammed President Biden over the lack of easy access to rapid at-home testing, as well as readily available treatments. It was just last month that McCain was questioning whether booster shots, mask mandates and vaccine mandates were necessary in another column for The Daily Mail. “​​As of today, the Omicron variant is known to have killed one person globally, even though that number is tragically sure to rise. But for some college students in New York to go back to school they must receive the booster — something that was originally only recommended for the elderly and immunocompromised,” she wrote in an article published on Dec. 15, 2021. “So where exactly does this leave us? It appears there is a segment of the population that is entirely comfortable being masked forever, having our children as young as 2-years-old exist in a world where they are educated and socialized only if they have a mask on their face, and requiring that we get a booster shot — I can assume — every six months for the rest of our lives.” It is unclear whether McCain and her husband received a third shot of the vaccine, which was recommended as the Omicron variant has significantly impacted the effectiveness of the current vaccines, particularly when it comes to preventing infection. The CDC defines ""fully vaccinated"" as either having received two-doses of the MRNA vaccines or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. While McCain has been outspoken about mandates, she enthusiastically received her initial series of the vaccines in 2021. In March of 2021, she said on The View, “I’m happy to get a vaccine live on the show. I do trust science. I trust doctors, and quite frankly I would let them put an iPod nano between my shoulder blades if it means I can get drunk at Caesar’s Palace again.” Fox News star reportedly Lisa Boothe lost a job as new host of  ""The View"" because of her stance on the COVID-19 vaccine, a report said.

1/28/2022,"HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) — Sarah Kelly recalls the fleeting moments when she reached out for help during a decadeslong opioid addiction, only to find out no residential treatment beds were available in an overloaded system in her corner of West Virginia. In the hardest-hit county in the nation's worst-hit state for drug overdose deaths per capita, Kelly’s struggles with prescription pain pills cost her custody of her two children. Her younger sister died of a heart infection from intravenous drug use in 2017. Somehow, the Huntington resident wouldn't let her addiction win. “I was so tired of living without them,” Kelly said. “I couldn’t live without them anymore.” Six months have passed since closing arguments were held in the first lawsuit over the U.S. addiction epidemic to go to trial. It blames three pharmaceutical companies for their role in the opioid crisis in the Huntington area. For Kelly and others who know the desperation that comes with addiction, the time it's taken to render a verdict seems out of step with the urgency they feel. Kelly eventually found treatment and went to court to get her kids back. She's been in recovery since October 2019. But that nightmare of being unable to locate a bed right away comes rushing back as a decision looms in the lawsuit. Cabell County and the city of Huntington sued AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp. A federal judge must rule whether the companies created a public nuisance in distributing 81 million prescription pain pills over eight years — and whether they ignored signs that the Ohio River community was being ravaged by addiction. The plaintiffs are seeking more than $2.5 billion. The money would go toward prevention, treatment and education. Kelly, 38, said the help can't come fast enough. “There’s people dying every single day,” Kelly said. “So many of us are lucky to be alive and have found treatment. There’s a lot of people that could really benefit from this. There's a lot of programs that could benefit from this and save lives.” From 2015 to 2020, Cabell County had 8,252 people — about 10% of its population — suffering from opioid use disorder, plaintiffs attorney Paul T. Farrell Jr. said in his closing arguments, citing expert testimony. The county has 106 Medicaid-approved beds for residential treatment of those patients, according to the state Department of Health and Human Resources. Closing arguments were held in late July after the nearly three-month bench trial in Charleston. U.S. District Judge David Faber has yet to indicate when he might rule. “It is worrisome that it is taking a long time, even though we know these things take time,” said Kim Miller, an addiction counselor at Prestera Center, a Huntington treatment facility. “The longer it takes, the more questions arise, and the less likely it feels to get a satisfying verdict.” For many people who have abused prescription pain pills, any money from the trial “is going to come too late,” Miller said. In Cabell County last year, there were nearly 900 emergency medical responses for suspected overdoses. In 3% of the cases, the patient was pronounced dead at the scene. An estimated 1,400 emergency room visits in the county were related to overdoses, according to the DHHR. Attorneys familiar with the trial said they're not alarmed by the months without a verdict. “A lot of people have been waiting for a long time, and maybe people underestimate the complexity of the case and the difficulty of coming to a resolution,"" said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor. “I think Judge Faber is just taking the time that is needed to get it right.” West Virginia University law professor Patrick McGinley, representing the newspaper group HD Media, was instrumental in forcing the Drug Enforcement Administration to release a database of distributor pain pill shipments across the United States, including more than 1 billion to West Virginia from 2006 to 2014. The Charleston Gazette-Mail won a 2017 Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the state’s opioid crisis. McGinley, who teaches a seminar in prescription opioid litigation, said the trial in Faber's courtroom “would produce thousands if not tens of thousands of pages of transcripts of testimony, hundreds if not thousands of exhibits,"" and then Faber has to research the law. Public nuisance claims drive some 3,000 lawsuits brought by state and local governments against drugmakers, distribution companies and pharmacies. Faber can peek at cases in other states; since the end of closing arguments, other opioid trials have come and gone. In northern Ohio, a federal jury in November ruled that CVS, Walgreens and Walmart pharmacies recklessly distributed massive amounts of pain pills in two counties. A judge will decide by spring how much the pharmacies must pay in damages. A jury on New York’s Long Island found in late December that drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals contributed to the opioid crisis there. A separate trial will determine what Teva will have to pay. Drug companies prevailed in lawsuits decided in November in northern California  and in Oklahoma. A judge rejected OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma’s sweeping settlement of thousands of lawsuits in December. Another judge refused to allow litigation to move ahead against members of the Sackler family who own the company but also ordered negotiations for a reworked settlement. The opioid crisis has been linked to more than 500,000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000, counting overdoses of both prescription opioids and illicit ones such as heroin and fentanyl. McGinley said that although Cabell County and Huntington need resources now to deal with the opioid problem, the case likely won’t end with Faber’s decision. “This is the legal process; we have to ensure fairness and compliance with the rule of law,” McGinley said. “There’s a saying: The wheels of justice grind exceedingly slow. That’s certainly what it seems in a case like this.”",U.S./Associated Press,An opioid-ravaged West Virginia town awaits trial verdict,https://news.yahoo.com/opioid-ravaged-west-virginia-town-175143171.html
