3/20/2022,"Formula One’s new era opened with the shake-up at the front of the grid the sport had been hoping for in Bahrain as Charles Leclerc and Ferrari claimed a thrilling pole position in front of reigning champion Max Verstappen. Behind Leclerc, qualifying heralded a potential dog-fight between three manufacturers at the front of the field with Mercedes in the unusual position of playing catch-up to rivals Red Bull and a resurgent Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton could manage only fifth place for Mercedes with his teammate George Russell ninth. Verstappen could not take his Red Bull to better than second to Leclerc who believed he could have put in an even faster lap as Ferrari delivered on their pre-season promise with Carlos Sainz in third. Sergio Pérez was in fourth for Red Bull with Valtteri Bottas sixth for Alfa Romeo. The two Mercedes went out early in Q3 for their first runs but it was Sainz on top for the opening hot laps, with a time of 1min 30.687sec, four hundredths up on Leclerc and Verstappen – who appeared to have an issue putting the heat into his tyres as the air cooled in the darkness of Bahrain– a further one-hundredth back. Hamilton was more than a second down having used worn tyres. For the final decisive laps, Hamilton went quicker but could not trouble the leaders, ultimately six tenths off the lead. Leclerc put in an almighty lap with a time of 1:30.558 and much as Verstappen attacked he could not match it, a tenth back, just in front of Sainz. A jubilant Leclerc celebrated in delivering what he had felt was the real potential of his car but noted ominously he felt there was more to come. It is his 10th pole position and Ferrari’s first since Leclerc took the top spot in Baku last year. He is in a very good position to convert it to their first win since Sebastian Vettel won at Singapore in 2019. Leclerc has not won a race since Monza in 2019 but has good form at the Bahrain International Circuit. He took pole here and was conformably leading in 2019 only to lose a likely win due to a problem with his energy recovery unit. Ferrari had been quietly pleased with testing, where they ran relentlessly and with some pace but will be enormously buoyed by the performance of their car in the crucible of qualifying. Finally free to fully push to the limit, Leclerc was able to extract a mighty lap that amply demonstrated what a competitive car Ferrari have. Last year’s decision to put the vast majority of their resources into developing this year’s car has clearly paid off. It is stable, well-balanced and, despite the extra weight from the new regulations, is allowing the drivers to throw it at corners. The porpoising problem plaguing other teams, particularly Mercedes, has been all but eliminated and Leclerc’s pace demonstrated just how well the car is dialled-in. On the first truly competitive run for these brand new cars, unleashed on low fuel and with their engines turned up to the max, Leclerc held a slender advantage. With the phoney war of testing over, the early season pecking order was finally on display and while Red Bull and Ferrari were on fine form, qualifying only confirmed just what a huge job Mercedes have in front of them. Hamilton won at this race last year, despite once more being outpaced by Red Bull, such a turnaround looks to be a bridge too far for the British driver this time. The problems facing Mercedes have no straightforward or quick fix. Their car is suffering from what has become known as porpoising, a term originally coined by Mario Andretti in the 1980s, the last time ground-effect cars were used. The car jars up and down on the straight, as the ground-effect downforce compresses the floor so low that the downforce is lost and the car springs back up, restoring the downforce and cycling it back down again. The resulting bounding leads to a loss of pace as drivers lift off and causes locking-up. It can be ameliorated by adjusting the setup of the car at the cost of lap time. With the Saudi Arabian GP next week Mercedes have no chance to return the car to the factory to work on the problem. The Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said there were five or six issues where there was “big performance” to be gained. Kevin Magnussen, back with Haas, was an impressive seventh, with Fernando Alonso eighth for Alpine. Pierre Gasly was 10th for AlphaTauri. Esteban Ocon was 11th for Alpine and Mick Schumacher 12th for Haas. Lando Norris was 13th for McLaren while Alex Albon made a good return to F1 with Williams, finishing 14th. Guanyu Zhou, the first Chinese driver in F1, was 15th for Alfa Romeo. Yuki Tsunoda was 16th for AlphaTauri, with the two Aston Martins of Nico Hulkenberg and Lance Stroll in 17th and 19th. Daniel Ricciardo was a disappointing 18th for McLaren and Nicholas Latifi 20th for Williams.",Sport/Sport,Leclerc claims pole for Bahrain GP as Hamilton and Mercedes struggle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/leclerc-claims-pole-for-bahrain-gp-as-hamilton-and-mercedes-struggle
3/20/2022,"Bournemouth took a significant step towards promotion back to the Premier League with an impressive victory at third-placed Huddersfield Town to open up a six-point gap between themselves and the Terriers. Scott Parker’s side knew defeat in West Yorkshire would have seen them level with Carlos Corberan’s side by the close of play here. However, they navigated what looked a tricky test on paper to create a sizable buffer over both Huddersfield and Luton Town, whose victory at Hull moved them above Town into third place. Goals from Jaidon Anthony and Jefferson Lerma put the Cherries into a 2-0 lead by half-time which their dominance thoroughly deserved. The opener came when the outstanding Dominic Solanke’s ball across goal found Anthony unmarked to break the deadlock. Bournemouth then doubled that lead when Lerma fired into an empty net after Lee Nicholls had saved well from Solanke, sending Parker and the visitors’ bench into raptures. Corberan responded at half-time by taking off Tom Lees, a mainstay of the defensive unit that has propelled Huddersfield into promotion contention this season. But within seconds of the restart, they fell further behind as Solanke claimed the goal his all-round performance merited, with the striker cleverly backheeling past Nicholls to make it 3-0. It was an accomplished finish from Solanke, who led Bournemouth’s line with aplomb all afternoon. Solanke’s strike effectively ended the game as a contest, with the gulf in quality between the two sides in the final third now underlined by the scoreline. There was no shortage of effort and endeavour from the hosts, but their failure to create any clear-cut opportunities in the second half meant there was never much hope of a comeback for Bournemouth to worry about.",Sport/Football,Bournemouth step up promotion bid with emphatic win at Huddersfield,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/huddersfield-bournemouth-championship-match-report
3/20/2022,"Two weeks ago, Alani Iyanuoluwa fled Kyiv as the Russian invasion intensified. Making her way across Europe, the 24-year-old hoped to be reunited with family in London. Yet for 10 days she has been stranded in a French port – because she is Nigerian. Iyanuoluwa is among a growing number of refugees who claim the British government is ignoring black people who fled Ukraine. Their experiences have again raised the issue of race and the UK’s welcome to refugees, prompting claims that ministers would never have unveiled last week’s humanitarian sponsorship scheme for Ukrainians had it not been aimed at white Europeans. Critics say that while Michael Gove’s scheme places no limit on numbers, it contrasts sharply with the government’s visa scheme for Afghans, which promised spaces for just 5,000 people in the first year. When the scheme finally opened in January, it emerged that most of those spots would be taken by Afghans already living in Britain. A previous sponsorship scheme, launched in 2015 and largely for Syrian refugees, has been hampered by bureaucracy, managing about 700 placements in seven years compared with Gove’s promise of “tens of thousands” for Ukrainians. Alba Kapoor, senior policy manager at the Runnymede Trust, said the UK’s response to the Ukrainian crisis had thrown up questions of parity amid claims that black people fleeing the conflict tended to be “dehumanised” and viewed as African migrants rather than Ukrainian refugees. “There’s an obvious question, which is why people of colour who are fleeing war and terror and persecution do not have the right to equal treatment to others,” she said. “We are still confronted by an inability to properly conceive people from the global south as humans if they are trying to flee war and persecution. That’s a sad place to be – it’s not just the government, but also the press.” Kapoor said no Alan Kurdi moment – the Syrian boy photographed lying dead on a Turkish beach in 2015 – had been needed to galvanise support for refugees fleeing the fighting. Jabeer Butt, chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, said: “Devastatingly, race has undoubtedly been an issue in the level of support provided by the UK government for refugees from Ukraine compared with those from Afghanistan and other places that have faced terrible conflict in recent years.” The government’s preoccupation with viewing refugees on the basis of where they came from needed to be re-examined. “We cannot blindly accept a tiered system whereby people’s needs are prioritised based on nationality. This feels like being asked by the government to accept that in Britain we value the lives of people with a certain skin colour over others,” he said. Iyanuoluwa is staying with two other Nigerian students in Boulogne-sur-Mer. All three fear returning to Nigeria because of the dangers of kidnapping and trafficking, but say that as non-Ukrainian nationals they are not eligible for the British schemes, despite two of them having family in the UK. “We’re coming from war and they are telling us that without a Ukrainian passport we can’t come to the UK, but the UK should consider all residents living in Ukraine when the war started,” she said. Iyanuoluwa is among a large group identified by charities that appears to have been split up from other Ukrainians by authorities because they are black. They include Kevin Kanjuru, from Kenya, who was studying computer science in Kyiv when Russia invaded and has family in Britain – an uncle in Northampton with UK citizenship who is also a local councillor. They also include Nigerian Michael Uwandu who lived in Ukraine for 12 years but who was separated from his nine-year-old daughter and Ukrainian ex partner who fled before him and has lost contact with them. The 37-year-old was granted Ukrainian citizenship in late February but had to leave before collecting his passport. Uwandu should be eligible for Gove’s scheme but the lack of proof of citizenship appears to have hampered his application and he has a sister, a British national, and cousin in the UK he is trying to join. Others seemingly stranded include an Afghan refugee who had refugee status in Ukraine, but is not eligible for the sponsorship scheme – despite a UK national offering to sponsor her. Clare Moseley, founder of the charity Care4Calais, said: “The UK schemes to help Ukrainian refugees come to Britain are heavily biased towards Ukrainian nationals. But they are not the only people whose homes and lives have been destroyed by the conflict.” The government’s nationalities and borders bill, which is to return to the House of Commons in the coming weeks, intends to criminalise anyone arriving in the UK without permission, as all asylum seekers do. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities rejected the claims as “utterly baseless.” A spokesperson said: “We are working as fast as possible to house refugees from across the world and are proud this country has provided homes for more than 4,000 Afghans evacuees in such a short space of time. “The £10,500 provided to councils to support each [Ukranian] arrival is the same level of funding as under the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme and we urge councils to join those who have pledged to support Afghan families, and those who can offer more housing places, to do so.”",News/World news,Stranded Nigerians accuse UK of ignoring pleas of black refugees fleeing Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/stranded-nigerians-accuse-uk-of-ignoring-pleas-of-black-refugees-fleeing-ukraine
3/20/2022,"Guy Singh-Watson has gone totally nuts. He’s striding through a field of saplings, lively spaniel Artichoke bounding around his feet, extolling the virtues and drawbacks of growing walnuts, hazelnuts and chestnuts. At 61, and having sold a majority stake in his Riverford organic veg box business to employees four years ago, Singh-Watson could be forgiven for slowing down. Instead, the keen sailor and surfer has caught the next wave. Some of his Riverford money has been invested in the nut trees, and he also has a composting project, to use biodegradable packaging and boxes from the company’s vegetable deliveries. He has converted outbuildings on his farm into space for small business startups. And he bought a small yacht, whose bow can be seen poking out of a barn. Started in 1986 as experiment in growing organic vegetables on the family farm, Riverford began by supplying supermarkets. Tiring of that, in 1993 Singh-Watson started using an old Citroën to deliver the produce to about 30 friends. During the pandemic, families across the country turned to home deliveries as a way to dodge the virus, and Riverford’s veg box sales soared to 85,000 a week at the peak in 2020, from about 50,000 at the start of that year. The demand propelled turnover to almost £110m in the year to May 2021, compared with £75.7m before the pandemic. The company made a pretax profit of almost £12m (after a £1.5m loss the year before), Its workers received a profit share of £3,800 each, whatever their pay level, and £1.8m was ploughed into climate and biodiversity measures. Singh-Watson, who added Singh to his name after his second marriage in 2014 to restaurateur Geetie Singh, says sales could have been higher had Riverford had more capacity. It is now pondering investing £20m in a new packing house. Riverford has stolen a march on the major supermarkets by making all its food packaging biodegradable, at an additional annual cost of £500,000. It is in the process of converting its fleet of delivery vans to 100% electric by 2025. It is also testing out e-cargo bikes for deliveries in some urban areas and has stopped dealing in products with too big a carbon footprint – such as New Zealand apples. These efforts have helped Riverford hold on to its recent converts. In the year to May this year, sales are expected to hit £112m and profits about £7m, with another bonus for workers expected. Singh-Watson sees this as vindication of his decision to hand majority ownership to the staff, rather than the potentially more lucrative alternative of private equity investment. He believes employee ownership helped the business through the tough times of the pandemic, when demand shot up and labour was scarce: “people were prepared to go that extra mile”. “We were asking people selling veg boxes to drive vans, and people from offices to go into the fields – and on the whole they embraced it pretty well,” he says. Finding people to pick and pack crops from the fields continues to be a challenge since Brexit put paid to the ready supply of “brilliant, skilled, hardworking and hardy” eastern Europeans who have worked there for about 20 years. Working holidays for students is one alternative Singh-Watson is mulling. “This year we are reasonably confident we will get enough staff, but there is no doubt about the direction of travel. Getting people to work in physical jobs on the land is getting more and more difficult,” he says. Brexit has hit the business in other ways, including increasing the cost of importing produce from Singh-Watson’s farm in France during the winter. He says the changes have added about 4%, due in part to the additional paperwork and also to the extra staff to deal with problems such as extra waste caused by a lack of flexibility on shipments. “We will adjust, but for what?” he asks. “Where are the upsides? One day we may be better off, but look at the world we’re living in. We’re better off with Europe than having to negotiate with Putin and China.” The nut orchard is Singh-Watson’s latest brainwave for producing sustainable food close to home, part of a project in which a tree is planted for every new customer recommendation from existing clients. He’s convinced those same customers can be persuaded to buy more nuts and less meat to help save the planet. “I don’t think we can rely on food from abroad. With all the disruption in the world it is obvious that long global food chains will be a thing of the past. If we can’t produce most of our own food and energy, we are in a pretty dangerous position. We need to find more ways to do that in harmony with nature, and that will probably mean paying a bit more for food – if only marginally.” The group put its prices up by between 4% and 5% in January and Singh-Watson warns that prices may have to rise again before the end of this year as fuel and other costs continue to rise. With that in mind he is wary of banking on continued expansion this year. “The world is full of so much disruption. We had Brexit and then Covid-19 and now a war, and that’s totally disruptive to trade patterns. We are talking about a massive squeeze on incomes. Anyone who assumes things are going to continue as they are is a fool.” He says he learned that lesson from the 2008 financial crash, when Riverford was caught out by a downturn in sales of organic foods as families concentrated on saving cash. But despite the pressure on incomes, he believes Riverford will continue to have a place on families’ shopping lists. “I feel confident, whatever the trends in supermarkets and the media, that people want a healthier diet that comes from less distance, and is produced with environmental [care]. They want to know where their food comes from.”",News/Business,Guy Singh-Watson: Riverford founder still digging for the future,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/19/guy-singh-watson-riverford-founder-still-digging-for-the-future
3/20/2022,"The Ezra Klein Show (The New York Times) | nytimes.comFile on Four: Ukraine: War Stories (Radio 4) | BBC SoundsInvaded: Voicemails from Ukraine (Tortoise Media) | tortoisemedia.comExplaining Ukraine (UkraineWorld) | spotifyThe Sky News Daily Podcast (Sky) | sky.comWar on Truth (Radio 4) BBC Sounds God, the news is devastating at the moment. At least it is here. On Ezra Klein’s podcast, New Yorker staff writer Masha Gessen explained that, in Russia, the news is… OK. Same as ever. Just the usual five minute on-the-hour TV bulletin. Perhaps a mention of the “special military operation” in Ukraine, but “the actual tenor and flow of news hasn’t changed”. “When I was flying to Moscow,” said Gessen, “in the air terminals [with] those giant [TV] displays, you could tell, without even listening, that something huge was happening in the world. It’s the opposite in Russia. The picture hasn’t changed, the tenor hasn’t changed, the timing hasn’t changed. The overall message is: nothing much is going on.” Something definitely is going on, of course, and it’s possible (if you’re not in Russia) to feel overwhelmed by the relentless news of destruction and killing. For some, the answer is to switch off; for others, there is comfort in trying to understand. The Ezra Klein Show is one place to start. Klein, a US political journalist, has been hosting this podcast since 2015; it was co-opted by the New York Times at the start of 2021. Klein is a very good interviewer, because he’s so well-informed and thoughtful and usually the twice-weekly show covers a variety of topics, such as Covid, the climate crisis, kindness, cryptocurrencies. However, like many other political podcasts, his show has talked of nothing except Ukraine for the past four episodes. Gessen, his last-but-one interviewee, who was born in Russia and lived there for many years, was beautifully articulate. Klein asked whether Putin believes what he says in public and Gessen used the way that teenagers argue as an illustrative example: how a teen can tell a lie and then, when you challenge them, absolutely deny it “and the longer the argument goes on, the more attached they will be to the thing they lied to you about, even though you both know that they were lying”. I’ve just started the latest episode, which features the heavyweight historian Timothy Snyder and it’s impressive too, as was the episode before the Gessen one, where Klein discussed Putin’s motivations with Fiona Hill, the co-author of a Putin biography. Be warned, though, that that one’s pretty depressing (“He’s going to double and triple down on the military side of things,” said Hill). It’s interesting, when you search out podcasts about the war, that so many talk about Putin. All the learned information about his history and motivations seems worldly wise when you’re discussing the situation from New York or London. On the ground in Ukraine, though, clever words float into the air, like dust. On Radio 4’s heart-rending File on Four last week, we heard from several Ukrainians who were simply living their lives and woke up to bombing. One was Marie, a young woman who lives in Chernihiv. Her voice noticeably changed from her first, upbeat, phone recording to her second and third. Her breath came shallow and fast. She was in shock. More Ukrainians explaining clearly what war is like in Invaded: Voicemails from Ukraine, a daily podcast from Tortoise Media. The show returns to certain people, so we’ve joined teacher Naliia from her initial shock through her leaving her home to worrying about her family, and been with Oleksandr and the volunteers preparing for Russian attacks. Normal people in abnormal situations. Two more Ukrainian voices, too, on Explaining Ukraine, hosted by Volodymyr Yermolenko, an analytics director at Internews Ukraine, and Tetyana Ogarkova, from the Ukraine Crisis Media Centre. Explaining Ukraine is part of the Ukraine World group, which tries to counter disinformation. Once, this was a podcast explaining Ukraine and its culture; now it’s a daily war report. Yermolenko, who is in Kyiv, sounds tired: “The key news is that Russians are shelling with missiles, Kyiv… It’s frightening, you wake up in the morning and you have the increased heartbeat.” A tough listen, both for tonal and factual reasons, but it reports what’s happening as it happens. A couple of other programmes to recommend (and don’t forget the BBC’s Ukrainecast, presented by Victoria Derbyshire and Gabriel Gatehouse, which I’ve mentioned in a previous column). Sky News Daily has pivoted to the war and is doing an excellent job. Occasionally, it offers not much more than a behind-the-scenes look at a TV news show, which can be a little frustrating: the descriptions of how Sky TV landed its interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy made me wonder why we couldn’t hear the audio of the interview straight afterwards. But overall, it’s clever and revealing. In one of the most recent episodes, Jack Taylor, from its “data and forensics unit”, explained the difficulties with online information: someone in Mariupol could film a nearby building being blown up, but the very fact of the explosion means that they are less likely to post it, because the explosion means there’s no power. Speaking of power, and of online reporting, Marianna Spring, the Beeb’s exemplary disinformation correspondent, has just started a podcast that looks at the role of fake news in the war. In War on Truth, she’s been talking to TikTokers who’ve been posting videos of what’s happening and have been flamed by what appear to be Russian-based bots for doing so. Anyway, despite all the clever explanations, it’s the shows that feature real-life Ukrainians living through this real-life hell that stick with you. On Explaining Ukraine, Yermolenko and Ogarkova ask for a no-fly zone on every show. I certainly don’t know the answer to this war, and I know that Ukraine is being helped behind the scenes, but when victims tell you what they need, perhaps we should listen. Otherwise, we’re just standing around a kid being beaten up by a bully, filming it on our phones and chatting.",Arts/Television & radio,The week in audio: the best podcasts on the conflict in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/19/the-week-in-audio-the-best-podcasts-on-the-conflict-in-ukraine
3/20/2022,"In a competitive field, passwords are one of the worst things about the internet. Long and complex passwords are more secure but difficult to remember, leaving many people using weak and easy-to-guess credentials. One study by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) revealed how millions are using their pet’s name, football team names, ‘password’ and “123456” to access online services. But this leaves you wide open to attack: cybercriminals can crack weak passwords in seconds using automated tools. “A hacker needs roughly two seconds to crack an 11-character password made up of numbers,” says Alex Balan, director of security research at security company Bitdefender. If the password is more complex, containing numbers, symbols and uppercase and lowercase letters, the time needed to break it jumps to 400 years. Experts say a good password should be unique and contain a combination of letters, numbers and special characters. The key to a strong one is length, says Wright. “While password complexity does help, the length matters far more.” Experts recommend a minimum of 11 characters, more if possible. The typical internet user has about 100 sets of login details – memorising this number of complex passwords is well beyond most people’s powers of recall. Password manager apps can resolve this problem by creating long and complex credentials for you, and remembering them the next time you log in. Yet only about one in five people in the UK use one, according to recent estimates. Many people are put off by the hassle, while others are suspicious about allowing one company to store all of their passwords. How do you know which one is trustworthy, and what if the company is hacked? It might seem daunting at first, but a password manager will make your life a lot easier. Here’s everything you need to know. Once you’ve downloaded a password manager, such as 1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden or Dashlane, you can follow the instructions to import your logins from somewhere else such as your browser. You can also start from scratch if you want, and delete accounts you don’t need any more as you go along. After setting it up, the app can generate strong passwords for you for any new sites you use, and these will autofill as you browse. This solves one of the toughest aspects of password security: remembering lots of complex credentials. “Since password managers take care of the remembering part, every password can be a long, totally random selection of characters,” says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security firm ESET. Password managers also ensure you use a unique login for each account, rather than repeating them across services. This is crucial for preventing “credential-stuffing” attacks, which happen when a hacker uses your compromised password, for example from Facebook, to try to get into other well-known services you might use such as Netflix or Spotify. Another often overlooked benefit is that most password managers help prevent phishing attacks, where scammers will encourage you to click a link so they can steal your credentials. “Since they tie the credentials to a specific web address, the autocomplete will not work on phishing sites,” says independent security researcher Sean Wright. In some cases you can even use password managers to securely share a login with other trusted people, such as family members. They also allow you to store pin codes, credit card details and online banking credentials securely. One major misconception about password managers is that having your credentials stored in one place is a risk. “I am often asked: ‘What if someone is able to access my password manager?’, but using one is far better than reusing the same credentials for all accounts,” Moore says. While there is a small risk in placing all your logins in one place, the likelihood of the password manager being breached is extremely low, says Wright. Password managers keep your details secure by encrypting your logins so they can only be accessed when you enter the master password. “Your plain text passwords are never stored on your device or on the password manager’s servers,” says Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate at Comparitech. Setting up a password manager is probably the biggest hurdle for those diving in, but you can do it gradually, changing passwords as you go. Once you have set up your app, it’ll save you the time you spend now resetting logins you’ve forgotten. Some see cost as an issue, but password managers are often free, or available for a few pounds a month. If you do decide to pay, the subscription will be worth it if you consider the costs of being hacked and details such as bank accounts being accessed. Apple Keychain and the Google Chrome Password Manager are password managers, but they lack the features of “full-service” ones. Sticking with Apple or Google means you can’t easily use your password manager with other devices or browsers. Apple Keychain and Google Chrome help strengthen protection, but you will struggle to easily move across devices without an independent password manager, says Moore. “Although it’s better than reusing passwords, a third-party password manager usually offers more features and can be easily accessed across devices.” Keep in mind that the password manager will need a master password, which you’ll need to be able to remember. This should be as long and complex as possible, for example a phrase or set of memorable words including some random characters and numbers. Some password apps let you know when one of your accounts has been compromised. The website HaveIBeenPwned is another trustworthy method of looking up whether your passwords have appeared in any known breach. Apple also offers a function to detect hacked passwords, under Settings > Passwords > Security Recommendations. If any of your passwords have been compromised, it’s a good idea to change them, on the breached site as well as any other websites where you use the same credentials. Of all your passwords, your email is most important. If a criminal is able to access your email, they could steal information including banking details, or send messages pretending to be you to scam people. Worse, they could use your email to reset all your other passwords, taking control of your accounts. For this reason, the NCSC says you should create an extra-strong password for this account, using a password manager if possible. Experts recommend passwords – and password managers – are backed by two-factor authentication, whereby you are asked for something such as a one-time code in addition to a password when you log in using a new device. For the more adventurous of you, there is the option to use a security key such as a YubiKey – a token you can insert into your device to double-secure high-risk accounts such as email. Authenticator apps such as Authy are another option. These generate a unique code for you to enter into the site and are very straightforward to use. If this all seems too technical, or you are managing passwords for an elderly parent or grandparent, there is another option. While they’re sometimes mocked, physical password books aren’t a bad idea, as long as you follow the guidelines in creating strong, unique logins, and the book is kept somewhere secure and doesn’t leave the house. And it goes without saying that you should never create a “virtual” book or document on your computer, which could be viewable if your device is hacked.",News/Technology,Not using a password manager?

3/20/2022,"Writing for Observer Food Monthly has brought me lots of excitement down the years, most recently an offer of more salty liquorice than might be strictly advisable. But the adventure of which I still think most often, and most fondly, also delivered a good friend to me – “a dear pal”, as he would put it – in the form of the great cook Jeremy Lee, with whom I first bonded halfway up a mountain in Scotland in 2004. I won’t bore you with the details now (they involve an elusive stag, an enveloping mist, and a certain physical feebleness on both our parts). All I can say is that I had then never been so glad to share a Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer with another human being. Eat your heart out, John Buchan. Jeremy is the chef at Quo Vadis in Soho, London, and earlier this month the 10th anniversary of his arrival at that magnificent establishment was marked with a swanky dinner for friends and colleagues. It was an overwhelmingly lovely night. House cocktails were served, as pink and ineffably chic as ever, and then we feasted on some of the things, simple but marvellously good, I will always associate with his restaurant: smoked eel on toast, roast pork with mashed potato, meringues as big as the hill on which I first got to know him. All night, Jeremy moved from room to room in his trademark French-style worker’s jacket: a smiling, kindly presence. For a few impossible hours, I enjoyed the illusion that all was right with the world. Afterwards, lying tipsily in bed, I thought about Quo Vadis: how much I love it; how much I would miss it if, God forbid, it ever disappeared. (I only came to understand fully what a taste-free fool Liz Truss truly must be when I read that she had refused to host a US trade representative there, choosing instead to take him to some vastly more expensive private members’ club for dinner.) I thought, too, of some other favourite long-standing London restaurants: Moro, in Clerkenwell, which is 25; St John, down the road, which must be approaching 30. My mind spinning on (too much – or too little – wine), I tried to picture the Old Vicarage, in Ridgeway in Derbyshire, where I celebrated getting a place at university with my dad, and Ashoka, which claims to be Sheffield’s oldest Indian restaurant. There will always be fashionable, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it restaurants, and people will always rush to eat in them. But it’s the ones that last that take up residence in our hearts. All the things that can happen in one place, good and bad. The drama! At Quo Vadis, I was sitting next to Sam Clark, the co-owner of Moro, and as I told him – poor man, me droning on – so much has happened to me there, not just birthdays and the occasional career triumph. It was at Moro that a man who claimed to be in love with me left the table to go and ring his girlfriend, an experience that, at the time, I found more humiliating than I can possibly say. (It gets worse: when he returned, approximately 8 minutes and 47 seconds later, he had the temerity to be annoyed by my sudden loss of appetite, as if it was me who was spoiling the fun.) What I find is that the bad stuff doesn’t change how fondly you feel about somewhere. A beloved restaurant is a bit like home in that sense: safe, steady, restorative. If it solemnises the highs, it absorbs the lows, too. You go back, you order your favourite dish – cardamom and rosewater ice-cream, in the case of Moro – and the sadness is soon rubbed out. It may be hard, sometimes, no longer to be the cool place; to watch your best customers growing older. But in the end, what you have is far, far more valuable: relationships that may be traced back many years; deep affection, even love, on the part of your regulars. Eventually, you pass into the kitchen equivalent of elder statesman territory. You have authority, and all the beautiful calm that comes with it – and of course people have children, and godchildren, and nieces and nephews. A new generation arrives, (re)discoveries are made. The circle is complete, and begins to turn again. All this was in my mind as I tried to sleep – this, and the sense that I had surely eaten one too many spoonfuls of meringue.",Lifestyle/Food,The restaurants we love are woven into our lives | Rachel Cooke,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/19/the-restaurants-we-love-are-woven-into-our-lives
3/20/2022,"So much for sentiment. This was supposed to be a day to celebrate two of Wales’ greats. Alun Wyn Jones and Dan Biggar respectively earned their 150th and 100th Test caps for their country. Cardiff’s grand arena was bathed in glorious sunshine. They were playing a team on a 36-game losing streak in the Six Nations. What could go wrong? When Josh Adams scored a solo try with 10 minutes remaining he looked to have given his team an undeserving win. The men in red were turgid, uncreative and ill-disciplined. But Biggar’s conversion meant they had a 21-15 lead. They were back in control. Then Ange Capuozzo collected the ball 25 metres from his own try line with a minute remaining. The diminutive fullback put on the afterburners and galloped up field as if those around him were slogging through porridge. He stepped one defender and then another. He cut back off his right foot and found Edoardo Padovani on his inside who skipped home. Paolo Garbisi’s extras tore up one fairytale script and underlined another that few could have predicted. This is Italy’s first win over Wales after 16 defeats and their first ever in Cardiff. They hadn’t won a Six Nations game in seven years. The calls for them to be cancelled and replaced by the vaunted South African Springboks had grown to a clamour. Those voices have been silenced by a young team still a long way from its true potential. They started brightly and were 6-0 up after a penalty each from Garbisi and Padovani. Their aggression on the ground seemed to take Wales by surprise. It took the better part of half an hour for Wales to find their groove. A turnover in their own 22m was swiftly moved up field with Louis Rees-Zammit and Uilisi Halaholo leading the charge. Seconds later Taulupe Faletau found Owen Watkin’s run and the centre stepped the prop Pietro Ceccarelli to score. Welsh inaccuracy, though, kept Italy in the contest and two more penalties nudged the Azzurri 12-7 in front. The gap would have widened if Capuozzo had managed to dot down a loose ball following Garbisi’s cross-kick to Montanna Ioane. But Italy were good value for their first half-time lead in the tournament since 2019. Wales were sluggish from the restart and needed a superb tackle from Josh Adams to deny Ioane a try in the left corner. That seemed to spook the home side with Biggar attacking the line with greater ambition. He demonstrated his intent by poking a kickable penalty out for touch on 50 minutes. It proved the right decision as Dewi Lake bulldozed over from the resulting maul. Biggar’s extras meant the lead changed hands for the fourth time. It changed again shortly after when Capuozzo and Ioane engineered a counter from inside their try area. Another penalty on the ground 80m away gave Garbisi an easy three points. Wales looked rudderless for so much of this contest. An inability to win the physical battle at the gain line compounded a lack of creativity in midfield. If they were to get back in it they’d need an unlikely touch of class. It came from Josh Adams. Much maligned after his failed test at centre against Ireland, he gathered a pass above his head on 69 minutes with his heels touching the left wing. He stepped inside with little on offer. He stepped again and again and soon had nothing but space as a barrier between him and the line. It was a moment unbefitting a flat display but, nonetheless, the Italians seemed to have lost their zeal. But Capuozzo would have the final say. A product of a fruitful under-20 programme, he was the standout among a cluster of young players who might yet change the narrative of Italian rugby. Garbisi is 21. Michele Lamaro, the captain, is 23. It will be little consolation to two Welsh greats or those who adore them, but this result is a shot in the arm for the global game.",Sport/Sport,Padovani’s late try gives Italy historic Six Nations win against turgid Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/wales-italy-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report
