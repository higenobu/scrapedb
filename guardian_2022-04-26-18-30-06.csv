4/26/2022,"Angela Rayner has revealed she begged the Mail on Sunday not to run a story claiming a Conservative MP compared her to the character in Basic Instinct, saying the “classist” comments in the piece were disparaging about working-class people. Labour’s deputy leader said she had been horrified at the story, which she had had to explain to her teenage sons. Recalling when the MoS first told her it was running the story, she said she told them: “This is disgusting. It’s completely untrue. Please don’t run a story like that … I was with my teenage sons … trying to prepare my children for seeing things online. They don’t want to see their mum portrayed that way and I felt really down about that.” Speaking on ITV’s Lorraine, she said she wanted to be “defiant” in the face of sexist attacks but said she had also decided to wear a trouser suit for the interview in order not to be accused of anything further. “I want to be defiant because I don’t think that women should be told how to dress but I didn’t want to distract from the fact that actually it’s not about my legs.” Rayner said she was horrified that the story might reflect the public’s view of her at the dispatch box, where she has stood in for the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, at prime minister’s questions in the Commons against Boris Johnson. “I just thought, is that what people expect and think about what I do? All I worry about when I’m at the dispatch box is doing a good job and being able to do justice to my constituents and the work that I’m doing. So I was just really crestfallen.” She said she had been heartened by the response from the public and all political parties. Johnson tweeted a condemnation of the piece, which quoted an MP saying Rayner could not compete with Johnson’s Oxford Union debating skills. “I felt really fearful of the story coming out thinking, that’s what people think of me,” she said. “Actually, the overwhelming response has been that it’s been terrible that they even printed something like that.” The Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who met Rayner on Monday, has called the Mail on Sunday editor, David Dillon, to a meeting. The Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, the chair of the women and equalities committee, has written to Hoyle asking him to consider revoking the Commons pass of the piece’s author, Glen Owen. Rayner said the piece, which mentioned her teenage pregnancy and time as a care worker, was “steeped in classism” that often put women off achieving more in their careers. “They talk about my background because I had a child when I was young as if to say I’m promiscuous, that was the insinuation. It was quite offensive for people of my background,” she said. She said she wanted other women from the same kinds of background to feel empowered about achieving more. “I don’t want them thinking they’re not worthwhile because they speak with an accent or they’ve had children when they were young, or they might be single parents now … [mean] they should be ashamed of who they are,” she said. “They should be confident of who they are, and they should be proud of their background and be able to speak about it. I’ll never stop speaking about mine because I’m proud of where I’ve come from.” “A lot of women say to me when they see me, ‘Angie, you’ve inspired me, because I can see myself in you, you speak the way i speak’. They see me and they see themselves and that’s the biggest compliment that someone can ever pay me.”",News/Politics,Angela Rayner: ‘I begged Mail on Sunday not to publish Basic Instinct story’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/26/angela-rayner-i-begged-mail-on-sunday-not-to-publish-basic-instinct-story
4/26/2022,"Shoppers have begun to stockpile some essentials such as cooking oil as grocery price inflation hits it highest level in more than a decade in April. Supermarket shoppers were preparing for limited availability of some goods along with higher prices, as the war in Ukraine increased public awareness of supply pressures and prices rose according to the latest survey by the market analyst Kantar. Cooking oil sales increased 17% in April, with sunflower oil – Britain’s most popular choice for frying – up 27% and vegetable oil sales up 40%. Grocery prices rose 5.9% in the three months to 17 April compared with the same period a year earlier, the highest level since December 2011 and the latest sign that household budgets are coming under mounting pressure from the cost of living crisis. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said the average household is facing potential grocery price increases totalling £271 a year. “A lot of this is going on non-discretionary, everyday essentials which will prove difficult to cut back on as budgets are squeezed. We’re seeing a clear flight to value as shoppers watch their pennies,” McKevitt said. “Last weekend several supermarkets introduced restrictions on cooking oil purchases as concerned consumers filled up their cupboards.” Retailers have begun to react to demand with Tesco introducing a limit of three bottles of oil a customer last week after Morrisons and Waitrose limited purchases to two a person. Overall, however, sales of items to consume at home fell back as workplaces, cafes and restaurants reopened. Only Aldi and Lidl increased sales – taking their joint share of the market to 15.4% compared with 5.5% a decade ago – as more than 1 million more shoppers sought a way to offset rising prices by visiting one of the discounters. Aldi’s sales rose by more than 4% to help reach its highest share of the market ever at 8.8% as the German business continues to gain ground on the UK’s fourth biggest supermarket chain, Morrisons. Lidl confirmed its position as the sixth biggest chain with 6.6% of the market ahead of the Co-op. Tesco was the only other retailer to gain market share over the period, growing by 0.3 percentage points to hold 27.3% of total grocery sales despite its sales falling by nearly 5%. Online grocery sales were down by almost 15% compared with 2021 as confidence in heading out to stores returned and fewer people were working from home and so able to accept deliveries easily. in its latest bid for expansion, Lidl is offering a finder’s fee to members of the public who successfully identify suitable sites new sites. The company, which says it is seeking sites in 13 British cities including Bristol, Derby, Liverpool, Manchester and London, is offering either 1.5% of the total freehold purchase price or 10% of the first year’s rent for leaseholds, equivalent to £22,500 for a completed £1.5m site purchase.",News/Business,UK shoppers stockpile cooking oil and other essentials as prices soar,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/26/uk-stockpile-cooking-oil-and-other-essentials-prices-sunflower-oil-shortage
4/26/2022,"Huge numbers of us have been cancelling subscriptions to streaming TV, thanks to the end of lockdown and a rise in the cost of living, as well as price hikes for some of the services. In Britain, more than 1.5m video-on-demand accounts were cancelled in the first three months of 2022, according to the market research firm Kantar, while Netflix has lost 200,000 customers globally and expects to shed millions more. The good news is that there’s plenty of high-quality TV that can be watched for free. Here are 15 great shows that you won’t need to fork out for. Daisy Haggard’s comedy-drama about an ex-convict returning to her small home town after an 18-year sentence neatly subverts the coming-of-age story. Haggard’s Miri Matteson, sent to jail as a teenager, returns as an adult only to find herself forced to relive all the awkward horrors of her youth. As she attempts to adapt to modern life, she is shunned by the local community, with darkly comic results. Over two series we discover the nature of Matteson’s wrongdoing, as Haggard veers from comedy to tear-jerking pathos. An eminently bingeable watch, but one that is as unsettling as it is enticing. ITV does chilling drama very well. In fact, the channel’s primetime schedules seem to be filled with nothing but the tales of murderous villains and the coppers charged with hunting them down. Three-parter Des is one of the very best of the recent bunch. David Tennant gives a shockingly convincing performance as the real-life Scottish serial killer Dennis Nilsen, who was arrested in 1983 when a drain blockage led to the discovery of his victims’ remains. It is a finely wrought work, imbuing every scene with Nilsen’s calculated evil. Twenty years after the release of Gurinder Chadha’s seminal film Bend It Like Beckham, authentic British Asian representation is sorely lacking on mainstream film and TV. Enter Nida Manzoor’s sitcom about an all-female Muslim punk band’s quest to find a new guitarist. Despite this unlikely premise, the six episodes successfully explore the nuances of interracial difference, while tracing the importance of fellowship and friendship in marginalised communities. A prime example of commissioning that reflects the diverse talent of the UK. Joe Pera’s mockumentary series follows the comic as he plays a fictional version of himself narrating his everyday activities – going for breakfast, wandering through New York, simply sitting on a chair … Hidden in the mundanity are sweet entreaties for patience with our fellow humans and an encouragement to stop and take enjoyment in the simpler things in life. Watch a few episodes and feel the warming sense of peace as you escape the pressures of the real world. Graham Norton, eat your heart out. Comic Eric Andre’s talkshow has been taking the concept of chatting with celebrity guests to uncomfortable – and often dangerous – extremes ever since it premiered in 2012. The joy of Andre’s show often comes from the fact that his B-list guests usually have no idea what they are letting themselves in for. Cue Andre, stripping and destroying his flimsy sets while asking Mel B whether Margaret Thatcher had “girl power”. In the Shooting Stars and Between Two Ferns stable of surrealist celebrity fun. The BBC’s long-running strand of feature documentaries has rarely faltered. The highlight of its latest series is The Earth Is a Blue Orange – a heart-rending and unfortunately timely documentary about a Ukrainian family in the Donbas region as they live under siege in 2019. As a method of coping amid the chaos, single mother Anna and her four children decide to construct and edit a film about their lives, producing a quietly domestic portrayal of enduring human connection in the face of war. One of Sharon Horgan’s finest feats, the entire box set of this 2006 cult classic is available to stream on iPlayer. Horgan plays Donna, a 29-year-old office worker who decides to break off her engagement to fiance Karl and embark on a new life of singledom with her pals Karen (Tanya Franks) and Louise (Rebekah Staton). Chaos, of course, ensues, producing a masterclass in human messiness that makes subsequent similar shows such as Fleabag seem tame. Although Pulling was unexpectedly cancelled after only two series, its 13 episodes are a highpoint in British comedic writing from Horgan and Dennis Kelly – a peak they failed to climb again with their underwhelming 2021 lockdown film Together. A new format from BBC Four, in this four-part series an actor gives a dramatic reading of a classic book, directed by an upcoming talent from the organisation’s New Creatives scheme. The result perfectly straddles the line between soothing background viewing and engrossing audio book. The first instalment features actor Danielle Vitalis giving a patois-laden version of Sam Selvon’s tale of the Windrush generation, The Lonely Londoners, while interspersing archive footage from the book’s 1950s setting. It is a perfect example of the BBC’s strengths – at turns informative and entertaining while revitalising existing material for new audiences. This glitzy, all-south-Asian cast adaptation of Vikram Seth’s mammoth tale of partition-era India seemed to sink without a trace when it aired in 2020. Set amid the vibrance and turmoil of mid-century India, the show is well worth revisiting for its performances. Bollywood newcomer Tanya Maniktala plays the lead, Lata, with a fresh-faced sense of curiosity and growing concern, while Indian film veteran Tabu relishes the sensuality of older courtesan Saeeda Bai. The theme of jilted romance may be tried and tested but it is depicted with a delicacy that lends more modern nuance. David Nicholls has a gift for writing that zips while evoking tears of laughter and sadness. In the hands of actors Tom Hollander and Saskia Reeves, this 2020 adaptation of his novel, recounting the last-ditch attempt of a middle-aged couple to salvage their relationship, is an escapist wonder. It should have attracted far more fanfare when it aired in September 2020, but its European locations, bumbling sense of humour and canny performances hold up two years later. At the very least, it’s perfect holiday inspiration. Steve McQueen’s Small Axe series of films about the legacy of the Windrush generation in the UK may have rightfully received the lion’s share of the headlines when it came out in December 2020, but this standalone film from earlier in the year is equally worth your attention. The real-life drama focuses on the story of Anthony Bryan, who found himself classified as an illegal immigrant after 50 years living in the UK. By focusing on a single person’s story, the film – and Patrick Robinson’s humane portrayal of Bryan – exposes the nonsensical cruelty of the government’s hostile environment policies. If Normal People was your lockdown go-to and the wait for the new adaptation of Conversation With Friends is too much to bear, this overlooked tale of a throuple’s relationship is a must-watch. As a couple struggle to make ends meet in London and open up their flat to a lodger, the series explores how the trio slowly become closer than just friends. The deft performances by the two female leads, Ariane Labed and Thalissa Teixeira, anchor the show in more than just its sexual frisson, making it a reflection on millennial relationships under financial pressures. Though overshadowed by contemporaneous sitcoms such as Peep Show and The Office, Phil Bowker’s heavily improvised 2009 sitcom about the employees of a suburban mobile phone shop stands up as one of the finest and most chaotic comedies this country has produced. Soundtracked by a frenetic mix of jungle, drum’n’bass and reggae, the ensemble show trades in anarchy – from the ranting monologues of Kayvan Novak’s regional manager, Razz Prince, to the masterful double act of Jerwayne and Ashley – and its surrealism always produces gags that land. One for the kids, this charming storytelling series stars Don Warrington as the grandfather aiming to make sense of the world for his pint-sized audience. Each 15-minute episode tackles a new question – from how aeroplanes fly to why the sea is salty and why the world is round – in a gentle narrative that never feels lecturing. Also worthy of a shoutout is CBeebies’ fantastic My World Kitchen, featuring recipes from young cooks celebrating their heritage. Sometimes trashy TV is all you need, and for some reason Australia does it best when it comes to chaos and feverish levels of onscreen backstabbing. Series nine of this Aussie spin-off of the show that challenges singletons to – you guessed it – get married without having dated each other is available to stream on All 4. Behold as, over the course of two months, couples are paired off in the hope that their attachment styles will keep them together for the rest of their lives.

4/26/2022,"Heathrow airport has warned it expects a drop-off in passenger numbers after a summer surge, with airlines already cancelling services into the autumn amid higher fuel costs, war in Ukraine and an expected fourth Covid wave. The airport’s total pandemic losses have topped £4bn, but passenger numbers have started to recover after the UK government lifted travel restrictions. Heathrow said 9.7 million passengers passed through the airport in the first three months of the year, 8 million more than a year earlier, with many heading to destinations in North America and Europe. January and February were much weaker than expected because of travel restrictions imposed after the Omicron variant emerged, while March passenger numbers rose to the highest since the start of the pandemic, after the unexpectedly rapid lifting of all UK travel restrictions on 18 March. The airport made a £223m adjusted loss before tax in the first three months of the year, compared with £329m the same time last year. The group expects to remain loss-making this year, and to not pay any dividends to shareholders. However, Heathrow is expecting more passengers this year than previously, as people are taking advantage of removed UK travel restrictions and redeeming travel vouchers accrued during the pandemic for weekend breaks and during school holidays. The airport raised its 2022 passenger forecast from 45.5 million to 52.8m, which means a return to 65% of pre-pandemic traffic. “Summer has come early,” said John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive, on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, but he added: “We have a long way to go to come out of this.” He warned that demand remains very volatile, and travel is expected to drop sharply after the summer. “We are already seeing airlines cancelling services into the autumn and the realities of higher fuel costs, lower GDP growth, the war in Ukraine and the ongoing pandemic will drag on demand. We are still in a pandemic with many markets still closed, nearly 80% with testing and vaccination requirements and another variant of concern could see the return of UK travel restrictions.” Passengers face a 2% increase in ticket prices, which Holland-Kaye described as “very affordable,” after the Civil Aviation Authority approved a 37% rise in landing charges in December. Heathrow had called for even higher charges to help recoup losses caused by the pandemic, and was accused of “gouging” its customers by Willie Walsh, the former IAG boss who leads the global airline body Iata. The Heathrow boss rejected suggestions that the airport should have done more to avoid large queues during busy times, saying it had scaled up operations at the end of last year. The airport has recruited more than 1,000 new security officers and will open terminal 4 by July, and said 95% of passengers passed through security within five minutes during the busy Easter getaway. However, it admitted that a shortage in ground handlers and worker absence because of Covid had affected departure punctuality.",News/UK news,Heathrow’s Covid losses top £4bn as autumn lull looms,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/26/heathrow-covid-losses-cancel-flights-fuel-costs-ukraine-war
4/26/2022,"They may be magically delicious, but this week Lucky Charms are in the spotlight for a very different reason. According to a mountain of consumer claims, the cereal is causing an array of gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and diarrhea. The US Food and Drug Administration says it has received “hundreds” of complaints about the cereal this year. The food safety site iwaspoisoned.com, which lets consumers warn others when they believe a product has sickened them, paints an even more alarming picture, citing 4,500 reports of illness. “I never take off from work but had to take two sick days because I was so ill. I honestly thought I would die,” wrote one poster. “It robbed me of a week of my life and my love for cereal as we have not had any since.” But what’s really going on? Food safety lawyers suggest that this case may say more about human nature than about hearts, moons and horseshoes. The FDA and General Mills, maker of the cereal, say in statements that they are investigating the case. General Mills says it has found no evidence of illness linked to the cereal, and experts are hesitant to make assumptions. William Marler, a lawyer who has been at the center of food safety battles for decades, isn’t convinced that the cereal is to blame for the reported illnesses. “Correlation is not necessarily causation,” he wrote in an email to the Guardian, echoing comments by colleagues elsewhere. He noted the common experience of Googling a handful of symptoms and learning that the itch on your arm is almost definitely proof of a fatal illness. Something similar may be happening here, Marler suggests. “People try to connect the dots between something that’s happening and something that’s known, but the connection may not necessarily be accurate,” he said in a phone interview. “There are hundreds of thousands of people today in the United States that are having vomiting and diarrhea, from a bunch of different causes. And it also may be happening that some of those thousandsof people also happen to eat Lucky Charms. And now they’re seeing it in the news and they’re going: ‘Hey, wait a second. I had diarrhea a week ago, and I ate Lucky Charms. Therefore, it had to be the Lucky Charms.’” In some cases, many of the complainants may be right about the link between their symptoms and a particular food product – while many others are wrong about the same thing. He describes a 2007 case in which several hundred people got sick from salmonella detected in Peter Pan peanut butter jars. “But we got 5,000 phone calls … And the vast majority of them were people who go, ‘Well, no, I didn’t have any medical treatment,’” he said. “You knew that there was a clear outbreak link to a product. But then you still had thousands of people presuming that they got sick from eating the product. And they probably did not.” That’s not at all to suggest that people are making up their symptoms or trying to “game the system” – just that it’s very challenging to ascertain the source. “That’s why foodborne illness cases are sometimes really, really difficult to figure out,” he said. Without “solid epidemiological evidence – you have stool culture, you have purchase history, you have the product testing positive, you have, unfortunately, lots of people getting sick, so you can tell the common denominator of what it is – it’s kind of hard to put it together.” And of course, some people posting online about a connection between their symptoms and a source are absolutely right, and social media such as iwaspoisoned.com can be a useful tool for getting to the root of a problem. Marler once got a call from a customer saying she’d gotten salmonella from a Los Angeles restaurant and posted about it on Yelp – where dozens of others had said the same thing on the same day. “Ultimately, the Yelp review was correct,” he said. “It was an early warning system for getting the health department to act.” As for the Lucky Charms, Marler says he’d like to see some more hard evidence – testing of products, clear diagnoses of customers’ illnesses – to learn more. Such illnesses aren’t unheard of; in 2018, Kellogg’s Honey Smacks – the ones with the frog on the box – were associated with a salmonella outbreak that hospitalized 34 people, according to the CDC. Kellogg’s recalled the cereal that June. And last year, a Los Angeles comedian made waves online when he claimed to have discovered shrimp tails in his Cinnamon Toast Crunch, leading to a very public exchange with General Mills. In the meantime, some customers will be wary of Lucky Charms, which celebrates its 60th birthday in 2024. As another post said: “I used to eat Lucky Charms all of the time, right before bed. Never again.”",Lifestyle/Food,Magically suspicious: why are thousands claiming sickness after eating Lucky Charms?,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/26/lucky-charms-cereal-illness-claims-fda
4/26/2022,"You can sort of tell what kind of film writer-director-co-star Savvas D Michael thought he was making, given the lofty references to Homer’s Iliad in the plotting, Martin Scorsese movies in the dialogue, and Guy Ritchie in the casting – given the presence here of Vinnie Jones in a cameo role. However, the result is an intensely irritating hot mess, a London petty criminal story set in the Greek Cypriot community that’s offensive, self-indulgent and stupid. The title refers to a private club of the same name, run by one Plato Andinos (Andreas Karras), a small-time big shot who likes to throw parties with strippers for his mates, and preaches homophobia and sexism at home to his kids. His wife, Helen (Marina Sirtis, from Star Trek Generations) puts up with it all because she gets knockoff designer handbags and a tacky house that makes the cribs in The Only Way Is Essex look like items from Architectural Digest. But Plato’s home life is only peripheral to the story, which mostly revolves around the exploits and hijinks of him and his crew, a motley selection of knaves, one of whom is a supposedly handsome and supposedly unbeatable scrapper named Achilles (played by Michael himself). Stung when his romantic overtures are rejected by local beauty-cum-poker-hustler Lola (Lois Brabin-Platt, whose display of sass represents one of the film’s few amusements), Achilles goes into a sulk in Homeric fashion. This causes considerable distress in particular to Achilles’ No 1 fan, Anthony (Jamie Crew), seemingly also expected to be considered an object of pity given Crew’s manic and mannered display of verbal diarrhoea, delivered with a speech impediment and jerky movements. Perhaps Anthony is the character for whom we’re supposed to feel sorry. That said, hardly anyone is even vaguely likable here, which needn’t necessarily have been a drawback, but they should at least be in some way interesting. No such luck.

4/26/2022,"The actor Tracy-Ann Oberman has apologised and paid “substantial damages” to a politician and academic who she falsely accused of antisemitism. Oberman, whose credits include EastEnders, Friday Night Dinner, It’s A Sin and Ridley Road and who appeared on Celebrity Bake-Off last week, tweeted that Dr Philip Proudfoot, the founder of the Northern Independence party (NIP), had a “Jew block list”. Proudfoot, an anthropologist and Middle East specialist, had used Twitter block chain, a tool that blocks all Twitter users following a blocked account, in response to being targeted by anonymous troll accounts attacking him for his pro-Palestinian views. Oberman posted an apology on Twitter on Tuesday morning. She said Proudfoot had contacted her the day after she posted the offending tweet to explain that he had blocked all followers of an account she followed because he believed it was trolling and harassing him. She told her more than 100,000 followers: “I accept that Dr Proudfoot has at no time had a Jew block list and apologise for stating otherwise. I made a mistake and appreciate that my comments were hurtful. I have therefore deleted my tweet, agreed to pay substantial damages and legal costs.” The level of damages has not been disclosed. Proudfoot, a research fellow at the Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University, founded the leftwing NIP in October 2020. On 4 April last year, Oberman, a critic of Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of antisemitism complaints while he was Labour leader, tweeted: “So a man called @PhilipProudfoot of @FreeNorthNow has a Jew block list. I’ve been out of the twitter politics loop for a few months but is this party continuation Corbyn? Seems like it. And will it end up the same way? Seems like it. Good luck all.” Responding to the settlement of his libel claim, Proudfoot said: “I am a humanitarian researcher. I’ve seen the horrors of war in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. It is for this reason I am a supporter of the struggle for human rights in Palestine. And it is for this reason I am appalled and disgusted by antisemitism, and all forms of prejudice.” His solicitor, Zillur Rahman, said: “Antisemitism is a serious problem in our society and it is unfortunate that some people like Philip, who show solidarity with the Palestinians in their struggle for freedom from Israel’s oppression, have been falsely accused of antisemitism, which can have a chilling effect on free speech against injustices and human rights violations.”",News/News,Tracy-Ann Oberman pays ‘substantial damages’ for antisemitism claims,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/26/tracy-ann-oberman-pays-substantial-damages-antisemitism-claims-twitter
4/26/2022,"Humans extract 50bn tonnes of sand and gravel every year, according to UN research, enough to build a wall 27 metres high by 27 metres wide around the planet. Sand is the most-exploited resource after water. But unlike water, it is not recognised as a key strategic resource by governments and industry, something, the UN says, that must change and fast.The UN report makes the case for greater monitoring of extraction and supply chains, measures to compensate for the associated loss of animal and plant species as well as the uneven social and economic impacts of sand mining. Given the extent and growing awareness of human reliance on sand for economic development in industries, ranging from construction to IT manufacturing and a number of other booming sectors, the researchers said a fundamental shift in the understanding and valuation of sand was urgently needed.“If our entire development depends on sand, it should be recognised as a strategic material,” said Pascal Peduzzi, director of the Global Resource Information Database of the UN Environment Programme and lead author of the report. Sand extraction takes a number of different forms, from the dredging of lakes and rivers to various kinds of land mining and the crushing of rock, and is carried out by both large firms and individuals with rudimentary tools. The current rate of activity far outstrips that at which naturally occurring sand reserves can be replenished.An international standard on extraction is needed, the report said, if the material is to be regulated effectively and governed equitably. Among its recommendations are the establishment of legal frameworks for mineral ownership of aggregates.“The aim is to shift the focus on to sand as a commodity and a material that should be treated in the same light as other mineral commodities – be that mineral deposits, water, oil or gas,” said Dr Chris Hackney, a researcher at Newcastle University and another of the report’s authors.“These are all regulated from the local to national levels, operating within standardised international frameworks. That’s completely lacking at the moment for sand and aggregates.”A lack of governance has up to now created an informational black hole around the procurement and use of sand. The Global Aggregates Information Network estimated aggregates production rose 4.9% in the last year from 42.2bn tonnes in 2020 to 44.3bn tonnes in 2021. But the UN report noted: “Globally, the sand supply base is not known and only aggregate production estimates are available.”Meanwhile, sand extraction continues to drive biodiversity loss, exacerbates flood risk in removing natural barriers to storm surge such as dunes, affects the livelihoods of fishing communities and even fuel conflict. Its end uses are also some of the biggest industrial contributors to the climate crisis, with recent estimates suggesting the concrete sector, if it were measured as a country, would have the third-highest carbon emissions in the world.Emerging research suggests more than 1,000 threatened “red list” species of animals and plants are affected by sand and gravel extraction – with that figure thought to extend to 24,000 species overall.Yet the lack of formal recognition means sand “falls between the cracks” of policy and legislative frameworks in many countries, with its impacts hard to grasp for the consumer and previously little onus on or imperative for governing bodies to act, said Kiran Pereira, a researcher and author of Sand Stories: Surprising truths about the global sand crisis and the quest for sustainable solutions.“Personally, I think it is difficult to understand the scale of extraction in general,” said Pereira, who also contributed to the UN report. “However, this resource is not consumed evenly,” she added, citing the report’s recommendations for reuse of existing construction products, alongside incorporation of alternative construction materials and practices in developed countries.The appetite for sand is expected to grow considerably over coming years, with the global population predicted to reach nearly 10 billion before 2050, by which time it is thought about 70% of people in the world will live in urban areas.A standards vacuum also has implications for the human cost of sand mining in parts of the world where governance and oversight is weak and the material is in high demand. More than 400 people in India – including government officials – are thought to have died in violence and accidents related to sand mining since 2020.In Vietnam’s Mekong delta, which is normally subject to regulation, illegal sand extraction has reportedly increased during the pandemic, with the resources of authorities stretched and their priorities elsewhere. The demand for aggregates is again soaring, as governments around the world pursue Covid recovery strategies anchored in construction-led growth. Hackney said standardisation would assist efforts to establish the extent of sand extraction that was made up by illegal and non-legal practices, which have up to now been complicated by a number of factors – , and act as a deterrent.“Having those standards across the board, the frameworks and the resources for agencies at various levels to enforce them would certainly go some way to achieving this,” he said.“This needs to come in tandem with improved monitoring of supply chains and scrutiny of links between governments, industries and other interests involved. But, together with that, the kind of top-down regulation we recommend could make quite a break in those chains.“The whole package of these principles would make this activity less appealing and worthwhile for actors participating in it currently.”",News/Environment,"50bn tonnes of sand and gravel extracted each year, finds UN study",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/26/50bn-tonnes-of-sand-and-gravel-extracted-each-year-finds-un-study
4/26/2022,"The UK backs Ukrainian troops carrying out strikes in Russian territory, the armed forces minister has said, calling it “not necessarily a problem” if Ukraine uses weapons donated by Britain. James Heappey said the UK believed it was “completely legitimate” for Ukraine to identify targets in Russia in order to disrupt attacks on Ukraine. “Of course we do. The fact is that Ukraine was a sovereign country that was living peacefully within its owner borders and then another country decided to violate those borders and bring 130,000 troops across into their country,” he told Times Radio. “That started a war between Ukraine and Russia, and in war Ukraine needs to strike into its opponent’s depth to attack its logistics lines, its fuel supplies, its ammunition depots, and that’s part of it.” He added that it was “completely legitimate for Ukraine to be targeting in Russia’s depth in order to disrupt the logistics that if they weren’t disrupted would directly contribute to death and carnage on Ukrainian soil”. He said it was “not necessarily a problem” if British-donated weapons were used to hit sites on Russian soil after accepting that weapons allies were supplying to Ukraine had the range to be used over borders. “There are lots of countries around the world that operate kit that they have imported from other countries. When those bits of kit are used we tend not to blame [the country] that manufactured it, you blame the country that fired it.” Heappey said there was “every chance” the Ukrainians would be able to repel the Russian forces, a more optimistic tone than struck by Boris Johnson in India last week. The prime minister said that a war of attrition in Ukraine meant Russia could grind out an eventual victory and “the sad thing is that that is a realistic possibility”. Heappey said that in the east of the country the conflict would be between two forces that were “much more evenly balanced, where the Ukrainians have the advantage of defensive positions that have been dug in and prepared over the last eight years and that’s going to make it an extraordinarily difficult nut for the Russians to crack”. “And with all the support that the Ukrainians are getting from around the world, there’s every chance the Ukrainians can see them off,” he told Sky. Speaking earlier on the BBC, Heappey said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was determined to claim some kind of victory before the 9 May victory parade, a time pressure he said would force errors by the Russians. He said commanders would know it was “militarily unsound” to attempt to keep to a set date. “It is absolute folly to launch an offensive before you’ve massed all of your combat power and that they’re giving away whatever advantage they may have won and there’s been incredibly bad weather in the Donbas over the last week or two, which means the ground is not conducive right now to the manoeuvre of heavy army,” Heappey said. “Putin’s political pressure and the hubris that he’s shown, his desire to stand there on the steps of the Kremlin on 9 May and be a hero, means that thousands of Russian lives are going to be lost and the Russians are going to hand over the numerical advantage that they should have.”",News/Politics,Minister backs Ukraine carrying out Russia strikes with British weapons,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/26/britain-backs-ukraine-carrying-out-strikes-in-russia-says-minister
4/26/2022,"Marcel Hug was named World Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability by Laureus on Sunday, and he is enjoying the feeling. “For me it’s the most important award we can win in sport,” he says, “so I’m very happy and proud to have it.” The Laureus World Sport Awards are international prizes selected each year by a tiny electorate of 71 people. Each of them are former winners – the best of the sporting best – and any success therefore shows the level of respect with which athletes are held by their peers. That Hug should be the winner of this year’s award – his fourth nomination and second success – should come as no surprise. The “Silver Bullet”, as the Swiss wheelchair racer is known due to his distinctive metallic helmet, dominated the Paralympic Games in Tokyo. He won four gold medals in the T54 classification, at 800m, 1500m and 5,000m as well as the marathon, and set world and Paralympic records in the process. “I think it is the top of my career,” Hug says, reflecting on what he describes as a “crazy” year. “Of course it was challenging to come to Tokyo, because we had not a lot of competitions. I really didn’t know where I was standing compared with my competitors. So to win that first gold in the 5,000m came as huge relief, and for the next races I was full of confidence.” It was in the heats of the 5,000m that Hug finished nearly a minute clear of ParalympicGB’s David Weir, a performance that signalled the beginning of the very end of their fierce rivalry, one that stretches back to London 2012. Hug may have eventually slayed the “Weirwolf”, but he says the two remain cordial. He got a text from the Scot to congratulate him on his award, plus the two world records in the 5,000m Hug has already recorded this year. “The rivalry with David is really important to me and it means a lot,” Hug says. “We have been competing together for so many years and being great rivals means we pushed each other to our limits and made ourselves stronger. I think he was also a very important person for the London Paralympics. London 2012 was a very important games for para-sport, and to have David as a multiple winner there gave us an extra boost.” Hug is gracious in reflecting Weir’s status as an icon in para-sport, and says it had never occurred to him to reflect on his own legacy until he completed his events at Tokyo last year. “After that, everything was different. After the Paralympics I was reflecting on my future, but I was also thinking ‘what is my legacy in this sport’? Now I think for the years that I am still in racing, I hope that I have more of an impact. I really hope so.” Hug says he has no idea of what he will do once he retires, but at the age of 35 that consideration is becoming real. He has adjusted his sporting ambitions, switching from plans that were built around four-year Paralympic cycles to those that last only 12 months. “It took me a long time to realise what happened in that crazy season last year,” he says, “Now I want to use [the time] to feel how motivated I am and how I want to continue. From now on, I take it year by year.” Alongside his record of success, Hug will also leave a legacy through the way he has pushed development of technology in para-sport. It was his racing chair, designed by a consortium of engineering teams including the Formula One company Sauber and debuting in Tokyo, that Weir described as “a Ferrari of a chair”. It sparked debate over the possibility of a technological divide in a sporting world that was professionalising at rapid speed. Hug says he understands such concerns, but believes they are far outweighed by the benefits. “I totally understand there are lots of discussions about materials, and particularly my wheelchair, and there are people saying it is not fair,” Hug says. “My point of view is that we are also a professional sport, that we should try to develop and that this includes the materials. I hope my chair helps to bring our sport a little bit forward, to also motivate other brands of racing wheelchairs to develop their chairs. I absolutely hope it is seen in the same way as in a non-disabled sport, like cycling or motorsports.” He may not have worked out for himself his legacy in para-sport, but an increased professionalism might well be part of it. The dedication he has shown to his sport has not only led to great success but it has pushed the boundaries, just as Weir’s did too. “I really hope that we can continue our way to become more professional, make more tour events, get more athletes coming in to our sport,” Hug says, looking forward. “But I think we are in a good way. There is more interest in para-sport now than when I started many years ago. I think we should continue in that way.”",Sport/Sport,Marcel Hug: ‘The rivalry with David Weir is really important to me’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/26/marcel-hug-para-sport-laureus-david-weir-wheelchair-racing
4/26/2022,"Three endangered Sumatran tigers have been found dead after being caught in traps on Indonesia’s Sumatra island. One female tiger was found dead, her head almost severed and a snare still stuck in her leg, near a palm oil plantation in Indonesia’s East Aceh district on Sunday. Five hundred metres away, the bodies of a male and female tiger were also found, both with leg injuries, according to local police chief Hendra Sukmana. An autopsy is under way to determine the causes of the deaths, said Agus Arianto, who heads the conservation agency in Aceh, adding that several traps similar to ones used to capture wild boar on farms were found in the area around the dead tigers. The species was classified as critically endangered in 2008 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, when its population was estimated at fewer than 680. Now, it is the most critically endangered tiger species in the world, with its numbers dwindling below 400. Authorities have called the recent deaths a setback to the species. “We strongly condemned this incident,” Arianto said in a statement. Indonesian authorities have also urged plantation companies and the public to stop setting snares in forest areas, home to wild animals such as tigers, rhinos, elephants and orangutans – many of which are rare. Poaching for profit, and a jungle habitat shrinking at the hands of oil palm plantations and illegal logging, is putting Sumatran tigers among other species under increasing risk. A female tiger was found dead in a snare trap in October last year, in the Bengkalis district’s Bukit Batu wildlife reserve. Just two months earlier, two cubs and an adult tiger were found dead in a forested region for tiger conservation in Aceh and North Sumatra provinces, known as the Leuser Ecosystem Area. Four men were also arrested last June for allegedly catching a tiger in a snare trap and selling its remains. Sumatran tigers are not the only species to have been killed by traps. A baby elephant died after losing half her trunk to a trap set by poachers in November last year. Intentionally killing protected animals is illegal and offenders can face up to five years in prison and a fine of 100m rupiah (almost $7,000) under Indonesia’s Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystems law.",News/World news,Three endangered Sumatran tigers found dead in traps in Indonesia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/three-endangered-sumatran-tigers-found-dead-in-traps-in-indonesia
