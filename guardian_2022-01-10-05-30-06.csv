1/10/2022,"One of the televisual joys I most remember from childhood was when a programme – often a nature documentary, but sometimes a few seconds on Sesame Street or a Tomorrow’s World demonstration of new technology – would show a flower unfolding with time-lapse photography. It was always sudden, always fleeting, and of course there weren’t even any recording buttons – let alone live pausing and rewinding facilities – that you could quickly press in order to capture and relive the delight. It was ever ephemeral, and I could never get enough. Until now, with the latest gift from David Attenborough and his endlessly patient and dedicated team of camera operators (to whom a now traditional 10-minute coda is again devoted), The Green Planet (BBC One). The new five-part series presented by the veteran naturalist (though “veteran” hardly seems enough any more – Attenborough has now been making gobsmacking documentaries for two-thirds of the BBC’s entire broadcasting history) is about plants. Those that spring up in their tropical millions in the rainforests, those that endure in snowy wastelands, those who wrest life from the desiccated jaws of death in the desert, those that anchor themselves in rivers and streams – all of them and their cyclical splendours are gathered together for our awed delectation.  We begin with those rainforests. We watch seedlings sprout – that fresh inimitable green, bright against the brown-leaved forest floor – in the wake of a fallen tree, followed apparent seconds later by vines and their wagging, opportunistic tendrils searching for support. We are shown balsa tree blossoms filling and refilling with nectar seven times in a night to attract the pollinators they need, and the warty, blood-coloured petals of the gigantic, stinking rafflesia or “corpse flower” opening to welcome the carrion flies. We see the bioluminescent fungus known in Congo as “chimpanzee fire”, glowing in the dark as it releases its billions upon billions of spores into the air. And whenever you think there’s going to be a moment to catch all the breath you have gasped out in astonishment, they will hit you with something even more full of wonder – such as the leafcutter ants that are controlled by chemical signals sent out by a sprawling subterranean fungus and that bring back whatever type of leaf it commands, as well as excavating more space for their underlord as it grows. I mean – could we just take a moment, please? The fundamentals of evolution, competition, photosynthesis, parasitism and so on are lightly covered. I sometimes wonder if the anthropomorphic metaphors (about “battlefields” and so on, and the implied ascription of human motivations and considerations to the flora and especially fauna that appear on screen) annoy purists. But I am not one of them, and if I were I think I would try to take comfort in the trade-off made. What you lose in appreciation of blind forces, you gain in mass accessibility and the rousing of interest in millions of viewers – some of whom, at least, will then go on to study and understand everything as fully as you could wish. But maybe only because someone described a vine as “strangling” a monstera first. The extraordinary time-lapse photography – which is no longer a static thing but in the round – shows us seeds cracking, leaves unfurling, saplings straining greedily up towards the sky, as if an army of miniature drones had been hovering for months round every one. It is shown to be the BBC team’s development of work by the former US military engineer Chris Field. Enraptured by their nature docs and by time-lapse scenes in particular, he has spent his spare time for the past 10 years combining suitable cameras with motion controls, eventually allowing us to see things in a way they have never been seen before. There must be a documentary about him and people like him too someday, mustn’t there? At the same time, heartfelt thanks must be given to all. Assistant producer Louis Rummer-Downing described life eight days into what he did not yet know would be a two-week shoot for the leafcutter sequence, comprising shots from 7,000 different positions, which would last seconds on screen. “Wake up,” he said. “Film ants. Go to sleep. Dream of ants. Wake up …” At the other end of the scale, however, is the moment when an Underwood’s bat arrives to drink from a flower just as Attenborough is standing next to one, explaining the process. Attenborough’s face lights up and his gaze – after a quick flick sideways to check with the cameraman that all is well – fixes on the miracle in front of him with as much glee and reverence as ever. From mountain gorillas to tiny tropical bats, via more moments of fascination than there are fungal spores in the Congolese air – has ever a man known, done or shared so much?",Arts/Television & radio,"The Green Planet review – David Attenborough’s gobsmacking, awe-inspiring return",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/09/the-green-planet-review-david-attenboroughs-gob-smacking-awe-inspiring-return
1/10/2022,"Good morning. A bid to delay Novak Djokovic’s visa hearing has been rejected. Federal and state governments scramble as Covid cases spike. A momentous week of diplomacy gets under way in Europe as Ukraine’s fate hangs in the balance. A bid by the Morrison government to delay Novak Djokovic’s visa hearing by two days has been rejected by the federal circuit court. In an order, published on Sunday, judge Anthony Kelly rejected the move which would have delayed the hearing until Wednesday – after Tennis Australia’s stated deadline to include the world No 1 in the Australian Open draw. But legal experts have warned even with the hearing proceeding on Monday, there is no guarantee Djokovic could secure a court order restoring his visa in time to play. The Serbian star could also face his visa being revoked again on fresh grounds.  Omicron cases are spiking across Australia. On Sunday, New South Wales reported its deadliest day since the start of the pandemic with 16 deaths in the preceding 24 hours – eclipsing the highest daily totals of the Delta wave. Eight men and eight women in their 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s died. Federal and state governments are taking dramatic measures to cope. In both Queensland and NSW, new rules allow people with Covid-19 to leave isolation to work if their job is critical for food supply or emergency services. In Queensland, the start of the school year has been delayed by two weeks, the state government has announced. Meanwhile, federal health officials revealed isolation rules may soon change nationwide due to case numbers spiking. A momentous week of diplomacy is about to get under way in Europe, with the fate of Ukraine, hemmed in by 100,000 Russian troops, hanging in the balance. Senior diplomats from the United States and Russia will meet in Geneva to discuss Moscow’s demands, set out last month in two draft treaties, one with the US and one with Nato. Much of their content is unacceptable to Washington and the alliance, most importantly a pledge that Ukraine will never be a Nato member. A 14-year-old girl remains missing as parts of Queensland continue to be affected by major flooding. The aftermath of ex-tropical Cyclone Seth has caused “unexpected” heavy rains and storms across parts of the state, with further cyclone activity expected this week. Liberal state governments have voiced concern over the federal government’s religious discrimination bill. NSW and Tasmania fear the bill will override their anti-discrimination laws. Rough waters couldn’t slow long-distance swimmer Lynton Mortensen’s unprecedented attempt to swim around Lord Howe Island. But things became interesting when inquisitive Galápagos whaler sharks showed up. Authorities in Kazakhstan have said 164 people were killed in the unrest that rocked the country in the past week, including three children. The health ministry said 103 of the deaths were in Almaty, the country’s largest city and the centre of the violence. Donald Trump cannot hide behind immunity from criminal prosecution and faces the possibility of being debarred from running for public office over his role in the Capitol attack, several members of Congress said on Sunday. About 30% of former Guantánamo detainees who were resettled in third countries have not been granted legal status, according to new analysis shared exclusively with the Guardian, leaving them vulnerable to deportation and restricting their ability to rebuild their lives. At least 200 people are believed to have been killed in villages in the north-western Nigerian state of Zamfara, in some of the deadliest attacks by armed bandits at large in the region. More and more people around the world are suffering with autoimmune diseases, where their immune systems can no longer tell the difference between healthy cells and invading micro-organisms. Researchers blame western diets as a potential cause. Boris Johnson’s former Brexit minister who quit last month has warned him to commit to low taxes and the free market or risk losing the next election, as the prime minister comes under continuing pressure from the Conservative right. The ballerina’s tutu remains a traditional object of desire for many young girls: an enduring emblem of diaphanous femininity, as well as the twirling centrepiece of many a childhood music box. But is its longstanding link with the world of professional dance now out of date? Leading dancers and directors now say they find the classic costume both physically and artistically restrictive. The challenges of parenting a teenager can leave one powerless and alone. Accepting these challenges is the only way to get to the other side, writes Andie Fox. “I do not know if the world is getting more complex to raise teenagers in or if it has long been this fraught. I don’t know, because like I said, no one talks about this part of parenting with much real honesty.” Is the US really heading for a second civil war? With the country polarised and Republicans embracing authoritarianism, some experts fear a Northern Ireland-style insurgency could occur but others say armed conflict remains improbable. In this standout 2021 episode of the Full Story podcast reflecting on the 20-year anniversary of the Tampa affair, Afghan refugee Abbas Nazari, then a seven-year-old child on the MV Tampa, and Guardian journalist David Marr remember the humanitarian and political crisis that shaped Australia’s policies on asylum seekers and their claims to this day.

Cavallo, who last year became the only openly gay professional top flight men’s footballer in the world, came on as a second-half substitute during the Reds’ away game at Melbourne Victory on Saturday night and said afterwards that he had received abuse from the crowd at AAMI Park. Teenager Genevieve Beacom has made history as the first female pitcher for an Australian professional baseball team, debuting for the Melbourne Aces in the Melbourne Challenge Series on Saturday. Three men have been arrested over an alleged plot to smuggle almost $100m worth of methamphetamine into Western Australia, according to the Western Australian. Leaked letters show confusion over whether it was the federal or state government responsibility to give an exemption for Novak Djokovic from Australia’s double-vaccination rule, the Sydney Morning Herald exclusively reports.

1/10/2022,"Sources told the Guardian there was a “wine and pizza” party in the Downing Street garden and inside No 10 during the first lockdown when socialising was banned. It is understood to have taken place after a press conference, and was described as having had a celebratory feel with drinking late into the evening. After No 10 denied this, a photograph was obtained by the Guardian showing Boris Johnson, his wife and two officials at a table with wine and cheese, with another 15 officials in the rest of the garden with wine bottles visible. No 10 says Johnson had been having a work meeting and went up to his flat with his family just after 7pm that evening.  Dominic Cummings lifted the lid on a May gathering in the Downing Street garden, with invites to a “social distanced drinks”, which is believed to have been organised by the civil servant Martin Reynolds. No 10 has not denied that Johnson and his wife attended, with reports of food on tables and drinking. Restrictions on social mixing were still in place at this point. This is the date that Johnson’s chief adviser, Cummings, and communications director, Lee Cain, left their roles. Sources have reported loud music and sounds of a party coming from the flat occupied by Johnson and his wife on this date. Cummings has alleged there had been “other flat parties” and suggested the pair’s “bubble” policy should be investigated. Asked if a party went ahead in his flat on 13 November, Johnson said: “No.” While England was still in the grip of its second national lockdown, a leaving do was organised in No 10 – said to have been for Cleo Watson, a former aide to Cummings. A source told the Guardian that Johnson had personally attended and given a speech, remarking on how full with people the room was, before leaving to continue working. When London was in tier 2, which only allowed socialising in groups of six outside, the then education secretary, Gavin Williamson, threw a party in his Whitehall department. The most senior civil servant in the department, Susan Acland-Hood, attended and admitted that there had been a “work-related” gathering hosted in the canteen. She did not dispute people had been drinking wine, and appeared to blame Williamson for instigating the event. She recalled he had wanted to “say a few words” to thank staff after a difficult year. A quiz was held for members of the private office of Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, who was originally meant to be investigating the reports of parties in No 10. Invitations were sent out titled “Christmas Party!” and about 15 people were thought to be in attendance over Zoom. Responding to the claims, a government spokesperson said it was a virtual quiz with a small number of people from the office taking part from their desks. “The cabinet secretary played no part in the event, but walked through the team’s office on the way to his own office. No outside guests or other staff were invited or present. This lasted for an hour and drinks and snacks were bought by those attending. He also spoke briefly to staff in the office before leaving.” A party was held in No 10 when London was in tier 3 restrictions, which banned social events, according to multiple sources after the Daily Mirror first broke the story. Several dozen people – a mix of civil servants and political staff – reportedly attended and were told to bring “secret Santa” presents, with cheese and wine laid on. While Johnson’s spokesperson insisted no rules had been broken and then denied any party took place, a video filmed four days after the event was published by ITV. The leaked footage showed Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s then aide, rehearsing for televised press conferences and laughing and joking with aides about a party on 18 December. Stratton all but confirmed the event had taken place by laughing it off as a “business meeting” but added: “It was not socially distanced.” A Christmas quiz was also organised for No 10 staff, with invitations emailed to everyone who worked in the building. Some guests were said to have dialled in by Zoom but others apparently attended in person and sat in groups of six, some wearing Christmas jumpers. A photograph later emerged in the Mirror of the prime minister taking part. The prime minister’s “bubble” has come under scrutiny before, after his spokesperson did not deny that Nimco Ali, a close friend of Carrie Johnson, stayed with them over Christmas. One of the explanations offered was that Ali was considered part of the Johnsons’ childcare bubble. However, under the rules, the arrangement was meant to be purely for a second household to look after children, with the adults not meant to be socialising.",News/Politics,No 10 partying in lockdown: who enjoyed what and when,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/no-10-partying-in-lockdown-who-enjoyed-what-and-when
1/10/2022,"It was two and a half years later than planned, but few in Yaoundé would be bothered by that. The hosts Cameroon suffered an early setback, but thanks to two penalties from their captain, Vincent Aboubakar, they preserved an unbeaten home record in competitive games that stretches back to 1973 and began their Cup of Nations campaign with a win. It wasn’t just the result that should encourage Cameroon’s Portuguese coach, Toni Conceição. Aboubakar, who volleyed the winner in the final five years ago when Cameroon won their fifth title, looked lively throughout. André-Frank Zamba Anguissa controlled the tempo from the back of midfield. And, perhaps most importantly, other than the misjudgement that cost the goal, André Onana impressed in goal in only his fifth game since returning after a drugs ban (in which he seems to have been deeply unfortunate, mistaking a diuretic that had been prescribed to his wife for paracetamol), making a superb reflex block early in the second half.  If there was relief about Cameroon’s comeback, there was relief also that the game was taking place at all, and that it was able to do so in front of relatively well-populated stands. A repeated issue in recent Cups of Nations has been almost empty stadiums for games not involving the hosts. There are numerous reasons for that, from high ticket prices to inaccessible stadiums, but the most significant tends to be the lack of a match-going culture. Football, for many, is a sport consumed on television and experience suggests that fans who are used to watching the Premier League or the Champions League at home or in a local bar tend not to change their habits just because Ethiopia are playing Cape Verde a couple of miles down the road. But Cameroon does have a match-going culture, and crowds there were excellent both for the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations in 2016 and the African Nations Championship, the tournament for domestically based players, in 2020. Covid restrictions mean that capacity is restricted to 80% capacity for games featuring Cameroon and 60% for all other matches, but the atmosphere for Sunday’s opener was vibrant. There is a clear sense of pride that Cameroon is at last hosting the Cup of Nations again. It is 50 years since Cameroon last staged the tournament, when Congo, having beaten the hosts in the semi-final, overcame Mali in the final. This is a very different competition: then it comprised just eight teams and only six players were at European clubs (five in France plus Zaire’s Julien Kialunda at Anderlecht). Now there are 24 finalists and 404 players based at European clubs plus others in the US, China, South Korea, India, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Africa has become a great exporter of talent, which brings both benefits, in that many are playing at the highest level and even those who aren’t are experiencing a range of styles and environments, and challenges, not least in trying to schedule the tournament. And for all the grumbling from European clubs about their players heading to Cameroon, it is worth bearing in mind that the vast majority do come, which hasn’t always been the case. The expanded group stage may feel bloated with six groups of four filtering to a last 16, but, as with the Euros, that is more a question of format than of quality. There may be frustration that still no African side has got beyond the quarter-finals of the World Cup (in 1972, only two African nations had competed at a World Cup, and it would be 1978 before one won a game), but while development may have stalled at the top end, where there has been progress is in the middle class. That includes Burkina Faso, runners-up in the 2013 Cup of Nations. They were a little unfortunate to miss out on March’s qualifying play-offs for the World Cup, finishing their group unbeaten but two points behind Algeria, the reigning African champions, but this is a bright young squad that has every chance of reaching the 2026 World Cup, the expansion of which means there will be nine African qualifiers. Here, despite fanciful talk of Kamou Malo’s bold 2-4-3-1 system (ie, 4-2-3-1 with spasmodically attacking full-backs), Burkina Faso largely sat deep, looked to absorb pressure and strike on the break. They had probably been the more dangerous side when Gustavo Sangaré capitalised on an Onana misjudgement to put them ahead with an airborne volley. But two wild challenges in the box, the first by Aston Villa’s Bertrand Traoré, the second by Issoufou Dayo, gifted Cameroon a pair of penalties before half-time, both of which were converted by Aboubakar. That eased home nerves and Cameroon can already begin looking forward to the last 16. Burkina Faso, meanwhile, showed enough to suggest that they should also progress to the knockout stages.",Sport/Football,Relief and atmosphere as Cameroon open Africa Cup of Nations in style,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/09/relief-and-atmosphere-as-cameroon-open-africa-cup-of-nations-in-style
