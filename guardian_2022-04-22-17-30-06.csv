4/22/2022,"The English countryside is a “place of business” and already has “hundreds of thousands of miles of public footpaths”, a minister has said in response to questions about why the ”right to roam” report has been shelved. The comments by Mark Spencer, the leader of the house, came as campaign groups expressed their fury over the Treasury’s decision to shelve the review, which was commissioned to search out a “quantum shift in how our society supports people to access and engage with the outdoors”. The review, headed by Lord Agnew, had included a potential expansion of the much-fought-over “right to roam”, which campaigners fear will not now go ahead. In response, activists are planning mass trespasses to raise awareness of how much of England’s land is out of bounds. The right to roam exists over only 8% of the country. Spencer made the remarks after the Green MP Caroline Lucas asked why the responses to the Agnew report into making more of the countryside publicly accessible would not be published. He said: “I think we are blessed in this country with hundreds of thousands of miles of public footpath to allow people to access the countryside. We have to recognise the countryside is not just a place of leisure, but it is also a place of business and food production.” Lucas responded: “Utterly feeble ‘defence’ from leader of house on government quashing review into the right to roam. Working and leisure are not incompatible – is this really the government’s excuse?” Ninety-two per cent of England’s land is privately owned and not available to access. The Countryside and Rights of Way (CRoW) Act 2000 gives a legal right of public access to mountains, moorland, heaths, some downland and commons, and the English coastal path. Campaigners have asked for this to be extended to cover rivers, woods and green belt land. Ninety-seven per cent of rivers are off limits to the public, and tens of thousands of acres of woodland have benefited from public subsidy yet remain publicly inaccessible. This weekend, the Right to Roam campaign is celebrating the 90th anniversary of the 1932 Kinder Trespass, when hundreds of activists trespassed on Kinder Scout in the Peak District. They were there to highlight the fact that walkers in England and Wales were denied access to areas of open country. A group of ramblers will be walking to Kinder Scout on Sunday for a Kinder in Colour event, which will be led by people of colour. The organisers said: “Even with a small amount of rights of way available to ramblers, the countryside is still rife with barriers to access, especially for black people and people of colour. With this in mind, we want to celebrate the Kinder Scout legacy by creating a new culture for the countryside, one which is fully inclusive and embraces differences.” The Right to Roam campaign is planning a series of mass trespasses planned between May and September, including in Totnes on 8 May and West Berkshire on 14 May, with more to follow. James MacColl, the head of policy, advocacy and campaigns for the Ramblers, said the UK government was not doing anywhere near enough to improve access to the countryside. He explained: “The government … isn’t making use of its own Environment Act powers to set public access targets. Its new farm payments scheme shows no sign of rewarding farmers for improving access on their land, despite repeated promises. Proposed changes to the planning system don’t prioritise access to nature. “As the Ramblers continue to campaign for access rights, this weekend we’ll be celebrating the 90th anniversary the Kinder Scout trespass, a landmark protest on the route to improving access to the countryside for all. “Access to these green open spaces is still currently very limited and unequal and the Ramblers wants to see government extend the freedom to roam across England and Wales so that it is more easily accessible, and better connected to our path network and our towns and cities.”",News/Environment,UK minister defends shelving of ‘right to roam’ report ahead of Kinder Scout trespass,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/22/uk-minister-defends-shelving-of-right-to-roam-report-ahead-of-kinder-scout-trespass
4/22/2022,"The drum is central to powwow music. Singers beat in unison on its skin as their voices overlap with vibrato-laden syllabic sounds. No specific language is sung; instead powwow music is a spiritual communication that has anchored Indigenous American inter-tribal gatherings for over a century. On his debut album, Niineta, powwow singer Joe Rainey does without the drum circle and instead foregrounds layers of his own voice, assisted by producer Andrew Broder: the pair met at Bon Iver’s Eaux Claires music festival and subsequently became a part of his 37d03d collective. The resulting 10 tracks provide a glimpse into the powwow lineage while pushing it into new settings and spaces. Many tracks add strings and grandeur to Rainey’s yearning, multi-octave range, transporting his performance to the realm of the concert hall. On BE Son, synth strings pad beneath his baritone to create a forlorn sense of longing, while Turned Engine sees long, bowing phrases add a romantic underpinning to Rainey’s tenor duet with singer Allie Bearhead. The intimate ballad Ch 1222 pairs sparse piano chords with Rainey’s whispering register. Other songs dwell in the club. Towards the end of Turned Engine, Broder brings in a distorted kick drum that explodes like the heartbeat of an industrial techno track – a feature that continues on the crunching Easy on the Cide – bringing to mind the sparse soundscapes of techno producer Perc. The punchy 808 bass of No Chants takes us into trap territory, allowing space for Rainey’s voice to soar atop its minimal rhythm and exposing the underlying kineticism of his powwow songs. Rainey emphasises that this modern subversion doesn’t negate the ancestry of his music. “These are all my creations, but they’re powwow songs, and our language is sacred,” he says in the press materials. It is a brave endeavour that straddles the line between tradition and adaptation, and ultimately Rainey and Broder succeed – allowing the uninitiated to experience and enjoy the enduring emotions of powwow music without muting its ineffable power. Durban gqom trio Phelimuncasi release their second album, Ama Gogela (Nyege Nyege Tapes), a thundering success producing punchy syncopated rhythms paired with the group’s communal spoken word. Japanese singer-songwriter Yama Warashi’s Crispy Moon (Prah Recordings) is a meandering collection that traverses everything from Alice Coltrane-esque ambient soundscapes to Afrobeat rhythms and synth-funk. Highlights come on the quieter moments of Makkuroi Mizu and Haha No Uta. Moroccan Sufi collective The Master Musicians of Jajouka present their debut, Dancing Under the Moon (Glitterbeat Records). It’s a record best listened to in one sitting, showcasing the trance-inducing melodies produced by the double-reed rhaita.",Arts/Music,Joe Rainey: Niineta review | Ammar Kalia's global album of the month,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/joe-rainey-niineta-review-pushing-powwow-music-into-new-spaces
4/22/2022,"Three exceptional young actors carry Nick Rowland’s brooding tale of restricted horizons and brutal circumstance in rural Ireland. Cosmo Jarvis is a hulking presence as Arm, an ex-boxer now subsisting as the muscle for his friend/boss Dympna (Barry Keoghan), a junior member of a violent criminal family. Arm has an autistic son with Niamh Algar’s Ursula, but she hates what he has become and is keen to escape her insular, backwater life. Jarvis gives a superbly measured performance, seemingly punch-drunk and pliable but with a maelstrom of emotion swirling just below the surface. A stark drama whose tragedy is made all the sadder by its glimmers of hope.Wednesday 27 April, 9pm, Film4 Continuing the channel’s season of RKO pictures, HC Potter’s 1948 comedy gives us Cary Grant in his prime. His trademark impotent indignation is in full force as a New York ad executive, living with his family in a cramped flat, whose new fixer-upper in rural Connecticut turns into a big ol’ money pit. Physical comedy and marital strife (with Myrna Loy’s patient wife) ensue, with Melvyn Douglas getting all the best lines as their wittily exasperated best friend and reluctant lawyer.Thursday 28 April, 9pm, BBC Four Michael Smiley’s softly spoken toll-booth operator doesn’t seem that interesting. But when a figure from his dark past bumps into him accidentally, his hush-hush criminal operation in a remote corner of Pembrokeshire is brought to the attention of the area’s one honest copper (Annes Elwy). Ryan Andrew Hooper’s comic twist on the spaghetti western offers an array of Ealing-esque eccentrics (female Elvis impersonator; triplet robbers; paramedic/dogging devotee) but it’s the more underplayed scenes between Smiley and Elwy that give the enterprise its necessary depth.Friday 29 April, Amazon Prime Video “So she looks a bit off balance /She possesses golden talents.” Bob Merrill’s lyrics are as much a description of the film’s lead, Barbra Streisand, as its subject, Fanny Brice – the Jewish New York performer who became a star with the Zeigfeld Follies in the early 20th century. In William Wyler’s sumptuous 1968 musical, Streisand (in her Oscar-winning film debut) owns the screen, committed to Brice’s comic pratfalls but capable of belting out the big, heartfelt numbers. Omar Sharif makes for an interesting contrast as her beau, suave gambler Nick.Saturday 23 April, 2.05pm, BBC Two With the sad news of Bruce Willis’s retirement, here’s a tribute in the form of Rian Johnson’s cunning 2012 sci-fi thriller, which offers two Bruces for the price of one … sort of. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, an assassin in 2044 who kills people sent back in time by his mob bosses from 2074 – when time travel has been invented. If his sardonic smirk and smudged nose look familiar, that’s because he is the youthful version of Willis’s character, not yet burdened by real love and loss. But when old Joe materialises as his next hit, young Joe faces a mortal dilemma.Saturday 23 April, 9pm, Great! Movies One of Clint Eastwood’s favourite films, William A Wellman’s tightly plotted 1942 western has a moral complexity that would fit well beside its star Henry Fonda’s later 12 Angry Men. Fonda plays a cowboy who is swept up in a town’s inchoate rage following rumours of rustling and murder. A mob mentality quickly takes hold and a lynching party is formed, but when the supposed criminals are tracked down, doubts form as to exactly whose justice is being served. A sobering story about what happens when emotion trumps reason.Wednesday 27 April, 3.15pm, Talking Pictures TV Martin Scorsese’s 1991 film is a brash, steroid-pumped remake of J Lee Thompson’s Hitchcock-inspired thriller. A noble Gregory Peck from the original is swapped for a flawed Nick Nolte as lawyer Sam Bowden, whose intentionally bad defence of psychopathic rapist Max Cady comes back to haunt him when the criminal is released and seeks bloody vengeance. Robert De Niro takes the Robert Mitchum role and adds muscle and sweaty menace to the violence, while the blurring of the boundaries between the men gives a modern touch to the genre stylings.Friday 29 April, 10.40pm, BBC One",Arts/Television & radio,From Calm With Horses to Cape Fear: the seven best films to watch on TV this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/from-calm-with-horses-to-cape-fear-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week
4/22/2022,"Chart-topping British pop singer Tom Grennan has been hospitalised after a physical assault in New York City. His manager John Dawkins wrote on social media: In the early hours of [Thursday] morning after Tom’s New York show, he was the victim of an unprovoked attack and robbery outside a bar in Manhattan. Tom is currently being assessed by doctors for his injuries which include a ruptured ear, torn eardrum and issue with his previously fractured jaw. Despite this Tom is in good spirits but needs to temporarily recuperate while doctors assess his ability to continue with his touring. Grennan has postponed a concert due to take place in Washington DC this weekend. Dawkins thanked Grennan’s fans for their support. The Bedford-born singer, 26, previously suffered a physical assault aged 18 by a group of strangers, that left him needing a metal plate and screws in his jaw for life. Grennan broke through in 2017 with his single Found What I’ve Been Looking For, a slow-burning hit that ended up being certified gold in the UK. His second album Evering Road, released in 2021, reached No 1 and featured two Top 10 singles, Let’s Go Home Together and Little Bit of Love. The latter track was nominated for song of the year at this year’s Brit awards, and he was also nominated in the rock/alternative category. Last month he released a new single, Remind Me.",Arts/Music,Pop singer Tom Grennan hospitalised after assault in New York,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/pop-singer-tom-grennan-hospitalised-after-assault-in-new-york
4/22/2022,"The “emo ambient” tag seems to have stuck for the music of emergent San Antonio artist Claire Rousay, and in all fairness, it fits pretty well. Her work, at its core, is an experiment in using commonplace environmental sounds to tug at the heartstrings directly. Across her quickly growing discography, field recordings of lighters, typewriters and other domestic paraphernalia seamlessly mingle with voice recordings, text-to-speech and the hesitant harmonics of classical instrumentation and drone. Under her direction, these components seem to coalesce into something more than a mere meeting of acoustics and textures, evoking emotion, memory and a striking sense of vulnerability in the listening experience. This is music for Oliveros-inspired deep listeners and for poets finding meaning among the mundane. On her latest record, Everything Perfect Is Already Here, Rousay welcomes melodic elements into her compositions: on It Feels Foolish to Care, wandering harp progressions join slumbering violins, voices and laughter, and possibly paper rustles and poured liquids; a piano refrain drops in towards the end without buildup, tender yet sudden enough to hit like a stunner out of nowhere. Rousay’s percussionist tendencies surface on the title track, though her “kit” now consists of microphone scratchings and the brief movements and exchanges of humans. Transitionary wind sounds and leaf-crunching footsteps walk the track over to its eventual harp outro, though it’s hard to be sure whether we’re coming or going. Between Rousay’s drones and disruptions, melodics and arguments, the album becomes a place for feeling in the present, untethered by time, as familiar as a memory and as placeless as a dream.",Arts/Music,Claire Rousay: Everything Perfect Is Already Here review – everyday sounds that tug at the heartstrings,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/claire-rousay-everything-perfect-is-already-here-review-everyday-sounds-that-tug-at-the-heartstrings
