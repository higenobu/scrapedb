3/25/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories right now. Joe Biden will travel to a Polish town near the border with Ukraine today in a show of solidarity with the war-torn country and in an attempt to display western resolve against a Russian invasion that continues to target cities and civilians. After a busy day of summitry in Brussels yesterday, the US president will visit Rzeszów ahead of talks with Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda. More than two million Ukrainians have fled to Poland, which has taken the brunt of the refugee crisis, and Biden will discuss a coordinated humanitarian response to aid Warsaw’s efforts. He will also meet American troops who have been deployed in recent weeks to bolster Nato’s eastern flank. Biden claimed yesterday that Nato had “never been more united” and he warned Vladimir Putin the west would respond if the Russian president used chemical weapons in Ukraine. Boris Johnson also warned that such a move would result in “catastrophic” consequences for Russia. However, EU leaders remain divided however over whether to cut off gas and oil supplies from Russia, and the effectiveness of sanctions was also called into question last night by Ukraine’s president, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, who said the measures had been “a little late” to deter Putin. Some Ukrainian refugees have described being forced to return to Ukraine because of protracted delays in securing UK visas, while others are living in underground bomb shelters in Kyiv, dismayed by the long wait for visas to be processed. Going the other way are foreign legion fighters, with US volunteers now turning up in Ukraine. And in Russia, defence minister Sergei Shoigu appeared on TV yesterday in an apparent attempt to quell rumours that he has been scapegoated for the faltering invasion. But you had to be quick to catch him. He disappeared again very quickly, fuelling the suspicions that he has been removed from office. Here’s what we know so far on day 30 of the invasion, and you can also follow developments at the live blog here. Poor show – Up to 1.3 million people will fall into absolute poverty next year, economists have warned, as Rishi Sunak tried to counter accusations that he hasn’t done enough to ease the worst drop in living standards for six decades. The Resolution Foundation said the number of people in absolute poverty will rise to 12.5 million, or one-fifth of the population. Asked why he had not given more support for those on universal credit, who will see their benefits rise by just 3% while inflation leaps to nearly 8%, Sunak retorted: “We can’t do everything.” Our economics editor says the upshot is that Britain is no longer a country where workers can expect to get better off year after year. Academy earners – The government has failed to control excessive salaries earned by academy trust leaders, according to MPs who also criticised the use of millions in public money to “prop up” poorly managed trusts. According to a report by the public accounts committee published today, the number of academy trusts paying at least one senior staff member more than £100,000 went up from 1,875 in 2019-20 to 2,245 the following year. Bridge block – An increasing number of Britain’s road bridges are crumbling. More than 3,200 have been identified as being substandard, with a £1.2bn repair cost, local authorities say. More than 100 council-maintained bridges have been declared unfit for the heaviest vehicles in the past year, with 17 bridges collapsing entirely and 37 partially in that time. Devon has the greatest number of bridges in disrepair – 229 – while Dorset has had the most collapses, at 12. Electric charge – The number of electric car chargers could grow tenfold to 300,000 by 2030 after criticism that the rollout of public infrastructure is too slow to match rapid growth in sales. The Department for Transport said it would invest an extra £450m to install more chargers ahead of a ban on sales of new cars and vans with petrol and diesel engines from 2030. There were 420,000 pure-electric cars on UK roads at the end of February but only 29,600 public charge points. ‘Stand firm, Mark!!!’ – The US conservative activist Ginni Thomas – who is married to supreme court justice Clarence Thomas – implored Donald Trump’s chief of staff to help overturn the 2020 election results, according to reports. In one of 29 messages, Thomas wrote to Mark Meadows on 10 November: “Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!… who is standing for America’s constitutional governance…” Meanwhile, Trump has sued Hillary Clinton over an alleged conspiracy to rig the 2016 election.

Saqib Mahmood was spurred on by the sight of his England teammates in their whites getting ready to take the field as he and Jack Leach mounted their determined 10th-wicket rearguard on the opening day of the third Test against West Indies in Grenada. Emma Raducanu’s tough education in her maiden WTA Tour season has continued as she served for the match in her Miami Open debut but still lost to Katerina Siniakova in the second round. The Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has insisted Eddie Jones is not “bulletproof” and belatedly admitted England’s Six Nations performance was not acceptable. The human rights group Reprieve has demanded Formula One ends its association with Saudi Arabian sportswashing after the family of a teenager sentenced to death wrote to Lewis Hamilton pleading with him to speak out on their son’s behalf before this weekend’s race. And the process of deciding upon a new owner for Chelsea took a step forward after a Saudi Arabian consortium was removed from the running. Sir Christopher Hohn, the billionaire boss of the hedge fund TCI, has reiterated his support for action on climate change by urging shareholders to vote against bank directors involved in “greenwashing” who lobby against climate action. “Any bank making a net zero promise while actively lobbying against necessary climate regulation … is greenwashing,” he said in a statement. The Guardian leads with “Biden’s warning to Putin over chemical weapons”, and the same goes for the Times – “Nato will act if chemical weapons used, says Biden” – and the Telegraph – “Biden: We will respond in kind if Putin uses chemicals”. The Mail reflects Downing Street’s delight at the Kremlin’s condemnation of Boris Johnson: “Kremlin: Boris Is Our No 1 Enemy”. The P&O scandal is the lead in several papers with the FT’s splash saying “P&O chief confesses sackings were illegal but says he would do it again”, while the Mirror has “Shame on you” and the Record goes for “P&O pirates”. The i reports “Sunak and Johnson at odds over UK’s cost of living crisis” and the Express keeps up the pressure on the government over the cost of living issue with a lead saying “Why Britain must act to end this despair”. The Sun’s lead is about the royal visit to Jamaica: “One’s love”, it says. The Guardian morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

Jack Seale Spencer (Pablo Larraín, 2021), Amazon Prime VideoPablo Larraín revisits similar terrain to his 2016 film about Jackie Kennedy with this intimate drama focusing on Diana, Princess of Wales, another iconic figure beset by tragedy. Gamely and unnervingly impersonated by Kristen Stewart, Diana is a woman on the verge. Duty-bound to attend a royal family Christmas at Sandringham in 1991, she rebels against her sterile marriage and suffocating public role. Despair soon leads to physical and mental disintegration. In a way, Diana was badly cast as a princess and Larraín makes us empathise with her stage fright – she can’t remember her lines, the costumes don’t fit and her audience is brutally unforgiving.

3/25/2022,"Scott Morrison has said Australia was not blindsided by a draft security deal between China and Solomon Islands, which experts warn has demonstrated a “black and white” intent at expanding influence in the Pacific. The draft would allow China to base navy warships in the Pacific less than 2,000km off the Australian coast, but some experts, including the Lowy Institute’s Jonathan Pryke, caution it reads more like a “wishlist” from China than a finalised agreement. Solomon Islands officials are yet to comment on the status of the document, which would still need to go through the Pacific nation’s cabinet. In November, Australia sent more than 100 police and defence force personnel to Solomon Islands to help quell unrest, but found itself in competition with China which also agreed to send police. Solomon Islands switched diplomatic ties from Taiwan to Beijing in 2019, which partly fuelled discontent that led to riots in the capital, Honiara. On Friday, Morrison told reporters in Sydney that Australia is a “leader” in the region, and having upped its aid contribution from $1.12bn to $1.7bn is “the single largest provider of development assistance into the Pacific”. The Australian prime minister said that China’s push for a security deal with Solomon Islands highlights “the constant pressure and … push that is coming into the region from interests that are not aligned with Australia’s and not aligned with those of the Pacific”. Morrison noted Australia had negotiated a bilateral security deal with Solomon Islands in 2017, and is always the “first call” when a crisis arises. “Now, there are others who may seek to pretend to influence and to seek to get some sort of foothold in the region,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “So, I think these most recent developments and the uncertainty and instability in the Solomons just highlights once again why it has been so important that we leaned in as heavily as we have.” Morrison said Australia would “see how [the draft agreement] progresses”. Asked about the prospect of a Chinese naval base so close to Australia, Morrison replied that Australia wanted “a free and open Indo-Pacific”. “We share with our Pacific family values, we share culture, the principles of democracy and freedom, and these are things that are very important to the Pacific Island peoples.” Pryke, the director of the Lowy Institute’s Pacific Islands program, told Guardian Australia that caution should be applied to the draft deal that “reads to me as a Chinese-drafted wishlist” and not “earnestly negotiated” yet by Solomon Islands. “The Australian government has a much more hardened view of China’s intent; this sort of document would not come as a surprise,” he said. Pryke suggested after years of China saying it is a “benign actor” despite increased geopolitical contestation, the draft deal is proof of China’s intent in “black and white”. “In a sense it has done a favour to the Australian government and a disservice to China, because it removes strategic ambiguity and reveals that intent.” But Pryke said Australia should be “alert but not alarmed” because a buildup to a port in Solomon Islands would take several decades. “There’s all sorts of engagement that China could do to build its way up to a military presence,” he said. “Get this agreement, start with police, maybe the next step would be to set up some dual-use coast guard facility, then put up a fuel depot.” “Because it’s happening piecemeal, it’s happening without too much alarm. “If … at every turn the alarm is raised and it gets international attention and forces Solomon Islands to react, it reduces the likelihood of them moving on to the next step.” Earlier, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said if reports of the deal are correct “then this would have real implications for the region, and is of concern”. “Australia needs to be a partner of choice in the Pacific,” he told reporters in Shellharbour. “We were that for a long period of time. “When this government came to office and withdrew funding, in terms of its aid and its presence in the Pacific, that was an error of judgment,” he said. “We have had the Pacific step-up in terms of rhetoric. That’s a good thing. We need to make sure that we engage with the region.”",News/World news,"Chinese draft security deal with Solomon Islands didn’t blindside Australia, Morrison says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/chinese-draft-security-deal-with-solomon-islands-didnt-blindside-australia-morrison-says
3/25/2022,"Free-range chickens and eggs may no longer be feasible to produce in the UK and elsewhere in Europe in future due to a dramatic escalation in avian flu outbreaks, say leading disease experts.The UK and continental Europe have been hit by the largest outbreak of avian flu on record this winter, with millions of birds culled on farms across the continent. Experts say highly pathogenic variants of avian flu now appear to be endemic in wild birds, creating a risk of infection all year.In the UK, farmers have been ordered to keep their birds indoors since last November and as of this week have been prevented from selling their eggs as free range.  BarnEggs from birds in indoor housing of one or more levels that are free to move around. There is a maximum stocking density of nine hens per square metre of useable area.  CageEggs from birds housed indoors in cages, with each one holding between 40 and 80 hens and including a nest box and perches. OrganicBirds that lay these eggs have daytime access to an outdoor area. Indoors there is a maximum stocking density of six hens per square metre of useable area. They are also held in smaller flocks and fed an organically produced diet. Free-rangeEggs from birds with daytime access to an outdoor area. The indoor housing has a maximum stocking density of nine hens per square metre of useable area. egginfo.co.uk The latest reported outbreak, at a farm in Suffolk last weekend, led to more than 80,000 ducks being culled after confirmation of a highly pathogenic variant of avian flu.“There is a serious problem for free-range and outdoor farms,” said Dr Guillaume Fournié, a veterinarian and epidemiologist at the Royal Veterinary College. “We are seeing outbreaks on large [indoor] poultry farms that would have had high biosecurity. This suggests that with high environmental exposure to the virus, now it’s hard to ensure a farm is 100% biosecure.” Marion Koopmans, a virologist and adviser to the World Health Organization (WHO), said the situation was “horrible” for the free-range poultry industry. “The ecology [of avian flu] has changed drastically in just a few years. We now have local circulation all year round in Europe, it’s not just a seasonal threat. It has a permanent presence in the wild bird population.”Highly pathogenic avian flu is already endemic in a number of countries in Asia, with infection of poultry reported all-year round.“The question [in the UK/Europe] is whether sedentary (non-migratory) wild birds will maintain the virus circulation over the summer. This would mean a constant pressure of infection on poultry farms, which would then increase seasonally with migratory birds,” said Fournié.Koopmans, who took part in the WHO’s Covid mission to China in 2021, said higher levels of biosecurity, vaccination of chickens and reductions in intensive poultry farms in parts of Europe may all be needed to prevent outbreaks.Measures to ensure biosecurity and prevent infection reaching hens include cleaning and disinfecting, safe storage of feed and water and quarantining new stock. France, which has experienced close to 1,000 avian flu outbreaks this winter, has been trialling avian influenza vaccines, but the solution has been complicated by the numerous variants of avian flu.The market for free-range eggs has grown rapidly in the UK over the past decade. Last year, almost two-thirds of 11 billion eggs produced in the UK last year were free-range – up from 27% in 2004. The Co-op, Sainsburys, M&S, Morrisons and Waitrose no longer stock eggs that are not free-range. Some have suggested introducing covered outdoor areas or changing the rules for free-range egg producers to allow for longer periods spent outdoors. However, it is unclear how consumers would react to this shift. “The whole point of free-range is they have the opportunity to roam outside,” said Andrew Knight, a veterinary professor at the University of Winchester.Radically changing the rules for free-range eggs would be wrong, said Dan Crossley, from the Food Ethics Council. “I think most people have a reasonable understanding of what free-range is, so what we want to avoid is muddying the water and any confusion around what different terms mean.” UK government officials have said there are no plans to review the existing legislation, which provided producers with a 16-week “derogation” during which the free-range description can be kept on eggs even though the hens have been confined.Mark Williams, chief executive of the British Egg Industry Council, said he was confident that hens would be allowed outside again soon.“The greatest risk comes when the migratory birds are carrying it around, which is why we have these outbreaks at the same time every year between Autumn and Spring,” he said.The UK Health Security Agency said there was year-round avian flu surveillance of dead wild birds. “Despite recording a record number of outbreaks this season, the risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low,” said a spokesperson.Transmission from an infected bird to a human is very rare, according to health officials, with fewer than five cases recorded in the UK – most recently in January, when a man caught it from ducks he kept inside his home.

3/25/2022,"For sheer drama, we will probably never match the spectacle of Judge Brett Kavanaugh snivelling through his supreme court confirmation hearings in 2018. But this week’s hearing by the Senate judiciary committee to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden’s pick for the supreme court, came a close second. There was Republican senator Josh Hawley asking Jackson if she was soft on child molesters. There was Lindsey Graham, going on a rant that, if not quite expletive-filled, took on a playground quality with language like “crap”, “ass” and “how would you feel if we did that to you?” And there was Ted Cruz, straight-facedly asking Jackson if she thinks babies are racist. Along with someone throwing a pie at Rupert Murdoch and Zoom meetings of the Handforth parish council, it was up there with the best histrionics of the committee room canon. Jackson herself was almost supernaturally composed, occasionally letting a pause extend a beat beyond normal to indicate the scale of the resources required to stay calm. The confirmation hearings at the supreme court have become a grandstanding opportunity for ambitious senators, rather than a useful extra-legal enquiry, and of course they are completely partisan. But while, four years ago, no one but the staunchest Republican could hear Kavanaugh’s inarticulate address and conclude he occupied his seat on merit alone, the visceral dislike many of us on the left felt towards, say, Amy Coney Barrett, seemed to me not entirely premised on her performance and track record. What I mean by that, is that while Coney Barrett’s thoughts on abortion and connection to groups such as People of Praise were legitimately concerning, there was, on my part at least, also a visceral dislike of the woman that took much more personal form. Ugh, I recall thinking, while watching her confirmation hearing; look at her fanatically straight hair and beady little eyes. She’s clearly a Catholic fundamentalist. And what’s up with her adoption of all those children? In spite of the mixed racial makeup of her family, I bet at heart she’s a massive racist. So my internal judgments jogged along, and very enjoyable they were, too, premised as they were on moral superiority. In similar form, one can imagine without too much effort, what visceral responses Jackson’s broad outline might trigger in spectators on the right. I don’t mean to erase the two women’s legitimate differences. Late last year, Barrett, in the course of hearing an abortion case, made the bizarre and, to my mind, woefully wrong-headed assertion that adoption rendered many abortions unnecessary. But it was still a useful thought experiment to consider that nominees put forward to the supreme court by Republican presidents were as subject to extra-judicial dislike as those coming in from the left. Unlike Kavanaugh, Barrett is clearly highly intelligent and extremely well qualified. With super-human effort, I can stop the domino-run of character assassination that takes off once I understand that I don’t like her politics, and consider the possibility that she’s not a bad judge. Where this experiment falls down is in trying to extend the same largesse to the Republican senators themselves. However hard I try, I can’t put most Republican senators in the same category as Dianne Feinstein. I can concentrate on keeping my responses relevant until my veins stand out, but a single image of Hawley will trigger a flood of judgment that always terminates in, oh, gross, what a terrible little runt that man is: he’s literally got a pin head. This is not a helpful or sophisticated response, but oh God, here comes Ted Cruz: the state of that man. This kind of reflex attack is recreational and tribal, used on both sides to foment connections with others who feel the same way. Increasingly, I wonder if the extreme sport of giving a minute to the possibility that, in some of our responses, we’re as trigger-happy as the other lot, is a beneficial undertaking worth putting time in to. Aren’t we as childish as them, sometimes? And as reluctant to take into account the whole story? I can do this, I think. I can consider people I violently disagree with fully rounded human beings worthy of consideration and respect. And then I’m caught off guard by a clip of Graham, scurrying out of the committee room like a tiny, angry blond mole. The state of that man. And there it is; all my mature aims, once again, lost.

3/25/2022,"Billionaire Sir Christopher Hohn has urged shareholders to vote against bank directors involved in “greenwashing”, and who lobby against climate action. The hedge fund manager, who once had Britain’s highest salary at £1m a day, made headlines when he donated £50,000 to climate activist group Extinction Rebellion. Hohn, who was once Rishi Sunak’s boss at hedge fund TCI, is also one of the nation’s biggest philanthropists, and has pumped billions into his own charity, The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation. He said: “Any bank making a net zero promise while actively lobbying against necessary climate regulation – such as mandatory disclosure of borrowers’ emissions and climate action plans – is greenwashing. Shareholders should vote against the directors of banks who are hiding their exposure to climate risk.” Hohn’s statement comes as InfluenceMap, a climate thinktank, found that the world’s 30 largest listed financial institutions are undermining their net zero targets by continuing to fund fossil fuel expansion and lobbying against attempts to align financial regulation with climate goals. Their report shows the finance sector is reluctant to introduce meaningful fossil fuel exclusion policies and has enabled at least $740bn (£561bn) of financing for the fossil fuel production sector during the past two years. According to the analysis, JP Morgan was the biggest enabler of fossil fuel financing with $81bn in 2020-21, followed by Citigroup with $69bn and Bank of America with $55bn. Despite setting a 2030 target to reduce power sector emissions, JP Morgan increased its financing of coal production from $1.28bn in 2020 to $3.08bn in 2021. Only seven financial institutions have set thermal coal exit plans in line with the International Panel on Climate Change’s guidelines on keeping heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and only four (Barclays, BNP Paribas, ING and Société Générale) have committed to reducing their oil and gas exposure by 2025. However, some of these policies contain loopholes allowing for continued fossil fuel financing under certain circumstances. This is not the first time Hohn has taken a stand on climate change. When he was revealed as XR’s single biggest donor, he said: “Humanity is aggressively destroying the world with climate change and there is an urgent need for us all to wake up to this fact.”",News/Business,Sir Chris Hohn urges shareholders to vote against ‘greenwashing’ bank directors,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/25/sir-chris-hohn-urges-shareholders-to-vote-against-greenwashing-bank-directors
3/25/2022,"An increasing number of Britain’s road bridges are crumbling, with more than 3,200 identified as being substandard with a £1.2bn repair cost, local authorities say. In the past year, more than 100 council-maintained bridges have been declared unfit for the heaviest vehicles, according to research by the RAC Foundation, with 17 bridges collapsing entirely and 37 partially in that time. The analysis, based on responses from councils across England, Scotland and Wales, found 3,211 substandard bridges – but only a few hundred were likely to be repaired in the next five years owing to a shortage of funds, authorities said. The numbers included everything from road bridges spanning small streams, as little as 1.5m wide, to the high-profile closure of the once-busy Hammersmith Bridge across the River Thames. Vehicles have been banned since April 2019 from driving over the west London bridge, after the discovery of cracks in the pedestals of the 135-year-old structure. Reopening hopes were raised this week when the government promised £3m towards the £9m repair costs. Other examples include Park Bridge, in Aberdeenshire, which has been closed since 2019 with an estimated £750,000 repair bill. Drivers are forced to make an 8-mile diversion. Devon has the greatest number of bridges in disrepair – 229 – while Dorset has had the most collapses, at 12. Local authorities said if they had the funds they would have brought 2,374 of the substandard bridges back into full service, but expected to repair only 379 by 2026. The analysis was based on data provided by 196 councils in response to freedom of information requests. It said the cost of addressing the maintenance backlog for all of Britain’s 71,000 council-maintained road bridges would be more than £5.4bn. Steve Gooding, the director of the RAC Foundation, said: “Bridges, as defined by highway engineers, come in all shapes and sizes. But even the failure of the shortest of these structures could mean a 5ft-long gap in the carriageway, and even on relatively minor roads that can still be a headache, causing disruption and possibly a long diversion. Whilst the increase in substandard bridges year-on-year is not huge … with the threat of more severe weather events linked to climate change that must be a worry for the overall resilience of our highway network.” In terms of bridges maintained by national governments, Wales fared worst, with 104 – 8% of its total – identified as substandard. Planning directors said there was a shortage of qualified bridge inspectors and engineers, as well as budget constraints.",News/World news,"More than 3,200 UK bridges need repair, local authorities say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/more-than-3200-uk-bridges-need-repair-local-authorities-say
3/25/2022,"The government has failed to get a handle on excessive salaries paid to academy trust leaders, according to parliament’s spending watchdog, which also criticised the use of tens of millions of pounds in public money to “prop up” poorly managed trusts. According to a report by the Commons public accounts committee, the number of academy trusts paying at least one senior staff member more than £100,000 went up from 1,875 in 2019-20 to 2,245 the following year. Meanwhile, a promised review of high pay by the Department for Education has still not been published. The committee highlighted a lack of transparency surrounding academy finances in its report on the sector, which was published on Friday just days before the DfE is expected to unveil plans to extend its academies programme to eventually include all schools in England. More than half of England’s pupils are educated in academies across 2,700 trusts and about 43% of all state-run schools are academies, which are independent of local authority control. While the majority of secondaries have become academies, primary schools have been more reluctant and there continues to be strong resistance in many communities. MPs on the committee said the sector’s lack of financial transparency undermined parents’ capacity to hold school leaders and the DfE to account, both for their use of public funds and the education they provide. They also accused the DfE of not yet having a sufficient handle on excessive pay within the sector, which meant the department could not assess whether public funds were being well spent. The committee said using public money to prop up academy trusts in difficulty failed to address poor financial management within trusts. An additional £31m in financial support was paid to 81 academy trusts in 2019-20, the majority of which was non-repayable. The following year, the government wrote off £10m of academy debts, including £5m accrued by a single trust. “We are concerned that there is a risk that a trust becomes too big to fail and could therefore see large sums of public funds being pumped into it to keep it afloat,” the report said. At the other end of the scale, there were fears that small schools in rural areas – which may be less attractive to trusts – could become “orphaned”. The report also raised concerns about uneven finances in the academies sector. In the north of England, a far higher proportion of trusts report deficits – 8% compared with 2% in the south-east. Meanwhile some trusts are building up large cash reserves, which may be for specific capital projects, but the DfE does not know so cannot challenge them. The DfE is expected to publish its long-awaited schools white paper early next week, which is expected to focus on the government’s long-held ambition to make all schools academies. Meg Hillier, the committee chair, said: “Parents deserve a lot more visibility and clarity over exactly what is being provided to their children, in what facilities, for the vast amounts of public money pumped into the school system. “This unacceptable lack of transparency and accountability to parents and taxpayers must be resolved before the DfE presses ahead with plans to consolidate all of our schools into academy trust groups.” A DfE spokesperson responded: “Schools across the country continue to have high standards of financial management and governance, with the latest published data showing that 95.9% of academy trusts have balanced accounts. We have set out clear expectations to the sector that academy trust salaries must be justifiable, and we will continue to challenge high pay if it is not proportionate.”",News/Education,MPs accuse DfE of failing to control academy leaders’ excessive salaries,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/25/academy-leaders-excessive-salaries-dfe-mps-committee
3/25/2022,"Anew season! A chance to begin the game again, with some unknown players but with the rules staying the same. As it was for the high society of 19th-century London, gossiping about which rich young men will woo which comely young ladies at this year’s social events, so it is for a hit TV show on its return, tasked with providing the same thing, but different. The writers of Bridgerton, Netflix’s period drama smash, enjoy some knowing puns as their characters spend episode one of the second run wondering what this “new season” will hold. What does it hold? A new protagonist for starters, as per Julia Quinn’s source books, which deal with each of the eight Bridgerton siblings in turn. Eldest daughter Daphne is now married and almost entirely absent, so the pressure is on senior son Anthony, Viscount Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) to get on with picking the best woman in town and converting her into a viscountess. Before he throws himself back on to the carousel of balls, parties and recitals he meets Kate (Simone Ashley), an intriguing stranger with whom he shares a provocative verbal spar, the sort of encounter that truly excites him. Dutifully putting that out of his mind, he rocks up to the first ball of the season and is introduced to Edwina (Charithra Chandran), an impressively capable type who is soon earmarked as the ideal fiancee for a man of Anthony’s stature. Have a guess who Edwina’s older sister is. One need not have consumed a surfeit of novels of manners to know how the love triangle between Anthony, Kate and Edwina will develop, which does not help with the challenge season two faces. Bridgerton is still sweeter and fizzier than rival period dramas, with its sly anachronisms and racially diverse casting making other waistcoat-busters not just set in the past but stuck there. Those things are expected of it now, though, rather than being a pleasant surprise as they were when the show debuted in 2020. We know roughly what we’re getting, so it’s unfortunate that, in the case of this main narrative, we know exactly what we’re getting. What shall be known as the “bee-sting panic attack” scene is one of the less successful attempts to enliven some obvious story beats. We’re also left short of equivalents to the celebrated season-one sex scenes, which, apart from being unusually explicit for the genre and notably focused on the female experience, felt like an integral part of the plot, not merely glacé figs atop a grand confection. They were a product of the original romance, between Phoebe Dynevor as Daphne and sadly departed breakout star Regé-Jean Page as the intense Duke of Hastings, being a heady, horny, impetuous thing – young love, in other words. But now we’re dealing with a tale of emotions clashing with responsibilities that’s more grown up and simply not as fun.That is not to say that the pleasures of Bridgerton have dissipated. It’s still amusing to notice that the string section in the background is playing cover versions of You Oughta Know, Material Girl or, when the queen is awarding the most covetable debutante the title of “diamond”, Diamonds by Rihanna. The gardens are lush, the houses are colossal and there’s some terrific horsing through parkland. Adjoa Andoh continues to excel as Lady Danbury, the all-seeing doyenne of the scene who’s more regal than the actual queen, and is the sort of materteral, flinty maven around whom good period dramas tend to revolve. The rolling subplot about a scandalous gossip pamphlet written by the nonexistent Lady Whistledown also has new energy, in the wake of the season one finale confiding in the audience who this journalistic Pimpernel is. Now we can observe as they try to evade detection, while facing up to the power they wield. Not all the smaller story arcs contribute so effectively, but one that does is that of society refusenik Eloise, whose intellectual curiosity leads her into a romance across class boundaries, crystallised by a lovely take on the trope of two people saying they love each other without saying they love each other. As Eloise, Claudia Jessie remains the funniest presence in a show that could use a dash more outright comedy and a bit less arch sass. In the closing scene, as the players gather for lawn fireworks to celebrate another set of loose ends neatly tied, Bridgerton is in fine health and ready for what will doubtless be many more seasons. Next time, though, it might need to work harder to feel new.",Arts/Television & radio,Bridgerton season two review – back with less fun and far less sex,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/25/bridgerton-season-two-review-back-with-less-fun-and-far-less-sex
3/25/2022,"The Victorian government is being urged to strengthen its rules around political donations, election advertising and lobbying ahead of the November poll. The Centre for Public Integrity on Friday released a discussion paper titled Integrity inadequacies: Victoria, which details how the state’s frameworks are falling short when compared to other jurisdictions. It said that despite substantial improvements to Victoria’s donations laws introduced in 2018, which require donations over $1,050 to be disclosed and capped at $4,210 over four years, the definition is too narrow. Catherine Williams, research director at the Centre for Public Integrity, said payments made at fundraising events were captured by the definition of political donation, but attendance fees were not. “For instance, there may be a dinner where an MP is the headline act and it costs thousands of dollars to attend, but we know that running that dinner doesn’t cost thousands of dollars,” Williams said. “The difference between the cost of running the event and the fee needs to be explicitly captured as a donation. That’s how they do it in New South Wales.” Victoria’s political donation laws also excluded gifts between registered parties and their “nominated entities”, Williams said. The independent thinktank is also calling on the government to introduce a cap on election spending, as is the case in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. The Victorian government has committed to a review of the issue, but that will not take place until after the 26 November election. “We need to level the playing field in relation to elections,” Williams said. “We need to ensure that the ability of candidates to access the electorate is not directly proportionate to their resources. The only way to do that is via the imposition of expenditure caps. “This would also have the benefit of reducing the reliance on donations too.” The state’s lobbying framework was also described as “weak” in the report. In Victoria, ministers and cabinet secretaries can take up lobbying work after 18 months of leaving parliament, while parliamentary secretaries, and executives and staffers can do so in 12 months. But this rule only applies to those who meet the definition of “Government Affairs Director”. Meanwhile, the only penalty lobbyists face for non-complication is re-registration, whereas some other states issue fines and others can pursue criminal prosecution. Ministerial diaries, which show who they have met with, are not published in Victoria, and if a minister is found to have breached their code of conduct, it is a matter left to the premier to enforce. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It’s the same at a federal level, where the code of conduct is only enforceable by the prime minister,” Williams said. “But of course, what premier or prime minister would have an interest in encoding a ministerial code if that would result in attention being drawn to the wrongdoing of its members of government?” Williams said Victoria’s Independent Broad‑based Anti‑corruption Commission has a much more limited jurisdiction than its counterpart in NSW, which has broad powers to investigate any allegation upon suspicion of corruption. This includes alleged substantial breaches of the ministerial and MP codes of conduct. “That’s why Gladys Berejiklian ended up before the Icac, it was because of an allegation of a substantial breach of the ministerial code. That couldn’t happen in Victoria,” she said.",News/Australia news,"Victorian donation, lobbying and political advertising rules need an overhaul, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/victorian-donation-lobbying-and-political-advertising-rules-need-an-overhaul-report-says
3/25/2022,"Assistant defence minister Andrew Hastie has told a court that preserving the Special Air Service regiment requires “coming clean” on the mistakes of the past 15 years, as he declared he was no longer proud of Victorian Cross recipient Ben Roberts-Smith. Hastie, a former captain in the SAS, told the federal court on Friday he had once revered Roberts-Smith – who is suing three newspapers for defamation – but now pitied him. Asked if he hated his former comrade, Hastie told the court: “I don’t dislike Mr Roberts-Smith at all. I pity Mr Roberts-Smith. I pity this whole process. I don’t want to be here.” Hastie was subpoenaed to give evidence by the newspapers defending the defamation action. Roberts-Smith alleges their media reports portrayed him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. In wide-ranging, and at times emotional evidence, Hastie said on Friday confronting “issues” within the SAS was necessary to preserve the regiment, which he said was a vital part of Australia’s national security apparatus. “I have a love for the regiment, I have a love for the institution. My ambition has been to preserve the SAS regiment and the way we do that is by coming clean on some of the mistakes of the last 15 years.” He repeatedly said he was a reluctant witness testifying under subpoena and was not motivated by antipathy towards Roberts-Smith. “Before I gave evidence here, I rang my father and I asked him to pray with me. And he prayed for Mr Roberts-Smith as well.” But, Hastie told the court, having “started from a very high regard” for the decorated veteran, “I am no longer proud of Mr Roberts-Smith”. Hastie told the court of the wider war crimes allegations levelled against Australian soldiers: “This is terrible for our country, terrible for the SAS, terrible for our national security. No one wants to see this but until we deal with it, we can’t move forward.” Hastie, who served five years as a captain in the SAS between 2010 and 2015, said it was a “fairly well-established rumour” within the regiment that Roberts-Smith had kicked an unarmed “PUC” (a person under control in military parlance) off a cliff in Afghanistan. Hastie said he had heard the “Darwan allegation” from “multiple people”. “Soldiers are oral historians – things get passed around by word of mouth.” It is alleged by the newspapers that Roberts-Smith kicked an unarmed, handcuffed prisoner in the chest, sending him falling off a cliff, during an SAS operation in Darwan in 2012. It is alleged the man was later shot on Roberts-Smith’s orders. Roberts-Smith has consistently denied the allegation and said the man killed at Darwan was a spotter, discovered hiding in a cornfield, who was engaged legally and found with a radio on him. He was killed in accordance with the laws of war, Roberts-Smith said in his evidence last year. Hastie was on a mission in October 2012 to Syahchow which the newspapers allege was the site of a “blooding” incident – the practice where a new soldier is initiated into the regiment by being ordered to register their first “kill” on operation, allegedly often of an unarmed prisoner. In their defence claim, the newspapers allege Roberts-Smith ordered another soldier, Person 66, to kill a captive, unarmed Afghan man who’d been taken out into a field. Hastie, on the ground during that mission, said he remembered Roberts-Smith’s patrol using an interpreter to “tactically question” a number of Afghans up against a wall. Moving to a different part of the compound, Hastie said he heard the words “shots fired” and “two Ekia” – enemy killed in action – over the troops’ radio, but that he didn’t hear any shots. He said he later saw Person 66 in the compound at Syahchow “standing slightly off from the rest of the patrol looking nervous”. He testified he also saw Roberts-Smith again on the mission. “Mr Roberts-Smith walked past me … and he looked me in the eye and said ‘Just a couple more dead cunts’,” Hastie said. Hastie was present when Roberts-Smith gave an oral debrief of the mission to senior SAS command. He said Roberts-Smith’s version represented an “alternate universe”. “The reality described by Mr Roberts-Smith was different to the one in actuality.” Hastie said that his own recollection being on the ground – along with information from troop headquarters that observed the mission, radio reports of “shots fired” and “enemy killed in action”, along with his discussions with other soldiers, and reports of another soldier, known as Person 66 “getting a kill” on operation – led him to question the lawfulness of what happened during the Syahchow mission. Roberts-Smith has denied the Syahchow allegation. Asked directly during his evidence last year if he had ordered Person 66 to execute a prisoner, Roberts-Smith said: “I did not.” Person 66 is due to give evidence after Hastie. Hastie told the court Friday he was sufficiently troubled by the “mosaic” of information and reports he had been receiving that he spoke with senior command at the SAS about reports of alleged unlawful behaviour. “I had a gut feeling something wasn’t right.” And, he said, before he led soldiers on deployment to Afghanistan in 2013, he spoke to his subordinates collectively, emphasising the need to obey the laws of war – “to fortify the adherence to ethical and lawful conduct”. “We had a huddle and we made clear what was expected,” he told the court. Hastie told the court he distinctly remembered an experienced non-commissioned officer in the SAS telling him of his command responsibilities: “Your job is not to get these guys to kill, but to restrain them.” Hastie told the court he believed there needed to be “accountability” at all levels of the military. Hastie said Australia’s prosecution of the war in Afghanistan was flawed and the restrictions imposed upon soldiers on the front line endangered Australian lives. “Politicians were sending us over there … and it was bloody ridiculous some of the stuff they were asking us to do.” Hastie said the military’s “catch and release” policy, whereby insurgents captured on operations were often freed after three days by Afghanistan’s judicial system, had “incentivised extrajudicial killing” by coalition troops. “This system incentivises killing rather than capturing.” Hastie said because of stipulations from Canberra, he was required to have 50% of the personnel on missions be from the Afghan army partner force. He said that meant he had to leave behind “medics and engineers” when commanding missions. “So was I a little bit pissed off? Yeah, I was.” Hastie remains in the witness box.

3/25/2022,"As I walked along the coastal path at low tide, I noticed a flock of a dozen or so carrion crows strung out in a line along the foreshore, their glossy black bodies rising and falling like puppets on strings. Edging closer, I could see that the crows had cockles grasped in their bills. Flying to a height of about five metres, they were dropping the shellfish on to the rocky beach below. As the cockles tumbled to the ground, the birds swiftly followed, descending vertically, with wings outstretched and legs dangling. Each bird kept its eyes firmly fixed on its prize, ready to locate it among the flint pebbles and bladderwrack before another member of the flock, or one of the loitering gulls, had the opportunity to steal it. I focused my binoculars on the closest crow. It inspected the fallen cockleshell for damage, deftly flipping it over, then snatched it up and soared back into the sky. The process was repeated twice more. By the third attempt, the shell had cracked enough to expose the vulnerable, soft-bodied prey within. Downing the meaty, protein-packed morsel in one gulp, the bird flew out to the mudflats to forage for another mollusc. At least 23 other species of bird have been observed displaying food-dropping behaviour, including rooks, jackdaws, ravens, golden eagles, ospreys, skuas, herring gulls, great black-backed gulls and Mediterranean gulls, with a wide range of edibles being dropped, from live mammals and shellfish to bones, eggs and nuts. In the case of carrion crows, it is a behaviour most often witnessed in winter and early spring, when other components of their diet such as insects, eggs, seeds and fruit are less abundant. Cockle-dropping allows these clever corvids to exploit a niche usually dominated by specialist feeders such as oystercatchers, which smash or pry the bivalves open with their blade-like bill tips, then cut the muscle that holds the two sides of the shell together. Later, when the crows had dispersed, piles of ribbed shell fragments littered the beach, evidence that the intertidal cockle beds had provided them with rich pickings.
