3/13/2022,"With San Antonio’s 104-102 victory over the Utah Jazz on Saturday night, longtime Spurs coach Gregg Popovich recorded his 1,336th regular-season win to pass Don Nelson for the most in NBA history. Popovich coached Tim Duncan for almost two decades, never missing the playoffs during a span that included five NBA championships. Under his leadership, the Spurs organization became the league standard for professionalism, respectability and doing things the “right way”, a reputation that rubbed off on San Antonio greats like David Robinson, Manu Ginobli, Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker, Avery Johnson, Sean Elliott, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills, DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay and countless others. But what makes Coach Popovich really special, as well as unique, is the way he used his voice and his platform to speak out on injustice, racism, police brutality and the rest of societal ills that plague American society, not only on a daily, personal basis, but a systemic basis. As a white man, in the state of Texas of all places, this not only requires a lot of courage but commands a lot of respect. Pop had a knack for utilizing NBA press conferences and post-game interviews to express his thoughts and opinions on various topics, often without prompting or provocation. After George Floyd was murdered, Coach Popovich’s heartfelt address said what a lot of people needed to hear. “In a strange, counterintuitive sort of way, the best teaching moment of this recent tragedy, I think, was the look on the officer’s face, [during Floyd’s death]. For white people to see how nonchalant, how casual, just how everyday-going-about-his job, so much so that he could just put his left hand in his pocket, wriggle his knee around a little bit to teach this person some sort of a lesson – and that it was his right and his duty to do it, in his mind. “I think I’m just embarrassed as a white person to know that that can happen. To actually watch a lynching. We’ve all seen books, and you look in the books and you see black people hanging off of trees. And you...are amazed. But we just saw it again. I never thought I’d see that, with my own eyes, in real-time.” In 2017, Popovich spoke at length at Spurs media day about systemic racism and politics, saying the country under Trump had become “an embarrassment to the world”: “Obviously, race is the elephant in the room and we all understand that. Unless it is talked about constantly, it’s not going to get better. Why do we have to talk about that?’ Well, because it’s uncomfortable. There has to be an uncomfortable element in the discourse for anything to change. “The disgusting tenure and tone and all the comments … have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic. I live in a country where half the people ignored that to elect someone.” Asked to reflect on the life of Dr Martin Luther King Jr and race relations in the country, part of Popovich’s answer focused on the country’s leadership. “It seems like a lot of roll back in that regard, especially as we look at the race situation in our country. Everybody wants to forget about it but it should be there, front and center, constantly,” Popovich said. “Race is still the unanswered dilemma that everyone continues to ignore. Dr. King did not ignore it, and it’s a big fear now that we have a group in power that is very willing to ignore it. It’s not just with their words, but their actions prove it, and that is scary.” Now. Coach Popovich wasn’t the first and definitely won’t be the last in sports to verbally spank the former US president or call out the blatant and the prevailing racism and bigotry that is currently running rampant not only throughout the Republican Party but America as a whole, yet he’s certainly one of the most important and unique for a number of reasons: 1) Coach Popovich is a graduate of the Air Force Academy and works in a military town. 2) The aforementioned standard that he and the Spurs organization has set would appear to be in direct opposition to his public chastisement of the America. 3) Coach Popovich was making these statements in the ultra-red state of Texas, arguably the most conservative of the conservative states based on the state legislature and the congressional delegation, one that has voted Republican in 10 straight presidential elections and saw 52.6% of voters punch for Trump. For my book Police Brutality and White Supremacy: The Fight Against American Traditions, I interviewed former NBA player Rex Chapman, who is white. He spoke to the power of white people in particular speaking out on injustice. “A big part of it makes me sad that we have to have white people speaking out in order for it to resonate with a lot of white America,” Chapman said. “It hurts my heart when I see my friends Steve Kerr, Steve Nash, Stan Van Gundy, Greg Popovich picking their spots, because they’re still in the NBA. I know the tightrope they do have to walk on some issues, but some of the stuff they’ve said Black people have been saying for decades. I’m proud of them for saying it now Proud to call them my friends. I’m proud to be of the group of white people who genuinely want to be allies in this fight.” The reality is, there are segments of people in America who will give one big collective eye roll to hearing any Black person talk about systemic racism, police brutality, white supremacy, and bigotry. Doesn’t matter if it’s LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick, Barack Obama or anyone else. But they will hear it from someone like Coach Popovich. They will think about it. Reflect on it. And not be immediately offended or dismiss that he is ‘playing the race card’. Coach Popovich said that it’s up to white people to call out racism no matter what the consequences and didn’t even really receive any backlash for his comments, not even in an ultra-conservative place like Texas. And that’s what makes him unique and special. Yes, Popovich’s coaching milestone is historic and worthy of celebration, but his activism off the court will endure longer as the standard for all white people who truly want to be allies in this fight against racism and white supremacy.",Sport/Sport,Gregg Popovich’s biggest win was making America confront uncomfortable truths | Etan Thomas,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/gregg-popovich-legacy-ally-activism-injustice-racism
3/13/2022,"England do not lose often at Twickenham but, perversely, they will remember this defeat with a fair amount of pride. Forced to play with 14 men for 78 minutes of a compelling contest it was only in the closing stages that Ireland pulled away on the scoreboard and it was the home supporters who were on their feet roaring their side onwards for lengthy periods. While four tries to nil may look convincing enough, at no stage were Ireland remotely comfortable until their replacements Jack Conan and Finlay Bealham put an emerald gloss on the margin in the last six minutes. Exactly what might have unfolded had the Bath lock Charlie Ewels not been shown a red card after just 82 seconds is a legitimate debate but the net result is that only Ireland remain in with a shout of this year’s Six Nations title or a Triple Crown. England, for whom this was only their fourth defeat in 39 home games under Eddie Jones, must now go to Paris to try and deny France a ‘Grand Chelem’ and, in doing so, avoid a second consecutive bottom half finish. There was more than enough defiance, though, shown by Maro Itoje, Ellis Genge, Sam Simmonds and a number of their teammates to offer a measure of hope for the medium term future. Top-level sport, though, is about retaining composure and Ewels, on this occasion failed the test when he clattered James Ryan with the game barely begun. As red cards go it was absolutely nailed on, and precisely the kind of upright tackle the sport is trying to eradicate. If the crowd should have been sorry for anyone it was Ryan, led groggily away with his own eagerly-awaited afternoon prematurely ended. The subsequent boos aimed at the referee Mathieu Raynal just went to show how many casual rugby fans still need educating on head injury avoidance and the manner in which the laws have now been tightened to assist that aim. Either way, it was the quickest sending off in championship history and England’s quickest since Mike Burton was dismissed against Australia in 1975 in the infamous Battle of Ballymore. Initially it seemed to be game, set and match. When Ireland, finding alarming space in midfield, worked the ball left and Josh van Der Flier put James Lowe over from 35 metres out past a trailing Max Malins to register Ireland’s first try after just six minutes, every alarm bell in south west London was ringing. Jack Nowell was already having to be deployed as an emergency flanker with the England captain Courtney Lawes shunted back into the second row. When a limping Tom Curry was also forced to leave the fray after just 15 minutes, England were backed even further into a corner, their ability to cover all bases for the rest of the game severely compromised. To their credit there was no disputing the cussedness of the home forwards still on the field. Itoje, sick during the week, looked as pumped up during the anthems as he has ever done, and appeared to be intent on making up for Ewels’s absence on his own. The English scrum was also making some unexpectedly promising headway, with Ireland conceding eight penalties in the first half hour alone. Two safely slotted kicks from three attempts by Marcus Smith dragged England back into contention until, finally, Ireland kept hold of the ball long enough to create some defensive pressure. When England conceded a penalty for a high tackle close to their line Jamison Gibson-Park opted for a quick tap and the equally alert Hugo Keenan came rocketing up from the backfield to stretch and score. In the circumstances a third Smith penalty just before the interval to cut the deficit to 15-9 was as much as England could have wished for. They just had to hope that Ireland would keep shooting themselves in both feet which, for a while, seemed a possibility. New Zealand, in similar circumstances, would have been 30 points clear by the hour mark but the Irish, their confidence at scrum time now seriously dented, were in danger of losing all momentum. The Twickenham crowd could sense it and when another excellent chase by Freddie Steward and Joe Marchant forced the visitors into the concession of another kickable penalty, Smith reduced the gap to just three points with 27 minutes to play. By now the entire stadium had come alive, roaring with delight as Itoje clattered Johnny Sexton following another nicely-judged English up and under. This will be Sexton’s final championship appearance in south-west London and while the continuing possibility of a Triple Crown or, maybe, even more will definitely appeal to him he will not remember this fixture for the quality of the armchair ride. Here, too, was another reminder of why England had won 22 of their previous 25 Six Nations games in their own steepling backyard. They collectively seemed to grow another forest of limbs and, despite changing two thirds of their front row, Ireland’s scrum travails continued. With Will Stuart now at tight-head England made further incursions on Dave Kilcoyne’s side of the scrum and Smith’s fifth penalty brought the scores dramatically level. The place almost erupted when it momentarily looked as if Sexton’s long pass had been picked off by Steward for a potentially game-changing interception try. Alas for England Monsieur Raynal decided England had slowed down the ball at the previous ruck and Sexton’s simple penalty re-established Ireland’s three-point advantage before Conan and Bealham applied the muscular coup de grâce.",Sport/Sport,Ireland hold off England to stay in Six Nations title hunt after Ewels’ early red,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/england-ireland-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report
3/13/2022,"When the Gonski review was released a decade ago, it was hailed as the answer to Australia’s educational woes – a roadmap to creating an equitable school funding system, and boosting the performance of Australian students on the global stage. But rather than celebrating its success, its 10-year anniversary last month sparked critique of the failure of successive governments to implement the report’s recommendations. Despite record levels of funding flowing to Australia’s schools, education results have suffered a 20-year decline on international benchmarks. Meanwhile, a new analysis paints a bleak picture of a widening gap between advantaged and disadvantaged schools, with commonwealth and state funding for private schools increasing at nearly five times the rate of public school funding over the decade to 2019-20. Education experts now warn that the vision enshrined in the review will only be realised if the commonwealth and states unite to end the “defrauding” of public schools and fully fund them to their needs-based benchmark. Ahead of next year’s expiry of the current state-federal funding deal, the National School Reform Agreement, experts say there must be a coordinated effort to ensure Gonski’s vision is realised.  In 2010, businessman David Gonski was engaged by the Rudd government to lead a review into Australia’s school funding, with the aim of reducing the impact of social disadvantage on educational outcomes, and ending inequities in the distribution of public money. The report was released in February 2012, during Julia Gillard’s prime ministership. The reforms recommended that governments reduce payments to overfunded schools that didn’t need them and redirect funds on a needs-based model. Its key recommendation was the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) – a base rate of funding per student with additional loading for disadvantage factors such as Indigenous heritage. The SRS would determine the required funding needed for each school. But a decade on, most public schools are yet to reach their full funding according to their SRS and more funding has gone to the less needy schools, with non-government schools well above their benchmark. Gonski said the system would “ensure that differences in educational outcomes are not the result of differences in wealth, income, power or possessions” when he delivered his findings to government in 2011. Trevor Cobbold, an economist and national convenor for public school advocacy group Save Our Schools, says the failure to achieve the review’s goals was a result of failures by the Gillard government and those that followed to implement the report’s recommendations. “Gonski didn’t fail. It is governments that failed Gonski, and thereby failed disadvantaged students,” he says. “You have to construct a system that recognises both the commonwealth and state roles, and Gonski did this by designing a nationally integrated model on a needs-basis.” Cobbold argues the Gonski reforms were only “partially implemented” by the Gillard government because the former prime minister was constrained by her own commitment that no school would lose a dollar of funding. He also points to Gillard’s deal with Catholic Church that its schools would maintain their existing share of education funding – an arrangement that was extended to independent schools. When the Turnbull government passed needs-based education funding legislation in 2017, it wasn’t projected to be achieved for at least a decade. The legislation was based on the review’s key recommendation of a SRS. Under the reform, overfunded independent schools would have their funding brought down to the SRS benchmark by 2029 while underfunded public schools would have their funding increased over the same period. But the funding projections show public schools in all states except the ACT would be funded at only 91% or less of their SRS until at least 2029. More recently, “funding deals” the Morrison government established for private schools outside of the needs-based model – designed to soften the financial impact for non-government schools during the transition to a new funding model – further undermined the plan. Tom Greenwell, a Canberra-based teacher and co-author of Waiting for Gonski – How Australia Failed its Schools, says a “huge problem” is that the “real work of additional funding has always been delayed beyond the forward estimates, to the next funding agreement”. “Needs-based funding needs to be delivered now,” he says. Dr Glenn Savage, an education reform researcher at the University of Western Australia, agrees that the Gonski reform never delivered the needs-based funding model that it initially set out to deliver. “The fundamentals of the system have never been addressed,” he says. “The large amount of money that goes to the independent and Catholic schools has never really been under threat as a result of Gonski.” Under the current school funding agreement struck in 2019, the commonwealth contributes 80% of the SRS for private schools, while state governments are responsible for the remaining 20%. The split is reversed for public schools, but the states’ minimum “formal target” for public schools is only 75% despite the Turnbull government originally proposing 80%. The agreement also allows state governments to include SRS contributions on items not originally deemed part of the Gonski benchmark, such as depreciation and transport. Cobbold says these “loopholes” contribute to under-funding and further drag down the contributions to government schools. The states have argued the funding deal forced them to increase their education budgets by hundreds of millions of dollars, and have accused the commonwealth of failing to enact a more collaborative approach to funding rather than a one-size-fits-all scheme. While neither of the major parties have yet sought to make education funding a core policy area for the upcoming election, whoever wins will be tasked with negotiating a new school reform funding agreement with the states and territories. Cobbold says the current bilateral funding deal, which is due to expire in December 2023, must end the “defrauding” of the public school system, and require states to step up their contributions. Savage agrees that “it’s the states that are letting public schools down”.“We have the state saying to parents: ‘If your child goes to a private school in this state, they deserve to be fully funded under the Gonski model. If they go to public school, they don’t deserve to be fully funded.’ And what kind of message is that sending about how governments value private schools relative to public schools in our nation?” Pete Goss, who leads PwC Australia’s school education consulting practice, says the next step must be determining how to get federal and state governments to lift funding for government schools “back up to our national promise” of the SRS. “Lifting government schools up to the full Gonski funding would be worth more than a $1,000 per student per year,” he said. “At all levels of government at this point, we’d need a joint commitment to lift per student funding of government schools, so that it was in line with our national promise.” The parameters of the 80-20 state-commonwealth funding split could be renegotiated in the next funding deal. Victoria, for example, agreed in 2019 to lift its contribution towards the SRS from 67% – the nation’s lowest per-student funding level – to 75% over 10 years. The state’s education minister, James Merlino, says the commonwealth should fund the final 5% of the SRS for government schools. But, as Goss says, “a school doesn’t care where a dollar comes from”.",News/Australia news,The Gonski ‘failure’: why did it happen and who is to blame for the ‘defrauding’ of public schools?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/13/the-gonski-failure-why-did-it-happen-and-who-is-to-blame-for-the-defrauding-of-public-schools
3/13/2022,"It’s hard to forget the sight of Joanna Newsom being attacked by a swarm of crickets onstage. Back in March 2011 Adelaide had been beset by a freak cricket plague, and the American songwriter’s Womadelaide set saw insects ricochet off her hair and harp strings as she valiantly held it together in front of a small orchestra. “Y’all there are bugs up here,” she exclaimed, telling the crowd they were flying into her mouth and eyes before battling on with a smirk. While the crunchy chaos of that night has never quite been repeated, such unexpectedly memorable moments have become par for the course over Womadelaide’s 30 year history. There were no guarantees the festival would even make it that far when it debuted. Launched as part of 1992’s Adelaide festival program, it was to be the first Australian offshoot of the UK-based Womad festival series, founded by Peter Gabriel in 1980 as a unifying response to the fear and division of the Cold War. Even the festival’s Botanic Park location, whose outdoor charm – and in recent years, colony of shrieking fruit bats – have become key to Womadelaide’s character, was a last minute fix. A plan to hold it in a national park in the Adelaide hills came unstuck when festival director Ian Scobie noticed the approaching bushfire season. “I thought, ‘Hmm, I wonder what happens if there’s a fire ban?’” Scobie tells Guardian Australia. “I rang our contact and he said, ‘Oh, the park would close — no ifs, no buts’.” With the programs already printed, and Scobie feeling increasingly “green about the gills”, he scrambled to find an alternative. “I got in my car and drove around; I looked at Gregory’s street directory — it had all the green areas of the city — and I thought I’d just circle around and see if there’s anywhere.” The show went on, with a 26-act lineup led by Crowded House, Paul Kelly, Archie Roach, Senegal’s Youssan D’or, and Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. They’ve all returned to the festival over the years, part of an extended family of legacy performers that helped cement a formula of the familiar and the unexpected – for both audiences and artists. “[International artists] knew of Australia, but for many of them it was a complete revelation to finally get here,” Scobie says of the early days. For audiences, Womad offered an uncommon opportunity to experience a global cross-section of styles and artistry rarely found in one place. “People didn’t have YouTube, they didn’t know what to expect — that was a fascinating thing, to see that exchange develop.” The festival returned in 1993 as its own standalone biannual event, this time headlined by Gabriel and Yothu Yindi. For a time, the off-years were filled by an eclectic run of spinoff events: archival photos, dusted off for the 30th anniversary, recall a Womad Indian Pacific train tour held during Barrie Kosky’s 1996 Adelaide festival, in which Roach and Kelly led a dozen artists on a 2,000km trip across the Nullarbor. They finished up in Pimba, 480km north of Adelaide, where an all-star passenger list including Tanzanian guitarist Remmy Ongala, India’s Purna Das Baul and Cameroon’s Francis Bebey performed on a makeshift stage outside Spud’s Roadhouse. Roach remembers the trip fondly: “What I loved … was when we stopped at Pimba to perform a concert. It was not far from Woomera. A lot of Ruby’s family came to that show,” he says, referring to his late partner and collaborator Ruby Hunter. “When we were getting off stage all these old people swamped Ruby. They told her they were family through her grandfather — I thought that was beautiful. Ruby was overjoyed meeting her Pitjantjatjara and Kokatha family.” Over the years the festival has welcomed a long list of music legends, some of whom, like Hunter and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, are no longer with us. There were Yolŋu songwriter Gurrumul’s two appearances, American protest poet Gil Scott-Heron, influential Sierra Leone guitarist S.E. Rogie, and US country great John Prine. Others, like Salif Keita, Angélique Kidjo, Richard Thompson, Jimmy Cliff and Mavis Staples have kept coming back. It also played host to a 90-year-old Ravi Shankar and his daughter Anoushka, as the master sitarist bid farewell to Australia shortly before his death (Anoushka later returned in 2018 to keep the tradition alive). In 2018, French circus troupe Gratte Ciel’s aerial piece Place des Anges saw a tonne of white duck feathers dropped onto the crowd each night by zip-lining acrobats. A beautiful, hectic sight, it nonetheless courted minor controversy among vegans and asthmatics — and left the park looking like the scene of an avian massacre come morning. Another memorable moment came in 2019, when First Dog On The Moon appeared in the Planet Talks program and playfully outlined how swiftly a new pandemic might spread around the globe. On Friday, the festival returned to Botanic Park for the first time since March 2020 (last year Roach led a seated, Covid-safe concert series at an alternate venue). While its overseas Womad counterparts have been virtually mothballed, this proudly internationalist music festival has pushed on by embracing the diversity within Australia’s borders. The 2022 headliners include perennial Womadelaide favourites such as Paul Kelly, Baker Boy and the Cat Empire, but the weekend will also include appearances from South Sudan’s “King of Music” Gordon Koang, Malyangapa and Barkindji rapper Barkaa, and Punjabi Australian singer Parvyn. But on Friday night, over on a smaller stage, Melbourne-based trio Glass Beams played in Adelaide for the first time. As the masked group mined a vein of ethereal dance music inspired by Shankar and 70s Indian disco, something happened to the crowd; at first they were sprawled out on the grass, but then a few people near the front tentatively rose to their feet. Then a few more, and a few more. State government restrictions on dancing expired at midnight, but the festival had been given a few hours’ head start — allowing it to once again live up to the promise of its acronym: World of Music and Dance. As fruit bats circled overhead, the park turned into a dancefloor — and that 30-year-old dream was alive again.

3/13/2022,"Australia’s lax money laundering laws mean the nation is at risk of becoming a haven for Russian cash belonging to oligarchs who are seeking to avoid sanctions over the war in Ukraine, experts say. The country is one of only three – along with Haiti and Madagascar – yet to commit to bringing lawyers, accountants and real estate agents under the umbrella of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws (AML-CTF). Having failed to act on a promise it made eight years ago to bring the professions into the AML-CTF system, the government now faces a race against time to take action before global authorities put Australia on a “grey list” of countries that don’t meet international standards – a move experts say would embarrass the nation, damage its banks and make it harder for companies to raise money overseas. “We have just in the last couple of weeks, through the processes we follow, managed to identify a few Russian entities with money in this space,” says Andrew Jackson, who is the Australian head of First AML, a company that provides customer screening and other anti-money laundering services. “Now whether they are legitimate or not, I don’t know,” he says. “It is an appealing area for someone from Russia right now. I think some of the sanctions that have been put in place are making it harder, but yes, if we don’t have wider legislation, we are always going to be running the risk that people who need to move illegal funds around look at Australia, because it’s just an easier target.” The head of the AML-CTF compliance group Initialism, Neil Jeans, says Australia is “absolutely” vulnerable to exploitation by sanctions-busters “because you have, effectively, a significant proportion of the gatekeepers or enablers basically, not required to know who their customers are”. “It’s pretty easy to create a complex layered structure that would be pretty difficult to penetrate by any one country,” Jeans says. “That’s the whole modus operandi of this activity – and I’ve been investigating it since the early 1990s.” Jackson says money laundering has real consequences for ordinary Australians. People could be “sitting in a pub out in western Sydney and the pokies room behind them could have a group of people running $50,000 through the pokies in one evening, laundering their money”, he says. “How do they draw the line between money laundering and the fact they can’t afford a house in Australia because the prices have gone up?” Russia’s war on Ukraine has rung alarm bells at the Paris headquarters of the global body that sets AML-CTF standards, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), where member nations – including Australia – met last week. It called for a new register of beneficial ownership to penetrate the jumble of companies and trusts used to prevent authorities from knowing who owns what. Under Australian law, businesses including financial institutions and gambling operators are required to report large or suspicious transactions to Austrac, the country’s financial intelligence agency, and perform “know your customer” checks to make sure they know the real source of client money. Failure to meet these obligations can be very expensive – Westpac paid a record $1.3bn fine in 2020 to settle Austrac allegations it breached reporting laws more than 23m times, including by failing to conduct proper due diligence on customers sending money to south-east Asia in a way consistent with child exploitation. While Crown Resorts is currently in court facing allegations by the regulator that it breached the law 547 times. In 2014, Australia promised to meet the FATF’s recommendation to bring lawyers, accountants and real estate agents into the AML-CTF regime. It is now the only developed country that has failed to do so. The failure is “a neon sign flashing above the continent of Australia saying ‘haven for criminal money laundering’,” says Deborah O’Neill, a Labor senator who has been active in a Senate committee inquiry into the adequacy of Australia’s AML-CTF laws. She says in 2015 Australia learned that Chinese nationals were “very actively engaged in moving money in ways that were sight unseen through Australia”. “We didn’t find out for ourselves,” she says. “We found out from the Chinese, they told us we were a laundry. We do not have vision of this because of the government’s failure to do it.” Recent submissions from accountants and real estate agents to the inquiry indicate they are resigned to having to do some sort of reporting. But lawyers have consistently maintained their blanket opposition, saying the rules regulating their profession are adequate. Bringing lawyers into the scheme, “would impermissibly undermine fundamental tenets of the law, such as legal professional privilege and confidentiality,” and, “impose disproportionate costs on the profession and clients at large which in turn would likely restrict the provision of, and access to, legal services,” the Law Council of Australia said in a submission. Jackson says law firms “shouldn’t want to work with anybody who is potentially laundering money”. “Yes, there will be a little bit of extra due diligence that they have to do, but that’s something they should be proud to do,” he says. “Is it going to be a cost for some people? Yes. But this is a cost of doing good.” Jeans says other countries with similar rules about the relationship between lawyers and clients have brought lawyers into AML-CTF laws and “the sky hasn’t fallen in”. “Quite frankly, the arguments being offered by the Law Council of Australia are probably the same arguments that I’ve heard in the US, I’ve heard in the UK, and Europe and virtually everywhere else in the world, for the last 20 years,” he says. There have been industry rumours that the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, might rush to put legislation before parliament in the handful of sitting days available before the election that is due before 21 May, but government sources say that is unlikely because the changes required are complex and need proper industry consultation. “The government has been clear in condemning the actions of the Russian government and is committed to a strong and effective sanctions regime, including ensuring that ill-gotten gains and other sanctioned wealth is effectively targeted by Austrac,” a spokesperson for Andrews said. “As our economy recovers from the pandemic it’s important we consult with stakeholders and take the time to get further reforms right.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning However, if FATF evaluators aren’t convinced Australia is moving in the right direction, the country could end up on the grey list, with jurisdictions including the Cayman Islands, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, that have “strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing”. “This would push all the Australian banks into the high risk category of banks that you’re doing business with, which would mean there’ll be heightened due diligence on providing correspondent banking relationships for them, so therefore, there’ll be a lot more work for the Australian banks,” Jeans says. He says it would also hurt investment into Australia, which has long relied on streams of foreign capital. “I’m an investor in a fund, do I really want to put money into a country that’s on the grey list?” Jeans asks. “Do I want to invest in that enterprise?”",News/Australia news,Weak money laundering laws put Australia at risk of becoming a haven for Russian cash,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/13/weak-money-laundering-laws-put-australia-at-risk-of-becoming-a-haven-for-russian-cash
3/13/2022,"The former SAS soldier Ben Roberts-Smith, who is facing allegations of war crimes, was a “mentor” to Zachary Rolfe, the Northern Territory police officer who was cleared on Friday of murdering Kumanjayi Walker. The relationship between the two men, who have been at the centre of separate trials that have dominated the media for more than a month, is detailed in a statement by Rolfe’s mother, Debbie, submitted to court as part of Roberts-Smith’s case. According to Rolfe’s mother’s June 2021 statement, Roberts-Smith had been kind and helpful to her son since they met in 2011. Debbie Rolfe, a prominent Canberra lawyer and philanthropist, provided the statement as part of Roberts-Smith’s defamation case. In an extraordinary coincidence, the defamation trial in New South Wales and Rolfe’s murder trial in the Northern Territory have run concurrently for the past five weeks. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Debbie Rolfe writes in the statement that she first met Roberts-Smith in about March 2011 when she was in a Canberra store with Zach and her husband, Richard. “We spoke and ‘connected’ straight away in part because Zach had recently joined the Australian Army,” Debbie Rolfe said. “My husband and I thereafter met Ben, and his [then] wife Emma [Roberts], through my husband’s work for the Australian War Memorial and Soldier On, and our families subsequently became good friends.

3/13/2022,"War in Ukraine has not interfered with the Australian right’s tireless prosecution of domestic culture war. Indeed many have simply seized on the Russian invasion as a way to add a new flavour to attacks on their perceived domestic adversaries. Given that the Australian left has nothing to do with the ongoing conflict, this has required the writers to torture logic to within an inch of its life. Peta Credlin, writing in the Australian, was just one of those who looked at Ukrainians’ defence of their country, then posited an entirely hypothetical invasion of Australia, decided that her compatriots would not be capable of such tenacity, and proffered this as proof of her country’s complacency. Credlin claimed that the invasion showed that we need “to dump our politically correct preoccupations”. Somewhat astoundingly, she contended that “the most obvious rethink the security crisis should prompt is the west’s response to climate change”. She claimed that European dependence on Russian gas should lead the west to double down on its dependence on imported carbon-based fuel, since reducing emissions would constitute “one-sided economic disarmament”. Having drawn this longest of bows, she then complained about “the internal culture wars that western countries seem always to be fighting” as a “unilateral moral disarmament” to which the only solution is a steadfast nationalism. In the same pages, Greg Craven also claimed that Australians would not be up to the job of defending the country from an imaginary invasion. His evidence included the response to the Covid-19 epidemic which had revealed “a nation of bed wetters”, the growth of the #MeToo movement, and leftwing virtue-signalling. His solutions? A nationalistic civics program and the timeless rightwing standby, national service. In the Daily Telegraph, Erin Molan also doubted the capacity for Australia’s “young adults” to muscle up to an entirely fictional invasion. While on “climate change policies, gender issues or Indigenous affairs, they gather, march, protest and post (on social media of course) with the kind of bravado and uncompromising resolve we might recognise in ... Ukrainian youth”, unfortunately the “focus of much of their lives, including time spent at school, seems to be on what is terrible about this country, how we have failed and all the ways in which we continue to do so”. Given all of these grim reports of our failure to repel a non-existent invasion due to the corrupting influence of leftist cultural values, it was amusing to read once-popular blogger Tim Blair’s phoned-in objections to leftists shoehorning their “woke obsessions” like climate change into commentary on the invasion. It’s possible to raise obvious objections to all of this. If the west reduced its dependence on fossil fuels, whatever leverage Putin has over western Europe would be greatly diminished. Ukraine’s low vaccination rate, the outflow of refugees, and war conditions are likely to greatly complicate the impact of the conflict, so the idea that their heroic defence of their country somehow exposes the folly of robust public health measures is entirely backwards. And on the “woke” front, the relatively liberal framework of LGBTQ and women’s rights in Ukraine vis-a-vis Russia, where they are persecuted, is a source of acute concern for young Ukrainians, many of whom are organising to help the armed forces because they see Russia as a threat to their hard-won rights. There’s a reason that so many on the far right in the west are barracking for Putin in this war: they see him as a leader who is pushing back on the liberal freedoms that LGBTQ people, women and others have won in the west. There’s also the fact that Australia is not being invaded, and that this is not remotely on the cards. But the Australian right’s opinion division is impervious to sense, so these objections are mainly useful as a reminder to ourselves. History, facts and context simply don’t figure in their ceaseless prosecution of culture war, and their constant struggle to pull Australian politics to the right. This effort is as unimaginative and unthinking as it is amoral. A detailed understanding of the conflict in Ukraine would be a hindrance. The calamity of a foreign invasion is simply grist for their mill. Jason Wilson is a columnist for Guardian Australia",Opinion/Opinion,Dragging Russia’s invasion into Australia’s culture war is as unimaginative as it is amoral | Jason Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/12/dragging-russias-invasion-into-australias-culture-war-is-as-unimaginative-as-it-is-amoral
3/13/2022,"Two groups of politicians have looked at the burning hospitals and ravaged cities and thought: “This is the ideal opportunity to advance my career by lying about a merciless imperial war.” The first consists of Vladimir Putin and his organised crime gang. The second consists of Boris Johnson and his ministers. If – and I hope when – Putin’s gangsters face trial, they will plead that the boss gave them no choice. If Sergei Lavrov does not pretend the war is not a war and “we have not even attacked Ukraine”, he will lose his job and maybe more than his job as Putinism turns into Stalinism. Russia is now behaving as if 1989 never happened. The few Russians with the courage to speak out risk 15 years in jail for publishing “fake news” (or “telling the truth”, as the rest of us would say). No one threatened to lock up Priti Patel if she refused to mislead parliament. She was not saving herself from the sack when she told MPs she had set up a visa application centre for Ukrainian refugees in Calais, when no such centre existed. No secret policemen will interrogate Patel on the origins of the sick rumour that streams of Ukrainians running for their lives “may” be riddled with Russian agents . (Pause for a moment to admire the cynical cleverness of the smear. No one can conclusively disprove it.) Patel could tell her honourable counterparts in Dublin that she worried that Ireland’s decision to welcome refugees could allow them to reach the UK by the back door, and then toddle off to her safe home and warm bed, and enjoy a sleep undisturbed by nightmares. Come to that, no one bullied Grant Shapps into allowing a sly smirk to suffuse his puffy face as he announced that the Conservatives were following the express wishes of Volodymyr Zelenskiy when they denied sanctuary to Ukrainian women and children. For who would punish them? They were simply riffing on a cracked tune sung by Boris Johnson when he told a straight lie (again) and asserted: “The UK is way out in front in our willingness to help refugees.” The trouble with liars is they force you to waste everyone’s time by stating the obvious. So for the record, and as I’m sure you know, the EU gave freedom of movement to all Ukrainians, while Johnson and Patel insisted on visa restrictions. Nowhere in Europe is as small as Global Britain. Two forces have driven the abandonment of our allies and the denial of common humanity: the bureaucratic ineptitude of the Home Office and the calculations of the Conservative leadership. The Home Office is an institutionalised absurdity. You can only make sense of it if you’re drunk. In theory, it believes in a “hostile environment” that makes life so miserable for migrants they would think twice before coming here. In practice, the hostile environment does not work even on its own mean-spirited terms. The untutored might think a hostile environment meant deporting migrants whose asylum claims failed. But the rate of enforced deportation has collapsed under Patel to the lowest level since records began in 2004. All that is left is her determination to use every Kafkaesque ploy to stop asylum seekers reaching the UK unless they have been through an authorised government scheme and force them into a 100,000-strong queue of applicants if they make it through. The determination to control means the Home Office must pay for accommodation, while its processes grind on full stop. The Treasury is sick of meeting the bill and is insisting on economies. Given the cost controls, the Home Office under its current policies may not be able to afford a Ukrainian refugee influx. Financially, morally and practically, the hostile environment is a farce. But here is the point you may find hard to grasp – the Home Office doesn’t care. In 2016, the chief inspector of borders reported that senior Home Office managers had told him they were unlikely to change policy even if there was no reduction in the number of asylum seekers entering the UK. Inflicting pain was “the right thing to do”, they said … The public would not accept asylum seekers receiving “the same range of benefits and services” British citizens enjoyed. They must suffer. If puritanism is the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy, conservatism is the haunting fear that some claimants, somewhere, may be comfortable. Conservative policy towards refugees is driven by the same crabbed and punitive moralism that led the Victorians to build workhouses. To add to their absurdist atmosphere, Patel is presenting a nationality and borders bill to parliament that will criminalise Ukrainian refugees who cross the Channel without her permission. The spectacle of Tory MPs, who have denounced Russia and praised the resistance, voting to treat Putin’s victims as villains will test all but the strongest stomachs. A home secretary and prime minister with empathy and political will could have cleared the obstacles and forced the bureaucracy to relent. The government was generous to Hongkongers fleeing the Chinese communist takeover, after all. But that was because the Foreign Office drove the policy. Ukraine has been left to Johnson and Patel and they believe their supporters are racist. The decision of the 1997-2010 Labour government to allow the largest mass migration in UK history destroyed it, they reason. The failure of the Cameron government to contain migration led to the Brexit vote and Ukip threatening to supplant the Conservative party. They think that if they forget their base’s xenophobia for a moment, they will suffer the same fate. Downing Street and the Home Office can beat the most elitist Remainer in their contempt for working-class Conservatives. They assume they are thick and prejudiced, even when those same supporters say they are nothing of the sort. Opinion polls may show 76% of the public want Ukrainian refugees to be allowed into the country. Conservative politicians and journalists may berate the government’s heartlessness and mendacity as forcefully as any leftist. Johnson and Patel don’t believe they mean it. George Bernard Shaw said: “The liar’s punishment is not in the least that he is not believed, but that he cannot believe anyone else.” The liars at the top of government cannot believe the electorate. They are certain that their power depends on thinking the worst of the British.

3/13/2022,"“A city is a language, a repository of possibilities,” wrote Rebecca Solnit in her 2002 book Wanderlust. “And walking is the act of speaking that language, of selecting from those possibilities.” Solnit was writing about the act of walking, broadly, but could have been commenting on urban walking tours which, if you hadn’t noticed, have changed. No longer the pedestrian version of the double-decker sightseeing bus, walking tours are eschewing the major landmarks for smaller, cooler and harder-to-find spots. Walking tours are social, active and if they’re outdoors, relatively Covid safe. You can explore your own city through another’s eyes or discover something new when visiting an interstate capital. In short – they’re very 2022. There are First Nations-operated tours in most Australian cities. From The Rocks Aboriginal Dreaming Tour (Illi Langi) in Sydney, to short walks in Melbourne’s centre with the Koorie Heritage Trust, to Brisbane’s BlackCard cultural tours where “no subject is taboo”. In Darwin, Larakia culture comes care of a Saltwater Cultural Tour, while in Canberra Dhawura Tours focuses on the nearby mountains. Perth’s Nyungar Tours does short walks in south Perth and Kings Park, and takara nipaluna is the first and only Aboriginal tour of Hobart. Melbourne offers the most varied perambulations. For starters, there is Fashion by Foot’s exploration of ethical independent designers. Then there’s the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art’s Six Walks, with audio guides supplied by writers including Tony Birch and Christos Tsiolkas, crafting paths around themes such as motherhood, colonisation and surveillance. But everyone already knows Melbourne is cool. For visitors to Perth, a tour with Oh Hey WA verges on compulsory. “I only give first-hand recommendations,” says founder Adie ​​Chapman. “I am immersed in the culture, I go out a lot!” Perth’s liquor licences which don’t require bars to serve food in order to serve alcohol, have seen small bars flourish. That is, if you can find them. You enter Alfred’s Pizza through a phone box on Barrack street, while music venue Lucy’s Love Shack is underground. The very secret bar Sneaky Tony’s (speakeasy-themed) is accessed from a grimy car park. Once there, if you quietly ask the bartender, “is Tootsie here?”, as Chapman knew to do, they’ll show you a second secret bar (disco-themed) down a dark hallway. “Just before Covid, Perth was exploding,” says Chapman. “People were coming into the city, plus there was the new Perth to London flight. All the hotels opened and then bang! Covid. The Novotel opened up into a quarantine hotel.” Walking tours are putting a new spin on old things too. In Canberra, She Shapes History tells you the stories of the diverse women behind Australia’s defining moments. While in Sydney, the Renaissance Tours women’s history walk wanders around Kings Cross (once called Queens Cross) – a place “most Sydneysiders think they know the story of,” says travel journalist and guide Ute Junker. “It’s usually the male history we know, from the 1940s onwards,” she says. “A couple of blokes will spring up on today’s tour but we’ll try to keep them in their box.” Junker does just that when we hear about writer, activist, Spanish translator, utopian socialist and $10 note model, Mary Gilmore. Gilmore was a contemporary of poets Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson. But Junker says Lawson was “often too drunk to write” and Paterson “didn’t write anything too interesting after he was about 40 or 50”. Gilmore, meanwhile, wrote a newspaper column until she was 97 years old. As a professional tourist herself, Junker knows a good script isn’t a straight knowledge transfer. We have air-conditioned homes and Wikipedia for that. Walkers want fun, like-minded company and usually a meal and a drink. Which is another trend the new breed of walking tours has grown in synergy with: everyone’s a foodie now. Some of Sydney’s best food tours are in suburbs that many self-declared gastronomes have likely never seen, let alone dined in. Social enterprise Taste Cultural Food Tours hosts walks such as Taste of Migration in Bankstown, Taste of Afghanistan and Syria in Merrylands, and Taste of Korea in Eastwood. In Melbourne, a Hidden Secrets tour takes you to spots that, despite being a few years old, still feel new, as some were open just a few days between lockdowns. Foodie Trails runs a CBD masala tour, as well as trips to Oakleigh and Footscray for Greek and African cuisine. Adelaide’s Flamboyance Tours takes you to Haigh’s and the famous central market for Adelaidean oddities such as frog cake and fritz. In the Top End the Darwin Gourmet Food Tour canvasses the city’s best restaurants, while Walk Brisbane runs a private laneways and cafes tour to prove its claim that “the best coffee is never on the main street”. Back in Sydney, at the new Kings Cross Distillery hosted by “gin architect” Odelia Potts, Junker tells us how the artist Rosaleen Norton – who was dubbed the “witch of Kings Cross” – was hounded into homelessness by the NSW police vice squad for her apparent links to the occult. “Rosaleen is the only artist in Australia to have her art destroyed by order of the court,” says Junker. “[Her paintings] remind me of James Gleeson’s and no one was accusing him of dark arts.” Earlier in the tour, we’d stood before the worker’s cottage where heiress, journalist and activist Juanita Nielsen lived until her suspected murder in 1975. Of Nielsen’s involvement with the city-defining Green Bans, Junker says: “I always thought [the Green Bans] were a fight for architecture but she reframed it as a fight for community.” It’s a simple but inspiring insight into a city where the losses to developers are stacking up. Near the worker’s cottage a brass plaque is embedded in the footpath, stating that Nielsen was “not afraid whose toes she tramped on”. I’ve probably tramped over this plaque hundreds of times – yet never read it. But I do today. ***All walks listed should be checked by contacting the tour company as many operators are still responding to unpredictable demand and Covid restrictions.

3/13/2022,"Vivienne Kane is part of a group of 70 volunteers writing letters to the editor in order to unseat the federal treasurer. The 64-year-old lives in Kooyong, the electorate held by Josh Frydenberg since 2010. She is volunteering for Prof Monique Ryan, the head of neurology at the Royal Children’s Hospital Melbourne, who was endorsed by the community advocacy group Voices of Kooyong to stand in the seat. “I feel as though the independent movement actually has a genuine opportunity to attract the centre, and they’re the people that swing elections,” Kane says. Ryan is one of 21 “Voices of” candidates to have announced their run for a lower house seat for the 2022 federal election, and more are expected to follow. In six Liberal-held seats – Wentworth, North Sydney, Kooyong, Goldstein and Curtin – they have emerged as the main opposition. The grassroots campaigns have attracted tens of thousands of people across Australia, many of whom have never volunteered for a political cause before. At least 13 lower house candidates and three in the Senate have received donations from Climate 200, founded by the Melbourne philanthropist Simon Holmes à Court, which has raised $7m to support independents who align with its key policy priorities – supporting evidence-based action on climate change, an integrity commission and donation reforms, and gender equality. Government MPs are feeling the pressure. In the Melbourne bayside seat of Goldstein, where the former ABC foreign correspondent Zoe Daniel has amassed thousands of supporters, the Liberal MP Tim Wilson complained to the local council that residents were prematurely displaying signs in support of his opponent, and also encouraged people to dob in neighbours with signs to receive a $1,000 fine. The Queensland senator Matt Canavan has described the independents’ movement as “not authentic” and “not true locals”. And in Sydney, Wentworth MP Dave Sharma, who is facing a challenge from independent Allegra Spender, claimed that Climate 200 was “outspending anyone” on political advertising. Guardian Australia spoke to volunteers and candidates from “Voices of” campaigns across three states. The groups had different organisational structures and different funding rules. Some held public votes on independent candidates, some conducted an unofficial nomination process, and some decided not to endorse a candidate at all. At least two groups have split and are fielding competing independent candidates. But all said they were motivated to act because they were disillusioned with the current political system and frustrated above all by lack of action on climate change. In most cases, the path to political action went something like this. They saw Zali Steggall handily defeat Tony Abbott in the northern Sydney seat of Warringah at the 2019 election. The 2019-20 bushfires dialled their concern about the climate emergency up to 11. They heard a talk by the former Indi MP Cathy McGowan, or listened to the interview she did with the ABC’s Richard Fidler. And then they went online and started looking for opportunities to act. McGowan says the bushfires were a turning point in the willingness of communities to put up with what they saw as poor representation. “Before then the whole debate had been polarised, and in the regions people were really reluctant to get involved in a climate debate. But it totally changed after those bushfires … I really think the community tolerance of climate inaction bubbled over in 2020.” The ABC’s election analyst, Antony Green, says those caught by surprise by the wave of progressive independents have usually erred in viewing the climate emergency as an issue of the left, rather than one that concerns voters on all sides. “There are a series of issues that Liberal voters will be interested in like individual liberty, human rights, climate change,” Green says. “They don’t sit on the left-right spectrum in the same way that other issues do, like the economy or union membership or wages and conditions or interest rates.” McGowan agrees. “In the country you used to get accused of being a greenie, and that was a bad thing. A lot of that’s actually changed over the last couple of years, and being a greenie is not the derisive political cutting line that it used to be.” Kane is a swinging voter. She owns a small printing business with her husband, and might be expected to vote Liberal. But she says she despairs at Australia’s failure to grasp the economic opportunities that could come from transitioning to a carbon-neutral economy. “There are huge economic possibilities and we are missing out on all of those, and we’ll end up living in a much poorer country if we don’t do something about it,” she says. “Climate change is the thing that worries me the most because everything else becomes redundant if we all fry and burn.” She decided to volunteer on the night of the 2019 election, when high-profile campaigns by two progressive challengers – independent Oliver Yates and the barrister Julian Burnside, who ran for the Greens – halved Frydenberg’s margin to just 6.7%. “It felt like: oh, this electorate is changing and maybe it’s not going to put up with bullshit permanently,” Kane says. “I looked at the Zali Steggall thing and I thought, gee, you know, if you actually get a genuine community movement, if there was a candidate who came up in Kooyong, I actually think I might do something about it. Because I think the situation in our country has just got so dire, that I just don’t feel like I can just sit back and do nothing about it.” Jane Hearn volunteers for Kylea Tink’s campaign for North Sydney. She is retired, but spent much of her working life as a public servant at Parliament House in Canberra. Before the “Voices of” movement, she says, there was no candidate or party in North Sydney that she felt like supporting. “Every year I used to think ‘it just can’t get any worse’ and I think it’s really absolute rock bottom now, and it’s destructive,” she says. “It’s kind of like a low-level depression, where you feel dispirited and depressed about political culture.” She joined Voices of North Sydney and started attending discussion groups, called kitchen table conversations. “I have actually met neighbours that I just wouldn’t have met otherwise,” she says. “Yesterday three of us went in our pink Tink T-shirts to a local cafe, and one person lives in the same apartment building as me and another lives two buildings along, but we’d never met each other. I think that’s what gives it more a feeling of connection … you’re meeting people who are in your local neighbourhood.” It has mobilised people who were voting Liberal out of habit as well as Labor and Greens voters who had become resigned to never getting their party elected, Hearn says. “Whoever the Liberal party trots out and puts up gets in by default because it’s so deeply ingrained in the thinking of people in this area,” she says. “It’s a bridge too far for them to vote Labor, and in fact they may not want to vote Labor.” Kane describes the same pattern in Kooyong. “A lot of the issues of the major parties apply to Labor as well,” she says. Some in the Queensland seat of Groom do vote Labor, but only at a state election. Groom, which takes in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, is the second-safest Liberal National party seat in Queensland, with a margin of 20.5%. “We’re so safe that we couldn’t even get a car park,” says Jen Patrick, a volunteer for Suzi Holt’s campaign. Holt is campaigning to win the seat, but it’s a steep ask. A victory, in the first instance, will be to make whoever does win government pay attention to them. “When you’re in a situation where the LNP thinks it’s a hereditary fiefdom, Labor doesn’t seem to be putting its hand up, and you’ve got a smattering of minor parties, I think an independent is the way to go,” Patrick says. Holt, a social worker, is the only candidate endorsed by a “Voices of” group in Queensland so far. She has refused donations from anyone outside the electorate, including Climate 200. The advent of Holmes à Court’s group has drawn claims from some Coalition MPs that it is more than a funding vehicle for independents. “If it looks like a political party, if it acts like a political party, if it feels like a political party, I would suggest it is a political party” the Wentworth MP Dave Sharma told Sky News. That has been rejected by both Holmes à Court and the independents supported by Climate 200, including Sharma’s opponent, Allegra Spender. The most high-profile independent, Steggall, has not taken funding from Climate 200, although she publicly supports the organisation. She raised enough on her own to turn down funding in 2019, and expects to do so again this year. “In no way are we a party,” Holmes à Court told the National Press Club last month. “We don’t start campaigns, we don’t select candidates … We don’t have a policy platform. We have values, and we will only fund those who also have those values, but we don’t specify in any degree of specificity how those are to be achieved.” Rob Priestly, the independent candidate for Nicholls in northern Victoria, and Linda Seymour, the “Voices of” candidate in Craig Kelly’s southern Sydney seat of Hughes, also said they would not take money from Climate 200. Seymour told supporters she pulled out of talks with Climate 200 because she did not support their funding criteria, which require community campaigns to have raised a certain amount of money before they apply. In her campaign newsletter, she wrote: “Their determinate of a good candidate was how much money had they raised, they were not interested in my character, the validity of my community connections nor did they show interest in the Hughes community in general.” The lobby group has donated to Georgia Steele, another independent running in Hughes, and Despi O’Connor, an independent candidate in Greg Hunt’s seat of Flinders in Victoria, who is running against Dr Sarah Russell, the candidate endorsed by the Voices of Mornington Peninsula. Nineteen of the 21 candidates nominated so far by “Voices of” groups are women, as were many of the volunteers who contacted Guardian Australia. McGowan, whose 2013 win in the previously safe Liberal seat of Indi sprang from the first “Voices of” campaign, says the high number of women could be because communities want to reset the balance, or that they know women to be good organisers and leaders who may not nominate themselves. “I think in the past lots of blokes put their hand up because they think they can do it,” she says. “Whereas this has been because the community have gone looking for somebody who would represent them and they’ve gone to good women who they know are competent and able and have got integrity.” Dr Sophie Scamps, a GP and the independent candidate for Mackellar on Sydney’s northern beaches, was initially looking for someone else to run. She co-founded Voices of Mackellar and then another group, Mackellar Rising, with a view to fielding an independent candidate modelled on the success of Steggall’s campaign in neighbouring Warringah. “Very much the message [from the community consultation conducted by Voices of Mackellar] was coming across: we’re not being heard, we’re not being listened to and we’re not being represented. What we need is an independent like Zali next door,” she says. Scamps ticks a lot of boxes for an independent candidate: as a local GP she was well known and reasonably well-off, so she had the ability to put paid work on hold, and she was already heavily involved in the campaign. She stopped working as a doctor and has been campaigning full-time since November. Her campaign was able to raise enough money to hire Popularis, the campaign specialists who assisted on Steggall’s 2019 bid, and has also received $100,000 from Climate 200. Scamps says that funding was given without prejudice, and she has never had a conversation with the group about policy. “I think that the LNP is driving a particular narrative because they’re feeling threatened, and to try and paint it as a party helps their own narrative,” she says. “For Climate 200 to come in over the top and say ‘you’ve got to do this’ would go against everything we stand for.” The sitting Liberal MP, Jason Falinski, refers to Scamps’s campaign as “the Climate 200 campaign” and has accused her of misrepresenting his position on climate change. Scamps says she was motivated to start Voices of Mackellar after receiving a letter from Falinski in February 2020. It was a tick-a-box survey asking constituents to mark what issues, from a list of about 20, were of concern to them. “Climate change wasn’t on that list,” Scamps says. “We were still breathing in the smoke from the fires.” Later that month, she says, she met Falinski at a mobile electorate office event and, when she asked him to speak up on climate change as a moderate voice in the Liberal party, he replied: “The problem is, you can’t mention the words climate change in the party room because the Queensland MPs jump up and down.” Falinski denies Scamps’s characterisation of both events. He says while the survey did not list climate change, it did list environmental issues, and that he had no memory of meeting Scamps at that event, and had “never thought, much less said” what she claimed he said. “As the last five years of my time in parliament have demonstrated, I have had no problem arguing for climate change action and policy including net zero and upgrading our 2030 targets.” Falinski says. “Unlike some, I did not suddenly discover global warming when I decided I wanted to be a member of parliament.” If Falinski has done his job as a local member as well as he says he has, he will not need to worry. According to the ABC’s Antony Green, for a safe seat to turn independent requires organisation, money, a well-known name, and a general sense from the electorate that they have been neglected. That makes the national trend impossible to detect: it will be determined seat by seat. People might vote for parties out of habit, but an independent must secure personal support. “For every Zali Steggall or Cathy McGowan there’s another independent who didn’t get up,” Green says. The independent campaigns in the New South Wales seats of North Sydney and Wentworth, Victoria’s Kooyong and Goldstein, and Curtin in Western Australia, all have money, a name that is well-known locally and organisation, Green says. But there is one more element they need to have a realistic shot at winning the seat. “The thing that works in favour of independents is if there is a perception that the sitting member is not good enough,” he says. It will be up to sitting members to convince the electorate that the final piece of the puzzle is missing, and they need to focus on their record rather than being distracted by the challenger. McGowan, for her part, plans to spend the next three months on the road, helping independent campaigns wherever she can. “I am absolutely committed to seeing more independents in parliament,” she says. “I’m basically accepting any and every invitation I can get to campaign.” She offers a final piece of advice. “If they are looking for the answer in me, I am probably not the answer,” she says. “The answer will lie in their community. “You need to get your communities organised, get your volunteer base organised, and set up mechanisms where you respond to your local community … the campaign is the process of setting up a foundation for being an effective member of parliament.”",News/Australia news,‘The LNP are feeling threatened’: the growing ambition of independents challenging Coalition MPs,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/13/the-lnp-are-feeling-threatened-the-growing-ambition-of-independents-challenging-coalition-mps
3/13/2022,"Aaron Falle was five when he landed in Australia from New Zealand. He was in his 40s when the federal government sent him back – away from his daughter, his son’s grave and the country he grew up in. His mother had taken him with her when she moved across the ditch to marry an Australian man, who went on to adopt Falle. Citizenship papers should have arrived along with the adoption certificates, Falle says, but he never checked. He always thought of himself as Australian. It wasn’t until he was in jail on drug trafficking charges – “weed, low-grade speed, ecstasy” – that the question of citizenship came up. It was then he was told he would be deported under section 501 of the Migration Act. “I had a job to go to, my house, my family. I got parole the first time I applied. I was looking forward to getting out,” he says. “They picked me up from jail, put me in a detention centre, then put me on a plane.” Falle is just one of thousands of non-citizens deported from Australia using the “character test” legislation. Many are sent “back” to countries they barely lived in, where they have no support, where they might not even speak the language. The government boasts it has deported 10,000 people since the laws were broadened in 2014, and in 2019 proposed a bill to further “strengthen” the character test, creating a new category of “designated offences” that could drastically increase the number of people deemed to have failed the test – by a factor of five, according to one estimate. Last month the government relisted the bill, calling it a “test for Labor” on national security. The bill passed the House of Representatives with Labor’s support, but its fate in the Senate is unknown, with just two sitting days left before the anticipated May election. If a non-citizen committed any of the offences designated under the bill they would be deemed to have automatically failed the character test, meaning their visa could be cancelled, although discretion would remain with the immigration minister. The offences include violence against a person, weapons offences, breaching of an apprehended violence order and non-consensual sexual acts punishable by at least two years in prison. New Zealanders are the most common cohort deported under section 501 – and Australia’s neighbour is not happy about it. NZ’s foreign affairs minister, Nanaia Mahuta, says her government has raised the issue with Australia “a number of times”. “We don’t agree with the policy and would be concerned at any moves to strengthen it,” she says. “NZ accepts that Australia has the right to deport people. However, we are concerned that Australia continues to send people to NZ who have never lived here and have no family or support networks at all.” Filipa Payne advocates for New Zealanders’ rights in Australia. She says the two countries have been interwoven over generations, but deportations are creating a rift. Those who have grown up in Australia are utterly overwhelmed when they land in NZ, she says. “Their bodies might be here … but their minds are still concerned with their children, their wives, their parents, their friends. Everything is based in Australia.” As more people are deported and the federal government tries to broaden the scope under which they can be deported, Payne believes NZ will be the “epicentre” for change. “We’ll end up having boycotts, sports teams not willing to play [in Australia], a disconnnect in the Pacific because of the abuse Australia continues to inflict,” she says. In 2020-21, 946 visas were cancelled under section 501. Drug offences were the most common reason with 197 cancellations, followed by 108 for assault and 102 for child sexual abuse offences. Other cancellations were for driving offences (28), non-violent offences (8) and theft (61). There has been a large increase since 2013-14, when 76 visas were cancelled. At the end of 2014 the legislation was changed to make cancellation mandatory in some cases. In 2014-15, the number of cancellations rose to 579; in 2015-16 there were 986; and in 2016-17 there were 1,278. New Zealand is easily the most common nationality represented, with 402 cancellations in 2020-21. The UK is next, with 101. In the same year, 717 of the 946 sought to have their cancellation revoked – 265 were successful. Another deportee, Daniel, was deported almost 30 years after moving to Australia at the age of nine. He easily concedes that he did the wrong thing: joining a gang, and later assaulting someone who planned to assault him. But he turned his life around, he says, after he had a son – a son who is still in Australia. “I got off all drugs, alcohol, even coffee. I got off medication, I went to church, I got baptised,” he says. “As soon as he [my son] came along, that’s what made me feel like a person.” When Daniel got parole, he was told he was going home. “As I got to the gate, they said: ‘Nah, you’re going to the detention centre’.” “I saw my son crying as I was taken away,” he says. Like others, he hardly knows anyone in NZ, and he struggled with administration – his Australian bank accounts were closed, although he was paying the mortgage in Australia so his ex and his son could stay there. “For 99 years, I can’t come back. It’s a kick in the guts,” he says. “I did my time. I realised I’d done wrong. I repented. It made me sick what I’d done. “The money isn’t the best, I’m trying to send money over, sending everything there,” Daniel says. “They’ve kicked me out. They don’t have to punish my family, too.” Patrick Keyzer, a human rights lawyer, says while some deportees have committed serious offences, a “very significant proportion … had not been convicted of serious crimes”. Many would be described as minor offences, he says. “Drug offences, theft, burglary, low-level property offences … and there are cases where people have been given suspended sentences,” he says. “[With a suspended sentence] they’ve made a risk assessment that you should be able to re-enter the community. So if a judge has made that assessment, and formed a view that a person is not a risk to Australian society, how can it be that the minister for immigration would form a view that the person would nevertheless pose a risk to Australia?” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Keyzer, the dean of law in the Australian Catholic University’s Thomas More law school, questions the expertise of the people advising the minister and the arbitrariness of the decisions. That’s “deeply troubling”, he says, considering the impact on family life. “The deportation of a lot of these people breaks up families, removes breadwinners from the home, and often places the families – typically a mother and children – in serious economic distress.” He says since 2014 there have been amendments to the legislation that make it “harder and harder to appeal, and easier and easier to deport”. “A number of the people who we interviewed [for a 2016 article] talked about the Anzacs, and said we’ve served with Australians in the trenches in world wars, and we can’t understand how you could treat us like this.” Visas can be cancelled under section 501 if “the minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test” or under section 116, which contains a host of reasons for cancellation, including if the person “is or may be, or would or might be” a risk to individuals or the community. The “god-like” powers of section 116 were used to deport tennis player Novak Djokovic after he arrived to play in the Australian Open in January, despite failing to declare his vaccination status. “Under s116 you can reapply [for an Australian visa] after three years,” Payne says. “[But] I don’t know anyone who’s been successful in that application, because they then cancel them under 501. It’s morally bankrupt, and it’s completely destroying families.” Last year Payne announced a class action against the federal government. She has a team of Australian lawyers, and so far 327 people from 52 different nationalities have registered. Mark Glazbrook, a migration agent, says many people coming to Australia are never told they need to become a citizen to avoid the possibility of being deported, even if they have been here for 20 or 30 years. “A situation we’ve come across quite frequently is where someone may have committed an offence, they’ve gone through the courts, they serve their time, they’re released, and then they can be kicked out of the country,” he says. “Someone in Australia who commits the same crime goes through the same process, they rehabilitate, and they’re OK – they’ve done their time.” Glazbrook, the chief executive officer of Adelaide-based Migration Solutions, says people – especially those who have been living here, and who have families here – deserve a second chance. “It’s quite odd someone can live here their entire life, then be kicked out of the country just because they never applied for citizenship,” he says. An Australian Border Force spokesperson said the ABF “plays a critical role in protecting Australia and this includes removing individuals who pose a risk to the community or who are in Australia without a valid visa”. Those who are unwilling to depart “voluntarily” can be detained and removed, the spokesperson said. “Individuals removed by the ABF include serious criminal offenders, individuals who have deliberately overstayed their visas or breached their visa conditions, or individuals who have been found not to have met Australia’s protection obligations. “A non-citizen’s visa must be cancelled if they are serving, or have served a full-time term of imprisonment for an offence committed in Australia and they have, at any time, been sentenced to a period of 12 months or more imprisonment.” “Removals” are carried out respectfully and the ABF “provides post removal support to individuals assessed on their personal circumstances”, the spokesperson said. Falle says he had no criminal history until he lost his job after an accident and turned to drug dealing for six months. “I’d say I can pass any character test,” he says. “I can still get into Europe, Asia, but not home to Australia. I’ve only got a speeding ticket in NZ in the five years I’ve been here.” Somewhere in the flurry of deportation, Falle was told he could come back to Australia after a year. So, after a year and a few days, he flew into Queensland. But the authorities put him straight back into detention, saying he had signed a revocation letter – and showing him a form that he says he had never seen before. “They handcuffed me, put me on a plane, they dumped me back on the streets of NZ,” he says. “And then they wanted me to pay for the ticket.”",News/Australia news,Deported to a land they barely know: anger rises over Australia’s ‘character test’ for non-citizens,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/13/deported-to-a-land-they-barely-know-anger-rises-over-australias-character-test-for-non-citizens
3/13/2022,"The giant kelp forests that flourished along the Tasmanian east coast had all-but vanished before most people realised they were gone. Scott Ling watched them go. He learned to dive in them at Fortescue Bay, on the Tasman peninsula in the state’s south-east, in 1998. A little more than a decade later they had largely disappeared, victims of a spike in coastal ocean temperatures well above the global average. It brought marine heatwaves and the southward migration of the long-spined sea urchin, a rapacious species that used to be limited to the warmer waters off New South Wales. The climate-driven loss of more than 95% of the state’s giant kelp was listed in a major recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as an example of cascading impacts across natural systems and society. The Tasmanian global heating hotspot cost not only the kelp forests but the aquatic ecosystem and fishing and diving industries that relied on them. Like many, Ling remembers times when the kelp at Bicheno, farther north up the state’s coast, was “so thick that fishermen would just tie off on the giant kelp, rather than anchor”. “Now there is just the odd tree,” he says. “The kelp is functionally extinct across most of the east coast.” Ling, an associate professor at the University of Tasmania’s Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies (Imas), is part of a small group taking steps to see if that can be addressed. Over the past 18 months, he has joined his Imas colleague Dr Scott Bennett and the dive tourism operator Mick Baron in trials seeding giant kelp propagules on a rocky Tasman peninsula reef. On a recent trip with Guardian Australia, they showed off their initial success, the kelp having grown up to 3 metres within six months. Having proved the concept – that giant kelp can be seeded on twine wrapped around reef boulders, and then can attach itself to the reef proper – they are now aiming bigger. Backed by an initial $300,000 in philanthropic support from the newly created Sea Forest Foundation, a project of climate entrepreneur Sam Elsom, they hope to seed a full half-hectare of lush kelp forest. Because the kelp grows so rapidly – up to 10 metres in a year – a successful project could lead to a full canopy across an area 100 metres by 50 metres by next summer. Everyone involved acknowledges the project will face challenges, but is ambitious for where it might lead. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The goal is to try to save the giant kelp forests in Tasmania,” Bennett says. “We’re at a point if we do nothing they will be lost.” “Hopefully, it is more than just an underwater museum where we can show people what a giant kelp forest used to be like,” Ling says. “Hopefully, we can reverse-industrialise Tasmania’s east coast.” From the outside, the biggest question facing the enterprise is: what is to stop the newly seeded kelp going the same way as the historic forests? Long-spined sea urchins remain rampant along the coast. The population is estimated to have tripled since 2016 and has turned many areas into what is known as “urchin barren”. Baron, a trained biologist who runs the Eaglehawk Dive Centre, expressed his distress over the loss of the kelp forests two years ago in Guardian Australia’s Frontline series, saying parts of the ocean had been turned into “an asphalt driveway”. The scientists will attempt to address this by selecting a kelp forest regrowth site with fewer-than-average urchin and leaning on students and diving enthusiasts to help protect the site by helping collect the predators. They hope the state government will kick in further support, including policies to support reef restoration. Marine heatwaves also remain a clear threat, and Elsom’s support will be key to tackling it. His company, Sea Forest, aims to commercially cultivate Asparagopsis, a seaweed that could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cattle if mixed with their feed. Last year Sea Forest gave the scientists 250,000 propagules and is backing work at Imas on temperature-tolerant strains that may ultimately increase the chance of survival. Elsom says Sea Forest and Imas have developed a “great symbiotic relationship”, and that all involved had been buoyed by the “amazing results” of the initial trials. “By utilising temperature-tolerant propagules, our aim is to improve the future,” he says. “We believe that these ecosystems can then begin to become self-sufficient.” Of the lost kelp forests, Elsom says they have struggled for public attention due to where they are found. “The thing is we don’t see them. I feel like if this was a bushfire, and a forest wiped out, everyone would be up in arms,” he says. Both Bennett and Ling see the disappearing kelp forests as part of a bigger idea that has started to gain some traction: the great southern reef. They are backed by the Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson who has been diving with the Scotts to see their trial and last year made a film about the loss of the kelp forests. Stretching from Kalbarri on the Western Australian mid-coast to Brisbane, arching around Tasmania, the great southern reef is described as a series of interconnected temperate rocky reefs and seagrass meadows. Bennett says the marine environment along the south of the continent “has never been appreciated for what it really is”. “It rivals the Great Barrier Reef on pretty much any metric you look at,” he says. Whish-Wilson says the southern reef network contributes more than $10bn to Australia’s economy each year, and 70% of Australians live within 50km of it, but receives a fraction of the attention and funding it needs to withstand pressure from global heating, invasive species and industry. On Friday, he released the country’s first great southern reef policy, calling for a $20m giant kelp recovery plan, $40m for an invasive marine species unit within CSIRO to better deal with invasive urchins, and the appointment of a great southern reef envoy to perform a similar role to that played for the Great Barrier Reef by Coalition MP Warren Entsch. The Greens want golden kelp, which dominates mainland reefs and is also a victim of heatwaves and urchins, to be listed as a threatened ecological community, and giant kelp to finally receive a full recovery plan a decade after it was listed as in trouble. “The Great Barrier Reef understandably gets billions of federal funding, but it’s great southern sister literally gets a few million dollars to deal with equally serious challenges,” Whish-Wilson says. “No matter what the outcome at the upcoming election, we are ready to work with the next federal government to take a holistic and integrated approach to promoting, funding and managing it.” Ling believes the project to try to restore the giant kelp forests of Tasmania could prove a call to arms. “I think people are over eco-grief and want to get in there and make a difference. The great thing about giant kelp is they can do that very quickly. We have a chance to rebuild an ecosystem and ultimately make this self-sustaining,” he says. “We need to be thinking globally and be reducing emissions but there are a whole lot of things we can be doing by acting locally. We’re not going to just sit on our hands and let this go. I really think this is worth a crack.”",News/Australia news,‘Really worth a crack’: bringing Tasmania’s giant kelp forests back from the brink,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/13/really-worth-a-crack-bringing-tasmanias-giant-kelp-forests-back-from-the-brink
3/13/2022,"Russia has said it will treat arms shipments to Ukraine from Nato countries as “legitimate targets” for military action in a dangerous new escalation of tensions. The warning from the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, came as supporters of Ukraine, including the UK, Germany and the United States, have been urgently shipping thousands of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Kyiv in response to Moscow’s aggression. Ryabkov said that Russia had “warned the US that pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn’t just a dangerous move, it’s an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, disclosed that at least 1,300 of his country’s troops have been killed in the conflict so far in the first estimate of Ukraine’s combat losses after almost three weeks of fighting. Ukraine has claimed to have killed some 12,000 Russian troops. Heavy fighting continued across Ukraine. The French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz reported that Vladimir Putin showed no willingness to end the war after a phone call between the leaders in which they renewed a call for a ceasefire and negotiations. A statement from the office of the French president described the conversation with the Russian leader as “very frank and also difficult”. Russian forces continued to pulverise the besieged port city of Mariupol, shelling a mosque sheltering more than 80 people, including children, the Ukrainian government said on Saturday, while fighting also raged on the outskirts of Kyiv. In several areas around the capital artillery barrages sent residents scurrying for shelter and air raid sirens wailed. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said that Russian ground forces massed north of Kyiv had now edged to within 15 miles of the city centre as their attempt to encircle it ground on. Columns of smoke were seen rising over the southwest of the city after a strike on an ammunition depot in the town of Vasylkiv. In the south, Ukraine’s military said that Russian forces captured Mariupol’s eastern outskirts, tightening the armed squeeze on the strategic port. Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. Zelenskiy encouraged his people to keep up their resistance, which many analysts said has prevented the rapid offensive and military victory the Kremlin had expected. “The fact that the whole Ukrainian people resist these invaders has already gone down in history, but we do not have the right to let up our defence, no matter how difficult it may be for us,” he said. He accused Russia of employing “a new stage of terror” with the apparent kidnapping of the mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, who was last seen being led away from his office on Friday by armed men, prompting a demonstration in the city. Zelenskiy added that Russia would need to carpet-bomb the Ukrainian capital and kill its residents to take the city. “They will come here only if they kill us all,” he said. “If that is their goal, let them come.” In a bleak coda that spoke of the continuing levels of destruction, Zelenskiy added that some small Ukrainian towns had ceased to exist. Despite crippling economic sanctions imposed on Moscow and international isolation, Putin – who has imposed his own draconian crackdown on media freedom and free speech in Russia – has given no indication of being swayed to end the war. In his 90-minute call with Macron and Scholz on Saturday, Putin spoke about “issues related to agreements under discussion to implement the Russian demands” for ending the war, the Kremlin said without providing details. Among other things, the Kremlin has previously demanded a promise by Nato never to accept Ukraine as a member and for the alliance to pull back from countries such as Poland, Romania and Bulgaria. Ukrainian officials continued efforts to evacuate besieged cities, including the capital, as well as towns and villages in the regions of Kyiv, Sumy and some other areas. The governor of the Kyiv region Oleksiy Kuleba said fighting and threats of Russian air attacks were continuing yesterday morning but later said some evacuations were proceeding. “We will try to get people out every day, as long as it’s possible to observe a ceasefire,” he said. The governor of the Russian-controlled territory of Donetsk said constant shelling was complicating bringing aid into Mariupol. “There are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city,” the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. “Medicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and the food and water are in short supply.” People were boiling ground water for drinking, using wood to cook food and burying dead bodies near where they lay, a staff member for the international group Médecins Sans Frontières in the city said. “We saw people who died because of lack of medication,” he said, adding that many people had also been wounded or killed. “Neighbours just dig a hole in the ground and put the dead bodies inside.”",News/World news,"Arms shipments are a legitimate military target, Kremlin warns west",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/arms-shipments-are-a-legitimate-military-target-kremlin-warns-west
3/13/2022,"In the snow-dusted woods outside Kyiv a column of Ukrainian troops moves, identifiable by the soldiers’ yellow armbands. In the rare footage, captured by Maryan Kushnir, a journalist with the Ukrainian service of Radio Free Europe, one of the soldiers says they are going to clear an unidentified village of “orcs”– slang for the Russian troops now rapidly encircling the Ukrainian capital – who have occupied it with armoured vehicles. A commander warns that two tanks are coming, and as the men appear to fall back to a better position, there is an exchange of heavy fire. The video’s ending is as sudden as it is inconclusive. Other videos to have emerged in recent days show similar scenes. Soldiers in urban settings crunch through debris, or traverse the darkened countryside for a planned ambush that is viewed through night-vision goggles, their friendly-force beacons flashing ghostly green on their helmets. The images are of a piece with many others circulating on social media and elsewhere, and important for what they depict. They show Ukrainian troops in combat, usually on foot, exploiting tangled woods or streets to set their ambushes, armed inevitably with anti-tank weapons, including British-supplied NLAWS and German Panzerfausts. And with Russian forces significantly tightening their siege of key Ukrainian cities in recent days, including concentrating about 21-22 battalion tactical groups around the capital Kyiv, it is footage that demonstrates how the conflict has rapidly become a tale of two very different ways of waging warfare. On the Ukrainian side – in tactics reminiscent of the Finnish resistance during the Winter War of 1939, when the Soviet forces were fought to a standstill by largely outnumbered Finnish troops – Kyiv’s successes have relied on highly mobile hit-and-run attacks on the slow-moving and congested Russian military columns. And as more anti-tank weapons have poured in from the west for Ukraine’s defence, Russia’s tactics have switched to a slow and brutal kind of siege warfare in response, designed to encircle and break Ukraine’s cities and to force Ukraine’s military into a more static defensive positions where they can more easily be overwhelmed. In a warning of what Russia’s new military tactics might mean for Ukraine’s defenders, Andrzej Wilk and Piotr Żochowski of the Warsaw-based thinktank, the Centre for Eastern Studies, noted the emerging challenge to Ukraine’s defenders in their most recent daily update on the war. “In most directions, Russian offensive operations have turned into positional combat, in which the aggressor attempts to encircle Ukrainian forces in the main urban centres and displace them from the smaller towns. “[The Russians] will strive to fully close the encirclements of towns and cities where this has not yet happened, and to push the Ukrainian troops all the way into the built-up areas, regardless of how many losses they [Russians] suffer.” Whether that succeeds – and how Ukrainian forces adapt – may well be defining. One already grimly familiar model of what the coming phase of the war predicted by Wilk and Żochowski will look like has already been provided by the almost two-week-long Russian siege of the southern port city of Mariupol where at least 1,500 people have died in a constant bombardment that has trapped defenders and civilians in basements. On Saturday, as Ukrainian officials reported that Russia had shelled a mosque where 80 people were sheltering, the UN humanitarian office offered its latest update on the status of the city. “There are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city,” the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. “Medicines for life-threatening illnesses are running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and food and water are in short supply.” As the UK’s Ministry of Defence warned on Friday that Russian forces could target Kyiv in a few days, evidence of the feared coming storm saw artillery pound the city’s northwestern outskirts on Saturday. as two columns of smoke – one black and one white – rose in the town of Vaslkyiv after a strike on an ammunition depot. New commercial satellite images also appeared to capture artillery firing on residential areas that stood between the Russians and the capital. The images from Maxar Technologies showed muzzle flashes and smoke from big guns, as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, 20 miles from Kyiv, the company said. The inequalities of the fight have also been underlined in different ways with American defence officials saying Russian pilots – despite well-documented losses – are averaging 200 sorties a day, compared with five to 10 for Ukrainian forces. And there is growing evidence that the scope of the war is widening. Until recently, Russia’s troops had made their biggest advances on cities in the east and south, while struggling in the north and around Kyiv. Last week, however, Russian forces also started targeting areas in western Ukraine, where large numbers of refugees have fled, with Russia saying on Friday it used high-precision long-range weapons to put military airfields in the western cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk “out of action.” Russian airstrikes also targeted Dnipro, a major industrial hub in the east and Ukraine’s fourth-largest city, with about one million inhabitants. One person was killed, Ukrainian officials said. Facing the challenges of the new Russian reliance on siege warfare, some analysts believe Ukraine’s defenders will have to adapt again to confront the new threat that poses, amid grim warnings that an already terrible conflict could yet turn darker. “It’s ugly already, but it’s going to get worse,” said Nick Reynolds, a warfare analyst at Royal United Services Institute.",News/World news,Shaky footage in Ukraine shows this is a tale of two ways of waging war: stealth versus brute force ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/shaky-footage-in-ukraine-shows-this-is-a-tale-of-two-ways-of-waging-war-stealth-versus-brute-force
