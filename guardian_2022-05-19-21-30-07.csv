5/19/2022,"EasyJet said it was heading for summer with “strong momentum and optimism”, flying at near pre-pandemic capacity in peak season as the lifting of Covid restrictions helped the airline narrow its half-year losses and look to a return to profit. Chief executive Johan Lundgren said easyJet was benefiting from “pent-up demand and removal of travel restrictions” as well as a strategic decision to run more of its flights on popular routes. EasyJet said that since the Easter holiday in mid-April, it had been operating 1,600 flights and carrying up to 250,000 customers a day. The airline added that it was facing the summer travel season “with optimism”, by when Lundgren said capacity would be at 97% of pre-pandemic levels. “As we return to a more normal summer season, we are ready to capture the increased levels of demand right across our network,” he said. “We are confident in our plans for summer which will see us reaching near 2019 flying levels and look forward to competing with our renewed strengths as a winner in the post pandemic recovery of European aviation.” He said the airline would have to “wait and see” how economic worries would affect winter bookings, but added: “The unemployment numbers are really important for us – when people have the certainty of an income that is good for this industry.” While fuel and cost of living rises would be an issue, he added: “People who have the opportunity to prioritise, over the cost of surviving, tend to choose holidays over expensive items. EasyJet has done well in recession because people trade on value, given our competition face to face is against legacy carriers.” The budget airline narrowed its losses to £557m in the six months to March, compared with £645m in the same period a year earlier. While it has not officially guided on full year results, Lundgren said he was “not unhappy with the consensus out there that we’d be making a small profit”. He acknowledged the travel chaos at UK and European airports in recent weeks, but said the company “had taken action” to address problems by recruiting more workers and improving ID processing before flights. Thousands of passengers at some UK airports have been forced to queue outside terminals in recent weeks and some have missed flights due to staff shortages. The chaos is partly the result of layoffs during the pandemic, which were part of travel company’s efforts to rein in costs after Covid restrictions brought the industry to a standstill. Lundgren said: “It has been well documented that the industry is experiencing some operational issues so, as you would expect, we have been absolutely focused on taking action to ensure we have strengthened our operational resilience for this summer so we can deliver a great, reliable operation to our customers.” He said that as well as taking seats off the A319 aircraft to release more cabin crew for other flights, the company had added staff to work on the security and ID process for new hires. “We’ve got enough crew now – it’s just getting them through the process. It is a tight labour market – and we can’t be complacent because sectors are fighting for people.” EasyJet also acknowledged that staff were struggling amid the cost of living crisis, after inflation hit 9% in April, but said it was working with trade unions to support crew while maintaining control of its cost base. HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg said: “What we can see, looks decent. Winter remains the unknown. Concerns over weakening consumer confidence in the autumn abound. We think there is a possibility that these fears may be overdone. We expect consolidation, aircraft and labour shortages combined to limit capacity and support yields in a challenging economic environment.”",News/Business,EasyJet forecasts return to near pre-Covid flying levels in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/easyjet-forecasts-return-to-near-pre-covid-flying-levels-in-2022
5/19/2022,"Turning Points is the London Sinfonietta’s occasional series at Kings Place, focusing on some the 20th century’s most important composers and their key works, and designed to bring newcomers to modern music. Certainly the audience for the latest concert, which was introduced by Sara Mohr-Pietsch, contained few of the familiar faces seen at the Sinfonietta’s Southbank Centre dates. But then the programme that Gerry Cornelius conducted, containing short pieces by four of the indisputably great figures of the last 100 years, was much more like the kind of concert that was once the orchestra’s bread and butter, and which it plays all too rarely nowadays. Mohr-Pietsch’s thought-provoking introduction talked of “listening rituals”, likening the modern concert hall to the sacred spaces of prehistoric cultures, though whether drawing such parallels helps to break down barriers between new audiences and new music is debatable. But the choice of works provided a showcase for the range of contemporary styles. Edgard Varèse’s solo-flute Density 21.5, played with incantatory power by Michael Cox, provided the stark modernist starting point. The flurries, trills and moments of sudden stillness of Pierre Boulez’s Dérive I, which the Sinfonietta premiered in 1985, followed, contrasting with the isolated string phrases and glacial piano chords of the third of Morton Feldman’s Viola in My Life pieces from Paul Silverthorne and Elizabeth Burley. O King, Luciano Berio’s memorial to Martin Luther King, was played in its chamber form, with the voice of the mezzo-soprano Simone Ibbett-Brown embedded in the textures of just five instruments, and a much sparer, rawer tribute than the orchestral version of the work that Berio would include in his acclaimed Sinfonia. To end, there was something more recent – Tansy Davies’s Grind Show (unplugged), a reminder that the musical worlds of funk and Harrison Birtwistle aren’t as far apart as you might imagine. What newcomers would have made of this introduction is hard to say, but it was a neatly packaged and presented collection of gems.",Arts/Music,London Sinfonietta/Cornelius review – neatly packaged collection of modern gems,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/19/london-sinfonietta-cornelius-review-kings-place-london-turning-points
5/19/2022,"The widow of a British-based photographer who was murdered by Col Gaddafi’s forces in Libya in 2011 has accused South Africa of withholding crucial information about her husband’s death that could help in efforts to locate his body. Anton Hammerl was killed in an incident in May 2011 that saw other journalists, including James Foley – who was later kidnapped and beheaded by Islamic State in Syria – taken prisoner. Penny Sukhraj-Hammerl found out on 19 May 2011 her husband was dead after 44 days of being led to believe that he was still alive in captivity along with other journalists. The body of Hammerl – who was shot and left for dead in the desert – has never been found despite a years-long campaign by his widow. At issue is the circumstances of the return of Hammerl’s passport to his widow by South Africa in 2016 with Sukhraj-Hammerl believing the circumstances of how his passport came to be in South Africa may help the family find his body. “It was posted to my office in mid-2016. I was quite overwhelmed as I didn’t expect it,” she said, explaining that her husband would have been carrying his ID document at the time of his death in a photographer’s waist pouch he wore. Despite the unexplained delivery of the passport, the family’s subsequent efforts to find out how the passport came to be handed over to the South African government, including a freedom of information request, have been stonewalled repeatedly, prompting the family to go public about the passport. In a letter sent this week to the South African high commissioner, Nomatemba Tambo, in London and copied to the country’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, the family’s anger is palpable. “It’s been nearly a year since I first wrote to you and your government to request a meeting regarding the case of my late husband … who was murdered by Gaddafi forces in Libya in April 2011. “During this time, we have signalled publicly and privately on several occasions that we would like to meet urgently to discuss a matter of serious concern in the handling of our case. More than a decade since Anton’s death, we still don’t know the location of his remains. “We still don’t have a grave to visit. We still don’t know the truth. Your administration’s response? Silence.” Sukhraj-Hammerl told the Guardian: “I’m baffled by their response. They’ve demonstrated no regard for accountability. We’ve requested meetings that have not been granted. “I feel that they had information that they should have shared with us. So many officials involved that I find it hard to believe that someone doesn’t know something as significant as how a passport came to be handed over.” Sukhraj-Hammerl, 46, will also be speaking at a public event at the Frontline Club in London on Thursday evening, the 11th anniversary of the discovery of his death, where she will be joined by James Foley’s mother, Diane, and Matthew Caruana Galizia, one of the sons of assassinated Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. The issue with the passport has been part of a series of rebuffs for the family since Anton disappeared in 2011. Led to believe that then South African president Jacob Zuma (who has denied accusations of receiving $30m from Gaddafi) visited Tripoli in the last days of Gaddafi’s rule, the family were led to believe Zuma would raise the issue only to discover it was not discussed. “I think we’re calling for justice and truth. We’ve not had the due – as family we should have had. It’s been really distressing. It’s horrid (to) realise [the South African government] had an opportunity to do more and choose deliberately (to) ignore us. “We have a right to know. They owe us an explanation. It is least that they can do.” The South African high commission in London has been approached for comment.",News/World news,Widow of man killed in Libya accuses South Africa of ‘silence’ in hunt for his body,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/nton-hammerl-widow-south-africa-silence-libya-passport

5/19/2022,"It was a stunning, grisly act. A man, a climate activist and Buddhist, had set himself on fire on the steps of the US supreme court. He sat upright and didn’t immediately scream despite the agony. Police officers desperately plunged nearby orange traffic cones into the court’s marbled fountain and hurled water at him. It wasn’t enough to save him. The death of Wynn Bruce, a 50-year-old photographer who lived in Boulder, Colorado, was a shock to those who knew him. “It was so upsetting,” said April Lyons, a psychotherapist who knew Bruce from a therapeutic dance class they both took. “He was a solid person, a compassionate, kind person. We had no idea he’d do this.” Bruce’s father, Douglas, said he was sure the self-immolation – on 22 April, which is Earth Day – was “a fearless act of compassion about his concern for the environment”. There is no explicit evidence of this, although Bruce had posted a fire emoji to Facebook along with the Earth Day date of his upcoming suicide. To some, though, the terrible act was an indication of the curdling anguish that many people now harbor over the escalating climate crisis. Bruce’s death felt hauntingly familiar. Four years ago nearly to the exact date, David Buckel, a civil rights lawyer, walked to New York City’s Prospect Park early one morning, doused himself with gasoline and set himself alight. Unlike Bruce, Buckel, who was 60, left a two-page note emailed to media outlets minutes before his death stating that “my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.” Bruce’s death “did make me think of what David did and also the incredible pain this sort of act causes the people who love them”, said Terry Kaelber, who was Buckel’s husband. The duo were vegetarians and dutifully did their recycling. Buckel, a keen composter, had become somewhat agitated about environmental depredation. “You can never expect this, though,” said Kaelber. “My heart pours out to Wynn’s family.” The deaths also provoked a sense of frustration that such horrific acts are not only contemplated, but then have an ephemeral impact when they do occur. Kaelber said that after the flowers of condolence were cleared from near the scorched grass of Prospect Park, some climate activists took to wearing red ribbons to remind others of Buckel’s sacrifice. But that, too, soon faded. “We have no leaders on this issue, none, no one,” Kaelber said. “So I get the despair people have but the answer isn’t to do what they did. They could’ve had more impact joining with people who are driving for change. Imagine if Wynn had chained himself and 100 Buddhists to the gates of the supreme court instead. “They think doing this will galvanize people, and maybe it will a few people, but my first thought with Wynn was that no one on the supreme court will care. It will just be this passing thing in the media. It’s tragic.” Few people worried about the climate crisis are driven to self-harm over it, of course, let alone set themselves aflame in an echo of Thich Quang Duc, the Vietnamese monk who self-immolated in protest against the persecution of Buddhists in 1963. Instead, climate activists have marched in huge numbers, joined divestment campaigns, glued themselves to roads and chained themselves to oil drilling equipment. “It’s just so clear to me that I have to take this stand,” said Peter Kalmus, a Nasa climate scientist as he handcuffed himself to a JPMorgan Chase building during a protest in Los Angeles last month. “We are heading towards fucking catastrophe – we are going to lose everything.” Yet most of us who fret about climate change do so discreetly. Studies have shown that while alarm over worsening wildfires, droughts, flooding and societal unrest is on the rise, not many of us talk about climate angst with others, to avoid political arguments or simply avoid bringing down the mood. Those who do speak out are often younger activists – research has shown that half of people between 16 and 25 years old believe the Earth may be doomed, while three-quarters feel anxiety when they think or hear about climate change. Some speak openly of not wanting to bring children into a hotter, harsher world. “Living in climate truth is like living in a nightmare. It’s absolutely horrible and I can understand why the vast majority of Americans don’t do it,” said Margaret Klein Salamon, a clinical psychologist turned climate activist. “But the worst part is that everyone’s acting normal – it’s like we are zombies. The sense of helplessness and hopelessness is holding back conversations and political action.” Salamon leads an organization, called the Climate Awakening, that facilitates “climate emotions conversations” both in-person and virtually that encourage people to open up about their climate fears. Salamon said that many describe living in a sort of waking, powerless nightmare where an obvious catastrophe is unfolding but society just blithely ignores it. “Some people have described it as like they are at a funeral but everyone else is treating it like a party,” said Salamon. “People are still going to college, planning for retirement, doing all the things as if the future will look just like the past when we know that’s not true. There’s a delusion of normalcy.” There are regular attempts to jolt us free from political inertia, whether that’s the increasingly exasperated excoriations of the Swedish school striker turned movement leader Greta Thunberg, the soaring success of the Netflix film Don’t Look Up, which satirized the blase attitude of politicians and the media toward scientific warnings, or the increasingly frantic pronouncements of António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, who has said continuing use of fossil fuels is “madness” and the work of “dangerous radicals”. This desire to shake people from a pall of complacency may have also motivated Bruce and Buckel, although Susan Clayton, a professor of psychology and environmental studies at the College of Wooster, cautions it’s risky to assume the full motivations behind a suicide. As social creatures who feed off each other’s cues, however, we are all affected by what Clayton calls “collective ignorance”. “If there’s a fire and we look around us and see no one is doing anything, you can feel you are also expected to do nothing, not realizing that other people are looking to you for the same reason,” she said. “There’s this sense that people around us are not only doing nothing about this problem, but not even acting like it’s important.” For all the efforts of various activists, and promises by governments to restrain dangerous global heating, carbon emissions leapt globally last year as we reverted back to the polluting status quo before Covid lockdowns. Wildfires are now a year-round menace to the US west. On Friday, it hit 51C in Pakistan, while India has baked in such extreme, record heat that dozens of people have died and birds are falling from the sky. The UN has warned that a broken perception of risk based on “optimism, underestimation and invincibility” is fueling such disasters. Oil and gas companies are planning, unhindered, a massive tranche of “carbon bomb” drilling projects that will propel us firmly towards climate catastrophe. There is much to be anxious of, but some climate scientists argue we cannot let a wave of “doomerism” become paralyzing. There is still hope that concerted action will avoid the worst, that momentum is building for a cleaner, greener world. Activism is a good release valve for climate worries, Clayton said, not only to help confront the problem but as a forum to speak to others with similar concerns. “Climate doomism can be harmful, because it robs us of agency, the agency we still have in determining our future,” said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University. “I fear that doomism and defeatism leads us down the path of inaction, or worse. “It would be much better for folks to channel those emotions toward the common goal of speaking truth to power and holding our policymakers accountable for addressing the mounting climate crisis.” To little public fanfare, two memorials were held for Wynn Bruce last week, one in Boulder and one in Minnesota, where his father still lives. Attendees spoke of his kindness and friendship. The media had noted the manner of his death as a terrible curiosity, rather than dig into his motivations, and quickly moved on to other topics. The planet continued to heat up. “I don’t believe David or Wynn’s acts will drive change but maybe I’m wrong, and God bless them if it does,” said Kaelber. “But it really is no way to do things. There is a better way.”  In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800-273-8255 and online chat is also available.

5/19/2022,"Families from the UK who are heading abroad for the spring half-term break continue to face a complex array of Covid testing requirements as restrictions for popular destinations remain in place.While the UK has relaxed all Covid travel restrictions, many other countries have retained a variety of test requirements before holidaymakers can enter.On Sunday (15 May) Spain announced that it was extending its entry rules until at least 15 June, meaning adults must be fully vaccinated before travelling to the Spanish mainland, Canary Islands or the Balearics. Unvaccinated children can travel, but those aged 12 and over need to show a certificate of Covid recovery or take a negative PCR test no more than 72 hours before they travel.Spain’s rules are stricter than most other countries in Europe, with destinations such as Greece, Croatia and Austria lifting all restrictions on travellers, regardless of their vaccination status. Others, such as France and Turkey, allow unvaccinated holidaymakers to travel but only having completed a negative lateral flow or PCR test before they arrive.However, even here there are differences in approach, with Portugal and Cyprus both requiring lateral flow tests for the unvaccinated to be completed by a healthcare professional no more than 24 hours before departure, rather than allowing travellers to take their own swabs at home.For most countries, testing requirements start with children aged 12 and over, but the rules are different for families going to Italy, where anyone who is unvaccinated and over six must prove their Covid status with a test.The US is stricter still, with every traveller aged two and above required to complete a Covid test no more than 24 hours before they travel, regardless of their vaccination status.“It’s great to see people are travelling abroad again, but as individual countries are responsible for their own Covid testing rules, passengers must remain wary to ensure they’ve taken the right tests for their destination,” said Nick Markham, co founder at Cignpost ExpressTest, which operates testing centres at airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, Birmingham and Edinburgh.“The risk is that they can’t get a last-minute test in time for their flight, so prebooking the right test at the airport should be thought of as a holiday essential, like buying insurance or finding the best deal for your travel money.“With testing rules changing regularly and often at short notice, we advise people keep checking the requirements for their destination to make sure they don’t get caught out.” Families who navigate the Covid testing requirements must also keep on top of rules for wearing face masks, with the EU recently announcing that coverings are no longer required on flights to many EU countries.

5/19/2022,"Pre-orders of Deborah James’s second book have soared within days of it becoming available. The podcast host’s memoir-cum-self-help volume is topping the Amazon UK bestsellers list, ahead of Richard Osman’s popular crime novel The Man Who Died Twice. The publication of How to Live When You Could Be Dead was brought forward this week, after the news that the author hasn’t long to live. It will now come out in August, rather than January next year, as first planned. James, who is 40, was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in 2016, and was told by doctors that she had a less than 8% chance of surviving the next five years. Since then, the former secondary school deputy headteacher has hosted BBC Radio 5 live’s You, Me and the Big C podcast about cancer, and has raised more than £5.7m for Cancer Research UK through her Bowelbabe fund on JustGiving. Last week she was made a dame for her campaign work, and presented with the honour by the Duke of Cambridge at her parents’ home. This came just days after she revealed that she had moved into hospice care with her family. “Every now and then, someone captures the heart of the nation with their zest for life and tenacious desire to give back to society,” the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said in a statement, which named James as “one of those special people”. They praised her “tireless efforts to raise awareness of bowel cancer and end the stigma of treatment”. James’s husband, Sebastien Bowen, arranged for her to visit RHS Garden Wisley in Surrey to celebrate the launch of How to Live When You Could Be Dead, which she described on Instagram as a “bit of a mission but worth it!” She explained that she hadn’t been able to leave the house in 10 days because of her health, and while, after the visit, she planned to “snooze for most of the day”, she loved being reminded “of vibrant green life all around, despite the sadness of knowing the state of my body inside”. She added that she was “blown away and utterly grateful” to those who have pre-ordered the title. While James’s first book, F*** You Cancer, acted as a kind of “cancer coach”, helping readers to navigate a cancer diagnosis, How to Live When You Could Be Dead promotes the growth mindset theory, in which James is a passionate believer. Drawing on her own experience of living longer than doctors expected, James explores the benefits of living “in the now” and learning “to value one day at a time”. Announcing the change of publication date on Instagram, James described the book as a way to share what she has learned about “how to have a positive mindset when we are faced with life’s biggest challenges”. The new publication date will still be, she said, long after she’s “flying high” but “hopefully a little less longer for you to wait”. For every copy sold in the UK, £3 will go to the Bowelbabe Fund.

5/19/2022,"The Tottenham and England forward Chioma Ubogagu has publicly apologised after she was suspended from football for nine months for taking a banned substance. Ubogagu, 29, was found to have consumed Canrenone, a prohibited substance often used as a masking agent, as part of an anti-acne treatment. A Football Association hearing found that Ubogagu had used the substance innocently but should have checked with authorities that it was appropriate for use. Her suspension was announced after the end of a disciplinary process but has been in place since the beginning of the year and will run until 18 September, after the start of the Women’s Super League season. “I am so sorry to my teammates and staff that I can’t be out on the pitch” Ubogagu said. “The cub has been fully supportive throughout this entire process, and I am so appreciative of all their help. My faith, family and close friends have helped me immensely in this difficult time. I am eager to be back soon now that this has been resolved. “I want to make clear that the medication had no performance-enhancing effects for me, but I still made the mistake of not being as diligent as possible, and as a result I am unable to play the game I love until I serve my suspension. While my dermatologist is aware of my profession, it is also my responsibility to know more about the medications I am prescribed.” Ubogagu, who was born in London but moved to Texas as a child and was educated in the US, joined Spurs from Real Madrid last summer and has three England caps, the most recent of which she won in March 2019. On 7 October she gave a urine sample that was found to test positive for Canrenone. A disciplinary process was undertaken which ended on 22 April. An FA regulatory commission investigating the case found that Ubogagu had experienced nodulocystic acne for most of her life and been prescribed a new drug by her dermatologist in Texas. Although the commission ruled that the player should have done more to establish it was safe to take the medicine, it also found she had acted without “significant” fault or negligence. She had also co-operated fully with authorities and the commission’s judgment reduced Ubogagu’s punishment from a standard two-year ban.",Sport/Football,Tottenham’s Chioma Ubogagu gets nine-month ban over banned substance,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/tottenhams-chioma-ubogagu-gets-nine-month-ban-over-banned-substance
5/19/2022,"The UK government has announced plans to accelerate the delivery of abortion services in Northern Ireland almost three years after they were legalised in the region. Brandon Lewis, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, told parliament on Thursday he was introducing legislation to bypass local authorities who had delayed the rollout of services. The new regulations will remove the need for Northern Ireland’s Department of Health to seek approval from the Stormont executive to provide services. “Women and girls are still unable to access high-quality abortion and post-abortion care in Northern Ireland. This is entirely unacceptable,” Lewis said in a written ministerial statement. The regulations are designed to override the Stormont executive, where the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has led resistance to abortion services, and give the secretary of state the same power as the region’s health minister to deliver the services. The Department of Health would have no further barriers to commission and fund services and should do so without delay, said Lewis. “If the Department of Health does not commission and fund abortion services as directed, I will intervene further.” Abortion was legalised in Northern Ireland in October 2019, bringing it into line with the rest of the UK, after a Westminster vote led by the Labour MP Stella Creasy. Access to abortion has been available since April 2020 after the legislation came into force but has been largely restricted to early medical terminations up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. Most people in Northern Ireland supported decriminalisation, but Robin Swann, the Ulster Unionist health minister, declined to commission services, saying such a step required consensus in the five-party power-sharing executive, and the DUP was opposed. Some other parties also fear upsetting socially conservative supporters. The UK government had told Stormont to commission services by March. The deadline came and went, prompting a clamour for action from abortion rights groups. “This is a welcome and necessary move,” said Grainne Teggart, campaigns manager for Amnesty International UK. “Once again, action from Westminster is needed to ensure that abortion rights are realised here. Commissioned services, accessible to all who need them, are long overdue.” Ruairi Rowan, director of advocacy and policy for Informing Choices NI, said interim services were “precarious” and that they denied timely access to counselling and funding.",News/UK news,UK government to accelerate abortion services delivery in Northern Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/uk-abortion-services-delivery-northern-ireland
5/19/2022,"The sounds of war have become louder in Belgorod, a mid-sized Russian city about 25 miles (40km) from the Ukrainian border. And the blasts are more frequent. “On Sunday, we were woken up again by explosions. You never know if it’s them or us firing,” said Vladimir, a shopkeeper in the city. Locals such as Vladimir first witnessed Russia’s military buildup at the start of the year, when thousands of troops amassed near Belgorod prior to Moscow’s attack in late February. “When the conflict started, we would hear rockets being launched into Ukraine. But now we get hit too. It is a different sound.” As the war has dragged on and Russia failed in its objective to quickly seize Kyiv, officials in Belgorod and other border cities have in recent weeks reported a series of attacks by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine has not directly accepted responsibility but has described the incidents as payback and “karma” for Russia, almost three months after it invaded its neighbour. The apparent Ukrainian attacks, which started when two helicopters struck an oil depot in Belgorod on 1 April, have brought a new element into the war, raising the previously unthinkable possibility that some of the devastating damage that Moscow has inflicted on Ukraine will come to Russia’s own territory. “We talk a lot about what is happening, of course. The atmosphere in the city is sort of tense,” said Anna, a local teacher. “Life goes on, but sometimes it is impossible to ignore it, like the time the city was in thick smoke,” she said, referring to the fuel depot attack. In this week alone, officials in Belgorod reported at least three attacks. Last week, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, claimed a strike on a small town in the area had killed one Russian civilian. During the last week, Ukrainian forces have recaptured villages from Russian troops north and north-east of Kharkiv, pushing them back towards the border near Belgorod. This has given some relief to Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which is only an hour’s drive from Belgorod and has been under enemy bombardment since the war began in February. And while the consensus among military experts remains that Ukraine will not aim for a push into Russian territory, its advances have been met with unease in Belgorod and across Russia. In a recent live Q and A with locals, Gladkov was forced to answer questions from worried voters about what the recent Ukrainian advances would mean for Belgorod. The governor tried to offer reassurance but admitted that certain parts of the region were under “constant shelling”. He has also raised the city threat levels to “yellow”, the second-highest in a three-tier system, and a heavier police presence was now being felt across the city, according to Anna. There have also been reports of two fires at defence ministry facilities in the Belgorod region as well as damage inflicted to a key Russian railway bridge, leading to speculation that Ukrainian saboteurs have been active on Russian territory. Russian officials have not commented on the incidents, and it remains unclear what caused the fires. Nikita Parmenov, a journalist at the independent Fonar outlet, said the lack of information regarding some of the recent fires has led to “fears and gossip that Ukrainians have infiltrated the towns and villages in the region”. Still, despite the direct threat posed by Ukraine, Parmenov said there were no visible signs of an upsurge in patriotism in Belgorod. “Many here have direct links with Ukraine, they talk to relatives across the border. It feels like we have a better understanding of what is going on than most regions in Russia,” said the journalist, who has himself been in contact with his aunt from Odesa. “Enthusiasm for the special military operation feels muted. It has torn some families apart, while others prefer not to speak about the conflict with their friends and siblings in Ukraine.” But it is not just Ukrainian attacks that have disrupted life on Russia’s borderlands – the war has had broader effects, too. Since the start of the invasion, Moscow has suspended the work of 11 airports in parts of central and southern Russia that are close to Ukraine, citing the “difficult situation surrounding Ukraine”, and hindering travel for millions of Russians. Among the airports shut are those serving popular holiday destinations, including some in the annexed Crimean peninsula and the Black Sea resort towns of Gelendzhik and Krasnodar. “I am expecting a disastrous summer holiday season,” said one hotel owner in Sevastopol. During the first weekend of May, when Russians usually travel to the country’s south, the hotel occupancy rate in Crimea was 10–15%, according to a study by the Russian business outlet Kommersant. The Crimean tourism industry expects that up to 70% of hotel rooms will remain empty over the summer holidays because of difficulties travelling to Crimea and worries that the peninsula is too close to the war. “It is going to be a tough summer,” said the owner of the mid-sized Crimean hotel. “But in war, you have to make sacrifices.”",News/World news,"‘Now we get hit too’: Belgorod, the Russian city on the Ukraine frontline",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/belgorod-the-russian-city-on-the-ukraine-frontline
5/19/2022,"Chinty Turnbull fully expects people will say she’s taken leave of her senses as she outlines her bold plan of action. She wants to reclaim a Lake District honeypot town – “buy it back, brick by brick”. “I think a lot of people think I am mad, yes,” she said. “What’s that scene in Jerry Maguire when everyone is saying yay, great, good for you! And they’re all going ‘oh my God’.” Keswick is overrun by holiday lets, often owned by second and sometimes third homeowners. Go into an estate agent and the sea of “sold” signs leaps out. About 80% of buyers in the town are not local. Campaigners say the life is being sucked out of the Lake District because soon none of the people who work there will be able to afford to live there. Businesses already struggle to recruit staff. It is a picture replicated in tourist towns across the UK, but the situation in Keswick is acute. One estate agent said he had known nothing like it in his 35 years in the business. About 10 days ago Turnbull was told that her building, where she runs an eco-cafe, was up for sale. The assumption is that the four rented flats upstairs will become holiday lets. The news prompted her to set up a campaign called Buy Back Keswick, Brick By Brick. She needs to raise £825,000 to buy the building and has already been pledged £65,000. “When we raise the money it will become a community building, with rental money used to restore it,” she said. “That will be one building looked after and then with whatever is left we will go on to another building. We will find these delicate buildings and we will preserve them and we’ll make them places where local people can live.” Turnbull said there had been much debate about places such as Keswick being dominated by holiday lets and now action was needed. “Holiday homes are fine but, you know, enough is enough. No more. People feel powerless. They don’t feel like they have any control.” It is a wildly optimistic project but Turnbull has been buoyed up by the feedback she has received from all over the UK. “I do think we can do it. People generally don’t think you can do things which make a difference but I think we can. If 800 people put a grand in then it could work, couldn’t it? It would show people that you can make things better. We want to buy one property, then another one, then another and another. “There are lots of buildings which used to be butchers or bakers and we can reclaim them. It is not just the millionaires who have control; it can be anybody if you really want it.” Taking on the millionaires is, however, undeniably a big challenge. Nick Elgey, a sales manager at Hackney & Leigh estate agents in Keswick, said about 80% of his buyers were not local. That is not a new phenomenon but the pandemic has sped things up. “We’ve never really seen such frenzied activity in such a concentrated period.” People with cash, inherited or earned, have been particularly desperate to buy in and around Keswick. A four-bedroom cottage in Borrowdale once owned by the film-maker Ken Russell was bought last month within two weeks of going on the market, for more than £1.5m. “People want to invest their money in bricks and mortar and they feel the Lake District national park is a safe haven,” Elgey said. It was a “thorny issue”, he said, but the other side to the coin was the amount of money holiday lets brought in to the local economy. In Keswick, the occupancy rate year-round is 90%, he said. “At the end of the day, what can you do about market forces? Keswick is a stunning location. It has national if not international interest. People want to buy there.” Turnbull argues it’s time to do something. “There’s nothing wrong with people having second homes if there’s space and room for everyone else,” she said. “If you want people serving coffee, cleaning holiday homes, sweeping up … then they need to be able to live here.”",News/UK news,Lake District cafe owner fights holiday lets with plan to ’buy back’ town,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/lake-district-cafe-owner-fights-holiday-lets-with-plan-to-buy-back-town-keswick

Occupation Solicitor Voting record Has always voted Labour but is currently having doubts about Keir Starmer’s leadership Amuse bouche Marcia has just finished writing her first novel Kieran I arrived a little early, and when Marcia arrived she seemed a little stand-offish. Marcia He seemed like a genial chap. White, middle-aged, spoke very tenderly about his partner. Kieran I hadn’t really considered that it might be confrontational. I hoped it wouldn’t. Marcia I had pork belly bites, and a fillet steak so tender I could have cut it with a butter knife. Kieran I had the duck croquettes – they were delicious.  Marcia The area we were furthest apart on was immigration. Kieran When I talk about this, I am not referring to refugees. I believe profoundly that anyone fleeing persecution, war or violence should be welcomed and provided for unreservedly. The problem is, you can’t just magic up the infrastructure necessary to support 250,000 people a year. It felt a bit like Marcia thought it would just happen. Marcia The problem isn’t the numbers, it’s the deliberate underinvestment in services. I pointed out that the NHS would never have got off the ground without immigration, and it would collapse tomorrow if all foreign-born workers left. I genuinely think Britain owes an unacknowledged debt of gratitude to immigrants. Kieran I worried that Marcia felt I was in favour of a blanket ban on immigration and that I’d want migrants returned to their home countries. I just feel we need to get our house in order before we have more friends over to stay. Marcia During the pandemic, so many put their lives on the line. But once it was deemed to be over, it’s back to business as usual for outlets like the Daily Mail and their migrant-bashing. Kieran quickly pointed out that he did not read the Daily Mail. Kieran On paper, we disagreed about whether statues should be removed, but when we talked about it, we were of the same view. Marcia didn’t think all figures like Colston should just be taken down, and I didn’t feel all statues should simply remain as they are. Marcia Kieran talked about erasing history. My argument was that in the case of Colston, Bristol had chosen to erect a statue to a mass murderer. The best place for it is in a museum, with a full explanation of what he did. Kieran It was a great learning experience. I would love to have spent more time with Marcia. She knew a lot about US history, and our own. Marcia We also talked about confederate statues, and Kieran was unaware that most of these were erected long after the US civil war. In my view, they were part of a concerted effort to terrorise black people. Kieran I took (and still take) the view that most people are inherently “good” – not sexist, racist, not prejudiced. So by extension, the police force would be filled with people who are passionate about helping those in need. Marcia The heavy-handed response to demonstrations after the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer was a classic example of institutional sexism. Not to mention the number of female officers who have identified a culture of sexism, and the retaliation against them when they spoke out about it. I think Kieran felt I was saying that every single police officer is sexist. Kieran I struggled with this. It left me in a bit of a crisis about whether or not the majority of people are actually good. Marcia I was pleasantly surprised at how open-minded Kieran was. He said he hasn’t given much thought to the issues we discussed, particularly those that touched on race. Kieran I found myself considering my life in a way that I haven’t before. The fact that I have never thought about white privilege in the past is, I’m sure, because I’ve benefited from it.
