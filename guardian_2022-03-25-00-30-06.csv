3/25/2022,"The attorney general of Texas has declared a school district’s celebration of LGBTQ+ students “sex education” and in violation of Texas law. For the past eight years, students in the Austin Independent school district have held a district-wide Pride week as a chance to celebrate LGBTQ+ students, staff and families in the district, according to the district’s website. But on Tuesday, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, sent a letter to the school district calling Pride week “sex education” and notifying the school that without parental consent, the celebration is “breaking state law”. “The Texas legislature has made it clear that when it comes to sex education, parents – not school districts – are in charge,” said Paxton in his letter shared to Twitter. “By hosting ‘Pride week’, your district has, at best, undertaken a week-long instructional effort in human sexuality without parental consent,” continued Paxton. “Or, worse, your district is cynically pushing a week-long indoctrination of your students that not only fails to obtain parental consent, but subtly cuts parents out of the loop. Either way, you are breaking state law.” The school district’s superintendent, Dr Stephanie S Elizalde, responded to the attorney general’s comments about 45 minutes after Paxton posted his letter. “I want all our LGBTQIA+ students to know that we are proud of them and that we will protect them against political attacks,” said Elizalde on Twitter. District spokesperson Jason Stanford spoke with the Washington Post and shared a similar message: “We’re going to react to this by doubling down on making sure our kids feel safe and celebrating Pride.” Stanford also noted that Paxton’s letter was politically motivated as Paxton faces a primary runoff with another Republican in May and is being investigated by the FBI for bribery and abuse of office. “This is not a parental rights issue,” said Stanford to the Post. “This is a Ken Paxton trying to score political points issue.” In recent weeks, Paxton has targeted LGBTQ+ youth in Texas. In addition to the letter, last month, Paxton wrote an opinion stating that gender-affirming care for children was “child abuse” under Texas law, prompting the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, to instruct the state’s child protection services to investigate parents providing their children with that care. When a judge temporarily blocked Abbott’s order, Paxton asked the state supreme court to overturn the ban. After the Pride week’s agenda was shared online, some administrators in the Austin Independent school district had their personal information posted online and have received death threats, reported KUT, a local news affiliate. Students were forced to have pride celebrations inside as police were stationed outside. “The kids had no idea what was going on, but the teachers were afraid to go to work,” said Stanford. “So the last thing we’re worried about is what Ken Paxton has to say.”",News/US news,Texas attorney general says school district’s Pride week ‘breaks state law’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/texas-attorney-general-pride-week-breaking-state-law
3/25/2022,"One of Gordon Brown’s few and oft-repeated jokes was that there are two kinds of chancellor: those who fail, and those who get out in time. Despite having served little more than two years in the job, Rishi Sunak may have missed the moment to quit – or move next door – while he was ahead, according to Thursday’s front pages at least. Even George Osborne’s pasty tax/granny tax/caravan tax “omnishambles” budget of 2012 did not fall apart so fast – though Sunak’s supporters may take comfort in the fact the Tories went on to win the next election. The economic backdrop he faces is grim and unenviable. But the deliberate political decision not to provide additional help for the hardest hit, while pre-announcing a tax cut clearly timed to suit the electoral cycle, looked uncaring and cynical. Even the pro-government Daily Express front page said: “The forgotten millions say: what about us?” Sunak’s fumbled defence of his policies in a string of awkward and sometimes tetchy media interviews – including a showdown on LBC with a single mum who cannot afford to keep the heating on – did not help. Back in the dark days at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the chancellor’s smooth delivery offered a reassuring contrast to Boris Johnson’s dishevelled style and mixed messages. Just shy of 42, he came of age in the Blair years, and can speak to a younger generation than the prime minister, whose classical allusions and dated cultural references set him apart. It was Sunak who told the public he would do “whatever it takes” to protect their livelihoods through lockdown – and the policy for which he is best known, the £69bn furlough scheme, met the urgency of the moment. Yet he has spent much of the time since then, trying to redraw his political image, from saviour of the working man, to dry-as-dust Thatcherite tax-cutter: Philip Hammond in a hoodie. He wanted to turn off the furlough scheme in autumn 2020, before Covid cases surged again and made clear that would be a dangerous mistake. He pushed through cuts to overseas aid, and insisted on removing the £1,000 a year boost to universal credit that had helped the poorest households through the crisis (though he then partly reversed that move, by cutting the taper rate). He announced a slew of tax increases in a bid to get the public finances back in shape – including freezing personal tax thresholds and hiking corporation tax – yet ended October’s budget with a stirring promise of future tax cuts. Wednesday’s spring statement included that crowd-pleasing cut in fuel duty, but nothing for those reliant on state benefits, aside from £500m extra for a local council hardship fund – an omission one senior Tory put down to Sunak being “allergic to welfare”. All that suits the political predilections of the Tory rightwingers who would be his most obvious first-round backers in a future leadership contest. Yet at the same time, by appearing tin-eared, it has reopened nagging questions about his political savvy. His string of clunky media appearances also pointed to an awkwardness with ordinary voters that was invisible during the pandemic, at the Downing Street podium; and a failure to grasp how the other half live. In just one example, he cited his favourite seeded Hovis bread as one of the staples whose price is going up, before adding: “We have all different breads in my house.” He also has a swimming pool, a condo in the couple’s spiritual second home of California, and – in his wife’s case – a £700m stake in the tech giant Infosys. All of which might not matter so much, if the cost of living crisis was not front and centre of the public’s minds. Wednesday’s statement may also have accelerated a process pollsters say has been happening for some time. Now he’s no longer paying wages from the public purse, and with the economic outlook darkening, voters may gradually be falling out of love with Sunak. A snap poll carried out by YouGov on Wednesday had 69% of respondents saying he had not done enough to tackle the cost of living crisis. Not so long ago, the polished Sunak seemed the obvious successor to the prime minister, who was blundering insouciantly from one crisis to another. But with a tough 12 months ahead, it appears increasingly likely the peak of the chancellor’s popularity – the moment when he could have “got out in time” – has already passed.",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak’s spring statement reopens questions about his political savvy,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/24/rishi-sunak-spring-statement-questions-about-his-political-savvy
3/25/2022,"The Finn Klaus Mäkelä is still only 26, but he has already risen supersonically through the conducting ranks. He’s currently at the helm of two leading European orchestras, the Oslo Philharmonic and the Orchestre de Paris, and has become only the third conductor in the history of the label to be signed to an exclusive recording contract by Decca, following in the footsteps of Georg Solti and Riccardo Chailly. Whether Mäkelä will prove to be an artist on a par with those distinguished predecessors remains to be seen, but his debut with the company is certainly a statement of intent – a complete cycle of the Sibelius symphonies with the Oslo orchestra, recorded in the Norwegian capital last year. Of course, there’s no shortage of outstanding cycles of these symphonies already available, and in the final analysis Mäkelä’s set does not challenge the second of Colin Davis’s three versions, say, or either of those conducted by Osmo Vänskä. It’s frustratingly uneven, with performances veering between the outstanding and the prosaic, though the orchestral playing is consistently fine. Mäkelä’s approach to the First Symphony sets the tone for much of what follows; he seems to treat the work more like a symphonic poem than as a rigorous piece of symphonic architecture, with a succession of brightly coloured episodes that don’t necessarily connect, and while the First is by far the most diffuse and derivative of Sibelius’s symphonies, it’s a more cogent work than he suggests. Underlining the set’s unevenness, though, the First is followed by a superb account of the Second Symphony, which perfectly encapsulates its mix of organic rigour and rugged defiance. This and Mäkelä’s account of the dark, brooding Fourth, which is suitably austere and never over-interpreted, are the highlights of his cycle, while the Third is probably its low point, with no sense of coherence at all. In the Fifth, the great turning points – the transition from the opening movement into scherzo, and the emergence of the glorious “swan theme” in the finale, two of the most thrilling moments in 20th-century music – are made to seem almost matter-of-fact, while the performances of Sixth and Seventh are thoroughly accomplished in a rather detached way, but nothing more. The Seventh is followed by the last of Sibelius’s tone poems, Tapiola, revisiting the chilly landscapes explored in that symphony, and also by three fragments, less than four minutes of music altogether, which are thought to be all that survives of the score of an eighth symphony that Sibelius seems to have destroyed sometime during the second world war. It may bring one of the greatest of all symphonic journeys full circle, but the performances themselves leave many questions unanswered en route.",Arts/Music,Sibelius: The Symphonies and Tapiola review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/24/sibelius-the-symphonies-and-tapiola-review-klaus-makela-oslo-philharmonic
3/25/2022,"The high court in London has ruled that the former Spanish king Juan Carlos does not have sovereign immunity in the case brought against him by an ex-lover who has accused the royal of using Spain’s national intelligence agency to harass and threaten her after they broke up. The decision means the monarch – who abdicated in favour of his son, Felipe, amid waning public popularity in 2014 – could now face trial if the case proceeds. In December last year, lawyers for Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein told the court their client was seeking damages for the “great mental pain, alarm, anxiety, distress, loss of wellbeing, humiliation and moral stigma she has suffered” after the end of her relationship with Juan Carlos. They said that in 2012 the king had sent Félix Sanz Roldán – the then head of Spain’s National Intelligence Centre – to London to warn Sayn-Wittgenstein that neither her safety nor that of her children could be guaranteed if she did not follow his instructions. Sayn-Wittgenstein also claims she returned to her home in Switzerland later that day where she discovered a book about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and subsequently received a cryptic phone call about tunnels, which she took to be an allusion to the princess’s fatal crash in 1997. Lawyers for the former monarch rejected the claims and any allegations of wrongdoing “in the strongest terms”. They also argued sovereign immunity should apply because the only way Juan Carlos could have persuaded officials from Spain’s intelligence agency to act on his behalf was because he either was or had been the king. Juan Carlos’s actions were “quintessentially public acts because of who the person is”, Daniel Bethlehem QC told the court, adding: “Such alleged conduct, even if abusive or unlawful, would have been in His Majesty’s official capacity.” But in a ruling released on Thursday, Mr Justice Nicklin rejected the claim that Juan Carlos was entitled to personal immunity on the grounds that he remained a “sovereign” despite abdicating. He noted that Juan Carlos had used the title of King Emeritus since leaving the throne, but said: “Whatever his special constitutional position following abdication, the defendant is neither the sovereign nor the head of state of Spain.” The judge also said he was satisfied that Juan Carlos – who has lived in the United Arab Emirates for almost two years – could no longer be seen as a member of the “royal household” and was therefore not covered by any possible attendant constitutional immunity. “For the reasons set out above, my decision is that none of the grounds on which state immunity was claimed have been made out,” he ruled. “The claim will therefore continue.” Robin Rathmell, of Kobre & Kim, counsel to Sayn-Wittgenstein, said the judgment demonstrated that the former king could not “hide behind position, power or privilege” in the face of the claim. “Juan Carlos de Borbón y Borbón will now be answerable to an English court for his actions as a private individual,” Rathmell said. “This is the first step on the road to justice; the appalling facts of this case will finally be brought before the court.” The 84-year-old left Spain for Abu Dhabi in August 2020 after a series of damaging allegations were made about his business dealings that further dented his already battered reputation and embarrassed King Felipe. In March 2020, Felipe stripped Juan Carlos of his annual stipend and renounced his own personal inheritance from his father after reports that he was in line to receive millions of euros from a secret offshore fund with ties to Saudi Arabia. But the former king was understood to be considering a return to Spain after prosecutors shelved three separate investigations into his financial affairs earlier this month, citing insufficient evidence, the statute of limitations and the monarch’s constitutional immunity.",News/World news,"Spain’s former king can face trial in UK over harassment claims, court rules",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/spains-former-king-can-face-trial-over-harassment-claims-high-court-rules
3/25/2022,"A “fearless” Somali female MP was among dozens of people killed in a series of bomb attacks in rural Somalia on Wednesday. According to a witness quoted by the Associated Press, the bomber ran towards and embraced opposition MP Amina Mohamed Abdi before detonating a bomb as she campaigned in the town of Beledweyne in central Somalia ahead of parliamentary elections this week. At least 48 people were killed in the attacks, according to Ali Abdullahi Hussein, president of Hirshabelle state. The local police chief, Col Isak Ali Abdulle, said the authorities were still trying to establish the total number of fatalities. At least 30 people were killed when a car bomb was detonated outside a hospital. The militant group al-Shabaab have claimed responsibility for the attacks. Earlier on Wednesday, at least six people were killed when two al-Shabaab gunmen tried to storm Mogadishu’s Aden Adde international airport.

The Somali prime minister, Mohamed Hussein Roble, said Abdi’s killing was an “attempt to disrupt justice” in Tahlil’s case. In September, the head of the country’s intelligence agency, Nisa, was fired over the handling of Tahlil’s disappearance. MP Abdirizak Mohamed tweeted: “Somalia has lost a promising giant leader, an activist, a fearless advocate who finally paid the ultimate price for seeking justice for Ikran Tahlil. We spent time chatting yesterday and I was moved by her intellect, optimism and plans for Somalia.” Former minister of commerce and industry, Khadra Dualeh, said she had been concerned for Abdi’s safety and recently told her to leave the country. “Amina knew they [the authorities] would stop at nothing to deny her contesting her MP seat. However, she was fearless, courageous and fought valiantly as well as conscientiously for her principles,” Dualeh said.

3/25/2022,"Canada has barred its soldiers from joining Ukraine’s “international brigade” of foreign fighters, amid growing concern that captured troops could be used as a Russian propaganda tool. Speaking to Canadian parliament’s defence committee on Wednesday, Lt Gen Frances Allen, the vice-chief of the defence staff, said top brass had issued an order preventing full-time service members and part-time reservists from travelling to join Ukraine’s newly formed foreign legion. The rule, which also applies to soldiers on leave, follows a call last month from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for volunteers to defend his country from Russia’s invasion. Thousands are believed to have answered, including enough Canadians to form their own battalion – the Canadian Ukrainian Brigade. While some veterans have used their skills for humanitarian work, others have picked up arms. The only Canadian soldiers permitted to enter Ukraine are those with formal approval from Wayne Eyre, the chief of defence staff, said Allen. Canada had previously sent 250 military trainers to Ukraine, but those troops were moved to Poland before Russia invaded. Canadian officials have long been clear that they discourage travel to the region, but the foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, had previously said she was sympathetic to the Ukrainian Canadians wishing to defend the country. Canada has the largest Ukrainian diaspora outside Russia. “We understand that people of Ukrainian descent want to support their fellow Ukrainians and also that there is a desire to defend the motherland and in that sense it is their own individual decision,” Joly said in early March. “Let me be clear: we are all very supportive of any form of support to Ukrainians right now.” Much of that aid has been humanitarian, as well as shipments of weapons. Canada has also offered to accept an “unlimited” number of Ukrainians seeking temporary refuge. The warnings from Allen come as Russia has threatened criminal prosecutions against foreigners captured fighting in Ukraine. Allen also told lawmakers that captured Canadians could become a propaganda tool for Moscow as the Kremlin looks to wage its own information war amid heavy losses on the battlefield. “Foreigners who may be engaged in the country can be used in ways that are difficult and counterproductive to the work that is going on there through the disinformation campaigns that we know that Russia is very apt to use,” she said.",News/World news,Canada bars its soldiers from joining Ukraine’s foreign legion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/canada-bars-soldiers-joining-ukraine-foreign-legion
3/25/2022,"My friend and colleague Bill Clark, who has died aged 70 of a brain haemorrhage, was a video producer and film-maker. Throughout a long career in commercials and corporate video production he shared talent, enthusiasm and generosity across the creative industries. At heart Bill was a storyteller, drawn to fiction and to film. The cast for his first feature, The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey (2007) included a young Saoirse Ronan. I was privileged to be a producer on his second feature, Starfish (2016), starring Joanne Froggatt and Tom Riley. Bill learned from a former colleague, Nic Ray, how her husband’s near-fatal sepsis infection had devastated their lives. Bill’s creative approach was collaborative, bold in the unblinking depiction of what an individual and a family can endure. Born in Epsom, Surrey, Bill was the son of Glenis (nee Evans) and Leonard Clark, who owned a printing business. He attended Wallington grammar school, Sutton, then Ewell Technical College for A-levels, where, as social secretary, he booked Genesis and Led Zeppelin to play – and an enduring love of the music business was born. In 1974, having expanded the family print business into graphics, he was introduced to Hilary Walker, who worked in promotions for EMI Records. Bill started producing marketing materials for EMI, including work on album covers for a young Kate Bush. A date at Hammersmith Odeon with a fellow EMI employee, Deborah Kirrage, led to marriage in 1979. In 1981 Bill moved to Rutland, in the east Midlands, and founded the commercials and corporate video companies William Clark Productions then Origami. The companies thrived through the 80s and 90s, offering chances to bright young creatives on campaigns for, among others, BMW, Lancôme and Power Rangers, as well as music promotions. The move from the commercials, which Bill always treated as 30-second feature films, was inspired by a Christmas gift to his daughter of the book The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey by Susan Wojciechowski. Bill decided this should be his first feature and set off with more determination than experience to acquire the film rights. Development of the second film followed while he continued to work in commercials. Bill never pulled his punches and Starfish was a searing yet ultimately uplifting film. Tom Ray commented: “Society seeks to hide, ignore and disregard the experience of disability, but Starfish speaks for me and for everyone afflicted by sudden loss.” Following cinematic release, Starfish expanded awareness of sepsis around the world. Other projects bubbled, such as a TV series in development based on his Welsh grandfather’s mining community, and Bill continued to give time and energy unstintingly to those around him. He is survived by Debbie, their children, Edward and Celia, a grandson, Alfie, and his brother, Paul.",Arts/Film,Bill Clark obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/24/bill-clark-obituary
3/25/2022,"My mother, Cecily Haynes-Hart, who has died aged 95 from Alzheimer’s, began her teaching career at the age of 16 in Guyana. After emigrating to the UK, she taught in south London schools, and was a cornerstone of the Caribbean Teachers’ Association, determined to raise achievement and foster leadership in young people of African-Caribbean heritage. She was born in Georgetown, the third of four children of Clementina Pollydore, a housewife who also reared and sold poultry, and her husband, Joseph Jordan, who died when Cecily was young. It was apparent early on that Cecily was gifted academically. She had a photographic memory and could remember an entire book, practically word for word, after reading it once. She topped the country in national examinations as a child. Cecily became a pupil teacher at 16, teaching children of her own age and younger at her school, Carmel Roman Catholic school, in Georgetown. She subsequently graduated from the Teachers’ Training College and returned to Carmel to teach, then moved to Mackenzie All-Age school in Linden and finally St Pius Roman Catholic school in Georgetown, where she prepared children (including my sisters and me) for the common entrance exam for secondary schools. She was also the deputy headteacher and acting headteacher, and specialised in choral speaking. In 1955 she married Basil Haynes (whom she had met at the doctor’s surgery), an insurance salesman who later formed his own insurance company. They had three daughters and a son. In 1971, she emigrated permanently to the UK, settling in south London; first in Balham, then New Cross, where the rest of the family joined her. My father emigrated to the US in the mid-1970s after they had divorced amicably. My mother then became Cecily Haynes-Hart, following her union with RBO (Robert) Hart, a barrister and fellow educator; they had a happy partnership until his death in 1984. Cecily lived in New Cross for nearly 46 years. She was the head of maths at Peckham Manor school and then South East London school, in Deptford, which later became West Greenwich school. After retiring, she became the headteacher of the Robert Hart Memorial Supplementary school in Peckham, created to raise achievement and self-esteem in children deemed failures in their schools, a post she held until she was nearly 80. She was also a Foundation Trust member of King’s College hospital and was a mainstay of the Caribbean Teachers’ Association and its off-shoot, the Teaching and Educational Project, which through effective teaching and mentoring guided young people into employment. She was chair of governors at several schools. A brilliant teacher, mentor, friend, sister, mother-to-all, orator and mathematician with a degree in statistics and calculus from the Open University, Cecily also loved to play the piano and the violin, to sing and to dance, and was known for her warmth, elegance and deep faith. She moulded many students who attributed their success to her influence and wanting to emulate her. Cecily was predeceased by her son, Basil, and her granddaughter Chénee. She is survived by her three daughters, Wynette, Sharon and me, seven grandchildren, Aren, Kady, Xanthea, Joel, Jordan, Siobhan and Bryony, and her sister, Joyce.",News/Education,Cecily Haynes-Hart obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/24/cecily-haynes-hart-obituary
3/25/2022,"On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host spoke about “another day of grandstanding, speech-making and hissy-fitting” as supreme court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation hearings continued. He said that 58% of Americans support her, “the most support a Jackson has had since Thriller came out”. But Republicans have continued to find ways to attack her, led by Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham. He referred to them as “a three-ring circle jerk this week desperately trying to get a soundbite that might make it on to Fox News”. Jackson was asked to define what a woman is by Marsha Blackburn, someone Kimmel easily defined as “a horrible woman”. The judge said she wasn’t able to answer, which led to Cruz claiming she is the first ever nominee to struggle with the question. “She’s also the only one in history who’s been asked that disgusting question,” Kimmel said. Cruz continued down his transphobic route by claiming he could self-define as a woman if he wanted, which Kimmel said would make him “the world’s ugliest woman”. He went on to say “what a slug of a human being” while expressing sympathy for “this poor lady [who] had to sit there and listen to this pontificating”. This week has also seen Hilary Clinton reveal that she has Covid-19, which Kimmel said was “surprising for someone who’s been alone in the woods for six whole years”. While she had a positive test, her husband, Bill Clinton, remains negative. “That’s how deep we are in the upside-down world, Hilary caught a virus and Bill didn’t,” he joked. Joe Biden has also been travelling to Brussels this week, which led Kimmel to quip: “When Biden was a kid, Air Force One was a balloon.” He expressed nervousness over him flying, “the same feeling you get when your grandma renews her driver’s license”. The president was heading there to figure out a new round of sanctions against Russia but Kimmel wondered what else was left. “No more Frosted Mini-Wheats?” he asked. More information also came out about what happened to Mike Pence during the Capital riot in January. The former vice-president was reportedly taken to a loading dock beneath the building so he could be put into hiding. “It was tough to convince Pence to go along with the plan because any discussion of going through the back door makes him uncomfortable,” Kimmel joked.",Arts/Culture,Jimmy Kimmel on Ted Cruz: ‘What a slug of a human being’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/24/jimmy-kimmel-recap-ted-cruz-ketanji-brown-jackson
3/25/2022,"Russia has blocked Google News, accusing it of promoting “inauthentic information” about the invasion of Ukraine. The ban came just hours after Google announced it would not allow users worldwide to monetise content that “exploits, dismisses, or condones” the war. Google’s new policy affects any website, app or YouTube channel that earns revenue from advertising managed by the search engine. It has long had a policy that bars adverts from appearing next to any content that “incites violence” and says the new policy clarifies and expands those rules. “We can confirm that we’re taking additional steps to clarify, and in some instances expand, our monetisation guidelines as they relate to the war in Ukraine,” a Google spokesperson said. The company had already taken action against Russian state-funded media in late February, and paused all adverts for Russian users earlier this month. The latest ban could cut off funding to western media outlets supportive of Russia, even if ithey have no clear financial tie to the state itself. Within hours of Google’s new policy, the Russian internet regulator, Roskomnadzor, announced its own ban, blocking Google News in its entirety from internet users. “Based on a request from the Russian prosecutor general’s office, Roskomnadzor has restricted access to the internet service news.google in the country,” the body said in a statement. “The mentioned US internet news resource provided access to numerous publications and materials containing unreliable, publicly significant information about the course of the special military operation in Ukraine.” Roskomnadzor has been steadily taking action against US internet giants as the war in Ukraine has progressed. A week after Russia first invaded, it blocked Facebook and Twitter in apparent retaliation to those two companies removing Russian state media including RT and Sputnik from their platforms. The official explanation listed 26 cases of “discrimination” against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020. Initially, the ban focused only on Facebook itself, which has low penetration in Russia, sparing the popular apps Instagram and WhatsApp from a ban. But on 11 March, those were added to the block list, following a policy change from Facebook to allow Ukrainian users to make violent threats against Russian soldiers. “These are temporary measures designed to preserve voice and expression for people who are facing invasion,” Facebook said at the time.",News/World news,Russia blocks Google News after ad ban on content condoning Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/russia-blocks-google-news-after-it-bans-ads-on-proukraine-invasion-content
