2/24/2022,"The New South Wales government had made plans for a two-week shutdown of the state’s train system as early as last week, casting doubt on the timeline provided by the transport minister, David Elliott, about when he first knew about Monday’s network closure. Documents obtained through the Fair Work Commission reveal senior officials within the state’s transport department believed as early as Thursday last week that the state’s rail system would need to be shuttered for a fortnight if industrial action proposed by the Rail, Tram and Bus Union went ahead.  Ahead of the planned action, a risk assessment conducted by Sydney Trains finalised on 16 February concluded that the “risks associated” with the union’s planned action meant the rail system would need to be shut down. “On 17 February 2022, in view of the finalised risk assessment, the executive leadership team made the decision that the rail network could not be operated for the two-week period commencing 21 February 2022,” Sydney Trains acting chief customer officer, Jasbir Tumber, said in a statement to the FWC. The assessment was carried out before the RTBU agreed to amend its planned industrial action at the FWC on Saturday night, but it makes clear Sydney Trains did not believe the rail network would be able to operate without “altered working conditions”, which the union was committed to not undertaking. The existence of the document raises questions about the timeline previously provided by Elliott about when he first knew of the shutdown risk. Elliott on Wednesday blamed a communication breakdown for not alerting the premier, saying: “My office remained of the view until approximately 1.30[am Monday] that there would be a significant disruption to services but not a total network shutdown.” In question time on Thursday, Labor pushed both Elliott and the premier, Dominic Perrottet, on previous statements in which they insisted they were not aware of the shutdown despite the information having been circulated to various government departments. Asked during question time on Thursday whether the decision to close the network had been made on 17 February, Perrottet replied: “Not to my knowledge”. Elliott dodged questions on his knowledge of the shutdown, describing the submissions made by the department as “a contingency plan, an assessment”. “Assessments are done to assure that any potential contingency is addressed,” he said. “Assessments are done by government. Every time a department faces a dilemma, whether it be industrial action, whether it be a police operation, whether it be natural disaster, they do assessments to address all contingencies. “This isn’t rocket science. This is government 101.” During negotiations before the FWC over the weekend, the RTBU agreed to drop both a ban on overtime and alterations to rostering arrangements. However, it planned to push ahead with a ban on altered working, meaning staff only would perform shifts they were set without any changes. The documents submitted to the FWC show Sydney Trains did not believe the rail network would be able to operate without altered working conditions. On Thursday, NSW Labor leader, Chris Minns, said Elliott was not “up to the job” of transport minister. “We don’t think he’s up to the job. He’s either incompetent or is not being honest with the people of New South Wales. Millions of people have been inconvenienced as a result of this,” he said. While Elliott has previously told reporters he had an “inkling” of what might have occurred, he has defended not informing Perrottet of the shutdown because it was not a certainty. “I had no confirmation and I didn’t know exactly what action Transport for NSW would be taking,” he said this week.

On Tuesday he told parliament during question time that he knew about the closure early on Monday. Perrottet insisted on Wednesday that he retained confidence in Elliott as transport minister, while rebuking his decision to go to bed as transport scrambled to find a solution on Sunday night. The documents submitted to the FWC also reveal the NSW Treasury chief economist, Stephen Walters, had been informed of the likelihood of a two-week shutdown and had conducted modelling which forecast the cost of the shutdown as $33.3m a day and $370m for the full two weeks. The Department of Communities and Justice and the Department of Education also provided affidavits to the commission on the impacts of a shutdown.",News/Australia news,"NSW transport made plans for two-week rail shutdown as early as last week, documents show",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/nsw-transport-made-plans-for-two-week-rail-shutdown-as-early-as-last-week-documents-show
2/24/2022,"The New South Wales upper house has for a third time rejected laws to establish flood plain harvesting licences, arguing the state government’s plan would have led to an unsustainable amount of water being taken from the Murray-Darling river system. Labor, the Greens and some crossbenchers united to disallow the licences on Thursday morning, despite the new water minister, Kevin Anderson, moving preemptively to issue licence determinations on Monday.  The Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party abstained from the vote. The licensing of flood plain harvesting – the practice of capturing water as it moves across the extensive flat plains of the north-west using levees, channels and dams – is one of the last parts of the Murray-Darling Basin plan that needs to be implemented. While all stakeholders agree that licensing of the practice is needed so the water being taken can be controlled, measured and policed, there has been a bitter dispute between irrigators and the environmental movement over volumes to be licensed and the fact that the government intends to give the licences free to irrigators. Justin Field, the independent who moved the disallowance, said the NSW upper house had voted 18 to 15 to support his motion. “This vote recognises that the government hasn’t got the policy right when it comes to floodplain harvesting,” he said. “The government’s plan is a gift to a handful of large corporate irrigators, many of whom built dams far in excess of known caps. This is as much about equity for farming neighbours and other water licence holders as it is about downstream communities and the environment. “There is broad agreement that floodplain harvesting should be regulated, licensed and measured but the current rules leave downstream communities, other water license holders and the environment carrying the risk. That is not acceptable.” Cate Faehrmann, the Greens MP who chaired an upper house committee into the practice, said: “It should now be clear to the government that they do not have a social licence to gift $1 billion worth of water licences to their corporate irrigator mates.” The committee said more scientific work was needed and that any plan had to ensure flows in the lower part of the river system were maintained. “The government must bring floodplain harvesting to within the legal limits in the Murray-Darling basin plan,” she said. Faehrmann said that meant licensing 64GL of water take, not the 346GL that the government said it intends to license. “We will never support the expansion of floodplain harvesting beyond the legal limit of 64GL because it is ultimately unsustainable for the river system itself,” she said. Successive NSW water ministers have attempted to implement the regulations, only to have them disallowed by the upper house. On Monday, Anderson, who had produced regulations just before Christmas, went further than his predecessors, declaring flood plain harvesting a regulated water source and issuing volume determinations to irrigators. This was despite the upper house signalling it may again disallow the regulations at the first opportunity, which was this week. It is unclear what the legal impact of the minister’s actions will be. It could trigger compensation claims. Equally, by declaring flood plain harvesting a regulated water source under the Water Act, Anderson may also have made it illegal for irrigators to take the water without a licence. Until now irrigators were operating in a legal limbo and many continue to transfer overland flows from recent downpours into massive on-farm dams. Chris Gambian, the chief executive of the Nature Conservation Council, said this was the best decision possible for river health, First Nations peoples and downstream communities. “The new water minister, Kevin Anderson, now has an opportunity to sit down in good faith and understand the perspectives of the whole community on floodplain water harvesting. “We have to strike the right balance to ensure a viable agricultural sector all along the river system while keeping the river flowing and connected end to end. There’s no agriculture on a dead river system,” he said. The upper house called on the minister to engage in another round of consultations. Comment has been sought from the NSW Irrigators’ Council.",News/Australia news,NSW parliament rejects flood plain harvesting laws for third time over sustainability concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/nsw-parliament-rejects-flood-plain-harvesting-laws-for-third-time-over-sustainability-concerns
2/24/2022,"The QAnon conspiracy myth movement continues to thrive in the US and has even strengthened more than a year after Donald Trump left the White House, according to the largest ever study of its followers. Some 22% of Americans believe that a “storm” is coming, 18% think violence might be necessary to save the country and 16% hold that the government, media and financial worlds are controlled by Satan-worshipping pedophiles, according to four surveys carried out last year by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) think tank.  Each of these baseless and bizarre views is a core tenet of QAnon, an antisemitic internet conspiracy theory which held that Trump was waging a secret battle against a cabal of pedophiles and its “deep state” collaborators – a “storm” that would sweep them out of power. Yet despite his election defeat by Joe Biden, major social media platforms banning QAnon activity and the disappearance of its leader, “Q”, the movement has not gone away. If anything, it has strengthened. “The share of QAnon believers has increased slightly through 2021,” the report by the PRRI states. “In March, 14% of Americans were QAnon believers, compared to 16% in July, 17% in September, and 17% in October. “The share of QAnon doubters has remained relatively steady (46% in March, 49% in July, 48% in September, and 49% in October), while the share of QAnon rejecters has decreased slightly from 40% in March to 35% in July, 35% in September, and 34% in October.” These findings are based on 19,399 respondents from four surveys designed and conducted by the PRRI during 2021, using random samples of adults in all 50 states. Natalie Jackson, research lead, said: “People who are susceptible to believing in these conspiracy theories are found in every demographic. It’s not just restricted to Republicans or the uneducated or those who are in a specific age group. It’s distributed throughout. “Of course, there are some groups that are more prevalent than others, like there are many more Republicans than Democrats, but we do find that people in every demographic find these wild conspiracies believable.” Among the discernible patterns, about one in five QAnon believers identify as white evangelical Protestants, and QAnon believers are significantly less likely than all Americans to have college degrees. Media consumption is the strongest independent predictor of being a QAnon believer. Americans who most trust rightwing news outlets such as the One America News Network and Newsmax are nearly five times more likely than those who most trust mainstream news to be QAnon believers. Those who most trust Fox News are about twice as likely as those who trust mainstream news to be QAnon believers. They generally have positive views of the Republican party and negative views of Democrats, with 68% agreeing in the October survey that “the Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists”. Some 26% of QAnon believers have a favorable view of Biden while 69% have unfavorable views of him. About 63% have a favorable opinion of Trump but 31% have an unfavorable view of the former president who once claimed that QAnon followers “love our country” and “like me very much”. Seven in 10 QAnon believers agree with the false statement that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, including just under half who completely agree. These individuals are also most likely to blame leftwing groups such as antifa for the US Capitol insurrection on 6 January 2021 (there is no organized antifa organization). Jackson said: “These are people who believe that their culture is under attack, their way of life is under attack, so a lot of them do align with the Trump philosophies. According to those theories, Trump was supposed to be their leader. “One of the things that’s somewhat impressive is even with Trump out of power, and the fact that January 6 was not ‘the storm’ that they thought it might be, these beliefs have persisted.” Around eight in 10 QAnon believers agree with the statement that America is in danger of losing its culture and identity. More than seven in 10 say the values of Islam are at odds with American values and way of life, or that the American way of life needs to be protected from foreign influence. And 32% of QAnon believers agree with the statement that “the idea of America where most people are not white bothers me”. In late 2021, about one in 10 Americans (9%) agreed it might be necessary to commit an act of violence to save the country. QAnon believers (17%) and QAnon doubters (11%) were more likely than QAnon rejecters (4%) to share this view.",News/US news,"Belief in QAnon has strengthened in US since Trump was voted out, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/23/qanon-believers-increased-america-study-finds
2/24/2022,"Scott Morrison has played down the prospect of fighting “temporary” fuel price hikes with a cut in excise tax, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reignites concerns about Australia’s energy security. With petrol prices at the bowser already north of $1.80 and headed to $2.00, the expected invasion has added to global oil price pressures and led to concern for gas supplies to Europe – although experts say there is little Australia can do about either.  The government has come under pressure including from independent senator, Rex Patrick, to cut fuel excise, which is 44.2 cents a litre. Labor so far has attacked the government on fuel security but has not weighed in on tax. On Thursday Morrison acknowledged that Australia’s petrol prices are “very high” but explained there was a “a global issue with fuel prices”. “The advice we’re getting, particularly out of the [International Energy Agency], is that this impact is likely to be short term, it’s likely to be temporary,” he told ABC Radio. “You don’t go and completely recalibrate your budget based on fluctuations in oil prices. They’ve gone up, they’ve gone down. “The movement in oil prices quickly overwhelms any sort of movements [in tax]. So people make these points politically, but governments, I think, have to look at these things in a bigger context.” On Thursday the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said Australia stands “ready to take action to help alleviate these pressures” including through using its oil stocks held in the United States’ strategic petroleum reserve as part of a coordinated International Energy Agency (IEA) action to increase supply. In a statement, Taylor said Australia “cannot control international price spikes” but is “closely monitoring the situation with the IEA and the United States”. The Australian government has purchased just under 1.7m barrels of oil stored in the US reserve and entered deals to secure the longterm future of the only two remaining oil refineries in Australia: Viva refinery in Geelong and Ampol’s Lytton refinery in Brisbane. Under IEA rules, each country has an obligation to hold emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports as part of planning to avoid a hit from any major disruption to oil supplies. In December Australia still fell short of the requirement, with 67 days’ worth of petrol onshore, with a further 12 days’ worth on vessels coming to Australia and 10 days’ held offshore. Taylor said because of “strong international partnerships and diverse supply chains” he is “confident Australia is well supplied to keep us moving”. Labor’s Anthony Albanese said fuel prices had gone “through the roof” in part because “half of the refineries in Australia have shut down during this term of government”. Albanese said the government had “not met its obligations under the IEA for fuel reserves” and had bolstered stocks “in the Gulf of Mexico”. “Well, that’s useful, that is.” Albanese argued Australia’s fuel dependency would already be lower if the government had prioritised higher take-up of electric vehicles and hydrogen, which it had originally derided, claiming EVs would “end the weekend” and hydrogen was “snake oil”. Energy program director at The Australia Institute, Richie Merzian, said Australia is “incredibly liquid fuel insecure” with 90% of fuel imported from overseas, just two local refineries, and “no flag carrying oil tankers” outside those used by the navy. Head of energy at the Australian Industry Group, Tennant Reed, said Australia “may be bystanders to whatever transpires” because it would take “many years” to grow hydrogen production and reduce demand through more transport electrification. There is also “formally not a lot Australia can do” to help European supply of gas, Reed said. He noted Australia’s domestic gas security security mechanism could only be used if legislative or regulation change is made, and it “requires a determination far in advance”. “If the government swung into action now to make a decision, they could possibly limit some gas exports from next year.” Associate professor Liam Wagner said that the majority of Australia’s gas exports were “already contracted for delivery” to other markets, including Asia, South East Asia and Japan. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Wagner said the gas spot price is “reacting to fear” but there is “not much the Australian government can do”. On petrol excise, Wagner said it would be “unwise” to use it to tackle temporary price spikes and unlikely as it is a “considerable source of income to government”. “Our onshore resources make us continually vulnerable to international energy crises.” “We have far less than 90 days’ supply, and have done for 20 years. We’ve been very lucky not to have had shortages of supply.” National secretary of the Australian Workers Union, Daniel Walton, said the current crisis “highlights importance of maintaining fuel refining”, including ensuring that Australia’s two remaining refineries could convert Australian crude oil. While Australia should examine how gas exports could make up shortfall in markets such as Asia, Walton warned that supplying international markets should not be done “at the detriment of Australian manufacturers and users”. The Australian government revealed on Thursday that it would wait until the end of March to bring into force the sanctions that specifically curb trade with the two Ukrainian regions now recognised as independent by Vladimir Putin. Morrison said Australian businesses needed time to “make changes to their arrangements in an orderly way”. He acknowledged that Australia’s trade with Russia was “actually quite minor compared to many other countries” and said the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, had advised the national security committee that it could “impose these sanctions with minimal impact on Australian businesses”. The prime minister said while he did not expect the Australian sanctions to persuade Russia to cancel the invasion, there “must be consequences for violent, coercive and bullying behaviour.” He said the Australian government had “plenty left in the tank when it comes to further actions that we would take” if and when Russia escalated the violence.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison dismisses fuel excise cuts amid ‘temporary’ petrol price hikes ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/scott-morrison-dismisses-fuel-excise-cuts-amid-temporary-petrol-price-hikes
2/24/2022,"For many Russians, it was an unfamiliar sight to see the faces of the two leaders of the pro-Kremlin proxy states in eastern Ukraine pop up on their television screens last Friday, announcing the mass evacuation of Donbas citizens to Russia. Since then, however, Denis Pushilin and Leonid Pasechnik, heads of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, have seen their political profiles rocket, culminating on Monday with the two leaders asking the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to recognise their “republics”.  “This is their golden hour; they are quickly becoming stars,” said the political analyst Konstantin Skorkin, a Luhansk native who focuses on the region. Amid reports of Russian tanks rolling into the Donbas, questions have arisen as to what extent the separatists have been acting on their own accord or are just pawns in the Kremlin’s bigger geopolitical aims. “They are simply puppets of the Kremlin and the recent events only confirmed this once again,” said Skorkin. He points to how each statement that the two leaders made over the past week was quickly picked up by state media and the Kremlin. “The Russian leadership coordinated everything and nothing was left to chance,” the analyst said. The two regions have been highly dependent on Russian support since their formation in 2014 as they suffered economic collapse during their eight years of unrecognised independence. The regions’ People’s Militia is also fully armed by the Russian state, and Ukrainian officials believe up to 11,000 Russian soldiers are permanently stationed in the Donbas. “They just simply wouldn’t exist without Russian support,” said Nikolaus von Twickel, former OSCE staff member in Donetsk who has written extensively on the Donbas. “But their relationship with Moscow has changed over the years.” In the chaos that followed the 2014 Maidan revolution, a number of rogue and unpredictable local leaders emerged as heads of the two separatist states. Von Twickel said the Kremlin had since worked systematically to replace these firebrands with trusted loyalists. Analysts see 2018 as a turning point in the relative independence of the region, when Alexander Zakharchenko, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk people’s republic, was killed in a car bomb and replaced by the more reliable Pushilin. The Ukrainian security service said at the time Zakharchenko’s death was a result of an operation by Russian special forces. “Zacharchenko had his own personal army, and the Donbas even had its own defence ministry – all of that has disbanded since. It was a clear signal that the rebels will only act according to Kremlin’s rules,” Von Twickel said. And while experts now point to the very limited autonomy of Pushilin and Pasechnik, closely following the two leaders can serve as a good indication of what the Kremlin may do next in Ukraine. The younger and more charismatic of the two, not much is known about Pushilin’s early days in the Donbas. He first came to prominence in 2011, while working for the infamous MMM group, a notorious Russian Ponzi scheme that is considered to be one of the world’s largest fraud organisations of all time. “He is your typical wheeler-dealer kind of guy,” said Von Twickel. Pushilin joined the separatist cause early on in 2014, but in contrast to some of the other Donetsk leaders, he never saw any large military action, often sporting a suit in public, a habit he was occasionally mocked for by the other rebels. But over the years, Pushilin looked to have gained the Kremlin’s trust as he became the head of the region after the murky murder of Zakharchenko. Pushilin has repeatedly expressed his desire for the region to be part of a “renewed Russian empire” rather than an independent state. “Donbas should be part of the Russian empire. I don’t see anything bad in imperialism,” he once said. Prior to the 2014 Maidan revolution, Pasechnik had a long career in the Ukrainian security services, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He first received national attention in 2006 when in a special operation he intercepted 7.24m Russian roubles in cash (almost £2m) that was being smuggled across the Russian-Ukrainian border. Pasechnik reportedly refused to take a bribe from the smugglers in the operation, receiving a medal from the pro-western Ukrainian president, Viktor Yushchenko, for the operation. Like many other generals in the Ukrainian security services in the Donbas, Pasechnik chose the side of the pro-Russian separatists in 2014, when he headed the notorious state security department of the self-proclaimed Luhansk people’s republic. “He operated the main prisons and the so-called isolation cells, cellars where pretty sinister stuff happened,” said Von Twickel, referring to the many media reports depicting stories of torture of those who opposed the separatists. In 2017, Pasechnik emerged as the victor of a violent power struggle with the then head of Luhansk, Igor Plotnitsky. Not much has since been heard from the camera-shy and timid Pasechnik, and he has somewhat looked out of place as he was suddenly sprung into the country’s spotlight.",News/World news,‘Their golden hour’: Donetsk and Luhansk leaders revel in rising profile,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/denis-pushilin-leonid-pasechnik-donetsk-luhansk-ukraine-crisis
2/24/2022,"A group of shouting protesters have chased the New Zealand prime minister’s van down a driveway as she visited a Christchurch primary school, amid tensions over increasingly volatile anti-vaccine mandate protests. Jacinda Ardern, who was visiting a primary school in Christchurch, was met by a crowd of people shouting “shame on you” and “traitor”. Some held signs saying that the prime minister would be “put on trial” and “held responsible”, and one man brandished a fabricated arrest warrant – references to conspiracy theories that a cohort of world leaders and powerful people are secretly using vaccines to commit a genocide, and would soon be put on trial and hanged for treason.  Police officers formed a barrier to allow the prime minister to pass through. The Prime Minister was rushed away from an event at a school near Christchurch after a large group of protestors arrived.

The incident came as the country reported 6,137 new cases of Covid-19, almost a doubling from the previous record, set one day earlier. Anti-vaccine and anti-vaccine mandate protesters have been occupying New Zealand’s parliament grounds for more than two weeks and blocking a number of streets in Wellington’s central business district with their cars. The mood of the gatherings has darkened over time and rhetoric from some protesters has included violent threats against politicians, scientists and journalists. Two schools in the area have shut for the week, citing ongoing harassment of students for wearing masks. One protester was arrested this week after driving his car at a line of police officers, and police have also alleged that protesters threw faecal matter at officers. Last month, Ardern’s vehicle was chased and forced on to a curb by anti-vaccination protesters calling her a Nazi and yelling obscenities. Asked about the incident at the time, Ardern said it was “just another day”. “At no point was I worried about my safety or the safety of anyone that was with me,” she said. “Every day is faced with new and different experiences in this job … We are in an environment at the moment that does have an intensity to it that is unusual for New Zealand.
