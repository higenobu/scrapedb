4/16/2022,"A refugee who fled torture in Rwanda and was given asylum in the UK has criticised government plans to fly unauthorised migrants to his home country. The 42-year-old journalist told the Guardian that even though he has been granted refugee status here he remains in fear of being targeted by Rwandan government agents in the UK. The man, who lost many family members in the country’s 1994 genocide, decided to become a journalist after he left school in the country’s capital Kigali, because he had concerns about government corruption. He worked for a newspaper which was critical of President Kagame and his government, and was later shut down. He was accused of being an ‘enemy of the state’and was captured trying to flee across the border, blindfolded and tortured for four months. His torturers – who used electric shocks on him – tried to get him to reveal the names of his journalistic sources working for the government, but he refused. He eventually managed to escape to the UK, where he had a mental breakdown. He claimed asylum and after a long legal battle was granted refugee status, with the Home Office accepting his account of what happened to him. Government plans to send unauthorised asylum seekers on a one-way ticket to Rwanda have been roundly condemned as inhumane and unworkable. The prime minister on Thursday outlined the proposals to hand an initial down-payment of £120m to Kagame’s administration in the hope that it will accept “tens of thousands” of people. “I know of so many Rwandans who have fled the country,” he said. “Anyone who criticises Kagame, it is not good for them. Not so many Rwandans come to the UK but some escape to Germany, to Belgium or to Holland or to other African countries like Zambia and Mozambique.” “Rwanda is a good country for image, but not for freedom of speech. I’m really shocked that the offshoring to Rwanda is happening. It is like selling people. It’s really shameful for a country like the UK to be doing this. It’s like a business,” he said. “People will suffer there but it won’t stop the smuggling gangs. I believe asylum seekers will get bad treatment in Rwanda. I live outside London because the Rwandan embassy is in London and I don’t want to be near them. So many Rwandans who have left the country live in fear wherever they are.” He said he was scared of what would happen to him if he was ever sent back to Rwanda. “Those who oppose Kagame end up in prison. The Rwandan government use torture and violence against their opponents.”",News/UK news,Refugee who fled torture in Rwanda attacks UK asylum deal,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/16/refugee-who-fled-torture-in-rwanda-attacks-uk-asylum-deal
4/16/2022,"What were you hoping for?Honestly, to be proposed to. First impressions?Terror – she claimed we had matched on a dating app before. What did you talk about?We spoke about a range of topics, but I can say that Sienna is not as zealous about trying grilled human meat as I am. Any awkward moments?Sienna didn’t finish her croquette.

4/16/2022,"It is Saturday, and my wife and I are in a queue of cars trying to find spaces at the big B&Q. “Everybody’s had the same idea as us,” my wife says. “We had the idea before any of these people,” I say. Here is the idea: make a long list of everything that is broken, and then go out and get a bunch of stuff to fix it. We hatched this plan long before anybody else noticed it was sunny and decided to buy a pizza oven. “Should we go to the little B&Q instead?” she says. “No,” I say. “It must be the big one, for depth of choice.” Once inside, I find myself stranded in the shallows of choice. They have white grout, and clear grout, but no grey grout. I know there is such a thing as grey grout, because my shower is inexpertly grouted in it. The expansion bolt display has an empty hook where the size I want should be, but the shape of bracket I am looking for seems to exist only in my dreams. Eventually I find my wife in the outdoor section, pushing a flatbed trolley. “There’s some kind of grout shortage,” I say. “Did they have floor paint in the right colour?” “No,” she says. “Then why are we still here?” I say. “I’m buying plants,” she says. Exasperated, I wander up and down, looking at fountains and decorative gravel. On my third circuit something catches my eye: a fence post with a triangular profile, the last of its kind for sale. When I stand it on end, I discover that it’s well over two metres tall. “What’s that?” my wife says as I approach her, my new purchase banging against overhead signs. “Giant fence post,” I say. “Eight quid.” “What for?” she says. “To mend the thing,” I say. “The pergola?” she says. “Yes, that.” For complex reasons, I cannot say pergola. “How?” she says. “Once it’s cut to size,” I say. “I should be able to use this to brace the structure and stop it falling down.” “Is it strong enough?” she says. “Dunno,” I say. “Will it fit in the car?” she says. “These are all very good questions,” I say. It does fit in the car, just. When I get home I carry it through the house to the bottom of the garden, where the collapsing structure resides. The back end had been bolted to a brick wall, but the supporting batten had since rotted away, and as a result the right rear corner sags about a foot lower than the left. I jam the triangular end of the fence post under the low corner, lift it an inch and set the bottom end on the ground. The new bracing post sticks out at a sharp angle, but remains in place. I am calculating how much I will need to saw off when the youngest one appears in a T-shirt and bare feet. “That doesn’t look good,” he says. “Can’t you lift it any higher than that?” “It’s not that simple,” I say. The youngest one drags the garden table up to the wall and climbs on top. Crouching underneath the structure, he grabs two crosspieces and pushes upward. I move the post in, and the angle decreases slightly. “That’s a bit better,” I say. The boy, red in the face and still pushing, grunts something I cannot understand. “What?” I say. “Keep going!” he says. We proceed by degrees: he lifts, and I inch the bottom of the post a little further corner-ward. Finally, in what seems like a last bid to court disaster, I give the post a sharp and reckless kick. “Whoa,” says the youngest one. We both stare. A minute later I go inside to my wife. “The pergola is fixed,” I say. “Did you say pergola?” she says. “Yes, I’m cured,’ I say. “Come and see.” From a distance, the pergola now seems perfectly level – although it isn’t, quite – and from certain angles the triangular fence post appears to be square, matching the two front posts. The whole edifice has a distinct aura of intentionality. “No sawing, no nails,” I say. “Just immense structural pressures.” “Well done,” my wife says. “It’ll do until someone can fix it properly.” “You should know that I consider this to be a permanent solution,” I say. “When are you gonna do the grout?” she says.",Lifestyle/Life and style,I’m at the DIY store – surrounded by things I don’t want or need | Tim Dowling,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/16/tim-dowling-im-at-the-diy-store-surrounded-by-things-i-dont-need
4/16/2022,"Ifirst came across maqluba, or makloubeh, while watching a cooking demo by Franco-Palestinian chef Fadi Kattan for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, and was instantly hooked. As Kattan explains: “Maqluba is a one-pot meal that has a fantastic balance between protein, grains and vegetables.” It can also help you save waste, because you can upcycle leftover roast lamb (plus any bones) and vegetables from your Sunday roast into this lovely dish. For the best results, make your own stock from a lamb bone, either left over from a roast dinner or raw from the butchers. Pick off and save any meat before making the stock, then repeat after the stock is made, because more meat will reveal itself in the nooks and crannies after simmering for a couple of hours. Reserve all of these tasty morsels for the maqluba. If you don’t have much leftover lamb – you’ll need up to 250g for the recipe – the dish will still work well with as little as 150g: just replace the weight of any meat shortfall with more vegetables (leftover roast potatoes and carrots, say, both work well in the mix). Katten uses tomatoes in his maqluba, but they’re not currently in season in the UK, so I’m using tomato puree in the stock and piquillo peppers (or preserved peppers) in the base, to give the dish some colour, sweetness and acidity. Serve with yoghurt and flatbreads on the side. If you have any maqluba left over, Fadi says to reheat them in a saucepan with a little water until piping hot.

Remove the bone and pick off any remaining meat and set aside for for later, then remove and discard the bay leaves. Now prep all the other individual elements of the maqluba. Soak the rice in water. Cut the aubergine into thick slices and fry in a tablespoon of oil until golden. Cut the leftover potatoes into thick slices. Cut the pepper, if using, into slices. Now to build the maqluba. In a medium saucepan with a lid, cover the base with a mosaic of the sliced pepper, then top with, in turn, the potatoes, leftover roast lamb, chickpeas and fried aubergine. Drain the rice, then mix it with the remaining two tablespoons of olive oil, the spices and salt and pepper to taste. Tip into the pot and spread gently into an even layer, without pressing it down. Cover with the stock top up with cold water, if necessary), the pop on the lid and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to low and cook gently for 20 minutes, or until all the luqiud has been absorbed. Take off the heat and leave to rest for three minutes. Take off the lid, replace it with a large platter the flip over so the pot is now on top. Tap the base to release its contents, then and carefully lift the pot off the plate.
