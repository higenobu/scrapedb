2/7/2022,"On the ice, Britain’s mixed curlers endured their worst performance of these Beijing Games as they were thumped 6-2 by Norway in their penultimate group match. Off it, they discovered they had secured a place in the semi-finals on Monday despite this defeat. Funny old game, curling. Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds were about to hop on to a bus to the athletes’ village when news of their qualification filtered through. Their first reaction was to give each other a hug. The second was to remind themselves that their job is only half done.  So far they have played in fits and starts. They know that will no longer suffice in the business end of the tournament. “We’ve just had a hug,” Mouat said. “We are obviously very excited. We’ve still got a job to do tomorrow. Team GB have four potential semi-final opponents – Italy, Canada, Sweden or Norway – depending what happens in the final group games, but Dodds insisted they did not mind who was next. The key, she stressed, was finding the highest notes. “I think we still have a wee bit to go until we hit our best,” she said. “We have not yet strung eight ends together. We had a couple of good ends here or there or poor ends. We are pretty confident we will do that. The knockouts are a new competition.” Meanwhile, Australia’s curlers won two games back-to-back on Sunday – just a “crazy” few hours after being told they had to leave China due to a positive Covid test. With their bags packed after Tahli Gill returned a series of positive Covid-19 tests, she and her partner Dean Hewitt were given a dramatic reprieve. After racing to the venue, they went on to beat Switzerland 9-6 before toppling Canada 10-8 later on Sunday. “It has literally been the craziest, craziest 24 hours,” Gill said. “My bags are still packed, I only just had time to pull out my uniforms. I was ruffling through my bags and ripping clothes out left, right and centre. I played with only one glove on – and it was the wrong one.” The reprieve came after the Chinese public health system changed their minds after determining the CT values in her PCR tests fell into an acceptable range. Gill had been showing no symptoms and the Australian team said medical advice was that it was at the end of the infection cycle, which meant she was free to board a flight later on Sunday and would be permitted through customs in Australia. “It was really devastating given that I wasn’t infectious, but after review I’m so incredibly grateful to the medical team to get me out on the ice and I’m able to compete and finish off our campaign on a really positive note,” Gill said. “We put our hearts and souls into that game, to be able to come back with the win was really awesome.” Meanwhile Hewitt said the pair were readmitted to the competition just as they were preparing to leave for the airport. “We had a couple of phone calls that maybe there could be a chance. I was like, ‘Aw, don’t do this to us, please.’ Then we got the official call and we were like, ‘Are you serious?’ We had 15 minutes to get in the taxi. “It was just crazy, mayhem, getting the uniforms on. The excitement in the room was unbelievable. It was so exciting to be able to get back out on the ice and play these last two games. I’m just so proud of Tahli being able to step up in that game, because I don’t know how I would have been able to get through it myself.” Another Australian, Jakara Anthony, was also happy after winning a gold medal in the women’s moguls. But there was joy, too, for Britain’s Makayla Gerken Schofield, who finished in what she called a “mind-blowing” eighth place. “I’m still speechless,” Makayla said. “I can’t really believe it, I don’t know when it’s going to sink in but I think there’s going to be a lot of tears. I wasn’t expecting it to go this well. To say that I’m top eight at the Olympics, I think that is pretty special.” In the men’s 30km skiathlon, Andrew Musgrave could only finish 17th in a race won by the Russian Alexander Bolshunov. “It was ridiculous,” he said. “I wasn’t feeling too bad but in the classic section, Livo Niskanen and Bolshunov went so ridiculously fast that I had to push a bit too hard. “In altitude like this and on such abrasive snow, if you push a bit too hard, you’ve got no chance to recover. I didn’t feel too bad but it took me three laps to recover after going too fast in the classic section. I was so far behind.” Musgrave, who will next compete in the 15km Classic on Friday, also admitted: “It’s one of the slowest 30kms I’ve ever done. It felt horrifically hard but I just blew up after three laps there! It was a bit of a wild race.” He also praised the Russian gold medallist: “I wasn’t feeling too bad but the form Bolshunov is in at the moment is absolutely wild. We’re going to have to do something miraculous to beat him.” The final Team GB athlete in competition on Sunday, Rupert Staudinger, in the luge singles, finished 23rd overall. “It was good, I finished on a high,” he said. “I think today was my best run of the whole competition, so I’m really pleased with that.”",Sport/Sport,Britain’s mixed curlers secure semi-final spot despite defeat by Norway,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/britains-mixed-curlers-secure-semi-final-spot-despite-defeat-by-norway
2/7/2022,"Jürgen Klopp savoured the “proper fairytale” of Harvey Elliott’s Liverpool comeback as the teenager scored his first goal for the club, 21 weeks after suffering a dislocated ankle, in a 3-1 win against Cardiff. Elliott was taken off on a stretcher in Liverpool’s September win at Leeds, prompting fears for his future in an injury of such apparent severity that Klopp declared it was one of his worst moments in the game. But the winger scored a high-class goal, 18 minutes into his return, while the debutant Luis Díaz began his Liverpool career with an assist for Takumi Minamino’s strike.  “Coming on is a great step back, scoring the goal makes it a proper fairytale,” Klopp said. “Harvey Elliott’s goal was very touching. I have known him for a while now, I know what an incredible talent he is and an incredible kid he is. When we lost him at Leeds, it was one of the hardest moments of my career.” Klopp praised Elliott, 18, for the attitude he has shown during his comeback, adding: “There are so many things to do in this long period, you can do a lot of wrong things and luckily he did a lot right. He is still a fearless boy and a great footballer. When you are that young you deal with it better. Even on the first day, he was pretty much on the way back. “Probably his biggest talent is how ready he is mentally for all the things out there. He is a kid but on the pitch not so much. He was buzzing and waiting for this moment. When he got the injury, I saw him two days later at the training ground and I was in a worse mood than he was. He was saying, ‘Come on, boss, head up.’ He is an exceptional talent in a lot of departments.” Elliott paid particular tribute to Liverpool’s rehab physio. “The list goes on but one man most important is Joe Lewis, one of the physios,” he said. “He took me in the early hours until late at night and got me strong again.”",Sport/Football,Klopp hails ‘proper fairytale’ of Harvey Elliott’s comeback goal for Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/klopp-hails-proper-fairytale-of-harvey-elliotts-comeback-goal-for-liverpool

Akash, a wannabe R&B songwriter and heavy drinker, is plagued by shame for being gay, while Renu guiltily searches for her first love after her husband’s death. What this poignant tale lacks in finesse, it makes up for with soulful and convincing Indian-American characters . Osman YousefzadaCanongate, £14.99, pp368 Yousefzada’s journey from son of illiterate immigrant parents to artist and world-famous fashion designer is fascinating in itself. But in concentrating on his early years, he explores something more profound and universal: the search for identity. With a documentarian’s eye, he picks apart life in his devout Pashtun patriarchal community in 1980s Birmingham, taking on racism, gender roles, women’s rights, honour-based violence and so much more. The result is a remarkable insight into multicultural Britain and the pain inherent in following your own path. Julia BlackburnVintage, £14.99, pp304 (paperback) This moving exploration of the huge landmass that once connected the east coast of England to Europe rightly won Blackburn awards nominations a few years ago.

2/7/2022,"Thirty-odd years ago everyone was too busy listening to Vivaldi’s concertos to bother about his 90 or so operas. Two decades ago the operas began to appear in earnest on disc; now, with audiences ready to look beyond Handel for a baroque opera fix, they are reaching the stage. Bajazet is the first Vivaldi opera to be staged under the Royal Opera House’s roof, and if anyone needs persuading that this is a good idea then Adele Thomas’s production, a collaboration with Irish National Opera that has already toured Ireland for two weeks, should do the trick. Thomas adds a bit of helpful context with an opening monologue giving the story so far, introducing the title character as “the Thunderbolt of Allah” and his captor, Tamerlano, is a warlord descended from Genghis Khan. The ensuing story mainly milks the baroque opera tropes of love, betrayal and disguise, but it’s a credit to Thomas’s insightful direction and to the six-strong cast that we remain invested in it, rooting for Gianluca Margheri’s noble-sounding Bajazet and wondering what James Laing’s thuggish, volatile Tamerlano will do next.  Molly O’Cathain’s set is basically a box made from slabs of glowing sandstone, and it loves the voices, especially that of the sweet-toned countertenor Eric Jurenas as the hapless go-between Andronico. The vocal highlight comes with the arrival of Claire Booth as the jilted Irene, brilliantly flinging off relentless cascades of notes in her first aria. This, in fact, isn’t by Vivaldi, but is one of several arias cherry-picked from other composers’ work, as was normal practice for time-pressed composers of this period; it is by Riccardo Broschi, who originally wrote it as a showpiece for his superstar brother Farinelli. Vivaldi kept the good characters for himself, though, and a contrasting highlight from his own pen is the aria for Bajazet’s daughter Asteria in which Niamh O’Sullivan’s velvety mezzo-soprano is doubled by a grainy solo violin; accompanied only by cello and theorbo, it’s a touching moment of quiet. Otherwise the orchestra, at floor level rather than in a pit, is strongly present. In recitatives, when Peter Whelan’s insistent harpsichord makes things rather opaque, it’s sometimes too present; in arias, when Whelan’s direction keeps energy levels strong and the phrasing purposeful, it’s just right.

2/7/2022,"Honeysuckle and Rachael Blackmore extended their unbeaten record to 14 races with an effortless success at odds of 1-5 in the Irish Champion Hurdle on Sunday. Henry de Bromhead’s mare eased into the lead around the home turn and quickly went clear of her four rivals before crossing the line six-and-a-half lengths in front of Zanahiyr. She will now head to the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham on 15 March as the odds-on favourite to defend the crown she won 12 months ago.  Earlier on the card, two more major hopes for the Festival from the Willie Mullins yard completed their preparations in impressive fashion, with Chacun Pour Soi and Galopin Des Champs running out easy winners by 12 and nine lengths, respectively. Chacun Pour Soi will now join his stable companion, Energumene, in the field for the Queen Mother Champion Chase on 16 March, the only Grade One race at the Cheltenham Festival that Mullins has yet to win. Shishkin, who beat Energumene in the Clarence House Chase at Ascot last month, is 8-11 favourite to confirm the form next month, with Energumene on 3-1 and Chacun Pour Soi, beaten at odds-on in last year’s renewal, now 6-1 (from 8-1).",Sport/Sport,Honeysuckle proves a class apart in Irish Champion Hurdle triumph,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/honeysuckle-proves-a-class-apart-in-irish-champion-hurdle-triumph
2/7/2022,"On the eve of the Winter Olympics, China promised the world a “streamlined, safe and most splendid” Games. But just two days into the event organisers are facing a litany of complaints from athletes and countries on multiple fronts. The Swedes have suggested that the conditions in the mountains are perilously cold. A Polish skater says she was living in fear in a Beijing isolation ward and has “cried until I have no more tears”. The Finns have claimed an ice hockey player is being kept in Covid quarantine for no reason. And the Germans? They are frustrated that there is no hot food at the downhill skiing.  Athletes were always going to face difficulties in Beijing, given they are in a “closed loop” system that forbids them from leaving the village except to train, compete or go home. However, a growing number are now expressing frustration and anguish with other aspects of their Winter Olympic experience. Plummeting temperatures are usually a given at the Games, but the Swedish delegation are urging cross-country skiing events to be held earlier in the day after one athlete, Frida Karlsson, was seen shaking and close to collapse at the end of the women’s 7.5km+7.5km skiathlon. Under the rules of the International Ski Federation (FIS), competitions are stopped from taking place when temperatures are below -20c. When Karlsson competed on Saturday, temperatures at the National Cross-Country Centre in the mountains of Zhangjiakou, 130 miles north-west of Beijing, were -13C – but with windchill it was far colder. “We have the cold limits but I do not know if they also measure the wind effect,” the Swedish team boss Anders Bystroem told reporters. “If FIS says it’s -17 degrees and it’s windy, and it’s -35 degrees with the wind chill, what do you do then?” The Swede called for Tuesday’s women’s sprint race to be moved earlier in the day because of the freezing temperatures. “The skiathlon started at 4pm and Frida Karlsson was completely destroyed by the cold. It’s not good that the sprint starts even later,” he added. Meanwhile the Polish speed skater Natalia Maliszewska, who was forced to miss the 500m short track event on Saturday, revealed that she had faced fear and uncertainty in a Beijing isolation ward after testing positive for Covid. “Since a week I have been living in fear and these changes in mood,” she said. “I cry until I have no more tears and make not only the people around me worry but myself too,” she said. Those in an isolation ward are allowed out if they are free of symptoms and have two negative Covid tests 24 hours apart and Maliszewska was eventually released back to the Olympic village – before being told there had been a mistake. “People got me out of my room at 3am,” she said. “This night was a horror, I slept in my clothes in my bed because I was afraid that at any moment someone would take me back to isolation. Then a message that unfortunately they were mistaken, that I am a threat, and should not have been released from isolation. “I have to get back to the Olympic Village as soon as possible,” she added. “I can’t understand this anymore. I no longer believe in any tests, any Olympics. To me this is a big joke, I hope whoever is managing this has a lot of fun. My heart and my mind can’t take this anymore.” More than 350 Games participants, including dozens of athletes, have tested positive upon arrival in the Chinese capital since 23 January. Many are still in isolation, fearing their Games are over. One of those is the Finnish ice hockey player Marko Anttila, whose team believes he is being kept in Covid-19 isolation for no reason. “From a medical perspective we know that a person like this is no longer infectious, no danger to the other team,” Finnish doctor Maarit Valtonen said. “These isolation decisions are not based on medicine or science, it’s more cultural and political decisions.” The Finland head coach Jukka Jalonen said that the situation was affecting Anttila’s mental health. “We know that he’s fully healthy and that’s why we think that China, for some reason, won’t respect his human rights and that’s not a great situation,” he added. The Russian biathlon competitor Valeria Vasnetsova also recently expressed her experiences of being in a quarantine hotel, posting on Instagram: “My stomach hurts, I’m very pale and I have huge black circles around my eyes. I want all this to end. I cry every day. I’m very tired.” Vasnetsova posted a picture of what she said was “breakfast, lunch and dinner for five days already” – a tray with food including plain pasta, an orange sauce, a piece of meat on a bone, a few potatoes and no greens. Meanwhile, after the men’s downhill was postponed until Monday due to high winds, Germany’s coach Christian Schwaiger lamented there was no hot food available for athletes. “The catering is extremely questionable, because really it’s not catering at all,” he said. “I would have expected that the Olympic Committee is capable of providing hot meals. There are crisps, some nuts and chocolate and nothing else.” The IOC said it was aware of the complaint and was working with Beijing 2022 to address the issues. Asked about the situation in the Covid hotels, the IOC added: “We feel for every athlete who cannot compete because of a Covid-19 infection. The protocols have been put in place to ensure safe Olympic Games for everyone.”",Sport/Sport,‘I have no more tears’: Beijing’s Winter Olympics hit by athlete complaints,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/i-have-no-more-tears-beijing-winter-olympics-hit-by-athlete-complaints
2/7/2022,"A prominent journalist has been arrested under terrorism and sedition laws, as a crackdown on the press in Indian-administered Kashmir continues to escalate. Fahad Shah, the founder and editor of the widely read local news website The Kashmir Walla, was arrested on Friday evening when he was summoned to a police station in the southern district of Pulwama.  Shah, 33, who has reported about Kashmir for several international publications including the Guardian, had built his blog into a formidable news website. Despite mounting pressure and threats, he and his team of reporters had continued to cover alleged human rights abuses carried out by the military in the region. Kashmir’s police chief, Insp Gen Vijay Kumar, told reporters that Shah “has been arrested on the basis of one of the three FIRs [first information reports] lodged against him for frequently glorifying terrorism, spreading fake news, and instigating people, for the past three to four years”. Police detained Shah under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), an anti-terrorism law which authorities are frequently accused of misusing, and under the archaic sedition law, in connection with his website’s report of a gunfight between the military and alleged militants in Pulwama. The report had included allegations by the family that the “militant” slain by the Indian military was an innocent civilian. He has been placed in 10-day police custody, according to a statement issued by his website. Under the UAPA, police have the right to detain Shah for up to six months without charges and it is notoriously difficult to get bail under the law. “If convicted, he faces life imprisonment,” the Kashmir Walla statement said. Shah’s lawyer, Umair Ronga, who filed a bail application on his behalf, called the arrest under terrorism laws “shocking” and “the end of the rule of law” in Kashmir. “He is a decorated journalist and a firm believer of the majesty of the law. His arrest is unwarranted,” said Ronga on Twitter. Shah’s arrest comes in the wake of an aggressive crackdown on independent journalists in Kashmir, which is disputed between India and Pakistan and home to a long-running violent militant insurgency. Last month, Sajad Gul, a journalist who had contributed to The Kashmir Walla, was detained under the Public Safety Act, another anti-terror law, and still remains in jail. Other journalists have faced raids and interrogations for their reporting and social media posts or been placed on no-fly lists. The Kashmir Press Club, which had been a home for independent journalists in the region for decades, was also unilaterally shut down last month after a “coup” by reportedly pro-government journalists, escorted by armed police. Speaking to the Guardian in the aftermath of the closure, before his arrest, Shah said that “journalism is being choked in the region.” Shah’s arrest was said to mark a new low in press freedom in Kashmir, which has been subjected to a withering crackdown on civil rights in the last three years, after prime minister Narendra Modi’s government took away Kashmir’s autonomy and brought it fully under central government control. The Editors Guild of India called for the “immediate release” of Shah and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a strongly worded statement.“The arrest of Fahad Shah shows Jammu and Kashmir authorities’ utter disregard for press freedom and the fundamental right of journalists to report freely and safely,” said Steven Butler, the CPJ’s Asia coordinator in Washington.",News/World news,Editor arrested in Kashmir as press crackdown escalates ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/editor-arrested-in-kashmir-as-press-crackdown-escalates
2/7/2022,"Whichever angle viewed from, this Ireland team are starting to look very impressive. And, boy, do they do angles. The sheer number by which Irish runners came at Wales had the latter’s defence more than a little stressed throughout. Four tries ensued in a comfortable-sounding 29-7 win, but really the cold stats hardly do justice to the nature of this dismantling. That is nine wins in a row now for Ireland since they underwhelmed in their opening two fixtures of the championship this time a year ago. When the world rankings are refreshed on Monday, they will leapfrog England into third to become the highest placed of the Six Nations. But they remain second favourites to France (world No 5), who will host them in Paris on Saturday.  The stage is set for the next Big Match, beyond which none of the contestants will be looking, but the rest of us can speculate to our hearts’ content. Needless to say, if Ireland play like this in Paris there is every chance they put the championship to bed, what with a home fixture against Italy in round three. All Ireland’s usual suspects strutted their stuff on the stage at the weekend but, as gratifying as any of the performances by Josh van der Flier, the two props, Garry Ringrose and the like was that of the new boy on the wing. Mack Hansen was making his debut and took his cue almost immediately, the key contributor in the build-up to Ireland’s first try in the third minute. His award of man of the match might have gone to any number of players but it clinched a performance that would qualify as fairy tale, Hansen having arrived from his native Australia only a few months ago to play for Connacht. “I’m just still in shock about everything,” he said, “and I’m just trying to take it all in.” People still get very touchy about the nationality question, which is futile in this multicultural, migratory world in which we live. Hansen’s mum is Irish, so he qualifies. Simple as that. He has extended family in Cork. “To play for such a great rugby nation was definitely an aspiration of mine,” he said. “I consider this place home now, and I think I will for a long time. So to get my first cap for Ireland is something I’ll remember for ever.” His Connacht teammate Bundee Aki got the first try. Andrew Conway (twice) and Ringrose then scored in the third quarter to register the bonus point and a 29-0 lead on the hour, which was in no way flattering to the Irish. Wales did moderately well to restrict them to just that, particularly in the first, when the score stood at 10-0, but that is faint praise indeed. Just about the only plus for them was the performance of Taine Basham. He was top of Wales’s counts for carries, metres and tackles. He was their top scorer, too. His intercept try five minutes from the end certainly did flatter Wales, if not Basham himself. Next up for them are a buoyant Scotland in Cardiff. The champions did not want to find themselves firefighting as early as this.",Sport/Sport,Ireland forge Six Nations title path with Wales dispatched and France waiting,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/ireland-forge-six-nations-title-path-with-wales-dispatched-and-france-waiting
