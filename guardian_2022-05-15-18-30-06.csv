5/15/2022,"If the 2022 contest is between a bulldozer and a builder, it makes sense that the final act of the election be staged on a residential housing construction site. Back when Scott Morrison was being written off erroneously as a dead prime minister walking at the same point of the campaign in 2019, he used the official launch to unveil a new homeowner deposit scheme to help first-home buying couples get “their first leg on the first rung of the ladder”. Learning from that, Anthony Albanese focused on housing this time, using his campaign launch a couple of weeks ago to unveil a shared equity scheme for homeownership modelled on initiatives in some states. The new Labor scheme would build on Morrison’s scheme from 2019. As his final throw of the dice in this election, Morrison tracked back to homeownership, dusting off a well-ventilated but previously perpetually stalled proposal for people to use their superannuation to help with the purchase of their first home. Just for the record, Malcolm Turnbull once blasted this concept as “thoroughly bad” and “the craziest idea I’ve heard” and no less an eminence than Mathias Cormann noted several years ago this would “increase demand for housing and … would actually drive up house prices by more”. But here we are. Morrison has whipped this out, not because it is good policy (although I suspect the “it’s your money” marketing pitch is simple enough to resonate with Australians who are only half listening) – but because he wants a fight, a politically productive one that might move soft votes into the Liberal column at the decisive point. Morrison lost the key definitional fight of last week – the one about wages. Advocating a real wage cut for Australia’s lowest paid workers wasn’t exactly an election-winning line. So as the prelude to Sunday’s super shazam, Morrison moved to change the conversation. On Friday, the devil you know casually rebranded himself Morrison 2.0. The prime minister told voters I know a good number of you dislike me, but the pandemic made me look stubborn and impatient when I’m actually cuddly and task oriented, and if you give me another three years I promise I’ll infuriate you less. While Morrison set about proving once again he is prepared to do whatever it takes to win, Peter Dutton suddenly disclosed the presence of a Chinese surveillance ship off the coastline just in case anyone planning to vote over the next few days was interested in that information. Sunday was the next instalment of the Coalition’s soft vote courtship. The Liberals certainly know how to craft cut-through messages and they run a formidable campaign machine, so the atmospherics of Sunday were as slick as you might expect. Incumbency is the structural advantage Morrison possesses and he used it. In terms of narrative, Morrison used his official campaign launch to remind Australians they liked him once – back during the opening 12 months of the pandemic, when the official objective was building the “bridge” to the other side of the crisis. The bridge was back in force on Sunday; a totem of beneficent incumbency. Then Morrison moved to pick his fight with Labor about people using their superannuation savings to help fund a first home, while also widening access to super tax concessions for any asset rich older Australians currently contemplating downsizing. Labor, trying to remain aerodynamic seven days from polling day, could cop the second of these ideas, but not the first. Paul Keating was out of the blocks within the hour, monstering Morrison’s plan. The shadow housing minister, Jason Clare, said using super savings for home purchasing would be yet another demand-side stimulus when the main problem fuelling the lack of affordability was a lack of housing supply. He noted stimulating demand further would only accelerate house price inflation. Clare also pointed out that the cohort of Australians currently priced out of the housing market didn’t have super balances substantial enough to put together a deposit. Now the truth is neither side of politics is proffering a serious solution to Australia’s housing affordability problem at this election. A serious solution would involve two things – a substantial supply side intervention, and adjusting the tax concessions that benefit investors and allow them to outbid would-be owner-occupiers. Labor tried on the tax concessions back in 2019, and voters thumped them. Notwithstanding the problem that voters resoundingly rejected at the last election one of the solutions that might actually make a substantive difference, substantive solutions to this problem are what Australians actually need. Rather than endlessly supercharging demand while nibbling delicately at supply, voters need Australia’s political class to engage in serious policy thought about how to balance the interests of the current rights holders, Australia’s property owners, with the rights of others to afford the security and dignity of a roof over their heads. Last week I listened to a story on the ABC’s AM program about families in Bundaberg – families with decent jobs – having to live in tents and cars because there’s no affordable housing stock available to them. This doesn’t really sound like an Australia I want to live in, an Australia where I have a roof over my head for no reason other than I was able to buy my first home in the mid-1990s. I have a safe place to live that I can call my own, but a lot of other people who work hard and have kids to feed and educate and keep safe are contemplating pitching a tent for shelter. But, hey guys, Morrison has his election fight. Aren’t we all lucky? Aren’t we lucky that’s the priority: what’s needed to get the Coalition campaign closer to victory over this coming week. Morrison told voters on Sunday he was seeking a second term because he was “just warming up”. Actually, if Morrison wins this coming Saturday (and it’s entirely possible he will) it will be the Coalition’s fourth term, not its second – and after three terms in office, the country is standing still on most of the problems that Australia faced back at the time Tony Abbott took office. There’s a reason why that’s happened. The reason is political product differential too often becomes the priority rather than the pursuit of policy substance in the national interest.",News/Australia news,"Super for houses is a bad idea, but Scott Morrison wants to pick a fight over it | Katharine Murphy",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/15/super-for-houses-is-a-bad-policy-but-scott-morrison-wants-to-pick-a-fight-over-it
5/15/2022,"Ten days before she was assassinated outside a Mexican convenience store, Yesenia Mollinedo noticed two mysterious stalkers following her on a motorbike. “We know where you live, bitch,” one of them warned the journalist, the director of an online news outlet called El Veraz (The Truthful One) whose motto is “Journalism with Humanity”. For more than a year, Mollinedo, 45, had been trying to shrug off what she hoped were empty threats designed to silence the stories she published about crime in the coastal town of Cosoleacaque. She repeatedly changed her phone number in an attempt to escape the intimidation. “I don’t think anything will happen to me,” Mollinedo insisted when relatives asked about her safety. But at about 1.15pm last Monday it did. As the journalist stepped out of the shop with a rookie colleague, the assassins pounced, firing 16 shots that would end the lives of both women. “Yesenia didn’t owe anything to anyone,” her brother, a fellow journalist called Ramiro Mollinedo, said this week as overwhelmed family members laid her to rest and fretted over their own safety now his sister was gone. “We don’t know who we are up against,” he admitted. Mollinedo and Sheila Johana García were the first of four female journalists to lose their lives in the line of duty last week, a spasm of butchery that has shocked the world. Two days later, the Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh, a veteran observer of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was shot in the face while covering an anticipated Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank. The next day, a 29-year-old Chilean journalist, Francisca Sandoval, died after being shot in the head while covering May Day protests at the start of the month. “Francisca was the most wonderful mother and daughter,” remembered Gabriel Cardozo, a photographer at Señal 3 de La Victoria, the channel where Sandoval had worked. “She was one of those people who would always be looking out for you … How can you express your pain at losing someone with whom you’ve been through so much?” The deaths of so many journalists in such a short space of time have sparked an international outcry and soul-searching in newsrooms from Mexico City to Doha. “All we wanted to do was our job,” said Shatha Hanayshe, a Palestinian journalist who was standing next to the respected Al Jazeera reporter when she was gunned down trying to document the Israeli operation in Jenin. “This will stay with me for the rest of my life,” added the 26-year-old journalist who appears frozen to the spot next to her colleague’s corpse in chilling footage showing the aftermath of that shooting. “There is no need to target us.” Robert Mahoney, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said each of the shootings was particular and had taken place in different circumstances: “But there is a common thread here, which is that in 2022 we have seen a real upsurge in the numbers of journalists being killed. “It is very difficult to draw a direct connection between any of these killings except to say that it has become – and is becoming, I believe – more dangerous to do independent journalism,” Mahoney added. Part of the increase in bloodshed is the result of the outbreak of war in Ukraine, where at least seven journalists have died since Vladimir Putin’s invasion on 24 February. Thousands of civilians are also thought to have lost their lives. The stunning surge in killings in Mexico, where local campaigners say 11 journalists have been assassinated since January compared with seven last year, had also contributed to the global rise. “It’s censorship through the gun,” Mahoney said of the wave of organized crime-related killings in the Latin American country whose media-bashing president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has been accused of encouraging the violence with his populist rhetoric. “[It’s] killing people in order to send a message … [and] bring about that real cancer on journalism which is self-censorship: when journalists just stop or comply because it is just too dangerous to do otherwise.” Yet campaigners say the killings are only the most dramatic expression of an increasingly gloomy outlook for media freedom in an ever-more authoritarian world. The Chinese city of Hong Kong – home until recently to a feisty independent journalism scene – has been transformed in just a few years since Beijing’s imposition of a draconian national security law. “There is a now a palpable sense that the fight for democracy and media freedom has entered its endgame,” the International Federation for Journalists warned of China’s crackdown earlier this year, describing how many media workers had been jailed or fled the former colony in recent months. Russian journalists faced a clampdown even before this year’s invasion of Ukraine, while reporters in Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries – and even democracies such as Viktor Orbán’s Hungary and Jair Bolsonaro’s Brazil – are coming under growing pressure from governments who consider them an irritant. Mahoney said his group was also concerned about the growing online harassment and intimidation of journalists, particularly female ones, around the globe. “Whether it’s in the Philippines or in India, more and more journalists are attacked online and these online attacks can sometimes be a harbinger of a physical attack,” he warned, urging social media companies to take action. The CPJ president, Jodie Ginsberg, said covering protests – as Francisca Sandoval lost her life doing in Chile – had also become increasingly dangerous for journalists. “Journalists are not being killed in the crossfire any longer: increasingly, they are being targeted,” Ginsberg added. “In the case of Shireen Abu Akleh, eyewitnesses say Israeli forces shot and killed her while she was reporting and clearly identified as ‘press’ and this follows a worrying pattern of Israeli forces targeting Palestinian journalists.” The first hints of the danger Mollinedo was facing in Mexico began about 18 months ago, when her crime coverage began attracting a growing number of threats. “Take the fucking story down or we will fuck you up,” they warned, according to her brother who said she had deleted a series of stories in an effort to avoid trouble. The identity of Mollinedo’s killers is a mystery, and is likely to remain so. Activists say more than 150 Mexican journalists have been murdered since the turn of the century with more than 90% going unsolved and unpunished. Valério Luiz Filho, a Brazilian lawyer whose journalist father was assassinated nearly 10 years ago as he left the radio station where he worked, said the influential perpetrators of such crimes had to be held responsible if anything was to change. Ten years after he found his father’s lifeless body in a bullet-riddled car in the city of Goiânia, the five suspected killers – who include one powerful local figure – have yet to be sentenced or jailed. “Justice means showing these people that the thing they took away has value. It means making them understand the value of the thing they exterminated,” Luiz said. “There has to be justice in these cases, whether it’s in Chile or Mexico or wherever … [so people understand] that the journalists whose lives were stolen are valuable and that their work is valuable too. “Only justice will send this kind of message,” Luiz said, as thousands of mourners bade farewell to Shireen Abu Aklen more than 10,000km away in Jerusalem.",News/Media,"From Mexico to Palestine, journalists in the crosshairs of deadly onslaught",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/15/journalist-killings-mexico-palestine-chile-ukraine
5/15/2022,"At the Liberal party launch on Sunday, Scott Morrison basically declared that Australia has had the best Covid recovery in the world. He said: Our economic growth was higher than any other advanced economy, our AAA credit rating is intact, one of only nine countries to do that in the world … On almost every measure, growth, jobs, debt levels, fatality rates, vaccine rates, Australia’s recovery is leading the advanced world. But is Australia’s record as unimpeachable as that? And which countries are we referring to when we say the response is world-beating? If the standard of “advanced economies” is G7 nations, then Morrison’s boast is correct, but if the standard is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, it is not. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australia’s economy at the end of 2021 was 3.4% bigger than it was at the start of the pandemic (December quarter, 2019). According to the OECD, that beats G7 nations over that period, although the US is a close second (3.1%), and France (0.9%) and Canada (0.2%) were also positive. In the G20, however, Australia’s performance lags Turkey (14.5%), China (10.2%), India (5.4%) – although these are developing economies, which in turn dragged the G20 average higher than Australia’s result (4.1%). Broadening out further, there were some developed countries in the OECD that performed even better. Australia’s GDP shrank 2.2% in 2020 then grew by 4.7% in 2021. That performance was bettered by Denmark (-2.1% then up 4.7%), Israel (-2.1% then up 7.9%), Ireland (up 5.9% then up 13.5%), New Zealand (-2.1% then up 5.6%), Norway (-0.7% then up 3.9%). Still, Australia had a better fourth quarter of 2021 than all these nations, except Israel. According to the OECD, Australia’s March 2022 unemployment rate of 3.954% is higher than the Czech Republic (2.3%), Germany (2.9%), Hungary (3.2%), Israel (3.8%), Japan (2.6%), Korea (2.7%), Mexico and the Netherlands (3.3%) and the US (3.6%). So, let’s just say this is one of the stats Morrison excluded with that all-important caveat, that Australia wins on “almost every measure”. Australia’s government debt, 84.38% of GDP, is lower than the OECD average of 94.3% but higher than 24 other OECD countries. These include Germany (78.66%), Israel (73.16%), Sweden (59.73%), Korea (58.77%) and New Zealand (55.33%). Australia has now had a total of 7,794 Covid deaths: 2,239 over 2020 and 2021 and 5,555 in 2022 so far. In a November 2021 paper on excess mortality since January 2020, Australia beat almost all OECD countries, except Denmark, Iceland, Korea and Norway. According to the World Health Organisation’s Covid-19 dashboard, Australia reported 246 Covid deaths in the last seven days, more than several countries with larger populations including Germany (220), South Africa (159), and Spain (94). The United Kingdom reported 377 deaths in the last week, despite having a population of 67m, more than double Australia’s (25.7m). While Australia’s death rate was relatively low in the first two years of the pandemic, the health response is no longer world-beating. According to the WHO, Australia sits near the top of countries ranked by total vaccine doses per 100 people, with 227 jabs per 100 people. Australia is nevertheless behind: New Zealand (229), China (231), Singapore (239), Korea (244), and some countries with much smaller populations. Australia is also doing better on the measure of primary vaccine doses than on number of people who have received their booster. By the measure of people boosted, much of Europe – including Italy, Germany, France and Greece – is beating Australia. On most measures, Australia’s economic and health response to Covid-19 has been better than other comparable nations over the first two years. But Australia’s world-beating health response is now a thing of the past. After Australia ended its strict caps on international arrivals and other domestic health restrictions, fatalities have increased despite high vaccination rates. On the economic measure elevated by Morrison, growth, his claim is true in comparison to the G7 but not the OECD.",News/World news,Factcheck: Scott Morrison says Australia is a world leader in Covid recovery.

5/15/2022,"It has become a fashionable feminist slogan that is printed on everything from T-shirts and badges to fridge magnets and mugs: “Courage calls to courage everywhere”. On her statue in Parliament Square, the suffragist leader Millicent Fawcett even proudly displays her famous quotation on a stone banner. But a new book suggests that Fawcett’s words have been taken out of context and that she was not making the rallying cry for feminism and suffrage that many people have thought. “We have taken a quote where Fawcett’s making a statement and we’ve turned it into this feminist go-getting slogan,” said Edinburgh University professor Melissa Terras, editor of a forthcoming book, Millicent Garrett Fawcett: Selected Writings. “Courage calls to courage everywhere, and its voice cannot be denied” is often cited as a quote from a speech Fawcett made in 1913 about Emily Davison, the suffragette who died after she ran on to Epsom racecourse and was trampled by King George V’s horse. In fact, Fawcett – who did not approve of the suffragettes’ militant tactics to get the vote – never made any such speech, claimed Terras. It was not until after some women had the vote, in 1920, that she finally penned her famous line about the contagious impact of the suffragette’s courage. At that point, Fawcett was merely trying to explain why Davison’s death – which she described as a deliberately “sensational” act of self-sacrifice – made headlines around the world, argues Terras. “She thought that Davison’s death was pointless,” said Terras, who co-edited the book with suffrage historian Elizabeth Crawford. “She sees it as a senseless loss of life.” In 1913, Fawcett ran a tersely worded editorial in her weekly newspaper, the Common Cause, stating that, for all who believed in the enfranchisement of women, Davison’s death was a “piteous waste of courage and devotion” that did not deserve the name of “heroism”. She made no other attempt to publicly mourn or comment on Davison’s death at the time, the new book will show. Terras thinks it is extremely unlikely that when Fawcett wrote her now famous quotation in a book, seven years after Davison’s death, she had decided to rally other women to stand up and fight for their rights as Davison did. Instead, she suggests that Fawcett, a patriotic pro-war imperialist, was making a connection between Davison’s “self-sacrifice” for the cause of “freedom” and the deaths of so many men during the first world war. Terras said: “In the context of 1920, when lots of young people had just lost their lives, she writes that giving up your life for something you believe in is courageous.” She may also have been making a call for unity, said the social historian Jane Robinson, who specialises in women’s history. “For many years, the fight for the vote had been divided, and now here was a chance, after the war and ahead of universal suffrage, to bring healing. Hence, courage calls to courage everywhere: we’re all in this together,” Robinson said. Beverley Cook, curator of the suffragette collection at the Museum of London, said she thinks it is fashionable for contemporary feminists to reclaim the words of the “votes for women” campaigners for their own ends. “Sometimes the words of the suffragists and suffragettes are taken out of context and given a contemporary reinterpretation.” Terras decided to write the book, which will be published on an open access basis by UCL Press on 9 June, because she could not find the speech Fawcett supposedly made in 1913 and realised that no collection of Fawcett’s speeches and writings existed. “I thought: how can it be that someone so famous as the first woman to have a statue in Parliament Square – how can it be that no one can read her words? And that felt like an injustice to me.”",News/World news,"Famous rallying speech by feminist leader Millicent Fawcett was never made, says new book",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/famous-rallying-speech-by-feminist-leader-millicent-fawcett-was-never-made-says-new-book
5/15/2022,"In among the relief and euphoria that attended the return to Britain of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and businessman Anoosheh Ashoori from Iranian jails in March, one family was feeling precisely the opposite emotions. The Foreign Office deal that finally brought Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori home was always supposed to involve three British prisoners. Morad Tahbaz, 66, has been incarcerated in Tehran for four years. Right up until a week before the deal was made, the Tahbaz family had been told categorically by Liz Truss’s department that Morad – along with his wife, Vida, 64, currently subject to a travel ban in Iran – would be part of any agreement. No one would be left behind. They discovered the truth only when they saw the television news. Roxanne Tahbaz, the couple’s eldest daughter, lives in south-west London. When I spoke to her at her home last week, she was still reliving the despair of seeing those TV pictures. For the previous four years, the Tahbaz family had followed British government advice and not spoken to the media, so as “not to jeopardise any negotiations”. They were in a more complicated situation than Richard Ratcliffe, campaigning in the UK for his wife, since Vida Tahbaz was trapped in Tehran. Roxanne has a brother and a sister. “Our biggest concern was that because we were the only non-public family, we’d be forgotten,” she says. “They were like, ‘no, no. They’re definitely in the deal’.” Tahbaz’s situation is complicated by the fact that he is tri-national; he has US and Iranian passports as well as his British one. Twice previously, the British government had mooted to the family that a deal might be possible in which Tahbaz could be freed from prison but, unlike the others, held in Iran. “We vehemently disagreed with that approach,” Roxanne says. “We were quite certain that if they did that, as soon as the others were back home, they’d put him back in prison. And that’s exactly what happened.” Tahbaz was released from the notorious Evin jail when the deal happened. He was returned there 48 hours later. Four foreign secretaries have overseen the case: Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab and Truss. The family felt that Hunt displayed proper empathy. They haven’t heard directly from Truss since December, when, Roxanne says, “she gave a personal reassurance that my father wouldn’t be left behind”. Tahbaz had been working in animal conservation projects in Iran, on and off, for a decade when he was arrested in 2018. “My mum had just gone over to keep him company,” Roxanne recalls. “He’s an entrepreneur. He started in commercial property development. And then, when he was partly retired, he founded the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation. It was a passion project, working to monitor endangered species.” Iranian authorities arrested Tahbaz along with eight other heritage foundation colleagues. The group were accused of espionage after tracking species with cameras. A UK government committee found no evidence to support that claim. In November 2019, Tahbaz was sentenced to 10 years in prison for “contacts with the US enemy government”. “The Foreign Office have told us the Iranians decided that my father is American,” Roxanne says. “From where we’re sitting, it’s not up to Iran to say. He was born in London, in Hammersmith hospital, a mile up the road from here. He went to school in the UK from the age of four and only then went to university in the States. My mum [also tri-national] has had a British passport since they got married [nearly 40 years ago].” Roxanne can’t allow herself to think that the British government abandoned her father in order to win some quick, positive headlines. But still, the triumphant tone of the Foreign Office messaging was hard to take. “They were making public statements congratulating themselves about their skilful negotiations,” she says. “And we were thinking: excuse me?” She was unable to talk properly to her father in the 48 hours he was out of prison. “He had guards with him all the time. Every hour that passed, we thought he’d be taken away. Later that week, they took him out of the prison again, this time just for 24 hours. It was then that he decided to start a hunger strike, because he couldn’t take it any more.” After nine days, the family persuaded Tahbaz to start eating. He was already in vulnerable health having survived two different cancers in the last decade, which have left him requiring regular monitoring and treatment. That is only one of the reasons why Roxanne finds it hard to think about him in prison. Does she know the circumstances in which he’s being held? “He tries not to talk about it,” she says. “I think he’s so conscious of the fact that he’s still our dad. He gets a chance to call for about two minutes, very infrequently. And then he’s always like, ‘I love you. I miss you. Tell me what’s happening in your life? What’s going on at work? Can I give you any advice?’ “He’s always been that kind of dad. My mum was always the light of the room. And my father was always very collected, calm.” And she never knows when he will call? “Sometimes my mum can connect us [on speaker] and sometimes she can’t. I drive everyone crazy with ‘phantom phone syndrome’. If I wake up in the night, and my phone’s lit up, I’m thinking, ‘Oh my God, did I miss him?’ I take my phone everywhere, to the gym, to the bathroom.” Unless you’ve lived that life, Roxanne says, you can’t imagine what every day is like: “Richard [Ratcliffe] said it best: we’re all a part of a club that nobody wants to be a member of. My mum became quite close with Nazanin, because when Nazanin was out of prison on furlough, they spent time together. She was so wonderful to my mum. And Richard, on this side, was always a guiding light for us. When they did their press conference after Nazanin got home, they rang me the night before and said, ‘we’d like to invite you to come and make a statement because it isn’t right, what has happened’.” Roxanne talked to her brother and sister, and her aunts and uncles. “We took a family vote – everything’s done by committee – and basically decided, if we don’t go public now, my father will never come out.” She stayed up all that night drafting a statement, and was “a basket of nerves, because I never was a public speaker”. In the fortnight after that, she did nearly 50 news interviews. She lives in fear of saying the wrong thing. “The worst thing is that the moment you wake up, you’re always a bit broken. Even if it’s a birthday, you feel guilty to feel any happiness.” Roxanne has continued to work as a business consultant while keeping up her campaigning. “There’s days where I’m just helpless,” she says. “My boyfriend is brilliant. He’ll be: ‘What do you want to eat? Do you want to have a bath? You want a drink?’ I sit there and I’m like: ‘I don’t know’.” Then, a lot of the rest of the time, she says: “You feel it’s like that adrenaline rush when a kid is under a car and the mum finds the strength to lift it. And you think: how long do I have to be this strong?” Amnesty International has declared Tahbaz a “prisoner of conscience”. After we speak, Roxanne has a meeting to discuss progress on their campaign calling on the government to tell the family their plans to secure his release. Unlike Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who campaigned so vocally for Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Roxanne’s MP, the Conservative Felicity Buchan, counsels silence, in line with the Foreign Office. “From the beginning, there was a weekly catch-up call with the family or an email. But ever since the other two were released, the only update we’ve had is: ‘we’re working on everything at the highest levels’,” Roxanne says. “That’s not enough any more.” The Observer contacted Buchan’s office for comment, but did not receive a reply. The family has continued to receive support from Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who raised Tahbaz’s fate when she met the prime minister at Downing Street. In paying the historic debt to Iran of £400m, to ease the release of the two other prisoners, she fears that the British government has played its hand. “What’s left for my father now? What’s the next move? Because this felt like a checkmate moment. “And two months later we’re still sitting on the side, waiting.”",News/World news,‘The Foreign Office has forgotten us’: Morad Tahbaz’s daughter speaks out on him still being incarcerated in Iran,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/morad-tahbaz-daughter-iran-prison-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe
5/15/2022,"Britain’s gambling industry has more than tripled its annual donations over two years to a charity that combats gambling harms, as it campaigns against calls for a statutory levy on betting firms. More than 680 firms donated £34.7m to the industry-funded GambleAware charity in the year to 31 March 2022. This compares with voluntary donations from the sector of £19m the previous year and £10.05m in 2019-20, according to the charity’s figures. While the industry hopes a rise in donations will help to fend off calls for an annual statutory levy, some of the betting firms sanctioned by the regulator for failing to protect high-risk gamblers donated no cash to the charity in the past financial year, or small amounts compared with their revenues. The Malta-based firm Genesis Global was fined £3.8m in December for social responsibility failings, including allowing an NHS nurse to gamble £245,000 in three months. The firm did not donate to GambleAware in the year to 31 March 2022 and gave just £6,000 the previous year, according to the charity’s disclosures. Campaigners consider the funding regime is not generating enough money to combat gambling harms and the distribution of the funds is not sufficiently independent. Liz Ritchie, co-founder of the charity Gambling with Lives, said: “Gambling companies pay what they want when they want and can withdraw funding for health information, research or treatment they’re not happy with. “An independently administered statutory levy will ensure many more resources are available to prevent and treat this devastating illness and … free from the influence of the very companies causing that devastation.” The four biggest gambling companies, Entain, Flutter, William Hill and Bet365, have pledged to pay 1% of their gross gambling yield – which are the retained revenues after payment of winnings – for gambling prevention and treatment initiatives by 2024, but many firms make limited donations. Zoë Osmond, chief executive of GambleAware, said: “GambleAware has been consistent in calling on the government to introduce a mandatory levy of 1% [of gross gambling yield] on the gambling industry as a condition of licence. We welcome the commitment from the ‘big four’ operators to increase their donations. “However, the continuing uncertainty and inconsistency in the current funding system has a detrimental impact on services and fails to provide any organisation working to mitigate gambling harms with any level of long-term income to invest in critical prevention and treatment services.” The Betting and Gaming Council, which represents the industry, says there has already been effective action to reduce problem gambling and a statutory levy is not required. The Observer revealed last week that major betting firms warned the Treasury that the crackdown on the industry called for by campaigners could drive gamblers to the black market. A government white paper on gambling reforms is due to be published shortly. A spokesperson said: “The Betting and Gaming Council’s largest members have already pledged an additional £100m of funding between 2019 and 2023 for research, education and treatment services to be administered by the independent charity GambleAware.

They used silphium as perfume, as medicine, as an aphrodisiac and turned it into a condiment, called laser, that they poured on to almost every dish. It was so valuable that Julius Caesar stashed more than half a tonne in his treasury. Yet it became extinct less than a century later, by the time of Nero, and for nearly 2,000 years people have puzzled over the cause. Researchers now believe it was the first victim of man-made climate change – and warn that we should heed the lesson of silphium or risk losing plants that are the basis of many modern flavours. Paul Pollaro and Paul Robertson of the University of New Hampshire say their research, published in Frontiers in Conservation Science, shows that urban growth and accompanying deforestation changed the local microclimate where silphium grew. “You’ll often see the narrative that it [became extinct] because of a mix of over-harvesting and also over-grazing – sheep were very fond of it and it made the meat more valuable,” Pollaro said. “Our argument is that regardless of how much was harvested, if the climate was changing, silphium was going to go extinct anyway.” Silphium is believed to be a species of Ferula whose modern counterparts include fennel and asafoetida, a spice often used in Indian cooking. It was a bush that grew wild only in a strip of land 30 miles wide and 125 miles long in Cyrenaica, in what is now Libya. The ancient Greeks, who colonised the north African territory in about 630BC, tried and failed for centuries to cultivate silphium. “They talked about the frustrations of trying to transplant it – ‘why doesn’t this stupid silphium plant grow’,” Robertson said. “It had these micro-climactic requirements and they couldn’t figure it out.” Administrators in Cyrene ordered limits on how much silphium could be harvested, and fenced off areas where it grew, Pollaro said. “There’s evidence that they knew it was declining and they tried to preserve the plant. But all of these tactics were ultimately irrelevant, because they had changed the microclimate.” Silphium grew along the drier, sea-facing side of Libya’s Jebel al-Akhdar plateau, a fertile, forested region. After harvesting, it was exported to Rome and beyond. “It’s hard to overstate how important silphium was because the Romans in particular were absolutely obsessed with it,” Pollaro said. “They minted coins in ancient Libya that had silphium on the front of the coin and the god or the emperor’s face on the back.” Herodotus, Theophrastus and Pliny the Elder wrote extensively about the plant and laser. Pliny extolled it as a cure for dog bites, snake venom and haemorrhoids. It could be used as a contraceptive and the plant itself was a prized vegetable. Exports brought wealth, which meant expansion. The Greeks and the Romans, who took control of Cyrenaica about 90BC, cut down forests on the plateau to build bigger and better houses and to clear land for crops for the growing population. Deforestation changed rainfall patterns, causing greater erosion on the hillsides where silphium grew, which Pollaro said was confirmed by excavations at Haua Fteah cave near Benghazi. Silphium’s microclimate was ruined and it disappeared quite rapidly. “In a way, silphium’s value was the cause of its own decline,” Pollaro said. “Without silphium, Cyrene’s economy wouldn’t have grown so much.” Modern climate change is having a similar impact. Asafoetida, a sap extracted from a herb that grows wild in parts of Afghanistan and neighbouring countries, is widely used in India. But its footprint is shrinking due to changes in the local climate. Professor Monique Simmonds of Kew Gardens said coffee, carrots and rice were similarly at risk. “We rely on between 10 and 12 species for most of our food,” she said. Kew was collecting seeds of wild species for its millennium seed bank and this diversity was crucial, since modern varieties might prove vulnerable to changes in climate in ways that could not be foreseen. “If we don’t do the research and collection of wild species, we won’t have the reserves of genetic material in banks to do crosses in the future,” Simmonds added.",News/World news,Caesar’s favourite herb was the Viagra of ancient Rome.

5/15/2022,"A key part of the government’s response to the cost of living crisis has not been available to applicants for months in some parts of the country after councils ran out of money, the Observer can reveal. The government launched the £500m Household Support Fund (HSF) last autumn to help poorer households with essentials. Ministers have highlighted the HSF in response to accusations it isn’t doing enough to help people cope with soaring inflation. Just last week, work and pensions minister Chloe Smith repeatedly cited the HSF in an interview with Channel 4 News. The funding was meant to last until 31 March, but figures sourced under the Freedom of Information Act show one in six English local authorities ran out of funding for applicants at least a month earlier, some as early as December. The bureaucratic nature of the process also meant dozens of councils that still had funding rejected more than a quarter of all applications. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Since the start of the year, we’ve seen record-breaking levels of demand for crisis support amid the cost of living squeeze. Nowhere near enough of the help from the government has been targeted at the low-income households who need it most. “It’s concerning that this limited assistance meant certain councils had to close their schemes early. With only the same amount of money going in again this April, and cost of living pressures rising still further, this won’t be enough for those struggling. “The government urgently needs to put in place targeted financial support through the benefits system, so people aren’t left with nowhere to turn.” Katie Schmuecker, principal policy adviser for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “The government placed considerable faith in the Household Support Fund as its preferred solution to the huge pressures which have been brought to bear on people on low incomes, rather than ensuring the social security system had adequate funding to get people through hard times. “The support available from these sorts of schemes is useful for a one-off emergency, if your fridge breaks and needs to be replaced for example, but they are not suited to dealing with a persistently inadequate income. The crisis we’re facing is a result of very low incomes among the least well off, as prices are rocketing but benefits are nowhere near keeping pace. These schemes have not come close to meeting the scale of the ongoing challenge. “With the cost of living crisis set to become still more acute, schemes like this can’t be relied on to protect people from hardship or the harms that come from it – only a social security system that is fit for purpose can do that.” The government recently extended the HSF to the end of September with another £500m. But while the winter scheme required English councils to ringfence half the money for families with children, those councils now have to guarantee a third of the funding for pensioners and another third for families with children. Because total funding hasn’t increased, less money than before will therefore be ringfenced for families with children. Councils can use some of the remaining third of funding to support this group, but that could draw money away from other people in need. A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ““We extended the Household Support Fund so that targeted support for both families with children and pensioners continues to be available. “It is just one way that we are supporting people with the cost of living, and is part of a wider £22bn package of measures. This includes support for working families as we have boosted the minimum wage by more than £1,000 a year for full-time workers and are putting an average of £1,000 more per year into the pockets of workers on Universal Credit.”",News/Business,Government’s £500m support scheme failing Britain’s poorest households,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/15/governments-500m-support-scheme-failing-britains-poorest-households
5/15/2022,"Boris Johnson is already facing a growing backlash within his party over his decision to shelve a plan to ban “buy-one-get-one-free” supermarket deals and pre-watershed TV advertising for junk food. The prime minister ordered the delay as part of a decree for Whitehall to find ways of easing the cost of living crisis. However, senior Tories have warned the delay risks heaping more pressure on the NHS and contributing to serious disease. Dan Poulter, a Tory MP and former health minister, urged the prime minister to rethink. “The biggest health challenge facing the UK is obesity, which we know is linked to many chronic health conditions including diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure – all of which can shorten lives and put tremendous pressure on the NHS,” he told the Observer. “Whilst there is no silver bullet, banning junk food advertisements and buy-one-get-one-free deals would be an important step forwards, so it is disappointing the government is shelving these plans, and I hope it reconsiders.” The decision is likely to receive scrutiny from the Commons health select committee. It is headed by Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who once described the worsening childhood obesity problem as a “national emergency”. Another former health minister warned the decision could “blow a hole” in the government’s obesity strategy, which Johnson championed after his own weight put him at risk when he became ill with Covid-19. James Bethell, who piloted the measures, said dropping the plans risked having a “massive follow-on effect on all of our health targets”. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “The cancer 10-year plan, the extra five years of longevity and many more of our health targets are damaged by this.” “All of this illness that is caused by [being] overweight from junk food is being carried by the NHS and by the taxpayer. We do need to account for all of the costs of the obesity crisis in this country, and it is one way of mitigating those costs without actually banning things or taking more extreme measures.” Former health secretary Matt Hancock has also previously stated that if overweight adults lost five pounds in weight, it could save the NHS some £100m. The prime minister took the decision to shelve the measures for at least a year after a ministerial meeting last week on the cost of living. With the Treasury reluctant to spend more on tackling the issue, all departments are under pressure to find ways of easing the crisis. Bethell warned that delaying the plans effectively meant they would not go ahead before the next election – putting them at risk indefinitely. “Parliamentary practicalities are that it will be extremely difficult to return to these measures before the next election,” he said. “I’d like to take the government at its word, but naturally I am concerned that this is backing off the obesity strategy top to bottom.” The Department of Health and Social Care has said the delayed ban on multi-buy promotions would come into effect in October 2023, and that on TV adverts before the 9pm watershed will now be in January 2024.",News/Business,Tory backlash grows over delay to junk food TV ad ban,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/15/tory-backlash-grows-over-delay-to-junk-food-tv-ad-ban
5/15/2022,"One of the bestselling business books of all time is called Who Moved My Cheese? by Spencer Johnson and has sold 30m copies worldwide since 1998. It is a book about change and features two sets of creatures, mouse and human, who are either trying to replicate old patterns and find long-lost cheese or be adventurous and discover new supplies of it. It is rather a fitting parable for the emerging battle lines around post-pandemic working practices, specifically how much knowledge workers use the office and what productivity gains look like with new hybrid working patterns. Another Johnson is also using cheese to make his point. The prime minister said on Friday: “My experience of working from home is you spend an awful lot of time walking very slowly to the fridge, hacking off a small piece of cheese, then walking very slowly back to your laptop.” This message – that all you do is nibble unproductively and waste time when you work from home – has been echoed by a series of poster-men (and it is men of a certain generation) for RTO or “return to office” from business and government around the world, including David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, who called working from home an “aberration”; Lord Sugar, who railed against the “lazy gits” at PWC who are working “summer hours” out of office; and of course Jacob Rees-Mogg, who took to touring empty Whitehall offices and leaving passive-aggressive “Sorry you were out” notes on desks. From a management and leadership perspective, all I can say is that this strategy is not much better than calling workers “cheese-eating surrender monkeys” (a term memorably coined by The Simpsons – the same year that Who Moved My Cheese? was published – to describe the French), and it is interesting that some politicians and business leaders are deciding that attacking the workforce is their best line of defence against the seismic changes they are facing: the tightest labour market in decades, rising inflation, and a global rejection of a return to office life with all the economic and cultural disruption that implies. The timing of Boris Johnson’s remarks coincided with the media briefing by Rees-Mogg that the civil service can be cut by as much a a fifth. He has deliberately conflated the question of cuts to the service with criticism of the emerging hybrid model of three days a week in the office and two remotely, which is fast becoming the norm in post-pandemic cities around the world. To do so is not just bad politics but flies in the face of evidence that new working patterns which give workers agency, flexibility and a mix of in-office social time with self-managed, less monitored work is productive. Professor Nicholas Bloom of Stanford showed in a study of 16,000 workers that productivity can rise by as much as 13% on this basis. Data from Ipsos consistently shows that across all demographics flexibility to work differently is desirable, with 65% saying they are more productive when they work flexibly. So why the political and management resistance? Let’s go back to cheese. Old habits die hard, and changing command-and-control models is an undeniable challenge. Implementing hybrid is hard and will involve experimentation and iteration. The indecisive, change-resistant human characters in Who Moved My Cheese? are called “Hem and Haw”. It takes them considerably longer to realise that they have to go through the maze they are in to find new sources of cheese than it does their more entrepreneurial counterparts “Sniff and Scurry”. Today Hem and Haw are those leaders who would prefer to see pointless presenteeism rather than be curious enough to find out how their staff like to work and can be best productive. The post-pandemic office is entirely different from how it was before. Teleconferencing and technology have collided with cultural shifts, and people want to better integrate their work self with the rest of their life. When it comes to the politics of work and the post-pandemic workplace, 2022 will be remembered for the battle between the fridge and the watercooler. But to borrow from another phrase, those creating the policies and tasked with making them work need to keep it real. Change is in the air and someone just moved the cheese.

5/15/2022,"Nahed Araf Imran and her husband Jamal were exhausted but excited on Wednesday morning: Nahed was in labour with their third child at a local hospital in Nablus, in the north of the occupied West Bank. But when Jamal’s mother arrived at the hospital crying just before the couple’s daughter was born, he knew something was wrong. “I asked her what happened and she told me that Shireen Abu Aqleh had been shot dead by the Israelis. Shireen had visited us in our town, Bureen, and covered demonstrations here many times. Everybody knows her,” the 29-year-old construction worker said. “My mum was heartbroken. I said to myself, when the baby comes, we will call her Shireen, and my wife agreed.” Shireen Abu Aqleh Jamal Imran came into the world at about noon on Wednesday. At dawn that morning, her namesake, a 51-year-old veteran Al Jazeera journalist, had been shot in the head and killed during an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) raid in the West Bank town of Jenin. Israeli officials said they believed the dual Palestinian-American citizen had died after being hit by Palestinian fire during an altercation between IDF soldiers and Palestinian gunmen. But the reporter’s colleagues at the scene said there were no militants near the small group of journalists – all wearing helmets and body armour clearly marked as “press” – when they came under fire from the direction of the Israeli unit. Ali Samodi, an Al Jazeera producer who was shot in the back, told the Observer from his hospital bed that even after Abu Aqleh had fallen to the ground and colleagues tried to reach her, the bullets kept coming. Video of the incident confirms this version of events. Israel has firmly rejected allegations that its soldiers deliberately targeted the journalists, but the international community is demanding answers in what Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based TV network, has described as an “assassination” carried out “in cold blood”. Unlike the killings of anonymous Palestinians that occur in the occupied West Bank on a regular basis, Abu Aqleh was a familiar face, broadcasting to millions across the Arab world and well known for her bravery during a 15-year television news career. She was also a US citizen. This time, an Israeli strategy of deflection and denial has backfired. What is seen by the Palestinians as Israeli obfuscation also threatens to inflame a spate of violence that has surged across Israel and the Palestinian territories since late March. A video released by the IDF of what it said were Palestinian militants engaged in a firefight in Jenin on the morning Abu Aqleh was killed has been heavily criticised: human rights group B’Tselem, which visited the two locations, found it was impossible for the shooting in the IDF-distributed video to be the same gunfire that hit Abu Aqleh and Samodi. And the spectacle of Israeli police storming Abu Aqleh’s funeral procession in Jerusalem on Friday, causing pallbearers to drop her coffin, has added to Palestinian and international outrage. The public display of Palestinian flags in occupied East Jerusalem is forbidden by the Israeli authorities under any circumstances, but many mourners arrived waving Palestinian banners. The journalist’s casket was also draped in the flag, followed by an orange stretcher bearing a flak jacket marked “press”. The EU said it was appalled by the “unnecessary” force used by the Israeli police, while the White House described footage of the scene as “deeply disturbing”. Israel’s police said the mourners were “disrupting public order” by throwing stones at the heavy police presence, but on Saturday said an investigation into the officers’ actions would be launched. “I was horrified by what I saw on TV from the funeral. I think it shows how Shireen exposed [Israel], she succeeded in that not just in life but in death also,” Imran said. Not letting her funeral proceed with respect … they have publicly exposed themselves for the world to see.” The battle of narratives sparked by Abu Aqleh’s death is far from over. Palestinian officials have rejected the Israeli offer of a joint investigation, saying “criminals cannot be trusted”, leading Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett to accuse the Palestinians of denying Israel “access to the basic findings required to get to the truth”. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said during a state memorial for Abu Aqleh in the Palestinian town of Ramallah on Thursday that the case will be referred to the international criminal court, of which Israel is not a member and whose jurisdiction the state disputes. An interim Israeli army investigation “could not determine” who fired the fatal bullet, an IDF statement said on Friday, while an initial probe by the Palestinian public prosecution found that “the only origin of the shooting was the Israeli occupation forces”. In the meantime, even more so than during her career, Abu Aqleh’s fame has grown. Outside the reporter’s home in Beit Hanina in East Jerusalem this week, neighbours and friends gathered daily to mourn her death despite a raid on the house on Wednesday by Israeli forces: many have put up pictures of her in their windows. On the quiet street outside, local children gather waving Palestinian flags. “Shireen was a Christian and we are a Muslim family, but that didn’t matter,” one neighbour said. “She has united us.” For the thousands of people who have thronged streets across the West Bank and Jerusalem this week in tribute, Abu Aqleh’s life and death has become a potent symbol. “Shireen’s story is the story of the Palestinian people,” said Imran, the father of newborn Shireen. “She will never be forgotten, especially for our family. Every time we call her name we will remember.”",News/World news,Shireen Abu Aqleh: ‘Cold-blooded’ killing and funeral chaos leave West Bank in turmoil ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/cold-blooded-killing-and-funeral-chaos-leave-west-bank-in-turmoil
5/15/2022,"Iwas delighted to receive the following letter from Jonathan Hauxwell, from North Yorkshire, about my last column, which included a reference to the Great British Dialect Hunt. “I discovered new (to me) words on the streets of Hartlepool in the 1950s... only they weren’t new. They were terms spoken since Viking tongues brought them to the north-east more than a thousand years before. Words such as rive, meaning to tug at; femmer – thin or fragile; ket – rubbish (the plural form meant sweets!). The one that sealed the link came when I was watching a Danish friend’s dog furiously scratching. I used a childhood dialect word and said it must be ‘loppy’. Loppe is the Danish word for flea.” Excellent gen, Mr Hauxwell, for which I thank you. In recent columns, I’ve written about the British becoming a nation of somnambulists, given the plentiful number of newspaper headlines warning that we are “sleepwalking into...” (insert your own ending). I’ve also in the not too distant past written about doom loops, so you can imagine my unalloyed delight when I read the following headline: “Work-shy Britain is sleepwalking into a doom-spiral of class war and decline.” It was as if all my Christmases had come at once. I’m pleased to say that the article beneath was suitably apocalyptic, rich in “vortexes of decline”, “farragos of broken promises” and the private sector succumbing to “the dead hand of woke capital”.

5/15/2022,"Everyone can remember where they were when, on Monday of last week, they heard that Pete Waterman, of 1980s pop-production duo Stockhausen and Waterman, had died. I was on a garage forecourt on the A1 near Melton Mowbray eating a bag of chicken Fridge Raiders in the rain next to a broken outside toilet. And as the jolly earworm of I Should Be So Lucky burrowed into my brainpan, it had never seemed less appropriate. Sadly, Pete Waterman did not live to see the timeless and dignified pageantry of Tuesday’s Queen’s speech to parliament. The most expensive hat in the world was driven, in its own luxury car, to an inappropriate event that, against the backdrop of impending starvation and Brexit-bonus economic disaster, now seemed cruelly tasteless. Prince Charles, like the mythic prisoner of a hypnotic cabal, listlessly intoned a draconian bonfire of citizens’ rights, whacked out of his gourd on organic wine. The jewel-hat sat next to him on its own velvet cushion, like an oligarch’s cat. If it were sold, it could probably fill every food bank in Britain for ever. Idea for screenplay – The Queen II. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen with all wrinkles drawn on him) comes out of exile to advise the royal family once more on how, given fuel poverty and the public mood, now might not be the best time, your majesty, to drive the most expensive hat in the world around London in its own luxury car. The cautious moderniser Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) agrees Blair may have a point, while sucking on a Cornish leek. The Queen (Brian Blessed I am afraid, as Helen Mirren is now too expensive) sees a dead pig hanging upside down in the Buckingham Palace abattoir, is reminded of that nice David Cameron and wishes he was still in charge. He should be so lucky! However, Pete Waterman should be so lucky as well, as it turned out he wasn’t dead after all. The Rick Astley hitmaker was merely the misplaced subject of a typically bewildered Monday morning mis-tweet by the horse-warming education secretary Nadhim Zahawi. “RIP Pete. A great actor. Grew up watching Minder.” Zahawi presumably meant Dennis Waterman, who had died, rather than Pete Waterman, who had not. The minister was displaying a fluency with arts and culture to rival Nadine Dorries. I felt the seeds of this week’s column starting to take root. Soon the Tories would enjoy the sting of my satire! The Conservatives and their slave journalists in the rightwing press, or the press as it is also known, had spent more than two weeks now stirring the bullshit barrel of the Beergate non-story. But since Starmer’s kamikaze resignation promise, the Tories’ bubbling Beergate cauldron was boiling over, threatening to take down Big Dog with it and spattering the shiny faces of his fourth-estate facilitators with filth. Dan Hodges of the Daily Mail runs home to calm down by dancing to his favourite record, the Wurzels’ I Want to Be an Eddie Stobart Driver. Carrie Johnson’s ex-boyfriend, Harry Cole of the Sun, an eldritch death god manifesting as a baked potato, dabs dung from his apple cheeks unenthusiastically. And Alex Deane, from Twitter (and sometimes the TV at night), appears to have fallen into the actual cauldron, the festering filth fusing naturally with his human form at a subatomic level, the Swamp Thing of client journalism. Sensing that Beergate might be about to blow, a Fukushima of falsehoods, the panicked Conservative attack machine suddenly decided it didn’t think Starmer should resign after all. Would they, I wondered, turn to other methods to steer the headlines, so they could continue to asset-strip the country, like a troop of Longleat monkeys systematically dismantling the exterior fixtures of a 1970s family car while also masturbating? Zahawi would, as ever, be the perfect distracto-patsy, the Prometheus of the morning press round, his liver pecked out daily by Kay Burley. Zahawi grits his teeth as Burley whips him like a hot mare, thinking of the consolation of the warmed stallions waiting for him at home. I imagined a situation where CCHQ’s dead-cat plan for the week was to use Zahawi as a plausibly stupid mouthpiece for a drip feed of ludicrous announcements, primed to distract from the Tories’ ongoing corruption and incompetence. On Tuesday, Zahawi could take to Twitter to announce: “Sad to hear Gérard Depardieu has put his head into a bee nest to get honey, like a fat bear. Has been stang so much with bee juice he is now half a bee, like Timothy West in that thing.” On Wednesday, CCHQ attack strategists might command Zahawi to tell his 86.8k followers: “Sad. Eels have gone in Hilary Mantel’s computer & laid eggs in electricity where new book on the Polish playwright Stanisława Przybyszewska kept.” On Thursday, Zahawi would announce: “Adult film star Rocco Siffredi’s penis gone black and fallen off into Rome’s Torre Argentina square. Stray cat has run off with it before it could be winched to safety. Condolences Rocco!” But my fantasy of Zahawi fabricating a world of fictions to save his government from scrutiny evaporated minutes before my deadline. Apparently, a blameless Zahawi had merely been repeating an inaccurate tweet about Pete Waterman from his nemesis Kay Burley. Had Burley ensnared Zahawi in a honeytrap of lies? Whatever, my idea for a funny column was strangled at birth. The best laid plans of mice and Nadhim Zahawi often go awry. Boris Johnson’s flank exposed, would client journalists re-stoke the shit volcano of Beergate? Poor Dan Hodges of the Daily Mail was exhausted. Hadn’t he done enough? Mad with fatigue, he took to Twitter and pressed send. “People are assuming that if Starmer gets away with not breaking the law he’s in the clear.” It’s relentless.

5/15/2022,"North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has warned his country has been thrown into “great turmoil” after reporting another 21 deaths, days after the secretive state first admitted it was in the grip of a coronavirus outbreak. The nation’s total death toll now stands at 27, with 524,440 illnesses attributed to a rapid spread of fever consistent with Covid since late April. The regime said 243,630 people had recovered and 280,810 remained in quarantine. However, it did not specify how many of the cases and deaths had been confirmed as Covid-19 infections. The wave of Covid-19 cases comes as other nations, such as South Africa, have reported fresh outbreaks of the disease while the US revealed last week that it had recorded more than 80m Covid cases since the pandemic began. More than one million people have died in the US from the disease, a figure described as “a tragic milestone” by President Joe Biden. These global developments indicate that the Covid pandemic is showing no signs of retreating. North Korea imposed “maximum preventive measures” in a nationwide lockdown on Friday after conceding that its attempts to contain the virus over the past two years had failed. “The spread of the malignant epidemic is a great turmoil to fall on our country since the founding,” Kim told an emergency meeting of the ruling Workers’ party. “But if we don’t lose focus in implementing epidemic policy and maintain strong organisation power … we can more than overcome the crisis.” The outbreak presents a potentially serious risk to North Korea, which is not believed to have vaccinated its 26 million people. Its poorly resourced healthcare system would also struggle to cope with a major outbreak, say international health officials. Kee Park of Harvard Medical School said the regime is testing only 1,400 people a week. North Korea had previously insisted it had not recorded a single Covid case since it closed its borders at the start of the pandemic more than two years ago. That move cut off trade with China and inflicted more damage on an economy already battered by natural disaster and UN sanctions imposed in response to its nuclear and missile tests. After maintaining one of the world’s strictest border closures to shield its poor healthcare system, North Korea eventually reopened railroad freight traffic with China in January. North Korea has shunned offers of Covid vaccines from China and Russia, and from the World Health Organization’s Covax scheme – apparently because administering the jabs would require outside monitoring. In South Africa, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases reported last week that there had been 10,017 new Covid-19 cases a day. It was the first time since January that the institute had logged more than 10,000 new daily infections. Health authorities have warned the new surge of infections is driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants, which are now dominant in South Africa. The country only exited a fourth wave of Covid in January but the southern hemisphere winter months had long been seen as a potential problem. However, the rapid spread of the new variants do not appear to have prompted an equivalent surge in hospitalisations, and severe disease, though another 114 deaths were reported on Friday, bringing the official total to 100,744. Joe Phaahla, the South African health minister, said vaccines remained the best defence against the virus and denied that the country’s vaccination effort had struggled to meet even modest objectives. Just under 50% of the adult population of about 40 million have received at least one dose of vaccine, with only 45% of adults fully vaccinated. More than two-thirds of the population are thought to have some immunity based on past exposure to the virus. In the US, health authorities have reported that coronavirus cases are surging in most counties in New York State, putting them on a high alert status under the national health guidelines which include recommendations for wearing masks indoors, including schools. By Thursday, new cases stood at more than 10,000 a day, a 47% increase in two weeks, with hospitalisations rising by 28% over that time period to more than 2,600 a day. About 77% of people are fully vaccinated in New York State, a figure that rises to 79% in New York City. Last week, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reclassified Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 as “variants of concern” and said they threatened a significant overall increase in Covid-19 cases in the EU in the coming weeks and months but not any “significant increase in infection severity”.",News/World news,"North Korea ‘in great turmoil’ over Covid death toll, says Kim Jong-un",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/north-korea-in-great-turmoil-over-covid-death-toll-says-kim-jong-un
5/15/2022,"This week the blue door will slide back, a Black woman will walk to the lectern and a piece of White House history will be made. Karine Jean-Pierre, facing rows of reporters and cameras, will be making her briefing room debut as the first Black woman and first openly gay person in the role of press secretary. Not that there will be much time to stand on ceremony. “Karine is the right person to carry the weight of being a history maker but that aspect of it will last all of five warm minutes at the podium,” predicted Patrick Gaspard, a longtime colleague who is now chief executive of the Center for American Progress thinktank in Washington. “About five minutes in, being the first ever is going to mean hardly anything to folks who are hearing from her and certainly it’s not a crutch that Karine is going to rely upon. She knows that she’s got to be better prepared than anyone.” It does indeed promise to be baptism of fire. Jean-Pierre takes over as top messenger for a Joe Biden administration grappling with inflation, Ukraine and a national shortage of baby formula as the Democratic party is bracing for November election losses that could end its control of Congress. But the symbolism of the appointment is inescapable after the Donald Trump era in which all four press secretaries were white. Jean-Pierre once declared: “I am everything that Donald Trump hates. I’m a Black woman, I’m gay, I am a mom. Both my parents were born in Haiti.” The 47-year-old was born in Martinique to Haitian parents and raised in the Queens Village neighborhood of New York. Her early career included a stint working for James Sanders, then a city council member in New York, now a state senator, and at the Center for Community and Corporate Ethics, pushing big companies such as Walmart to change their business practices. She has not always picked winners. Jean-Pierre was press secretary to Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York, later jailed for sending sexually explicit text messages to a minor, and served on the presidential election campaign of John Edwards, who also fell from grace in a sex scandal. But her big break came when Gaspard hired her to work on Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign and then in the Obama White House as a regional director in the office of political affairs. Gaspard, the son of Haitian immigrants, said: “She and I have been in the trenches together. We’re Haitian-American family. “She and I can sometimes finish one another’s thoughts just on the basis of the culture that we’re steeped in. There is a deep sense of public service and the integrity of governance that’s really important to most immigrant communities and certainly for Haitian-Americans who appreciate that there are opportunities in democratic service available to them here that are tragically denied at home.” Jean-Pierre was deputy campaign manager on Martin O’Malley’s 2016 presidential campaign, then chief public affairs officer for the progressive grassroots group MoveOn. At one of its events in 2019, an animal rights protester leaped on stage and tried to seize then Senator Kamala Harris’s microphone. Jean-Pierre kept her cool, springing from her chair to shoo him away. Old colleagues say she has the ideal temperament for the pressure cooker of the briefing room with its sometimes hostile questioning. Ben Wikler, a former senior adviser at MoveOn, now chair of the Wisconsin Democratic party, said: “One of Karine’s superpowers is to keep her nerve in the face of chaos and high stakes.” “She has a deep wealth of experience in working on the political side and communications roles and doing a lot of live television work has really given her a sense of poise and confidence about handling delicate and breaking news situations.” He added: “Everyone’s blood temperature went down when she had the microphone because they knew that she is so effective at bringing things back to the message that needed to be conveyed.” Jean-Pierre appeared as a political analyst on the NBC and MSNBC networks but, with Biden’s election, returned to the White House. As principal deputy press secretary she has sometimes briefed in Psaki’s absence, for example when the latter was ill with coronavirus. Psaki, a self-declared policy wonk, has told the New York Times that, before the door to the briefing room slides open, both women often do a dance to shake off their nerves. With Psaki now reportedly heading to MSNBC, Biden offered the top job to Jean-Pierre in the Oval Office. A day after her appointment, she received a standing ovation at a recent media awards ceremony in New York organised by the LGBTQ+ organisation Glaad. Sarah Kate Ellis, its chief executive and president, said: “Just when we thought her standing ovation would subside, the audience at the Glaad Media Awards issued another wave of applause, because representation matters. “When Karine takes the podium as press secretary, every little girl, especially Black girls, and every LGBTQ kid, will see they can belong just as they are, that you can be LGBTQ and can contribute and be valued wherever you go. Karine represents the best of America and what we can be.” Jean-Pierre’s partner is Suzanne Malveaux, a correspondent at CNN. Amid questions over potential conflicts of interest, the network has said Malveaux “will continue in her role as CNN National Correspondent covering national/international news and cultural events but will not cover politics, Capitol Hill, or the White House”. On Friday, at her 224th and final briefing – more than all Trump’s press secretaries combined, though with rather less drama or viewers – Psaki was asked what lessons she wants to pass on to Jean-Pierre, who smiled from her familiar position at the side of the room. “The last thing I would say is that it can be repetitive in here from time to time,” she reflected. “That’s not a critique. You are all doing your jobs. But in the age of social media, always provide the context and all of the details, because you never want to be a meme with one line. “But otherwise be yourself and Karine, as I said last week, is going to bring her own magic, her brilliance, her style to this briefing room.”",News/US news,‘A history maker’: Karine Jean-Pierre set for White House press secretary role ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/15/karine-jean-pierre-white-house-press-secretary
5/15/2022,"At 11.16am on Wednesday 9 October 2019, I tweeted four words: “Coleen Rooney: Wagatha Christie.” Within five minutes, it became clear that people liked the pun. Within 20 minutes, it became clear that it was a slightly different beast; the two-word pun was shared worldwide, at speed, and with a positivity that is unfamiliar to any regular user of Twitter. People liked it. A lot. Some reactions were, in my opinion, over-enthusiastic. Someone said I should be knighted. Another said they would “legit marry” whoever came up with Wagatha Christie. One recommended I should be made prime minister, but I think recent events have demonstrated that electing a PM purely on the basis of finding them amusing can be unwise. One newspaper reported that a stylist made £50,000 in 24 hours selling merchandise: a black T-shirt with the words of my tweet written across the middle. The speed with which these monetising companies operate is frightening. It hadn’t even occurred to me that there might be a profitable angle. I was content enough that I’d achieved something that had impressed my kids for nearly 45 whole minutes…. The phrase entered the mainstream. It became downright ubiquitous; if you Google the words you get around 60m impressions. Credible newsreaders say the word “Wagatha” as if it’s a normal part of day-to-day English rather than a piece of nonsense I dumped on Twitter while waiting for a coffee to brew. After a week or so, the world and the internet moved on to new and equally insubstantial sources of entertainment and my moment had passed. I returned to my normal daily routine of unsuccessfully trying to impress my children. Then, this month, without warning, the trial rolled around and the Wagatha Christie machine lurched into motion again. (Actually, there were warnings – court schedules are freely available but I hadn’t been paying attention.) I thought that there had been an inordinate amount of coverage at the time of Coleen Rooney’s Instagram post. I was entirely unprepared for the absolute Wagalanche of articles and headlines that were produced; I haven’t been able to open a website or newspaper without having my preposterous phrase thrust upon me in 32-point. To have something you wrote taken out of your hands on this scale is definitely surreal, but I would be lying if I said I wasn’t pleased. So imagine my shock when my attention was drawn to a BBC article crediting my joke to someone in Belgium! How? Why? Surely a quick search through the timeline would prove my claim? I checked back to be sure and there it was. Everything just as I remembered. I had tweeted it a full 20 minutes (in Twitter time that’s decades) before anyone else. Dedicated Twitter archaeologists had even crosschecked and verified my time zone. But then… I saw it. The original tweet had something that I, and the thousands of people who spread it across the globe had missed and the reason that the BBC’s fact-checking had missed me. A spelling mistake. I had accidentally included a stray “g”, writing “Wagagtha”. My contribution to English literature forever published with an error in 50% of the content. I felt as Shakespeare might have had he written “to be or not to bee”. In my defence, I was possibly the first person to ever write the word Wagatha and spelling mistakes are an occupational hazard of the linguistic pioneer. If others tweeted it with more accuracy after me, I can only hope they acknowledge it is in part thanks to my courage. That stray “g”, however, will haunt me until I am under the ground, a gravestone above me with the inscription: “Here lies the man who briefly went viral but cocked it up – ‘RIGP’.” Despite my error, I still maintain that I was first in any meaningful sense and I am happy to go all the way to the high court to prove my claim. I think it would be only fitting, actually. I’ve got nothing to hide; I am willing to have all my messages about Danny Drinkwater and chipolatas repeated from the courtroom floor. We could run the Wagatha trials in parallel, perhaps even negotiate some kind of two-for-one deal with the royal courts of justice? I think anyone who can explain how they go viral is being untruthful. It is something that happens to you, not something for which you can plan. I think timing and dumb luck have a lot to do with it. There is something joyful and pure about a word as stupid as Wagatha. It’s just so silly. And it’s pleasing to say – it even feels silly in your mouth. Right now, when world events are generally worrying and serious, silly things are more valuable than ever. It’s funny to think that this was probably my peak. Of course I’d rather have been known for my unplayable slow left-arm bowling or my delicious vinaigrette dressing, but we don’t get to choose. Wagatha it is then.

5/15/2022,"My son grabbed me by the arm, propelling me across Lloyd Park to the loud, blaring attractions of the smallest funfair I have ever seen. ‘It seems a bit packed,’ I said to my wife – from a distance which only increased as it became clear she was not joining us – only to discover a truly Where’s Wally? level of congestion on closer view. She was wearing the baby in a sling, and craftily used this as an excuse to hang back in the serene sunshine of the outer park, leaving me and the boy to enter the groaning flesh pile by ourselves. We were immediately in the queue for the front kiosk since strolling through the throng was invariably a process of altering your position in the eight queues which looped and swirled through its every dimension. They say if you stretched out all the veins and arteries in your body end to end, they’d reach the moon. By that same token, if you’d lined up every single person who was queueing in the enclosure in Walthamstow, at least some of them could probably have reached a better, larger funfair a few boroughs over. Speaking of tokens, my first quest was to discover how many I’d need to buy from the entry kiosk. Most of the rides seemed to be about three tokens, and taking in him and myself, I decided 30 would be sufficient. I should have realised this was foolhardy when the woman doling them out hesitated for a moment, before relieving me of £30 and sending me three steps left into what I took to be freedom, but turned out to be the queue for a bouncy house. It soon became clear that adults weren’t allowed on any of the rides, even in a supervisory capacity, and that there were many fewer attractions than I’d surmised. Furthermore, neither the Hook-a-Duck stand nor any of the food vendors accepted tokens at all, meaning I had essentially made myself the Elon Musk of the Lloyd Park funfair for no reason whatsoever. Things took a further dip into humiliation when it became clear my son was only willing to commit to entering a ride once we’d reached the top of its queue, which meant on several occasions a 15-minute shuffle through an unbroken chain of human frustration ended with him cheerfully declaring, ‘I don’t want to,’ so we could abruptly leave the queue and attempt somewhere else. Nine queues, one successful go on the little horses and a full hour later, we emerged, sweaty and exhausted to find Mum and baby relaxing on a nearby grass bank. ‘Have fun?’ she asked, as I trundled toward her in a miserable dumbshow of haggard resentment. I slumped to the ground. As she regarded me in my full pathetic splendour, 27 small, red discs spewed from my pocket to complete the sorry tableau. Not for the first time, I wonder if she only married me for my tokens. Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

5/15/2022,"The Essex Serpent Apple TV+The British Academy Television Awards (BBC One) | iPlayerFergal Keane: Living With PTSD (BBC Two) | iPlayerClark Netflix There comes a time in every actor’s life when he must unbutton his period drama shirt and smoulder as if his life depends on it. In Apple TV+’s new six-parter The Essex Serpent, based on the historical novel by Sarah Perry, adapted by Anna Symon, directed by Clio Barnard, this duty falls to Tom Hiddleston, but he rather fluffs it. Hiddleston plays a late-19th-century pastor trying to soothe marsh-dwelling locals who believe they are being menaced by a giant mythical sea serpent (think the Loch Ness monster, but with Godzilla’s temper). Claire Danes plays English widow and naturalist Cora, who, freed of her abusive husband, takes her autistic child and socialist servant (Hayley Squires) to investigate the creature. Once in Essex – spoiler alert! – Cora is drawn into an anguished love triangle with Hiddleston’s man of the cloth and his ailing wife (Clémence Poésy). In 1988, Ken Russell’s Lair of the White Worm wove a similar tale in the spirit of mythic campery. By contrast, The Essex Serpent is ambitiously gothic, coiling itself around a series of personal, mystical and ideological standoffs: principle versus emotion, faith versus rationalism, superstition versus science. Cora emerges as a proto-feminist with startling tangerine-hued hair (reminiscent of Cate Blanchett’s Elizabeth I) and wonderfully dramatic clothes that echo the atmospheric Essex wetlands. These are conveyed in a series of misty aerial shots featuring cawing gulls and slabs of sodden mud. A recurring criticism of period drama is how prissy and vanilla it can be, sanitising rather than illuminating past eras, but visually this is in the “red in tooth and claw” zone: nature with its entrails out. Sadly, the serpent keeps getting forgotten, when surely the idea of it – the threat, the metaphor – should be omnipresent. There is also the problem of chemistry, as in: Danes and Hiddleston don’t have any. While Danes is suitably impassioned, Hiddleston clearly didn’t get the sexy-religious-dude memo and somehow manages to be simultaneously stiff and soggy. Together, they exude the erotic heat of a bed bath administered with a lukewarm flannel. It’s made worse because Frank Dillane, as Cora’s doctorly admirer, is brilliantly witty and naughty – how come he receives a Victorian-era friend-zoning in favour of the drippy pastor? I’m all for the way The Essex Serpent basks in gothic allure, but it could have been wilder. Of all the serious issues raised by Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars, among the more minor is that awards ceremonies have been lent a certain frisson. Tuning into BBC One’s post-pandemic British Academy Television Awards at the Royal Festival Hall, hosted by Richard Ayoade, I wondered who might kick off: does brutality lurk untamed behind Olivia Colman’s red-carpet smile? Of course nothing happened. The reliably acid Ayoade briefly referred to the slap, while giving the starry audience less a mauling, more a teasingly non-specific pawing, like a cat toying with a roomful of overdressed celebrity mice: “No one works harder than us. Apart from people in other professions.” This year’s categories were so absurdly strong, it was possible to fume as Céline Buckens missed out on best supporting actress for Showtrial and then cheer as Cathy Tyson won it for Help. Similarly, it was only right that Time won best miniseries, and an absolute outrage that the other contenders – Landscapers, Stephen, It’s a Sin – didn’t. Shock of the night was that It’s a Sin won zilch, despite a plethora of nominations (it did win the big award – best director – at Bafta’s Television Craft awards in April). Along the way, Channel 4 and the BBC were showered with podium love, and quite right too. These are, after all, perilous times for broadcasting: Nadine Dorries is in charge, a woman who probably thinks “dramatic licence” is something she should be charging pensioners for. In the BBC Two documentary Fergal Keane: Living With PTSD, the much-garlanded Irish war correspondent – a 30-year veteran of conflict zones including Northern Ireland, South Africa and Rwanda – examines how reporters can return unharmed, but only on the outside. Keane went public some time ago about his PTSD (he was diagnosed in 2008), and the documentary opens with him reporting from Ukraine, then withdrawing, saying he wouldn’t be able to cope. From there, he is all brutal honesty as he examines the “ego and addiction” of war reporting, alongside the idealism and the relentless havoc PTSD wreaks on mental health. Keane suffered nightmares about being trapped beneath bodies, used alcohol to medicate, and turned into a paranoid nightmare his family were forced to tiptoe around. “It’s shite,” he says simply. Keane brings in other voices, including the therapist who helped him and a former Rwandan child refugee, now living in Paris, whose escape in the back of a truck Keane reported. Towards the end of this fascinating, candid documentary, Keane says matter-of-factly: “It’s not finished – the story of me and PTSD.” Indeed, he’s shown returning to Ukraine; away from the frontline to report on the refugee crisis, but still, there he is. You wonder if this is his way of forging a PTSD compromise with himself. If you’re yearning for something different, watch Clark on Netflix. Swedish-made, in six parts, it stars Bill Skarsgård as Clark Olofsson, “Sweden’s favourite gangster” and charismatic super-seducer, whose myrad real-life criminal escapades include the Norrmalmstorg bank robbery that inspired the psychological term Stockholm syndrome. Olofsson’s life story is bizarre enough: if he’s not smuggling drugs in oranges from Beirut, he’s seducing the ladies or barking his catchphrase at officialdom: “Go shit yourself!” Instead of calming all this down, director Jonas Åkerlund ramps everything up with a frenetic pace, surrealist graphics and gonzo humour. Skarsgård is superb, playing Olofsson with crazed screwball energy. I’m halfway through, and it’s becoming a little tiring: I’ll be needing paracetamol and a nap soon. Still, for those who can hack it, Clark is that rarest of TV phenomena: something that feels genuinely original.

5/15/2022,"Conical bras, striped sailor tops and gender-neutral designs… Jean Paul Gaultier has been in fashion for more than 50 years. He has dressed Madonna, Björk and Lady Gaga, and was elevated to cult status in the 1990s as the co-presenter of Channel 4’s Eurotrash, with Antoine de Caunes. The French designer recently turned 70, and his wild, eventful life will be celebrated in a song-and-dance cabaret, Fashion Freak Show, at the Roundhouse in London this summer. Have you always had a strong connection with the UK?Yes! The first time I came to England, to London, it was like somewhere very close to Paris, but completely different. The people, the architecture, the weather, the spirit. It was beginning of the 1970s, so I saw Tommy the movie, The Rocky Horror Show, the punks. For me, it was something incredible; nobody else but the English could do something like that. I love the eccentricity and the freedom. Whereas in France we are a little bourgeois: there’s no sense of humour, no sense of self-criticism. You have always to be so nice and so elegant. Truly, I hate that, and I love that in England there is a contrast: fantasy is completely accepted. Was there anything about the UK you didn’t like?At the beginning, the food was not good. Now it’s very good – it has been for many years – but before it was only Indian and Chinese restaurants where it was OK. The rest was absolutely disgusting. But it changed, everything changed, so now you have the perfect 12 points to England. No, that is wrong that they didn’t give you any points for Eurovision. You’re a big Eurovision fan. Why have the UK done so badly in recent years?It’s sad but it’s politics. Because OK, the 2021 song [James Newman’s Embers] was not one of the greatest, but it was not that bad. And to make zero, I think it’s because of Brexit or something like that, which is quite disgusting. You were already very well known as a fashion designer when you started presenting Eurotrash in the 1990s. Was that a fun break from your day job?My first collection was in 1976, and in 1990 my boyfriend [Francis Menuge] died. And that truly was a moment where I felt I was missing one arm, or two arms actually. So I had the proposition of Antoine de Caunes [to present Eurotrash in 1994] but I tell him: “I am not a presenter. I don’t know how to speak.” And he says: “No problem. You just have to be yourself.” Bon, which was meaning maybe the gay one! So after I realised that it was him and me, but very French, so: let’s do it. And I think it was funny. More recently you have been a judge on the French version of Strictly Come Dancing…Oh, that was a big mistake. I don’t regret it but I didn’t like it. I thought I should have loved to do it, because I have been a fan some time of the programme, but you had to critique [the dancers] and give some advice, which is not my cup of tea. They have to do what they feel, and I am not able to say technically what they have to do. After 50 years in the business you presented your final haute couture show in 2020. Do you miss fashion?Oh, not at all, no! I like to do things about fashion but I don’t want to do fittings any more. So if somebody asks me to make an exhibition about a subject like denim or corsetry, I would love to do that. And that’s why I did the Fashion Freak Show, because I was getting to 50 years of fashion and I like to express myself about it. What should the audience expect from the Fashion Freak Show?For the show, they will see a little of my life. Actually, not a little, but it’s my life without the detail, explaining how a little boy, from a very good grandmother, dressed his teddy bear with the conic bra when he was seven years old, long before Madonna! Madonna famously wore that conical bra on her 1990 Blond Ambition tour. Is it true that you proposed marriage to her?Oh yes, two or three times. But always no, no, no. What would you have done if she’d said yes?I would have realised, I suppose: “Oh my God, what did I ask?” She was such a strong woman. I remember the first time I saw her: it was on Top of the Pops and she was singing Holiday and I thought she was English. I remember thinking: “Oh that one, she’s good, how she dresses, and the music is nice, I like her.” But she was American! I was surprised that an American can dress like that. Throughout your career you picked unconventional models, with diverse ages and body types. Did that feel radical when you did it?I wanted to show that there is a lot of beauty in difference. There is not only one type of beauty. I have always loved difference – maybe because I was different myself, in some way. So I didn’t want the models that were so professional. I prefer to see girls that I saw in a club, like for example in Le Palace [the Studio 54 of Paris], which is where the French punks went. I didn’t want Parisian chic. I wanted the opposite girl: the modern girl. Your clothes are a big part of the current revival of 90s fashion, being worn by the likes of Zendaya and Kendall Jenner. Do you feel proud that your work remains relevant?Very proud. It means that I didn’t make mistake! But also I didn’t make only fast fashion, fashion that only lasts one season, things that come and go. And I have pleasure to see that. Even though I don’t want to make any more collections myself, my idea to take a different designer each season [to reinterpret Jean Paul Gaultier designs] is going very well. I see even the wife of Willy Smith was wearing one of the dresses, the green dress is a Gaultier with [Y/Project’s] Glenn Martens. The dress Jada Pinkett Smith wore at the Oscars?Yes! Normally in theatre, green is bad luck. [Laughs] But he wins the award!

5/15/2022,"To a generation of 21st-century cricket fans, Andrew Symonds was a real-life action hero. He had Superman’s physique, Batman’s mystery, The Hulk’s power and The Flash’s agility. Little wonder cricket-mad kids worshipped him across three decades. With a few swings of his bat, an over of crafty medium pace or off-spin, or a spectacular leap, dive and throw in the field, Symonds could turn a game on its head. He was a gifted athlete, a born entertainer and a reluctant celebrity. Most of all, a true allrounder, on and off the field. The news of his death is tragic. He leaves behind a wife, two children and a legacy of greatness. Symonds was born in Birmingham in 1975, two days after the first Cricket World Cup kicked off in London. His parentage was a mix of Afro-Caribbean and Swedish or Danish blood. Although he was adopted at 12 weeks old by school teachers Ken and Barbara Symonds, and emigrated to Australia soon after, his instinctive brilliance as a junior cricketer fed a mythology which passed from town to town, over rivers and down coastlines about the big boy wonder whose father drove him 270km twice a week to bat and bowl the house down for the Townsville Wanderers, a club whose bucolic home ground was 50km from where Symonds’s rolled car was found by police in the wilds of Hervey Ranges, west of town. Although he made his first-grade debut in 1994-95, scoring more than 5,000 runs and taking more than 100 wickets, Symonds came of age in his UK birthplace, bludgeoning his name into county cricket infamy with several rousing innings including a famous 254 against Glamorgan in 1995 that included 16 sixes (and just as many pints afterwards). Such feats of power and instinct saw England rattle his cage to claim his Pommy birthright and defect. They even picked him in an England A side. But not for the last time, Symonds went his own way, defecting to his homeland. If Shane Warne was Australian cricket’s most brilliant larrikin, Symonds was its wildest colonial boy, more at ease mud-crabbing or deep sea-fishing than playing organised cricket with its traditions, rites and passages and pressure tests. He famously showed up to a contract negotiation with the suited chieftains of Australian cricket wearing double-pluggers and a mud-and-salt-encrusted Akubra, swinging into the driveway with crates of crayfish on the back of his ute, some fat barramundi on ice and half a dozen empty cans at his feet. Australia’s hero of that 1975 World Cup had been another burly showman, Gary Gilmour. But like ‘Gus’ Gilmour, ‘Roy’ Symonds never settled into his groove as the allrounder Australia had craved since the late Keith Miller sheathed his rapier, hung up his comb and went to the races. Although he wore the green and gold in 1999 and showed glimpses of the pyrotechnics for which he became famous, Symonds did not fulfil his promise until 2003 when he lit up that year’s World Cup with a pulverising and unconquered 143 not out in the opening game against Pakistan, steering his depleted side from 86-4 to 310-8 and setting in train the juggernaut that won Australia the tournament and made Symonds a lock in the ODI side. A Test debut came the next summer but at first he looked ill at ease in white. There was none of the swagger he carried into the short-form game, where canny captains like Ricky Ponting knew not to assign him a role but merely turn him loose. Symonds struggled on that first Sri Lankan tour in 2003-04 then underachieved against the West Indies. His frustration showed in some loose off-field behaviour. It was a pattern that repeated throughout his career and it cost him Test caps – but never fans. After five Tests, he had a batting average of 12.62 and a bowling average of 85.00. But with critics calling for his head, Symonds showed his mettle on the biggest stage of all, the MCG and the 2005 Boxing Day Test against South Africa. After a golden duck in the first innings, he blazed 72 off 54 balls in the second dig, including a new Australian record for the fastest Test 50 (40 balls) and backed it up with five wickets. But Symonds’s thirst often outweighed his ambition and, after showing up drunk to training or failing to heed wake up calls for the team bus, he was dumped, recalled then dumped again. In the coming years, Symonds would speak of his problems with binge drinking. For the fourth estate, he was manna – enigmatic, untameable and unaffected. As a young cricket editor, I waited three days for an interview with Symonds only to get a better headline when he and fellow Queensland outdoorsman Matthew Hayden were rescued from shark-infested seas after their fishing boat sank and left them clinging to an Esky lid. Trying to track him down for an interview was like chasing marlin. Most of the time he was out back and “out of range” and you came back empty. When he appeared, though, it was brilliant. Symonds was gruff and dry, but funny and honest. He laughed like a drain and his smile – a flash between two forever-zinc-creamed lips – could light up a stadium. Symonds’s 2008 season showcased his brilliance, courage, fecklessness and controversy. He kicked it off with an atypically disciplined yet typically dynamic innings of 162 not out against India, taking his side from 134-6 to a final total of 463. In the same test, he took exception to Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh touching teammate Brett Lee. Words were exchanged. Symonds’s remarks were profane, Singh’s were racist. A tribunal intervened but it soured a triumphant game – and ultimately lit the fuse on his last blast. Soon after, Symonds was axed from the Australian side after he missed a team meeting to go fishing. Instead he took a gig in the Indian Premier League worth $1.8m, the second-biggest salary in the league. Shortly after he retired to commentary, family life and chasing the horizon on fishing boats, Symonds explained his drinking to 60 Minutes as a case of “too fast, too much”. It proved a neat distillation of his cricket career too – a whirl of shorts, catches and wickets almost too brilliant for the eye to see from a talent who always defied convention and sometimes belief. Andrew Symonds is dead. But to his friends and fans he lives on. He’s simply gone fishing.",Sport/Sport,Andrew Symonds was a born entertainer and a reluctant celebrity | Angus Fontaine,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/15/andrew-symonds-was-a-born-entertainer-and-a-reluctant-celebrity
5/15/2022,"“The truth is,” says Ansel Elgort as journalist Jake Adelstein in an early episode of Tokyo Vice (Starzplay), “I don’t know what I’m doing.” Most people don’t know what it’s like to be the first American reporter to work the crime beat on a major Japanese newspaper, or indeed to end up entangled in a gang war as a consequence, but the feeling that sets this drama in motion is near-universal. Here is a story of people in their 20s, alone in a big city, thrilled to be making their own way but with no real idea how to do it. The city is Tokyo at the end of the 1990s and Jake is based on a real person – Adelstein’s memoir is the basis for this series created by playwright JT Rogers, and directed, for the first episode at least, by Michael Mann. The Hollywood veteran brings the brooding noir shimmer of his 2004 movie Collateral to early scenes, which set Adelstein up as a pale tyro, driven and self-sufficient, with the cocky glint of an academic high-achiever still in his eye. He practises aikido, teaches English charismatically to a room full of nervous housewives, knowledgeably orders “liver, leek and chicken thigh” at a cafe thronging with locals, loses himself dancing at a club and studies the capital’s organised crime activity by night, cross-legged on the floor in his flat above a shop. Tokyo feels like it’s his and, when he passes a supposedly forbidding Japanese language test to get a job writing news for the biggest paper in town, young Jake has a chance to prove it. Thanks to one of those opening flash-forwards that suggests the show isn’t totally confident it can hold our attention, we know where this will end up: Adelstein attends a meeting with high-ranking yakuza, is warned by a man in a knife-sharp suit that writing up the story he’s working on will bring death, and responds with a calm that says he feels he’s this kingpin’s equal. Before then, though, is the story of a cub reporter who must learn his trade the hard way. And so Tokyo Vice proceeds, with a naive recklessness about tripping over cliche that is easy to find endearing, to run through Jake’s evolution from fizzing rookie to journalistic force. His first few stories are either rewritten or spiked altogether, his less welcoming colleagues refer to him as gaijin (foreigner) or worse, “Mossad”, and his maverick refusal to go along with the accepted protocol – stick to the facts, which are what the police tell you they are – earns him regular dressings down. At one point an irate editor literally shouts: “You don’t get to think! You will follow the rules!” Wilfully pursuing the idea that a death by sword impalement and a shocking public self-immolation are both connected to the work of underground loan sharks, Jake dissects each knockback or minor breakthrough with two fellow trainees, as they inhale beer and noodles at a series of enviably vibrant bars. It’s a heady gambol through a convincingly realised Tokyo, and Elgort is comfortable as the protagonist, mixing the raw verve he showed in West Side Story with the quiet capability of his character in Baby Driver. But then Jake meets a girl, and Tokyo Vice is no longer just Elgort’s show. The girl is Samantha (Rachel Keller), who works as a “hostess” in an expensive but seedy bar, employed to titillate the male customers into buying overpriced champagne. Another American abroad whose fluent Japanese indicates that she fled her birthplace at the first opportunity, she is savvier than Jake and, probably, romantically out of his reach, especially since she’s also a favourite of the bar’s scariest patron, intense young yakuza enforcer Sato (Shô Kasamatsu). Jake, Samantha and Sato – a gangster who has the violent urges necessary to ascend in his organisation, but is disturbed by them and disgusted by his lairier fellow foot soldiers – are alike, all cleverer than the people around them but unsure of where to point their ambition. As Jake also forms a bond with a paternal vice cop (Ken Watanabe, whom the show boldly hardly uses for the first two episodes), who gives him the headline-worthy leads he craves, Tokyo Vice becomes an ensemble drama that struggles to keep up the momentum of its multiple storylines, and in its middle episodes misses the menace of that Mann-directed opener. For a show that’s meant to be a journey into the criminal underbelly of a darkly thrumming metropolis, Tokyo Vice maintains a surprising innocence, staying cute and soft, like Elgort’s baby face. It doesn’t know quite what it’s doing.
