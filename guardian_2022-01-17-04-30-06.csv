1/17/2022,"England kept their hopes of a first Quad Series title alive after overcoming an eight-goal deficit to defeat New Zealand 49-46 and book their spot in the final. After losing a first international series to the Roses back in September, and then being hammered on Saturday at the hands of old foes Australia, just how New Zealand were going to approach England was a point of intrigue. That question was quickly answered.  Physical, breathless, the first 15 minutes packed a punch. Bodies bounced off bodies as New Zealand quickly took ownership of space, a familiar modus operandi from the Ferns. Twisted frames and tightly delivered bounce passes forced England into an unwanted thinking game. Though Saturday’s player of the match Layla Guscoth showed flashes of class it did little in the face of the New Zealand defence running riot in their third. In a matter of moments, the Roses trailed by six. When it looked like everything was going New Zealand’s way, and no doubt how Dame Noeline Taurua intended, something not even the Ferns’ head coach could control took over. Seeing their side down by eight the Copper Box crowd intervened. Voices cried, inflatable sticks slapped together and, on cue the Roses shifted gear. Drawing on the energy of their surroundings, England found their feet and began delivering the kind of netball that has seen them be so successful. Sharp angles, tight defence and with the late introduction of England’s most-capped player Jade Clarke, New Zealand were muted. Their goal margin disappeared and the score at half-time was poised at 25-25. It is no secret that the biggest challenge ahead for the head coach Jess Thirlby is Commonwealth Games selection. With squad depth not ever seen in England’s history what each player can offer will factor heavily in her decision-making. Not going down without a fight, the 38-year-old Clarke made her strongest bid yet for a spot in the 12. Taking on the mantle of centre, Clarke released the England skipper Serena Guthrie to wing defence and the new combination proved fundamentally decisive to the game’s outcome. “That was a big turning point for us,” said the captain after the match. In the third quarter the two players, with their combined 10 years of international netball experience, allowed England to clinch the lead. The goalkeeper Eboni Usoro-Brown and Guscoth, thriving off the output of the Clarke-Guthrie pendulum in front of them, continued to pick off ball keeping the Roses ahead as things went toe-to-toe. The never-say-die Ferns continued their pursuit deep into the fourth quarter, but the Roses did not relinquish control. The stalwart Helen Housby, shooting at 96% throughout the game, gritted her teeth as the New Zealand defence desperately pressured her but not even their best efforts could stem her impact. As the buzzer sounded signalling the onslaught was over, the Box cheered in approval – the Roses were finals bound. “It’s not ideal to go down obviously,” said Guthrie. “We had to really fight to get back. Ideally, we want to get in the game earlier and stay up in the game but sometimes you’ve got to play what’s in front of your face. I was just really proud of the team effort today.” Next up for England is Australia. The world No 1 team, like the Roses, are two from two and Thirlby was thankful for Sunday’s encounter ahead of Tuesday’s challenge. Thirlby said: “The way that we’ve had to play that game and the way in which New Zealand forced us to play a little bit is a great preparation for a match against the Diamonds.”",Sport/Sport,Clarke inspires England to comeback victory to reach Quad Series final,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/16/clarke-inspires-england-to-comeback-victory-to-reach-quad-series-final
1/17/2022,"Perhaps the strangest aspect of Rafa Benítez’s time at Everton is how well it began. He may have been sacked after a dismal run of one win in 13 league games, but after seven league games Everton had 14 points, a better start than they’d had last season, when everybody was cooing about Carlo Ancelotti and James Rodríguez.  But the problem was that Benítez is Benítez and a significant part of that identity is bound up with Liverpool. Whatever Benítez’s qualities as a coach, he was never likely to be afforded much patience by fans if things went badly. Benítez will probably argue he was undone by a series of key injuries, most notably Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Yerry Mina, while Abdoulaye Doucouré has not been the same since his foot problem. Any side would be affected by the loss of its spine, but in Everton’s case, those absences exposed deeper-lying, almost existential issues. This is a club locked in a spiral of negativity and, whatever Benítez’s faults, nobody should think that many of the problems did not precede him. What is Everton? Since Roberto Martínez departed in 2016, Everton have decided that none of Ronald Koeman, Sam Allardyce, Marco Silva or Benítez are quite for them. Given Carlo Ancelotti won only six of 19 home games last season, he might have found Goodison Park turning against him had fans been in the ground and there is some suggestion he was coming under internal pressure before jumping ship for Real Madrid. Which poses a major question: given four of the last five managers have been deemed failures almost from the off, are Everton terrible at making appointments, or is there something in the character of the club that makes it essentially unmanageable? For a long time Everton were a club who battled on admirably despite a comparative dearth of resources. Since Farhad Moshiri became the club’s owner in 2016, though, there has been a net spend of a little over £200m. That’s not enough to challenge for Champions League qualification, but even after the tap was turned off this summer, the first year of Moshiri’s reign when a cash profit was made on sales, it is not a level of expenditure that should see the club anxiously glancing over their shoulders at a possible relegation fight. Spotrac suggests Everton have the seventh highest wage bill in the Premier League; it’s a long time since they have played like it. Two timeframes need to be taken into account. In the immediate term, Everton were sinking. Defeat on Saturday to a Norwich side that hadn’t so much as scored in six league games meant Everton have now lost to all three promoted clubs this season and that, understandably, came as the final straw. Was a first relegation in 71 years a serious prospect? Perhaps not, but given how poor their form had become, how shambolic their defending, nobody could claim to be entirely comfortable with just a six-point gap to the drop zone, even with games in hand. Once middle-aged fans are running on to the pitch to berate a manager, the jig is almost certainly up. The sale of Lucas Digne a few days earlier after a falling out with Benítez suggests that there was no plan then to dispense with him but there comes a point in any poor run when the tide of negativity is so powerful that sacrifice is the only possible course of action. So Benítez had to go. But whoever takes over will inherit an odd mishmash of a squad patched together over the reigns of six managers. It’s not that there are not good players there – there are – but too many were bought at or beyond their peak. Of course bargains can be found among those cast off elsewhere, but it feels as though there has been a fundamental failure to accept Everton’s place in the modern world. Cosplaying being a big club has simply wasted money. Clubs like Everton can thrive only by buying young prospects and then selling at a profit. It’s unpalatable, but that’s the reality of the financing of modern football for those who are not superclubs. To do that, though, requires a proper structure and a proper philosophy. Under Moshiri there has been none of that, just a club ricocheting between approaches, from modern Dutch to old-school English to emergent Portuguese to Champions League aristocracy to the dour football of 15 years ago. The people who could have instituted a proper transfer policy, Steve Walsh and Marcel Brands, never seemed entirely happy fits. Walsh left in 2018, Brands in December citing “a clear difference in the vision and direction” with the board. Perhaps Brands wasn’t the right man. Perhaps Walsh wasn’t. Ultimately Benítez clearly wasn’t. But who can be? What direction is there at the club at the moment? A former manager has privately observed that Moshiri is unclear in his own mind, too reactive to the shifting tides of fan and media opinion. But until there is a clear vision it is hard to see how Everton move forward, and that begins with an acceptance of their place in the world.",Sport/Football,Removal of Benítez will not solve all of Everton’s deep-lying problems ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/16/removal-of-benitez-will-not-solve-all-of-evertons-deep-lying-problems
1/17/2022,"Unilever’s rebuffed £50bn takeover offer for GSK’s consumer healthcare venture, which owns the Panadol and Nicorette brands, represents only a modest premium to its current value, according to some leading analysts, suggesting the drugmaker is right to hold out for a higher offer. GSK said on Saturday that it had rejected three bids from Unilever, the consumer goods giant behind brands including Marmite and Lipton tea. The latest offer, made on 20 December, comprised £41.7bn in cash and £8.3bn in Unilever shares.  Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker said the proposals “fundamentally undervalued” the consumer business and its future prospects, and that it remains committed to separate the business from its medical arm and float it on the London Stock Exchange. Analysts have valued it at £45bn, with some estimates as high as £48bn, but takeover offers typically come with an acquisition premium. GSK on Saturday released new organic sales growth forecasts for consumer health of 4% to 6% in the medium term, higher than the 3% to 3.5% analysts have pencilled in. It said it was pushing on with plans for a stock market flotation this summer. Jefferies analyst Peter Welford said: “A £50bn bid reflects a modest 10% acquisition premium, with Unilever gaining control of a leading global consumer healthcare business and likely able to realise significant synergies. We acknowledge post-spin there will be standalone costs that depress returns, but also greater freedom to allocate capital which could boost future growth prospects.” On the other hand, he noted that a £50bn-plus sale would leave GSK £34bn-plus cash for its 68% stake. “In theory this war chest provides ample strategic optionality to rebuild a pipeline and invest in focus therapeutic areas, but at least initially we expect many shareholders would fear a large acquisition and the risk of inferior returns.” GSK has been under pressure from the activist investor Elliott Management, a New York hedge fund, to pursue a sale of the consumer business. Elliott took a sizeable stake in GSK last spring to clamour for change at the pharmaceutical company ahead of its planned split, including demanding that chief executive Emma Walmsley reapply for her job. GSK has firmly resisted the hedge fund’s demands. Unilever issued a statement on Saturday that left the door open for a further approach. “GSK Consumer Healthcare is a leader in the attractive consumer health space and would be a strong strategic fit as Unilever continues to re-shape its portfolio.” Russ Mould, investment research director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “GlaxoSmithKline has a plan of action that it has clearly outlined for some time, so I doubt it feels under pressure to consummate a deal. The fact that management feel capable of waiting for a better price suggests as such, although they do have an obligation to shareholders to get the best possible price that they can, either via the spin-off or sale.”",News/Business,Analysts say GSK is right to rebuff £50bn offer for consumer healthcare venture,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/16/analysts-say-gsk-is-right-to-rebuff-50bn-offer-for-consumer-healthcare-venture
1/17/2022,"David Moyes hit out at the Premier League for making West Ham play three times in a week after Leeds United dented his weary side’s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.  West Ham were unhappy after their rearranged fixture against Norwich City, which was postponed last month, was played last Wednesday. Moyes had hoped he would get a free week following the busy festive period and he felt that his side, who were without five players, suffered because of the schedule. “We did not agree with why we had to play Norwich when we did,” West Ham’s manager said. “We missed one game and not by our doing and we were made to go again at this point in the season. We had a busy Christmas period like everybody else, like Leeds, but Leeds have two games to play, and were not asked to play midweek. “I cannot understand it and it only tells me that the people making those decisions do not understand what recovery means, what it means to play games on a regular basis and the people putting the games are getting that wrong for sure.” Moyes was reluctant to say whether the rules are being abused after Arsenal’s game against Tottenham was postponed yesterday. “I don’t really care about that,” the Scot said. “Maybe we are not being tough enough, maybe I am not being tough enough in saying we could have done with the game against Norwich being off and we could have fought harder for it. “Maybe I will have to do that in the future because it put us under pressure to play today. Leeds had a full week to prepare. But it is done and I can’t put the result solely down to that. It is down to us not playing well, making mistakes, missing chances.” West Ham, who remain fourth, were cut apart by a Jack Harrison hat-trick. Leeds, who moved nine points above the bottom three, were missing nine players due to injury and suspension, but their manager Marcelo Bielsa said that he did not consider asking for a postponement. Bielsa, who filled his bench with academy products, also saw Junior Firpo and Adam Forshaw limp off in the first half. “There are rules to ask for that type of thing and we did not meet the criteria sufficiently to ask for a decision of that kind,” he said.",Sport/Football,David Moyes hits out at Premier League schedule after West Ham lose to Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/16/david-moyes-west-ham-leeds-premier-league-schedule
1/17/2022,"Scotland’s largest-ever auction of permits to construct offshore windfarms is expected to raise up to £860m when the results are announced on Monday. Crown Estate Scotland, which is running the auction, hopes that windfarms with as much as 10 gigawatts of new generating capacity will be built over the next decade, effectively doubling the amount of electricity generated in Scottish waters in a transition which has the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs.  The programme, known as ScotWind, has attracted frenzied interest from domestic and international bidders, and could set new records for values placed on the plots of seabed being leased for turbines. In the first ScotWind leasing round, 8,600 sq km of Scottish seabed is on offer across 15 areas, enough to develop windfarms which could power every Scottish household and save more than 6m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. The windfarms could more than double the capacity built or planned in the seabed around Scotland over the coming decade. At the moment, offshore windfarms in Scotland generate about 1GW. Projects that have received consent and those being built amount to less than 10GW. The Moray East windfarm has become Scotland’s biggest source of renewable energy, generating up to 950 megawatts from 100 turbines. It will be overtaken by Seagreen next year with 1GW of capacity. Located around 27km off the Angus coast, the £3bn windfarm is a joint venture between Perth-based SSE Renewables (49%) and France’s TotalEnergies (51%). The winning bids – and the prices paid – are expected to be announced at 10am on Monday. Crown Estate said in July that 74 offers had been submitted for ScotWind. Many come from consortiums. Among them is Denmark’s largest energy company Ørsted, which pioneered the first ever offshore windfarm in 1991 and has teamed up with Italy’s Falck Renewables and the floating wind expert BlueFloat Energy. Other bidders include renewable energy investment funds such as Australia’s Macquarie Bank Green Investment Group, which has partnered with the Scottish offshore wind developer Renewable Infrastructure Development Group; big utility companies involved in existing projects, such as SSE and Scottish Power; and large oil companies, including Shell, France’s Total, Italy’s ENI and Norway’s Equinox. Crown Estate Scotland lifted the cap for the auction bids from £10,000 to £100,000 per sq km last year. If every bid is submitted up to that maximum cap, the sale could raise £860m. Melanie Grimmitt, global head of energy at the law firm Pinsent Masons, said this leasing round had shown that there was significant appetite for investment from within the UK and abroad, which bodes well for a second ScotWind seabed leasing round later this year. “This is crown state Scotland’s first seabed leasing round and marks an important chapter for Scotland’s offshore market, but with proposed windfarms from the leasing round expected to save in excess of 6m tonnes of carbon emissions, it is also an important milestone for the UK’s overall net zero commitments,” she said. “Developers will be keeping an eye out to see if and how the application process and criteria for the next round might differ from this one given how popular and competitive it has been.” Crown Estate Scotland is a separate organisation to the crown estate, which manages the Queen’s assets in England and Wales, and its profit is passed to the Scottish government. Some of the proceeds are expected to be ploughed into preparing the workforce for the switch from North Sea oil and gas to wind power. The transition to renewable energy means that as fossil fuel jobs disappear, thousands of workers will need retraining.",News/Environment,Scottish auction for offshore windfarm permits expected to raise £860m,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/16/scottish-auction-for-offshore-windfarm-permits-expected-to-raise-860m
