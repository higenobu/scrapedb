2/14/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are today’s top stories.  A diplomatic offensive by western governments to avert a Russian invasion of Ukraine was stepped up again this morning as Downing Street said Boris Johnson would travel to Europe later in the week for talks with allies, and German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, was due to land in Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian president. No 10 said the prime minister would be working to bring Russia “back from the brink” and was also said to be working with allies to provide further defensive and economic support to Kyiv. The immediate diplomatic focus was on Scholz, who is expected to discuss with Volodymyr Zelenskiy how Germany could help stabilise Ukraine’s economy after fears of an imminent war took a toll on its currency. Scholz said on the eve of his departure that any Russia attack would lead to “tough sanctions that we have carefully prepared and which we can immediately put into force”. He will fly to Moscow to meet Vladimir Putin tomorrow. The urgency was highlighted by sharp falls on stock markets when the trading week started in Asia on Monday, with more selling expected in Europe and Wall Street later. Oil soared to a seven-year high of $95.46 a barrel overnight. Dozens of western diplomats in Kyiv were preparing to leave the city last night as many countries issued a clear warning to all citizens still inside Ukraine to get out before any Russian invasion. Governments of 39 countries have warned against travel to Ukraine. US security officials believe a Russian invasion is “imminent”, while UK intelligence services believe their Russian counterparts at the FSB have been tasked with trying to engineer coups in Ukraine’s major cities to coincide with an invasion. The front pages of the UK papers struck an ominous tone on Monday morning. Health inequality – Widespread racial inequality is embedded in healthcare in England and radical action is needed urgently to fix the problem, according to a damning study which found that the problem was harming the health of millions of patients. Racism, racial discrimination, barriers to accessing healthcare and woeful ethnicity data collection have “negatively impacted” the health of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in England for years, according to the review, commissioned by the NHS Race and Health Observatory. The 166-page report, seen by the Guardian, is due to be published in full this week and should be the cue for long-awaited action. Refugee cost – A coalition of hundreds of pro-refugee organisations has estimated the huge costs of five Home Office policies to block refugees, which are due to become law in a matter of months. Taxpayers could face an extra £2.7bn a year in costs to fund the schemes, the campaign coalition Together With Refugees claims in a report today. The Home Office dismissed the calculations as “pure speculation”, but the SNP MP Stuart McDonald said the research “shows in stark terms what many MPs have long feared about the huge cost to the taxpayer”. Letting go – Nearly 230,000 new rental properties are needed in the UK to avoid a shortfall if the current growth in demand continues. The consultancy Capital Economics reckons demand for 1.8m new households over the next decade will keep pressure on the rental market. Private rents in Britain rose at their fastest rate on record in January and average advertised rent outside London was 9.9% higher than a year ago. Hong Kong’s Covid ‘onslaught’ – Hong Kong is being “overwhelmed” by the latest wave of Covid-19, the city’s leader Carrie Lam said today, as she called in more help from the Chinese government to deal with the crisis. Daily infections have multiplied by a factor of 13 over the past two weeks to more than 1,300 on Sunday, with authorities scrambling to control the deepening outbreak. Lam’s “dynamic zero” Covid strategy has led to growing resentment and possible food shortages. Click here to catch up with all the Covid developments, including rocketing cases in New Zealand. Ivan Reitman, the influential film-maker and producer behind beloved comedies including Ghostbusters, Animal House and Twins, has died at the age of 75. Reitman died peacefully in his sleep on Saturday night at his home in California. Film-makers and comedians lined up to pay tribute with the director of the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot, Paul Feig, writing: “All of us in comedy owe him so very much.” Comedian Kumail Nanjiani tweeted: “A legend. The number of great movies he made is absurd.” You don’t need a partner to have a happy and fulfilling life – so why does society still apply the pressure to couple up?

Eddie Jones believes there is no limit to Marcus Smith’s potential after the England fly-half inspired his side to a comfortable 33-0 Six Nations victory against Italy in Rome. The alpine slalom skier Dave Ryding insists that Britain’s blank medal tally so far at these Winter Olympics has only made him more determined to ride to the rescue by winning gold this week. Kamila Valieva is so talented she does not need to take drugs, her choreographer has insisted, as the brilliant 15-year-old Russian skater waits to see whether she will be sent home from the Beijing Games. David Moyes insisted Kurt Zouma pulled out of West Ham United’s 2-2 draw with Leicester City less than half an hour before kick-off with sickness rather than stress. Pep Guardiola has said he wants Raheem Sterling to sign a new contract at Manchester City but claims any decision over the forward’s future will ultimately be taken by the club. Caroline Weir maintained her record of scoring in every home Manchester derby with a stunning late chip from distance to earn Manchester City a 1-0 win and a crucial three points in the race for the Champions League.

Does this one – multimillionaire Amanda Cronin and formerly homeless film-maker Martin Read become “friends” who explore each other’s lives for a few weeks – offer anything new and substantial on the UK’s great class divide? On the one hand, Read is in full control of a fair production and no one is left exploited.

2/14/2022,"The manipulation of aid by Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria is a unique and persistent form of control that needs to be urgently addressed, according to a new report. Based on interviews with UN officials and humanitarian workers in Syria, the 70-page Rescuing Aid in Syria report has been released by a Washington thinktank, the Centre for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS).  “There aren’t many situations in our history, where someone who has committed mass atrocities to the level that the Assad government has, stays in power and controls the aid apparatus,” said the author, Natasha Hall. The Assad regime has such a tight grip on aid groups’ access, including through visa approvals, that it had become normalised for relatives of senior regime officials to have jobs within UN bodies, the report says. “How could you not know who these people are, when you have their CV in front of you? I find it a dereliction of duty,” one UN official said on condition of anonymity. “This is a massive protection issue, not only for the beneficiaries, but for other national staff you have working with you.” A spokesperson for the United Nations Development Programme said: “The UNDP has found no evidence of having contracted with these entities, nor have we found any records of them in our vendor database. We are nevertheless carrying out a thorough internal review to verify that no such contracting took place either by UNDP or our subcontractors.” The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it “hires its staff based on merit, and on their ability to deliver”. The spokesperson said: “Employees are expected to fully abide with humanitarian principles and the UN code of conduct. All UN staff are required to take an oath to act in the best interest of the UN and not to seek or accept instructions in regard to performance of duties from any government or other source external of the organisation, as mandated by the UN staff regulations.” Relations are warming between the Assad regime and Arab states such as Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Algeria – as well as with the US, which is reworking sanctions in the war-torn country. Meanwhile, the report says, there has been an increase in threats, arbitrary detention and torture of Syrian aid staff in the past year. Employees of one local humanitarian organisation were detained and killed, and their relatives ordered to evacuate their houses or be arrested. The threat of coercion and murder hanging over aid workers prevents independent monitoring of UN agencies and NGOs, the report said.“If the Assad government is going to stay in place, which it seems a lot of governments are resigned to, this needs to be sorted out, because aid is probably going to continue to go into this hostile environment,” Hall said. Beyond the diversion of UN food to the military, people directly responsible for human rights violations are benefiting. The report found Mohamad Hamsho, a businessman close to the Fourth Division, an elite army unit, and the president’s brother, Maher al-Assad, had won UN procurement contracts to strip metals in areas retaken by the government and rework them for sale at his Hadeed Metal Manufacturing Company. “It’s a very perverse cycle that’s being created,” said Hall. The UNDP allegedly contracted the Aleppo Defenders Legion, a pro-regime militia responsible for forcibly displacing residents, to clear rubble and rehabilitate the city they helped destroy, as outlined also by Human Rights Watch. Sara Kayyali, HRW’s Syria researcher, said: “The UN did zero human rights due diligence when contracting people; we’re not talking about them contracting for tens of thousands of dollars, we’re talking about millions of dollars that are going to … companies owned by individuals who we know have committed human rights violations. “When you consider the UN is one of the primary ways that money is going into Syria … [and] plays a huge role in revitalising the economy, it’s playing into the hands of [the regime’s] war economy.” The OCHA spokesperson said the UN’s activities were governed by “core humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence”. They added: “Some governments, such as the one in Syria, insist that UN agencies work with a list of authorised implementing partners. However, we choose our partners from that list based on our own assessments of their capacity to deliver and following due-diligence processes.” When aid was transported across lines of conflict or control, in both north-west and east Syria, known as cross-line shipments, there have been thefts and medical equipment has been distributed haphazardly, the report states. Only 43,500 food portions made it to opposition-controlled north-west Syria in cross-line convoys compared with 1.3m delivered from Turkey in November. Supplies took four months to reach people in need as it sat in warehouses because the regime would not allow opposition-linked NGOs to distribute it, Hall said. The manipulation of aid had grown in the past decade of war, and a thorough audit and evaluation of aid in Syria was necessary, Hall said. “This is part of a systematic issue that needs to be resolved because it will be copied over and over again by other actors … who are learning lessons from what the Syrian regime has done,” Hall said.",News/World news,"Assad regime’s grip on aid agencies in Syria must be addressed, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/assad-regimes-grip-on-aid-agencies-in-syria-must-be-addressed-says-report

2/14/2022,"Kamila Valieva, the 15-year-old Russian skater who lit up the Winter Olympics before her positive drugs test sent shockwaves across the world, has sensationally been cleared to compete in Tuesday’s individual event due to the “exceptional circumstances” of her case. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), which delivered the news shortly before 2pm Beijing time, said that to ban Valieva from competing while her doping case was ongoing “would cause her irreparable harm”.  It also said that the anti-doping rules were unclear when it came to suspended “protected persons” under 16 years of age. As a result it said that Valieva could compete despite the banned angina drug trimetazidine being found in her urine last week. “On the basis of the very limited facts of this case, and after consideration of the relevant legal issues, it has been determined that no provisional suspension should be imposed on the athlete due to exceptional circumstances,” Cas wrote. It then outlined several reasons why Valieva should be allowed to compete, which included the fact that as a 15-year-old the Russian was a “protected person under the World Anti-Doping Code”. It also pointed out the anti-doping rules were “silent with respect to provisional suspension imposed on protected persons”. “The panel considered fundamental principles of fairness, proportionality, irreparable harm and the relative balance of interests as between the applicants and the athletes, who did not test positive during the Olympic Games in Beijing and are still subject to a disciplinary procedure … following the positive test undertaken in December 2021,” the Cas statement added. “In particular, the panel considered preventing the athlete from competing at the Olympic Games would cause her irreparable harm in these circumstances.” The decision came after a lengthy hearing that was conducted by video conference from the temporary Cas offices in Beijing on Sunday night, which was attended by Valieva.

2/14/2022,"Hair stylist Joel McCauley had seen too many colleagues burn out after a perpetual cycle of work, eat and sleep, so when he opened his own salon in Cardiff he was determined to do things differently. Staff at Slunks in Morgan Arcade now work a four-day week for no less pay than for working five days. They are happier, more productive and provide a better service, said McCauley.  “When you have more time, you can think about life in a different way,” he said. “At work, you’re likely to have more energy and fewer non-productive days. Outside work, you can be a better person, a better parent, a better member of the community. I feel better, staff feel better – we’re all working better.” More people could be working a four-day week across Wales after the country’s future generations commissioner, Sophie Howe, called on Monday for the Welsh government to launch a shorter working week trial. Howe, whose role – enshrined in law – is to protect the interests of future generations, said the public sector should lead the way and inspire other businesses to follow suit. She acknowledged there would be a heavy cost to the public sector in the short term, but argued that it could eventually mean increased productivity and savings for society if it led to a healthier workforce and more cohesive population. Howe said: “It’s clear that following the pandemic, people across Wales are re-evaluating their priorities in life and looking for a healthier work-life balance. “The escalating demands of caring for loved ones due to an ageing population and an increase in mental health issues, exacerbated by working long hours, are just some of the factors that make a shorter working week more appealing. “The working week has not changed for more than 100 years and now seems the perfect opportunity for the Welsh government to commit to a pioneering trial and build evidence for greater change across Wales.” A report by the commissioner and thinktank Autonomy found that about two-thirds of Welsh people would ideally work a four-day week and almost 60% said they would support the Welsh government piloting a scheme to move towards it. The report says moving to a four-day week in the Welsh public sector could be particularly effective as sickness rates are high and giving staff an extra day off could help to tackle this. It says it would foster better cohesion by giving people more time to take part in community groups and projects, and could cut carbon emissions by reducing commuting. It also argues that a shorter working week would especially help women, who have less free time on average than men. The report calculates that if the public sector in Wales moved to a four-day week for full-time workers, an extra 27,000 employees would be needed, which would cost £1bn. If productivity gains were to increase above 10%, the cost of the policy “would quickly become negligible”. Jack Sargeant, the chair of the Welsh parliament’s petitions committee and a supporter of a shorter working week, said: “We work some of the longest hours in Europe and this is clearly detrimental to workers’ lives and, the evidence suggests, to productivity as well. “Those that oppose it make the same tired arguments that opponents of progress have always made. The workplace and our lives are changing. Automation and AI will change it even more. A shorter week would be a great way of giving working people some of the fruits of these changes.” Shavanah Taj, the general secretary of Wales TUC, said: “The fight for decent working hours has always been at the heart of union campaigning. We welcome this call for a shorter working-week trial.” A Welsh government spokesperson said: “We recognise potential benefits in a shorter working week and some businesses in Wales are already expressing an interest in moving in that direction. We are considering the progress of pilots in other countries and examining the lessons Wales can learn.” Chelsea Thompson, 28, a salon manager at Slunks, said she was more focused and content. “I’m commuting less and when I’m in, I’m definitely more focused. Since we started the four-day week, everyone says they’re happier. People feel well-rested, mentally prepared. That extra day is for me. I go for long walks, listen to a podcast, see friends who don’t have weekends off.

2/14/2022,"April may be the cruelest month, but February straight up sucks. This is the “news” that was broken by local reporter Kevin Killeen of St Louis’s KMOX, in a 2016 video segment declaring February “an honest month” because it is one that “doesn’t hold up life any better than it really is”. The segment mixes Killeen’s straight-faced, deadpan local news delivery with an almost avant garde absurdity. At one point, Killeen stands atop a parking garage in St Louis, gesturing at the dark office buildings behind him and says, “Something great happened here but it’s over with.” In a voiceover describing images of the city’s downtown, he declares, “This looks like a place where people who are being punished are sent.”  My East Coast friends this month pic.twitter.com/6IRNbpWFxY When the camera cuts to a shot of bare trees against a gray sky, things get a bit weird – and existential. “The trees that once cheered us, they’re hard to look at this month,” he intones. “It’s as if there is some awful truth out there in the trees. It’s hiding in the branches. Look at them. Something that’s been bothering you for a long time is out there. What is it? You can almost see the shape of it when all the color is gone and life is stripped down to the starkness of February. The segment was a “throwaway piece”, Killeen told me by phone this week, done spur of the moment back in 2016 and largely forgotten. But the video keeps getting rediscovered every February, thrusting the reporter into the spotlight and making him feel, he said, “like Jack and the beanstalk”. “At first it’s like someone singing happy birthday to you because everybody loves you,” Killeen said of the experience of going viral. “But then if they keep singing happy birthday all weekend and you’re like, stop it already.” A general assignment reporter, Killeen also does three two-minute feature stories each week for a “morning drive” series called Whole ’Nother Story. A recent segment featured a story about a chihuahua snatched away by an owl that dropped the dog about an hour away, where some motorists pulled over for a rescue. I asked how Killeen pitched a news segment that essentially amounts to “February sucks”, but it turns out he didn’t pitch it at all. The video is one of about five he experimented with before returning to audio when the logistics of pulling off video features while also covering City Hall and crime proved to be too burdensome. The parking structure he stood on is the one he parks his car in every morning. The umbrella he tosses to great comedic effect was “absolutely organic”, he says. “I saw the umbrella as I was going into the office thinking, ‘Oh, I gotta do one of those crummy videos today.” In the video, the busted green and pink floral umbrella that has been abandoned, still opened, atop a garbage bin in the parking garage, becomes a totem for February. “This says it all,” Killeen remarks to the camera. “Somebody on this February day has abandoned it with its broken shaft like a desperate flinging off of something that’s not true any more. The expedition is getting desperate. People are throwing things aside.” He credits KMOX with always giving him a lot of editorial freedom to explore and be playful and said the popularity of the video should be “a lesson to news editors”. “They don’t know half the things their people could create for them if they just let them be creative,” he said. “News editors are always saying what’s on the wire, or what’s on the New York Times, when they could be asking, what can you not stop thinking about? What have you been talking about at parties?” How much they hate February, apparently. “You ever have that feeling that something’s bothering you, but you don’t know what it is? It feels like you could almost get up to the point to see what’s wrong with life itself,” he elaborated. But we can’t: “It’s an elusive target.” What about February being an “honest” month? Does that mean there are months that are not to be trusted? Killeen answers with zero hesitation. “December, with all the vanities of the holiday season.”",News/Media,February sucks.

2/14/2022,"In 1995, the celebrated Indian film-maker Saeed Mirza made a film called Naseem. Set in Agra, a town in Uttar Pradesh, between June and December 1992, it portrays the lead up to the demolition of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya by rightwing Hindu organisations, led by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The film’s titular character asks her grandfather why he did not go to Pakistan at the time of partition. He says: “Your grandmother loved the neem tree in the back yard.” In the middle of the partition riots of 1947, when thousands of Muslims were being massacred in India, as were Sikhs and Hindus in Pakistan, Naseem’s grandmother was so emotionally connected to the neem tree, to the mother Earth, that she would rather take the risk of being killed than leave. One hundred and twenty-five miles from Agra, in Delhi, my father, Haneef Hashmi, also refused to go to Pakistan during the riots. He was a student leader, a freedom fighter, and had spent years in the British jail. He refused to leave India, despite an attack on his family, because he believed in the idea of a diverse, democratic secular country, which was not formed on the basis of religion but on the principles of fraternity, equality and justice.  The most important things I learned during my childhood were compassion, love and, later, rationality. My parents loved kitchen gardening, planting all kinds of fruit trees in our home’s little garden space. When a snake ate our chickens, we all cried for hours. Years later, in the 90s, hate campaigns started again across India. Today, when asked what story my body wants to share with the world, there is only one answer I can give: the story of the capturing of the mind. To me, the most important part of the body is the mind: not the eyes, not the ears, not the nose, not the vagina, not the bosom. If minds are controlled and polluted, then everything else can be destroyed. After India attained freedom in 1947, people taught their children the meaning of love, peace, living together, studying, building the nation and working for progress. But those who were opposed to the idea of a diverse, peaceful India kept spreading hatred, targeting and othering sections of the society on the basis of caste, religion, region, sexuality, telling lies a hundred times over until they seemed like the truth. Today, they have captured power; they have captured the minds of a large section of the population and filled it with hatred. My mind, the most important part of my body, is restless. It is in grief. And it wonders when the people of my beloved country will relearn compassion and how to love others again.

2/14/2022,"Hopping on stage in a cropped grey hoodie and baggy blue sweatpants, Melanie C arrives at the first night of her solo UK tour like she’s entering the ring. Bouncing from foot to foot, the pop star best remembered as Sporty Spice launches with fierce intensity into Who I Am, the disco-inflected opener from her 2020 self-titled album. At 48, Melanie C retains the energy that bestowed her her 90s band nickname. Flanked by drums and keys, she pounces across the stage, adding flourishes of fist pumps, shimmies and jumping jacks to her high-energy tracks about self-love. “It’s a going out album, not a sitting in album,” she chides. It’s not long before her hoodie is flung off – as well as her shoes – and she takes an adoring audience back in time with a rendition of her 2000 No 1 hit, Never Be the Same Again.  In front of a pulsing screen of neon pinks and blues, Melanie C weaves with nimble ease between her early R&B solo singles and the invigorating nu-disco of her most recent album. Accompanied by minimal onstage instrumentation, she sings over a backing track; it’s a shame she’s not on tour with supporting singers to better accentuate her own vocal performance. But the intimacy of a club-night set suits the pop star’s queer icon status and feelgood pop advocacy.

2/14/2022,"What do poets talk about when they talk about love? The first poem I ever wrote was a love poem. I was 14. I don’t remember any of the lines but I do remember it expressed a sickly, naive, messy soup of feelings. It was obsessional, devotional, incantatory – all those things that form a part of romantic love. Its emotions were outsize, its imagery floral and baroque. Very probably, the colour of the addressee’s hair was compared to something in nature, and their complexion to a rose. The addressee was someone specific, with whom I was convinced I was in love. This would be embarrassing to admit – or at least more embarrassing – if it weren’t so commonplace. But penning love poems is one of the great human pastimes. They are central in the so-called canons of global literature. They’ve been around for as long as love itself, for as long as there has been language to describe love. Haven’t you written one, at some point? My first love poem was addressed to someone, a “you”. More importantly, it was told through an “I”. It expressed feelings or emotions from a personal point of view – it was a lyric poem. These have their origins in antiquity and continue unabated today. Sappho circa 600BC: “You came and I was crazy for you / and you cooled my mind that burned with longing.” Lil Nas X in 2021: “Call me by your name / Tell me you love me in private / Call me by your name / I do not care if you’re lying.”  What poets talk about when they talk about love has little to do with the “you” and almost everything to do with the “I”; with the fantasies that the speaker of the poem has created and perilously, thrillingly projected on to the beloved. Lil Nas X freely admits that he doesn’t much care about the subjectivity of his beloved – he cares about his personal fantasy of possessing, or being possessed by, the beloved. The poet Anne Carson summarises this in Eros the Bittersweet: “The people we love are never just as we desire them. The two symbols never perfectly match. Eros is in between.” Eros is poetic rocket fuel, the electric current that surges through and animates so much love poetry. It transforms that lyric “I” into an axis around which all love’s erratic, inconsistent feelings revolve: pleasure and pain, adoration and contempt, devotion and hatred. Carson explains that Eros is the reach of desire, and that this “involves every lover in an activity of the imagination”. The mid-century American poet Jack Spicer, whose work has recently enjoyed a renaissance, understood this intimately. His own Love Poems conclude: “Eros / Do that. / I give you my imaginary hand and you give / me your imaginary hand and we walk / together (in imagination) over the earthly ground.” Eros also depends, entirely, on lack. To actually attain the beloved is to extinguish desire, to “cool the mind” as Sappho says. It is, possibly, to end the love poem altogether. Rachel Long neatly encapsulates this in Thanksgiving, from her debut collection. To keep her lover’s desire running, the speaker understands that she has to maintain an illusion of lack: “I will be so light / upon his life he won’t realise / he’s kept me.” Conversely, to lose or let go of the beloved is to pitch headlong, again, into Eros, a return where pain is redoubled. As Sharon Olds puts it: “I let him go, I lay and stretched on love’s / fucking stretcher.” When I was 20, and still writing bad love poems, I was introduced to Richard Siken’s 2005 collection, Crush. It was actually loaned to me by a “crush” of my own. Siken’s poems, as the title suggests, are intoxicating and luscious, pulverising and shattering: “Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us.” After returning the book to its owner, I’d look for Crush in bookshops, rereading the poems but never buying it. I still do this. It’s as though the book itself has assumed the characteristics of the beloved, in my imagination. To attain it might extinguish the charge the poems hold for me, might extinguish the memory of how and why I first came to read them. What my crush and I loved about Crush, and why it remains a touchstone for today’s generation of love poets, is that the emotions Siken expresses feel so hard-hitting, so urgent. He writes how love and desire really feel. This is what we demand from a love poet. We task them with making love legible, with articulating the quicksilver of desire in a way that elucidates our own. And because what we feel is real, or authentic, the love poem must feel real and authentic, too. But a poem is not some unfiltered explosion of feelings. It is carefully crafted: it is a performance. The lyric “I” is a selective, constructed “I” – the poet’s persona, offering up what Olds called the “apparently personal”. Like Vaseline smeared over the lens of a camera, this lyric “I” casts a weird aura over the poem, folding real life into reverie. To put it another way, we could think of the lyric “I” as a costume the poet wears while performing the poem. The task of the love poem is to perform well enough, authentically enough, that the reader does not dismiss its performance as shoddy artifice but instead permits it to work its magic on them. Is this possible for a love poet today? As readers, we have our hackles up. Our current cultural moment is characterised by charlatanism. Truth and falsehood have become nonsense words, making volatile the meaning of “reality” itself. What’s more, the very language of love – of any emotion, for that matter – risks being cheapened by the forces of advertising and consumerism. I don’t mean the pat Hallmark-ification of love, or the consumerist excess of Valentine’s Day; I mean the deleterious, shapeshifting tactics through which late-stage capitalism divests love and other emotions of any meaning whatsoever. Love today is fungible: it is McDonald’s and Cartier, and the heart-shaped button we tap on Twitter to feed data into the algorithm, spawning targeted ads. Corporations vow to “love” us, their customers; they vow to “care” about our struggles – provided we keep buying. And this is to say nothing of the Eros that lubricates the machine of capitalism itself, deployed to generate desire in the consumer. In this new terrain, can love correspond to anything real at all? The insouciant, offhand poetry of Frank O’Hara remains hugely popular today, outshining many of his New York School contemporaries. A video of O’Hara reading his most famous love poem, Having a Coke With You, has racked up more than half a million views on YouTube. It’s typical of O’Hara’s love poems, which are conversational, casual and peppered with brand names and references to icons of American consumerism. As a poet, O’Hara was wise to an emergent confluence of affect and advertising, of the personal and the product. Although his poems reflect an era of consumerism less steroidal than our own, and so feel cosily nostalgic or dewy-eyed, they hint at a solution to the love poet’s current bind. If love is denuded by the forces of capitalism, maybe the task of the poet today is to integrate the language of capitalism into a new metaphorics of love. “I’m cranking out oodles of love / the way an old spaghetti machine / cranks out spaghetti / baby it’s hard work,” writes Emily Berry in The Old Fuel, brilliantly routing love, undiminished, through a metaphor in which affection is production, and production is labour. Maged Zaher, one of my favourite contemporary poets, elevates these concerns to a formal level. His poems are set in an itinerant world of offices, lunch hours and emails. In a Zaher poem, the syntactic and conceptual sense of an individual line is often undone by bearing no coherent relationship to a subsequent line. “Love in the frozen vegetables aisle / lap-dance security forces,” one poem begins. This technique mirrors the decay of language, the nonsense of corporate speak and political jargon, and the distracted, fitful exhaustion of life under the regime of a neoliberal economy. Love is repeatedly invoked in Zaher’s poems, but he lets it teeter between the possibilities of redemption and failure, sincerity and irony: “So what if you just ate an overpriced burger / It is love that will eventually make a difference.” In doing so, he creates an ambivalent iteration of the contemporary love poem where the reader is forced – or liberated – to decide for themselves whether or not love still has meaning. When I ask myself what poets talk about when they talk about love – when I write my own love poems today – the lyric “I”, Eros, and the twisted language games of advanced capitalism are on my mind. Well, they’re in the junk shop in the back of my mind. My 14-year-old self’s ur-love poem is still rattling around in there, too, saccharine and rose-coloured. There’s something sustaining, or tenacious, about the memory of its adolescent ardour – something, perhaps, that argues for a fundamental unassailability of the heart of love.",Arts/Books,Shall I compare thee to a frozen food aisle?

2/14/2022,"For nearly two decades, Afghanistan’s TV industry developed popular hits, from medical shows and family dramas to Afghan Star, a music competition based on American Idol. Now, nearly six months after the Taliban seized control, many Afghan television and film workers are jobless and in hiding. Some feel abandoned by TV and entertainment industry workers in other countries. A handful of former international colleagues have been fighting to get them to safety, and they say they desperately need more support. (All the names of Afghan TV workers have been changed for this article.)  Rahima, a screenwriter, said she was in the middle of teaching a university class when she learned that the Taliban had entered Kabul. She and a female colleague ran out to buy burkas, only to find the shops already closed. She went home and locked herself inside. She has stayed in hiding for the past five and a half months, she said. “In our neighborhood, everyone recognizes me as a woman activist, the university teacher and TV employee,” Rahima said through a translator. Other former media workers described rushing to scrub their Facebook profiles and concealing or throwing out anything in their house that would link them to the entertainment industry. “They’re hiding their cameras, mics, and booms, every single thing,” said Farjaad, a longtime TV producer based in Kabul. One filmmaker friend buried her camera “in the earth, like a grave”, he said. Abdul, who worked for a decade as an assistant director and producer, now runs a small food stand to support his family, including his ten-month-old baby. Based in a city full of Taliban checkpoints, he is still afraid that someone will recognize him from his work in TV. Fearful of the risk, he sometimes sends his younger brother to run the food stall instead. Sometimes, he said, when he thinks back on the past twenty years of his life, he can’t believe they happened: “Was it sleep? Or a dream? What was that?” “We are looking for help but there’s nobody to help us,” he said. Sayed, who faced multiple threats from the Taliban during years of working in marketing and sales for TV networks, escaped to Pakistan with his family, but is still jobless and feels at risk. “I haven’t heard anything from Hollywood over what is happening with the media people who worked here for twenty years, fighting for the freedom of speech,” he said. “No one from Hollywood, none of the TV or filmmakers, are raising their voice.” Julie Brown, an American development worker, and Muffy Potter, an Australian TV and film producer, said they have been working for months to help their former Afghan colleagues get visas to leave the country. Some of the TV programming the two had worked on in Afghanistan in the early 2010s had been directly funded by foreign governments, such as Eagle Four, a crime drama modelled on 24 that had been publicly identified as an American-funded attempt to increase citizens’ willingness to trust the police. “They helped get a message of democracy, of women’s rights, of governance, to the people, and now they’re left behind living under the regime that they have spent a lot of time doing anti-Taliban messaging about,” said Potter. “When we say, ‘We will stand by you, we have your back, we’ll stand shoulder to shoulder’, that’s an actual person telling an Afghan that, not just a faceless government entity,” said Brown. “We feel like we betrayed them.” Brown and Potter estimated their group of about five volunteers is trying to help several hundred Afghans who are still inside the country, including former colleagues and their family members. “A lot of the ones that are left are the ones that don’t have rich families,” Potter said. “People that don’t have any kind of connections overseas and didn’t have a financial means to seek asylum.” Some have been denied visas, they said. Others have seen their applications held up in the state department’s bureaucracy. Meanwhile, the situation for many former TV workers has only grown more desperate. Since July, Brown said, she has spent time every day working across time zones to get her former colleagues food, secure places to stay, even medical care, including finding a way to get a pregnant woman an emergency C-section. “A lot of them are in danger,” she said. Amid a worsening economic crisis, half of Afghans are facing “extreme” levels of hunger, according to the United Nations. International medical experts have warned of severe shortages of basic supplies at public hospitals. Brown and the other volunteers have crowdfunded and drawn from their own bank accounts to keep support flowing to their colleagues. But, more than six months in, they need more money and visibility, she said. “We need a champion,” she said. “The Screen Actors’ Guild: please, we would love for you to care about our colleagues in Afghanistan.” “I don’t think Hollywood realizes the magnitude of the problem, the difficulties that we have in these evacuation groups,” she added. “I think they think the government is just doing this stuff.” In the first 100 days of Taliban rule, more than 70% of journalists lost their jobs, and at least 250 news outlets closed their doors, according to a report from an Afghan press watchdog this fall. By September, fewer than 100 of Kabul’s 700 female journalists were still working, according to a report from Reporters without Borders. The widespread job losses and shutdowns come from both political and economic pressures. A wide variety of programming, such as music shows and game shows, have been taken off the air, former Afghan TV workers said. Cooking shows need to have male presenters. The Taliban has announced new dress requirements for women onscreen. Approved programming is “simple”, one producer said: “one man, one mullah, sits in the corner, and talks about Islam and talks about traditions”. Comedians are afraid to appear on air, uncertain of which attempted jokes might bring the Taliban to their doors. Radio stations have reported decreases in their number of listeners, as some Afghans fear punishment if they are caught playing music on the radio. At least three people were killed after gunmen opened fire at a wedding in October to stop music from being played. While larger TV stations are still reporting the news, and a few women still appear as correspondents on larger networks, many of the faces are new, as older reporters have fled or gone into hiding, former TV workers said. Violence against journalists, including the vicious beating of two journalists covering a women’s rights protest, has undermined the Taliban’s pledge that it would allow independent media outlets to continue operating. At least 50 journalists and media workers have been detained or arrested over the past six months, according to Reporters without Borders. The growth of Afghan’s media and TV sector over the past twenty years had been a real success story of international development, said Wazhmah Osman, a Temple University professor who conducted years of interviews in Afghanistan about the politics of new television programming. In a country without much internet access or high rates of literacy, TV was an essential medium for cultural discussion, she said. The ordinary Afghans she interviewed were savvy about the role of US and other foreign money in shaping particular shows, but they were also deeply appreciative of the programming, particularly when they felt that local drama had begun to develop some of the polish and sophistication of imported television. Khate Sewom, a scripted series about Afghans from different ethnic backgrounds living together in the same apartment building, had been especially popular, she said. But the flowering of television in Afghanistan had always come at great personal cost to the people who created it, Osman said. Afghan TV workers have been violently targeted for years by the Taliban, Isis, and others. In 2016, a suicide bomber killed seven employees of Tolo, a popular independent TV network, and injured more than two dozen. “No employee, anchor, office, news team and reporter of these TV channels holds any immunity,” the Taliban had declared at the time, calling the networks “satanic”. Firoz, an on-screen host and producer for Tolo, said that the 2016 murder of his friends and colleagues had shaken him, but that he and others decided to stay in their jobs, “because it’s our passion”. He said he “still had hope” at the time that the situation would improve. Today, Firoz, who worked as the face of several US government-funded documentary shows, said he is one of the lucky ones: he was evacuated by Save Our Allies in August, and is now in a refugee facility in Abu Dhabi, waiting for a visa to come to the United States. He thought he might stay in the “humanitarian city” for just a few days. Instead, he has been there for six months, along with at least 9,000 other Afghan evacuees. The mental health of the evacuees is bad, he said, and Afghans there have organized multiple protests against being held “in limbo”, the latest in mid-February. “It’s like a prison,” Firoz said. “We feel like we are prisoners.” Still, he feels safer than his friends in Kabul. Some of them are now “working on the street, selling vegetables”. Farjaaad, who is still in Kabul, says that he feels like a hostage. “We are waiting for a miracle, or a Superman to come and catch us,” he said. Rahima, the female screenwriter, said that the nonprofit for women that she ran is closed, and she can no longer teach at the university. “We are living our darkest days,” she said. “We lost everything we had, everything that we achieved.” “Help me to get out of Afghanistan in any way possible,” she said. “I need a peaceful life.”",News/World news,The Taliban forced Afghan TV workers into hiding.

2/14/2022,"Kaillie Humphries of the United States validated her reputation as one of the best pilots in the history of bobsleigh, surging to victory in the debut of women’s monobob and adding a third Olympic gold to her career haul with a strong chance for a fourth by week’s end. The 36-year-old, who captured two-woman golds with Canada in 2010 and 2014 before joining the US team in 2019, finished with a four-run combined time of 4min, 19.27 sec to win by 1.54sec, the widest margin in any bobsleigh event in 42 years. She becomes the second athlete to win a Winter Olympic title for two different countries, joining short track speed skater Victor An.  Elena Meyers Taylor, the 37-year-old mother from Georgia who put down a scintillating time on her third run to move into bronze medal position, was even cleaner on her fourth descent to claim the silver, finishing 1.32sec behind Humphries and ensuring the United States’ first one-two finish in any Olympic bobsleigh event since 1932. Canada’s Christine de Bruin entered Monday’s final runs in second place but a yawning 1.04sec behind Humphries, by far the biggest halfway lead in Olympic women’s bobsleigh history. She was unable to match Meyers Taylor’s blistering starts and settled for bronze despite a pair of clean runs, coming in 1.76sec off the pace and completing a rare North American podium for the sport. Australia’s Bree Walker completed a memorable Olympic debut with a fifth-placed finish, her country’s best ever performance in bobsleigh. The day amounted to a victory lap for Humphries, whose 130kg sled careened to speeds in excess of 75mph near the bottom of the daunting course known as the Flying Snow Dragon on her third run. She then played it safer on her final trip to bring home the gold by the largest winning margin at an Olympics since Switzerland’s Erich Schärer won the two-man event by 1.57sec in 1980. She sprung from her sled after sliding into the finish area and hoisted an American flag above her head amid chants of “U-S-A! U-S-A!” from the gallery, a third Olympic gold in her possession and the hot favourite to add another in the two-man event later this week. “This one does feel more emotional for me,” Humphries said afterward. “Although each Olympic journey has been different, I’ve had to choose to walk away from my original birth nation. I’ve had to fight. There have been a lot of people that have tried to stand in my way. And there have been a lot of obstacles to get to this point. “And so to know that everybody that supported me and that all the work that I put in has amounted to being the best year, it’s very heartwarming to say the least. It hits the heartstrings a little bit more to know that I chose a nation and it chose me back and that we could do this together as a team.” Humphries and Meyers Taylor, two of the most decorated pilots of their generation, had initially campaigned for the addition of a four-man event to the Olympic programme eight years ago with the intent of offering women the same medal opportunities as men, even driving four-man sleds against men’s teams to make their point. But international officials opted for the addition of women’s monobob instead – where only the driver is in the sled – citing the lack of depth in female bobsleigh programs globally and framing it as a better choice to increase diversity. “This is huge,” Humphries said. “I still remember back in 2002, the first women who won: Jill Bakken and Vonetta Flowers. I hope in the future young girls are going to go, ‘I remember Kaillie’, and then they get involved. They now have two opportunities and hopefully even more opportunities to win more medals in the sport. That’s super cool and I will continue to fight for that. The women before me have allowed this to happen and I want to make sure that continues for all future generations. “This is a huge step forward. By no means do I think we’re done. I really want to see women do four-woman and I would love to see men do monobob as well. Three events for all genders. “To know that in a couple days we get to go back and do this all over again with two-woman, I’m really excited at that challenge and to be able to have that opportunity. So I’m very grateful to everybody who made this event happen and I look forward to all women, long past when I’m retired, being able to have this opportunity to pursue themselves.” The journey to Monday’s podium was anything but a smooth run for both of the women who topped it. Humphries, who is married to an American, joined the US national team after a protracted two-year saga in which she alleged she was verbally and mentally abused by a Canadian official to the point where she no longer felt safe as a member of Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton, the sport’s national governing body. An initial investigation found there was insufficient evidence to support the claims against the official, who denies the allegations. However an arbitrator subsequently found the initial probe “was neither thorough nor reasonable”, and the matter remains under investigation. Meyers Taylor, already the only woman to win three Olympic bobsled medals for the US before Monday’s fourth and the mother of a special-needs toddler, was selected as a flagbearer for Team USA along with curler John Shuster but was forced into isolation after testing positive for Covid-19 upon arrival at Beijing, which limited her opportunities to get to know the course and kept her apart from her two-year-old son longer than ever before. “I came out today knowing I had absolutely nothing to lose,” Meyers Taylor said. “The difference between fourth and 20th wasn’t going to make a difference. All I had to do was lay it all on the line and that’s exactly what I did. I just went out there, enjoyed the heck out of this race and fortunately it paid off.” She added: “Two days ago, I said to my coach Brian Shimer, I sat on one of the containers and said, ‘I don’t even know if I should do this right now’. I was that bad mentally, I was that put out, I didn’t know if I could, I didn’t know if I should. My runs showed it, my runs were just terrible and I just couldn’t clear my head. There was so much fog in my head from everything that had been going on. I was really questioning whether I should come out. Thanks to my team. Thanks to everybody. They lifted me up and they lifted me up to silver medal.” Only five US Olympians have won more medals at the Winter Games than Meyers Taylor’s four: Apolo Ohno (eight), Bonnie Blair (six), Bode Miller (six), Eric Heiden (five) and Chad Hedrick (five).",Sport/Sport,Kaillie Humphries cements status as bobsleigh great with Olympic monobob gold,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/14/kaillie-humphries-cements-status-as-bobsleigh-great-with-olympic-monobob-gold
2/14/2022,"Eviction costs the average renter more than $4,000 and up to 30% of renters in New South Wales will experience it – often through no fault of their own – according to a new report from the NSW Tenants’ Union. The report, titled Eviction, Hardship, and the Housing Crisis, calculated the costs of eviction to the renter, the landlord and the public more broadly. It found that the average cost of a move ranges from $3,215 for a single-person household in greater Sydney through to $5,400 for a family household in regional NSW.  The Tenants’ Union is calling for the NSW state government to abolish “no-grounds” eviction, bolster hardship provisions for renters, and provide landlord insurance, compensation or similar schemes to prevent the need for unnecessary eviction. The call comes as the state’s renters embark on a renewed period of precariousness, with 12 February marking the end of the final phase of the 2021 eviction moratorium, which protected NSW renters from being kicked out of their homes during last year’s lockdown. Moving house was “a significant, traumatic and costly event” that needed to be taken seriously, said the NSW Tenants’ Union chief executive, Leo Patterson Ross. Between 20% and 30% of renters in NSW move due to eviction – that is, because a landlord has terminated the lease agreement, and the renter does not have a choice about whether or not to move out. In many cases, these are no-grounds evictions in which the landlord is not required to provide a reason. Sally, a renter in a regional NSW town who requested a pseudonym as she fears repercussions from her landlord, experienced the trauma of no-grounds eviction first-hand. Her landlord told her in June last year that her lease would not be renewed. Sally departed Sydney four years ago after family court matters meant she had to leave her successful career in the public service. She moved into a three-bedroom house with her three school-age children, with the rent at $500 a week. Despite a substantially reduced income, and the rent taking up between 50% and 75% of her weekly income, she still managed to regularly pay on time. Sally was told over the phone by the real estate agent that they would not be renewing her lease after four years in the property because the landlord wanted to move in. She initially tried to appeal against the decision, fearing it would make her homeless, which would affect the decisions being considered in family court. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “They said, ‘there’s nothing we can do’ and they sent me the official termination notice,” Sally said. Sally spent a month frantically searching for properties – “a month or so of utter, utter stress, because there was literally nothing” – until she heard through a friend about a vacancy with the same real estate agent that had not yet been advertised. It cost more, but it was nearby and she was desperate, so she applied for it and was accepted. “That night after I’d paid a deposit – I hadn’t even packed anything for the move yet – and looked on my phone, and there’s the house I’m leaving advertised for $50 more a week. I nearly vomited,” Sally said. Sally estimated her moving costs at about $3,000, not including the bond for the new house or the amounts she agreed to pay to fix minor damage in the house that did not fall under reasonable wear and tear provisions – “exorbitant rates for everything, because I was so worried about getting things sorted so I wasn’t homeless”. The costs were exacerbated by the forced move during NSW’s hard lockdown, which meant her children were at home from school and her friends couldn’t come and help. The risks of eviction, particularly into homelessness, are especially high for people who are experiencing personal crisis, the NSW Tenants’ Union report found. The report argues that in cases where the landlord has terminated the lease for anything other than a breach of agreement – that is, a “no fault” or no-grounds eviction – the landlord should pay the renter’s moving costs. “No-grounds eviction has such a big impact on renters, particularly when it’s so competitive to find a home, and it has a particularly pervasive effect on the way landlords and tenants relate to each other,” said Patterson Ross. He said eviction had become the default tool for landlords and real estate agents to use to manage a property, even when it wasn’t necessarily in anyone’s best interests to do so. “It doesn’t matter if a no-grounds notice is served; it’s the relationship it creates between tenant and landlord,” Patterson Ross said.",News/Australia news,Calls for end to ‘no-grounds’ evictions in NSW as lockdown moratorium lifts,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/14/calls-for-end-to-no-grounds-evictions-in-nsw-as-lockdown-moratorium-lifts
2/14/2022,"As we have had no snow this year – so far – there are no tracks to reveal which animals have passed this way. I have to look to other means: a fallen feather, footprints in mud, hairs caught in fence wire. A dramatic sight, though, is a dismembered pigeon in the field near our house. Plucked feathers lie scattered in a wide circle like spume on a beach. The head has gone and the flesh has been ripped from the breastbone, leaving only wings and feet splayed on the ground. A drama unwitnessed, it’s a sign that a sparrowhawk has fed.  Only a female sparrowhawk would have taken a bird the size of a pigeon. The male, being smaller, preys on tits, finches or sparrows, not catching anything larger than a mistle thrush. The svelte sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, with its short rounded wings and long tail, is built for quick sprints in woodland, where it can manoeuvre at speed through the trees. Able to turn on a sixpence, it is thrilling to watch as it hurtles through close-set trunks with complete focus. I had heard sparrowhawks calling in late summer as the young learned their way around a nearby wood. A messy nest of sticks will have been built in the dense cover of the lower tree canopy, the female staying tight while the male did all the hunting to feed both her and the chicks. Males are blue-grey above with rufous underparts; females have beautifully barred chests with grey-brown rippling lines rather like a cuckoo. In fact, it is thought that cuckoos evolved plumage to mimic hawks in order to scare their hosts and get easier access to their nests. Returning home at teatime, I round the corner of the house and startle – and am startled by – a sparrowhawk, zooming towards me just two feet from the ground. In that flash of a moment we make eye contact, before the bird veers off in a smooth arc and slips through the narrow gap between the log store and a wall. I stand there, feeling the quivering of air that is all the sparrowhawk has left behind.
