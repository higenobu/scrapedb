3/20/2022,"A murder investigation has been launched after the death of a woman, believed to be 19 years old, at her student flat in London. Police were called to an accommodation block in Clerkenwell for students at City, University of London at 5.10am on Saturday after emergency services received reports of an injured woman. Officers and the London ambulance service attended and found the woman suffering from serious injuries. They attempted to revive her, but she was pronounced dead at the scene at Arbour House, Sebastian Street. No arrests have been made so far and detectives from the Met’s specialist crime command are leading the investigation. The Metropolitan police said on Saturday morning that inquiries were under way to identify and inform her next of kin. The front of Arbour House, a multi-storey block, was taped off and a section of nearby Goswell Road was closed to traffic. Ana, 20, an international student and resident at Arbour House, was in the building when the police arrived. “It has made me feel really uncomfortable, and reminded me that we have to take extra precautions, especially as she was a woman around my age. “Seeing the police was scary at the beginning. We heard all the banging, the police raiding rooms to investigate on the fifth floor. I don’t actually know where they found her, but they were coming into our rooms. “But now it feels a lot safer to have them around while they investigate.” A spokesperson for Unite Students, which runs Arbour House, said: “As this remains an ongoing police incident, we are unable to comment on their investigation. “Our priority at this time is the safety and wellbeing of students at Arbour House. We are working closely with the police and City, University of London.” A spokesperson for City, University of London said: “As a university, we will do everything we can to support our students and staff and we will continue to fully support the police with their investigation. We are working closely with Unite Students who own and operate Arbour House.” A postmortem examination is expected to take place in due course. Anyone with information that could assist police is asked to call the incident room on 020 8358 1010.

3/20/2022,"The decision by David Cameron’s government to ditch what he denounced as “green crap” policies will cost every household as much as £150 a year by the autumn, new analysis has shown. With energy prices already soaring and bills set to rise even further this year, it suggests Cameron’s decisions to effectively end onshore wind projects in England, cut solar subsidies and slash energy-efficiency schemes played a large part in rising bills. It comes with the government preparing to announce its much anticipated energy strategy this week, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further drives up energy prices. It is expected to push measures such as solar and onshore wind power generation, as well as North Sea oil projects. However, there are concerns that the Treasury is holding back more radical action. Many of this week’s measures could reverse action taken by the coalition government. Analysis by Carbon Brief looked at the cumulative effect of ending onshore wind subsidies, cutting energy efficiency funding and scrapping a programme to make all new homes carbon neutral. It also factored in cuts to solar energy subsidies. With the energy price cap already at £1,277 a year and rising to £1,971 in less than a fortnight and an expected £3,000 in October, the analysis found that maintaining the green policies would have reduced energy costs by £8.3bn a year for the economy overall, part of which would equate to £150 a year per household. Dr Simon Evans of Carbon Brief, who conducted the analysis, said: “Cutting the so-called ‘green crap’ has left UK households highly exposed to soaring global gas prices and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Energy efficiency and cheap renewables are the fastest and most effective ways to cut gas imports – and household bills.” Cameron won the Tory leadership by forging an eco-friendly reputation, pictured with huskies on an early trip to the Arctic in 2006 and later installing a wind turbine on his house but reports emerged that he had told aides to “get rid of the green crap” in 2013. At the time that the remarks emerged, Cameron’s team said they did not recognise the phrase, but did not offer an outright denial. Then, a series of policies designed to push energy efficiency and renewable energy was scaled back. The number of homes having their lofts or cavity walls insulated each year dropped by 92% and 74% in 2013 respectively and has never recovered. Subsidies ended for onshore wind turbines, and planning reforms made them harder to build. Meanwhile, solar power was excluded from government support in 2015. Ministers have been battling for weeks to find ways of taking the pressure off energy and fuel costs. Boris Johnson travelled to Saudi Arabia this week to call for cheaper oil prices, while ministers have made clear that onshore wind and solar power generation will be prioritised in their plans. However, chancellor Rishi Sunak has rejected more radical plans such as cutting VAT on fuel bills or delaying a planned national insurance increase to help with household costs. Government officials said that a package worth billions had already been designed, including a £150 council tax rebate for many households in England from April and a £200 energy bill loan in Great Britain in October. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: “We have consistently backed renewable energy sources including both onshore and offshore wind, delivering a 500% increase in the amount of renewable energy capacity connected to the grid since 2010. “We are also accelerating our progress in upgrading the energy efficiency of England’s homes, investing over £6.6bn to decarbonise homes and buildings and bringing in higher minimum performance standards to ensure all homes meet EPC Band C by 2035. We are also insulating millions of consumers from high gas prices through the energy price cap.”",Lifestyle/Money,Cameron’s decision to cut ‘green crap’ now costs each household in England £150 a year,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/19/david-cameron-green-crap-energy-prices
3/20/2022,"Born in Brussels in 1972, Brian Molko is the frontman of alternative rock band Placebo. Co-founded with Stefan Olsdal, the band released their eponymous debut album, which included breakthrough single Nancy Boy, in 1996. Over the following years they became known for their androgynous style, hedonistic lyrics and Molko’s distinctive vocals, and in 1998 they appeared in Todd Haynes’s film Velvet Goldmine. Placebo have released seven albums to date, including Without You I’m Nothing and Meds. Their eighth album, Never Let Me Go, is released on So Recordings on 25 March; they tour the UK later this year. Grandaddy – The Sophtware Slump (20th anniversary) I love this record. When it was first released in 2000, it was the first alternative rock album I’d heard about our developing relationship with computers and technology. It’s fascinating to listen back now, because all the loneliness and disconnect we feel today, it’s all there already. When I listen to it, it’s like sadness is pouring out of the speakers like molasses or treacle. There are songs about trying to find someone you love on internet-controlled CCTV, or losing a friend in a commercial space travel accident. I can’t believe how prescient it was. In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts by Gabor Maté This is a really important book about addiction. Modern addiction treatment hasn’t really evolved much in the past 50 to 100 years – it’s pretty much a one-size-fits-all approach, from my experience – but this book feels like a real gamechanger. Dr Gabor Maté believes that most addiction is the result of unresolved and unprocessed trauma, usually from childhood, which continues to play out in our daily lives. So the question he feels we should be asking is not why the addiction; rather, why the pain? Because that’s basically what most addiction is about: it’s about feelings, and creating coping mechanisms to anaesthetise these feelings. Preacher (Amazon Prime/AMC) If you like your TV escapist and sacrilegious and sexy and comically violent, this is your show. God has left heaven and gone walkabout; meanwhile, the spirit of creation has broken free and is zooming around the Earth trying to find a suitable host, and assassin-type angels are trying to track it down. And that’s just the first episode. Ruth Negga and Joseph Gilgun get total career-defining roles in this series. It’s a modern Life of Brian on psychedelics – I’ve recently rewatched the whole thing and it’s just as thrilling the second time round. Michael Clark: Cosmic Dancer, V&A Dundee This career retrospective pretty much gathered up all the footage from Michael Clark’s history. It wasn’t unlike a Bill Viola exhibition: there were these massive video screens that took you through his development, training and personality to show how he grew into being the choreographer that he became. My highlight was when he started to work with the legend that is Leigh Bowery, and the ballet he created for the Fall called I Am Curious, Orange. His work had been quite calm and contemplative up until then, and then he hit his punk period and it got really fun, really noisy. Children of Men (dir Alfonso Cuarón, 2006) This is set in a dystopian near-future in London. I rewatched it a few times, before and after Brexit kicked in, when I was making the decision to leave the UK. I felt so psychologically brutalised by what was going on that I could really relate to this film again. The police state vision of future England in this movie was slowly becoming a reality: heavily armed police patrols on the streets, refugees and immigrants locked up in camps. Julianne Moore and Clive Owen are excellent, but top prize goes to Michael Caine, who plays this long-haired hippy stoner – his performance is absolutely hilarious. Birdsong.fm I hate memes, but I did see one recently of a hipster saying: “Oh man, I don’t listen to bands any more, they’re all on major labels. I only listen to birdsong.” And it made me think of me, because I don’t listen to much music, I’d often rather listen to birdsong. When I was in central London it became so noisy that I was using this app to drown out the construction noise and the sirens, to try and achieve some kind of peace.

3/20/2022,"The Balkan condiment ajvar is made of roasted, pureed red peppers. It is the sticky centre of Kosovan writer-director Blerta Basholli’s feminist drama, based on a true story, about an enterprising single mother in the strictly patriarchal village of Krushë e Madhe whose decision to start her own ajvar business has everyone talking. Basholli’s agile handheld camera aligns itself with the steely Fahrije (Yllka Gashi), hovering close by as she anticipates her husband’s return from the Kosovan war. “If he ever comes back, he will understand,” she tells her naysayers. Deep down, she knows that the chances of his homecoming are heartbreakingly slim. Disapproving men throw stones at her car, but the local women, who also await their missing men, rally around (the straight-talking Nazmije, played by Kumrije Hoxha, is a particular highlight). Soon, Fahrije’s home becomes a hub or, rather, a hive, buzzing with joy, connection and purpose.

3/20/2022,"Ican’t remember when there was last such an abundance of wonderful exhibitions in London. But if I could frogmarch our current cabinet to only one show, it would be to Postwar Modern: New Art in Britain 1945-1965 at the Barbican. Bordered by barbed wire and suffused with atomic dread, it speaks volumes both about the darkness of conflict, and the particular quality of the light that rises after the bombs cease falling. Most strikingly of all, a sizable amount of the work was made by immigrants to these islands. Of 48 artists, I counted 11 who were born elsewhere. Some are well known: the painter Frank Auerbach, who arrived in Britain thanks to the Kindertransport; the potter Hans Coper, who fled Germany in 1939, only to be interned here as an enemy alien. But there are other, less familiar names, too: Magda Cordell, a Hungarian refugee whose Figure 59 (1958) recalls a body torn by shrapnel; Eva Frankfurther, another escapee from Nazi Germany, whose tender double portrait, West Indian Waitresses (1955), adorns an exhibition poster; Gustav Metzger, the son of Polish Jews who arrived here as a boy, and whose swirling installation, Liquid Crystal Environment (1965), is a highlight of the show. It is, I know, almost impossible to imagine Priti Patel and co wandering a gallery of a weekend. But we live in hope. Someone (not Nadine Dorries) should organise an outing. How good it would be to find the odd oil or sculpture on political social media accounts; to have the Conservative frontbench see that by opening doors, rather than closing them, we always gain vastly more than we lose. Having grown up on David Lodge and Malcolm Bradbury, it’s good to discover that the campus novel is not, after all, dead and dusted. Vladimir (no, not that Vladimir), by the American playwright Julia May Jonas, casts a savagely fresh eye on badly behaved academics, its author having chosen as her narrator a woman who’s not only married to a literature professor who stands accused of #MeToo crimes, but who’s also in the grip of a scandalous drive of her own. Vladimir is her younger colleague – all three characters teach in the same department – and she is sexually obsessed with him, to the point of wanting to tie him up. If this doesn’t sound thrilling enough for you – in which case, I must ask: does a heart really beat inside your ribcage? – let me add that this unnamed middle-aged woman has, in the course of this brilliantly written new book, a series of deeply satisfying run-ins with her ridiculously frail-minded woke students. An extraordinary debut, this critic writes, about to press it on everyone she knows. By the time you read this, I’ll be on my way back home from York, where I will have spent a longish weekend queuing for Bettys and mooching round secondhand bookshops. Time spent in York involves several traditions for me, one of which is always to walk its walls. When I did this as a child, I was forever on the lookout for the chessboard my dad convinced us had been carved into the wall’s flags by some bored Roman soldiers (not quite true, I fear). But these days my mind is usually on bigger (if equally elusive) matters: yes, property. Which house, I ask myself, would be mine in another life? This one, with the red front door and a magnolia tree in the garden? Or that one, with its magnificent gable and superbly easy access to the pub?

3/20/2022,"This was a test Arsenal needed to pass and they did so with conviction, even if the margin of victory was narrow. They had lost here in their previous two visits but this time a similar outcome was never on: a fluent and controlled performance, particularly during a first half in which they afforded Aston Villa almost nothing, ensured their claim to fourth place looks overwhelming and it was a good way to banish any hangover from Wednesday’s home defeat to Liverpool. Bukayo Saka’s crisp strike on the half-hour was enough to restore their momentum and, although they were visibly tired towards the end, a mainly disappointing Villa only showed occasional signs of changing the mood. Arsenal’s spirits in the buildup had been dampened by news that Aaron Ramsdale, such a revelation between the posts this season, will be sidelined for several weeks with a muscle injury. Bernd Leno, who had not made a top-flight appearance since 28 August, deputised but the show was initially stolen by a player who could never quite displace the German during his days as first choice. Emiliano Martínez joined Villa in 2020 to play regularly: in the 10th minute he showed the benefit of practice with an astounding save, plunging low to his left at the closest of quarters and managing to divert the ball after Ezri Konsa had turned Saka’s inquisitive cross towards his own bottom corner. Arsenal were almost entirely dominant, snapping at Villa and showing little sign of fatigue despite Arteta’s strongly expressed consternation that they had only faced Liverpool two and a half days previously. The hosts were allowed no chance to establish a rhythm in the first half and were exposed semi-regularly. Emile Smith Rowe, returning to the starting lineup due to Gabriel Martinelli’s illness, caught the eye as usual with his blend of grace and grit: the England forward could have marked his comeback with a goal in the game’s first significant attack but shot waywardly after smart buildup play between Saka and Martin Ødegaard. Thomas Partey drew a more straightforward save from Martínez while Smith Rowe, running on to a Saka centre, might have scored if Alexandre Lacazette had not been in close proximity. Conditions were windy but on the pitch things were only blowing in one direction. It was little surprise when Saka made Arsenal’s superiority count, even if Steven Gerrard will not have enjoyed the messy defending that contributed. The box was packed when, after a short free-kick, Cédric Soares crossed deep and Granit Xhaka headed on. Villa had a chance to clear but Jacob Ramsey, dabbing out a leg, could only divert the ball out to the ‘D’. From there, Saka returned it with a low half-volley; it was struck firmly and skidded under the right hand of Martínez, who will not enjoy the replays and would surely have done better had he not been unsighted. Arsenal had scored their 2,000th Premier League goal. The home crowd had something to enliven them when Tyrone Mings was booked, ludicrously, after a fair challenge on Saka. But that was as energised as they were allowed to get before half-time; despite such promise on paper, their attacking threat had been reduced to scraps. Villa had not taken a single shot, and if Gerrard was hoping for an instant reversal in fortunes after the interval he would be frustrated. Arsenal kept coming, repeatedly stealing possession and operating with an extra couple of gears. Martínez saved from Smith Rowe after Saka had speared a clever corner out to him, while Ødegaard’s effort was deflected wide. Beyond one sound piece of defending by Gabriel at the far post, Villa were asking few questions in return. When they finally managed an attempt in the 61st minute, John McGinn curled a yard wide of the diving Leno’s post. By that point the hosts had at least started to enjoy more sustained spells of possession even though they were routinely sloppy with it. Xhaka and Partey smothered the supply lines to Philippe Coutinho and Emiliano Buendía throughout; Arsenal still made better use of their attacks and Saka was soon worrying Martínez with a similar effort to tMcGinn’s. But the game was not safe and, as the final quarter approached, Arsenal were in potentially dangerous territory. When Ollie Watkins danced inside from the right, his low effort deflected off Kieran Tierney and clipped the outside the near post. Leon Bailey, Bertrand Traoré and Danny Ings were introduced to help the salvage operation and, much to an increasingly animated Arteta’s chagrin, the outcome remained in theoretical doubt until the end. Ings looped a header over and Martinez ventured up for a last-ditch free-kick but Arsenal rarely looked like being denied.",Sport/Football,Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka makes the difference against Aston Villa ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/aston-villa-arsenal-premier-league-match-report
3/20/2022,"The west must not make the mistake of “normalising” relations with Vladimir Putin again after the invasion of Ukraine, Boris Johnson has said, as he warned that allowing Russia to win would herald intimidation from the Baltic to the Black Sea. The prime minister gave his latest assessment of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at Conservative party conference, describing the Kremlin’s actions “a vicious and a barbarian attack on innocent civilians, the likes of which we haven’t seen since the 1940s”. He warned that if Russia were to succeed in Ukraine then it would be the end of freedom in Ukraine, would mean the “extinction of any hope of freedom” in Moldova and Georgia, and would represent a “green light to autocrats everywhere”. Citing the world’s response after Putin’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, he said: “I know there are some around the world, even in some western governments … who say that we’re better off making accommodations with tyranny. I believe they are profoundly wrong and to try to renormalise relations with Putin after this, as we did in 2014, would be to make exactly the same mistake.” Johnson also appeared to compare the struggle of the Ukrainian people for freedom to the same instincts in the UK population who narrowly voted for Brexit. “I know it’s also the instinct of the people of this country to choose freedom every time … When the British people voted for Brexit in such large numbers … it was because they wanted to be free to do things differently, for this country to be able to do things differently and run itself,” he said. Johnson gave his speech to a hall of activists in Blackpool. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK was also in the audience, alongside the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and defence secretary, Ben Wallace. The prime minister thanked Wallace for making him read “Putin’s crazy essay” about his invasion plan some months ago. But he struck a pessimistic note about the idea that the Russian leader could be deposed, saying he did not believe “democratic freedoms are going to sprout any time soon” in the country. Giving his own analysis of Putin’s motives in invading Ukraine, Johnson said it was because the Russian leader was frightened of having a democratic neighbour with a free press and free elections. “You have to ask yourself why he did it – why did he decide to invade this totally innocent country? “He didn’t really believe that Ukraine was going to join Nato any time soon, he knew perfectly well there was no plan to put missiles on Ukrainian soil. “He didn’t really believe the semi-mystical guff he wrote about the origins of the Russian people ... Nostradamus meets Russian Wikipedia. That wasn’t what it was about. “I think he was frightened of Ukraine for an entirely different reason. He was frightened of Ukraine because in Ukraine they have a free press and in Ukraine they have free elections.”",News/World news,"West must not normalise relations with Putin again, says Boris Johnson ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/west-putin-russia-ukraine-war-boris-johnson
