5/4/2022,"The Democratic Unionist party is under mounting pressure to accept the result of Northern Ireland’s assembly election even if, as polls suggest, Sinn Féin emerges as the biggest party. In a televised party leaders’ debate on Tuesday night, Jeffrey Donaldson faced criticism over his threat to paralyse the formation of a new executive at Stormont after the election on Thursday. Donaldson has said the prospect of Sinn Féin becoming the biggest party is “a problem” and that the DUP would not enter into a power-sharing government unless the Northern Ireland protocol is ditched. Other party leaders and the BBC studio audience rounded on him in the debate, saying such a DUP boycott would stymie a new government and cripple efforts to tackle the cost of living and healthcare crises. An opinion poll on Wednesday ratcheted up the pressure on Donaldson by showing the DUP tied with the Alliance party on 18%, behind Sinn Féin on 26%. Controversy over the post-Brexit protocol, which puts a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, has convulsed the DUP and alienated unionists who accuse it of weakening the region’s position in the UK. Donaldson has sought to claw back support by taking a hard line on the protocol and billing the DUP as a bulwark against Sinn Féin becoming the biggest party and nominating Michelle O’Neill as first minister, which would be a symbolic breakthrough for Irish nationalism. A deputy first minister post has equal power but less prestige. Repeatedly asked in the debate whether the DUP would form an executive, Donaldson said he would turn up at Stormont but would not revive power sharing until the protocol had been dealt with. “Of course I am committed to leading the DUP into executive but we must deal with the protocol,” he said. O’Neill said not having a government post-election would be “absolutely unfathomable” and accused the DUP of holding the region to ransom. “Whilst the rest of us want to put money in the people’s pockets and deal with the cost of living crisis, the DUP are telling people their identity is under threat,” O’Neill said. Naomi Long of Alliance, Doug Beattie of the Ulster Unionists and Colum Eastwood of the Social Democratic and Labour party also assailed Donaldson for prioritising the protocol over bread-and-butter issues. Donaldson, quoting figures from a Kantar price tracker, said the cost of food in Northern Ireland was now 4% higher than in Great Britain, dairy 8% higher and chilled convenience foods 19% higher. “That’s the protocol. That’s why it needs to be sorted,” he said. Manufacturing Northern Ireland said figures from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showed regional inflation was consistently higher in Northern Ireland between January 2020, when Brexit was agreed, up to October 2021, when it fell behind the rest of the UK.

5/4/2022,"Tory candidates in Thursday’s local elections are styling themselves “local Conservatives”, and in some cases urging voters not to punish them for “mistakes made in Westminster”, as they prepare to count the cost of Partygate at the polls. The Conservatives are braced for losses in Thursday’s elections, which will see every seat in Scotland, Wales and London contested, as well as many other English councils. Leaflets delivered in Hartlepool say: “This Thursday, please don’t punish local Conservatives for the mistakes made in Westminster. We are local, and proud of where we live.” In many parts of the country, including Birmingham, St Albans, and the justice secretary, Dominic Raab’s Esher and Walton constituency in Surrey, Tories are listed as “local Conservative”, even on the ballot paper. A leaflet for Keith Rowe, in Birmingham Northfield, carries a picture of the label “Local Conservative” as it will appear on the ballot paper, and the claim: “This is a straight fight between Keith and an unknown Labour candidate.” In Newcastle-under-Lyme, Conservative leaflets stress, “this election is about local issues, not national issues”. Boris Johnson’s picture rarely appears on the scores of local election leaflets from across the country seen by the Guardian. Some MPs, particularly in the south of England, have warned that Partygate is coming up frequently in doorstep conversations – as well as the cost of living crisis. The Liberal Democrats have accused Boris Johnson of failing to campaign in “blue wall” areas such as Surrey, where they believe recent revelations about the prime minister’s lockdown breaches are particularly damaging. Conservative MPs will be watching closely to see whether council seats change hands in their local patch, potentially pointing the way to Labour or the Liberal Democrats challenging them in a future general election. Labour hopes to come second in Scotland, and to make progress in councils covering swing seats in England and Wales they would be need to win to unseat the Conservatives at Westminster. Some Tory MPs say that the aftermath of the poll could prove dangerous for Johnson if the Conservatives have a bad night and he is then blamed for the loss of hundreds of seats. Labour and the Lib Dems are playing down the likelihood of a large number of councils changing hands – but the main parties’ share of the vote will be scrutinised for signs that Johnson has become an electoral liability. The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, said: “It speaks volumes that Boris Johnson’s own Conservative candidates are ashamed to be associated with him and trying to pull the wool over voters’ eyes. “With no answers to the cost of living crisis, Tory candidates are trying to hide from their own government’s record. A vote for Labour on Thursday is a vote to send the Conservatives a message they can’t ignore. Britain deserves better.” The Metropolitan police are continuing their investigation into Partygate. Johnson has received one fixed-penalty notice for breaching lockdown rules by attending a birthday party. The prime minister has told allies he does not expect to receive further fines, but it is widely believed at Westminster that more may be to come. The Met has said it will not update the public further until after the local elections.",News/Politics,Election leaflets distance ‘local Conservatives’ from Boris Johnson ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/04/election-leaflets-distance-local-conservatives-from-boris-johnson
5/4/2022,"Six months ago Bath sent their kids to play a cup match against Gloucester and lost 71-10. On Saturday they went back with their first team, Charlie Ewels, Sam Underhill and Taulupe Faletau in the pack, Ben Spencer and Danny Cipriani, Jonathan Joseph and Joe Cokanasiga in the backs, and lost again, 64-0 this time, with no excuses. It was the latest indignity in a season which has been one long humiliation. They started it by losing 12 games straight, were beaten 71-17 by Saracens, 64-7 by Leinster, 61-19 by Bristol – the sort of scores that make you turn up the radio to check whether you heard them correctly. Bath still have two games left to play, at home to London Irish and away at Worcester, who are one point above them at the bottom of the table. But whatever happens next, it already feels like the season is long beyond saving. It was finished off by the merry cries of “Eeyore!” coming from the Shed as Gloucester ran in their 10 tries. The highlights were like watching traffic bollards try to defend against the sea. The talk about what’s gone wrong at Bath has been going around the grounds all year. They even hired the former Saracens CEO, Ed Griffiths, to try to find out for them mid-season. There are theories, like the question about whether they would have played better if the Premiership wasn’t ring-fenced, and they had been threatened with relegation. The answer must be yes, you guess – imagine how that feels to the fans who just have been told to renew their season tickets by the end of this week if they want to take advantage of the early-bird prices. There’s also a lot of talk about the director of rugby, Stuart Hooper, and whether he was underqualified for the job. There’s talk, too, about their owner, Bruce Craig, who has had a reputation for meddling in selection and with signings, but who has now decided to step down as chairman and let Griffiths take over. Then there’s the training base at Farleigh House, which is lavishly appointed and yet, they say, somehow inadequate for professional training. According to reports Griffiths has already decided they will move away from it next season, when Munster’s Johann van Graan will take over as head coach. Good luck to him. But his appointment begs the question what, exactly, Van Graan is going to do that Steve Meehan, Ian McGeechan, Gary Gold, Mike Ford, Todd Blackadder, Neal Hatley or any of the other well-paid coaches they’ve had at the club in recent years couldn’t. It’s been 27 years since the game turned professional, and in January it will be 25 years since the club won a really significant bit of silverware, when they beat Brive 19-18 in the Heineken Cup Final. That team included Jon Callard, Mike Catt, Phil de Glanville, Nigel Redman, Martin Haag and Victor Ubogu. It was the last hurrah of the “Bath family”. Since then, they’ve won one Challenge Cup. They weren’t the only club who made a mess of the transition to professionalism. But they were the only club who did it in front of a BBC documentary crew. The fly-on-the-wall series they made, The Rugby Club, hasn’t been repeated since, but there were moments in it that are burned indelibly in the memory, like the one in which Jon Hall, their director of rugby, said they were going to be “both the Liverpool and the Manchester United of rugby”. He was teased for it, but the Guardian had made a similar comparison a year earlier: “It’s fair to say that Bath are to rugby what Liverpool were to soccer in the era of Bob Paisley.” Six league titles in eight years, 10 cups in 13, it’s all so well known to old fans that it hardly needs repeating, but so far removed from the present that new ones must think it’s ancient history. This season feels like a wreck that’s followed over a quarter-century of drift through professionalism. All the while, they’ve been waiting for the go-ahead on the new stadium which Hall was talking about back in 1996 (“It will be a 15,000 seat multi-sport arena,” he said, “we want it to be feasible venue for the Commonwealth Games”). In March the club got permission from the council to keep their temporary stand up for another three years as a holdover. It’s as if they lost something vital about themselves when the game made the big change. You could see them scrabbling around to understand it themselves in the worst parts of the BBC documentary, when their new head of marketing suggested they rename themselves the Bath Wreckers. Leicester, Bristol, Harlequins and Saracens have been to the bottom and back again since then, but their turnarounds were grounded in a strong sense of identity, in having a clear idea who they are and how they want to play – in doing it “their way”. Bath used to take all that for granted. But they seem to have spent the professional era looking for someone to define it for them, which is why they’ve had as many different answers as they have high-profile coaches. They still have the fans and are one of the best-attended clubs in the league, despite it all. They still have the players coming through their academy. And there are plenty of people there who care. But something’s gone seriously wrong with the culture higher up the club. Some say that relegation might actually be better for them, that it would be the shock the club needs. The trouble with that plan is you’d need to believe they would definitely be able to find their way back again. Right now, you wouldn’t fancy them to beat Ealing.",Sport/Sport,Bath’s rugby history is so far removed from the present that it feels ancient | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/04/bath-glorious-rugby-union-past-feels-ancient
5/4/2022,"The horror and misery of the Gaza conflict, and the 11-day bombing campaign by Israel in 2021, is reflected upon in this grim documentary codirected by the Palestinian film-maker Mohammed Sawwaf and Britain’s Michael Winterbottom. The assault was triggered by Israeli security forces services taking up positions on Temple Mount and in the Palestinian Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem; Hamas fired rockets when they did not withdraw, and Israel responded with overwhelming military force. During the bombardment more than 250 Palestinians were killed, including more than 60 Palestinian children (with an estimated 13 people on the Israeli side, said its officials, including two children). This film sets out to memorialise the Palestinian children who were killed There are heart-wrenching interviews with the families, with translations narrated by Kate Winslet, and surviving family members are asked to pose for a sombre “portrait” tableaux, from which some adults break away, their faces in their hands, unable to control their tears. There are also unbearably grim mortuary shots of the children’s dead bodies, which have earned this film its 18 certificate. The documentary sticks to its brief: there is no geopolitical contextualising, and it does not, for example, talk about Hamas anger at what it sees as the west’s hypocrisy in supporting Ukrainians but not Palestinians – but neither does the film consider Hamas’s notable reluctance to criticise Putin’s invasion. Perhaps all this came too late to be included. What it does is go from family to family, telling very similar stories. The effect is repetitive, relentless – much like the events themselves. It is a very bleak picture, something to be compared, perhaps, with Garry Keane and Andrew McConnell’s film Gaza about life under siege.

5/4/2022,"Scientists have identified specific groups of gut microbes that could increase or decrease someone’s risk of suffering the most common type of stroke. The research, presented at the European Stroke Organisation Conference (ESOC) in Lyon, France, adds to growing evidence that alterations in the gut microbiome could play a role in cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have suggested that certain microbes may influence the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries, and that the gut microbiomes of stroke patients differ from those of healthy controls. To investigate whether they may also influence people’s recovery from stroke, Dr Miquel Lledós from the Sant Pau Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain, and colleagues took stool samples from 89 people who had very recently suffered an ischaemic stroke (where a blood clot blocks the flow of oxygen to the brain), as well as from healthy individuals, and performed DNA sequencing to identify the different microorganisms present in their guts, and whether certain groups of bacteria correlated with their functional recovery. “We identified new [bacterial] taxa associated with higher risk of stroke severity in the acute phase at six hours and at 24 hours,” Lledós said. “We also identified one class, one genus, and one species related to poor functional outcomes at three months after ischaemic stroke. “The discovery opens the exciting prospect that, in the future, we may be able to prevent strokes or improve neurological recovery by examining the gut microbiota. Nowadays, there are no specific neuroprotective treatments to prevent neurological worsening after stroke. The use of new therapies such as changes in the microbiome through nutritional changes or faecal transplantation could be useful to improve post-stroke evolution.” Meanwhile, separate research presented by Cyprien Rivier from Yale University in Connecticut, US, used a statistical technique called Mendelian randomisation to investigate whether the link between stroke risk and alterations in the gut microbiome is truly causal. They combined data from 2,300 participants involved in the Flemish Gut Flora Project, plus a further 34,000 people enrolled in a large study examining the role of genetics in stroke risk, looking at whether genes known to increase people’s likelihood of harbouring specific microbial species influenced their risk of ischaemic stroke. Doing so identified 26 bacterial species that were significantly associated with stroke. “Most of the bacteria we found are associated with lower risk, but five of them are associated with an increase in the risk of either ischaemic stroke or one of the subtypes of this type of stroke,” said Rivier. The next step will be to explore the mechanisms by which the presence or absence of certain species contributes to stroke risk. River said: “Bacteria can release toxins into the blood, they can also produce certain proteins that interfere with physiological processes. There is also what we call the microbiota-gut-brain axis – a bidirectional pathway between the brain and the microbiome, whereby the brain is influencing the gut through the nerves, and the microbiome is in turn influencing the organs, including the brain, mainly through altering the blood pressure.”",News/Society,"Certain gut microbes may affect stroke risk and severity, scientists find",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/04/certain-gut-microbes-may-affect-stroke-risk-and-severity-scientists-find
5/4/2022,"The prospect of the US supreme court overturning Roe v Wade has dominated front pages across the world, with the global media reporting in detail on one of the most polarising issues in American politics. The Washington Post leads on concerns that overthrowing the legislation represents a threat to abortion rights for women everywhere. The newspaper quotes leaders from across the world in support of the 1973 ruling, including comments from the French senator Julien Bargeton that it would be “a terrible regression for American women” and that “progressives around the world must mobilise”. Le Monde reports that the 98-page draft decision is “very striking in its unreserved and nuanced condemnation, never before formulated in these terms, of the entire legal architecture that has contributed to making abortion a constitutional right”. Many papers carry reports on a growing divide in US society. Bild announces: “The USA is heading for a new peak in the culture wars!” The judgment, it says, “could divide America”. USA Today carries a similar warning, leading on Biden’s assessment that if Roe v Wade is overturned, then a “whole range of rights could now be at risk”. El País leads on Biden’s comments that “a woman’s right to choose is fundamental … and the basic fairness and stability of our legal system demand that it not be overturned”. El Mundo reports on the “rage of pro-abortion protesters [as it] explodes in front of the US supreme court”. The New York Times, however, points out that despite the vow by Biden and other Democrats to respond to Roe’s proposed demise, they are in reality powerless to stop the legislation being overturned, as the battle for abortion rights shifts from Washington to the individual states. Die Welt also focuses on the Democrats, this time in an opinion piece claiming they are also to blame for this “disaster”. “Their mistakes are now taking revenge,” the piece states. “The Democrats, with their political focus on identitarian issues and their sometimes openly displayed dislike of the rural population, are hardly present in many states.” Carrying photos of angry demonstrations outside the supreme court, as protesters brandished coat hangers that invoke images of back-alley abortions, the Wall Street Journal looks at the corporate reaction. Many, it says, have stayed silent, but a few have come out strongly in support of the protesters, including Lyft – the ride-hailing company that has a history of enacting policies in response to anti-abortion legalisation – Bill Gates and Sheryl Sandberg. Corriere della Sera also approaches the story from a business angle, focusing on Amazon announcing that it will pay travel expenses for employees who need medical help, including abortions.

5/4/2022,"Strange as it may seem that a team could glean added motivation before a European semi-final, Rangers’ desire to see off RB Leipzig has been intensified by the sudden death of their kit man, Jimmy Bell. Bell had worked at Ibrox for more than 30 years and news of his death reached a stunned Rangers squad on Monday. He had been in the dugout as Rangers drew at Celtic Park on Sunday. Giovanni van Bronckhorst, speaking as his team prepare for the visit of Leipzig – who hold a 1-0 advantage in this Europa League tie – said reaching the final would be the perfect way to honour Bell. “It was a really big game already but we are all very determined to go out and give everything we can to make everyone proud and especially make Jimmy proud,” the manager said. “We were all very shocked by the news that Jimmy passed away. It [Monday] was a hard day for all of us and I think everyone was really down, as you can imagine. We didn’t do a lot. We were all at the training ground but the atmosphere was very down and still in shock. “Of course we are still mourning and still down but the character of my players is the best I have seen in any team I have coached. I am sure that the character, the belief, the determination will be there. We will do everything to reach the final. It will be emotional but we will be ready when the whistle goes.” Van Bronckhorst’s sentiment was replicated by the captain, James Tavernier. “It is obviously devastating for the club and everyone who knew Jimmy, especially his family,” Tavernier said. “But I know Jimmy wouldn’t want the fuss. He would want us to pull our socks up, roll our sleeves up and get stuck in tomorrow, even in training today. That was him, the standards that he set. Come tomorrow everyone will be ready to go from the first whistle. We are going to do it for the club, do it for the fans and obviously do it for Jimmy.” Van Bronckhorst will make a late decision over the fitness of Kemar Roofe and Aaron Ramsey, who missed the defeat in Germany and the weekend derby through injury. The Dutchman refused to pay heed to Leipzig’s second Bundesliga loss in succession, which arrived at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Monday. “We have to prepare for a really tough game against a really good opponent,” he said. “They haven’t had the results they wanted and they are now in fifth place.

5/4/2022,"The Dorset teenager Gaia Pope, who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after she was allegedly drugged and raped, was sexually harassed while being treated on a mixed psychiatric ward, an inquest jury has heard. Pope informed staff that a male patient on the ward at St Ann’s hospital in Poole made explicit sexual comments and suggestions and tried to hug her but jurors were told that no safeguarding referral was made. Dr Dinesh Kannan, a consultant psychiatrist who assessed Pope on the Seaview Ward, described what happened to the teenager there as a “peril of the mixed ward” but admitted a referral should have been made. Pope was allegedly raped in 2014 when she was 16 after her drink was spiked. She reported the alleged attack and, although police investigated, the alleged rapist was not charged. In 2016, she was diagnosed with PTSD. In November 2017, Pope, 19, who had epilepsy, vanished from her hometown of Swanage and her body was found on a clifftop 11 days later. She is believed to have died of hypothermia. On Wednesday, the jury heard how nine months before her death, in February 2017, Pope experienced a severe epileptic seizure and what appeared to be a psychotic episode. The court heard she had been contacted by her alleged attacker and had a “revelation” that he was “at large”. She was assessed under the Mental Health Act at the Seaview Ward. Pope told a nurse she had been the target of inappropriate behaviour and sexual harassment from a male patient, jurors heard. The court was told the patient allegedly made comments about his and her private parts, asked her to go to the gym so he could look at her breasts and tried to hug her. Kannan, who oversaw Pope’s care on the ward, said: “I’m deeply sorry for what Gaia had to endure” and added: “We should have considered raising a safeguarding alert.” Pope made light of what happened to her, saying she knew self-defence and had “been through a lot worse”, and joking that she felt sorry for the man’s girlfriend. The teenager spent eight days in the hospital, run by Dorset HealthCare University NHS foundation trust, and was discharged with 14 days’ worth of the anti-anxiety medication diazepam. Kannan told the jury he accepted there was a “close link” between Pope’s epilepsy and her mental health issues. He accepted it would have been “good practice” for him or his colleagues to speak to neurologists who were working with Pope for her epilepsy but this did not happen. “That was a missed opportunity,” Kannan said. “We should have liaised. The communication could have been much better.” Another psychiatrist, Ramesh Hariyapureddy, told the jury he also accepted this was a “missed opportunity”. He also said it would have been “very helpful” to speak to Pope’s cousin, Marienna Pope-Weidemann, who repeatedly tried to talk to psychiatrists about the teenager’s case. But this, too, did not happen. The inquest in Bournemouth continues. + In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

5/4/2022,"Fresh evidence has been found against the prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, a German prosecutor has revealed. Hans Christian Wolters said in an interview on Portuguese television that investigators believed they had found “some facts, some new evidence, not forensic evidence.” Officials in Faro, Portugal, said last week that Christian Brückner, 44, a convicted rapist, was an arguido, or formal suspect – the first time Portuguese authorities have officially identified a suspect in the case since Madeleine’s parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were declared such in 2007. They were formally cleared of suspicion in 2008. Brückner has previously denied any involvement in three-year-old Madeleine’s disappearance. Wolters, who has been investigating Brückner since 2020 over the Madeleine case and other alleged offences, was asked in the TV interview whether it was true that German investigators had found something belonging to Madeleine in a caravan used by Brückner. “You can’t deny it, can you?” the CMTV interviewer asked. Wolters replied: “I don’t want to deny it.” He added: “We are sure that he is the murderer of Madeleine McCann. We are sure that he killed Madeleine McCann. The investigation is still going on and I think we found some new facts, some new evidence – not forensic evidence, but evidence.” Speaking on the eve of the 15th anniversary of their daughter’s disappearance on 3 May 2007, Kate and Gerry McCann said a “horrific crime” had been committed and they were still seeking answers. They said in a statement: “This year we mark 15 years since we last saw Madeleine. It feels no harder than any other but no easier either. It’s a very long time. Many people talk about the need for closure. It’s always felt a strange term. “Regardless of outcome, Madeleine will always be our daughter and a truly horrific crime has been committed. These things will remain.” Last week, the couple said they welcomed the news that the Portuguese authorities had declared an arguido. They said: “Even though the possibility may be slim, we have not given up hope that Madeleine is still alive and we will be reunited with her.” German police said in June 2020 that Madeleine was assumed dead and that Brückner was probably responsible for her disappearance. However, British officers continue to treat it as a missing persons case. Germany, unlike Portugal, does not have a statute of limitations for murder. Wolters, the state prosecutor in Braunschweig, is investigating Brückner for five separate alleged offences. They include three cases of rape and two cases of child molestation, the most recent in 2017 when Brückner is alleged to have exposed himself and masturbated in front of a group of children.",News/UK news,"Madeleine McCann: ‘new evidence’ linked to suspect found, prosecutor says",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/04/some-new-evidence-found-against-madeleine-mccann-suspect-christian-bruckner
5/4/2022,"A Russian businessman and close ally of Vladimir Putin accused by the US, EU and others of financing the private military company Wagner Group has said that “a dying-out western civilisation” will be defeated by Russia. The Guardian had approached Yevgeny Prigozhin seeking his reaction to evidence implicating Wagner fighters in massacres in Mali. In response he said he had “repeatedly said that the Wagner Group does not exist” and that he had “nothing to do with it”. “You are a dying-out western civilisation that considers Russians, Malians, Central Africans, Cubans, Nicaraguans and many other peoples and countries to be third world scum,” the businessman added. “Remember, this is not true …. You are a pathetic endangered bunch of perverts, and there are many of us, billions of us. And victory will be ours!” Prigozhin said he was “closely following the events taking place in Mali” where “the collective west, namely the USA, Britain, France and other countries trying to pursue a policy of enslaving Africa, have been planting and organising terrorist groups in Mali for years”. This was being done, he said, “in order to keep the population of this country in fear, to plunder its natural wealth and to write off the money allocated for so-called peacekeeping operations”. Contradicting Prigozhin, on Sunday the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, acknowledged that Wagner was operating in Mali and Libya. Lavrov told an Italian television network that Wagner was present in the two African countries “on a commercial basis” but reiterated Moscow’s official position that Wagner “has nothing to do with the Russian state”. Western officials allege the Kremlin is using Wagner to advance Russian economic and political interests across Africa and elsewhere. The group – also linked to human rights abuses in Syria and Ukraine – is known to have deployed fighters and advisers in more than a dozen countries after being first identified in 2014, when backing pro-Russian separatists in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Allegations that the Wagner Group and the Malian army were involved in massacres and other human rights abuses were false, Pirozghin said. “Any terrorist killed by the Malian army, the collective west tried to pass off as a civilian … As to the [alleged] atrocities, neither I, nor the men I know, nor the Malian army have committed them.” The businessman also accused the French army of “mercilessly” killing civilians and burying their remains “not far from military bases”. France deployed troops to Mali in 2012 when Islamist and other insurgents formed a powerful alliance. In February Emmanuel Macron announced the troops were leaving after a breakdown in relations with the country’s ruling junta. Last month, the French military said Wagner mercenaries buried bodies near a Malian military base in order to falsely accuse France’s departing forces of leaving behind mass graves. The French army said it used a drone to film what appeared to be white soldiers covering bodies with sand near the Gossi base in northern Mali. Prigozhin, who earned the nickname “Putin’s cook” after winning catering contracts for state banquets, was indicted by the United States in 2018 for allegedly financing an online operation to influence the 2016 United States elections. He has also been accused of leading systematic efforts to influence opinion through false social media accounts in Africa, where Facebook has repeatedly removed accounts believed to have been set up by Wagner operatives. Prigozhin said the Guardian had spread “fakes, outright lies and … falsification” and tried to “spit in the face of me, the Russian patriots, and the Malian people”. “There is a proverb: ‘Don’t try to piss against the wind, you will get drowned in the splash.’ These atrocities are committed in your inflamed brain, infected with the disease called ‘Nazism’.”",News/World news,Wagner-linked Putin ally: ‘Dying west thinks Russians are third world scum’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/putin-ally-yevgeny-prigozhin-wagner-group-dying-west-russians-third-world-scum
5/4/2022,"Western officials told the Guardian earlier this year that the Wagner mercenary group was the “thin end of the wedge” and a “Trojan horse” for a Russian effort to extend its influence covertly in resource-rich and unstable parts of Africa. In Mali, the group is filling a vacuum left by departing French troops who led international efforts to counter a decade-long insurgency. That effort, which included one of the largest UN peacekeeping missions in the world, failed, and the violence has spilled across the volatile Sahel region, displacing tens of millions and destabilising fragile countries such as Niger and Burkina Faso. “Wagner is one of the means Russia is using to spread influence and advance economic and other interests in Africa,” said Jared Thompson, a research associate with the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. “Wagner arrived in Mali at the same time as Malian officials went to Russia and as Moscow was selling arms to Bamako [the capital of Mali]. This certainly suggests Wagner’s deployment is part of a broader effort.” Last weekend, Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, told Italian TV that Wagner was present in Mali and Libya “on a commercial basis” and reiterated Moscow’s official position that Wagner “has nothing to do with the Russian state”. Though the group helped government forces fight off a rebel offensive in Central African Republic, its intervention in Mozambique against Islamic militants was a bloody and expensive debacle. And analysts say Wagner’s tactics in Mali risk a backlash among local communities, which would make Islamist extremist violence in Mali much worse. “The Russians are like a bull in the china shop and appear not to be aware of or care about the crucial ethnic dynamics,” said Corinne Dufka, a Sahel-based researcher with Human Rights Watch. “Their behaviour – with the clear complicity of the Malians – is deepening ethnic tensions and creating lots of new jihadists by way of these exactions.” The Wagner intervention has been part of a broader offensive launched by Malian forces across central Mali after gains made by insurgents in areas closer to Bamako. Analysts are sceptical that will succeed. “It’s fundamentally a governance problem so a military response alone is unlikely to be successful, and particularly not if it risks exacerbating existing problems relating to impunity in Mali,’ said Catherine Evans, a director at Independent Diplomat, a not-for-profit diplomatic advisory group, and a former British ambassador to Mali.",News/World news,"Presence of Russian mercenaries in Mali risks bloody backlash, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/russian-mercenaries-wagner-group-mali-analysis
5/4/2022,"Russian mercenaries in Africa have been linked to massacres in which several hundred civilians have died, raising new fears about the impact of Moscow’s intensifying interventions on the stability and security of countries across the continent. Western officials have so far largely steered clear of naming the perpetrators of killings but witnesses, local community leaders, diplomats and local analysts blamed many of the deaths on fighters deployed by the Wagner Group, a network of private companies run by a close ally of Vladimir Putin. The incidents have occurred in Mali, the strategic west African country where Wagner arrived last year after striking a deal with its new military rulers. Internal Malian army documents seen by the Guardian reveal the presence of Wagner members on “mixed missions” with Malian soldiers and gendarmes during operations in which many civilians have been killed. According to data compiled by the NGO Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), as many as 456 civilians died in nine incidents involving Malian forces and Wagner between January and mid-April this year. By far the most serious incident occurred in March when the Wagner Group is alleged to have been involved in a massacre in Moura, a village controlled by Islamist extremists, where between 350 and 380 men were killed over a four-day period. Last week new allegations surfaced about two shootings in villages around the town of Hombori in the central Mopti region, following the death of one or possibly two Wagner mercenaries accompanying Malian troops on operations against Islamist militants. Aid workers, experts and human rights campaigners said one attack came after a military patrol was ambushed on the outskirts of a village at about 9.30am on 19 April. According to an internal Malian military memo, a “Russian instructor” was injured by an improvised mine and died after being airlifted to the town of Sevare. A medical official in Sevare described the man as a Russian in his 30s. Following the ambush, Malian soldiers fired on a crowded marketplace. Mali’s military rulers, who took power in a coup in May last year, have said the Russians in the country are instructors and not deployed in combat roles. The army – sometimes know by the abbreviation FAMA – has denied a Russian was killed on 19 April and said the casualty was one of their own soldiers. It has also denied killing any civilians and said 18 terrorists had been “neutralised” during “vigorous” security operations. Another internal memo described a clash on 23 April between militants and “a joint patrol of FAMA and Russian instructors” between the villages of Mondoro and Boni. “Provisional losses” amounted to “two dead – one FAMA and one Russian – and 10 wounded – six FAMA and four Russians”, said the memo, sent some hours after the incident. Details of “enemy losses” were “unavailable for the moment”. Twelve other people – who may have been extremists – are also thought to have died. Wagner has been active in a dozen countries across Africa, and it has been repeatedly accused of human rights abuses on the continent. On Tuesday a Human Rights Watch report alleged that forces in the Central African Republic identified as Russian appear to have killed and tortured civilians since 2019, echoing similar findings from a group of UN experts last year. The group has also taken part in the invasion of Ukraine and been linked to atrocities there. British officials have expressed concerns at “a significant deterioration in the human rights situation” in Mali in recent months, which they noted coincided with the arrival of between 600 and 1,000 Wagner fighters. “Just as the presence of Russian mercenaries drove an increase in human rights violations and abuses in the Central African Republic in 2021, the same is now being seen in Mali,” one UK diplomat said. The country’s new rulers hired Wagner for an estimated rate of $10m a month to be paid both in cash and through rights to extract minerals, experts believe. The group set up a headquarters near the capital’s international airport in December, satellite photographs shared by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and flight records reveal, before moving out to forward operating bases across a swath of territory in the centre of Mali in January and February. Community leaders, diplomats and officials have told the Guardian that Wagner fighters have been seen on joint patrols with Malian armed forces along the restive border with Burkina Faso and Niger, on the western frontier with Mauritania, and also in towns in northern Mali, including Timbuktu. Pilots supplied by Wagner now fly Malian army helicopters and the group has also provided fighters who have led Malian forces on bigger operations, notably a major push against Islamist insurgents that began in late February. In early March, more than 30 bodies were found burnt in the town of Niono in central Mali following operations by Malian forces supported by Wagner. Local witnesses accused both Malian and Russian fighters of killing civilians. Many victims had been tied and blindfolded, then shot, according to Human Rights Watch. Malian authorities denied the allegations. Moura, where the alleged massacre of hundreds took place in March, is a village in an inaccessible swampy area of the floodplain of the Niger River which has been controlled for many years by militants from the al-Qaida-linked Group of Support for Islam and Muslims (GSIM). The extremists have imposed their rigorous and intolerant version of Sharia law on inhabitants, raised taxes and made local men follow their dress codes. Amadou Barry, who lives in the neighbouring village, told the Guardian he was attending the weekly market in Moura on 27 March when helicopters suddenly appeared and troops disembarked. A small group of Islamist militants in the village shot at the soldiers and then fled on motorbikes. “All of us started running in every direction, some into the houses. The Malian army then opened fire on people running, killing so many people,” Barry said. Malian soldiers then marched hundreds of men from the village to a dry river bed nearby for interrogation. The men were held there with little food or water for four days, while soldiers periodically led groups of captives away to be killed, Barry and other witnesses said. Some villagers were released after their fingers and shoulders were inspected for signs that they had fired guns, but all men from the Peuhl ethnic minority were detained, Barry said. The GSIM and other extremist Islamist factions have sought to recruit among the pastoralist Peuhl by exploiting grievances with the government and other ethnic groups. According to survivors, those killed in Moura were all from the Peuhl community. Héni Nsaibia, senior researcher at ACLED, said between 60 and 100 of those killed may have been unarmed Islamist militants, but the rest were civilians. Government forces found large quantities of weapons in Moura. Several witnesses said the operation was led by white men speaking “a strange language” which some identified as Russian, though most of the soldiers who killed civilians were “Malian people”. Ousmane Diallo, a researcher for Amnesty International in Mali, said testimony collected from survivors and witnesses confirmed that white soldiers landed in Moura on 27 March in helicopters and stayed for days. “We know that Wagner are deployed in central Mali, they’ve been assisting operations in lifting and bringing more soldiers to their positions in the region. I think it’s pretty clear that it was Wagner that was conducting this operation,” Diallo said. Nsaibia said his own exhaustive research among survivors led to a similar conclusion, while a west African diplomat in Mali said “inquiries into the events in Moura had confirmed that Wagner forces were working with Malian forces in central Mali”. Human Rights Watch, the campaign group, called the incident “the worst single atrocity reported in Mali’s decade-long armed conflict”. The Malian army said it killed 203 militants during a military operation in Moura and denied reports of executions. Russia vetoed a bid at the United Nations to commission an independent investigation into the massacre, and Mali has blocked efforts by the UN to send a team to Moura. Moscow’s deputy ambassador to the UN said Mali’s authorities did “not have a hidden agenda” and that claims of the involvement of Russian mercenaries in the massacre were part of “a sordid geopolitical game”. The US and others have alleged that Wagner is funded by the powerful businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is closely linked to Putin. Contacted by the Guardian this week Prigozhin denied any knowledge of the group and denied the reports of massacres. “Any terrorist killed by the Malian army, the collective west tried to pass off as a civilian … As to the [alleged] atrocities, neither I, nor the men I know, nor the Malian army have committed them,” he said. Prigozhin accused the Guardian of “fakes, outright lies and … falsification” and of trying to “spit in the face of me, the Russian patriots, and the Malian people”. Last week, Islamist extremists from the GSIM claimed to have captured a fighter from Wagner in the Segou region in central Mali. The GSIM statement said: “These murderous forces participated with the Malian army in an airdrop operation on a market in the village of Moura, where they confronted several mujahideen before … killing hundreds of innocent civilians.” Analysts believe the Wagner operative was probably captured in February. Deaths of “three or four” Wagner operatives had been “more or less” confirmed but total casualties were likely to be higher, said Nsaibia. Islamist militant groups were also responsible for killing large numbers of civilians in indiscriminate attacks and many other human rights abuses, officials and campaigners said. Several attacks by Islamic State in the Greater Sahara around Menaka and in the south near Gao last month led to the deaths of at least 40 civilians and displacement of thousands. The alleged capture of one of its fighters showed how deeply Wagner had become involved in the conflict in Mali, said Jared Thompson, a research associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They are now a very direct conflict actor that has skin in the game.” A correspondent in Bamako contributed to this report",News/World news,Russian mercenaries linked to civilian massacres in Mali,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/russian-mercenaries-wagner-group-linked-to-civilian-massacres-in-mali
5/4/2022,"A sought-after hormone replacement therapy is being reassessed for use in Scotland after the TV presenter and menopause campaigner Davina McCall revealed a postcode lottery in its prescription across the UK. Amid an ongoing supply crisis of HRT products, McCall spoke to specialists about the benefits of utrogestan, a “body identical” micronised progesterone, which is derived from plants, in her Channel 4 documentary Sex, Mind and Menopause, broadcast on Monday. The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), an independent group that decides which medicines should be accepted for use by NHS Scotland, rejected utrogestan for general use in 2009. But on Tuesday, the SMC revealed that – while it was not previously satisfied that the drug offered value for money – another company now owned the rights to the medicine since that advice was issued and it had been encouraged to resubmit its application. A spokeswoman said: “It has been urged to make a resubmission so that we can assess the evidence and provide updated advice to NHS Scotland.” The Scottish government said it was committed to ensuring that menopausal women received equitable access to medicines, adding that although utrogestan was not routinely available, clinicians could still prescribe it on a case-by-case basis. A spokesperson added: “We have encouraged the manufacturer of utrogestan to resubmit its medicine to the Scottish Medicines Consortium, so that it can be considered for routine access within NHS Scotland, and we understand that the manufacturer is in the process of confirming timescales for a resubmission.” Caroline Phipps-Urch, who lives in Edinburgh and presents the Menopause Sisters show on UK Health Radio with her sibling, the GP Dr Claire Phipps, started a petition last year to persuade her local health board, NHS Lothian, to prescribe the drug. “A lot of women just don’t know this is a possibility,” she told the Guardian, adding that many specialists consider utrogestan safer than synthetic progesterones, such as the Mirena coil, and only marginally more expensive. She said that celebrities like McCall speaking out about their experiences of the menopause was adding to a momentum among all women to push for better treatment. “A lot of celebrities around this age are feeling confident to speak out about it, and more generally there’s a feeling amongst women that we’ve had enough.” “Women’s health in general has long been neglected and this is about having shared decision-making with their GP and about choice. We know that HRT protects women from heart disease, stroke and osteoporosis, so we’re looking at saving money in treatment long-term.” Last week, Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, told the Guardian that “so many” women were experiencing distress and some were risking serious side-effects by using medication prescribed to others, because of acute shortages of some HRT products, which are used by about 1 million women in the UK to treat symptoms of the menopause.",News/Society,Scottish medicines body to reassess menopause drug amid HRT shortage,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/04/scottish-medicines-reassess-utrogestan-hrt-shortage-menopause
5/4/2022,"The comedian Dave Chappelle was attacked during a performance in Los Angeles, according to witnesses and videos of the incident posted online. Footage showed someone running on stage and tackling Chappelle during his performance at the Netflix Is a Joke festival at Hollywood Bowl on Tuesday night. The incident took place as the comedian was closing the show and thanking earlier performers including Chris Rock, Leslie Jones and Jon Stewart. Chappelle, 48, was apparently unharmed and returned to the stage to finish his set, joking to the audience that the attacker “was a trans man” – a reference to the uproar his comments about gender had caused in the trans community. According to Brianna Sacks, a journalist for BuzzFeed News who tweeted about the incident, several security guards punched and kicked the attacker. Video later showed an unidentified man with a badly injured arm being put in an ambulance. Sacks said that the Hollywood actor Jamie Foxx went on stage after the incident looking “absolutely shocked”, and that the musicians Mos Def and Talib Kweli performed as vehicles from the Los Angeles police department (LAPD) arrived behind the stage. NBC News Los Angeles reported that the LAPD confirmed they had taken a man into custody and that he was armed with a replica gun “that can eject a knife blade” when discharged correctly. It is unclear if the man tried to use the weapon. Just came out of the Hollywood Bowl where a man charged and tackled Dave Chapelle on stage and got his ass kicked by at least 10 people.LAPD and LAFD are now loading him into an ambulance pic.twitter.com/7SXPe9e8az The attack came after an incident in which Rock was slapped by Will Smith on stage at the Oscars after he made a joke about the actor’s wife. The slap prompted some comedians to question whether it remained safe to perform publicly. Others have written about poor audience behaviours since lockdown. Sharon Carpenter, an LA-based journalist who was also in the audience on Tuesday, told the PA news agency: “It looked like someone dashed from the side of the stage, lunged at Dave, and all I saw was Dave basically flying in the air. “He fell backwards on to his back, with his arms and legs up in the air. He was obviously in shock. We were all in shock. And I thought for a moment: ‘OK, is this a prank?’ because they had made some Will Smith jokes.” Carpenter said Chappelle tried to keep the show going and made jokes about the situation, “but he was also pissed off about it … What was crazy too is that earlier in the night he made a joke about: ‘Oh, I heard people are getting slapped around here.’” According to the ABC journalist Stephanie Wash, Rock came on stage with Chappelle. “Chris Rock, who performed earlier, came on stage w/ him & joked: ‘Was that Will Smith?’” she posted on Twitter. Dave Chapelle was rushed & attacked on stage by a man at the Hollywood Bowl. Chapelle tussled w/ the man, who ran behind the screen on stage & was surrounded by security. Chris Rock, who performed earlier, came on stage w/ him & joked: “Was that Will Smith?” #netflixisajokefest The British comedian Jimmy Carr was also among those at the show and expressed his relief that nobody was seriously injured. Carr, who was at the centre of his own controversy earlier this year for a routine about the Holocaust, posted a selfie taken with Chappelle, adding that he was “just happy everyone’s OK”. The Hollywood Bowl show with the legendary Dave Chappelle was crazy. Just happy everyone’s ok. pic.twitter.com/Jji0mv2ub6 Chappelle has previously faced a backlash over comments about transgender people in his Netflix comedy special, The Closer. The comedian said “gender is a fact” and gave his backing to JK Rowling, who has also attracted criticism for her remarks about the concept of biological sex. Netflix employees reacted with anger to his comments and organised a walkout over the streaming giant’s decision to air the special. A spokesperson for Hollywood Bowl said an investigation had been launched into the incident. She added that it was “an active investigation and we are unable to comment further at this time”.",Arts/Stage,Dave Chappelle attacked by man with replica gun at LA comedy festival,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/04/dave-chappelle-attacked-by-man-with-replica-gun-at-la-comedy-festival
