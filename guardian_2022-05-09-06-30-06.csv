5/9/2022,"Max Verstappen won the inaugural Miami Grand Prix for Red Bull, putting in a flawless run to edge the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc into second place. In control at the Miami International Autodrome, the reigning champion delivered an ice-cool performance on an afternoon baking in the Florida sunshine amid huge expectations for this first race here, a key part of Formula One’s efforts to break America. Carlos Sainz was in third for Ferrari, ahead of Sergio Pérez, with Mercedes enjoying an improved afternoon after recent travails with George Russell and Lewis Hamilton taking fifth and sixth. The win has tightened up the fight for the championship after five rounds, with Leclerc’s lead over Verstappen cut from 27 to 19 points. Starting from pole, Leclerc held his lead into turn one as Verstappen launched himself up the outside of Sainz in an excellent move to claim second place. It was a vital pass for Verstappen to split the two Ferraris. Leclerc and Verstappen had opened up a gap out front but with the former’s tyres taking a pounding and his having made an error in turn 17, the Dutchman with dominant race pace made a decisive move up the inside of turn one on lap nine. Just as when he went ahead at the last round in Imola it was a lead he never looked like surrendering. He enjoyed over a two-second advantage by lap 12 and held his lead through the only pit stops. Ferrari were simply not in the fight and Verstappen was proving he is rarely prone to error when he has a race by the scruff of the neck. He held his place after a late safety car and, while Leclerc stuck with him and pressured to the flag, he duly closed it out with finality to take his third win of the season. This was perhaps not quite the spectacle Miami – David Beckham was among the celebrity attendees – had been hoping for but on this form Ferrari and Leclerc need to find more to take the fight to Verstappen. F1 will nonetheless consider its first outing in Miami a success; certainly the sold-out event with 82,500 fans was embraced by them with huge enthusiasm. The grandstands roaring to every move being made on track. Verstappen has ensured he was central to that success story and F1’s racing history in the sunshine state. This was the first time a GP had been held in Florida since 1959, when Sebring played host to the final race of the season and Jack Brabham clinched the title by pushing his fuel-less car over the line to take fourth place.",Sport/Sport,Max Verstappen holds off challenge of Charles Leclerc to win Miami Grand Prix,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/08/max-verstappen-holds-off-challenge-of-charles-leclerc-to-win-miami-grand-prix
5/9/2022,"With one exception, this year’s TV Baftas got things spectacularly right. It’s always hard to single out specific shows and personalities who are worthy of praise in an age when so much good television is being made but, credit where credit’s due, Bafta’s hit rate was almost impeccable. Of course Jamie Demetriou won best male comedy performance for Stath Lets Flats. For three seasons he has created less a performance and more a sheer gravitational force, terraforming an entire genre to his whims. And of course Matthew Macfadyen won best supporting actor for Succession. Because, for a performer once stereotyped as starched and staid, to see the full spectrum of colour he gave Tom Wambsgans – the tragedy and the duplicity, plus the pinpoint comic timing – is to see Macfadyen reach full capacity. So yes, with one exception the Baftas knocked it out of the park. And what a disastrous exception. It’s a Sin – the series that sauntered through the nominations as the year’s clearfrontrunner – came up short. In every single category. Its lack of success is genuinely bewildering. Not only was It’s a Sin an obvious labour of love for Russell T Davies, but it was a risk that paid off in almost every regard. Critics swooned at its feet and people watched it in swathes. It’s a Sin was the popular choice. It was the intellectual choice. It was even the political choice; because surely if you wanted to rub mud in the eye of anyone thinking of privatising Channel 4, you have no better weapon than a blockbuster series about the AIDS crisis. And yet, nothing. Now, we should probably be clear that this doesn’t represent a grand conspiracy. I’ve sat on Bafta juries before, and they’re all isolated. There wasn’t word from on high that It’s a Sin needed to be punished. What happened is that, in every single category that contained a nomination for It’s a Sin, a different group of people snubbed it. Who knows why. Perhaps they thought the show had already got enough love, and chose to put the spotlight on a less visible series. Maybe each category assumed It’s a Sin would walk every other category. Who knows? But whatever the reason, the defining television series of 2021 is now one of the least recognised. Which isn’t to say the shows that beat it are undeserving. Time, which won best mini-series, was tight and urgent and contained two stupendous performances at its heart. Sean Bean (who won best actor) was incredible in it, just as Jodie Comer (who won best actress) was incredible in Help. It isn’t as if It’s a Sin was egregiously robbed by an unworthy competitor. But not to won anything at all? That just makes Bafta look foolish. But this is a snubs and surprises piece, and not all surprises are bad. Who would have thought, going into this ceremony, that Big Zuu would emerge as one of the biggest winners? Zuu won twice, for best features and best entertainment performance, for Big Zuu’s Big Eats. If you haven’t seen Big Eats, this should be all the encouragement you need. It’s the kick in the arse that the cookery genre urgently required, and Big Zuu is one of the most likable, engaging faces on TV. Big Eats currently airs on Dave, but if this news doesn’t initiate a Taskmaster-style feeding frenzy then something will have gone terribly wrong. Whether you’d heard of him or not before now, it has become undeniable. Big Zuu is a star. It was also great to see some recognition for Together and Alma’s Not Normal. But, really, when anyone thinks of the 2022 television Baftas, they’re destined to only remember the staggering failure to recognise one of the defining shows in all of Channel 4 history. It’s a Sin was robbed and, well, it’s a sin.",Arts/Television & radio,‘A staggering failure’: the biggest shock of the 2022 TV Baftas (and there was really only one),https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/08/a-staggering-failure-the-biggest-shock-of-the-2022-tv-baftas-and-there-was-really-only-one
5/9/2022,"Good morning. Early voting in the federal election opens today. If you’re unable to get to the polls on 21 May, you can now cast your vote at one of the 500 voting centres across the country. Here’s everything you need to know.Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese bickered over electricity prices, national security and a federal integrity commission in a very messy leaders’ debate, described as “a genuine shit blizzard”. There was no clear winner for the second debate of the election campaign, with Channel Nine’s “viewer verdict” initially naming Morrison the winner, then Albanese, before the result came in at a 50-50 tie. “Unless you crave a bit of biff, or a bout of freestyle jelly wrestling, I’m confident the dialogue between Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese would have been completely incomprehensible for any voter looking for information ahead of the opening of pre-poll voting on Monday,” writes Katharine Murphy. Sixty people are feared to have been killed after a village school in eastern Ukraine took a direct hit in a Russian air raid, with rescue attempts said by the regional governor to be impossible due to constant shelling. It comes hours after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with G7 leaders overnight to discuss the war in Ukraine and new measures to punish Moscow, including sanctions from the US. The G7 group said Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has brought shame on Russia and the sacrifices its people made to defeat Nazi Germany in the second world war, marking the 77th anniversary of the end of the global conflict. High-achieving students who want to become teachers will be given at least $10,000 a year to study education under a Labor plan to improve teacher quality. It’s part of a package that will aim to double the number of high achievers studying to become teachers over the next decade, from about 1,800 to 3,600 a year. Meanwhile, attack ads targeting Labor are being published without any authorisation or party attribution on the Chinese-language social networking platform WeChat, raising concerns that misinformation could be circulating without oversight. An Australian soldier alleged by three newspapers to have participated with Ben Roberts-Smith in the “joint criminal enterprise” of murdering an Afghan villager named Ali Jan is set to appear in the federal court this week as a witness for Roberts-Smith in his defamation action against the newspapers. Person 11 is expected to deny all wrongdoing, and to back Roberts-Smith’s account that the man killed in Darwan – purported to be Ali Jan – was an enemy spotter legitimately killed, as the court has heard in previous evidence. Melbourne boxer Khalid Baker, who spent 13 years in prison after being convicted of murder, is launching a new appeal, arguing that a co-accused who was acquitted was responsible for the death and has confirmed he was not involved. The days of frenzied auction bidding in Australia’s housing market may be numbered with the recent interest rate hike and a slowing market.

What do you do with books you don’t want any more? There doesn’t seem to be one easy answer, writes James Colley. “At some point, I crossed the line from reader to hoarder and I need to go back … I know I’m never going back to finish them ... But coming to terms with this psychologically is only part of the battle. There’s now a bigger and much more practical question: what do you do with books you don’t want any more?” Requests for no-talking haircuts are becoming so common that some salons even provide pre-treatment questionnaires about the practice.

As always, there was a certain insouciance, a hint of menace. He looked like he’d spent the last month squatting and scowling.” Former Opals captain Jenna O’Hea has spoken about the incident which prompted Liz Cambage’s messy exit from the national program, alleging unconfirmed claims the star told her Nigerian rivals to “go back to your third-world country” are true.

5/9/2022,"One horse from the Aidan O’Brien stable replaced another on Sunday at the top of the market for the Derby next month, as Stone Age was cut to 3-1 favourite for the Classic following an easy win in Leopardstown’s Derby Trial just half an hour after the trainer had ruled out Luxembourg, third in last month’s 2,000 Guineas, due to a muscular problem. Stone Age, sent off favourite at 10-11, made most of the running under Ryan Moore and was a couple of lengths ahead turning for home. When Moore asked him for a finishing kick he quickly moved further clear of his field, eventually crossing the line five-and-a-half lengths clear of Glory Daze, an 18-1 outsider. It was O’Brien’s 15th success in the Leopardstown trial, though only two of his previous winners – Galileo and High Chaparral in 2000 and 2001 respectively – have followed up at Epsom. “I’ve always liked the horse,” Moore said afterwards. “He was very impressive at Navan and he’s beginning to put it together now. I think today’s trial was a good race and I think he’ll probably improve again, so he’s a very exciting colt. “He gave me a very good feel at Navan and he gave me a very good feel as a two-year-old, he ran in the [Group One] Lagardere at seven [furlongs] on bad ground and he wasn’t beaten far and wouldn’t have been seen to best effect in the conditions.” Stone Age was cut from 12-1 to a general 3-1 for the Derby on 4 June after Sunday’s race and seems sure to start favourite for the Classic unless Sir Michael Stoute’s Desert Crown (6-1) puts up an equally emphatic performance in the Dante Stakes at York on Thursday.

5/9/2022,"How do you mend a broken heart? Not literally, that is. If you’re Manchester City, your solution to a broken heart would probably be to spend £30m on hiring the 50 best heart surgeons in the world to defibrillate it for the next 10 years. But emotionally speaking, the time-honoured way of getting over a recent trauma is to surround yourself with loved ones, throw yourself into your work and rediscover the simple pleasures in life, which in City’s case usually involves dishing out merciless spankings to bottom-half Premier League sides. Here it was the unfortunate Newcastle United who would be City’s boxercise class, their family‑sized tub of Häagen‑Dazs, their 3am booty call to a long-lost ex. Of course the pall of Madrid hung over the afternoon. How could it not? It was less than 96 hours since their bone-chilling late defeat in the Champions League semi-final, and even as the goals rained in at the Etihad Stadium there was a strangely dolorous mood to the place, perhaps akin to the finger buffet at your grandmother’s funeral. Delicious, wholesome, but can you really fully enjoy a chicken balti pie when Nana is lying eight feet away in an open casket? The Newcastle fans chanted about City’s wasted Champions League chance, gleefully scratching away at that open wound. In truth, it probably didn’t help them. There was an interesting turn of phrase in Pep Guardiola’s programme notes where he briefly reflected on the Real Madrid defeat before adding: “But now we are back here with our people.” It was evidence of the fort mentality he has been trying to generate since he arrived in Manchester – with mixed success, it has to be said. You realised now why he had spoken so openly about his devastation in his Friday press conference, why he had insisted City could live with this defeat, but never forget it. All afternoon you could see him waving his arms on the touchline like a hype man, trying to stir the crowd into a scalded frenzy. But the Etihad Stadium crowd does not give its noise unconditionally. Partly this is because of the sizeable tourist contingent, a continuing problem at many big clubs. Mostly, though, it’s because crowds are at their best in the teeth of adversity and over the last few seasons you could probably count on your fingers the number of times this stadium has encountered genuine adversity. Instead, the default temperature of the Etihad Stadium drifts between three states: grumbling irritation, boisterous triumphalism and a kind of white noise – the noise of 600 completed passes at a 92% success rate, the noise of frictionless existence. In the early stages, it was grumbling irritation that was holding sway. Aymeric Laporte and João Cancelo missed big chances. So did Chris Wood for Newcastle. Raheem Sterling settled any residual nerves with a simple opening goal. But Newcastle were still able to work the ball up the field with consummate ease, still able to win too many second balls in midfield, very often just a good pass away from cutting City open entirely. Around half an hour in, though, something funny happened. Kevin De Bruyne looked up from his position in the left channel, made a brief set of calculations and played a gorgeous cross to Gabriel Jesus at the back post. Jesus couldn’t do anything with it, but De Bruyne’s sorcery instantly seemed to awaken something deep and elemental within the stadium. A reminder of what City are good at. A reminder of the power they still possess. Perhaps even a reminder of why they all do this. This, as much as anything he can physically do with a football, is De Bruyne’s talent. For all their individual excellence City possess vanishingly few players with the ability to turn the mood of a game, to get a crowd on its feet, to change the weather. Actually, that’s not quite true. Riyad Mahrez can do it. Phil Foden can do it. Jack Grealish at his best can certainly do it. The problem is that they so rarely get the latitude to do so: triple‑teamed by defenders, shackled to an intricate masterplan that essentially demands very fast ball retention. De Bruyne, you feel, is almost unique in this respect: the player who more than anyone seems to be the emotional centre of this team. When he’s buzzing, City are buzzing. When he disappears, even if they’re winning, something feels cold and disconsolate about them. It certainly does not feel coincidental that he failed to finish either of City’s last two Champions League exits: taken off after 72 flagging minutes in Madrid, knocked out by Antonio Rüdiger in the final against Chelsea last year. Each time City continued to compete, continued to generate chances. But something was missing: the thrill, the teeth, the implication that at any moment something might be conjured from nothing. Crisis over, then? It always felt faintly ludicrous, this debate over whether a team about to win their fourth title in five years have somehow failed or fallen short. Likewise the insistence of many City fans that they remain somehow cursed by bad luck, trodden underfoot, the victims of some establishment conspiracy. For all the chagrin of midweek, they’ve just beaten Newcastle 5-0, they get to watch De Bruyne play every week and they’re about to win the Premier League. They’ll be fine for now.",Sport/Football,City fans reminded of healing powers of De Bruyne and likely league title | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/08/manchester-city-healing-powers-kevin-de-bruyne-likely-league-title
5/9/2022,"BBC prison drama Time was the big winner at the 2022 television Baftas on Sunday, landing best miniseries and best actor for Sean Bean, in an in-person ceremony where social issues took centre stage. In another triumph for social realism, Help, about the care home crisis during the Covid-19 pandemic, won two awards. Jodie Comer won best actress for her role as a care worker, taking her second Bafta after winning for her role in Killing Eve in 2019, while best supporting actress went to Cathy Tyson for her portrayal of a resident. Speaking after she received her award, Comer said the show had enabled her to “realise the power we have in the stories we tell and that we choose to tell, and [the importance of] not shying away from difficult subject matters”. Collecting the award for Time as best miniseries, Stephen Graham praised “a phenomenal cast of young working-class men”, adding that they had made the show “an absolutely joy to be a part of”. Graham, who played a prison officer in the drama, said that as a child he had dreamed of working on “stories with a social commentary”. Tyson used her speech to thank Channel 4: “I remember being a teenager when Channel 4 was born and it had so many good things to do with it like diversity and it was a voice for people who were unheard at the time.” The other big winner was Big Zuu, who collected his two Baftas for best feature and entertainment performance for Big Zuu’s Big Eats with a look of incredulity. “This is mad, this is actually not normal,” he told a press conference. He made the case for representation in a powerful speech. “Mans come from humble beginnings. Representation is so important. Growing up, there weren’t many chefs or people that looked like me on telly. And now there’s young people watching us doing our ting thinking you know what? If these wastemen can win a Bafta, surely we can!” Sunday’s ceremony in the Royal Festival Hall in London’s South Bank marked the first in-person awards since 2019 as well as the television Baftas’ 75th anniversary. Crowds gathered on nearby Hungerford Bridge as stars of British television gathered on the red carpet. Setting the tone for the rest of the night, Bafta chair Krishnendu Majumdar opened the show with a political speech in which he made a powerful case for public service broadcasting in a direct challenge to the government’s plans to privatise Channel 4, as well as praising colleagues’ work in Ukraine and calling for more diversity among decision-makers in the industry. In the international category, Amazon Prime’s The Underground Railroad, an adaptation of Colston Whitehead’s Pulitzer-prize-winning novel about escaping slavery, beat off tough competition from hit shows Succession, Mare of Easttown, Squid Game and Call My Agent. In a winners’ press conference, actor Sheila Atim praised the counsellors on set for looking after cast members’ wellbeing. “It’s a real testament to the fact you can have really safe and protective work environment while still creating brilliant work.” In a further echo of this ceremony’s focus on topical social issues, Steve McQueen took home a Bafta in the factual category after missing out on an award for Small Axe last year, for his documentary Uprising, about the New Cross fire of 1981, which foreshadowed future racial injustices including Grenfell. McQueen told a press conference that for too long “black British history has been swept beneath the carpet”. He also made an impassioned plea for Channel 4 to help sustain UK creativity. “Other people have more money than us, the Americans, but we have great ideas and that’s what makes us who we are.” In another signal of the importance of inclusion on television, the reader-voted Virgin Media Must-see Moment went to Strictly Come Dancing for when contestant Rose Ayling-Ellis, who is deaf, danced with partner Giovanni Pernice in silence. She said was thrilled that her dance had led to “better deaf awareness”. “We’ve still got a long way to go but it’s such a great start,” she said. However, the 1980s-set Aids drama It’s a Sin, which had six nominations, the most of any show, failed to win any awards. The creators of lockdown drama Together, starring Sharon Horgan and James McAvoy, which won best drama, used their speech to read a statement from Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, who said they had been “ignored, lied to and gaslighted by a government seemingly too busy partying”, and called for a Covid inquiry to be launched. Matthew Macfadyen took home the award for best supporting actor for his role in Succession. Creator Jesse Armstrong accepted the award, telling a press conference that his chemistry with actor Nicholas Braun had been written in the script, but was chiefly due to the fact “the actors like working together and they feed off it and we feed off how they perform it and it’s a happy merry-go-round”. For scripted feature, Motherland took its first Bafta win for its final series. Gogglebox took home best reality and constructed factual, while best drama series went to teen angst series In My Skin. The best comedy performances went to Jamie Demetriou in the male category for Channel 4’s Stath Lets Flats, while Sophie Willan accepted her trophy in an expletive-laden speech for her role in BBC Two’s Alma’s Not Normal. Mo Gilligan, who took home the award for best comedy entertainment programme for The Lateish Show, said he owed his career to Channel 4 taking a chance on him. “I went to lots of meetings and they said: “You’re good but we don’t know what to do with you …” It’s really important we do save Channel 4 and use this platform to say it.”",Arts/Television & radio,TV Baftas 2022: Time wins best miniseries as social issues take spotlight,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/08/baftas-2022-time-wins-best-miniseries-as-social-issues-take-spotlight
