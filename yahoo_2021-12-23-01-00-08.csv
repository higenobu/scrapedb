Just under a year ago, 22-year-old Maddison Peel was working at a McDonald's in Kentucky, where she was paid $12 an hour. Now, she says she makes between $5,000 and $10,000 a month by posting food recipes on TikTok. Better known by her handle @MaddisonsKitchen, Peel began amassing her following after she posted a TikTok of a roasted chicken to the song ""Up"" by Cardi B. One week after the video went viral, she quit her job at McDonald's and started pursuing content creation full-time. ""I know that's probably not responsible,"" Peel told Insider.

12/23/2021,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam is scheduled to witness the opening Wednesday of a time capsule from 1887 that was buried under a towering statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Richmond. The massive bronze equestrian statue of Lee — long seen as a symbol of racial injustice in the former capital of the Confederacy — was taken down in September. The time capsule was found Friday by crews working to remove the pedestal where the Lee statue had stood. The square box was embedded in a 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) granite block. Julie Langan, the director of the state's Department of Historic Resources, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the box was removed from the granite Tuesday. A newspaper article from 1887 suggests the capsule contains Civil War memorabilia and a “picture of Lincoln lying in his coffin,” although historians believe it’s doubtful the picture is an actual photograph, which would be rare and valuable. Records from the Library of Virginia suggest that 37 Richmond residents, organizations and businesses contributed about 60 objects to the capsule, many of which are believed to be related to the Confederacy. “We’re hoping it hasn’t been damaged by water over the last 100-plus years,” Clark Mercer, Northam’s chief of staff, said Friday. The Lee statue was erected in 1890. It's removal in September came more than a year after Northam ordered that it be taken down following protests that erupted after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The day after the statue was removed, work crews spent more than 12 hours searching for the time capsule in the 40-foot-tall (12-meter-tall) pedestal but were unable to locate it. The Lee statue was one of five Confederate tributes along Richmond’s Monument Avenue and the only one that belonged to the state. The four city-owned statues were taken down in 2020, but the Lee statue removal was blocked by two lawsuits until a ruling from the Supreme Court of Virginia in September cleared the way for it to be taken down. Northam, a Democrat, announced earlier this month that the enormous pedestal would be removed, a reversal from September, when the governor said the pedestal would stay in place so its future could be determined by a community-driven effort to reimagine Monument Avenue. After Floyd’s killing in 2020, the Lee statue became a focal point of the racial justice movement in Richmond. Since then, the pedestal has been covered in graffiti, some of it profane and much of it denouncing the police. Some activists wanted to see it remain in place as a work of protest art.",U.S./Associated Press,1887 time capsule found at base of Lee statue to be opened,https://news.yahoo.com/1887-time-capsule-found-lee-150415470.html
12/23/2021,"Inspired mostly by curiosity, a couple of weeks ago I clicked on an invitation to join Donald Trump’s new social media app, called Truth Social. It’s being promoted as a “Big Tent social media platform that encourages an open, free, and honest global conversation without discriminating against political ideology.” I dutifully filled in all the blanks on the form — name, address, phone number, email — until I got to the part that asked me to click on the amount that I wanted to donate. The boxes started at $35 and went all the way up to $10,000. (According to the fine print, donations go to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.) On account of my job, I don’t donate to politicians or political causes. Nor do I sign petitions. Some of the newspaper colleagues I’ve worked with over the years don’t even vote — at least not for the people they write about — because they believe that would compromise their ability to be objective in their reporting. So, no, I wasn’t about to pay to join the inner circle of Truth Socializers — especially since it costs nothing to sign up for the waiting list for the app, which is expected to start up the first quarter of 2022. I declined to enter a credit card number, closed the form, and naively figured that would be the end of it. Boy was I wrong. The Trump machine doesn’t give up; in fact, its performance is even more impressive than those telemarketers warning us that our Social Security number has been hacked. (Don’t believe that. It’s a scam.) Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve been getting as many as seven texts per day — all on my personal phone — from team Trump. Here’s a sample: “WOW. Don’t ignore Trump’s PERSONAL message, Stephanie. We NEED you to step up to save our nation from Biden’s presidency.” “Stephanie, don’t make us tell Trump you’re IGNORING his dinner invitation. There’s still time. Enter to win.” “Why haven’t you taken the Election Year Poll? Are you becoming a Democrat?” “Stephanie, you STILL didn’t sign Trump’s Christmas card!” “Stephanie, have you ABANDONED Trump? Fix your reputation.” “It’s Don Jr.: I told my father he could count on YOUR support to restore his Majority in 2022. Contribute here.” “It’s Ted Cruz: We are just ONE SEAT away from taking back the GOP Majority.” “Stephanie, we need 82 more responses from your area — take our election year poll HERE. “CONGRATS! Stephanie we extended your chance to WIN a set of Melania Trump’s White House ornaments! Enter in the next 15 MIN.” As you probably guessed, a donation was required in order to take the poll, sign Trump’s Christmas card or have a chance to win Melania’s ornaments, which, I’m told, are the EXACT ornaments that hung in the Trump White House. But hey, I was able to gain access to an EXCLUSIVE video for TOP PATRIOTS. It turned out to be a brief message from Trump himself, thanking his audience for their love, affection and respect and promising the GOP would take back the Senate, the House and the White House “sooner than you think.” “The Republican Party is stronger than it’s ever been and it’s going to be a lot stronger than it is right now,” Trump says in the “exclusive” video. That’s pretty much it. Not even a Merry Christmas or a Happy New Year. Just more posturing. If this is a preview of Truth Social, so much for the promise of a Big Tent. So much for encouraging open, free and honest conversation. So much for welcoming people of “all political stripes” and “all different viewpoints.” So sorry, Don Jr. You too, Ted. Despite your persistence, I won’t be signing up for those holiday ornaments or for an opportunity to add my name to Trump’s Christmas card. It’s been fun, but I’m going to have to break up. The next text message you send me, I’m replying with “STOP.”",Politics/San Luis Obispo Tribune,I’ve been ignoring Trump’s ‘personal’ messages. Ted Cruz and Don Jr. aren’t happy,https://news.yahoo.com/ve-ignoring-trump-personal-messages-133000827.html
