4/9/2022,"(Adds deal closing details, background) April 8 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc's WarnerMedia unit and Discovery Inc have completed their merger, the companies said on Friday. The combined company, Warner Bros Discovery Inc, will start trading on the Nasdaq on Monday under the ticker symbol ""WBD"". In May last year, the companies set out to merge and become a standalone media business, with AT&T aiming to focus more on its wireless ambitions and Discovery looking to beef up its content library. ""With the close of this transaction, we expect to invest at record levels in our growth areas of 5G and fiber, where we have strong momentum,"" AT&T Chief Executive Officer John Stankey said in a statement. Warner Bros Discovery's portfolio includes Discovery Channel, Warner Bros. Entertainment, CNN, HBO, Cartoon Network; streaming services Discovery+ and HBO Max; and franchises like ""Batman"" and ""Harry Potter"". A top priority for David Zaslav, the long-time Discovery veteran leading the combined entity, is to make streaming video as profitable as the old TV business, analysts said. Discovery On Thursday announced the executive team to lead the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), leaning heavily on a trusted group of lieutenants, many of whom have worked with its chief executive since his days at NBC. Nine high-level WarnerMedia executives, including Chief Executive Jason Kilar and Studios and Network chief Ann Sarnoff, announced their exits ahead of the formation of the combined company earlier this week.

4/9/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Sanctions Against Putin’s Daughters, IMF Account Finland Hit by Cyber Attack, Airspace Breach as NATO Bid Weighed Nations Eye Modern Arms for Ukraine as Soviet-Era Stocks Dwindle DHL Jet Skids Off Runway, Breaks Up After Emergency Landing Canada to Ban Foreigners From Buying Homes as Prices Soar Russia’s first external default in a century now looks all but inevitable after another brutal week for the country’s finances. First, the Treasury halted dollar debt payments from Russia’s accounts in U.S. banks, ramping up its restrictions on the country. Then, when an attempted hard-currency payment was blocked, Russia breached the terms on two bonds by paying investors rubles instead of dollars. That pushed the countdown clock a step closer to default. It’s been ticking since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, and the U.S. and others swiped back with a clampdown on banks, companies and oligarchs. A freeze on the central bank’s foreign reserves unplugged Russia from the global financial system, making it the world’s most-sanctioned nation in a matter of days. With Vladimir Putin’s government hampered by asset blocks and branded a pariah by Western countries -- politically, economically and financially -- speculation has mounted that Russia would only be able to avoid a default for so long. The country’s bonds are already trading deep in distressed territory, and insurance on the debt now suggests almost a 90% chance that a default will happen this year, according to the latest figures from ICE Data Services. Russia last defaulted in 1998, but on domestic debt. The last one on foreign debt was in the aftermath of the 1917 revolution. S&P said Saturday that it had declared Russia in a selective default after it used rubles to make a payment on a dollar-denominated bond on April 4. There’s still uncertainty about what’s next and further twists can’t be ruled out. The dollar bonds that were serviced in rubles this week have 30-day grace periods, giving Finance Minister Anton Siluanov time to find a workaround or push his argument that this isn’t a default because a payment was technically made. This week he said the rubles transferred in lieu of dollars can be converted for creditors just as soon as the reserves freeze is eased. “Western countries are trying in every possible way to make Russia declare default,” Siluanov told state news service Tass this week. He also said Russia will use “other mechanisms” to make payments. In the meantime, the financial world waits for an official judgment on whether a default event has occurred. But where that decision comes from is unclear. After a string of cuts that pushed Russia deep into junk, ratings firms are abandoning coverage because of an EU ban on providing ratings to the country. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings have already withdrawn, S&P Global said in its statement Saturday that it will respect the April 15 EU ban and all its ratings on Russia were subsequently withdrawn. There’s also the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee of buy-side and sell-side firms that vote on whether a credit event has taken place and whether default swaps have been triggered. The committee is already reviewing a question on the possible default of the state-owned railway operator, which failed to pay bond interest on time in March. “If Russia does not manage to organize a payment route to bondholders within the grace period and no dollars arrive into the accounts, then it is a default, the CDS will trigger,” said Lutz Roehmeyer, chief investment officer at Berlin-based Capitulum Asset Management. Ever since the Feb. 24 invasion and the sweeping sanctions that followed, Russian debtors have struggled to get funds to creditors on time. Banks’ compliance departments pored over the payments with extra checks. Initially, the disruption was felt most in the corporate sector, and multiple businesses have failed to make bond payments on time. This week, Sovcombank PJSC became the first bank to say it will miss a payment on foreign-currency bonds. Then, the U.S. Treasury threw up a major hurdle for the sovereign by blocking access to bank accounts, effectively torpedoing a Treasury sanctions carve-out that had allowed bond payments to go ahead from Russia’s overseas accounts, despite the central bank reserve freeze. The decision to block that route to payment came after reports of Russian atrocities in the Ukrainian town of Bucha over the weekend. The move was designed to force Russia to tap into domestic sources of funding or hard-currency earnings from oil and gas exports, thus sapping the cash available for the government to further an invasion that’s destroyed cities, killed thousands, and displaced 11 million people. Economic Impact The bond market drama is playing out against a warped economic backdrop. On the one hand, the economy is sliding into deep recession. On the other, capital controls have underpinned an extraordinary rebound in the ruble that allowed the central bank to slash rates by 300 basis points this week in a surprise move. Even as Western nations race to reduce their reliance on Russian commodities, the country is still raking in billions of dollars from exports of oil and gas, keeping it flush with cash for now. Given those inflows, the government says it has the funds to pay creditors. It’s blamed payment issues on the central-bank asset freeze and the swirling uncertainly that accompanied it. According to Tim Ash, an emerging-markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, there will be no quick fix for Russia because sanctions are set to stay and no one will want to do business there. “Putin has crossed the rubicon with his actions in Ukraine,” he said. “Russia will be in default for perhaps a decade. That means no access to international capital markets, very high costs of borrowing even from the Chinese, no investment, no growth, low living standards. It’s a terrible outlook for Russia and Russians.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek China’s $2.3 Trillion Infrastructure Plan Puts America’s to Shame The Bridgewater CEO Who Went Full MAGA The 15-Minute Ultrafast Delivery Craze Slams Into Reality This Is the Red-Hot Center of the Tightest Job Market Since WWII How Greenwood Became the Most Hyped Startup in Black America ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",World/Bloomberg•6 hours ago,Russia’s First Default in a Century Looks All But Inevitable Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-first-default-century-looks-073000013.html

4/9/2022,"It’s the nature of investing to look for the ‘next new thing,’ the company or technology or product that will bring the next sea-change to its industry – and with it, windfall profits. A look at history will show that these developments are often unpredictable, but they can be recognized early. The advent of digital tech in the late 90s provides a good example of the possible gains and risks. The survivors of the dot.com bubble have prospered mightily. Now, artificial intelligence – AI, or machine learning – is poised to take the digital world to its next frontier. With applications in virtually every facet of the tech industry, from smartphones to robotics to data analytics, AI is going to change the way we interact with machines, with applications, and perhaps even with each other. The possibilities in this are endless, limited only to human imagination. For investors, this means that new opportunities are going to open up, as companies move to capitalize on AI through product creation, programming, hardware development – and perhaps AI’s biggest impact hasn’t been built yet. For now, however, we can look for firms that already have their hands in AI, either in their own work or in their products. We’ve taken two of these names and looked up their details in the TipRanks database. Both are Strong Buys, according to the Street’s analysts, with plenty of upside potential in store for 2022. Let's take a closer look. One Stop Systems (OSS) We’ll start with One Stop Systems, a provider of the high performance computers (HPCs) used in the highest-end data centers and data storage facilities. The company specifically markets its products for AI applications, offering portable, ruggedized servers and storage for ‘AI on the Fly.’ The company draws its customers from a wide range of sectors, including telecom, manufacturing, and defense. One Stop’s systems are used in both rack-scale multi-HPC server complexes, and in smaller, single-HPC servers. This past November, OSS released a new product for AI Transportable solutions. The Rigel Edge Supercomputer brings higher performance to compact deployments, using Nvidia’s HGX A100 4-GPU platform to power GPU-accelerated computing. The system is air-cooled, and only 25.6 inches in total depth. The company is also working on release of an even more compact, liquid-cooled, version of the Rigel. New products and a solid reputation for compact, transportable AI systems have worked together to bring OSS strong financial results. In the most recently reported quarter, 4Q21, the company had $17.8 million in total revenue, up 11% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. For the full year, the top line of $62 million was a company record – and up 19% from 2020. Full year non-GAAP EPS came in at 16 cents per share, double the 2020 net EPS. Looking ahead, One Stop is guiding toward 26% y/y revenue growth in 1Q22. In coverage for Roth Capital, 5-star analyst Scott Searle points out the company’s strong guidance, as well as its moves toward the autonomous vehicle market, a growing frontier for AI. “Appropriately overshadowing 4Q21 results is the upwardly revised 1Q22 outlook (up 26% y/y) which features a growing opportunity pipeline around AI transportables and autonomous vehicle applications which could open a $500M+ TAM in 2023... With high level engagements at multiple autonomous vehicle trucking and fleet applications we believe this could drive an inflection in the 2023-time frame beyond our upwardly revised expectations of 12.8% growth. Overall, we view this opportunity as potentially transformative for OSS... We are raising our sales estimates and would be buyers of this stealth AI and autonomous vehicle microcap,” Searle wrote. In line with these comments, the analyst gives One Stop’s shares a Buy rating, along with a $9 price target that implies a strong upside of ~131% for the next 12 months. (To watch Searle’s track record, click here) Overall, with 3 Buys and no Holds or Sells assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that OSS is a Strong Buy. The stock is selling for $3.90 per share, and its $8 average price target indicates a 105% upside by year’s end. (See OSS stock forecast on TipRanks) Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) The second stock we’ll look at needs no introduction. Nvidia, with a market cap of more than $600 billion and an 80%-plus market share in the GPU segment, is a dominant player in the gaming and data center sectors. The company’s GPU chips are in high demand, due to their computing capacity – which is capable of powering AI systems. Nvidia is deeply involved with AI companies and applications, supplying high-end GPU AI-capable semiconductors to companies involved in data centers, autonomous vehicles, intelligent factory robots, cloud computing – even ordinary desktop systems are coming with AI capabilities installed. The company provides deep learning chips to power cloud services from major names like Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. The company’s recent history, of 7 consecutive quarters showing sequential gains in both earnings and revenue, may help explain why analysts find the stock so compelling. The company’s 4Q21 EPS, at $1.32, beat the forecast (of $1.23) and rose 69% year-over-year, while the 4Q revenue grew 53% y/y, to reach $7.64 billion. Matt Ramsay, 5-star analyst from Cowen, is unabashedly bullish on Nvidia, writing: “AI computing opportunities are inflecting across essentially all vertical industries, lead by datacenter, enterprise, gaming, edge, auto, simulation... ultimately monetized through hardware and now vertical-specific software... We view NVIDIA as the premier AI-driven growth story in semis and possibly the tech industry."" Ramsay uses these comments, as part of an in-depth look at NVDA, to support his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock. His price target, of $350, suggests ~45% in store for the chip giant. (To watch Ramsay’s track record, click here) In recent weeks, no fewer than 26 Wall Street analysts have weighed in on this stock – giving it 21 Buys and 5 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $242.08 and their $351.74 nearly matches Ramsay’s objective, for a 45% one-year upside potential.
