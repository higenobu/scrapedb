3/23/2022,"The Lismore council was gripped by in-fighting on Tuesday night over whether it should make references to “climate change” following the flood disaster and an eleventh-hour decision to pause its work on flood mitigation, despite warnings the “optics” of doing so were “not good”. The disaster-ravaged town is still in the early stages of recovering from an unprecedented 14.37-metre flood, which wiped out thousands of homes and businesses and brought Lismore to its knees. On Wednesday, in a late-night sitting, Lismore council proposed a message of thanks to volunteers and the community for their efforts in the immediate response and clean-up effort. It included a line saying the council “acknowledges we are likely to experience further disasters of this nature as climate change continues to escalate”. The words “climate change” prompted a reaction from four councillors, led by independent councillor Big Rob, who attempted to have the reference removed and replaced with a line saying “we are definitely going to experience further disasters of this nature”. Rob – who says he does not deny climate change but likes to “stir up lefties” – said he did not think a message of community support was the right place to make “political” statements about climate change. “That motion was about thanking people, not being political about climate change,” he said. Rob was supported by three other councillors, including Andrew Gordon, who told the Guardian it was “piss poor” to add a climate change reference to a statement thanking the community.

But it rankled other councillors, including Greens councillor Adam Guise, who first proposed the climate change reference be added. “They tried to couch it as not politicising it,” Guise said . “But this is the whole thing about climate change, it’s not political, it’s science.” The dispute came amid further divisions within council over a decision to halt the work of a key committee working to improve flood mitigation measures in Lismore. That occurred despite councillors acknowledging the “optics” of pausing the flood mitigation committee so soon after a disaster were “not good”. The council has also sacked members of the Lismore community who were on a community reference group advising council on flood mitigation. Last night, at 11pm, the council decided to pause the work of the floodplain committee to wait for more information from CSIRO, which has been given $10m to explore flood mitigation measures in the region. Lismore council decided it should hold off doing any further work on flood mitigation of its own until it understood what CSIRO was doing. But councillor Vanessa Ekins, who chairs the committee, warned that could take months. She said pausing the committee was “very dangerous ground” and would not look good to Lismore residents. “We have just been through a big flood, we are still experiencing that and for us to send a message out there that we are pausing work that we have been working really hard on for years until we hear what the CSIRO are doing … they might take six months to tell us what they’re doing,” she said. “This could take a really, really long time and meanwhile our community has no guidance from us, we’re not doing anything, we’ve paused the consultation we’re currently engaged in until someone else tells us what they’re doing.” She said the decision was “absolutely outrageous”. “It’s really important that our flood plain committee continues the work that it’s been doing for the last five years on mitigating the impacts of flooding on the CBD and residences,” she said. “We were in the middle of a consultation process with members of the community about various options.” Others were furious that community members had been sacked from the committee so soon after the floods. “We had community members on that committee with five years’ experience and expertise in understanding the mitigation options that were before us,” councillor Elly Bird said. “To throw all of that experience away, I don’t support it.”",News/Australia news,Climate change spat splits Lismore council in flood aftermath,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/climate-change-spat-splits-lismore-council-in-flood-aftermath
3/23/2022,"Aged care workers are being priced out of their communities, with low wages and rising living costs leaving a worker in a typical two-parent household with $34 of disposable income each week, and a single parent full-time worker unable to cover basic expenses. The findings come from a report published on Wednesday by the Australian Aged Care Collaboration (AACC), a group of six aged care peak bodies. The report compared average wages for workers in the residential and home care sectors against key cost of living indicators including average rents, childcare expenses, grocery costs, and petrol. Expenses were then compared to income earned by a certificate III qualified personal care worker employed at the award rate for a 38-hour week, who would earn $900 a week, or $773 after tax. “Based on average earnings and expenses, an aged care worker in a single household would have $156 of income each week after basic expenses to cover other costs,” the report found. “An aged care worker in a single-parent household would not be able to cover even basic expenses without working extra hours, working late nights or weekends, and relying on additional government benefits. “An aged care worker in a typical two-parent household would have $34 of disposable income each week after expenses. These assumptions only cover basic weekly living costs.” The report said aged care workers in single households were likely in serious financial stress with little or no savings buffer, while aged care workers in coupled households were likely to be financially dependent on a partner’s income. “The results also reinforce concerns that aged care workers, like other frontline workers, are being priced out of housing,” the report concluded. “This helps explain why some aged care providers are being forced to offer housing options to attract staff.” It is also one of the factors contributing to workers leaving the profession, creating workforce shortages. Aged care services are competing for workers with the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the health system, and the community sector. “Each of these sectors is funded to offer higher pay to these workers,” the report said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ahead of the federal election, the AACC is calling on all parties and independent candidates to join representatives of older people and their carers, providers, unions, and health professionals to support the aged care workforce and push for key reforms. These include a minimum wage increase for aged care workers, an award wage increase from July, and a commitment to a multidisciplinary workforce by putting in place an allied health needs assessment and funding model by July 2024. The median hourly wage for a support worker is $28.41, and $28.99 for a home care worker. The median hourly wage for a bartender is $30, and $31.79 for a cashier. In February, nurses and other workers protested dangerous staff shortages, underpayment, and a lack of personal protective equipment – issues that persist more than two years after the Covid-19 pandemic began and despite numerous inquiries into the aged care sector.",News/Australia news,Aged care workers struggle to cover basics as low wages and rising living costs take toll,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/aged-care-workers-struggle-to-cover-basics-as-low-wages-and-rising-living-costs-take-toll
3/23/2022,"Hillsong’s founding pastor, Brian Houston, has resigned from the megachurch he founded in Sydney two decades ago after internal investigations found he had engaged in inappropriate conduct of “serious concern” with two women. Houston stood down last Friday, but following another emergency staff meeting on Wednesday the Sydney-based church issued a brief statement announcing his resignation. “We would like to advise you that Pastor Brian Houston has resigned as Global Senior Pastor of Hillsong Church and the board has accepted his resignation. “We understand there will be much emotion at this news, and we all share these feelings. Irrespective of the circumstances around this, we can all agree that Brian and Bobbie have served God faithfully over many decades and that their ministry has resulted in millions of people across the world being impacted by the power, grace, and love of Jesus Christ.” Over two decades, Hillsong grew from a small church in Sydney to a global brand with over 150,000 weekly attendees at its churches in 25 countries. Its brand of Christianity, which focused on rock concert-type services and attracting celebrity parishioners, proved enormously popular. Wednesday’s statement noted that Hillsong Church “was birthed” out of Brian and and his wife, Bobbie’s “commitment to the call of God” and asked congregants to pray for the entire Houston family “during this challenging time”. Last week Hillsong confirmed in a statement and in an extraordinary meeting involving 800 staff members that it was investigating two complaints about inappropriate conduct involving Houston, one from a decade ago and another from 2019. The statement revealed that alcohol and prescription drugs had also been implicated in the behaviour. “We have sadly been dealing with two complaints made against Pastor Brian over the last 10 years,” the board said last week. At the time Houston had already stepped down from the board and from the ministry, citing unrelated reasons. In a statement on Saturday, the church said the first incident “involved inappropriate text messages” sent to a female member of staff. The woman subsequently resigned. “At the time, Pastor Brian was under the influence of sleeping tablets, upon which he had developed a dependence. He immediately apologised to the person. We also worked closely with Pastor Brian to ensure he received professional help to eliminate his dependency on this medication, and this was achieved successfully.” According to the statement the second issue involved a complaint received in 2019. Following an in-depth investigation, it was found that Houston became disoriented after a session at the Hillsong conference following the consumption of anti-anxiety medication beyond the prescribed dose along with alcohol. This resulted in him knocking on the door of a hotel room that was not his, entering this room and spending time with the female occupant. “The investigation by the integrity unit appointed by the global board found that although all parts of the complaint were unable to be sustained, important elements of the complaint were sustained and the conduct was of serious concern,” the board said “Ultimately, the board found that Brian had breached the Hillsong Pastor’s Code of Conduct. We apologise unreservedly to the people affected by Pastor Brian’s actions and commit to being available for any further assistance we can provide.” Houston was a close friend and spiritual guide to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, a fellow pentecostal. Morrison thanked Houston in his maiden speech to parliament and more recently was asked about whether he tried to get Houston an invitation to a White House dinner while he was in Washington. Wednesday’s statement said Hillsong had committed to an independent review of its governance and structure and processes. The statement said the church was praying for Houston. Comment is being sought from Houston.",News/World news,Hillsong’s Brian Houston resigns from megachurch,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/hillsongs-brian-houston-resigns-from-megachurch
3/23/2022,"A woman who had an affair with Ben Roberts-Smith has told a court she was confronted by a stranger who showed her photos of her having sex with Roberts-Smith in a hotel room, and threatened to make them public if she didn’t confess the affair to the veteran’s wife. The woman, anonymised before the court as Person 17, gave evidence about the torrid end of her affair with Roberts-Smith to the federal court Wednesday morning, saying she was “scared” he would “seek payback”. “I was simultaneously in love with him and afraid of him.” Roberts-Smith, a Victoria Cross recipient and one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. In her evidence Tuesday, Person 17 told the court that after a function at Parliament House on 28 March 2018, Roberts-Smith had punched her in the face in anger, sending her falling on to a bed and giving her a black eye. Days later, on 3 April, she said she was walking on a beach near her home in the early morning when she was approached by a man she didn’t recognise. The man showed her pictures on his phone of her having sex with Roberts-Smith in a hotel room in the Brisbane suburb of Milton. The hotel was one Person 17 and Roberts-Smith visited regularly, and the photographs, the court heard, appeared to have been taken from outside the window. Person 17 told the court the man told her to declare the affair to Roberts-Smith’s wife. “He said ‘you’ve been seeing Ben Roberts-Smith’. He showed me the photos. I was to tell Emma (Roberts – Roberts-Smith’s then-wife) about the affair or the photos would be made public.” Three days later, on 6 April, Person 17 drove to the Roberts-Smith marital home on the Sunshine Coast and told Emma Roberts she had been having an affair with her husband. Person 17 contacted Roberts-Smith in the hours after being confronted with the photos on the beach, but did not mention them to him. Under cross-examination, she was asked why she did not tell him about the confrontation on the beach. Bruce McClintock, acting for Roberts-Smith, suggested his client would have a “lively interest” in photographs of himself engaged in an extramarital affair. “I didn’t trust him (Roberts-Smith) … I thought he might have been involved with it,” Person 17 told the court. “Someone had approached me with compromising photographs of us together and I was really afraid of what I was caught up in. I was really paranoid and fearful.” The court has heard extensive evidence about the tempestuous nature of the six-month affair between Person 17 and Roberts-Smith over 2017 and 2018, which she says was riven by mistrust, deception and confrontations. Person 17 said Roberts-Smith threatened her. She described to the court “veiled threats”, including that the soldier said he could track her movements, and access her bank accounts and phone, warning he was “not someone you’d want to get on the wrong side of”.

It might not be you that gets hurt, it might be people that you love and care about.” Person 17 said she had a black eye when she visited the Roberts-Smith home on 6 April 2018, a little over a week after the alleged assault in Canberra. She said Emma Roberts’s mother, who was also at the house, asked her “what happened to your face?”, and said “he did that to you,” meaning Roberts-Smith. Person 17 denied this, and said she had fallen down the stairs in a drunken accident. “No you didn’t, I’ve seen injuries like that before,” Person 17 said Roberts’s mother replied. Person 17 said she lied about the cause of the black eye because she feared retribution from Roberts-Smith. “I knew that I would be targeted by him.” McClintock said Person 17’s decision to visit the Roberts-Smith family home was a “straight-out act of vindictive revenge”. “What you really wanted was to end my client’s marriage so you could have him for yourself?,” McClintock said. “No,” Person 17 said. McClintock focused on affectionate and explicit text messages sent between Person 17 and Roberts-Smith, which included kiss emojis and declarations of love. “Looking at those messages, you cannot seriously say you were intimidated by my client?” McClintock asked. “I was simultaneously in love with him and afraid of him,” Person 17 said. Roberts-Smith was questioned on the alleged incident at the Canberra hotel during his testimony before the court last year. He denied all allegations of violence or threatening behaviour, saying the allegations were “completely false”. “The whole story is a fabrication,” he told the court. “I’ve never hit a woman. I never would hit a woman. And I certainly never hit Person 17.” Roberts-Smith said Person 17 sustained the injuries to her face and side when she fell down the stairs at Parliament House. He said he did not believe she needed to go to hospital, and he took her to the hotel room where he undressed her, put an icepack on her head and put her to bed. He said he checked her respiratory rate and pulse and stayed awake all night checking she was OK. Person 17 remains in the witness box. The trial, before justice Anthony Besanko, continues, and is expected to run several weeks more.",News/Australia news,"Woman threatened by stranger with photos of her and Ben Roberts-Smith having sex, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/woman-threatened-by-stranger-with-photos-of-her-and-ben-roberts-smith-having-sex-court-told
