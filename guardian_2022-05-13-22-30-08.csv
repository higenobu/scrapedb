5/13/2022,"Corfu town wears its Venetian influences proudly in pastel, while the Kommeno peninsula is covered with olives and pines Corfu is the northernmost island on the blissful Ionian. On its east coast, two mighty Venetian-era fortresses guard its Unesco-listed eponymous capital. Here cobbled alleys reveal pastel-coloured palazzi, quaint churches, old-fashioned cafes and traditional tavernas serving local fare. Its centrepiece is the Liston, an arcaded walkway overlooking the vast green Spianada, where locals play cricket on summer evenings – a custom dating from the 19th century, when Corfu was a British protectorate for a period of almost 50 years. Beyond Corfu town, the coast yields to translucent waters, and sand and pebble beaches. The rugged interior is planted with olive groves, many dating back more than half a millennia, from which Corfu produces some of Greece’s best olive oil. Hike the lower slopes of Mount Pantokrator, to Old Perithia, a village of 14th-century stone cottages, some now restored, to see how rural life once looked. The luxurious Grecotel Corfu Imperial has villas with private pools, a rocky coastline to explore and classical landscaped gardens Just over seven miles north of the city of Corfu is Kommeno, a lush peninsula, clad with silvery-green olive groves, fragrant pines, elegant cypresses and exotic palms. Here the five-star Grecotel Corfu Imperial offers the island’s most opulent accommodation. Expect refined rooms, suites, bungalows and waterside villas with private pools sleeping up to 12 guests. Each is unique, some built in minimalist contemporary style, while others borrow from Corfu’s lavish Venetian tradition, with pastel-coloured facades, balustraded balconies and terracotta-tile roofs. Guests can explore the resort’s rocky coast, interspersed with secret bays and beaches, and the landscaped gardens dotted with pools. On the main promenade is a choice of bars and restaurants serving fresh seafood and local seasonal produce, as well as the island’s cherished olive oil. Beaches, Unesco-listed temples and whitewashed houses – Mykonos has its own distinct identity Rising from the Aegean, the island of Mykonos is renowned for its hedonistic nightlife. Cosmopolitan Mykonos town is a warren of cobbled alleys, where whitewashed cubic houses, typical of the Cyclades, host cocktail bars, gourmet restaurants and chic boutiques. By day, glamorous sun-tanned guests snooze and bathe at the glorious long beaches of the south coast – and for sporty types, there’s also windsurfing, kite-surfing, waterskiing and scuba diving. After dark, several beaches host open-air dance clubs staging well-known DJs. From the harbour, daily excursion boats run to the rocky islet of Delos. Believed by the ancients to be the birthplace of Apollo (God of the sun) and Artemis (goddess of the moon), today its temples and proud stone lions are Unesco-listed. Inspired by Cycladic architecture, the Grecotel Mykonos Blu overlooks Psarou beach Overlooking the gorgeous Psarou beach on Mykonos’s sunny south coast, the Grecotel Mykonos Blu is the perfect summer escape. It has a lush spa and a sleek cave-like infinity pool built into the rocks. From here, steps lead down to the golden sands, and hotel guests get free sunbeds and beach towels. The hotel comprises bungalows, suites, and villas with sea views and private pools, inspired by traditional Cycladic architecture. Think Aegean-cool interiors, predominantly white with discrete blue details. Wake up to a generous Greek breakfast, enjoy a light sushi lunch, and close the day with a romantic sunset dinner on the beach, with a private waiter and personalised menu planning. A 15th-century fort guards Kos’s marina and harbour, while the island is popular with wind- and kitesurfers Kos town is known for its palm-lined avenues, big sailing marina, and the 15th-century Castle of Nerantzia, which guards the entrance to the port. Behind the town stands the hillside Asklipeon, a third-century BC sanctuary and healing temple. It was built in honour of Hippocrates, regarded as the father of medicine, who was born on Kos in 460BC. His famous tract, On Airs, Waters and Places, examined the relationship between health and environment – he believed we thrive on a good diet, fresh air, rest, exercise, cleanliness and a mild climate. Hippocrates would probably have approved of the eight-mile cycling lane that runs along the seafront in Kos town, from Psalidi beach to Faros beach. Much-loved by wind- and kitesurfers, Psalidi enjoys a steady side-shore wind, and has several windsurfing and kitesurfing schools, offering tuition and rental equipment. In the western part of the island, Plaka Forest is a haven of pine trees, fresh spring water, terrapins and dozens of peacocks – kids adore it. Mediterranean living at the family-friendly Grecotel LUX ME Kos Imperial In a spectacular location just outside Kos town, you’ll find the family-friendly Grecotel LUX ME Kos Imperial. Lying near Psalidi beach, it’s set in landscaped grounds with exotic tropical planting, freeform pools with cascades, a turquoise lagoon and a pebble beach. Outdoor activities include yoga, pilates, tennis, beach volley, windsurfing and scuba diving. There’s also a lush spa offering a wide choice of health and beauty treatments and an indoor heated pool, and an array of waterside bars and restaurants serving healthy Mediterranean menus and special options for kids. Accommodation ranges from elegant rooms and suites to bungalows and villas, all decorated to create a suitably leisurely island mood. Pools, palms and sea views at the Grecotel Amirandes Boutique Resort Some 5,000 years ago, there lived a sophisticated civilisation on Crete called the Minoans. Their main settlement was Knossos Palace, where they enjoyed beauty and leisure – the ruins of which you can still visit today. Built around a vast central courtyard, its rooms were decorated with magnificent frescoes, depicting the curious sport of bull leaping, as well as dolphins, blue birds and lilies. It also had storerooms for gigantic amphora – ceramic storage vessels – filled with olive oil and wine. The fields surrounding the site still support lush vineyards, some reviving almost-forgotten indigenous grape varieties. Inland, Crete’s mountains are reputed to be the birthplace of Zeus Nearby, on the coast, Heraklion was originally Knossos’s port, and in the 15th century it was fortified by the Venetians, who also added elegant churches and fountains. At Heraklion Archaeological Museum, you can see ancient finds from Knossos, such as frescoes, painted ceramics and gold jewellery. Inland there are dramatic mountains – the ancients believed that Zeus, king of the gods, was born in a cave on the highest, Mt Ida (2,456m). Set amid careful landscaping with pools, a lagoon and blissful beaches, the Grecotel Amirandes lies on Crete’s north coast, 14 miles east of Heraklion. A family-friendly resort, it offers activities associated with a healthy, active lifestyle that the Minoans would have admired. On-site you have yoga, aerobics, tennis and kayaking, plus nearby scuba diving and mountain biking. Sophisticated dining options include Italian and East Asian fare, but the highlight is rustic Cretan cuisine, prepared from fresh local ingredients and organic produce from Grecotel’s own Agreco Farm. Accommodation ranges from rooms and suites to bungalows and villas – the best come with a private garden, infinity pool, and direct access to the sands with private beach cabanas.

5/13/2022,"When is a Chanel jacket not a Chanel jacket? When it is a collarless jacket in a ladylike pastel tweed, with a boxy shape accentuated by shiny gold buttons on four patch pockets – but the label says Mango. Or when it is an unstructured hip-length textured blazer in a soft-focus check, with pearl-effect buttons – but it’s £59.99 at Zara. The soft tweed jacket that Coco Chanel made famous has become a bread-and-butter look for fashion retailers all over the world. Not that the Chanel name is openly invoked, of course. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but lawyers are immune to sweet talk, so the name is absent from other retailers’ descriptions of their nubbly blazers with fancy buttons. (By the way, it is not just high street copies Chanel is offended by: Saint Laurent’s tweed-suit-based catwalk show last year sparked a public row, with Chanel calling Saint Laurent a “parasite” – although the two have since issued a joint statement condemning plagiarism.) The jacket is a victim of its own success. Created in 1954, it is now instantly recognisable – no need for logo or monogram. Spot a certain type of jacket in the wild, and the name Chanel will pop into your head long before you’re close enough to tell whether the buttons are embossed with interlocking Cs. The basic grammar of the look – textured woven surface, perhaps with a metallic thread; statement buttons; supple, cardigan softness – is clearly legible. This is a chameleon piece that can play tough or sweet, happy or serious. Keira Knightley got married in an ivory one; Jackie Onassis wore a black one, with matching gloves, to the funeral of Cardinal Cushing. Kate Moss wears hers to the pub, with jeans; Amal Clooney wears hers to court. And while it has never gone out of style, the jacket works particularly well with clothes you may be drawn to in 2022. A soft, boxy jacket makes this season’s miniskirt feel wearable and grown-up. It adds instant polish to a pair of vintage jeans. And for holidays, a jacket that is instantly fancy but as comfortable as a sweater comes into its own. (Rihanna has been known to pair a Chanel jacket with trackie bottoms for flying.) Rarely has a garment so chic been so comfy. Coco herself used to have her showroom models cross their arms and rest each hand on the opposite shoulder while wearing the jacket, to be sure the cut allowed them to move freely. But it has a je ne sais quoi that prompts lavish politeness in shop assistants. Tweed is warm but breathable, so takes the edge off a cool day but you won’t overheat if the sun comes out. The boneless shape makes it light to carry, and crease-proof. Should you be wondering – yes, a real Chanel jacket is most definitely superior to a mass-produced lookalike. The unstructured softness that gives such an air of nonchalance is achieved by careful, if invisible, construction. A metal chain is sewn into the hem of a Chanel jacket to add weight and help it drop neatly and evenly, rather than sagging. The bouclé tweed of the real thing is twisted and looped so the surface stays in good condition for years; cheaper fabric will snag and fray. For the lucky few who can afford one, a Chanel jacket is a decent financial investment, with high resale prices that reflect how good these jackets look even after years of wear – and the fact that those who own one will probably be minded to keep it for ever. The real thing is the dream. But the good news is that even if yours is the kind where the “Chanel” is silent, it is still a fashion classic. Hair and make up: Sophie Higginson using itcosmetics.

5/13/2022,"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and we have three young children. Before we got married, we talked about having kids and both agreed we wanted three. However, when I got pregnant with our first, my husband didn’t seem to care. He showed me no consideration when I felt unwell during the pregnancy, and when our first baby was born he barely interacted with her, sleeping in a different room so as not to be bothered by her at night, and refusing to take her out in the pram during the day so I could rest. He came home from work late and insisted on a significant amount of alone time at weekends. Getting him to do a nappy change was a huge fight. It was as if he thought our daughter was nothing to do with him. He’s a much better dad to her now that she can talk, read and play, but we had two further children and each time it was the same – I was left to do everything. I got angry and expressed my disappointment, but nothing changed. At times I even considered a divorce, but couldn’t bring myself to go through with it. Our youngest is now one so we’re finally moving out of the baby stage – and at least I know from experience that my husband’s behaviour will improve as they get older. But I am furious and feel incredibly let down at being abandoned throughout my pregnancies and the early years. The resentment is eating away at me and is now affecting our entire relationship. What do you suggest I do to let go of these feelings? I’m sorry this happened to you. The early stages of being a mother can be quite isolating. After my first child was born, I remember longing to be part of a culture where a new mum does nothing for several weeks and is looked after by others while she “just” looks after her baby. It sounds incredibly tough what you went through and I’m not surprised you feel resentful, and scarred. Having children can stretch a relationship to breaking point, because (something I learned doing this column) both parents bring the way they were parented into the mix, which can throw up some painful, and often buried, emotions. In your longer letter, you mention your partner’s father did nothing when he and his siblings were young – and while I agree that this is no excuse, I do wonder what your respective expectations were and how much this was discussed beforehand. I consulted psychotherapist Paul Salvage (psychotherapy.org.uk) who echoed how hard this must have been, not least having three children in quick succession without the support you craved. Disappointments come from expectations not met. If your needs are not met it’s very hard to constantly meet those of others, especially young babies. It’s no wonder you’re angry and disappointed. Salvage and I also talked about how first-time mothers can have ambivalent feelings about the baby, and how this is perfectly natural. But if you’re not allowed to have those feelings (because you literally feel as if you’re the only one caring for the baby) that can be overwhelming. “If you have to be the idealised mother then all you can do is repress those angry feelings and eventually you have to project them out somehow,” says Salvage. “If resentment gets in [to a relationship] and it’s not resolved it can rot the relationship.” I would concur that resentment is not a seed you want to grow. We could both hypothesise about what was going on for your husband, and how that might change how you feel. And it’s good news that as the children get older he seems more able to relate to them and is becoming the sort of father you hoped he would be. But when resentment has got this deep, you really need professional help to unpick it. You said you didn’t want to be a single mother, but a partnered mother with deep lodged anger and bitterness is no picnic either. Salvage suggests you “process some of this anger but that doesn’t mean letting him off the hook”. Couples therapy would be perfect for both of you, and if he won’t go then you can go on your own to help you start this.

5/13/2022,"Having said last week that I never seem to have enough whites in my wine rack, I now realise that I rarely have enough of the reds I want to drink, either. You, too? Maybe the kids are sneakily “borrowing” bottles when your back is turned, but it’s more about the season, I think, and the switch from winter to spring and early summer. At this time of year, I want my reds light, bright and breezy – in other words, from a recent vintage and largely unoaked and the kind of wine I could happily drink without food. (I know many people are perfectly happy to drink a 14.5% malbec on its own, but I’m not among them, or at least not at the moment.) It’s a style of wine referred to in France as a vin de soif or glouglou, or a thirst-quencher. The English equivalent of gluggability or smashability is the nearest we get to it, but that somehow suggests excess, rather than drinkability. (That said, one of the wines in today’s pick, the Saint-Pourçain that surprisingly classifies as a Loire wine – the Loire is incredibly long – has the words “Raaa Grande Soif! Patron, une autre!” on the label.) In fact, France still does this style better than anyone else, so long as you exclude pinot noir from elsewhere. Beaujolais is the obvious example, though the cru (village) wines can be serious, along with the cabernet franc-based Loire reds. The Anjou is a particular favourite in this week’s lineup, and only 12.5%; in a similar vein, I’d also look for bardolino, frappato and valpolicella from Italy and bobal and mencia from Spain. So called new-world wines from the southern hemisphere are traditionally riper and higher in alcohol than that, but the younger generation of winemakers, particularly those who have embraced the natural wine movement, are tending to pick earlier and prioritise lightness and freshness. Look out for grape varieties such as cinsault and pais (from Chile; North Americans call the latter “mission”) and, again, gamay, the grape from which beaujolais is made. Young syrah can be quite sprightly, too. Finally for this week, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, because not all restaurants seem to get the message: it is perfectly acceptable to drink this style of wine chilled. Maybe not ice-cold as you might a bottle of fizz, but give it a good half-hour in the fridge. Cool, in other words, which is exactly what you want at this time of year. Estevez Chilean Pinot Noir 2020 £3.99 Aldi (in store only), 13%. Bright, juicy, raspberry fruit. Astonishingly good for the price. Anjou Rouge L’Ardoise, Domaine des Rochelles 2020 £9.25 The Wine Society, 12.5%. I love a Loire cabernet franc, and this joyously fruity example is the region at its best. Drink with grilled asparagus. Saint-Pourçain Le Ficelle Rouge 2021 £12.75 Yapp Brothers, 12%. If ever there was a vin de soif, this is it. All it needs is a baguette and some saucisson.

5/13/2022,"There are battles. There are libel battles. And then there is … Wagnarok. Yesterday afternoon, several hours into her cross-examination in the high court, Rebekah Vardy returned from an emotional break in proceedings to observe from the witness box: “It’s been a very long few days.” Yeah, well. Chat shit get banged. It was Rebekah’s husband, Jamie Vardy, who first uttered that deathless adage, back in 2011 when he was playing non-league football, though weirdly he wasn’t actually making a heavily ironic comment on Britain’s libel laws. Spool forward to the present day, though, and we have to ask: which shit-chatter is getting banged in the high court? Is it defendant Coleen Rooney, against whom Rebekah chose – actually chose! – to bring this action, with Vardy’s pretrial legal costs alone estimated at £1m? Or is the shit-chatter in fact the sender of messages including “[I] would love to leak those stories”, and “I want paying for this”? Or, to put it much more iconically, is the shit-chatter … Rebekah Vardy’s account? Whatever happens during both Coleen’s cross-examination and the final judgment, the sheer volume of Vardy’s dirty laundry that has been aired this week suggests the gavel has already come down in the court of public opinion. I have yet to see a non-sarcastic #TeamVardy hashtag out there in the wild. This trial is now by far the worst thing Rebekah has ever bought (including the yellow latex dress for the 2018 TV Choice Awards). Admittedly, proceedings have added several hilarious entries to the annals of quotable quotes. The court heard how Vardy declared in 2019: “Arguing with Coleen is like arguing with a pigeon. You can tell it that you are right and it is wrong, but it’s still going to shit in your hair.” So at one end of London’s Strand we have Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square, and at the other end we have Rebekah Vardy in the high court. Both are covered in pigeon shit: who wore it better? Speaking of outfits, Coleen turned out for day two of the trial in a £32.99 Zara dress, arguably nailing the “mum-of-four-who-literally-hasn’t-got-time-for-this-bollocks” look. Rebekah, meanwhile, was in something vastly more expensive, having seemingly fallen for a stylist spiel along the lines of, “I’m thinking Jackie O, with top notes of Amal Clooney.” It must be said that Rebekah has not been fantastically advised by a number of people around her in recent times, from anyone who failed to discourage her from issuing proceedings, to the agent and close friend who somehow dropped the phone she had been ordered to retain into the North Sea during a boating excursion. You know, the North Sea. Classic Wag holiday destination. This detail – merely one aspect of the Vardy team’s full-spectrum data loss – yielded another quote of the trial, with Rooney’s barrister, David Sherborne, observing deliberately obscurely that the phone “is now in Davy Jones’s locker”. Rebekah to the judge: “I’m sorry, I don’t know who Davy Jones is.” Oof. That horrendous-whitey moment when you think some guy called Davy Jones has somehow recovered the handset and cached it. Fortunately, perhaps, the phone remains somewhere beneath the waves, and is easily the most valuable North Sea resource since Brent crude. So where did it all go wrong? If she leaked those stories, Rebekah’s key social miscalculation was to fail to realise that ever since Coleen was thrust into the limelight as an innocent schoolgirl – and promptly derided as Queen of the Chavs, and voted Britain’s Worst-Dressed Woman of 2004 by some snooty tabloid – she has always prized loyalty above almost anything else. And, as you might expect from a proud Liverpool girl, she is not particularly crazy about the Sun. Anyone who cares to read the things Coleen has said down the decades would be left in absolutely no doubt as to her intense loyalty to family and friends, most of whom she goes back to childhood with. She likes fashion, yes – but she likes her mates and her family immeasurably more (total mensch, if we’re honest). All this is the background to her now-legendary detective investigation – an attempt to prove that Vardy had betrayed a code that profoundly mattered. And there WAS a sisterly code among the Wags, back in the peak era of the 2006 World Cup. Contrary to the way a lot of the papers portrayed it, there wasn’t catfighting and one-upmanship among the wives and girlfriends of the England team back in those era-defining Baden-Baden days. As Coleen noted furiously soon after: “It makes a better story to say there were divisions in the camp.” The Wags were monstered back then, of course, in another preposterous outbreak of tabloid snootiness. And the unwitting irony inherent in much of their monstering of Rebekah this week is that she is exactly what the papers want: the sort of person who will flog them unpleasant stories. If only there were literally decades of evidence that that would turn out to be a devil’s bargain. As for the lessons to be drawn from this epic rubberneckers’ ball … if memory serves, I’ve written before about the wisdom or otherwise of talking to the press. Forgive the disloyalty to my profession, but my cast-iron advice to any friend who asks is always: don’t. The experience is utterly asymmetric. It will be an infinitely bigger deal to you than it will be to them, and more often than not turns out in unfortunate ways you didn’t predict. What I haven’t said is that this advice was really inspired by some once given to me by a very good lawyer and very good friend. And that advice was: never litigate. Never, never litigate, unless it is absolutely unavoidable. Unless we’re talking about some serious crime, which is obviously different, then just don’t go to court. Do anything to avoid it. It is totally consuming, and it weighs on you in a way it never could for all the lawyers making money off it (and off you). In the months and even years you wait for your case to be heard, it’ll be the first thing you think about when you wake up, and the last thing on your mind when you go to bed at night. In 99 out of 100 instances, the best advice is to leave it, and get on with living your life. Anyway, I merely pass it on. As Rebekah Vardy is perhaps now discovering, more than two and a half years after Coleen’s fabled Instagram post, very few things in this life are more horrifyingly overrated than having “your day in court”.

5/13/2022,"It’s the Dragons’ Den pitch parents have been dreaming about: an expandable children’s shoe that fits long enough to be worn out, and it could soon be a high-street reality. The average young child needs new shoes every four months, a rapid and costly replacement cycle that sees Britons buy 80m pairs a year, most of which end up in landfill. But come 2023, kids trainers that are capable of expanding by at least three half-sizes could be in stores after a footwear entrepreneur won backing from the £1m sustainability fund. Jeroo Doodhmal, the founder of eco-shoe brand Pip & Henry, is behind the “expandable” shoe, a product she thinks could reduce the scale of waste in the UK footwear market where 85% of shoes end up in landfill, according to the Better Shoes Foundation. “Our aim is to create a shoe that can expand by at least three half-sizes, and therefore double the lifetime use of any shoe,” she said. The design is aimed at under-sevens, a period when children’s feet are growing rapidly. The 38-year-old businesswoman got the idea after the birth of her daughter. “On the one hand I was showing her Blue Planet, and trying to get her inspired by nature, but on the other, she was outgrowing clothing and footwear faster than I could effectively recycle it,” she said. The hard part to get right will be the sole, and several options are being explored. One is a mechanism that can be extended and secured with an interlocking piece, like a jigsaw. Another is to use a flexible material that can be stretched and then locked into position. The upper will be made out of an elasticated material and secured using zips and toggles. The shoes will also likely come with several insoles. The £250,000 grant will be used to complete the design of the sole and its fastenings. “I think we’re about a year away from it being in the shops,” said Doodhmal. “We have to test the prototypes and then take it to industry experts for their feedback … then come up with a final concept that’s ready for commercial launch.” To tackle the huge waste mountain generated by the footwear industry technical experts involved in the project will also investigate a design that can be dismantled, enabling the shoe to be recycled more easily at the end of its life. But the big question is can magic shoes be affordable? Other companies have experimented with sandals and insoles that alter a shoe’s width. Doodhmal thinks the answer is yes. “We won’t move the needle on that 85% statistic if we don’t take this concept to the mass market. It is my ambition to keep the cost down as much as possible,” she said. Pip & Henry shoes cost £60 but she thinks the expandable design will probably cost up to £20 more. “The funding is substantial enough to take us all the way,” she added. “I feel very confident we will be able to come up with something really valuable and robust.” Last year, the John Lewis Partnership, which also owns Waitrose, invited academics, charities and startups to present ideasthat could end the high street’s “throwaway” culture. Pitches with the potential to reduce the environmental impact of the food, clothing and gadgets we buy would receive a share of the money raised from the sale of 10p plastic bags in stores. The Circular Future Fund received 245 entries with the four winners required to share their learnings, and how their ideas can be scaled. The Scottish Library and Information Council is getting cash to pilot “lend and mend spaces” in libraries so people can share tools, equipment and expertise to repair and reuse household objects. The other winners were the Polyester Infinity project at the University of Leeds, which is researching how to remove dye from polyester to make the fabric easier to recycle, and period brand Dame. Dune will use its cash to fund starter kits and an online advice service for women trying to switch from traditional products. Marija Rompani, John Lewis’s director of ethics and sustainability, said the projects had the potential to create “real impact”. “Our throwaway culture, and the waste it generates, are unquestionably among the biggest challenges we will face in our lifetime and tackling them will require a different kind of thinking.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Expandable shoes for children aim to cut landfill waste,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/13/expandable-childrens-shoes-landfill-waste-eco-sustainability-fund
5/13/2022,"Corgis and horses are out; tattoos and shades are in. Portraits of the Queen by 52 contemporary artists to mark her platinum jubilee depict the monarch in ways rarely seen since the days of the Sex Pistols. Among the works are Queen of the Hood, by ballpoint artist James Mylne, which shows a “majestic and stunning” young Elizabeth in regal Order of the Garter robes accessorised with designer sunglasses. Mylne said: “A key aspect of what I do is mix classical ideals with urban styles. For this piece I took it a bit further, representing her in a way that fits in with a more modern, fashionable and cool culture.” Another, by Louisa Tebbutt, shows the “never complain, never explain” monarch with a strip of union flag across her mouth. James Vaulkhard made an image out of 2p coins, while Ernesto Romano has created an X-ray profile of the Queen. Romano said: “The depiction aims to convey the message of how her cultural influence during 70 years of reign can travel beyond borders, race, gender and social status, encompassing universal values of equality and diversity.” Will Teather’s Queen sports a tattoo of a serpent dripping blood below the words “Skate and destroy”. Elena Cecchinato created 200 queens in a project called Multividuality which include a queen of angels, queen of lovers, queen of fathers, and queen of dreamers. “Working with an iconic figure such as Elizabeth II made me reflect on how multitude and singularity are inevitably part of the same narrative for every human being,” said Cecchinato. “All humans – despite their privileges – have to deal with the same life’s rituals of passage and emotions: birth, death, love, disappointment or sadness.” A 2016 image by the musician and graffiti artist Goldie of the young monarch against a union flag is included in an exhibition, Art Save the Queen, that opens at gallery@oxo on London’s South Bank in June. Images will also be displayed on London Underground poster sites at Victoria Station, and digital versions of the artworks will be released. Dylan Roberts, who curated the exhibition for its organisers, the Ad Lib gallery, said the works covered a wide range of styles, including oil paintings, mixed media, collage and street art. “HM Queen Elizabeth is a true icon and inspiration to people everywhere. We have been overwhelmed by the work the artistic community is submitting, underlining what a cultural inspiration the Queen is.” The Sex Pistols’ anti-royalist punk record God Save the Queen, released at the time of the monarch’s silver jubilee, is being reissued to mark her platinum jubilee.",News/UK news,‘Cultural inspiration’: contemporary artists mark Queen’s jubilee,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/13/cultural-inspiration-contemporary-artists-mark-queen-jubilee
