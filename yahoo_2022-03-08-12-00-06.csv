3/8/2022,"By Carlos Barria and Mehmet Emin Caliskan KYIV, March 6 (Reuters) - Ukrainian soldiers bolstered defences around Kyiv on Sunday, digging trenches, blocking roads and liaising with civil defence units as Russian forces bombarded the surrounding areas and attacked towns and villages nearby. While the armed forces and civilian volunteers dug in, thousands of people continued to try to flee the city of 3.4 million as fears of a full assault spread. Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and has concentrated its heaviest attacks on the south and east of the country, besieging cities including Mariupol and Kharkiv with artillery fire and air strikes and causing extensive damage and casualties. Kyiv has been spared the worst of the fighting so far, but intense battles have raged in surrounding towns and villages and Russia's defence ministry released footage on Sunday of some of its tracked military vehicles on the move near the capital. Video provided by Ukraine's armed forces taken on Saturday in the Kyiv region, showed Ukrainian efforts to defend the capital, with piles of sandbags and concrete slabs laid across a main road, while Ukrainian soldiers carefully checked passing cars. A smaller road was blocked by metal ""hedgehog"" anti-tank barriers, and machine gun positions had been erected. Molotov cocktails were lined up on the side of the road, as civilians vowed to join the battle to protect Kyiv. ""We are equipped 100%,"" said an unidentified soldier in the footage. ""Positions are prepared, we've fitted them out and we are simply waiting to meet them here ... Victory will be ours."" Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. In Irpin, a town some 25 kilometres (16 miles) northwest of Kyiv, men, women and children trying to escape armed clashes in the area were forced to take cover when missiles struck nearby, according to Reuters witnesses. Soldiers and fellow residents helped the elderly hurry to a bus filled with frightened people, some cowering as they waited to be driven to safety. MASS EXODUS The fighting has driven more than 1.5 million people to leave Ukraine for neighbouring countries in the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said on Sunday. Millions more displaced internally are heading for the relative safety of western Ukraine. Men of a fighting age have been ordered to stay, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called on his people to do what they can to repel the Russians. Kateryna Laskari, a production company executive, left her home city Kyiv soon after the invasion began. She reached a small village 50 km (31 miles) away where her family has a house, and has stayed there with her three-year-old son, Simon, her pregnant sister, who is due to give birth in two weeks and their parents. ""To tell the truth, and it feels like 10 years,"" she told Reuters via Zoom of the first 10 days of the war. ""Of course, I'm frightened as is everybody, but I have so many people I'm responsible for. I'm responsible for my family, I'm responsible for my business,"" she added. ""But to tell the truth, I thought I would be even more frightened. Now I feel like a soldier. I feel that I have a lot of energy to just to fight, because I know that we will win.""

3/8/2022,"Efforts to push the Biden administration into supporting the transfer of Russian-made fighter jets to Ukraine appear doomed for both technical and geopolitical reasons. Why it matters: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pleaded for the jets on Saturday during a Zoom call with more than 300 members of Congress, saying they were badly needed if NATO wouldn't establish a ""no-fly"" zone. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free Those jets would likely be Soviet-era MiG-29s possessed by Poland, which Ukrainian pilots are capable of operating. The U.S. would, in turn, backfill Poland's fleet with American-made F-16s. Reality check: White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated Monday the U.S. would be in ""no way opposed"" to Poland's ""sovereign decision"" to transfer its planes but stressed there are a number of logistical hurdles. Those include how the planes would actually enter Ukraine's heavily contested airspace, as well as how to accelerate the years-long U.S. procurement process for ""serious weapon systems"" like the F-16. The Russians have also been bombing Ukraine's airports, raising the specter of the planes having to be based in Poland or other NATO territory — increasing the risk of a Russian attack on soil that would have to be defended by the alliance. Between the lines: Zelensky's appeal produced an immediate and bipartisan groundswell of support. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) sent a letter on Monday calling on the Biden administration to ""do everything we can to compensate countries that heed Ukraine’s desperate call for fighter jets to defend their homeland."" His Republican counterpart, Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), tweeted: ""There is absolutely no reason we can’t supply airplanes to Zelensky and the Ukrainians. Our allies are willing and able to provide them, the admin needs to get out of the way."" Between the lines: Top Russian military expert Michael Kofman says it's a mistake to ""waste time"" on the MiG debate, arguing there are other supplies and weapons systems that would be more helpful to Ukraine. ""Frankly, a lot of the aircraft Ukraine has put up has gotten shot down,"" Kofman said. ""And pushing MiG-29s — are they really going to fly from air bases that are being readily barraged on a daily and nightly basis?"" Zoom out: There's also the matter of whether Poland itself is willing to risk provoking Russia, though the calculus in Warsaw could change if it received rock-solid security guarantees from the U.S. Calling a Wall Street Journal report about the potential MiG-F16 deal ""FAKE NEWS"" on Sunday, the office of the Polish prime minister tweeted: ""Poland won't send its fighter jets to Ukraine as well as allow to use its airports. We significantly help in many other areas."" A government spokesman clarified to a public broadcaster on Monday: ""It is a very delicate matter. The Polish authorities have not made any decisions on the transfer of the planes to Ukraine."" The big picture: The risk of being deemed a ""co-combatant"" by Russia continues to permeate every U.S. and NATO decision about weapons transfers and intelligence sharing. Russia's defense ministry warned Sunday that if foreign-supplied jets are used to attack the Russian military, it could be considered ""the involvement of these states in an armed conflict.""

3/8/2022,"STORY: In a move to further punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, the United States is considering a ban on Russian oil imports without the participation of allies in Europe, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters Monday. The White House is said to be negotiating with U.S. congressional leaders who are working on fast-tracking legislation, though White House press secretary Jen Psaki said there's no decision yet. “No decision has been made at this point by the president about a ban on import, a ban importing oil from Russia. And those discussions are ongoing internally and also with our counterparts and partners in Europe and around the world.” President Joe Biden Monday tried to press his case in a video conference call with the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom. But Germany, the biggest buyer of Russian crude oil, has so far rejected pressure for a ban. The United States, which has imposed a host of painful sanctions against the Russian economy, Vladimir Putin, and many Russian billionaires since the invasion began, has stopped short of targeting Russia's oil and gas, worried it could drive energy prices even higher. Oil prices have soared to levels not seen since 2008, and Americans are getting sticker shock at the pump – but some don’t mind if it means condemning Russia. TIM JOYCE: ""As far as I'm concerned, we should raise the gas prices, I mean, stop importing oil from Russia and put the hurt on them. It’s going to make inflation go up even higher, but we’ve got to do what we’ve got to do.” Meanwhile, Axios reported that President Biden might make a trip to Saudi Arabia, as the United States seeks to get Riyadh to increase energy production. A White House official didn't deny the report, but said it was “premature speculation"" and that nothing was planned yet.",Politics/Reuters Videos,U.S. may act alone on Russian oil ban,https://news.yahoo.com/u-may-act-alone-russian-014707786.html

3/8/2022,"A Russian oligarch told the captain of his yacht to sail from France to Turkey ASAP, per the WSJ. Igor Sechin's yacht was docked in France when he was sanctioned after Russia invaded Ukraine. French authorities tied the yacht down so it couldn't leave, a customs officer told The Journal. Igor Sechin, a Russian billionaire and oligarch, told the captain of his now-seized superyacht to leave a French port and sail to Turkey as fast as possible after he was hit with sanctions, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. The US and the European Union put Sechin, who is said to be a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on their sanctions lists shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Sechin is also known as Russia's ""Darth Vader."" The report on Sechin's orders offers a glimpse into how the wealthiest Russians who were targeted by sanctions sought to move their yachts and private jets across the world after the invasion of Ukraine in order to protect their assets. Eric Salles, a lead officer on the seizure operation, said in an interview with The Journal that French customs officers found out last week that the yacht was preparing to leave the French town of La Ciotat despite having repair work scheduled. Customs officers also heard the yacht was owned by Sechin, CEO of Russian state-controlled oil giant Rosneft, Salles added. The customs officers went to the yacht and questioned the captain, Salles said in the interview. The captain told officers that he had orders to leave the French port and ""sail to Turkey as quickly as possible,"" Salles told The Journal. After hearing this information, French authorities tied the yacht to the quay with steel-rope slings so it couldn't leave, Salles told The Journal. Officers proceeded to check documents, further question the captain and crew, and surveil the vessel 24/7, Salles added. Sechin's yacht was officially seized by the authorities on Wednesday night, according to a press release tweeted by French finance minister Bruno Le Maire. The yacht's captain — still on board the vessel with other crew members — wasn't arrested, Salles told The Journal. Sechin is among several high-profile Russian business executives who have been sanctioned by the EU, US, UK, and others because of their ties to Putin. Gennady Timchenko, a Putin confidant, and Alexei Mordashov, reportedly the wealthiest man in Russia, had their superyachts seized by officials in Italy, The Associated Press reported on Friday.

Though Russians launched a targeted offensive, Ukraine has not buckled and continues to fight back despite lack of weaponry, he said. Victory will ""definitely be achieved."" Ukrainians in the country's southern region have particularly held down the fort and created a ""nightmare"" for Russian forces, Zelensky added. ""They forgot that we are not afraid of paddy wagons and batons. We are not afraid of tanks and machine guns. When the main thing is on our side, truth. As it is now."" Negotiations have so far remained unsuccessful, but the president said that ""we will insist on negotiations until we find a way to tell our people: This is how we will come to peace. Exactly to peace."" The big picture: Ukraine is on its 12th day of siege under Russian forces, with heavy shelling increasing across the nation. Russian attacks in the first week alone killed more than 2,000 civilians, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service. Despite pleas from Zelensky, Western leaders have so far refused to commit to a no-fly zone. More than 1.7 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, making the exodus the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World World II, according to the UN.

3/8/2022,"SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — News reports from Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities under unrelenting bombardment by the Russian military have been triggering painful memories among the survivors of the 1990s siege of Bosnian capital Sarajevo. And yet, many have been spending hours on end glued to their television screens since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. “Not so long ago, we were them,” said Amra Muftic who survived the 1992-95 siege, watching news reports showing civilians taking refuge from Russian rocket attacks, shelling and gunfire in basements and subway stations. “If our experience is anything to go by — and I have a gut feeling that it is — things are about to get much worse” for them, she added. Bosnian Serb forces laid siege to Sarajevo in the early 1990s, during the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia. About 350,000 people were trapped, for 46 months, in their multiethnic city, subjected to daily shelling and sniper attacks and cut off from regular access to electricity, food, water, medicine and the outside world. More than 11,000 people were killed during the siege, including over 1,000 children. Countless others were wounded. “We know how they feel. We survived the longest siege in modern history” said Elma Vukotic, an anesthesiologist, as she and her fellow health care workers stood earlier this week outside their Sarajevo hospital, clad in their medical robes and holding balloons in the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag — and, coincidentally, also the Bosnian one. Vukotic said their spontaneous show of solidarity was the least they could do for their Ukrainian colleagues. “All wars are painful, all attacks against civilians abhorrent, but what is happening to Ukrainians right now is especially traumatic for us, because they are so near and in a situation very similar to ours” three decades ago, Vukotic said. “Television images of pregnant women waiting to give birth in the basement of the Kyiv hospital, hastily converted into an emergency bomb shelter, gave me a strong sense of deja vu; I know exactly how they feel, how terrified they must be,” she added. “Also, I think we all can empathize with how unwilling ordinary Ukrainians were to accept that the war was coming until Russian rockets and bombs started raining down on their homes, schools and hospitals.” The Bosnian war started when Bosnian Serbs, with the help of the Yugoslav army, tried to create ethnically pure territories with the aim of joining neighboring Serbia. More than 100,000 people were killed and 2 million — more than half the country’s population — were left homeless during the conflict. The Serb leadership argued throughout the war that multiethnic Bosnia wasn't a country at all and that, along with its Catholic Croats and its Bosniaks, who are mostly Muslim and account for about half of the population, it should be split between neighboring Serbia and Croatia. Bosniaks, they insisted, were just treacherous Serb converts who centuries ago abandoned their original (Orthodox Christian) faith. Many in Sarajevo heard the echoes of those old insults in Putin’s recent statements, offered to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A U.N. arms embargo maintained in Bosnia throughout the 1990s conflict gave Bosnian Serb militias, armed and backed by the Serbia-controlled Yugoslav Army, an edge in the fight. They conquered 60% of Bosnia’s territory in less than two months, committing horrendous atrocities against their Bosniak and Croat compatriots. In 1995, the U.S.-brokered Dayton Peace agreement put an end to the bloodshed in Bosnia by dividing the country into two semi-autonomous parts — one run by the Serbs and the other shared by Bosniaks and Croats. The two are linked by weak multiethnic institutions. But living together in the aftermath of a brutal, fratricidal conflict has proven to be difficult. The postwar power-sharing system perpetuates the polarized and venomous political climate in Bosnia, while its entrenched nationalist leaders continuously stoke ethnic animosities for political gain. With Moscow’s backing, the strongly pro-Russia Bosnian Serbs, in particular, have been advocating for years for the independence of their region. Meanwhile, sectarian networks of patronage and pervasive corruption, which gradually became integral to the system, ensure that Bosnia remains one of the poorest countries in Europe, increasingly losing its best and brightest to other countries. “Right now, Ukrainians are subjected to torture, they are pleading for help and hoping for who knows what,” said Zoka Catic, a filmmaker and journalist from Sarajevo who has spent years documenting the devastating impact of war on the mental health of Bosnians of all ethnicities. No matter how the conflict in Ukraine ends, he argued, there is no such thing as a happy ending to a war. “It is just a matter of time … before (Ukrainians) turn into us: sad, unhappy people who experienced the worst feeling in the world — helplessness.” ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"Watching Ukraine, Bosnians relive the trauma of their war",https://news.yahoo.com/watching-ukraine-bosnians-relive-trauma-071918041.html
