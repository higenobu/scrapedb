4/7/2022,"The world, we are told, is in a state of chaotic and unprecedented flux. Technology is changing our lives at a frightening rate. All across the globe, societies are fracturing and falling apart. The destruction of the planet is accelerating before our eyes. Every passing week seems to bring new ruptures, new shocks, new disfigurements. But Luka Modric is still running the midfield for Real Madrid, so, you know, that. And not just Modric: as white shirts insouciantly knocked the ball around the Stamford Bridge lawn in the closing minutes, it was like peering through a telescope into a perfectly preserved phantasm of the past. Toni Kroos had already gone off, but Casemiro was still there, snapping and scurrying like a man looking for a lost wedding ring. So was Dani Carvajal. So was Nacho Fernández. Even Gareth Bale had treated us to a rare foray from the bench, boosting his daily step count if little else. And then, of course, there was Karim Benzema: jersey still moist from the rain, features still etched with a pure, restless desire. Carlo Ancelotti finally took him off in the 86th minute, but the Madrid fans were still singing his name half an hour later. Benzema came over to greet them, and while his teammates disappeared down the tunnel Benzema lingered a little longer, savouring the moment, perhaps hoping to eke it out forever. The gilded lineage, the familiar faces and rhythms, the comfort of continuity: this is the gift of Madrid, but also its curse. After all, they arrived in London with points to prove. It is a very Madrid sickness to be 12 points clear in La Liga and still basically grumbling about everything, but since the turn of the year – and certainly in recent weeks – not all has been well. Against Barcelona in the Clásico, they looked limp and leaden, a team that had run out of ideas and puff. Modric and Kroos were overrun in midfield. Madrid lost 4-0. And when you look at this squad, what strikes you above all is the encrusted decadence, the sense of extravagant waste. Their bench here was full of players you forgot existed: Mariano, Bale, Dani Ceballos. Isco is still there. Eden Hazard and Luka Jovic are still there. Marcelo is still there. Madrid don’t need Kylian Mbappé. They need an HR department. By rights, then, Ancelotti’s side should be in a kind of spiralling decline, the sort of slow crisis that takes a decade to fix. But of course, they’re not. Part of the reason is that their footballers are still extremely good. Modric was brilliant here: teasing and controlling and manoeuvring the midfield despite looking increasingly like a 70-year-old Jimmy Bullard. Again, Modric shouldn’t really be doing this. He’s a month older than Wayne Rooney. Jorginho cleaned him out after his very first touch. Antonio Rüdiger ran past him as if he wasn’t there. And briefly it felt as if Chelsea, with their superior fitness, their superior organisation, their Premier League speed and intensity, might just run Madrid off the park. And yes, Real’s midfield is not quite as nimble as it used to be. They rarely push into the final third. They do not show for the ball from Thibaut Courtois. And so their utility is strictly delineated. If a centre-half gets into trouble, or the front three have messed up the press, Modric and Kroos are not coming to save you. But as Madrid came into the game, probing the spaces behind Chelsea’s wing-backs, we were reminded that speed is not simply a physical attribute. It was Kroos who played the forward pass that led to Benzema’s opening goal: a symphony of perfectly-pitched high-grade attacking talent, the sort of goal Paris Saint-Germain still occasionally score when they’re not scowling at each other. Next it was Modric to turn provider, another headed miracle from the brass neck of Benzema. By which point, of course, there was no longer any doubt as to the identity of tonight’s star attraction. Consider: Benzema spent the prime years of his career as a sort of human sacrifice, running the channels and occupying defenders so Cristiano Ronaldo could be the man. He watched his country win a World Cup on television because of a six-year international exile. At 34, with 16 years of top-class football in his legs, it would be entirely reasonable for him to be winding down his career, perhaps with a well-paid sinecure in China or the United States, and thereafter a comfortable life of cryptocurrency partnerships and Uefa draws. And yet all along there was an impatience to him, a fire that never went out, an urge to sharpen the edges of his game, push his limits. Édouard Mendy will be blamed for Madrid’s third goal but we should acknowledge the pure hunger from Benzema to hunt down a lost cause, the same hunger that took him from the banlieues chaudes of Lyon to the pinnacle of the game, to never stop chasing, to never stop dreaming. None of which obscures the very real and pressing questions Madrid face over the next six to 18 months. This squad does need renewal. It does need a vision. Ultimately it probably needs a new coach. A valid criticism of Madrid is its continued reliance on these ageing stars, a refusal to accept that things change and nothing lasts forever. But on nights like this, you realise why it remains such a seductive fantasy.",Sport/Football,Real Madrid and Karim Benzema offer the comfort of continuity | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/06/real-madrid-and-karim-benzema-offer-the-comfort-of-continuity

4/7/2022,"Britain’s employers are being forced to shoulder a £9bn tax rise after the government pushed ahead with raising national insurance on Wednesday despite stiff opposition. Company bosses said the 1.25-percentage-point rise in national insurance contributions (NICs), which is paid by workers and their employers, would add to already severe pressure from runaway inflation and soaring business costs this year linked to Covid, Brexit and Russia’s war in Ukraine. “[The] national insurance rise piles another cost pressure on top of firms at a time when they can ill afford to bear it,” said Shevaun Haviland, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. “Members are telling us that energy bills are soaring while the price of raw materials are reaching levels many have never encountered before. This comes alongside vastly increased shipping costs and a squeezed labour market.” According to Treasury figures released in response to a parliamentary question from Labour, the portion paid by employers is to raise £8.8bn for the exchequer in the current financial year. The brunt of the rise will be borne by key sectors including manufacturing, which is facing extra taxes worth £900m. Employers in the health and social care sector will be taxed £1bn extra, while those in the wholesale and retail trade will face a similar increase and the construction industry will be landed with a bill worth £400m. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, said the figures showed the government was not on the side of employers. “The Conservatives’ decision to hike taxes during a cost of living crisis will make things even harder for businesses and families,” he said. Reynolds said Labour would instead have launched a one-off windfall tax on profits made by oil and gas producers amid the surge in energy prices, which would be used to help small firms with tax cuts and support for energy intensive industries such as ceramics. With inflation at the highest rate since at least the early 1990s, the government has faced heavy criticism from across the political spectrum for pushing ahead with the manifesto-busting NICs rise Designed to raise billions of pounds to fund health and social care, the move has prompted questions about the timing, amid Britain’s worsening cost of living crisis, with critics arguing that other options could have been pursued to raise the money. Defending the plan on Wednesday, Boris Johnson said he had “absolutely no problem” with the increase because it was “unquestionably the right thing for our country” as the health service faced growing demand and grappled with a backlog built up during the pandemic. However, employers groups said it would inflict pain for businesses struggling to recover from the Covid shock to the economy. Martin McTague, the national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said it was a “jobs tax hike” that would hurt workers and employers. “The small business tax burden is now at its greatest since the 1950s – a development which couldn’t have come at a worse time, with spiralling energy costs, input cost inflation, supply chain disruption and Covid-related staff absence all taking their toll,” he said. Research from the manufacturers’ trade group Make UK shows as many as 60% of industrial firms believe the rise will have a moderate or significant impact on their recruitment plans, while almost three-quarters say it will add to inflationary pressures that will be passed on to consumers. “The NICs increase is just one of many significant costs facing UK manufacturers and there will be a big question as to whether the UK is a competitive place to do business right now,” a spokesperson for the group said. The Treasury said it was supporting workers and businesses with rising costs, including a tax cut worth £1,000 for half a million small firms by increasing the employment allowance – a tax break on wage bills – starting from Wednesday. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, used his spring statement last month to offset some of the impact of rising inflation, including an increase in the threshold at which workers begin to pay national insurance from £9,880 to £12,570 that comes into effect from July. On top of a package of energy support including a council tax rebate and loan scheme announced in February, Sunak announced a 5p cut to fuel duty rates, a £500m increase in a household support fund and pledged a 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax in two years’ time. However, only £1 in every £3 of the measures announced by the chancellor will go to the poorest half of people in Britain, according to the Resolution Foundation. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates the national insurance rise will rake in about £17.2bn in total for the exchequer from workers and employers, far more than the £6.3bn cut for workers benefiting from the threshold change. A government spokesperson said it was supporting employers and workers. “No government can control the global factors pushing up prices, but we will act where we can to support businesses,” they added.",News/Politics,National insurance rise forces UK employers to shoulder £9bn tax burden,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/06/national-insurance-rise-uk-employers-tax
4/7/2022,"Government industrial strategies are often derided as attempts to pick winners. The UK’s Conservative government has taken a different approach with its new energy strategy. In terms of dealing with the energy bill and climate crises, it’s picking losers. It is crystal clear that transforming the energy efficiency of the nation’s draughty homes should be the No 1 priority. After all, the cheapest, cleanest energy is the energy you no longer use and nothing can be installed faster than insulation. There are huge opportunities – for example, just 40% of UK homes have sufficient loft insulation. But there is nothing new in the strategy beyond an advice website. Former Tory energy minister Charles Hendry calls this a “major misjudgment” that will “force large numbers of very vulnerable people to be cold next winter when they need not be”. The next priority should be renewable electricity, now six times cheaper than that from gas-fired power stations. There are 649 wind and solar projects that already have planning permission. These would save more gas than the UK imports from Russia. But the strategy promises nothing to cut the planning regulations that David Cameron used to strangle onshore wind development and large-scale solar farms. The vast majority of people, including Tory voters, back more wind power in their areas, polling consistently shows. But your future energy bills now will be even higher than they need to be because ministers are worried a tiny minority of people can’t cope with looking at turbines. There is a boost to offshore wind, a genuine British success story, but it is unavoidably more expensive than onshore wind. The “big bet” Boris Johnson has chosen to take is on nuclear power. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said this week that “there is a world where we have six or seven sites in the UK” by 2050. That world is never-never land. Nuclear power is the only major energy technology that has increased in cost in the last decade and routinely suffers from massive time and budget overruns. Even Kwarteng acknowledges that France’s large nuclear fleet “cost a fortune”. The gamble Johnson is making, with taxpayers’ money, is that nuclear power is a more reliable wager to secure clean future power than renewables and fast-developing energy storage technologies. It’s a long shot. Renewables and storage will develop much faster and get much cheaper due to the rapid learning that comes with small-scale technologies, unlike colossal projects like nuclear. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) report on Monday, produced by scientists from across the globe and signed off by 195 governments, mentions renewables, wind, solar and efficiency 67 times in its summary. It cites nuclear once (in brackets), as an example of a technology with high upfront costs. The UK energy strategy also backs more drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea – which flies in the face of its own net-zero climate targets. Furthermore, the dwindling reserves that remain cannot lower the price of commodities, which is set by a global market. Don’t just take that from me; Kwarteng, energy minister Greg Hands and COP26 president Alok Sharma all agree. On Monday, after the IPCC report, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said: “The truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness.” That is the UK he is now talking about. The only good news is that shale gas has been sidelined, with a review of safety a sop to the small group of noisy frackheads on the Tory back benches. Another of Johnson’s “big bets” is on hydrogen, apparently in the hope that it can be used to heat a third of UK homes as an alternative to fossil gas by 2050. That is folly, not least as heat pumps will be much cheaper and less polluting. Using fossil fuels could produce lots of hydrogen, but also cement our dependence on oil and gas, while belching out CO2. Green hydrogen – produced from renewables – will be very expensive for years, and the limited supply should be reserved for sectors that are really hard to decarbonise. Why has the government got this so wrong? It’s partly short-term politics. An “ally” of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is reported to have defended the refusal to fund more energy efficiency by saying: “We have to be scrutinising every extra penny of taxpayer money that is proposed for spending because ultimately we want to do the Conservative thing and cut taxes for people.” That is, just before the next election. It is also partly the adherence to the dogma that the only solution to problems is “our treasured free-market economy”, as Kwarteng described it on Tuesday. That is despite the warning in 2011 from the government’s own climate adviser that “leaving [energy efficiency] to the market has never worked anywhere in the world”. He was right. The first of two big failed efficiency schemes saw loft insulations plunge by 93%. Most depressingly, the energy strategy’s failings seem also partly due to Johnson’s penchant for big, shiny projects, rather than the hard graft of thousands of smaller ones. But the six or seven nuclear power plants he dreams of are likely to follow the same fate as his island airport, garden bridge, and tunnel to Northern Ireland. Helen Clarkson, at the business-focused Climate Group, said: “We have tools and technologies already available which can radically reduce our energy needs and our carbon emissions now. Energy efficiency measures can deliver immediately in cutting people’s fuel bills and get us on the path to net zero in the longer term. There’s a huge opportunity for a win-win here which the government is passing up.”",News/Environment,‘Major misjudgment’: how the Tories got their energy strategy so wrong,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/06/major-misjudgement-how-the-tories-got-their-energy-strategy-so-wrong
4/7/2022,"Boris Johnson is to put nuclear energy at the heart of the UK’s new energy strategy, but ministers have refused to set targets for onshore wind and vowed to continue the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas. Amid deep divisions among senior Conservatives, the strategy will enrage environmentalists, who say the government’s plans are in defiance of its own net-zero targets and neglect alternative measures that experts say would provide much quicker relief from high energy bills. The prime minister will launch the plan on Thursday, after a period of intense political wrangling set against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has convulsed energy markets and sent home energy bills rocketing. Whitehall sources said rows over the strategy between No 10, the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) continued right up until the eve of publication, with an insider describing the process as “chaos”. The cabinet eventually agreed that atomic energy would form the backbone of the strategy, and up to eight new reactors are planned. Targets for onshore wind and solar power generation will also be raised, in a push for 95% of Great Britain’s electricity to come from domestic renewable energy sources by 2030. But the plans risk infuriating environmental campaigners, after the opportunity to remove barriers to more onshore wind farms appeared to fall victim to Tory in-fighting, new North Sea drilling won the government’s blessing, and ministers appeared to open the door to fracking. Opposition parties were scathing about the strategy. Two formerenergy secretaries from Labour and the Liberal Democrats branded it “ludicrous” and “hopeless” for failing to expand onshore wind power or tackle energy efficiency. Ed Miliband, the Labour climate change secretary, said the energy relaunch was “in disarray” and would do nothing to help the millions of families facing an energy crisis now. “Boris Johnson has completely caved to his own backbenchers and now, ludicrously, his own energy strategy has failed on the sprint we needed on onshore wind and solar – the cheapest, cleanest forms of homegrown power,” he said. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader and another former energy secretary, added: “The Conservatives’ failure to help people cut their bills with an urgent energy insulation programme, the failure to back super-cheap onshore wind and the failure to back properly new technologies like tidal power and hydrogen is a total betrayal of families and pensioners across the UK.” The energy strategy outlines a wide-ranging plan to boost domestic energy production through a range of power sources. They include: Increasing nuclear capacity from 7 gigawatts to 24GW Offshore wind target raised from 40GW to 50GW (from 11GW today) Solar could grow five times from 14GW to 70GW by 2035 An “impartial” review into whether fracking is safe Up to 10GW of hydrogen power by 2030 Johnson said the plan will “reduce our dependence on power sources exposed to volatile international prices we cannot control, so we can enjoy greater energy self-sufficiency with cheaper bills”. “This plan comes in light of rising global energy prices, provoked by surging demand after the pandemic as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This will be central to weaning Britain off expensive fossil fuels, which are subject to volatile gas prices set by international markets we are unable to control, and boosting our diverse sources of homegrown energy for greater energy security in the long term.” While some renewable domestic energy sources won backing, the wind industry’s hopes of getting the green light to double onshore capacity to 30GW appeared to have fallen victim to opposition from within the Conservative party to new projects, particularly in England. Communities who live near planned new projects could be offered incentives, such as guaranteed lower energy bills, but the plan does not include targets for increased generation. Cabinet colleagues have been at odds over whether to reform planning laws to spur faster development of onshore windfarms, which can take as little as a year to build and start contributing to the grid, but were described by transport secretary Grant Shapps as an “eyesore” at the weekend. Shapps and chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris, a longstanding opponent of onshore wind, are among a group of MPs who have sought to thwart a major rollout in England, with Michael Gove and business minister Kwasi Kwarteng – whose brief includes energy – among those to have pushed back. The business department is also understood to have been thwarted by the Treasury in a plan to channel £300m of budget underspend into a rapid rollout of energy efficiency upgrades that could aid homeowners in bringing down their bills. Solar won significant backing from the government, which said planning rules could be relaxed to favour development on non-protected land, enabling capacity to increase up to fivefold, from 14GW to 70GW. The target for hydrogen power will be doubled to 10GW by 2030 “subject to affordability and value for money”. Overall, “clean” energy sources could provide up to 40,000 new jobs, reaching a total of 480,000 by 2030, the government will say. But alongside the push for renewables sit plans that will alarm opponents of further oil and gas exploitation. The British Geological Survey will conduct an “impartial” review of whether fracking for shale gas can proceed safely, a move likely to spark fury among environmental campaigners about the controversial technology, particularly after a moratorium was imposed on the process in 2019. New North Sea oil and gas projects are also likely to be accelerated, although the strategy sets out proposals to limit emissions as much as possible. Nuclear power forms the centrepiece of the energy strategy. Ministers expect to begin a competitive selection process as early as next year for a new round of nuclear projects, although tensions between Downing Street and the Treasury over the cost of new projects, which are expected to require government investment, have yet to be resolved. The target of producing 25% of Britain’s electricity from atomic energy is likely to require tens of billions of pounds of new investment from private companies, with the state providing guarantees under a new “regulated asset base” funding model. A £120m “Future Nuclear Enabling Fund” will be launched this month in the hope of kickstarting projects, while a new body called Great British Nuclear will oversee the plans. National Grid has predicted that peak electricity demand will hit 85GW by 2050, up from 60GW today, because of factors such as the electrification of vehicles and home heating. The government said it could approve up to eight new reactors to help reach a target of generating 24GW of the total from nuclear power plants, which typically have more than one reactor. Some of the increase can be achieved by extending the life of the Sizewell B reactor, while the Hinkley Point C project is due for completion in 2027 and Rolls-Royce has the government’s blessing for small reactors nicknamed “mini-nukes”. Major projects that have already been through some form of planning, such as Sizewell C and Wylfa, on Anglesey, have been singled out by the government as among the first to win support. The target also implies new plants at sites whose locations have already been approved but where no plans are under way, such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire or Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria. While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted global discussion on how to reduce reliance on Kremlin-controlled oil and gas, it appears to have cooled the government’s resolve to limit the UK’s own fossil fuel production. Drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea is at odds with the government’s own net-zero targets. The government will justify the plans by saying that local exploitation of hydrocarbons emits less carbon than importing supplies from elsewhere. Ministers have also commissioned a new study to examine safety concerns about fracking, which polls have shown is deeply unpopular with the public.",News/Environment,PM to put nuclear power at heart of UK’s energy strategy,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/06/pm-to-put-nuclear-power-at-heart-of-uks-energy-strategy
4/7/2022,"On a Sunday afternoon in August 2021, the Lyft driver Isabella Lewis was shot in the head by a passenger she had just picked up and left for dead as the man sped off in what appeared to be a fatal carjacking. Lyft released a statement to the press at the time saying it was “heartbroken by this incident” – but Allyssa Lewis, Isabella’s sister, said her family had never received direct communication from the company, nor any financial compensation. Instead, in the days following the killing, Lyft sent an insurance representative to Isabella’s abandoned, bullet-riddled vehicle before the family could collect her remaining belongings, Allyssa said. “There is nothing that could bring my sister back, but it would have meant a lot just being able to get Lyft to acknowledge that she died while working for them,” Allyssa said. Isabella was one of at least 50 US gig workers killed on the job since 2017, a new study from the advocacy organization Gig Workers Rising reports. The group found dozens of workers for firms such as Lyft, Uber and Postmates have been fatally assaulted on the job – including six in the first two months of 2022. The report charges the companies don’t do enough to mitigate “an urgent safety crisis”, or help victims’ families following assaults. “This is a systemic and sickening practice in which these corporations – which do not do enough to protect their workers – try to protect their bottom line by offloading risk on to them,” said Cherri Murphy, a co-author of the report. Victims were identified through publicly available resources including news reports, police documents, legal filings and GoFundMe fundraising campaigns, the organization said. Most gig firms do not publicly share data on the number of deaths, meaning the figures were likely to be “much greater” than what was listed in the report, it added. Of the more than 50 workers killed on the job, 63% were workers of color, the study found, though they comprise less than 39% of the overall US workforce. While most gig economy firms do not release diversity figures for their workforces, independent surveys indicate more than 78% of gig workers are people of color. Other studies echo those findings: a recent Pew Research Center report showed gig workers of color are more likely than those who are white to say they have at least sometimes felt unsafe or been sexually harassed on the job. Murphy herself used to drive for Lyft and completed more than 12,000 rides before she became disillusioned with the lack of support from the company and financial instability of the job. She said in most cases, families of workers receive no compensation for deaths that occur while working on the apps. Such was the case for Allyssa, who said the grief she felt about her sister’s death was compounded by Lyft’s response. “To have someone working for your company to give her life while on the job, and her family cannot even get a pat on the back, or any personal outreach,” Allyssa said. “It makes it feel like she didn’t matter to them.” A Lyft spokesperson, Gabriela Condarco-Quesada, said the company was “committed to doing everything we can to help protect drivers from crime” and had invested in safety technology, policies and partnerships. “Since day one, we’ve built safety into every part of the Lyft experience,” she said. Lyft has a partnership with the security company ADT that allows drivers to connect with professionals if they feel unsafe. Lyft also proactively monitors rides and reaches out to drivers if it notices irregularities to connect them with emergency services. Condarco-Quesada said Lyft had attempted to contact Isabella Lewis’s family on the day it learned of the incident to offer support. “Unfortunately, we were unable to make contact with them,” she said. But Veena Dubal, a labor law professor at the University of California, Hastings, said responses like the one the Lewis family received were endemic to the business model of gig economy companies, which have for years battled to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees entitled to compensation. “These companies do not follow best practice principles because those would make them look like an actual employer,” she said. Dubal noted that while traditional driving jobs like driving taxis had always come with risk, such dangers were exacerbated by the algorithms and expectations of ride-hailing apps. “These platforms are designed to punish drivers for not picking up passengers,” she said. “This means you are constantly worried about ratings and are incentivized not to trust your gut feeling if it is telling you to end or cancel a ride.” Gig firms have in the past acknowledged the issue of violent attacks on their workers. Uber moved to keep drivers safer in 2016 after 16 drivers had been killed in Brazil. But workers and officials have called on companies to do more. Gig Workers Rising set out a number of demands, including calling for workers’ compensation for injuries and deaths that occur on the job and the right of workers to unionize. The group called for the end of forced arbitration, which requires workers to settle these matters out of court and away from public scrutiny. Such demands have grown in popularity as politicians increasingly take gig economy firms to task. It also called on companies to increase transparency about how many injuries and deaths occur yearly. Condarco-Quesada, the Lyft spokesperson, said the company released data in its yearly Community Safety Report, which includes data about fatalities that occur on the platform. Uber, which owns Postmates, releases a similar report but did not immediately respond to request for comment. “Every worker deserves to feel safe in their workplace,” said the congresswoman Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts in a statement. “We must stand with workers and demand that these corporations take responsibility and pay a living wage, provide good benefits, and, crucially, guarantee workplace protections that effectively and equitably shield workers from violence.” In response to the study’s publishing on Wednesday, workers in five US cities are holding a national day of action for those lost on the job, including sending a motor caravan to the San Francisco home of the Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. “The lack of care for these workers is a direct outcome of a business model set up to milk as much as possible for executives,” said Murphy. “No one when they show up to work should be killed.”",News/Business,At least 50 US gig workers murdered or killed since 2017 – study,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/06/gig-work-lyft-uber-postmates-deaths-danger-study
