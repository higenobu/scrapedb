3/7/2022,"Volodymr Zelenskiy has vowed to punish “every bastard’” who committed atrocities during the invasion of Ukraine amid outrage at Russia’s shelling of civilians as they tried to flee a town on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing a young family. The president of Ukraine said in a video address on Sunday night: “They were just trying to get out of town. To escape. The whole family. How many such families have died in Ukraine. We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war.” To the Russian forces behind the attack, in the town of Irpin on the western edge of the capital, Zelenskiy said: “There will be no quiet place on this earth for you. Except for the grave.” Hundreds of civilians had gathered near the bridge at Irpin on Sunday, seeking to escape the capital, with only a dozen Ukrainian soldiers there, mostly helping them with their luggage, according to the New York Times, whose team were filming at the time of the shelling. The mortar fire from the Russians began some distance away from the bridge, before coming nearer to the street where the civilians were caught out in the open, the Times reported. Eight died in the attack, including a woman, her teenage son and a primary school-age daughter, plus a family friend. Their belongings lay scattered around the street. In footage of the attack a group of fighters could be seen trying to help the family. The mayor of Irpin described seeing the four killed “in front of my eyes” when a shell hit them. “It is impudence, they are monsters. Irpin is at war, Irpin has not surrendered,” Oleksandr Markushyn said on Telegram, adding that part of the city was in Russian hands. Markushyn said another evacuation effort would begin on Monday morning. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered the fasting-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war, according to the head of the UN’s refugee agency. Vast numbers of Ukrainian civilians continue to flee cities under bombardment, including the besieged coastal city of Mariupol where Russian forces agreed again to allow a second urgent evacuation that ended in a fresh bombing. “It’s murder, deliberate murder,” Zelensky said in his address as he warned of more shelling to come on Monday. It had been hoped that 200,000 of the 430,000 residents in Mariupol – where medicines and food are running short and people are living in freezing conditions with no heating – would be able to escape during an agreed nine-hour ceasefire on Sunday, but only a few hundred people are believed to have made it out before shelling resumed. The International Committee of the Red Cross implored the two sides to renegotiate, saying there were “devastating scenes of human suffering in Mariupol”. A third round of Russian-Ukrainian talks aimed at finding a way out of the bloody conflict is set for Monday. During a tense call with Putin in which Macron had also emphasised the need to avoid disaster at Ukraine’s nuclear power sites after the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant by Russian forces last week, France’s president reiterated the west’s demand that civilians be given safe passage. “The [humanitarian] situation is difficult” in Mariupol, a French official said. “Our demands remain the same: we want Russia to respond to these demands … very quickly and clearly.” Very few refugees from the strategic city on the Azov Sea made it out on Saturday, but one family, who did not give their names, arrived in the central city of Dnipro and recounted their harrowing experience. “We stayed in the basement for seven days with no heating, electricity or internet and ran out of food and water,” one of them said. “On the road, we saw there were bodies everywhere, Russians and Ukrainians … We saw that people had been buried in their basements.” The Kremlin said Putin had pinned the blame for the failure of the ceasefire to hold in Mariupol and neighbouring Volnovakha on “Ukrainian nationalists”. Putin “drew attention to the fact that Kyiv still does not fulfil agreements reached on this acute humanitarian issue”, the Kremlin said. “And the pause in hostilities was again used only to build up forces and means in their positions.” Rejecting Moscow’s denials, US secretary of state Antony Blinken told CNN: “We’ve seen very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians, which would constitute a war crime.”",News/World news,Ukraine’s Zelenskiy vows revenge on Russian forces after fleeing family killed in shelling of Irpin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/ukraine-volodymr-zelenskiy-vows-revenge-russia-forces-fleeing-family-civilians-killed-shelling-irpin-town
3/7/2022,"After nearly two years of dodging Covid-19, one of the most remote inhabited places in the world has recorded its first ever cases of the virus. Rēkohu, or the Chatham Islands, are just over 800 kilometres east of New Zealand’s mainland and are home to roughly 600 permanent residents. The Canterbury district health board (DHB) confirmed two of its residents had tested positive for the virus over the weekend and were now isolating and being supported. The streets of the largest settlement, Waitangi, were quiet on Monday, with very few people around, Chatham Islands mayor Monique Croon said. “Some people are really worried, and for others, they are prepared and quite comfortable.” “It’s certainly not the best of news but we have prepared for this.” Croon could not give further detail about the cases, only that one person who tested positive had been off the islands. New Zealand has recorded a rapid rise in cases since the Omicron variant arrived in the country in January. It reported 17,522 cases on Monday with 696 people in hospital. Like other island territories and nations that have evaded the pandemic, including Nauru, Pitcairn Islands and Tokelau, the Chatham Islands have benefited from an ocean border, but unlike those nations which have also gained from strict border controls, the Chatham Islands are part of New Zealand, and residents and mainlanders are free to come and go. Croon said the community had considered the possibility of creating its own border protection, but that the council had made it clear it wanted to follow New Zealand’s national directives for the pandemic response. “That has been really effective for the island.” The community has been vigilant in following pandemic policies since the beginning, including hand washing, contact tracing, lockdowns and social distancing, Croon said, despite not having had a case up until this point. The islands are prepared for the possibility of widespread transmission, with iwi (tribes), council, and health officials meeting every week to plan for an outbreak, she said. “The introduction of rapid antigen testing is really key to getting quick early detection, and it’s going to be available to everybody in the community. We also know who is vulnerable in the community, and if some of our vulnerable people get infected, they will probably be flown off island.” The health board’s Dr Helen Skinner said the DHB would be distributing rapid antigen tests to all households on the islands this week, and the islands’ health centre would be offering vaccinations. Just 56% of the community has been boosted, compared to the national average of 73%. “We encourage anyone who isn’t vaccinated or hasn’t had their booster to get vaccinated as soon as possible,” Skinner said.",News/World news,"Chatham Islands, one of world’s most remote places, records first Covid cases",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/chatham-islands-one-of-worlds-most-remote-places-records-first-covid-cases
