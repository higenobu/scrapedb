5/20/2022,"The Morrison government has been hit by an election-eve leak that cabinet’s national security committee blocked a proposal by the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, to double Australia’s support to the Pacific. Labor said the “extraordinary” pre-election leak, first reported by the Australian newspaper, showed the government was “falling apart”, while Scott Morrison insisted the committee was “extremely tight”. The revelation was expected to trigger renewed debate about the government’s Pacific policy in the wake of China signing a security deal with Solomon Islands. Guardian Australia has confirmed that the proposal advanced by Payne included an approximate doubling of Australia’s total financial support to Pacific island countries over four years. This package included foreign aid but the measures proposed to the national security committee are believed to have been broader. The proposal was partly driven by concerns that if Australia did not ramp up support to its friends and neighbours in the Pacific, the gap would be filled by others, including China. The policy, which was described internally as the next stage of the government’s Pacific step-up program, was being developed late last year and discussions continued into early 2022. It is understood the national security committee did not adopt the entire package although some elements were salvaged. For example, the budget handed down in March by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, included $350m in temporary and targeted support to assist the Pacific with Covid-19 recovery. The national security committee, chaired by Morrison, is responsible for decisions on major issues of strategic significance and its deliberations are usually tightly held. Its deputy chair is Barnaby Joyce and the other members are Frydenberg, Payne, Peter Dutton, Simon Birmingham, Karen Andrews and Michaelia Cash. When a reporter asked Morrison on Friday why members of his government were leaking against him, Morrison said he rejected that accusation “100%”. The prime minister defended his ministerial colleagues. “My national security committee has been extremely tight,” he said. Morrison said such meetings were “not just attended by ministers” but were “also attended by officials” – but he stopped short of saying he would launch a leak investigation. While declining to confirm or deny the substance of the report, he pushed back at the idea that increasing funding would thwart China’s activities in the region. “You’re suggesting if you double funding in the Pacific, somehow the Chinese government doesn’t have any influence or won’t be seeking to coerce or exert its influence,” Morrison told reporters in Perth. “That assumption doesn’t hold.” Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, said the pre-election leak was “extraordinary”. “What this shows again is Mr Morrison dropping the ball,” Wong told ABC Radio National. “They simply did not ensure that they looked at how Australia could make sure we were the partner of choice. “How do we ensure that we secure our region? That’s the key strategic question. And on this Mr Morrison dropped the ball, and Australian security is paying the price.” Birmingham did not deny the substance of the story in the Australian. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “There’s no shortage of willingness from our government to invest,” the finance minister told ABC Radio National on Friday. “I’m just emphasising we have absolutely acted on much advice from Marise and we have increased support in the Pacific.” Birmingham said he would not enter into a public “debate” about the story, and Payne was “not going to debate what does or does not go to cabinet either”. Morrison has repeatedly argued that the government was not blindsided by the emergence of security negotiations between China and Solomon Islands, which led to the signing of a deal in the early stages of the Australian election campaign. After the signing, Morrison said Australia and the US shared the same “red line” when it came to opposing a Chinese military base in Solomon Islands, without specifying what action might be triggered if that line were crossed. Morrison has argued China is exerting “enormous pressure” on Pacific island countries, and has dismissed claims from Labor that the deal represents the biggest Australian foreign policy failure in the Pacific since the second world war. On Thursday he said he wanted to visit Solomon Islands and other Pacific island countries if re-elected on Saturday. Labor’s costings, released on Thursday, included a pledge to add $538m to Australia’s foreign aid budget for the Pacific over the next four years. The Labor policy is part of a broader package of measures aiming to “restore Australia’s place as first partner of choice for our Pacific family”. Dutton has repeatedly argued that China has taken an “aggressive” approach and operates “by very different rules” in seeking to deepen its influence in the region. Some of the rhetoric has angered the prime minister of Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, who said the country was being treated like kindergarten children. In April the head of the Office of National Intelligence, Andrew Shearer, denied that there had been an Australian intelligence failure, insisting that China had long been interested in expanding its presence across the Indo-Pacific. New Zealand’s foreign affairs minister, Nanaia Mahuta, later characterised it as “a relationship failure” in an interview with the Guardian. On Friday the Australian government said total support to the Pacific was $2.7bn this financial year. That figure included loans, security programs, health and financial support and “a record $1.85bn in official development assistance”. “We are easily the largest bilateral donor to the Pacific,” a government spokesperson said, pointing to the opening of six new diplomatic missions in the Pacific since 2018 and the doubling of the lending capacity of the Australian infrastructure financing facility for the Pacific, from $1.5bn to $3bn.",News/Australia news,"Cabinet committee blocked plan to double Australia’s support to Pacific, election-eve leak reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/cabinet-committee-blocked-plan-to-double-australias-support-to-pacific-election-eve-leak-reveals
5/20/2022,"With the polls tightening in the final days of the election campaign, both major parties are preparing for a tight contest on Saturday. Labor, after carrying the scars of the 2019 loss which it was widely expected to win, is being more cautious about predicting wins from the Liberal party this time round. But Labor is desperately hoping the widespread anti-Morrison sentiment is enough to deliver it government under a “safe change” strategy that has seen the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, adopt a small-target approach and run a low-key campaign. The magic number for majority government is 76 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives. Labor holds a notional 69 seats, so needs a net gain of seven seats for a majority government, but could form minority government if it wins just five. The Coalition holds only 75 seats after the defection of the United Australia party leader, Craig Kelly, to the crossbench, so also needs to win seats to maintain its majority. The Coalition has thrown the kitchen sink at trying to shore up its position, and believes there remains a narrow path to victory if it can win seats off the Labor party. Everything will need to go right for the Coalition for it to remain in government, and it is hoping that undecided voters will choose to stick with the devil they know when they vote on Saturday. Only one thing is for certain – this election will throw up new quirks and trends that are not yet known, as we emerge from a once-in-a-century pandemic that has seen voters across Australia live very different experiences. So what are the possible scenarios – and seats – that may determine the victor on election night? If the swing is on and voters decide it’s time to boot the Morrison government, then Labor will expect to pick up seats in every state. The seats most likely to fall to Labor in this scenario are Pearce and Swan in Western Australia, Boothby in South Australia, Chisholm and Higgins in Victoria, Reid, Robertson and possibly Bennelong in New South Wales, Bass and Braddon in Tasmania, and Brisbane, Longman and Leichhardt in Queensland. Winning these 13 seats, which would give Labor a comfortable majority of 82, is an optimistic scenario, and both sides say it is unlikely all of these Coalition-held seats will fall. For comparison, it is worth noting that in the 2007 “Ruddslide” election, Labor secured 83 of the House of Representatives’ 150 seats after being comfortably ahead in the polls against John Howard in the run up to polling day. Labor’s primary vote in the election-eve Newspoll in 2007 was 46%, compared to 41% for the Coalition. Ahead of this election, Labor’s primary vote in the Guardian Essential poll is at 35% compared to 36% for the Coalition, making the result much more difficult to predict. A more realistic scenario is that Labor wins some – but not all – of these Coalition-held seats, and is able to win the seven seats needed to govern in its own right. While a narrow Labor majority government is the most likely outcome based on current polling numbers, it is by no means guaranteed. If Labor can hang on to all of its seats, but can only secure five of the above-mentioned seats, it can be confident of forming minority government. The five seats the Labor party is most confident about winning are Pearce, Swan, Boothby, Chisholm and Reid. If it can get across the line in these five key marginals, then it would have a total of 74 seats – two short of the magic number. In this scenario, Labor would be confident of securing support from the Greens MP Adam Bandt and Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie to deliver minority government. While Albanese has ruled out doing any deals with the Greens, Bandt has released his seven key demands for backing a Labor government. Winning five seats and not losing any of those it already holds is the worst Labor can do and still be confident of forming government. If the Coalition can sandbag seats and limit its losses, and pick up seats from Labor elsewhere, then there remains a small chance that the Liberals and Nationals can remain in majority government. Let’s say Labor wins the five seats above – Pearce, Swan, Boothby, Chisholm and Reid – then the Coalition’s numbers have been reduced to 70, compared to Labor’s 74. But the Coalition has been aggressively targeting the Labor-held marginal seats of Gilmore, Corangamite, McEwen, Hunter, Parramatta, Lyons and Lingiari, with a notable focus on outer-suburban and regional areas. It is also expected to win back the seat of Hughes from Kelly. For each of these Labor seats that the Coalition can win – if any – the opposition would need to find another Coalition-held seat further up the pendulum to ensure it could form government. If Labor wins all five of its most likely target seats, but the Coalition can win five of these seven target seats from Labor, the Coalition retains its 76-seat majority (assuming it wins back Hughes). This would be an extraordinary result for the Coalition and while it is a more unlikely scenario it is certainly a possibility. Any combination of the above could also see the Coalition maintain its majority – providing it offsets any losses with the same number of gains elsewhere. This scenario could be helped by the allocation of United Australia and One Nation preferences, which in some marginal seats are being directed to the Coalition. It’s worth noting, though, that minor party preferences only have a limited impact on the result given voters don’t always follow how to vote recommendations, and will only matter in tight contests. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says he is aiming for a majority government, but this is an unlikely scenario given the pressure the Coalition faces both in marginal seats and so-called teal seats. If Labor falls short of a net gain of five seats, then the Coalition could potentially form a minority government. If Labor wins four seats, it would have more seats than the Coalition on 73, compared to 72 for the Liberals and Nationals (providing the Liberals win back Hughes, but nothing else). While Labor would be confident of winning over Bandt and Wilkie, it is possible that the remaining four MPs on the crossbench could back in the Coalition. Rebekha Sharkie, the MP for the seat of Mayo, has indicated that she would be more likely to back the Coalition in the event of a hung parliament, while Zali Steggall has suggested she would be more likely to support the Liberal party if Morrison was dumped. Bob Katter and Helen Haines have not declared who they would back in the event of a hung parliament, but given they both come from traditionally conservative electorates, they are seen as more likely to back the Coalition. Of course, this scenario is based on the crossbench of the 46th parliament staying the same after the election. Given there are many seats where other independents are seen as a strong chance of success, the crossbench could well look different after Saturday’s poll. There are at least five “teal” independents who are a strong chance of winning seats from the Liberal party, and none of these have indicated who they would support in the event of a hung parliament. The Greens could also pick up another seat from either Labor or the Liberal party, as could regional independents targeting Liberal and National MPs. The more independents elected in place of Liberal MPs, the more difficult it will be for the Coalition to remain in government – either minority or majority – regardless of the traditional political alignment of the seat. If the election is tight, then it is possible we will not know the result on Saturday. The Australian Electoral Commission does not start counting postal votes until Sunday morning, and at this election more than 2.5 million people have requested postal votes from the AEC so far. In the event of a hung parliament, the result may not be known for many days – or even weeks as negotiations with independents take place. In 2010, it took 17 days before crossbench MPs decided to support Julia Gillard as prime minister. Traditionally, the winner waits until receiving a concession call from their opponent before declaring victory on election night. Both Albanese and Morrison will have their phones at the ready.",News/Australia news,Who will win?

5/20/2022,"For the veteran political correspondent Laura Tingle, elections are “stupid and depressing”, and this one has been no different. What with Anthony Albanese “basically just going around and kissing babies” and Scott Morrison avoiding all the places where “voters hate him so much”, it’s been a “strange campaign”, the ABC stalwart told Malcolm Farr on the Judith Neilson Institute’s election podcast. She said press conferences may seem “shouty and aggressive” but the travelling circus was doing its best under difficult circumstances. But on Thursday, Tingle wasn’t so charitable. The 7.30 chief political correspondent lost her patience as the media repeatedly tried to catch Albanese out over his election costings. She called the display “embarrassing” and, once, again the behaviour of the press came under the spotlight. Sorry. But this is embarrassing for my profession pic.twitter.com/Ud7lUo8pxP Tingle also took a swipe at Morrison for avoiding scrutiny during the campaign, including turning down an invitation to address the National Press Club and an ABC debate. “If politicians don’t want to speak to the ABC, that’s fine,” she said. “That’s really fine. But they think that they’re somehow punishing the ABC journalists for that. Whereas my view is they are actually accountable.” It wasn’t only the ABC that was largely ignored by the prime minister, SBS’s Indigenous broadcaster, NITV, was dismissed by Morrison when he was confronted about why no one from the Coalition had accepted an invitation to appear on The Point’s election special. When the SBS political correspondent Shuba Krishnan asked him why no one would appear he continued walking towards his car and said: “We’re investing $30m in connectivity … that’s how you close the gap.” SBS Political Correspondent @ShubaSKrishnan tried to get the Prime Minister on why no one from the Coalition was available for NITV while campaigning in Lingiari (the seat with the highest percentage of Aboriginal voters in the country)Here is the response. 👇🏽 👇🏽👇🏽 pic.twitter.com/B1PCjWu7GE When Labor’s Linda Burney and the Greens’ Lidia Thorpe joined John Paul Janke and Narelda Jacobs for a discussion about key Indigenous issues, there was an empty chair for the Coalition. We asked the prime minister’s office why no one was made available to talk to NITV but it ignored us too. One feature of the campaign has been the Australian’s Sharri Markson’s highly critical pieces on candidates who she says have not been supportive enough of Israel. Anthony Albanese was a vigorous critic of Israel, Markson wrote this week. His position was there in “black and white, for all to see” – and “it’s not pretty”, she said on Sky News. For the record, Albanese has condemned the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and reaffirmed Labor’s strong support of Israel. Earlier in the campaign Markson revealed that the independent candidate for Goldstein, Zoe Daniel, had signed an open letter last year which referred to Israel as an “apartheid regime” and accused it of launching a “brutal war against the besieged population of Gaza”. Daniel is now on the record saying “the word, ‘Apartheid’, should not be used to describe the situation in Israel” and proclaiming herself “a strong supporter of Israel as a Jewish State, existing within safe and secure borders”. Markson also highlighted in another article that the climate activist Blair Palese, who was linked to the independent candidate for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, had once expressed support for the BDS movement on social media. Spender has said she strongly opposes the BDS movement and also expressed strong support for the Jewish community and Israel. In a revealing interview with the Australian Jewish News, headlined “Sharri Markson’s brilliant career”, the reporter explained her motivation for pursuing candidates over their historic attitudes towards Israel. “The sentiment in the leftwing media to attack Israel is deeply upsetting and it makes me really, really angry – absolutely furious,” she told the AJN. “I’m really worried that if the Labor party gets in in the next federal election there won’t be the same support for Israel that we have seen under the Coalition government.” Scott Morrison won significantly more mentions in the media during the six-week campaign than his opponent, tracking 47,877 mentions to Anthony Albanese’s 39,914, or 55% to 45%, according to Streem data. But it was Albanese who won the dubious prize of the most negative press, in particular in Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers and on Sky News Australia. Just one example of a personal attack came this week from Miranda Devine, who has de-camped to the New York Post but continues to write for the Daily Telegraph. At an Italian club, Albo finally found “a few people who can pronounce his Italian surname correctly”, Devine said. “Not that pronunciation is the opposition leader’s strong suit.” “After a campaign full of ‘deshishions’, ‘lejushlashun’, the ‘conomy’ and the ‘shituashun’ in ‘Straya’, it’s hard to believe Australia might have a prime minister heading to the Quad meeting in Tokyo next week with such a lazy tongue.” She went on to accuse the man who grew up in public housing of being unable to pronounce even his own name. Devine’s nasty piece was in stark contrast to the profile of Jenny Morrison produced by James Massola in the Sydney Morning Herald this week: ‘She’s just lovely’: Jenny Morrison joins Scott Morrison on the campaign trail. “Morrison regularly casts his eye around for a half-second, here and there, mentally locating Jenny; you can hear it in his voice, too, as he calls out ‘c’mon Jen’ as the touring party prepares to dash to the next event and he reaches for his wife’s hand once more,” Massola wrote. Oh, James. Really. Is that what passes for ""Analysis"" now at @smh?‘She’s just lovely’: Jenny Morrison joins Scott Morrison on the campaign trail https://t.co/l8u8B3aR1F “If Jenny Morrison could meet 50.1% of voters, Scott Morrison would be prime minister for life.” According to Streem, the major issues canvassed in the media this campaign have been the cost of living, Covid, employment, housing, budget and climate change, with the PM’s major topic the cost of living while Albanese’s was employment. After November’s debacle at the Kennedy awards when the Australian Financial Review’s Michael Roddan was ejected from the journalism prize night for labelling it the “Bogan Walkleys”, we thought the annual event couldn’t get any weirder. We were wrong. David Ross revealed in the Australian that the Kennedys have received $100,000 from two rightwing Queensland organisations, one of which is reportedly part of a group that has supported challenges to anti-vaccination mandates: the newly formed AJA and TNT Radio. They will now be known as the AJA Kennedy awards. The Australian Journalists’ Association is a new, alternative and unregistered, professional association started by the Red Union, which also formed the Nurses Professional Association of Queensland. The AJA is also the name of the original union for journalists formed in 1912. The name was dropped when it amalgamated with the union for performers to form the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance in 1992. The MEAA, which has sought legal advice over the use of the name and the logo, has accused the Kennedy awards of doing themselves “a disservice” by associating with the new AJA. “MEAA has become aware of another organisation purporting to be a union for journalists in Australia,” the union said after the sponsorship was revealed. “This organisation is not a federally registered union and does not represent journalists. Their operations appear clouded in secrecy. The only evidence of activity seems to indicate some sort of political agenda around opposition to vaccines.” A hub director of the AJA parent group reportedly rejected suggestions by the ACTU that it was a “fake union”, saying: “Whatever. Who cares? Australian journalists, most of whom are smart, will judge us by what we do.” With the networks not rushing to broadcast Clive Palmer’s campaign launch, the United Australia party founder was forced to buy primetime airtime on networks 10 and Seven as well as an afternoon slot on Nine. Palmer has of course already spent millions buying advertising across newspapers, billboards, digital media and TV. pic.twitter.com/bpJaytC0Pe Viewers who happened to land on Channel 10 on Wednesday might have been surprised by the hour-long advertisement for the Palmer party, filmed at his Coolum resort in April. “The following program has been produced and paid for by the United Australia party. Authorised by Clive Palmer for the United Australia party, Brisbane,” they were told. The Paramount Australia and New Zealand boss, Beverley McGarvey, said in a note to staff: “An election campaign doesn’t happen without the ads. If you’re like us you would be sick of seeing them right now, which means our revenue ad sales team have done a sensational job. Well done.” As far as ratings go, The Party Policy Launch was a flop, with 58,000 metro viewers tuning in and 230,000 switching off from 10’s lead-in program. Palmer’s jet has also came in handy for the billionaire who, unlike Morrison and Albanese, doesn’t have the company of the travelling press as he goes about his campaign. The mining billionaire took three journalists along for the ride when he was campaigning in central Queensland this week: Charlie Peel from the Australian, Zach Hope from the Brisbane Times and Tim Arvier from Channel Nine. Guardian Australia and the ABC did not get the invitation. Palmer may have regretted the jaunt, however, as Hope captured the event with style, documenting that Palmer had two lunches and forgot the name of one of the UAP’s local candidates, Tanya Wieden, whom he mistakenly called Tracey. Peel reported that “about 100 party members met Mr Palmer at rallies in Cairns and Gladstone on Tuesday morning”.",News/Media,Laura Tingle laments ‘stupid and depressing’ election campaign as Morrison dodges ABC debate | Weekly Beast,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/20/laura-tingle-laments-stupid-and-depressing-election-campaign-as-morrison-dodges-abc-debate
5/20/2022,"On Thursday finance minister Grant Robertson laid out the fifth budget of his career – and easily his most conservative. It was a remarkable reversal for a politician who, only two years ago, was staring down the early months of a devastating pandemic, releasing billions of dollars in economic stimulus. That stimulus was responsible for securing a record low unemployment rate, achieving a record run of economic growth and – if Robertson’s worst critics are correct – record growth in inflation. And that was the background to Thursday’s announcement. Inflation is running a little shy of 7% and forecasters warn that relief is unlikely in the short term. Petrol prices are over $3 a litre in most centres, food prices only go one way (up) and interest rate rises are certain to occur over the short to medium term, increasing the cost of servicing a mortgage. In a different year, Robertson’s response might have tracked along traditional lines. Drawing on the Labour tradition, he might have drawn down a few billion more to offer universal relief, perhaps in the form of publicly funded dental care or a publicly funded ambulance service. But in this year, as inflation reaches 9% in countries like the UK, the finance minister delivered a budget former conservative National party prime ministers Bill English and John Key might have been proud of. To those on Robertson’s left this is – at worst – heretical. At best, it’s a disappointment. But the economic conditions demand a tightrope act. If the government increases stimulus, inflation could match it, pushing prices higher than ever. If the government refuses to act, withholding support from the most vulnerable and the “squeezed middle”, it risks pushing more and more people into poverty. That’s an intolerable outcome. And so Robertson is releasing a series of targeted measures: $350 in cost-of-living relief for people earning $70,000 or less; extending the half-price subsidy for public transport for two months, and making it permanent for community service card holders; extending the hold on the fuel excise tax, perhaps helping to keep petrol prices at $3; and increasing various discretionary grants. The government is lifting the ceiling for the dental emergency grant, for example, from $300 to $1,000. Taken together, these measures could help more than 2 million New Zealanders offset the worst impacts of inflation. In fact, the cut to the fuel excise tax is helping shave 0.5% off inflation. Robertson’s critics might argue that this conservative, precisely targeted approach is unnecessary. In her budget speech the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, argued that inflation was, for the most part, imported. Supply chain disruptions and the war in Ukraine were responsible for rising prices, rather than government spending and domestic demand. That seems reasonable, and even the orthodox economists acknowledge as much. The price of petrol, for example, is almost entirely a product of the war in Ukraine. Yet its impacts are felt across the domestic economy: everything from the cost of moving freight to the cost of getting to work is increasing. That leaves the government with few policy tools to help shelter New Zealanders from rising prices. This reading of inflation leaves keen observers with one obvious question: if inflation is mostly imported, why not spend more ambitiously? Economists talk about the inflationary thief, an intruder that – when he breaks into the economy – steals the value of wages and savings. As inflation rises, the amount you can buy with your wages decreases. So too does the value of your savings. In the plainest terms, this means the poorest New Zealanders will struggle. Their money won’t go as far as it did even a year ago. With that pressing need it seems remiss, even neglectful, of the government not to increase spending to take – using the prime minister’s words – the “hard edge” off of the cost-of-living crisis. In 2020, when Robertson delivered his third budget, the country was taking its first, tentative steps out of a two-month-long lockdown. Amid that uncertainty, and amid the unprecedented financial stress many people were under, Robertson released billions into the economy to support everything from wage subsidies to rail upgrades. In his fourth budget he dramatically increased benefits helping reverse the savagery of Ruth Richardson’s “mother of all budgets” in 1991. In those budgets – 2020 and 2021 - we saw a tantalising glimpse of a possible “Red Robbo”, committed to offsetting the worst impacts of capitalism. But in 2022 we witness a return to form and a social democrat perhaps more committed to simply offsetting the worst impacts of the business cycle. That’s disillusioning for leftists. But that moderation might be enough to win back the fickle centrists departing to the National party. And in the end, this is perhaps a set piece for winning back those voters and guaranteeing a third term in 2023.

5/20/2022,"If Labor’s candidate in the south-west Sydney seat of Fowler, Kristina Keneally, is worried that being seen as a blow-in that could cost Labor one of its deep red jewels, it certainly isn’t showing. “I’m energised,” she says. “I love doing this.” She greets people as they arrive at Fairfield Leisure Centre, the largest of the pre-poll places in the electorate on Thursday. Surrounded by an army of people in Labor T-shirts handing out how-to-votes, she’s greeted warmly by voters. As the former premier, she’s well known, even if she has lived until recently outside the electorate. The presenter of Monk TV, in his saffron robes, is shooting a video for YouTube nearby. He asks if she’ll go on camera to explain to people how to fill out all the squares. Keneally happily obliges. But despite having a margin of 14% – making it safe Labor – this multicultural seat has become a fierce battleground where dirty tricks and slurs are par for the course and parts of the News Corp media empire are now propelling a narrative that Keneally could lose to deputy mayor, Dai Le, who is running as an independent. On Monday the Daily Telegraph ran an article by Sky’s Outsiders host, James Morrow who reported that Keneally’s vote was “collapsing”, triggering further stories. Morrow’s story was based on polling by Laidlaw Campaigns of 618 people in Fowler which according to Morrow, found Keneally’s primary vote was collapsing. By Tuesday, the polling had become a major story on Sky News. Despite the lack of detail about the poll questions and no disclosure about who had commissioned it, the Morrow story made news bulletins. One reporter referred to it as “polling commissioned by News Corp” in her report, but this was unable to be confirmed. Soon it was picked up by Sky’s New’s Paul Murray and Peta Credlin in their programs. “She’s a fair dinkum independent, not part of the teal tribe or anything like that,” said Credlin, who has led the charge on unmasking any past political affiliations of independents running in safe Liberal seats. Caroline Di Russo, a SkyNews.com.au contributor, wrote a first-person article online about the importance of being local. The Guardian has not seen the poll, but according to Morrow it was conducted three weeks ago and found that Keneally’s primary vote was down nearly 13 points to 42%. But when poll participants were asked further questions “about the importance of living locally and Keneally’s record as premier”, her primary vote fell further, Morrow reported. This put the independent Le in striking distance. Morrow did not reply to queries nor did the Telegraph’s editor, Ben English. Polling in individual seats is notoriously difficult because of the difficulty of getting an accurate sample reflecting the demographics of the area. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It’s also important to know who commissioned the poll and the questions asked. Andrew Laidlaw, the principal of Laidlaw Campaigns did not respond to Guardian Australia. One of Sky’s most senior reporters took a different tack. Political editor Andrew Clennell got hold of a voice mail from 2019, lodged as part of a formal complaint to the Liberal party, in which Dai Le claimed to “control” the Cabramatta branch of the Liberal party, despite being expelled from the party in 2019. After Le denied saying such things, Clennell played it on air. There is also footage of Le at a branch meeting in 2019 where a brawl erupted over memberships, along with her husband Marcus Lambert, who remains an official in the local Liberal branch. Outside the St John’s Park prepoll station, Le insisted to the Guardian that she was a genuine independent. “I was expelled in 2016 for 10 years,” she said. She denied any Liberal party support saying she had mortgaged her house to run and provide “true local representation”. Le denied any knowledge of the poll or Laidlaw Campaigns. There was clearly a wave of support for Le among the predominantly Vietnamese Australians voting at the St John’s Park prepoll. Le and her supporters were greeted warmly and many took only her how-to-vote card. Those that took Keneally’s how-to-vote were loudly reminded by Le’s offsider, the Fairfield mayor Frank Carbone: “You know she’s from the northern beaches.” A poster war has also erupted in Fowler, with Le’s campaign running posters featuring Keneally sandwiched between disgraced former Labor politicians, Eddie Obeid and Joe Tripodi, both of whom were found to have engaged in corrupt conduct by the NSW integrity body, Icac. A counterpunch poster campaign features Le standing next to Scott Morrison and querying whether she is independent. Whether Le can pull off her challenge remains to be seen. The Laidlaw poll, according to Morrow, has it going down to the wire. Keneally, however, seems relaxed. “Fowler’s just so warm and welcoming. People are excited about a change of government,” she says. “They are voting Labor. “In south-west Sydney, the unemployment rate is double the national average and the cost of housing is the same. Housing overcrowding is a major issue: there are grandparents, parents and children living in the one house, so the help-to-buy plan really matters in south-west Sydney.” Immigration is also a big issue in the heavily multicultural seat and Keneally is happy to remind voters that she’s likely to be minister for home affairs in a Labor government.",News/Australia news,Safe federal seat of Fowler turned battleground: Kristina Keneally and the mystery polling,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/safe-federal-seat-of-fowler-turned-battleground-kristina-keneally-and-the-mystery-polling
