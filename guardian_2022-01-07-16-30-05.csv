1/7/2022,"Almost all of the 12,500 beds across public and private hospitals in New South Wales will be occupied – by both Covid cases and regular patients – when pressure from the state’s Omicron outbreak peaks in late January, if worst-case scenario modelling is realised. On Friday, after NSW’s chief health officer, Kerry Chant, acknowledged that the 38,625 new cases recorded were an “underestimate” of the actual total, health authorities released fresh hospitalisation modelling, alongside the announcement of a pause on elective surgeries and new restrictions to slow the speed of Omicron.  Pressure on the state’s health system will peak in the third or fourth week of January, the modelling based on vaccination coverage, general health and outbreak data from NSW and abroad predicts, with beds in intensive care and other wards likely to be stretched. “By the middle of February we will be certainly well past the peak of this,” NSW Health deputy secretary Susan Pearce said. Under the most realistic scenario, which is based on NSW’s infection data and current parameters, 4,700 patients with Covid will be hospitalised at the peak, with 273 Covid patients in intensive care. Under the worst-case scenario, which is consistent with what has been seen in New York, 6,000 people are predicted to be hospitalised with Covid at the peak and 600 ICU beds to be occupied by Covid patients. If the best-case scenario eventuates, the modelling – which is consistent with outbreaks seen in London and the South African province of Gauteng – predicts there will be 3,158 Covid patients hospitalised at the peak, with 270 of those people in ICU. NSW’s public hospital bed capacity is about 9,500, and on Thursday, 8,000 of these beds were occupied by 1,600 patients with Covid and 6,400 people receiving treatment for other illnesses. Should demand for hospital beds exceed 9,500, the government will be able to access at least 3,000 beds in private hospitals across NSW, taking the state’s total hospital bed capacity to 12,500. Under the worst-case scenario, 6,000 people with Covid will require beds, in addition to the baseline figure of more than 6,000 people in hospital for treatment of illnesses that aren’t Covid. NSW’s ICU capacity is 1,000 beds, and on Thursday, 467 of these beds were occupied, including by 134 patients with Covid and a baseline of 333 non-Covid patients requiring intensive care. Under the worst-case scenario, whereby 600 ICU beds will be occupied by Covid patients, the state’s intensive care capacity would be hovering just under capacity. The modelling predictions are in stark contrast to the way in which the Delta outbreak placed pressure on the state’s hospital system in 2021, when Covid hospitalisations peaked at just 1,266 but ICU admissions with Covid were 244. This pressure on ICUs experienced during the Delta outbreak is comparable with the most realistic and best-case scenarios predicted for the upcoming Omicron peak, despite different overall hospitalisation figures – a prediction in line with evidence that the Omicron strain is milder. Pearce noted that the state’s ICU bed capacity had been “quite significantly” revised down from the planned surge capacity during the Delta outbreak, as authorities are conscious that the number of health staff available to care for those patients will be affected by isolation requirements. “We obviously consider very carefully our workforce,” Pearce said, encouraging registered health professionals not currently working to rejoin the workforce. “If I need to put on a uniform myself and go and work I will.” The premier, Dominic Perrottet, acknowledged that while there was already “significant pressure” on the health system, the modelling showed that “even on a worst-case scenario, we have the capacity in our health system right now”. However Danielle McMullen, the NSW president of the Australian Medical Association, said that “aside from the worst case, even in the most realistic scenario, there will be a serious strain on our health system and workers”. “These are pretty shocking predictions for people in the health system. The next six to eight weeks will be a big challenge.” McMullen believes health workers will “rise to the occasion” and cope with the peak, but warned that “it’s not going to be a fun time to work in the health system”. “At no other stage of the pandemic have we needed that volume of private hospital capacity,” she said. “We’ve mostly leaned on it for staffing and elective surgeries, but to have the level of overflow of patients even under the most realistic prediction will be unprecedented.” McMullen also cautioned that the modelling only illustrates hospital bed capacity and doesn’t show likely emergency room levels, which continue to bear the brunt of the pressure.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She also said “there’ll be a multitude of that pressure affecting general practice”, especially as health workers are also tied up administering booster shots and initial Covid vaccine doses to children. McMullen warned people in NSW to have different expectations for health care in coming months. “To reach the capacities in the model, the threshold for entering hospital will have to adjust,” she said. “Some infections, such as urinary, skin and chest infections, can be managed at home, and so for borderline cases, those people will instead have to receive care in their home.” This week, Guardian Australia has revealed the pressure that Omicron spread has placed on hospitals, including multiple claims of Covid-positive nurses being asked to work shifts in breach of health protocols and overworked staff at a regional hospital quitting.",News/Australia news,"Almost all 12,500 hospital beds in NSW could be full during Omicron peak in worst-case scenario",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/07/almost-all-12500-hospital-beds-in-nsw-could-be-full-during-omicron-peak-in-worst-case-scenario
1/7/2022,"A new trove of secret royal correspondence further highlights the inappropriateness of John Kerr’s interactions with the Queen’s private secretary in the lead-up to Gough Whitlam’s dismissal, according to historian Jenny Hocking. Almost two years ago, Hocking won a monumental legal battle to secure the release of correspondence between then governor general Kerr, and the Queen and her private secretary, Martin Charteris.  The letters showed the extent to which the palace was drawn into Kerr’s 1975 plans to remove the Labor leader from office. They also raised questions about Kerr’s actions as governor general, a role marked by its requirement for political neutrality. The letters showed he was privately railing against the Whitlam government, attacking their policy decisions, querying appointments, revealing details of confidential meetings of the executive government, and asking for advice and assurances from the monarchy about the potential use of reserve powers to dissolve government during the 1975 crisis. On Friday, the National Archives of Australia released a huge volume of additional correspondence, spanning five governor generals and 36 years, including that between Charteris and Kerr’s predecessor Paul Hasluck in 1974, the year before the dismissal. The additional documents were reclassified and released in the wake of the high court’s 2020 decision that the Kerr letters were not “personal” correspondence, a classification that exempted them from the usual 30-year public release provisions applying to commonwealth records. An early analysis of the documents by Hocking shows a remarkably different approach taken by Hasluck, a former Liberal member, in his correspondence with the crown. Hasluck wrote roughly one letter a month. His correspondence was much rarer than Kerr, who wrote constantly to Charteris, asking his advice regularly, including on mundane matters, like what he should wear to his swearing in ceremony. The difference is so stark that the Kerr letters, which span three years, are as voluminous as the combined correspondence of five governor-generals across 36 years. In Hasluck’s correspondence about the 1974 double dissolution, he merely informs Charteris that he has dissolved parliament, rather than discussing political possibilities or seeking advice or input from the crown beforehand, as Kerr did. On 22 April 1974, he wrote to inform the crown he had dissolved parliament ten days earlier. “Although there had been much talk for some months past about the possibility of a double dissolution, the political crisis developed quickly and unexpectedly,” Hasluck wrote. “Ever since he came to office and faced a non-Labour majority in the Senate, the prime minister had taken some care to build up evidence to support a case for a double dissolution in case he ever found it advantageous to seek one. I doubt, however, whether he planned to make a submission at this time.” Hocking said that the “contrast could not be stronger” between Hasluck and Kerr’s letters. “[The letters] are just so different from Kerr’s – it’s really quite remarkable,” Hocking said. “He writes when he needs to and, most importantly, he reports on decisions after he has made them.” The newly released material is partly redacted. Hocking, who was still working her way through the documents late Friday, said the redactions were disappointing.",News/Australia news,Newly released royal letters reveal governor general’s breaches of protocol ahead of 1975 Whitlam dismissal ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/07/newly-released-royal-letters-reveal-governor-generals-breaches-of-protocol-ahead-of-1975-whitlam-dismissal
1/7/2022,"Australians may be unable to buy fresh produce at supermarkets while fruit and vegetables are left to rot on farms unless staff shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic are fixed, the industry’s peak body has warned. Michael Rogers, the chief executive of the Australian Fresh Produce Alliance, said there was a “significant risk” of such a situation.  The industry is calling for seven-day isolation times for close contacts who test negative to be done away with so that workers who are cleared of the disease can immediately return to work. He said the pandemic had halved the workforce available to some companies, with transport and distribution hubs worst hit so far. However, he said he expected that if nothing was done to address the staff shortage it would soon follow the spread of Covid-19 across Australia and hit farms and packing businesses in rural Australia. “Through all of Covid, the food supply chain was continuing to operate,” he said. “So we’re very realistic and pragmatic about the way forward. But what we’re trying to say is we’re in the worst position that we have been through Covid.” Exploding coronavirus numbers, which reached close to 80,000 on Friday, due to the highly infectious Omicron variant and the opening up of the economy, have kept people away from work as they either await a hard-to-find test, isolate because they have been a close contact or are sick. The lack of staff has pummelled businesses across the Australian economy, leading to cancelled flights, empty supermarket shelves and warnings that the meat supply is in danger. “We need to find a way to keep food moving through to supermarkets and keep food on shelves for Australians,” Rogers said. “We don’t want to get to a stage where we’re destroying food in a farm, at a paddock, because we can’t get it to the supermarket and Australians go to the supermarket and there’s not food on shelves.” Rogers said highly perishable vegetables including leafy greens and soft fruits were most in danger of disappearing from shops. “Anything that’s highly perishable is going to be the most vulnerable to disruption. So that’s why it’s important for us to make sure that the transport and logistics is operating and functioning because it takes pressure off the growing.” Small business and unions have repeatedly called for rapid antigen tests to be made free for small and medium-sized companies – something Rogers said was “on the table” but stopped short of endorsing. “My understanding from where we’re standing right now, is that: are there any tests available? I think that’s the first hurdle,” he said. “In an ideal world, yes, government would provide RAT tests free of charge to supply chain but that’s a lot of people, a lot of tests, a lot of different places.” Innes Willox, the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, also said people should be allowed to return to work immediately after getting a negative Covid test. “Businesses will face significant costs to provide rapid tests for their staff once suppy ramps up over the coming months,” he said. “Consideration needs to be given on how to reduce or reimburse these costs for businesses trying to keep their operations going.” Earlier this week, the prime minister acknowledged staff shortages caused by Covid isolation rules were taking a toll and said the federal government was considering how to address the problem. The prime minister has asked the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, to meet with state governments to discuss potential changes to workplace health and safety laws. A spokesman for Cash said on Thursday that the Morrison government “will work with state and territory governments to provide clarity to employers on rapid antigen testing requirements under WHS [work health and safety] laws”. “The attorney general is reaching out to WHS ministers to progress this work.”",News/Business,"Australians face worse fresh food shortages unless Covid isolation rules ease, industry warns",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/australians-face-worse-fresh-food-shortages-unless-covid-isolation-rules-ease-industry-warns

Without work and food, Paola agreed to deal drugs for a neighbourhood kingpin. She only had to deliver the drugs when her boss’s clients appeared on a street corner. With the money she made in the first few months, she was able to rent a room and live there with her newborn son.

She became addicted and, having no money, started stealing to buy more. One day, the police chased her in the narrow alleyways of a shantytown when she went to buy drugs. She escaped and hid in an abandoned house and fell asleep for an entire day. One week, she consumed 45 grams and stole 10,000 pesos. It could only end in two ways: a prison cell or a coffin. She got jail. “Thank God,” she says. “I got caught.

1/7/2022,"The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is considering how to reduce the impact of rising energy costs on Britain’s households. Since October the market price for natural gas has jumped from £2.50 a therm to £4.50 before dropping back to £1.70. In recent days it has begun to tick up again and on Wednesday it hit £2.23 a therm. To give a measure of the shock to the economy from rising energy prices, in January 2021 the price was about 50p a therm.  The last price cap increase, in October, pushed bills to an average of £1,277 a year for a dual-fuel bill. The next review is expected to push bills up by 50% to nearer £2,000. Kwarteng said he wanted to ease the pain on businesses and households, but he is up against a chancellor keen to maintain a tight hold on public finances. The government has options, but all have political and financial costs. At a cost of £2bn, Rishi Sunak could cut the 5% VAT rate on household energy. It was a move promised in the Brexit campaign by Boris Johnson among others as a mark of independence from EU VAT rules, and would help about 20m to 23m households. But the cut would offset only £75 to £100 of the expected £700 rise in bills. Labour has supported calls for a cut as a first move to supporting all those affected by the rising cost of living. Johnson has recently distanced himself from making the change, calling it a “blunt instrument”. A 1.25% rise in national insurance contributions for employees and employers from April, labelled the health and social care levy, will raise £14bn for the exchequer. The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, a low-tax campaigner, told his cabinet colleagues this week it would be bad politics to impose such a large burden on the workforce at a time of rising living costs. But a decision to scrap the reduction would benefit the better off as well as those on lower incomes, making it another blunt instrument. The regulator Ofgem could limit the rise in the energy price cap when it conducts a six-month review in April. If the government comes forward with a loan scheme for the industry, it would allow energy suppliers to smooth out the recent rise in costs over several years. The suppliers could borrow cheaply from the Treasury over the coming months and then repay loans from bills over subsequent years. It would mean that retail prices do not fall when wholesale prices drop, and would bake in higher energy prices for years to come. The warm homes discount (WHD) will need an overhaul if it is to come close to filling the expected £700-a-year increase in domestic gas and electricity bills due in April. Currently, households on a low income and in receipt of certain benefits receive £140 off their electricity bill, a sum that has not increased in nine years. Pensioners in receipt of pension credit automatically receive the money paid directly to their supplier. In December the charity AgeUK said more than 900,000 eligible pensioners were missing out on pension credit payments because they had not applied. Another group – those on low incomes and in receipt of a small number of benefits mostly open to people with disabilities or a child under five – are also eligible for WHD, but they have to apply for the money and hope their energy supplier is still accepting applications. Only suppliers with at least 250,000 customers are required to make the payments, and a number of the big firms including EDF, Scottish Power and Utility Warehouse have now closed their schemes for 2021-22. It leaves applicants having to switch suppliers to receive the money. Last year the government cut universal credit payments by £20 a week, saving the Treasury £6bn. The move took payments back to their pre-pandemic level and was offset by a lower marginal taper rate that allowed 2 million of the 6 million claimants on higher, though still modest, incomes to keep more of their benefits, at a cost of £2bn. A reinstatement of £10 a week would boost the incomes of the lowest paid by £600 a year at a cost of around £3bn to the Treasury. A windfall tax would aim to recoup some of the estimated £20bn spent by energy retailers on buying oil and gas at higher prices over the last year. But which firms should be targeted when so much oil and gas is sourced from overseas? If the 40% provided by North Sea gas producers fills the Treasury’s vision, some also play a part in government-backed carbon capture projects, probably triggering a backlash. When prices are volatile, determining the size of tax could also prove difficult.",News/Politics,The UK faces an energy bill crisis.

1/7/2022,"When is the NHS overwhelmed? When it has used up ways to describe the state it’s in. Ask Alastair McLellan, editor of the Health Service Journal. “We’ve run out of language,” he says. “We’ve exhausted the adverbs and adjectives, the thesaurus has run dry.” But when exactly did the NHS cross a red line? “I won’t provide a definition of what being overwhelmed would constitute,” Boris Johnson says wisely. Yet it’s happening now, and there’s no sign of the situation improving. TV news may need images of stretchers laid out on winter pavements, but ambulances were already queueing for hours outside A&Es before the pandemic. We hear of ambulance services telling patients with heart attacks and strokes to get a lift to hospital. Even during the winters before Covid, we’d grown used to trolleys lined up in corridors and 12-hour admission waits. GP appointments had long grown scarce. Cancer delays are the longest on record. Expect no tipping points: “This is the new normal,” a London teaching hospital medical director warns me.  The admirable NHS “copes”. It triages and triages again, treating people according to available beds and who is nearest to death. That’s rationing, a word politicians shun. Waiting used to be the traditional rationing mechanism in a financially capped system. There’s no mystery as to why this is happening: waiting lists rise and fall according to the level of funding. Seasoned observers used to assume queueing was a permanent function, until New Labour all but abolished waiting times, ensuring everyone was treated within 18 weeks from GP to hospital. During the post-2010 austerity years, funding increases fell behind the country’s growing, ageing population. By 2017, waiting lists had risen to just over 4 million. Let’s hope that despite the record infection rates we’ve seen in recent days, hospitalisations stay low enough so that the NHS still “copes”. If so, Johnson will get away with his high-risk plan B, with its new year pubbing and clubbing in the face of scientists’ concerns. But you wouldn’t praise someone for surviving a dash across the M1 with their eyes shut, especially if we all had to run across with him. Covid may calm to a low permanency within months, but what then for the NHS? In the trail of the pandemic is a fast-rising 6 million-strong waiting list – Sajid Javid even warns of far higher. Nigel Edwards, the Nuffield Trust’s chief executive, along with anyone else you ask, warns of exhausted staff and rising vacancies, with people quitting and retiring early, while long Covid and untreated illnesses add to the burden. According to the Royal College of Nursing, half of nurses are over 50, one in five leaves during training, one in three in their first year, while social care is even more bereft. A new report from the health and social care select committee blames the government for refusing to build a future workforce strategy. Perversely, former health secretary Jeremy Hunt’s amendment to the health and care bill, calling for a regular independent assessment on workforce estimates, was knocked down by the government in November, and Hunt’s demand for one kicked away again at PMQs this week. Staffing costs take up 70% of the NHS budget, so the Treasury knows that putting numbers on the needs of the next decade will expose severe underfunding. It takes 10 years to train a consultant and four years to train a nurse, but their training was one of the first things to be cut in 2010: more nursing places have been added since, but entire cohorts are still missing. The NHS England (NHSE) People Plan last year offered kindly advice on retaining staff, but the Treasury banned it from adding hard numbers for future needs. Health Education England held out for training funds, a sum that has still not been fixed, but the body has been punished and demoted, merged into NHSE and losing its voice to speak out. On Christmas Eve, NHSE produced 10 goals for the year, a wish list to send up the chimney asking for everything: “outstanding care”, “tackling the elective backlog”, “growth” in mental and community services – and much more. (There was no mention of Covid lessons or the need for permanent emergency preparation for the next contagion.) There will be no money for anything but bare-bones “coping”. The Financial Times’ annual poll of 100 economists predicts we will trail other rich countries in economic recovery this year. John Appleby, chief economist at the Nuffield Trust, warns that although the government promises the NHS £5.4bn in extra funding, hospitals have already overspent by £4-5bn, so much of that funding will vanish in repaying debts. Covid emergency money stops in April. The big question – for government and voters – is how much more they want to spend on health. Labour proved it’s not a “bottomless pit”, but you get what you pay for. Forget the groundswell of calls for “reform” from ignoramus Tory voices who imagine French and German “insurance” schemes magic up more private money. The only major difference from our national insurance is that they pay more and get more per head – beds, doctors, nurses and results. In this forever undertaxed country the tax revenue is 33% of GDP, while the 14 EU states pay an average 39%, according to the IFS. Would we pay that EU average? A bigger question: should we really spend such a high proportion on the NHS and care, weighted towards the last years of people my age, while education suffers? Teachers have seen their pay cut by 8% since 2007, while FE and schools are miserably threadbare, denuded of arts and sports. The unavoidable answer is yes, voters will put the NHS first: once the emergency passes the government will face angry patients. The sobering experience of Labour’s years, says Ben Page of Ipsos Mori, is that people waiting for hip and knee surgery notice no cut in waiting times until they drop right down to three months: anything above is unacceptable. But after the years of underfunding restoring the NHS to its 2010 state is unthinkable: that’s another 10-year project that requires high funding. The government itself may feel “overwhelmed” when public complaints at its decade of damage swells into an NHS political crisis, too late for any easy solutions.

1/7/2022,"The government’s failure to enable local politicians to meet virtually is hampering councils, worrying older councillors and shutting out new participants, according to Jackie Weaver, who shot to fame thanks to a video clip of an ill-tempered council meeting 10 months ago. Weaver, who became one of the most unlikely breakout stars of 2021 after footage from the Handforth parish council meeting she was attending went viral, has issued the rallying cry amid fears that current high infection rates could hit participation in local politics hard.  In April the high court ruled that from May council meetings in England must take place in person – after coronavirus restrictions which allowed virtual meetings lapsed. “It is completely unreasonable that we are having to cancel council meetings or hold them only in emergencies for goodness knows how long. Where is democracy?” said Weaver in an interview conducted, inevitably, over Zoom. This week Lawyers in Local Government launched a petition calling for councils to be allowed to meet remotely because “they know best” what type of meetings work in their area. After a tumultuous 10 months in which Weaver, the chief officer of the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, has played herself in the Archers, opened the Brit awards as “Weaver the Cleaver” and featured on Celebrity Mastermind, she is also calling for legislation that will, once again, allow council meetings to be held online. The public can only hope that it will lead to more filmed exchanges like the Handforth meeting that gripped the nation in the dark days of last February’s lockdown, when Weaver was commanded by Aled’s iPad to: “Read the standing orders, read them and understand them!” Weaver said: “Despite everyone and their cat and dog saying it should be local councils that are able to determine how they hold meetings, that legislation has lapsed and the impact is quite profound. “Because of the demographics of many of our parish councils, we have a lot of parish councillors still very reluctant to attend. And should we even be encouraging attendance?” She said the lack of virtual meetings was a blow to the government’s “levelling up” agenda, making democratic participation more difficult for those with caring responsibilities and disabilities. A recent Local Government Association (LGA) survey of councils, conducted before the emergence of Omicron, found that 72% had recorded a drop in councillor attendance at statutory council meetings and 73% had reported a fall in public attendance. The LGA has called on the government to urgently bring forward emergency legislation, saying the gathering of up to 200 people in one room is an “unnecessary public health risk”. James Jamieson, the chair of the LGA, said emergency legislation would help curb the spread of the virus and make sure “councils can continue to make democratic decisions, even during times of emergency”. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said it was considering a call for evidence on the matter, which closed on 17 June, and would be responding shortly. Reflecting on the year that made her a particularly British type of hero, Weaver said that while she relished being given the “opportunity on a plate” to spread the word about the importance of local government, the line between Jackie the local government champion and Jackie Weaver the viral star had become blurred in recent months. “I can’t say it annoys me, that just would be ungrateful,” she said. “But at the same time, it costs.” But with the no-nonsense good humour that saw her booting several Handforth parish councillors out of the meeting during the infamous fracas – two have since stepped down – she brushed off any suggestion she was indulging in a “pity party”, expressing her dislike of moaners and admiration for people who get stuck in. “People feel like the only way you effect change is from the top, and I don’t subscribe to that at all,” she said. “I think often we end up doing nothing, because we can’t change the world.” As for her own future, after writing a book, You Do Have the Authority Here, based on her own wisdom, she “doesn’t have a plan as such” for this year beyond calmly carrying out her day job and continuing to bang the drum for local government. “I hope that every time we’re coming up to elections, there is something that helps us capture ordinary people’s imaginations and makes them feel that they actually can make a difference,” she said. “For me, that is always the most important thing.”",News/Society,Jackie Weaver pleads for return of online council meetings,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/07/jackie-weaver-pleads-for-return-of-online-council-meetings
1/7/2022," The lack of closure at the end of season two of Ricky Gervais’s tragicomic study of bereavement felt deliberate – after all, grief never really ends. The challenge for this final season is to combine narrative progression with something psychologically plausible. In the opening episode, local newspaper reporter Tony (Gervais) is sent to interview an author and medium, which feels like Gervais pondering his frequently proclaimed atheism. As a writer, he still lurches violently between saccharine sentimentality and snark.

Well, it’s a little messy but I’m in the process of trying to clean it up.” The second season of Lena Waithe’s brisk, sparky LA-set drama, which puts Black LGBTQ+ characters front and centre, sees Hattie (Jonica T Gibbs) continuing to try to navigate young adulthood. After her seduction by Sophina Brown’s beguiling Ida B, Hattie is working on a new relationship with a different power dynamic. She’s also trying to move her film script into the next phase. Elsewhere, Mari (Christina Elmore) and Nia (Gabrielle Graham) are facing dilemmas of their own. PHBBC iPlayer, from Sunday 9 January “Can one journalist really change anything?” The recent furore over partying politicians has demonstrated the impact that good journalism can have – and this Japanese series is an attempt to reposition journalists as glamorous, truth-telling heroes. Anna Matsuda (Ryoko Yonekura) has a similar TV presence to a maverick, rule-breaking cop as she digs into a high-stakes corruption case that no one else wants to touch. Before long, she’s following a trail leading to the very top and, inevitably, giving her editor considerable pause for thought in the process. PHNetflix, from Thursday 13 January Through wordplay, storytelling and a lot of catchy beats, female rappers have been saying it like it is since the first pioneers shook things up in 70s America. Cheryl Renee James (Salt of Salt-N-Pepa) narrates this one-off special celebrating the legacy of female rap and speaking with its legends such as MC Lyte – a lyrical genius who confidently responded to the oppression of women, and the first female MC to release a solo album on a major label. HRDisney+, from Friday 14 January The never-ending small-screen European crime wave continues, this time with a drama based on real-life events that took place in northern Germany in the summer of 1989. It’s a patient affair – this murder investigation spans 30 years and was triggered by the disappearance of the sister of a high-ranking police officer from Hamburg. The officer, Thomas Bethge (played by Matthias Brandt), was on holiday in the area at the time and, inevitably, found himself dragged into the case. A drama that gives up its secrets slowly but rewardingly. PHAll 4, from Friday 14 January Equal parts supernatural horror and doomed, time-hopping romance, this new series takes the “found footage” trope used in films such as The Blair Witch Project and gives it a twist. Dina Shihabi plays Melody Pendras, a documentary film-maker whose investigation into a mysterious cult in 1994 ended suddenly. Dan Turner (Mamoudou Athie) is the modern-day video archivist who becomes emotionally invested in her fate after taking on the job of piecing together her recordings. But what will he discover about the cult and Melody’s connection to them? PHNetflix, from Friday 14 January This wild, stop-motion animated miniseries is arguably Netflix’s freakiest endeavour to date. It’s a long way from Wallace and Gromit, as within the spooky old pile of the title, three surreal stories jostle for space – seemingly separate and yet tangentially connected. However, the real fun is found in the gratuitously strange visual flourishes: this is a world of dancing cockroaches, anthropomorphic cats and spooky, blank-faced puppets coming to life. Matthew Goode and Helena Bonham Carter are among the actors lending their voices to these abominations.

1/7/2022,"Boris Johnson should bar Bain & Company from lucrative government contracts in light of a judicial commission’s findings about the management consultancy’s “despicable” role in state corruption in South Africa, Peter Hain has said. In a letter shared with the Guardian, the former Labour minister and anti-apartheid campaigner urged Johnson to “immediately freeze all government contracts with Bain” and to advise all public bodies to do the same.  Lord Hain said the measure should be taken unless Bain fully cooperates with South African prosecutors and investigators, who are investigating alleged corruption under the former president Jacob Zuma. Hain’s demand comes after a South African judicial commission investigating state capture and corruption concluded there had been “collusion” between Bain and Zuma to reshape entire sectors of the economy. In the first of three reports, the commission found that between 2012 and 2015 Bain helped draw up plans to “seize and restructure” the South African Revenue Service (Sars) and centralise procurement procedures – changes that the report said would facilitate corruption. Bain allegedly first established connections in South African politics via two artists, who were paid R3.6m (£170,000) a year as part of an arrangement that made little business sense but opened doors to senior lawmakers. According to emails reviewed by the commission, a finance director in Bain’s London office, Geoff Smout, raised concerns that the relationship “seems very dodgy”, while Wendy Miller, the head of marketing, said it might not pass the “sunshine test”, meaning the reaction if it were known about publicly. Bain allegedly knew in advance that a new Sars chief was due to be appointed and provided him with a “first 100 days” plan to overhaul the service, despite it being highly rated by independent assessments of efficiency. In 2014 Bain benefited from the extension of a six-week contract into a R164m (£8m) contract to advise Sars over 27 months, responding to a tender document that the company had helped to draft, according to the report. The commission cited internal emails that suggest Bain knew that it did not have the expertise to perform the work but went ahead anyway. A section of its proposals published by the commission included advice to “identify individuals to neutralise” within Sars. In evidence to the commission, Bain said this did not mean that opponents of its plans for the revenue service should face any kind of punishment but that they should be persuaded to be “neutral” towards its proposals. The commission relied in part upon evidence from a former Bain employee, Athol Williams, who was hired by the management consultancy to look into what had happened but resigned because he felt the company was not being transparent with him. Bain made numerous attempts to offer Williams “large sums of money in return for his silence”, according to the commission’s report. In Hain’s letter to Johnson, the peer wrote that Bain’s actions were “despicable”. He said South Africa “had its tax collection and enforcement capabilities massively and systematically damaged during the Zuma administration, rendering it ineffective in enforcing tax compliance. “Shamefully, the commission found that this serious damage to Sars’s tax raising capacity resulted directly from deliberate actions, including by a prominent global corporation operating in the UK, Bain & Company.” The letter continued: “That a multinational company such as Bain would act as a willing and knowing accomplice to corruption by those intent on undermining the South African state and its democracy, is outrageous. I therefore find it completely unacceptable that Bain & Co is licensed to operate commercially in the UK and is endorsed by your government by contracting for work with government departments and public sector bodies.” Bain, which is based in Boston, Massachusetts, is a leading global management consultancy that frequently benefits from multimillion pound contracts with the UK government. They include a £30m contract to provide consultancy services to the Cabinet Office for the year ending August 2021, and £25m advising the same department on Brexit between 2018 and 2020. It has also worked for NHS England, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, the energy regulator Ofgem and the Ministry of Defence. Bain was founded in 1973 by Bill Bain, a former group vice-president of Boston Consulting Group. Bain was later led by Mitt Romney, who went on to be the Republican party’s presidential nominee in 2012, losing out to Barack Obama. Bain & Co also spawned the $150bn hedge fund Bain Capital, which was co-founded by Romney and which recently failed in a £530m bid to buy LV= after members of the British mutual rebelled against the deal. In a statement, Bain said: “We accept that through various lapses in leadership and governance, Bain South Africa became an unwitting participant in a process that inflicted serious damage on Sars, for which we apologise. “While the commission highlighted mistakes on our part and made a number of recommendations, we remain confident that we did not in any way wilfully or knowingly support state capture at Sars. We have offered full cooperation to enforcement authorities and will continue to do so. We have since taken comprehensive action to ensure that we do not repeat our past mistakes.” The company said it had paid back the money it made from the Sars contract. Zuma has denied wrongdoing and refused to cooperate with the inquiry, leading to his imprisonment in July for contempt of court.",News/Business,Calls for UK to bar Bain & Co from contracts over South Africa corruption,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/calls-for-uk-to-bar-bain-co-from-contracts-over-south-africa-corruption
1/7/2022,"On 6 January 2021, it seemed like the stitching holding America’s democracy together might finally collapse. As armed supporters of a defeated president laid siege to the Capitol, the US Congress did something extraordinary – it suspended the official procedure to certify the winner of a presidential election. The attack was eventually put down and Congress returned to officially certify Joe Biden’s victory. “They tried to disrupt our democracy. They failed,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said when the Senate came back into session.  But the effort to disrupt and undermine American democracy didn’t end on 6 January. In fact, it has speeded up over the 12 months since then. Working in state legislatures across the US, Republicans have launched a methodical effort to undermine the post-election processing of votes and the people who count them. One year after the effort to steal the 2020 election for Donald Trump failed, Republicans have put in place machinery to ensure future attempts could be successful. The potential for a stolen election in the US is higher than ever. In recent years there has been growing alarm over the way the Republican party has eagerly embraced voter suppression – efforts to change election rules to make it harder to vote. But what’s happening now, experts say, is new – an effort to take control of the administration of elections and vote counting itself. “What we’re seeing is an unprecedented, multi-pronged assault on the foundations of our democracy,” said Wendy Weiser, who directs the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice. “We’re really seeing an all-out effort to undermine election administration in America.” Republicans have built this attack around three pillars. First, they have encouraged and fomented doubt about the results of the 2020 election. Second, they have passed new laws that inject more partisanship into election administration. And third, they have sought to take over key election offices from which they could exert enormous unilateral power over vote-counting and post-election certification. Republicans have taken the idea of a stolen election from the fringes of political discourse and made it party orthodoxy. Senior Republicans have castigated fellow members who have contested claims the election was illegitimate. At the state level, Republicans have continued to spread false accusations about the 2020 vote and embraced unusual and partisan reviews of the 2020 election that have used shoddy methodology to question the results. In Arizona, Republicans hired Cyber Ninjas, a firm with no election experience to lead a widely panned review of the election results in the state’s largest county. The final report affirmed Biden’s win, but also suggested there were irregularities. The claims were immediately explained and debunked. In Wisconsin, Republican legislators authorized their own post-election inquiry, led by a former state supreme court justice who has hired partisan staffers, threatened to jail mayors of some of the state’s biggest cities and said he doesn’t know how elections work. In 2020, Trump allies pushed state lawmakers in Georgia and Arizona to reject the popular vote in their state and choose their own electors. That effort was unsuccessful. But the focus on undermining the 2020 results now appears to be laying the groundwork to allow lawmakers to successfully do this in 2024 and beyond, said Jessica Marsden, a lawyer at Protect Democracy who is tracking election subversion efforts. “In both Arizona and Georgia, you had the governors not willing to go along with that game, they would have been doing that quite explicitly to throw out the vote of their own constituents,” Marsden said. “What the disinformation campaign does is try to lower the political cost of throwing out election results by creating a lot of uncertainty about what the true results were.” The effort appears to be working – 71% of Republicans believe Biden’s victory was not legitimate, according to a recent UMass Amherst poll. There was also a surge of bills last year that sought to interfere with election administration in 2021. As of mid-December last year, 262 election interference bills had been introduced in 41 states, according to the States United Democracy Center. Thirty-two of those bills have become law in 17 states. Among them is a new law in Georgia that gives state lawmakers the authority to review local election boards and replace them if the state election board determines they are underperforming. Separate from that law, Georgia Republicans have also quietly acted to remove Democrats from their positions on county election boards. A new Arkansas law allows state officials to investigate irregularities and remove local election officials from their posts if needed. In Wisconsin, Ron Johnson, a Republican US senator, has suggested that the Republican-controlled legislature should unilaterally assert control of federal elections, eliminating the six-member bipartisan commission that runs elections in the state. Republicans in the state legislature have also called for criminal punishment for members of the commission as well as its non-partisan administrator. “What’s going in Wisconsin is sort of the canary in the coalmine of what is spreading across the United States,” said Ann Jacobs, a Democrat who chairs the six-person panel that oversees elections in Wisconsin. “There is a faction of the Republican party that is openly embracing the idea that people’s votes should not count.” Beyond laws, Republicans who believe the election was stolen have also launched an aggressive effort to win elections for secretary of state, the top election official in many places. They are targeting offices in Michigan, Georgia, Nevada and Wisconsin, all key swing states where secretaries played a key role in ensuring a fair vote count in 2020. In Michigan, Republicans have also tapped election deniers to serve on local canvassing boards, responsible for local election certification, in several counties, a role from which they could cause significant damage in future elections. That effort comes as a flood of election officials have left their jobs in the last year facing a flood of harassment and other threats, opening up opportunities for inexperienced and partisan workers to fill the void. It has raised fears over what might happen in 2024’s presidential election, especially if Trump runs again. Democrats are still seeking a way to block this kind of subversion. The Freedom to Vote Act, one of two sweeping voting rights bills stalled in Congress, would prohibit the removal of election officials without cause and strengthens protections for election workers. It also requires the use of paper ballots, creating a paper trail to verify after an election, and sets minimum election standards around election rules. But even though Democrats have pledged they will find a way to pass the bill, they have yet to find a way around the filibuster to do so. While Democrats try to find a way forward, Weiser, the Brennan Center expert, noted the Republicans campaign already appeared to be succeeding. “We have vote suppression measures in place. We have qualified, professional election administrators across the country having left their positions,” she said. “We have candidates for election office at the gubernatorial level saying that they would refuse to certify election results if it didn’t turn out a certain way. “We already have significant damage to our electoral system that’s already in place. That we’re already going to be living with.”",News/US news,Assault on American democracy has gained pace since US Capitol attack,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/07/assault-on-american-democracy-has-gained-pace-since-us-capitol-attack
1/7/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray returning to you with Friday’s briefing. Other briefings may be available – but why take the risk?  Boris Johnson has been accused of potential corruption by Labour as it emerged he sought funds for his flat refurbishment from a Conservative donor while promising to consider plans for a “great exhibition”. WhatsApp messages with the Tory peer David Brownlow show Johnson called parts of his Downing Street residence a “tip” and asked for “approvals” so his decor designer, Lulu Lytle, could “get on with it” in November 2020. He signed off the message by saying: “Ps am on the great exhibition plan Will revert.” Lord Brownlow replied: “Of course, get Lulu to call me and we’ll get it sorted ASAP! Thanks for thinking about GE2.” Plans for a “Great Exhibition 2.0” were discussed by Brownlow and the then culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, weeks after the WhatsApp exchanges, official records show. On Thursday, Johnson was forced to make a “humble and sincere” apology for the texts not being given to his independent ethics adviser, Lord Geidt, during an initial inquiry last spring. Johnson said he had not remembered them and did not have access to his phone due to “security issues” – thought to relate to when his mobile number was discovered online. In thinly veiled frustration, Geidt said the saga “shook my confidence” and added that if he had seen the evidence when writing his first report, he may not have ruled that Johnson tried to make the correct declaration and seek advice at the first opportunity. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said it appeared Brownlow had access to Johnson and Dowden “because he was paying” for the refurbishments. She said if true, it would constitute “corruption, plain and simple … No one should be able to buy access or exchange wallpaper for festivals”. The WhatsApp messages were published as part of letters exchanged by Johnson and Geidt. For a second time, Geidt found the prime minister did not break the ministerial code over payments for the Downing Street flat refurbishment, but Johnson was criticised for acting “unwisely”. No 10 denied there was anything untoward about Brownlow’s meeting with Dowden and stressed the peer had acted with integrity since first being approached to chair the Downing Street trust. Brownlow was contacted for comment. Kazakhstan roils – Dozens of protesters and at least 12 police have died in the violence in Kazakhstan, authorities have said, as demonstrators said peaceful protests over fuel price rises had turned violent after a heavy-handed government response. “Peacekeepers” led by Russia have arrived in the country at the request of president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who declared a state of emergency and accepted the resignation of the government. Ahead of a national address today, Tokayev is claiming this morning that constitutional order has largely been restored. Witnesses in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city, described scenes of chaos on Thursday, with government buildings being stormed or set on fire and widespread looting. The interior ministry said 2,298 people had been arrested during the unrest, while the police spokesperson Saltanat Azirbek told the state news channel Khabar-24 that “dozens of attackers were liquidated”. Video footage showed violent clashes between protesters and authorities in a number of cities. ‘The lies have not abated’ – One year after the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol, Joe Biden has denounced Donald Trump for spreading a “web of lies” about the legitimacy of the 2020 election and holding a “dagger at the throat of American democracy”. Biden called Trump a “defeated former president” whose “bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or constitution … For the first time in our history, the president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol. But they failed.” Biden asked Americans to recommit to the protection of the nation’s 200-year-old system of government. “The lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated.” The Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, called the attack “antithetical to the rule of law” and said he supported efforts to hold perpetrators accountable. But he did not denounce Trump, as he and many Republicans did in the aftermath of the attack. Presiding over the House floor on Thursday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared that democracy had prevailed when members returned to the Capitol after the riot to ratify Biden’s electoral victory. “The Congress, because of the courage of all of you, rose to honour our oath and protect our democracy,” she said, before leading members – all of them Democrats, with the exception of congresswoman Liz Cheney – in a moment of silence. School scramble for fill-in staff – Schools in England are “teetering on the edge” with more than a third (36%) struggling with staff absence rates in excess of 10%, according to a snap poll by a headteachers’ union. Some heads had more than 20% of their teaching staff absent on the first day of term for Covid-related reasons. In some schools, heads have had to send classes or year groups home for online learning, or combine classes or year groups. More than a third (37%) needing supply teachers were unable to obtain them. Elsewhere, there have been reports of resistance among some pupils to masks and lateral flow testing. More Covid news from home and abroad at our live blog. Final shutdown – The Hunterston B nuclear power station in Scotland will shut down for ever at noon today after 46 years of service, reducing the UK’s nuclear capacity by one-eighth and prompting calls from the industry for greater government backing. It lasted 20 years beyond its initial planned shutdown date. About 20% of Britain’s supply comes from 15 reactors, and almost half of this capacity is scheduled for retirement by 2025 with the closure of Hunterston B, Hinkley Point B, Hartlepool 1 and Heysham 1. EDF is due to finish its new 3.2GW plant Hinkley Point C by 2027, with the first of its two reactors coming online a year before that. The Nuclear Industry Association estimates the national capacity could reach 14.25GW by 2035, depending on whether £1.7bn in funding for the proposed Sizewell C plant is confirmed and the Wylfa Newydd project on Anglesey can attract investors. Don’t choke on your cereal – The bosses of Britain’s biggest companies will have made more money in 2022 by breakfast time today than the average UK worker will earn in the entire year, according to analysis of the vast gap in pay between FTSE 100 chief executives and everyone else.

The Financial Times splashes with the anniversary of the Congress attack: “Biden fears threat to democracy one year on from Capitol assault”. The Express says “Cost of living squeeze will hit over-65s hardest” – their energy bills could rise by £340 a year. The Telegraph is on the cost of living crisis too, with “One million to be pulled into higher rate of tax”. The Colston statue verdict is met with outrage in the Daily Mail, which has “PM: vandals can’t change our history”. The Times’ top story is “Second Maxwell juror was abused”.

1/7/2022,"Bridgnorth has one of England’s oldest cliff railways, a holiday cottage with a hidden cave and a tower that leans more than Pisa’s. But I’ve been drawn to south-east Shropshire by the prospect of bracing winter hikes, friendly pubs and a trip to the sights of Shrewsbury. I arrive in Bridgnorth by bus from Wolverhampton (£3.90). The steep, atmospheric cliff railway (£2 return) carries me up to the High Town just as a rainbow arcs across the valley below.  There are views across the River Severn to wooded red cliffs from nearby Castle Walk, which leads to the 18th-century church of Saint Mary Magdalen, designed by bridge-builder and engineer Thomas Telford. The sandstone castle next to it was blown up by Roundheads and now leans at 15 degrees – four times the angle of the tower of Pisa – among bright beds of begonias. The impression of colour and eccentric angles continues as I step off steep, curving Railway Street into the Alice-in-Wonderland sitting room of Dracup’s Cottage, where I’m staying. There’s a patchwork sofa, a crooked mirror and a clock that runs backwards, but this room is merely quirky. The rest of the cottage is a masterclass in idiosyncrasy, from the steampunk bathroom to the surreal murals in one upstairs room: it’s a Hieronymus-Bosch-style Bridgnorth landscape with contortionists, naked hot-air ballooners and a giant carnivorous chameleon. The artist Antony Dracup lived in this old railway cottage for decades; Karolina and Jason Harte bought it in 2019 and have spent two years doing it up. I open a door at the back of the cottage to find medieval music playing in a gothic pillared vault lit by flickering candles. Dracup chiselled this space out of the sandstone hillside and used the excavated sand to create bricks for the supporting arches. The station-themed kitchen is inspired by the Severn Valley Railway, a few steps down the hill. The full-size, mostly steam-hauled line runs for 16 miles between Bridgnorth and Kidderminster. It’s great for linear walks along the long-distance Severn Way. I’ve hit a seasonal lull in the train timetable so catch bus 297 instead, passing through the woods around Dudmaston Hall. I get off in the village of Alveley and walk down Chapel Lane into the Severn Valley country park. There are clear views of the Clee Hills, including Shropshire’s highest peaks, topped with iron age forts or radar scanners. Until 1969, the park was a mine, producing 300,000 tons of coal a year at its height. A new history trail, opened in 2020, passes traces of ropeways, spoil heaps and miners’ cottages. Today the wooded paths are thick with birds and berries: I spot a rust-red-slate-grey chaffinch and a flock of long-tailed tits. There are wreaths of orange bryony twisted through yellow hedges spangled with neon-pink spindle berries. I follow the trails to a footbridge over the rain-swollen Severn. Bridgnorth is eight miles upstream and the riverside path is grassy and inviting, with mossy hawthorn trees and huge gaggles of mallards. There are signs of fierce flooding: bundles of reeds are lodged in upper branches, and snagged and ragged sheets of polythene flap in the racing current like Halloween ghosts. At the hamlet of Lower Forge, halfway to Bridgnorth, you can leave the river and catch bus 125, passing Eardington nature reserve, once a sand and gravel quarry, and Daniel’s Mill, a working 18th-century watermill near the Severn Valley Railway viaduct. For supper, I go to the Royle, a half-timbered pub and restaurant on Bridgnorth’s High Street. It’s a weeknight but the place is buzzing. Landlords Chris and Anna Walsh built up a following during their years at the King’s Head over the road. At the Royle, Chris is both affable pub landlord and knowledgable restaurant host. The food is hard to fault: three crisp and delicate bhajis under cucumber ribbons and coriander leaves and a rich salmon wellington with a layer of shallots and mushrooms. Bridgnorth’s friendliness is remarkable. As I’m having breakfast outside Coffee at d’Arcy’s next morning, several passing strangers say hello. I meet Sally Themans, founder of community group Love Bridgnorth, to talk about the town’s thriving high street. She’s just come from the opening of a new artisan jewellery shop. The streets nearby are fizzing with eco-friendly, independent shops: you can fill your own pot with nuts or lentils at Room for Refills, or head to Roobarb over the road for a bobble hat with its fleecy lining recycled from old plastic bottles. I catch bus 436 to Much Wenlock (£2.70 single) and spend the day striding on ancient stony tracks along the limestone cliff of Wenlock Edge through flaming gold beeches and yellowing hazel trees. The same bus, next morning, carries me all the way to Shrewsbury past views of the isolated Wrekin. Shropshire’s river-circled county town has lots of options for all-weather sightseeing, including a good market. You can stash bags at the Premier Inn near the station for £6. Simon Jenkins names three Shrewsbury churches in his England’s Thousand Best Churches and I duly admire the octagonal tower and circular nave of Georgian Saint Chads and the Norman doorway of the red sandstone abbey with its mix of windows above. “Seven lights rise to Perpendicular panel tracery, fracturing into Decorated reticulation,” Jenkins writes. Sure, but is there a cafe? Saint Mary’s, a soaring town-centre beauty, caters for both soul and body. I have a coffee and watch multicoloured light pour through six centuries of stained glass on to Victorian floor tiles under a carved oak ceiling. Next up is the town’s free museum and art gallery, a neoclassical former concert hall that counts Telford’s measuring wheel among its treasures. Natural images recur through the millennia: flowers on a silver Roman mirror, ravens on a carved Tudor four-poster, butterflies on fine Caughley porcelain. Nearby Okra, a vegan cafe opened in October 2019, does salads and noodle bowls. My warm flatbread (£7) is sliced through, revealing a fresh rainbow of green leaves, carrot, red cabbage, roasted aubergine, chickpeas and chutney. After lunch, I walk through the Dingle, a bench-lined garden in a former quarry, down an avenue of lime trees, and over the disconcertingly bouncy Port Hill suspension footbridge. The Boathouse pub, on the far side of the Severn, serves Darwin’s Origin copper ale from the Salopian Brewery. (Charles Darwin was born in Shrewsbury). It takes 15 minutes to stagger from here along the river to the station, past a Darwin-inspired riverside archway called Quantum Leap. The trains home run smoothly while a pink sunset glows and fades to black outside the windows. Train travel to Wolverhampton was provided by Avanti West Coast (advance tickets from £10.80). Accommodation was provided by Dracup’s Cottage (sleeps two from £125 a night, two-nights minimum, dracupscottage.co.uk).
