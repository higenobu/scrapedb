3/22/2022,"The New South Wales Liberal MP Tanya Davies has hit out at her government over its Covid vaccination mandates for the public sector, claiming she has been working with the premier, Dominic Perrottet, to end them and get people back into jobs. Speaking at an anti-vaccination rally outside parliament on Tuesday, the former minister said she was “dismayed” when her government introduced the measure and called for a return to “freedom”. “It’s been now nearly six months that he’s been premier and I’m now saying: ‘Alright, you’ve had six months, now’s the time to take the stand and lead this NSW community out of this Covid-fear panic’,” she said. “Give us back our freedoms to go and earn an income. “I have been working with the new premier and his office … to give him a chance to actually get more evidence to say that Covid is not the deadly disease that is going to eradicate millions of people in Australia.” The opposition leader, Chris Minns, called on the premier to pull Davies into line, saying her attendance at a rally – where other speakers claimed there were “pedophiles in the parliament” and “9/11 [was an] inside job” – was not appropriate. Minns said Perrottet needed to “take action”. “It needs to be told for what it is: dangerous misinformation that spreads around the community and undermines community confidence, confidence in important public health messages,” he said. The premier, who was on leave after the birth of his seventh child, had been contacted for comment. Davies was promoted to parliamentary secretary for planning under the premier’s most recent cabinet shuffle. She has previously been minister for women, ageing and for mental health, and has been the member for Mulgoa since 2011.

3/22/2022,"Stormy rains are forecast to return to eastern Australia, including over flood-hit regions of northern New South Wales and south-east Queensland, ending the longest dry spell many areas have had for a month. Last month’s widespread rains that were fed from an atmospheric river of moist tropical air dumped persistent heavy rain over towns like Lismore. This time, though, the forecast rain from Wednesday onwards is “going to be all storm-related”, Jordan Notara, a senior Bureau of Meteorology forecaster, said. A frontal system will move through Sydney on Wednesday morning, bank around the Blue Mountains and form a line of storms up through the Hunter Valley and the mid-north coast, he said. Thursday’s unstable conditions will shift further north, with the northern tablelands rather than Lismore more likely to get a soaking. Friday, though, is where the “problem comes in”, as uncertainties between weather models create a range of projections about the location and quantity of rain, Notara said. The eight-day forecast continues to point to rising rainfall totals along the NSW coast. Not great news for flood-hit towns in the north. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/q4hIoLWjWR “We have still got quite a lot of moisture coming across,” he said. “There is obviously a risk that in isolated areas of the state, you could get a high amount of rainfall in a small pocket on any of the days into the next seven days really.” As of Tuesday afternoon, the bureau was predicting as much as 15mm of rain for Lismore on Thursday, up to 30mm on Friday, with days of showers extending into next week. For Sydney, falls could reach 10mm on Wednesday before rising to as much as 20mm and 25mm on Thursday and Friday. Inland areas such as Penrith and Richmond, which were flood-hit earlier this month, can expect as much as 35mm on Friday, currently the wettest day in the bureau’s forecast period. Widespread rain is likely to affect parts of eastern Australia during the coming week. Models are still figuring out where & how much rain will fall. At this stage, parts of Qld & NSW will be affected and some areas are likely to see heavy rain, possibly enough to cause flooding. pic.twitter.com/O4IcCOQ0XE Ben Domensino, a senior Weatherzone meteorologist, said Sydney had collected 931.6mm of rain so far in 2022, placing it the second wettest start to any year. In 1956, the city had just over 1 metre of rain to this point. Depending on how wet the next five days are, this year may reclaim the top spot, he said. The European model, for instance, is indicating 100mm of accumulated rain by Sunday, but others forecast less. An upper-level trough is moving in from the west, generating the instability as it hits warmer and moist air coming in off the Tasman Sea. However, forecasters were not seeing any strong suggestions of another east coast low to form offshore, which would likely intensify the rain and wind should one develop. Sydney's dams remain at 99%-plus full, including Warragamba at 100, thanks to on-going rains over the past week. More to come in the next couple of days. pic.twitter.com/e04D1o6WuT “A large area in eastern Australia from central Queensland down to southern NSW will be affected by rain and thunderstorms between about mid this week out to early next week,” Domensino said. “Anywhere that’s recently had flooding in eastern Australia, and anyone living in those areas, should keep a close eye on the forecasts and the warnings over the next week,” he said. “The ground is saturated and there is potential for heavy falls from this system.” Sydney’s dams won’t need much rain to resume spilling. Across the network they are sitting at 99.6% full, with the main dam at Warragamba at capacity, according to WaterNSW. #Insurers have received 157,254 #claims related to the #SEQ & #NSW #floods, a 2.3% increase on yesterday’s figs. Based on previous #flood events the estimated current cost of #claims is now $2.359 bn. pic.twitter.com/GVx500qvum Flood-hit areas in the east coast were still to restore some services. As of 4pm Tuesday, 1,083 customers remained without power across Lismore, Essential Energy said. “Additionally, 2,748 customers remain disconnected from the network due to flood inundation and are awaiting inspection by a private electrician,” Essential said. The insured loss claims continued to mount from the NSW and Queensland floods, and now exceeded $2.35bn, the Insurance Council of Australia said. Uninsured losses were higher still.

3/22/2022,"In December I ordered a radiator from Screwfix which, rather than being picked up at my local store, was delivered to my home. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the right size so I needed to return it. My local Screwfix, which will usually take things back without a problem, said it had to be collected from my house. This was a bit of a pain but I accepted this, and it was picked up in January. Since then, I have been waiting for the £133 refund. The company has confirmed that it received the item but the money has not appeared in my account, despite repeated requests. NR, Herts This was something of a first: a complaint about Screwfix, which I think generally has excellent customer service.

3/22/2022,"Parents already feeling the squeeze from higher food and energy bills could soon be facing higher childcare costs as nurseries struggle to stay open amid their own surging energy bills and higher staff costs. Research by the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) found that 95% of nurseries in England did not have enough funding to cover their basic costs after the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their incomes, while 85% said they would run at a loss or break even this year. In April, nursery finances will be squeezed even further by a 6.6% rise in the national living wage, a 1.25-percentage-point rise in national insurance, and a sharp rise in the cost of heating and electricity bills. More than 11,000 childcare places were lost during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the NDNA, as 232 nurseries closed between April 2020 and March 2022. Separate data released by the Early Years Alliance found a fall in registered childcare providers of 2,595 in just five months between December 2020 and May 2021. Government funding for help covering childcare costs for eligible two- to four-year-olds will rise in April, but at less than the rate of inflation. According to providers, it falls far below what is needed to keep nurseries running. Emma White is the owner of two private nurseries in Suffolk: Small World Kindergarten in Ipswich and Woodlands Nursery in Kersey Mill near Hadleigh. She said she might have to raise fees in the coming months to cover increasing costs or face closure in the future. While funding is going up by 4%, roughly £6,000 a year across the two nurseries, her annual wage bill is going up by £15,000 from April. “Most of our staff are on minimum wage or above. And these payment increases are so well deserved – they have worked all the way through Covid. What makes it difficult for us is that they are not being mirrored in the amount the government give us and they are expecting nurseries to take the hit personally when there is very little left to pay themselves.” And there are other costs to contend with. “We have to keep doors and windows open in the nursery for ventilation because of Covid, which means the heating has to be kept on,” she said. “Within months, our heating bill has gone up by a third and will go up again in April.” Rising interest rates mean repayments on a loan to cover the nursery’s loss of income during the pandemic have gone up from £854.16 to £935.95 in two months. White recently had to cut a management role to help balance the books, and while that will help to postpone putting up fees imminently, it is still ultimately the only option. More flexible working patterns for parents since Covid mean that reduced nursery opening times may also have to be a consideration in the long run. “Ultimately, it will become unaffordable for parents to go back to work, which means I will have even less private income coming back to the nursery, and I won’t be able to support an 8am to 6pm day,” she said. “What is going to happen next winter, when income is lower, if we can’t make any money over the summer? What will be left to carry the business on?” It is not just nursery owners who are feeling the pinch. Degree-holding early years practitioners, such as Kelly Barclay, are also struggling. Barclay works at the Shotley Bridge nursery school in Derwentside, County Durham and is looking for a second job to relieve the financial strain she is facing due to the increase in the cost of living. “We are on the national living wage, our bills are going up, there’s a lot of sickness among the staff, and once my bills come out, I am in my overdraft again,” she said. “People think we go to work and just play with the kids, but we don’t, we are getting them ready to go to school, teaching them respect, and it’s incredibly important for the rest of their lives. The living wage is not reflective of how important the job we do is – we are worth a lot more. “I’m trying to get a cleaning job a couple of nights a week, but I’m struggling to find something to fit with my hours. “Currently, I am paying £173 for my gas and electricity, which I think is unreal. There is only me and my son at home. I took a Covid break on my rent, so I’m paying back that. So we are wrapping up warm and keeping the heating down. I fear I’m never going to get out of my overdraft, and have to keep paying the fees, even when wages go up in April.” Jonathan Broadbery, the director of policy at NDNA, said that nursery providers were “very conscious” of what a rise in nursery fees would mean, not just for parents but for the development of the children in their care, too. “Every nursery works to the early years foundation stage, and are providing educational opportunities and focusing on child development. Especially for disadvantaged children, being in early education is one of the most important things you can do to close the gap. Lower-income parents will be forced to withdraw their children, who have the most to gain from not being a year behind their peers when they start school.” Joeli Brearley, the chief executive and founder of the campaign Pregnant Then Screwed, said thousands of mothers were already struggling to get back to work because of childcare costs and availability of places – and thousands more could be pushed into the red if fees rose. “With costs due to rise, and even more childcare facilities set to close their doors, we are heading for a crisis among families with young children,” she said. “The government’s lack of investment in this sector is forcing parents, mainly mothers, out of work and into poverty.” Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, the director of the Women’s Budget Group, said that single parents – the majority of whom are women – would be most affected by any further rises in childcare costs. “We’ve heard plenty in recent weeks about how to get parents off benefits and into work, but very little about why that is so hard to do,” she added. “In its current form, parents on universal credit need to come up with hundreds of pounds in childcare fees before they’ve even gone out to work and earned a penny. A really simple thing that the government could do right now would be to start paying the childcare element of universal credit upfront instead of in arrears.” Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, believes that parents and providers both deserve more. “We would urge the government to support early years settings to meet the rising cost of operating, to ensure that settings remain financially viable and that vital early education and care remains affordable and accessible for the children and parents that need it,” he said. A government spokesperson said: “The early years of a child’s life are the most crucial, which is why we have invested more than £3.5bn in each of the last three years to deliver the free childcare offers, including the 30 hours a week for working parents. We are also investing millions in family hubs – where families can access important support services. “To support working families more widely, we also recently announced the biggest ever increase in the national living wage since its introduction from April 2022 and thanks to the action we’ve taken, unemployment continues to fall with more employees on payrolls than ever before.”",Lifestyle/Money,‘We’re heading for a crisis’: UK parents face rising fees as nursery costs soar,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/22/uk-parents-fees-nursery-costs-england
3/22/2022,"“How are you?” is a question – as I remember my mother telling me long ago – best avoided. Once you start to think about it, you realise most people prefer not to have to respond to the inquiry truthfully (a polite “fine” covers it). In Every Family Has a Story: How We Inherit Love and Loss, a collection of eight family narratives, psychotherapist Julia Samuel finds herself asking Archie, a man in his 50s with a brain tumour who has been told he has no more than a year to live, how he is, and he “gently” reminds her of her “insensitivity” – and she reproaches herself. What makes Samuel outstandingly sympathetic as a therapist and as a writer is her unusual willingness to admit to faultiness and not to be remote or over-authoritative. She is a virtuoso listener, but wears her heart on her sleeve and will occasionally admit to feeling unequal to what she is witnessing. Her lovely – and in no way insensitive – character leavens the narratives assembled here. Samuel’s books have been bestsellers partly because they are infused with hope. She could be described as a sanguine realist – even, or particularly, when the stories she tells are bleak. Her first book was Grief Works (2017), based on 25 years of working as a grief psychotherapist, and her insights about loss continue to serve her well. Her splendid second book, This Too Shall Pass (2020), was a natural extension of the first, focusing on how different sorts of change affect us, and offering a first-aid kit for the psyche as its conclusion. This third book is the most intrepid because Samuel’s training has not been in “family systems” (she judiciously includes a supervisor in the narrative). The focus is on the fascinating subject of how the “unresolved stressors of one generation can be passed down to intensify the daily pressures of life for the next”. It is well known that Samuel was born into the Guinness family and was a friend of Princess Diana’s, but what she chooses to disclose here is merely that her parents’ background was one of “great privilege and multiple traumas” – survived by the stiffest of upper lips. “The perfect brew to ferment a psychotherapist,” she adds lightly. The eight families have been carefully chosen. They are diverse in ethnicity, sexuality, economic circumstances and in the issues they raise: divorce, bereavement, same-sex marriage and adoption, addiction, empty nest syndrome. The effect is at times almost too schematic (was her publisher calling the shots?), but the Samuel magic continues to obtain. She shows that there is no family tree without its gnarled complexity. Families are “messy, chaotic and imperfect. Where we love and care most, we also hurt most…” She reminds us: “One of the snares of family is it is the only relationship we cannot leave, however much we might like to.” She describes how families have changed: “New families include single-parent families, stepfamilies, polyamorous families, extended families and blended families, made up of the couple, the children they have had together and those from their previous relationships.” The latest research is sobering: in the US, divorce among couples over 50 has doubled in the past 20 years, while 5% of siblings are said to be completely estranged and 23% barely speak to one another. And there is another arresting new finding: “We all worry more than previous generations, and particularly about our adult children.” My husband, who is Jewish, likes to tell a Jewish joke: “If you’re not worrying about anything – you should be worried…” Samuel writes brilliantly about worry in general and about parenting adult children in particular, and continuing to worry about them. It’s good to see her pointing out the tyranny of smartphones that update parents about “every small kink” and “feed a loop of anxiety”. I was glad to see her highlighting the paradox of “how to hold on to our children while letting them go”. She urges the ditching of expectations. She suggests that parents, if they are trusted by their adult children, have more influence than they might suppose. In a particularly moving chapter she meets the Bergers, an ultra-orthodox Jewish family, five generations presided over by Kati, a Holocaust survivor. She explores how trauma plays out, and is profoundly shocked by Kati’s story and impressed by the family. Worry itself can be an inheritance. From the start, Samuel emphasises that therapy need not be epic: “For someone using time as a barrier to seeking therapy I would suggest (with a smile) it takes less time than watching a TV series.” She reminds the reader, too, of the power of contrition. How long, after all, does it take to say sorry? Archie takes his adult children out separately to apologise for his shortcomings as a father, and each reports on the transformative effect on their relationship with him. Occasionally, Samuel’s elegant wrapping up of chapters – the hint of marshmallow without quite enough steel – encourages misgivings. Would more time have helped? Maybe there needed to be a garnish of hopelessness too – to convince. She concludes: “The difficult truth is that we can only fix what we can face.” I was waiting for her to add that there is an even more difficult truth: that not everything can be fixed. But Samuel is on the side of making life better, and, especially at this moment in human history, nothing could matter more.

3/22/2022,"Once a week, a train pulls out of Aberdeen station at 08.20 and heads south. There’s no great fanfare, no particular sense of occasion, and the train itself is only five coaches long. However, everything else about this service is Brobdingnagian. Over the next 13 hours and 19 minutes it travels 774 miles, the greatest distance covered by any train in Britain. Stopping at 35 stations along the way, it spends around two hours of the journey stationary as it picks up and drops off passengers. After proceeding down the east coast as far as Newcastle, it heads south to York, then trundles south-west across the Midlands and on to Bristol, finally making its way to Penzance on the western tip of Cornwall via the south coast of Devon. The full journey is always made in that direction – for maintenance reasons, no service goes all the way north. And having been suspended for nearly two years because of the pandemic, the service is up and running again – albeit only on Saturdays for the time being. Having made my way to Aberdeen on less Herculean trains, I strolled along the city’s sandy beach on a bright, crisp day to the rows of cottages that make up Footdee (pronounced “Fittie” locally), once a discrete fishing village. In Duthie Park’s free-to-enter David Welch Winter Gardens, the tropical house transported me to balmier climes. When evening came I ate at the lively Ninety-Nine Bar, whose current resident chefs – “how BAO now” – offer a good smattering of plant-based options, such as bao buns with smoky teriyaki tofu. Also, one of my cocktails was on fire – a sure sign that one is winning at life. Afterwards I headed around the corner to the refurbished Siberia Hotel (doubles from £52 a night room only) to wallow in my en suite whirlpool bath. It’s no wonder that, just before the pandemic struck, the Granite City leapt from 16th to eighth in the annual Bank of Scotland survey of Scotland’s best places to live. But as I left, I found myself wondering: what exactly do you do on a train journey that lasts as long as Star Wars Episodes I-VI ? Though the wifi was surprisingly good, I chose to devote the hours not to screen-gazing but scene-grazing. Before long, with a rising sun blazing across a mirror-flat North Sea, I had drifted off into a state approaching zen. I found myself charting the train’s progress in several ways. I noted numerous well-loved landmarks, beginning with a trio of venerable fortresses: Edinburgh Castle, whose elegant silhouette trumps many a capital’s skyline; Bamburgh Castle, sprawled confidently across a Northumbrian outcrop; and Durham, towering over the Wear and dominated by its impressive cathedral. There were lesser milestones to look out for as well, such as the mysterious ruined sandstone house halfway down the cliffs just north of Berwick-upon-Tweed – glimpsed for a few seconds, then gone. I also marked our passage by the rivers and estuaries we crossed. This route crosses a host of spectacular bridges, most of them bequeathed to us by the Victorians. In the first five hours we had been conveyed over the Tay, the Firth of Forth, the Tweed and the Tyne; towards the end, Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s magnificent Royal Albert Bridge bore us high over the Tamar into Cornwall. I became a contented observer of people’s lives: the joggers on a Birmingham towpath, the farmworker plodding across an enormous field, the group of boys fishing something out of a river that was certainly not a fish. I scanned the countryside for wildlife. A fox slunk warily back to its den. A pair of gulls engaged in an aerial dogfight with a flock of rooks. A geometric pattern of molehills revealed itself, created with the precision of a crop circle. Five roe deer, all striking precisely the same pose, watched the rattling, clattering carriages slide by. You can only get this snapshot of Britain from the vantage point of a train. For much of the summer you can make this journey entirely in daylight, although on my trip, the wintertide gloaming dwindled into night between Cheltenham and Bristol. After that, I pressed my face against the window to catch the beacon lights of remote farmhouses and the more gregarious illuminations of Exeter and Plymouth. Stepping out at Penzance I was immediately struck by how much milder it was than in Aberdeen. After a night in a former fisherman’s cottage in Newlyn, I went for a misty morning walk in a T-shirt, through the bumpy countryside just outside the town and down into the fishing village of Mousehole. That evening at The Vault, a swish pop-up restaurant in Penzance, I undid all my exercise with rich dishes of padron peppers, wild mushroom arancini and basil tagliatelle accompanied by glasses of Abruzzian trebbiano and Puglian primitivo (the pop-up owners hold a national Restaurant Wine List of the Year award). That night, having strolled along the coast back to my lodgings , I felt like I’d had two very different holidays in one. Or three really – as Agatha Christie once said: “To travel by train is to see nature and human beings, towns and churches and rivers, in fact, to see life.”  Train tickets were provided by CrossCountry (singles from Aberdeen to Penzance from £114). Accommodation at Kara Cottage, Newlyn, was provided by Luxury Cornish Escapes, from £100 a night (sleeps two, three-night minimum,. Hotel Siberia has doubles from £52. The Vault pop-up has moved into the reopened Old Coastguard in Mousehole. Further info from visitscotland.com This yomp across England takes in vast tracts of scenic and varied countryside. The journey begins beside the River Wensum and crosses rural plains to Thetford, before plunging across the Fens – nearly 1,500 square miles of marshy ground beneath wide-open skies. In early spring, keep your eyes peeled for flocks of wildfowl, such as wigeon, teal and shoveler as they start migrating north. Further on, the journey incorporates large swathes of the Peak District national park, passing through the gorgeous Vale of Edale as it heads west from Sheffield to Stockport. This is a route that loves a cathedral too. Bookended by one in Norwich and Liverpool’s pair, it stops at five further cathedral cities – Ely, Peterborough, Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester. Also look out for the famous crooked spire of St Mary and All Saints at Chesterfield – there’s a cracking view of it just south of the station. The cities at both ends of the route are on the up. England’s first Unesco City of Literature, Norwich enjoys a buzzy literary scene, with spoken word events and author talks at various venues including the National Writing Centre. Or you can just sit in little independent cafes like The Bicycle Shop and watch someone at the next table penning a genre-defying masterpiece. Liverpool, meanwhile, is teeming with offbeat events, from next month’s Liverpool Against Racism music day (24 April) to Sunday-morning brunches with live gospel music in Alma de Cuba, a former church. 254 miles, from five hours 38 minutes, hourly until mid-afternoon Mon-Sat (advance single from £32.50, eastmidlandsrailway.co.uk) A leisurely jaunt south-east from the vibrant Welsh capital to one of the south coast’s major cities. Before you leave Cardiff, try something different like an urban foraging course in Bute Park. Or keep the Winter Olympics flame burning by hitting the slopes at the Cardiff ski and snowboard centre, then cheering on the Cardiff Devils, one of the top ice hockey teams in Britain. At Newport, look to the left for the eye-catching art deco clock tower that has become a symbol for the town, and to the right as the train crosses the River Usk to see the castle towers right next to the railway bridge. After the four-mile Severn Tunnel – another extraordinary feat of Victorian engineering – highlights include a saunter through the Georgian spa town of Bath; a long, scenic stretch beside the River Avon, passing under the graceful Dundas Aqueduct; a foray through Bradford on Avon, founded by the Romans and encircled by Green Belt; and a trundle along the Wylye Valley beneath the southern edge of Salisbury Plain. Journey’s end comes at Portsmouth, which is better known for the Spinnaker Tower and historic dockyard than its winter sports, but that hasn’t stopped the renowned Banff Mountain film festival from pitching camp at the Kings Theatre for a night on 27 April on its world tour. 135 miles, around three hours 16 minutes, hourly throughout the day (advance single from £27.90, gwr.com) This is a train whose route is as mysterious and sublime as the scenery through which it travels. Though it’s easy to see the logic of running a direct service from Manchester as far as Swansea, this one simply keeps going, pushing west along the south Wales coast for nearly two more hours, even taking in a few request stops before finally running out of steam at Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire. After Cheshire’s comfortable greensward, there’s a visit to Shrewsbury followed by a canter through some of Shropshire’s most beguiling countryside with the heights of the Long Mynd to one side and Wenlock Edge to the other. After Ludlow – a town with nearly 500 listed buildings dating back to the middle ages – the line follows the River Lugg and its tributaries through Leominster to Hereford before crossing the border into Wales just south-east of the Black Mountains. Next stop is Abergavenny before the train swings west to make its way along the south coast. It would be an exaggeration to say that Milford Haven is packed with attractions, beyond its maritime-themed museum. However, by exploring other Pembrokeshire branch lines you can visit the pleasingly old-fashioned seaside town of Tenby, the well-preserved castles at Pembroke and Manorbier, or Fishguard, whose lively annual folk festival ( 27-29 May) is mostly free. 285 miles, from six hours five minutes, every two hours until late afternoon (advance single from £33.50, tfwrail.wales) Direct trains between Glasgow and Newcastle are swift and reasonably frequent, taking passengers via Edinburgh and the Northumbrian coastline and stopping at five or six stations on the way. However, there is a much less-well-advertised southern route between the two cities. Every day except Sundays, the 16.11 pulls out from Glasgow Central and heads for Carlisle before cutting across country to reach Tyneside. Although this is a slightly shorter route, the train takes over an hour longer to reach the same destination. Calling at 21 stations en route, it’s an offering to warm the heart of slow travel fans everywhere. Add to that the spectacular scenery through which it travels and it becomes a true collector’s item for any railway lover. The train slides along Nithsdale into Dumfries before crossing the border at Gretna. After leaving Carlisle it runs just south of Hadrian’s Wall all the way across the country, offering passengers tremendous views of untamed Cumbrian and Northumbrian countryside (though not of the wall itself). Newcastle is full of insufficiently heralded gems, such as The Biscuit Factory, which is the UK’s largest independent art gallery and free to enter. Early bird tickets are now on sale for the city’s biggest music festival, This is Tomorrow, which returns on 3-5 June this year with headliners to be announced soon. In Glasgow, A Play, A Pie and A Pint kicks off another at the Òran Mór bar with the curtain going up on 35 new plays and musicals – a fresh one every week for most of the year. 164 miles, three hours 56 minutes (four hours three minutes on Saturdays), once daily from Monday to Saturday off-peak single £77.10, scotrail.co.uk.

3/22/2022,"The right wing in America has spent the past 18 months waging an increasingly vocal war on education, banning books and restricting the discussions teachers can have in classrooms, usually when it comes to issues like racism or sexuality. That could be starting to change, however, as progressives have won a series of victories in some states, suggesting a backlash against education censorship could be on the way. So far in 2022 the left has forced Republicans in Indiana to abandon legislation that would have placed severe restrictions on what teachers can say in classrooms, while in New Hampshire liberal candidates won sweeping victories against conservative “anti-critical race theory” candidates in school board elections. Critical race theory is an academic discipline that examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society, but it has become a catch-all buzzword on the right. The progressive wins are a development that looked unlikely as the right wing, often through organizations with connections to wealthy Republican donors, has introduced bill after bill in states across the country. The campaign has successfully banned books, predominantly pertaining to issues of race or sexuality, from school districts, while some states have already banned discussion of the modern-day impact of historical racism in the US. In Indiana, education advocates celebrated in late February after HB1134, a bill which the Indianapolis Star reported would have restricted how teachers could discuss racial inequality and sexual orientation, was defeated. The bill had passed the Indiana house in January, but amid concerted protests led by the Indiana State Teachers Association the legislation was watered down before it made it to the Republican-controlled senate, which ultimately said it did not have the votes to pass the bill. “Every day we had folks that came to Indianapolis,” said Keith Gambill, president of ISTA. “I think it was just that constant drumbeat from our organization and the other organizations that stood in solidarity with us that made the difference.” It helped that the Indiana senate had previously torpedoed its own version of the house legislation. In early January one Republican senator said teachers “need to be impartial” when discussing subjects including nazism and fascism, prompting national headlines and widespread backlash. The death of HB1134 was an important victory for Indiana teachers, but Gambill said there had still been consequences. “What we are finding both in the state of Indiana and nationally is that we are losing educators at an alarming rate. “Some of that certainly is on pay, but that’s not the only thing that is driving the exodus. When you have bills such as this that continue to just be this wedge issue, invading your workspace, folks start looking around saying: ‘These other companies are hiring and I have all of the qualifications.’” The Indiana legislation mirrored rightwing efforts in other states to drive honest discussion of race and sexuality from classrooms. PEN America, a non-profit organization that works to protect freedom of expression, said 155 bills that would censor what teachers can say or teach in classrooms were introduced in 38 states in 2021, while 2022 has seen a “steep rise” in the introduction of what PEN America calls “gag orders”. In Florida a “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which would ban discussion of sexuality and gender identity in schools, is expected to be signed into law by Ron DeSantis, the state’s governor. The bill would allow parents to file lawsuits against school boards if they believe policies violate the law. A bill being considered in Kansas would change the state’s obscenity law, making it a class B misdemeanor for a teacher to use any material which depicts “homosexuality” in a classroom, while looming legislation in Arizona would allow parents to sue teachers and school districts for perceived violations of parental rights. While the right wing has rallied around the issue of classroom censorship, there is little evidence that a majority of parents are demanding a crackdown on what their children can read, or be taught. In February a CNN poll found that only 12% of Americans believed parents “should have the most sway over which library books are on the shelves and how American history is taught”. Far from there being a popular uprising against what teachers are imparting to students, the censorship efforts have frequently been pushed by conservative groups with ties to deep-pocketed rightwing donors. Groups like Moms for Liberty and Parents Defending Education have been instrumental in book banning attempts in the US, often presenting themselves as small, “grassroots” efforts, while in reality they have links to prominent, wealthy Republicans. Those groups have had success in several states by packing school boards, which have substantial say over what can be taught in schools, but there are signs that a shift may be coming. In New Hampshire, teaching advocates celebrated a big win in March after progressive candidates swept to victory in school board elections around the state. Granite State Progress backed 30 candidates in the elections, with 29 of those successful, some in traditionally conservative districts. Zandra Rice Hawkins, the group’s executive director, said the group had been inundated with calls from organizations and school board candidates around the country who are keen to replicate the success. She is hopeful that there could be further victories, and a rejection of the right wing’s draconian censorship efforts, to come. “We think that what happened here in New Hampshire is a sign of things to come across our state and across the nation,” Rice Hawkins said. “Public education is a bedrock of democracy, and so many people are aware of that and I think the things that are happening now, talks of banning books and other things like that, that’s got a lot of people paying attention, and frankly this GOP strategy of trying to drive a wedge between parents and communities and their public schools is going to backfire in a major way.”",News/Education,Progressives are resisting rightwing book banning campaigns – and are winning,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/22/educators-resisting-rightwing-book-banning
3/22/2022,"The carbon footprint of imported flowers can be 10 times that of a homegrown bouquet, so it pays to “buy small and buy British”. That was one of the conclusions of a Lancaster University study in 2018 that looked at the environmental impact of British, Dutch and Kenyan cut flowers. The research conducted by Becky Swinn looked at the carbon emissions relating to cultivation and transportation, plus other key issues such as fertiliser and water use. She concluded that the emissions from Dutch and Kenyan flowers were broadly equal, with the Dutch flowers using a lot more artificial heating and lighting, while the Kenyan emissions came mainly from transportation. Overall, she found that an imported mixed bouquet produced 10 times greater carbon emissions than a seasonally grown British one. Friends of the Earth says that if you really want cut flowers, try to source some that are locally produced and grown without pesticides if possible. Alternatively, consider planning ahead and growing your own. Flowers sold in supermarkets and other outlets will often state whether they were grown in the UK. If you do go for imported flowers – and some will want to support farmers and workers in countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia – you may want to choose Fairtrade ones. Fairtrade-certified farms receive a premium of 10% for every stem sold, which allows workers to invest in healthcare, education and other benefits. The Fairtrade website lists stockists; they include Aldi, Asda, the Co-op, Lidl and Marks & Spencer. There are other schemes to look out for, too, such as the Florverde Sustainable Flowers certification programme. Sending flowers can involve a lot of waste, so you may want to look for a certified carbon neutral florist, such as Bloom & Wild, or one that offers a plastic-free range, such as Bunches. “We are working towards having zero plastics in all our deliveries,” says Dani Turner at Bunches. “We haven’t got there yet because that’s a real journey to go on with suppliers but our letterbox range is entirely plastic-free.” Prices start at £24 for 15 pink and cream carnations, surrounded by pink gypsophila, with free delivery. Bunches says it also donates a minimum of 10% of its profits to charitable projects in the UK and abroad. The company sources its flowers from all over the world. Although this approach is often criticised as unsustainable, Turner argues that the company is providing employment for growers in developing countries such as Colombia, where she says the flower industry is helping farm workers and their families to have access to healthcare and education. She also claims that from an emissions perspective it can be better to grow a carnation in Colombia and fly it to Britain than grow it here using electricity. Friends of the Earth says that with cut flowers, the four issues for it are carbon footprint, pesticide use, land and water use, and unsustainable and unrecyclable materials used to display and package them.",Lifestyle/Money,How UK shoppers can buy beautifully ethical flowers,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/22/how-buy-flowers-beautifully-ethical-uk-carbon-plastic-delivery

3/22/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray with you again; here are the stories that matter right now. Russia’s false accusation that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons shows Vladimir Putin has his “back is against the wall” and is considering using them himself, Joe Biden has said. Biden said it was “simply not true, I guarantee you” that the US possessed such weapons in Europe. He said the Kremlin was making similar accusations against Ukraine: “[Putin has] already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful of what’s about to come.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has again urged direct talks with Putin: “Without this meeting it is impossible to fully understand what they are ready for in order to stop the war.” He also said his country would never bow to ultimatums from Russia; cities directly under attack, including the capital, Kyiv, and Mariupol and Kharkiv would not accept Russian occupation. Almost 10,000 Russian soldiers may have already been killed in the war in Ukraine, and more than 16,000 wounded, according to purported Russian defence ministry figures posted by a pro-Kremlin tabloid newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. The paper later took down the figures and said it had been hacked. Russia’s invasion has largely stalled, failing to capture any major city, but causing massive destruction to residential areas: a total of 925 civilians have been killed and 1,496 injured, according to the UN Human Rights office.

Ex-minister takes second job – The Conservative MP and former social care minister Caroline Dinenage has signed up for a second job as a director for a care home developer, just months after Boris Johnson promised a crackdown on outside earnings. Dinenage asked for formal approval for a non-executive job at LNT Group, owned by the Tory donor Lawrence Tomlinson. The government has quietly dropped support for capping outside hours and earnings by MPs. Despite the lack of formal new rules, many MPs have cut back their work for private companies. At least 20 Conservative MPs have lobbied the standards committee with many saying they strongly disagreed with time limits on outside work. Dinenage has been contacted for comment. Russian asset tracker – More than $17bn (£13bn) of global assets – including offshore bank accounts, yachts, private jets and luxury properties in London, Tuscany and the French Riviera – have been linked to 35 oligarchs and Russian officials alleged to have close ties to Vladimir Putin. The Guardian, working in partnership with the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and other international news organisations, is unveiling the initial research in an ongoing project to track the wealth of Russia’s most powerful operators. The Russian asset tracker project will start by focusing on a list of 35 men and women named last year as Putin’s alleged enablers by the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. It will record assets outside Russia where the reporting partners have seen evidence connecting them to these individuals. The tracker has identified UK properties or plots of land – collectively worth more than half a billion dollars – that are linked through companies, trusts or relatives to four leading figures on Navalny’s list: Roman Abramovich, Alisher Usmanov, Oleg Deripaska and Igor Shuvalov. The Guardian is reporting further on these findings over the coming days. Ethnic bias in car cover? – Hundreds of thousands of people of colour may be paying an “ethnicity penalty” of at least £280 and up to £950 a year in car insurance costs, Citizens Advice has claimed. An investigation carried out 649 insurance mystery shops, comparing areas with a high white population with those with a high proportion of people of colour. It also analysed 18,000 car insurance bills from users of its debt help service. In some areas “the difference in price was more than 100%” and risk factors such as crime rates and deprivation levels could not account for this. James Dalton from the Association of British Insurers said its members complied with the Equality Act. “There are many different risk-related factors that are used to calculate the price … but ethnicity is not one of them.” ‘Not a ransom, a debt owed’ – The UK government knew for years that if it paid a £400m debt to Iran it was likely to lead to the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the former Foreign Office minister, Alistair Burt, has said. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 43, at a press conference on Monday asked why it had taken five foreign secretaries and six years to secure her release. Zaghari-Ratcliffe said: “We all know … how I came home. It should have happened exactly six years ago. I should not have been in prison for six years.” She urged an end to the detention of other dual nationals still held in Iran, saying that without their release “the meaning of freedom is never going to be complete”. Eat less crap – Gordon Ramsay has said the Covid-19 pandemic wiped the slate clean of “crap” restaurants. In a Radio Times interview, the celebrity chef said he meant “shitholes in a prime position and taking advantage because they’re in a great location, and they’ve got the footfall.” As well as independent businesses, hundreds of restaurant chains have closed branches including Carluccio’s, Byron Burger, Frankie & Benny’s, Pizza Express and more. Ramsay said: “Customers have got so much smarter in the last two years. They know a lot more about food than they ever have done and have been making their own sourdough … It’s wiped the arrogance from the industry.” Bird’s eye on history – Historic England is launching an aerial photography tool that allows users to explore images of England over the past century. The bird’s eye views range from second world war defences and nuclear power stations to the remains of neolithic monuments, Roman farmsteads and medieval villages. More than 400,000 photographs from 1919 to the present day, covering 30% of England, will be available to search and view online for the first time.

At first I felt a little dirty, a little shameful. Everyone is in these spaces for one reason: to make money. “Soon, though, my shame started to interest me. I thumbed through channels on the subway or in bed late at night …” Not all cryptocurrency investors fit the cliches.

Sebastian Coe has claimed that the “integrity and future of women’s sport” is at stake after the American swimmer Lia Thomas became the first transgender woman to win an NCAA swimming championship last week. Liverpool and Manchester City fans have united in their condemnation of the “shambolic” travel arrangements for their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley next month.
