1/6/2022,"Good morning, I’m Virginia Harrison and here are our top stories this Thursday.  An extraordinary battle has broken out at the Australian border after tennis star Novak Djokovic was denied entry to the country for failing to meet strict Covid vaccination rules. The world No 1, who was due to play in the Australian Open, has launched a court battle amid a spiralling outcry over a controversial “medical exemption” agreed by the tournament’s organisers. The Serbian player is awaiting his fate in a Melbourne quarantine hotel as he mounts a legal challenge against Australia’s decision to cancel his visa. The move has sparked diplomatic fallout, with Serbia’s president Aleksandar Vučić accusing Australia of “maltreatment”. “I told our Novak that the whole of Serbia is with him and that our bodies are doing everything to see that the harassment of the world’s best tennis player is brought to an end immediately,” he said in a statement. The star’s father, Srdjan, had strong words for the world, telling Russian media: “Tonight they can throw him in a dungeon, tomorrow they can put him in chains. The truth is he is like water and water paves its own path. Novak is the Spartacus of the new world which won’t tolerate injustice, colonialism and hypocrisy.” The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, dismissed pleas to reconsider the move, saying “rules are rules, and there are no special cases.” He added: “People are welcome in Australia, but if they’re not double vaccinated and not an Australian resident, you can’t come.” Djokovic, who is no stranger to controversy and bad behaviour, has become something of a flashpoint among the Australian public over the sense that different sets of rules apply to powerful or famous people.

Covid staffing crisis – Millions of patients will suffer worsening quality of care unless ministers take immediate action to alleviate the staffing crisis engulfing the NHS, health chiefs have warned. The NHS Confederation, which represents the whole healthcare system, has called for a range of new measures to be implemented in the NHS in England to help overstretched hospitals and struggling ambulance, mental health, community, GP and social care services cope with “widespread” shortages of medics and health workers. The measures include deploying tens of thousands of medical students on to wards and other healthcare settings, priority access for NHS and social care staff to lateral flow and PCR tests and a review of self-isolation periods to see if it can be slashed from 10 days to five. The warning is the latest in a deepening staffing crisis across the healthcare system driven by the Omicron wave.

Colston Four – Anti-racism campaigners have hailed a jury’s decision to clear protesters responsible for toppling a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston as a huge step in getting the UK to face up to its colonial past. As Rajeev Syal writes, the acquittal of the Colston Four will prompt close scrutiny of the actions of the home secretary, Priti Patel, who became personally involved in ensuring that they were pursued through the criminal justice system. Hours after the statue of the slave trader was toppled on 7 June 2020, Patel appeared on Sky News to demand that police pursue those responsible, saying their behaviour was “utterly disgraceful”. Two days later, it emerged that she had also called Andy Marsh, the chief constable of Avon and Somerset police, to demand an explanation. Nazir Afzal, the former chief prosecutor for north-west England, told the Guardian: “We have a tripartite regime for a reason and that is so that politicians do not get involved in the operational decisions taken by the police. It may be that she has overstepped the boundaries of that arrangement.” As of Wednesday night, Patel had not released a statement commenting on the trial verdict. The acquittal is the latest in a series of cases in which juries have cleared protesters despite there being no question of their having carried out the actions for which they were tried. Here are some other recent examples. Cost of living - Jacob Rees-Mogg asked Rishi Sunak to reconsider impending tax rises as the chancellor and the prime minister came under sustained fire from Conservative MPs to tackle rising costs of living. Ministers are examining further targeted measures to mitigate soaring energy costs for vulnerable households including potentially extending the warm homes discount – but are set to reject a VAT cut. During a cabinet debate on Wednesday, Rees-Mogg is understood to have suggested the chancellor ditch the impending 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance to ease the squeeze. ‘No more talk’ – One of the only black female QCs in England and Wales has said the time has come for action on tackling race inequality in the legal profession. Barbara Mills, who is co-chair of the Bar Council’s race working group, said the next 12 months would be “critical” to tackling systemic obstacles at the bar. A landmark Race at the Bar report found there were just five black female QCs – senior barristers, also known as silks – in England and Wales (another two were announced last month). Another stark statistic: a black female junior barrister with the same level of experience as a white male junior billed £18,700 a year less on average, and an Asian woman £16,400 less. Mills said: “… [what] our brown and black colleagues are expecting is a sense, a feeling of visibility, that it’s changing – no more talk, just change it.” ‘I kept saying – don’t worry Luma, we see you’ – Oscar-winning director Andrea Arnold has revealed what four years spent filming a cow taught her about life. Her new documentary, Cow, explores warmth, joy and anger through the eyes of a farmyard animal, and consists of 94 minutes of moos, with the odd off-camera interjection from farmhands.

Mishcon de Reya, one of the UK’s most prestigious law firms, has been fined a record amount for committing “serious breaches” of money-laundering rules. The London-based firm has agreed to pay a fine of £232,500, plus a further £50,000 towards the costs of the investigation, which was carried out by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA).

The Colston four dominate today’s front pages, with plenty of space also given to Covid and the Djokovic deportation saga. The Guardian leads with “Four cleared over toppling of Edward Colston statue” while the Telegraph has “‘Colston four’ walk free as jury says no crime was committed”. The Daily Express’s take is “Statue ‘vandals’ cleared … but where will it all end?” The Times has “Bristol jury clears protestors who toppled Edward Colston statue” above a report on “Boost for holidays as travel tests scrapped”, saying families to save £300 to avoid quarantine. The i newspaper leads with “Deported”, alongside a picture of an angry Djokovic, saying the world No 1 tennis player was told he will be removed from Australia in a visa row over his refusal to be vaccinated. The Daily Mail also runs a picture of Djokovic, saying the “anti-vaccine tennis star” is to be “kicked out of Australia”, while its splash is “We have lift-off, Britain!” on the scrapping of almost all testing rules on foreign travel. Covid also features in the Mirror, with “Perfect storm” – reporting on the NHS front line. The paper says the NHS is facing a crisis with soaring staff absences and a huge rise in Covid patients.

1/6/2022,"British consumers spent a record figure of almost £10bn on home entertainment last year as the pandemic continued to fuel a boom in streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify. That included a “miracle” increase in revenues from sales of physical music formats after two decades of seemingly inexorable decline, helped by fans starved of live gigs spending their extra cash on vinyl.  Overall spending on entertainment, which covers digital and physical video, music and gaming – including sales of CDs, DVDs and video games – increased by 4.6% last year to £9.7bn. The figures, which were inflated by the growth of streaming TV and music subscription services, defied expectations of a decline after entertainment spending in 2020 grew at the fastest rate in a quarter of a century. James Bond: No Time to Die was the bestselling video content of the year, with Bond fans snapping up three times as many copies as the next most popular entry. The latest edition of football title Fifa once again topped the video games charts, while Adele’s 30 was the most popular album. “The entire sector was braced for revenues to settle down in 2021 after 2020 grew an astonishing 18.7%, but growth has continued for the ninth successive year,” said Kim Bayley, the chief executive of the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA), which publishes the annual report. “The vast majority of the growth is being driven by digital services making entertainment more accessible and convenient than ever before.” The figures highlight the scale of the dramatic shift towards internet-based services, from subscribing to a service such as Netflix or Spotify to buying or renting a game, film or box set from Sky Store or Apple’s iTunes, with almost 90% of total entertainment spend now on digital services. Total digital revenues grew by 8.3% to £8.66bn, more than the entire market was worth just two years ago. By comparison, overall physical revenues declined 18.5% to just over £1bn. However, the ERA said that within this decline music fans delivered a “miracle”, with sales of physical music showing growth for the first time since 2001. Sales of physical music grew 7.3% to £291.5m thanks to the continuing boom in the popularity of vinyl, which was given an additional boost by fans spending their cash on stocking their music collections because of the lack of gigs and concerts. Revenues from vinyl album sales rose 23% to £135.6m, while CD sales continued to fall 3.9% to £150m. “The return of physical music sales to growth a full two decades since they started to decline is nothing short of a miracle,” said Bayley. However, the music sector remains dominated by digital with income from subscriptions to services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music climbing 11% to £1.3bn. This was more than the entire value of the UK recorded music industry as recently as 2018 and accounted for 80% of the total £1.67bn. Adele produced the most popular album of the year with total sales of 600,000, ahead of Ed Sheeran’s =, which sold 432,000 copies. In the video market, spending on subscription streaming services, led by Netflix, Amazon’s Prime Video and Disney+, grew by 28% year on year to £3.16bn. Overall, digital revenues accounted for 93% of the total £3.75bn video market, which grew by 13% in 2021. However, a lack of blockbuster releases in cinemas last year dramatically affected income from subsequent DVD sales as well as digital ownership and rentals from services such as Apple’s iTunes and Sky Store. Overall revenues from DVD sales fell 40% to £150m, while Blu-ray Disc income decline by a fifth to £85.7m and digital rental and ownership fell 28% to £336m. Nevertheless, Bondmania fuelled 1.1m sales of No Time To Die, including renting and buying or downloading a copy physically or digitally, more than the rest of the top five bestsellers combined. “The reopening of cinemas and significant backlog of Hollywood blockbusters means we can expect renewed growth in ownership formats this year,” said Bayley. In gaming, which was the largest sector in the entertainment industry at £4.28bn, revenues fell 3.3% in 2021, having hit an all-time sales record in 2020 having grown by 18%. The ERA said a key factor in the dip was also the global shortage of semiconductors, which had hampered gamers getting their hands on the latest PlayStation and Xbox consoles. The only segment to show growth last year was mobile and tablet gaming, which grew 8% year on year to £1.5bn. Fifa 22, the bestselling game of the year, sold 917,000 physical units and another 1.3m in digital format.",News/Media,UK spends a record £9.7bn on home entertainment in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/06/uk-spends-record-pound-97bn-on-home-entertainment-in-2021
1/6/2022,"An intimate and unique snapshot of a nation reeling from the aftermath of the first world war was made available to the public on Thursday as the National Archives’ 1921 Census of England and Wales went online. The unprecedented glimpse into life 100 years ago reveals the very personal impact of the economic turmoil, housing crisis and major social changes caused by the war and the Spanish flu pandemic, capturing the desperation, anger and sadness of the 38 million individuals who filled in the form.  It also reveals a very British sense of subversion and humour: for the first time, the Census asked the occupation of every member of the household. With her tongue firmly in her cheek, Constance Bernard Fitzhamon of Middlesex, listed her three young children’s occupations as “Getting into mischief”, “Getting into more mischief” and, for her 11-month old child, as “occupying feeding bottles”. Despite being an official document whose purpose was to collate dry statistics, the Census glitters with emotional gems: John Platt’s son was born in Monmouthshire, Wales, on the very night the Census was filled out: “Baby Boy Platt” was proudly listed by his father as being just two hours old on the form, too young to even have a name. On the same day, also in Monmouthshire, a baby girl born appears to have been named literally as the Census was filled out. Martha Wall initially recorded her newborn baby as “Baby one day old” before crossing it out and adding the name Rose. Census enumerators, local officials who often knew the families, sometimes added extra details to the forms. William Hamilton of Newcastle upon Tyne mysteriously noted that he had a private income. The enumerator added – even more mysteriously – “Never worked. Enjoys Father’s Egyptian Pension”. The British love of animals – or perhaps the national fondness for mild subversion – is evident in the many families who listed family pets among their household members, including “Bobby the Dog” and “Tarzan the Cat”. “The census enumerators rarely had a sense of humour about these entries and struck them out,” said David Olusoga, professor of public history at the University of Manchester. Francis Sutcliffe of Kirkdale, Lancashire, for example, had her entry for “Kitty the Cat” crossed out with the curt explanation that Kitty was merely: “A domestic cat”. Mary McKee, head of content publishing operations at Findmypast, said they had expected humour and gentle sabotage of a document that was, after all, onerous to complete. “But what we hadn’t expected was the bureaucratic graffiti,” she said. “People were angry that they had been promised a postwar ‘land fit for heroes’ by the government but were, instead, experiencing mass unemployment and poor housing.” Many people used the form to protest: “David Lloyd George, build houses”,instructed Henry Burrough in Durham in a large note added to the form. “Lloyd George is hereby requested to bring forth that ‘Land fit for heroes’,” he added. “Nation’s duty to provide houses.” James Eldon Haynes in Yorkshire agreed. “Out of Work in the Land Fit for Heroes,”he wrote. Robert Stevens in Liverpool, who was out of work and had 12 children, wrote: “Please help me. Times are hard.” “It’s fascinating to see how many people subverted the Census and used it as a means of protesting to those in power,” said Olusoga. “This use of the Census reminds me of the way people now use Twitter.” The way the Census had to be filled out unpeeled other intimate details: it had to be completed on 19 June before midnight. On that night, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle, appeared to be holding a seance. “The Census shows he was playing host to a number of mystics and psychics that evening,” said McKee. “A seance seems the logical explanation of that gathering.” Other hidden treasures were discovered during the three years of intensive conservation and digitisation devoted to the Census. A dead menagerie of insects were found within its pages: 532 historic insects from a century ago. “I don’t know what’s been done with them,” said Olusoga. “I like to think a specialist conservationist has whisked them away to start a dead zoo.”",News/UK news,1921 Census of England and Wales reveals nation reeling from war,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/1921-census-of-england-and-wales-reveals-nation-reeling-from-war
1/6/2022,"Ruby will never forget the first time she clicked on the database AnonIB. It is a so-called “revenge porn” site and in January 2020, a friend had texted her for help. Ruby is a secondary school teacher, used to supporting teenagers, and her friend turned to her for advice when she discovered her images were on the site. “She didn’t send the thread that she was on,” says Ruby, 29. “She was embarrassed, so she sent a general link to the site itself.” When Ruby opened it, “I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I couldn’t believe that such an infrastructure existed: something so well organised, so systematic, fed by the people who lived around us.”  AnonIB was categorised by country – the US has the most entries, the UK is next – but then broken down by region, city and local area. “And when I say ‘local’, it wouldn’t be ‘London’ or ‘Birmingham’, a city of any size would have smaller, specific categories, like ‘Birmingham University students’,” says Ruby. The thread for Ruby’s town (population 55,000) stretched to 16 pages and with each intimate image of women and girls, there were comments with as much identifying information as possible by local users – names, surnames, the schools they had attended, who their relatives were. There were also lots of “requests” for pictures of certain women – often called “wins” (“Any wins on XXXX?” “There must be more of this slut out there.” “I can now look her boyfriend in the eye knowing I’ve seen his missus naked.”) Ruby was horrified. “I was in shock. Disgusted that it existed, but also confused,” she says. “How could it be allowed?” But worse was to come. Four months later, she found her own pictures had been added to the site. AnonIB has used various names over the last few years – always some kind of variation of “image board” and “anonymous”. It was shut down by Dutch police, but has since reappeared and is currently hosted from a Russian domain. In the past few months, it has gone behind a paywall. Yet the site is not a one-off. It is just one example of what a report last month by the Revenge Porn Helpline (RPH) has termed “collector culture” – something the RPH identifies as “an emerging trend”, “increasing at pace”. In this case, collecting means posting, collating and trading intimate images of women. “It’s one of the most dehumanising aspects of intimate image abuse that we see,” says Zara Roddis, senior helpline practitioner at RPH. “Women are prizes to be passed around, shared and traded like a dystopian version of Pokémon. We often don’t know how these people gained the images in the first place – it could be exes, friends, or hackers – but this isn’t a place where women would consensually upload themselves. All we see on the comments is women consistently and aggressively objectified, humiliated and exposed.” This happens on multiple platforms: Mega, Dropbox, Discord, anywhere groups can share. On Reddit, anonymous users post images of (likely oblivious) women with captions such as “trading my gf nudes” and “trading gf. Have bj videos too”. Interested parties are then usually directed to personal accounts on Snapchat or the messaging app Kik. Although it is impossible to know how common this is, the evidence suggests it’s widespread. (When Ruby was added to the AnonIB thread in May 2020, she was image number 72,000.) One general study of intimate image abuse across Australia, New Zealand and the UK suggests one in five men have been perpetrators, and during lockdown – when online activity replaced real-life interactions – calls to the RPH doubled. (Its figures show that women are five times more likely than men to have their intimate images shared.) “Traditionally, we think of ‘revenge porn’ as someone posting your images on Pornhub and sending you the link, or sending pictures and videos to all your friends and family to hurt and humiliate you,” says Elena Michael from the campaigning group #NotYourPorn. And, in fact, this is what current law nominally protects against. Section 33 of the 2015 Criminal Justice and Courts Act makes it illegal to disclose “private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress”. Yet, says Michael, that is only one form of such abuse. “The truth is that most intimate image abuse is clandestine. It’s done without consent, but also, often, with no intention of the survivor ever finding out.” Sophie Compton, who also campaigns against intimate image abuse with the organisation My Image My Choice believes “collector culture” could make up the bulk of cases. “I’ve been talking to survivors for 18 months and it’s huge – maybe more prevalent than any other form,” she says. “I’ve looked at the sites and the forums and the casual misogyny, the vile language, is absolutely chilling. The posters genuinely aren’t seeing victims as human, just stocks and shares to be traded. They could be anyone and everyone – and on sites like AnonIB which categorise by location, it could be the person standing next to you in Sainsbury’s.” Clare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University, says this is the “hardest message”. “People would rather think perpetrators of intimate image abuse are either perverts or an extremely malicious ‘other’ type of person,” she says. “The truth is that it’s everyday men and boys. Closed groups, lad chats, bonding over explicit images and ‘banter’ has become absolutely ubiquitous.” Sometimes, it leaks out and the wider world gets a glimpse. McGlynn points to the rugby group at Oxford Brookes University that challenged players to get as many “Brookes girl” nudes as possible to share and rate. There is the “men-only” private Bristol Facebook group set up to share images of partners and ex-partners that gained 7,000 members in a matter of days. Professor Nicola Henry, socio-legal scholar at RMIT University Australia, has studied the motives of perpetrators, looking at 77 platforms, image boards, community forums and blogging sites where images are shared and traded, and interviewed perpetrators. “Despite a lot of media attention focused on revenge against an ex-partner as the key motivation, it’s more commonly related to sexual gratification or impressing online peers,” she says. “For instance, on some sites, images of wives and girlfriends are shared to get positive feedback from other users.” (“It might have been a bit of showing off,” said one perpetrator she interviewed. “After I’d built up quite a collection, I started to kind of take this pride in it,” said another.) Whatever the motivation, the impact can be devastating. Ruby learned that her images were on AnonIB when a former schoolmate sent her a message breaking the news. The pictures were taken when she was 17, on a girls’ holiday. In one, she had been sunburned, and was lying topless on her front while a friend rubbed aftersun on her back. In the other, she was demonstrating the size of the hotel towels, not big enough to cover her. “On the scale of things, they were not that explicit – although in the context of that website, they looked suggestive,” she says. “I’d uploaded them for about three weeks after the holiday in a private Facebook album. I probably had about 400 Facebook friends at the time so whoever posted them was one of those people. I’ve resigned myself to never knowing who.”But as a local teacher, she had to inform her employer; she has no idea if her students have seen the pictures. And in the immediate aftermath, she found herself bolting from a post office queue simply because the teenagers outside suddenly made her feel uncomfortable. She formed a WhatsApp group for other local victims from the thread; in her small town, news travels fast and friends share their stories. “It has been far worse for some of them,” she says. “Their images were often far more explicit. Some haven’t been able to tell family or friends. Some were pregnant and so distressed they had to make emergency visits to hospital. “One girl wanted to pursue a career in the performing arts but she has put it off. She deferred her place at drama school because in that industry, image is everything. She didn’t know if she could cope with the anxiety of being Googled.” For Helen, 28, it feels as if she is an entirely different person from the one she was before her intimate images were shared in an encrypted chatroom. This spring, she received an anonymous “tipoff” on her Facebook account that explicit pictures of her had been gathered in a Google Drive folder and posted online. The informer – who was later traced to Australia – attached some of the pictures and said they thought she would like to know. She remembers collapsing on to her bed in shock; going for a run, dropping to the ground to cry, running again, then dropping again. The images in the message had been created in the course of a five-year relationship that had ended two years previously. “My ex had assured me they’d all been deleted,” says Helen. “We’d been speaking as friends right up until weeks before this happened. I had no reason to think he’d ever do that.” More than 18 months on, she still struggles. “I’m single,” she says, “and dating is really tough. I used to be open, confident, proud of my sexuality. It has damaged something I loved about myself, made it something I have to fight for again. “I have moments of shame I can’t control, moments when this fear arises that I can’t predict. I’ve had times when flirting with someone suddenly seems to cross a boundary I can’t understand. I’ve largely avoided intimacy as it’s too terrifying to really give that trust to another person.” Helen has tried to find out as little as possible about what was posted and where. “I’ve kind of chosen not to know,” she says. “It could be a lot. I was with that person a long time.” Her ex-partner was interviewed by police and also sent her a message admitting to sharing the images, but adding he had “never meant to hurt her”. He said he did it for his own “kink”.“As painful as it was to have it confirmed, I was happy that at least I had a confession the police could use,” she says. “Then it transpired that his claim of not wanting to hurt me was precisely what protected him from any prosecution.” Ruby and the other victims in the WhatsApp group from her local town have also found no recourse in law. She reported her case to police who gave her a crime reference number and referred her to Victim Support. Others in her group heard nothing back. In one case, one woman said, the officer actually yawned and said it was the 20th AnonIB report of the day. It took a lot of collective pressure for their cases to be referred as cybercrime to the Regional Organised Crime Unit. There has been no update since. “We really felt the police didn’t support us, but the law doesn’t support the police,” says Ruby. “Yes, there’s the website, the infrastructure: why are we allowing access to it in the UK? “But there’s also the local element. Some of the images on the thread were FaceTime screen shots. The image in the corner of the man on the calls could clearly be seen. We positively IDed at least two of them. We know who they are, where they live and told the police – but they didn’t even knock on their doors. Perpetrators have so many admissible defences. ‘I did it for a laugh and didn’t think she’d see.’ ‘I was paid a tenner to upload pictures of girls in my area.’ Doing it for sexual gratification is an admissible defence. We’re campaigning to remove the motive element from the law. Sharing intimate images without consent is the bottom line and that’s what should be illegal.” There are signs that things will change. The Law Commission review of the laws around intimate image abuse began in 2019; the final report this spring is expected to make nonconsensual sharing an offence. However, warns McGlynn, changing the law is a very slow process – and only part of the solution. “It also comes back to culture change, education, work in schools,” she says. “Evidence from studies shows that just as teenage girls are pressured to send nudes, teenage boys are also feeling pressure to get nudes and share them, to gain kudos. Collecting digital trophies is becoming part of being a boy and a man – that’s what we need to change.”In the meantime, Ruby is not sure that it’s worth knowing that your images are online, passed between others, traded, shared, collected and commented on by friends and strangers. “It’s really difficult,” she says. “On the thread for our town, there are girls I recognise, who I haven’t spoken to since I was 16. You feel a sense of moral obligation. Do I tell them – even when I know nothing is going to come of reporting it and there’s nothing they can do? Is it better that they don’t know or is it better that they do know and are as distressed as we were? I’ve decided I’m not going to pop up and derail their life. Maybe ignorance is bliss.” Some survivors’ names have been changed.",News/World news,‘I have moments of shame I can’t control’: the lives ruined by explicit ‘collector culture’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/i-have-moments-of-shame-i-cant-control-the-lives-ruined-by-explicit-collector-culture

1/6/2022,"One of the only black female QCs in England and Wales has said the time has come for action and “no more talk” when it comes to tackling race inequality in the legal profession. Barbara Mills, who is co-chair of the Bar Council’s race working group, said the next 12 months would be “critical” to tackling systemic obstacles at the bar.  These were identified in the group’s landmark Race at the Bar report, which found that there were just five black female QCs (senior barristers, also known as silks) in England and Wales (another two were announced in the latest appointments, published on 22 December). Another stark statistic was that a black female junior barrister with the same level of experience as a white male junior billed £18,700 a year less on average, and an Asian woman £16,400 less. Elsewhere, the judiciary said only 1% of judges in courts and tribunals were black, a figure that is unchanged since 2014 Mills says there had been “well-meaning people” in the profession but a more strategic approach was required to boost diversity. “If, in a year’s time – I shouldn’t say if – when, in a year’s time, we have … all sorts of stakeholders with clearly defined targets, which we can then work to and then hold them to account, that would be real progress,” said Mills. “The system didn’t get like this overnight and none of us can hope that the change will be overnight but what the race working group members and our brown and black colleagues are expecting is a sense, a feeling of visibility, that it’s changing – no more talk, just change it and let me see that it’s changing. So, I think the next 12 months are critical.” Mills said the fact that the race working group even existed, and racial inequality was being talked about openly within the profession, showed progress since she was first called to the bar in 1990. But the next step required targets – not to be confused with quotas – to pave the way for tangible action, she said. She shied away from discussing her own experience, instead focusing on “holding my hand out as I climb up”. But Mills is under no illusions about her own visibility as a black female QC, given that by comparison there are 1,303 white men and 286 white women who are silks, according to the report, which used figures calculated before the latest round of appointments. “I was really struck when I took silk,” she said. “My inbox was flooded with messages from black women who I didn’t know who were either students or young barristers, who said: ‘Oh, my God, it’s possible. Thank you, thank you for making it look and be possible.’” Targets for QCs from minority-ethnic backgrounds, as well as for appointments to the judiciary and panels, are one of a raft of recommendations in the Race at the Bar report, which focuses on access to the profession, retention, progress and culture. Mills said those asking if there was really a problem were in the minority and she “can’t understand or believe that anybody doubts the value of diversity any more”. She said: “You can’t have a system whereby in something as fundamental and as important to people as the legal system, there are those in society who think there’s an ‘us and them’ going on. It can’t be. You can’t have a system where people think: well, the person who will represent me, has no idea of my life, my culture, my heritage, what makes me me, the person who’s going to make a life-altering decision, has no idea of my culture, of who I am. That just doesn’t instil the sort of confidence in the decision-making that we require.”",News/World news,One of the only black female QCs in England and Wales calls for action on inequality,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/inequality-legal-profession-england-and-wales-barbara-mills-qc
1/6/2022,"Mishcon de Reya, one of the UK’s most prestigious law firms, has been fined a record amount for committing “serious breaches” of money-laundering rules. The London-based firm has agreed to pay a fine of £232,500, plus a further £50,000 towards the costs of the investigation, which was carried out by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA).  In its decision, published on Wednesday, the regulator said Mishcon de Reya’s conduct had “potential to cause significant harm by facilitating transactions that gave rise to a risk of facilitating money laundering”. The SRA investigation concerned work the firm carried out for two unnamed individual clients between September 2015 and April 2017, and corporate vehicles connected with the same two individuals. The work included the proposed acquisition of two separate entities that had “higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing” under relevant money-laundering legislation, because they involved companies in high-risk jurisdictions. The regulator found Mishcon de Reya failed to carry out the required level of due diligence or ongoing monitoring. Additionally, between 22 July and 28 July 2016, a payment of £965,000 was made into Mishcon de Reya’s client account and three payments – the highest of $1,099,015, equivalent to £810,000 – were made out of it, none of which related to the delivery of services by the firm, contrary to SRA rules that forbid client accounts being used “as a banking facility”. The firm accepted the SRA’s decision and fine, which is is almost double the previous highest of £124,436, imposed by the regulator on Find My Claims in 2019, for sending six million unsolicited marketing letters to members of the public in respect of mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI). A spokesperson for Mishcon de Reya disputed that the fine was the largest imposed by the SRA because the penalty covered two separate investigations rather than one. The settlement will prevent the investigation looming over the firm as it prepares to float on the London Stock Exchange. The company is expected to seek a value of about £750m, based on typical valuations in the legal sector, a price tag that would make it the largest London-listed law firm, with every member of staff becoming a shareholder. The firm is known for representing the wealthy, famous and powerful. High-profile cases include acting for Diana, Princess of Wales, during her divorce from Prince Charles and for Gina Miller when she took on the government over whether parliament had to approve the triggering of article 50 after the Brexit vote. Keir Starmer advised the firm while in parliament but ended the relationship when he became shadow Brexit secretary in 2016, subsequently turning down the offer of a lucrative second job with the firm. The level of the SRA fine was based on 0.25% of turnover, in the middle of the band of up to 0.5%, because the SRA said “the breaches were serious but the risks did not crystallise into causing harm to clients or the wider public interest”. Based on Mishcon de Reya’s turnover of £155m, that would have been equivalent to £387,500 but it was reduced by the maximum allowable 40% discount to reflect mitigating circumstances. A Mishcon de Reya spokesperson said: “We are pleased to have come to a settlement with the SRA relating to two separate and historic investigations in relation to which we have made appropriate admissions. Mitigating factors such as our cooperation with the SRA throughout the investigations and the corrective action we have taken since to prevent a recurrence have been recognised by the SRA in reaching this outcome.”",News/Law,Top UK law firm fined record sum for breaching money-laundering rules,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/06/top-uk-law-firm-fined-record-sum-serious-money-laundering-rule-breaches-mishcon-de-reya
1/6/2022,"When the insurrectionists of 6 January rampaged through the Capitol, congressman Andrew Clyde of Georgia helped barricade a door, and he fled when the rest of Congress did. A photograph shows him looking panicky, mouth wide open and arm gesticulating wildly, behind what appears to be a security team member with a gun drawn, defending him. But a few months later he declared: “Watching the TV footage of those who entered the Capitol and walked through Statuary Hall showed people in an orderly fashion staying between the stanchions and ropes, taking videos, pictures. You know, if you didn’t know the TV footage was a video from 6 January, you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit.” Clyde’s account of 6 January might be a little more preposterous than those of his fellow Republican legislators. But they all joined him in pretending nothing much had happened and objecting to the investigation of the day’s events. After all, they were partly responsible, most of them. It was elected Republicans who supported and spread the earlier lies that Donald Trump had won the election, the lies that fed the insurrection; and then they lied some more about their own words and actions before, during and after. In the immediate aftermath, the then Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, was angry and shaken, declaring: “The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president.” Then he too began the project of walking it all back.  What has ensued is a cover-up in plain sight. When Trump took office in 2016, Republicans faced a crisis: their party had won, but only by ushering to a minority victory one of history’s most extravagantly dishonest men. They had to stand with him or against him, and most chose to stand with him. Others chose to fade away by resigning or going home when their terms were up. Almost none of them stood up against him. The famously vindictive Trump punished any signs of disloyalty, so they were loyal. And to be loyal meant joining him in corruption and lies. “If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed ... and we will deserve it,” Lindsey Graham tweeted in the spring of 2016, before becoming one of Trump’s most grovelling sycophants. In a way, the sycophants got stronger: if truth restrains us and links us together, they unchained themselves. We make contracts with each other with words; we share information, make agreements and commitments, hold each other accountable and show who we are. Lies are broken contracts, in which words misrepresent what the speaker knows; they aim to delude, exploit and divide. The liar may get stronger, but the social fabric gets weaker. That strength is precarious, so lies have be piled atop lies to keep accountability at a distance. Of course, politicians of all stripes are notoriously shifty, and the Republican party had no great reputation for honesty previously. Many of their campaigns long before Trump could politely be called misleading. But after 2016, they clustered around the gaslighter-in-chief like bugs around a streetlight. I often think of what Trump did as disinhibition: the pallid, bashful untruths of yore were replaced by baldfaced outrages. They lost any compunction about openly contradicting themselves, and did so often, never more than with the insurrection of 6 January. As the mob was smashing its way into the building, congressman Jim Jordan had been on the house floor accusing election officials in six states of corruption. A week later he declared: “I’ve never said that this election was stolen.” But, as CNN noted: “Jordan claimed in October that Democrats were working to steal the election and spoke at a Stop the Steal rally in Pennsylvania two days after the election. In December, he said he didn’t know how he could be convinced that ‘Trump didn’t actually win’ the election.” During the hours when the mob rampaged through the US Capitol building, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy called up Trump, reportedly furious. “The president bears responsibility for the attack,” he said shortly thereafter. Then he devoted himself to winning back Trump’s favour and playing down what had happened. “Pressed on whether he regretted working to overturn President Biden’s 2020 victory, Mr McCarthy took the position that he did no such thing,” the New York Times reported in April. Then he worked hard to sabotage the investigation into what had happened, by trying to put two congressmen most loyal to the big lie, Jim Banks and the ever-disruptive champion shouter Jim Jordan, on the committee. The house majority leader, Nancy Pelosi, blocked their appointment. Banks was later caught sending out letters, seeking information from government agencies, claiming he was the ranking Republican on the 6 January committee, of which he was never in fact a member. By September, McCarthy was full team cover-up: the Guardian’s Hugo Lowell noted that McCarthy “threatened to retaliate against any telecommunications company that complied with the records requests” of the congressional committee investigating the 6 January insurrection. That’s not technically lying, but it’s certainly an attempt to prevent the truth from being known. There’s a lot to cover up, especially if you don’t want the committee to find out the extent to which Congress itself was involved in the attack on Congress. The politicians who fled in fear thereafter threw themselves into denying the threat and protecting its chief instigator. No one did so more slavishly than the then vice-president, Mike Pence, who was pressured before and during 6 January to violate the law and exercise a power he did not possess to change the election outcome. “If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency,” Trump had tweeted early that day; and then, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution”. At Trump’s instigation, the mob was chanting: “Hang Mike Pence!” Pence trivialised the event when he told the Christian Broadcasting Network: “I’m not going to allow the Democrats to use one tragic day in January to distract attention from their failed agenda and the failed policies of the Biden administration.” Capitol police officer Aquilino Gonnell, who was seriously injured defending the politicians, told NPR: “That one day in January almost cost my life. And we did everything possible to prevent him [Pence] from being hanged and killed in front of his daughter and his wife. And now he’s telling us that that one day in January doesn’t mean anything. It’s pathetic. It’s a disgrace.” One of the first lies to explode out of the insurrection was that somehow the attack on the Capitol was the work of Antifa. The very idea of Antifa, as they used it, was an older lie, a transformation of scattered individuals and impromptu groups of antifascists into a cohesive sinister gang that could be blamed for pretty much anything, anywhere. The New York Times described how on 6 January the right was claiming that the insurrection had been led by Antifa, not Trump supporters. By the end of the day, Fox was promoting it, the claim was all over Twitter, and: “Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida had stood on the ransacked House floor and claimed that many rioters ‘were members of the violent terrorist group antifa’.” The claim, the Times added, “has hardened into gospel among hard-line Trump supporters, by voters and sanctified by elected officials in the party” That is, they took the position that the riot, which at the time Republican legislators begged the president to stop, was instead a riot by an essentially imaginary leftwing organisation with no conceivable motive to prevent the confirmation of Biden’s victory. Now the investigation is closing in on the role that many in Congress played in the attack on Congress. Having fled their own mobs, they are now trying to flee the truth, and relying on the fact that a significant portion of the country prefers the lies. The Republicans who helped the failed coup along and then dismissed its import are preparing to do it better next time. The Democratic senator Brian Schatz tweeted on Tuesday: “They are organizing the next one, not as a secret conspiracy, but as a central organizing principle for the next election.” The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said: “Donald Trump has infected, and that’s the appropriate word, the Republican party with his big lie and with his desire to stop democracy. We have no choice but to move forward,” by which he meant overturn the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. 6 January was one confrontation; there’s another one coming. The lies may implode at some point, but the liars have to be defeated. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

1/6/2022,"Andrea Arnold’s films are known for their spare dialogue, and in her first documentary it is more pared-backed than ever: Cow consists of 94 minutes of moos, with the odd off-camera interjection from farmhands. It is hardly a thriller (though the ending is pure Tarantino). But it is one of the most beautifully crafted and tender portraits of a life you are likely to see. Arnold, who started her professional life as a rollerskating TV presenter on the children’s Saturday show No 73, began thinking about documenting an animal’s life nine years ago. Eventually she settled on a cow. “I thought a cow would be interesting because they work so hard, getting pregnant and giving milk their entire lives. It’s a huge job they do.” She chose Luma because she was told she had a big personality and was feisty. Arnold and her team spent four years, on and off, filming her. Why did she make Cow? “I wanted to show a non-human consciousness. I was intrigued as to whether we would be able to see her consciousness if we followed her long enough.”  Her friends have told her Cow is the most personal film she has made. “One friend said there was nowhere for me to hide in a documentary; it was more raw and I was more exposed, she said.” But what is she exposing? “Well, things to do with my childhood, I suppose. But I don’t talk about all that because it’s too complicated. It’s extremely messy, so I can’t really.” We meet at a cafe in south London, where she has has lived for 27 years. Arnold is a youthful 60, dressed in jeans, beret, and a fake fur coat “made of real teddy bear”. She is warm and engaging but fiendishly private. She admits to having a 27-year-old daughter, and being one of four children brought up by a single mother, but declines to answer most questions about family. However, she does it with such charm that the sparring becomes enjoyable. Bits and pieces gradually emerge, from which we can piece together a partial jigsaw. Her films are like this, too: composed of fragments, open to different interpretations. In the autobiographical Wasp, which won the Oscar for best live action short in 2004, a single mother of four is asked out for the first time in years. She pretends she is looking after the kids for a friend and leaves them outside the pub to play without telling her date, which results in all kinds of chaos. Arnold’s narratives are rarely linear and usually elliptical, leaving us to fill in the missing details. In her first full-length work, Red Road, we only begin to understand towards the end of the film why protagonist Jackie has been stalking a newly released prisoner. After it finishes, we find ourselves rewinding the film in our head, reinterpreting all that has gone before – or simply watching it again. Astonishingly, three of her four movies – Red Road, Fish Tank and American Honey – have won the Jury prize at the Cannes film festival. In Fish Tank, which tells the story of a 15-year-old girl finding her way in the world, there is no mention of her absent father because he’s an irrelevance. In American Honey, a road movie about a group of disadvantaged youngsters crossing America and trying to get by flogging magazines, she pretty much does away with backstory. As for her Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights, he barely utters a word – it’s all about the unspoken emotion. Arnold is a wonderful film-maker. Her movies are beautifully written (or under-written), nuanced and gorgeous to look at, even when the world they depict is brutal. They are often unbearably tense, her characters invariably living on the brink of violence or betrayal. Although Cow is a documentary, it still feels very much like an Arnold film. It starts with Luma giving birth. In a lovely extended scene she licks her baby clean of amniotic fluid and the calf starts suckling. Luma really is luminous in the pitch-black cowshed – stills from the film look like bovine Rembrandts. While Cow never anthropomorphises Luma, it does allow us to see the world from her perspective. It’s impossible to watch without imagining what is going on in her head. There are recurrent themes in Arnold’s films – single mums and struggling children, chaotic lives, sexual and commercial exploitation. Cow fits perfectly into this pattern. Luma is the ultimate single mother, constantly pregnant, separated from her children, milked for all she is worth. Arnold’s work could easily be a misery-fest, but it isn’t because she is also alert to all that’s good in life – the intensity of youth, the first flushes of love and lust, dancing yourself to oblivion, the power of resilience. Her characters may not thrive but they are survivors. Again, Cow is consistent with that vision. We experience the purity of the mother-child bond in the first few hours after birth, the joy of the cows at spring turnout when they are let loose in the fields, the literal and metaphorical fireworks as cattle mate on Bonfire Night. As in all her work, music plays a large part. Some songs are piped into the cowsheds from Radio 1 to keep cattle and farmhands happy; others are handpicked by Arnold. Although animals are not the subject of her other films, they feature prominently. In Red Road, Jackie, who works as a CCTV security camera operator, frequently zooms in on a man with a dog – without saying a word, Arnold conveys Jackie’s sense of longing. In Fish Tank, 15-year-old Mia suffers so much trauma in silence, and it’s only when she hears her friend’s horse has been put down that she cries. And Arnold’s short Dog features one of cinema’s most disturbing animal scenes. A teenage girl and boy are having sex. As usual, we witness the scene from the girl’s perspective. While the boy thrusts away, the girl sees a dog steal his stash of dope and eat it. She laughs – at what she has just witnessed, not the boy. But the boy feels humiliated and takes a terrible revenge on the dog. Animals have played a huge part in Arnold’s life. When she was young, the family home on a low-rise estate in Dartford, Kent, was full of waifs and strays – numerous cats and dogs, guinea pigs and gerbils, and a sheep who lived in the garden but would wander in for the occasional chat. “I remember Mum going absolutely mad when we got back with the lamb.” Her mother, who was only 16 when Arnold was born, died a couple of years ago. Were they close? “I’m not going to talk about it,” she says in a sing-song voice. Fish Tank is about the troubled and competitive relationship between Mia (an aspiring dancer, as Arnold was) and her mother. They even compete over her mother’s boyfriend Conor, played with a chilling brilliance by Michael Fassbender. At times Mia is ferocious (she headbutts a fellow schoolgirl without compunction, and abducts Conor’s daughter in a terrifying scene) yet we are always aware of her vulnerability. I ask Arnold if she could headbutt her way out of trouble as a teenager. She laughs. No, she says – she has never had a scrap in her life. “But I’ve stopped fights. I can probably count 20 fights I’ve stopped in the last few years. I’m very good at reading that kind of situation and I’m not frightened of it. It’s probably why I’m a film-maker. I’m vigilant and able to read people. I’ve got some skills from my childhood that have served me well as a film-maker.” Did she stop fights as a kid? “I tried to sometimes. But that’s difficult to talk about because; that’s a lot to do with my …” She trails off. “I can’t talk about this stuff. It involves too many people.” So instead she tells me how she stopped a fight in a pub in Essex. “One of the blokes had the guy on the ground and was kicking his head against the gutter. And everyone was just watching. The guy who was kicking him suddenly got tired, stopped and was panting and I saw there was a moment to get in there. Also because I’m a female I feel they’re not going to turn on me.” She pauses. “Though I have stopped fights and they have turned on me. I stopped a boy hitting his girlfriend. He was punching her in the street and nobody was doing anything and I got in between them. The girl ran away, and he just went mad at me. He got hold of my hair, pushed me on the ground and spat at me. Then my friend had to try to get him off me.” What makes her intervene? “I can’t bear seeing people being cruel or violent to other people.” Has she always been fearless? “I’ve always been fearless, but I’m not tough.” She thinks about what she’s just said. “Actually fearlessness is a kind of toughness.” The young Arnold was a bright girl, who rarely got the opportunity to excel. She left her comprehensive school at 16 to take up hairdressing, hated it, and returned to the sixth form. At 18, she auditioned to be a presenter for No 73, and got the job. She looked so cool – rollerskating, glamorous, carefree – but she says she was always uncomfortable in front of the camera. “I think I look terrified. It was live so it was terrifying. Everyone I was with had done some training and I hadn’t done any whatsoever.” After seven years, when No 73 finished, she decided to reinvent herself as a director. She realised she could turn the stories she had been writing into films. Arnold disappeared from view and has rarely been seen on TV again. She was so determined to make a new start that she swapped continents to retrain at the American Film Institute of Los Angeles. In 1998, she made her first short film, Milk, about a traumatised woman who has given birth to a stillborn baby and addresses her grief by having sex with a man young enough to be her son, who ensures her breast milk doesn’t go to waste. Whatever Arnold’s protagonists have been through, they are never simple victims; they still have “lots of lights on” as she says. The same can be said of Luma. She has endured the toughest of lives, but there is never any sense of her giving up. Towards the end of the film, her udder ligaments have ruptures, she can barely be milked, and she drags her teats painfully along the floor. But, Arnold says, the more she struggled, the more stoic she became. “I sensed this huge sense of service for us. She was still doing this thing she’s been taught to do.” The longer she spent with Luma the more she was able to read her moo music. As the animal got older, and was separated from more calves, she also seemed to become angrier, Arnold says. She is convinced Luma felt compassion for the other pregnant cows, aware of what they were about to lose. “They say the difference between humans and animals is that we can see the past and think about the future, but I could see Luma knew what’s coming when she’s pregnant. She got particularly mad when she saw the farmer taking away a calf from another cow.” Every time she does a Q&A with an audience about Cow, Arnold is amazed by the response. “We had a screening at the London film festival. People were crying, one person fainted, somebody was sick, somebody had a panic attack. Somebody said to me it made them think women’s bodies are not their own; somebody said ‘It makes me think of infertility and how hard I’ve tried for a baby’; somebody said ‘It’s made me feel about my mother and the relationship we’ve never had’; somebody talked about the relationship with a mother she did have, and somebody said it made them think about how our lives are managed.” As for Arnold, more than anything Cow has made her think of the importance of being seen. “I kept saying involuntarily during the edit: ‘I’m seeing you, Luma. Don’t worry Luma, we see you.’ I’m not sure any farm animal really feels seen. And I wondered what that meant in terms of her existence.” Has making the film changed her? “Every film changes me. I take a long time making every film, and each one is like a massive growth for me.” She returns to the idea of being seen. “I wonder how much we see not just other animals but each other. Do we really take on board each other and listen and react to people – our families, our friends, our partners, the person on the street?” She knows she’s just made a film about a cow, but to her it feels more elemental. “It’s made me feel a lot about how we’re all connected. I think all living things feel the kindness or cruelty of other living things, so all the decisions we make about how we behave with animals, with plants, with somebody getting on the bus, are so important.”  Cow is in cinemas in the UK and Ireland from 14 January and exclusively on MUBI from 11 February",Arts/Film,"‘I kept saying – don’t worry Luma, we see you’: Andrea Arnold on her four years filming a cow",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/i-kept-saying-dont-worry-luma-we-see-you-andrea-arnold-on-her-four-years-filming-a-cow
1/6/2022,"Britain has been accused of reviving a policy of “targeted killing” after it emerged that the RAF had killed an arms dealer linked to Islamic State in a precision drone strike in Syria at the end of October. Reprieve, a human rights charity, asked “what are the criteria” used to justify who can be targeted in a “track and kill” drone strike, and called on ministers to tell the Commons why this strike was deemed necessary.  The group’s comments come after the Ministry of Defence announced on its website, more than a month after the attack, that the crew of a Reaper drone, armed with 100lb Hellfire missiles, had “tracked a known terrorist in northern Syria”. In a brief statement, the MoD added: “And at a safe moment, when the individual was alone in a field, carried out a successful attack.” The drone raid took place on 25 October and was disclosed on 27 November. Subsequent reporting by the Syrians for Truth and Justice (STJ) group, based on interviews conducted on the ground, concluded that the victim was Abu Hamza al-Shuhail, “a well-known arms dealer in the region” who had sold weapons to several parties during the long running Syrian conflict, “chiefly Islamic State”. Jennifer Gibson, who leads for Reprieve on extrajudicial killings, said: “This announcement, slipped out on a quiet Saturday morning on the MoD website, appears to herald a new UK government targeted killing policy. “So what are its criteria for tracking and killing? How did it determine that this person was worthy of assassination? And why wasn’t parliament consulted or even informed?” The MoD said it had not changed its policy and said the UK has “a robust target clearance process, operates under strict rules of engagement, and is fully compliant with international law”. It published “regular updates” on airstrikes conducted against IS targets for “full transparency”, a spokesperson added. The drone strike on al-Shuhail appears to have been conducted in conjunction with Turkey. Shortly after the attack, Turkish ground troops encircled a nearby farm and killed a gunman in the compound linked to al-Shuhail including two unconnected civilians who had been nearby, the STJ added. Al-Shuhail had recently relocated near Ras al-Ayn, an area controlled by the Turkish military, having been smuggled out of an area controlled by the Syrian Kurds. Kurdish defence forces had asked the arms dealer that “he help them locate IS cells in the area and find the places where IS hid weapons”, according to the local reports, a request that had him “fearing for his life”. RAF fighters and drones have been engaged in more than 5,000 missions against IS in Syria since MPs voted in favour of military intervention in the country in December 2015. Strikes in Iraq were authorised in September 2014. Reprieve said it believed the raid was the first “track and kill” drone operation targeting a known individual to be acknowledged by the UK since the killing of 21-year-old Briton Reyaad Khan in Syria in August 2015 by an RAF drone strike – although the circumstances were different. At the time MPs had not voted for air raids against IS targets in Syria, only Iraq. A fortnight later, David Cameron, then the prime minister, came to parliament to justify the targeting of Khan – describing it as “necessary and proportionate for the individual self-defence of the UK”. Intelligence indicated that the jihadist and other associates were plotting to attack “high-profile public commemorations”, Cameron added, and it emerged that the UK had drawn up a “kill list” of IS targets following the 2015 general election. Reprieve hopes the recent drone strike will be the subject of questions to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, when he appears in the Commons on Monday. There is no immediate evidence that al-Shuhail had any connection or link to the UK.",News/World news,UK accused of ‘targeted killing’ after drone strike on arms dealer to IS,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/uk-accused-of-targeted-killing-after-drone-strike-on-arms-dealer-to-is
1/6/2022,"In light of the energy crisis in the UK, installing a smart meter and heat pump as measures to help combat the climate crisis have exposed serious failings in government policy. A heat pump may be four times as efficient as the best gas-condensing boiler, but the cost of heating a home is as great because of the high price of electricity. The new year weekend of high temperatures across the UK brought this sharply into focus. The heating was off and, even though everything else in the house is electric, daily bills, measured by the smart meter, dropped by two thirds.  At the same time notice of new tariffs arrived. Gas will be 8.38p per kilowatt-hour, a rise of less than 2p, while electricity will be 34.64 per kWh, 10.28p more. So electricity will continue to be more than four times the price of gas. Those who turned their backs on fossil fuels and have all-electric homes with suppliers that guarantee power only from renewables are paying a heavy price for their commitment. The distortion is caused partly by the policy of previous governments – loading electricity prices to pay for subsidies for renewables and to discourage the use of coal power stations, while subsidising gas as a cleaner fuel. For the climate’s sake this needs to change.",Lifestyle/Money,High cost of electricity exposes UK energy policy failings,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/06/high-cost-of-electricity-exposes-uk-energy-policy-failings
1/6/2022,"The acquittal of four people charged with criminal damage for toppling the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston during a Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol is the latest in a series of cases in which juries have cleared protesters despite there being no question of their having carried out the actions for which they were tried. Most recent examples related to the environment, with those on trial arguing that their deeds were a proportionate response to the climate crisis. Here are some examples.  Roger Hallam, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, was cleared by a jury in 2019 despite not denying causing criminal damage worth £7,000 when he sprayed the walls of Kings College London, with the words “divest from oil and gas” in protest against the institution’s fossil fuel investments. Hallam, who was acquitted along with another activist, said it showed “ordinary people, unlike the judiciary, are able to see the broader picture”. In April 2021 six Extinction Rebellion protesters were cleared of causing criminal damage to Shell’s London headquarters despite the judge directing jurors that those on trial had no defence in law. Protesters poured fake oil, glued themselves to windows and doors, broke glass, climbed on to a roof and sprayed graffiti as part of wider demonstrations across the capital. Before reaching their verdicts, the jury had asked to see a copy of the oath they took when they were sworn in. Thanking the jurors, the judge said it had been “an unusual case”. Six climate crisis activists whose protest halted the Docklands Light Railway, which serves London’s financial district, were acquitted by a jury in December 2021. Five of the Extinction Rebellion protesters climbed on top of the train with banners that read “Business As Usual=Death” and “Don’t Jail the Canaries” while a sixth glued herself to a train window. They were charged with obstructing trains or carriages on the railway and acknowledged their roles in the protest but successfully argued that their action was a lawful protest against government inaction on the climate crisis. While there has been a flurry of cases involving Extinction Rebellion recently, there have been previous examples of acquittals by juries concluding that ostensibly criminal actions were motivated by good intentions. In 2008 six Greenpeace climate change activists were cleared of causing £30,000 of criminal damage at Kingsnorth power station, Kent. The activists admitted trying to shut down the coal-fired station by occupying the smokestack but argued they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change causing greater damage to property around the world. It was the first case in which preventing property damage caused by climate change had been used as part of a “lawful excuse” defence in court. In 2001 Lord Melchett, then executive director of Greenpeace, and 27 other supporters were cleared by a court of causing criminal damage despite admitting destroying a crop of genetically modified maize. The defendants said that they acted to prevent pollen from the maize from polluting neighbouring organic crops and gardens. There have also been a string of acquittals in cases of sabotage of military equipment. In 2007, two anti-war campaigners, Toby Olditch and Philip Pritchard, who broke into RAF Fairford Gloucestershire, to sabotage US bombers at the outbreak of the Iraq war, were cleared of conspiring to cause criminal damage after they argued the B52s would have been used to commit war crimes in Iraq. In 2000, two anti-nuclear protesters who entered a dockyard planning to disarm one of Britain’s Trident submarines with an axe were cleared of conspiracy to cause criminal damage. Sylvia Boyes and River (formerly known as Keith Wright) admitted that they plotted to damage HMS Vengeance while it was docked at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, in November 1999, but claimed their actions were justified because nuclear weapons were immoral and illegal under international law.",News/World news,Jurors see the bigger picture: activists who were cleared in court,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/jurors-see-the-bigger-picture-activists-who-were-cleared-in-court
1/6/2022,"Chinese hospital officials have been fired after a pregnant woman lost her baby after she was denied entry at a Xi’an hospital due to coronavirus lockdown restrictions. On the night of 1 January a woman in labour was denied entry to the Xi’an Gaoxin hospital because her negative test result was four hours too old. She began bleeding heavily while waiting outside, and was eventually admitted but the baby died.  The woman’s story and an accompanying video went viral on social media, and was reported by local Chinese media. On Wednesday, the Shaanxi Province and Xi’an Municipal Health Commission said it had launched an investigation and determined the baby’s death was an “accident caused by negligence”. Two hospital officials were fired and a manager suspended. The head of the Xi’an health commission also received a formal warning from the Chinese Communist party for mishandling emergency care in the city. Xi’an, a city of 13 million in Shaanxi province, is two weeks into a strict lockdown that has kept residents inside their homes and shut down entertainment venues, shops and public transport. Authorities say the lockdown has allowed them to get on top of the outbreak of Covid cases, which they said were now trending downwards. However, there have also been concerning reports of food shortages and delayed or blocked access to medical care. Strict vaccine and testing requirements for anyone seeking medical care appeared to cause confusion and prevent some people from accessing emergency treatment. In a statement reported by state media, the hospital in the woman’s case said it had done “everything that should be done”. “Now the Health Commission and the Women’s Federation are investigating. They paid much attention to it, and they were more than fair.” The hospital has been ordered to apologise to the public, improve its processes, and ensure all patients can access emergency care. Epidemic prevention and control were not grounds for preventing a patient’s treatment, authorities said, and new “green” channels would be opened for patients with acute and critical illnesses to access treatment. On Wednesday officials also said cases were trending down in Xi’an, with most new cases detected in quarantine or closed areas. More than 42,000 people have been put into quarantine centres, according to state media. Xi’an has recorded about 1,800 cases since 9 December. China’s continued commitment to zero Covid has apparent general public support in a country that has recorded far fewer cases than many other nations despite the virusfirst being detected there. However, there are growing concerns about the impact of continued restrictions, which are getting stricter as local officials strive to prevent and respond to outbreaks or face potential punishment.

1/6/2022,"What would farmers do without baler twine? Blue, pink, yellow or orange, this thin, strong, polypropylene string seems to hold the countryside together. It ties up gates, zigzags crazily across holes in fences and lashes down tarpaulins. Originally made of natural sisal fibre, baler twine was invented towards the end of the 19th century. Its primary purpose was to machine-bind hay and straw bales. But what did people use before industrialisation, when they had to rely on the materials immediately to hand? Withy, or willow, is one answer. Its slender, whippy stems have been used for millennia for weaving and fastening: the root meaning of “withy” is to twist or plait.  Basketmaker Malcolm Seal cultivates willow on his smallholding near Powerstock Common, north-west of Dorchester, where he also keeps curly fleeced Gotland sheep. I visit on a day when he is harvesting coarse withies suitable for garden structures. Willow grows fast in damp earth – in one year Malcolm’s plants reach nearly three metres high. I watch as he cuts the stems close to the ground and gathers them into bundles, known as wads. He secures each wad with a withy bond, a traditional tie made from a single, long stem. There are several stages in making a bond. First, Malcolm takes a withy stem and whirls it clockwise – this is called cranking. There’s a small, dry pop as the fibres break, then he twists it and lets the tightened stem turn back on itself. He threads the straight end through the loop and then encircles the wad, before further cranking and coiling so the tie is held in place by its own tension. That twisting, self-hold principle is an ancient method, used for all manner of materials: thatchers employed it to secure straw to roofs and hayricks. It even works for hair. In 1948, two men cutting peat in a willow-grown bog near Osterby in Germany uncovered a human head. The man’s long hair was held back in a distinctive self-tying fashion, similar to a withy bond. The Roman historian Tacitus describes this iron-age hairstyle – known as a Suebian knot – in his account of Germanic tribes, written in about AD98.
