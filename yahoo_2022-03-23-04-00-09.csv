3/23/2022,"A Russian oligarch's yacht captain said the crew caught fish as suppliers refused to fuel the ship. The superyacht believed to belong to Vladimir Strzhalkovsky has been stuck in Norway for a month. Strzhalkovsky hasn't been sanctioned by the EU, which means Norway can't seize the vessel. The crew aboard a Russian oligarch's superyacht in Norway is catching and barbecuing fish as local businesses refuse to refuel the vessel, which has left it stranded, the boat's captain told The Wall Street Journal. The vessel, Ragnar, is believed to be owned by Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, a former KGB agent who has ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin but has avoided sanctions, the outlet reported. Ragnar, worth $85 million, according to SuperYacht Fan, has been stuck in the port of Narvik, Norway, for over a month because fuel suppliers are refusing to do business with Strzhalkovsky. Strzhalkovsky isn't among the Russian oligarchs who have been hit by Western sanctions, but Norwegian fuel suppliers told the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK last week that they didn't want to help any entities associated with Russia. The US, the UK, and the European Union have levied sanctions against oligarchs believed to be close to Putin, which has led to seizures of yachts and private jets. In some countries, people have protested against Russian goods and entities that aren't sanctioned. Dockworkers in the UK this month refused to handle consignments of Russian natural gas, despite UK sanctions at the time allowing the import of the goods. With no one willing to refuel the boat and nowhere to go, the crew of the Ragnar has been barbecuing freshly caught cod, Rob Lancaster, the yacht's captain, told The Journal. ""We did not realize why there was so much fuss with us,"" Lancaster told The Journal. ""It happened so quickly."" Lancaster told NRK last week that the 16 crew members on board were from Western countries and ""have nothing to do with the owner of the boat."" While the Ragnar is not subject to sanctions, a number of oligarchs' yachts have been impounded in Europe. A $75 million yacht belonging to the Russian businessman Dmitry Pumpyansky was seized on Monday after it docked in Gibraltar, the local government told Insider. It followed Spain's detention of a $153 million superyacht linked to the arms tycoon Sergey Chemezov, France impounding a $120 million vessel linked to Putin's confidant Igor Sechin, and Italy seizing a $578 million vessel linked to the oligarch Andrey Melnichenko.

3/23/2022,"The woman who shoved a beloved singing coach to her death earlier this month has been arrested, the New York Police Department announced Tuesday. Lauren Pazienza, 26, turned herself in at an NYPD precinct in the Chelsea neighborhood with her attorney Tuesday morning, according to the New York Post. She was charged with manslaughter after allegedly shoving Barbara Maier Gustern, 87, while running down a New York City street on March 10. Gustern fell, hit her head on the pavement, and was transported to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition. She died on March 14 due to a traumatic brain injury, police said. Gustern was known for coaching Blondie singer Debbie Harry and the cast of the Broadway musical Oklahoma! Pazienza’s arrest came days after police released photos of her at a subway station as they sought the public’s help in identifying her. “This is a disgusting and disgraceful offense committed against a vulnerable, elderly woman doing nothing but walking down the streets of New York City,” the NYPD’s Chief of Detectives James Essig said at the time, according to the New York Daily News. Gustern’s funeral is scheduled for March 26. Her family has been hosting viewings of her apartment for close associates, according to Gustern’s Facebook page. Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/23/2022,"By Martin Quin Pollard WUZHOU, China (Reuters) -Rescuers in southern China searched for survivors from a China Eastern Airlines jet on Tuesday after it crashed with 132 people on board and authorities said severe damage to the aircraft would make it difficult to establish the cause of the crash. Flight MU5735 was headed on Monday for the port city of Guangzhou from Kunming, capital of the southwestern province of Yunnan, when it plunged from cruising altitude to crash in the mountains of Guangxi less than an hour before landing time. A jet appeared to dive to the ground at an angle of about 35 degrees from the vertical in video images from a vehicle's dashboard camera, according to Chinese media. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage. No survivors have been found yet, said Zhu Tao, director of aviation safety at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told reporters. ""The jet was seriously damaged during the crash, and investigations will face a very high level of difficulty,"" Zhu said at the first government briefing on the disaster. ""Given the information currently available, we still do not have a clear assessment of the cause for the crash,"" he said, adding that the aircraft did not respond to repeated calls from air controllers during its rapid descent. On Tuesday, rescuers combed heavily forested mountain slopes in southern China, using shovels and torches in their search for victims and flight recorders from the jet that crashed with 132 people on board. About 600 soldiers, firefighters and police marched to the crash site, a patch of about 1 sq km in a location hemmed in by mountains on three sides, after excavators cleared a path, state television said. It added that the search for the recorders, or ""black boxes"", of the Boeing 737-800 involved in China's first crash of a commercial jetliner since 2010, would be carried out in grid-by-grid fashion, probably through the night. 'BANG, BANG' Si, 64, a villager near the crash site who declined to give his first name, told Reuters he heard a ""bang, bang"" at the time of the crash. ""It was like thunder,"" he said. State television has shown images of plane debris strewn among trees charred by fire. Burnt remains of identity cards and wallets were also seen. Rain was forecast in the area this week. Police set up a checkpoint at Lu village, on the approach to the site, and barred journalists from entering. Several people gathered for a small Buddhist ceremony nearby to pray for the victims. The last commercial jetliner to crash in China was in 2010, when an Embraer E-190 regional jet flown by Henan Airlines went down, killing 44 of the 96 aboard. Highlighting the top-level concern, Vice Premier Liu He went to Guangxi on Monday night to oversee search and rescue operations. An official of the same rank was similarly sent to the site of the 2010 crash in northeast China. ""That B737-800 jet met airworthiness standards before taking off and technical conditions were stable,"" Sun Shiying, a China Eastern official, said at the briefing. ""The crew members were in good health, and their flying experience was in line with regulatory requirements,"" he said. PLANES GROUNDED The disaster comes as Boeing seeks to rebound from several crises, notably the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on air travel and safety concerns over its 737 MAX model following two deadly crashes. ""Accidents that start at cruise altitude are usually caused by weather, deliberate sabotage, or pilot error,"" Dan Elwell, a former head of U.S. regulator the Federal Aviation Administration, told Reuters. Elwell, who led the FAA during the 737-MAX crisis, said mechanical failures in modern commercial jets were rare at cruise altitude. The 737-800 was delivered on June 22, 2015, and accumulated 18,239 hours of flight time after 8,986 flights, said Zhu. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Monday appointed an investigator, as the Boeing aircraft was produced in the United States, but it was unclear if the investigator would travel to China. On Monday, China Eastern and two subsidiaries grounded its fleet of 737-800 planes. The group has 225 of the aircraft, data from British aviation consultancy IBA shows.

The father of a 35-year-old old woman whose badly decomposed body was found in a car along with her 3-year-old twins struggled for answers Tuesday as Melbourne detectives work to determine how the three died. Police said Andrea Langhorst, who lived off and on in her Cadillac with her two children, Olivia and Adam, was identified Monday. The three were identified by police as being from St. Lucie County. An autopsy is scheduled to determine the exact cause of deaths for the three, whose bodies were found in the car, parked at Manatee Cove apartments off of U.S. 1 in Melbourne. ""It's still under investigation. We don't have any information as far as how long they were there. But she was living out of her car,"" said Lt. Shaun Hill, spokesman for the Melbourne Police Department. Detectives have no reason to believe there is an active or persistent danger to the community because of the deaths, he said. More: Melbourne detectives working to identify three bodies found in parked car More: Mental health struggles a 'plague' in law enforcement, attendees say at remembrance for Palm Bay police chief Randy Langhorst, of Fort Pierce, said he and his family were devastated by the news. He had not heard from his daughter since March 11 and had contacted police last weekend to be on the lookout for her. ""We were looking for her and hadn't heard anything from her. That was unusual for her. We wouldn't have daily contact with her, but this was a while,"" Langhorst told FLORIDA TODAY. ""She was a free spirit, smart as a whip, beautiful, but lived her life to the beat of her own drummer. It's just a tragedy,"" he said, his voice wavering with emotion. The gruesome discovery was reported to Melbourne police at 10:50 p.m Sunday after a caller relayed a message that there was a suspicious vehicle parked at the Manatee Cove Apartment complex at 746 Madelyn Way. Patrol officers arrived within minutes, approached the gray Cadillac, which was emanating a foul smell near the trash bin. The windows were fogged, reports show. Officers spotted the remains of the mother and the twins inside the vehicle. Detectives had the vehicle and the remains moved to the Brevard medical examiner's office where investigators were working to find any evidence of blunt force trauma. More: Learn how to use the e-Edition A blood toxicology was also scheduled to determine if drug use was a factor. It's not known if the three died at the same time, or if the mother died first and the children later. Detectives were hoping to review video of the Cadillac as it pulled into the apartment complex's parking lot and any interaction Andrea Langhorst may have had with anyone. Randy Langhorst said he suspects drugs may have been a factor in his daughter's death. Andrea Langhorst had several drug arrests and had attended drug court, St. Lucie County court records show. The children's father is at the Brevard County Jail Complex, awaiting trial in an unrelated case, investigators said. ""The twins were her pride and joy. All I can think is that maybe...maybe the car was running and she fell asleep, maybe the fumes overwhelmed them. I don't know,"" Langhorst said. Andrea and the twins had stayed with her parents in Fort Pierce during the holidays. They shared Thanksgiving as the grandparents watched the movie ""Shrek"" with Adam and taught Olivia how to swim. ""Olivia was a little more outgoing,"" Langhorst said. In addition to living in her car, Andrea stayed at Airbnb rentals, staying off the radar, her father said. He described her as being in pretty good spirits when he last saw her. Her parents had talked with Andrea repeatedly about the possibility of the grandkids staying with them, but Andrea was insistent on keeping her children, her father recalled. ""It was final. It was her decision. We didn't exactly approve of her lifestyle. Everything is hindsight, but I'll be kicking my (butt) for the rest of my life,"" he said. ""All I can think about are those babies.""
