3/9/2022,"Andrey Kozyrev laid out reasons why Putin may have misjudged his invasion of Ukraine. He says Putin overestimated Russia's military, not realizing its budget had been embezzled. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has stalled amid tough Ukrainian resistance. A former Russian foreign minister claimed that widespread corruption is among the reasons for the Russian military's apparently poor performance in the invasion of Ukraine. Andrey Kozyrev, who served as foreign minister under President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s, put forward what he said were misjudgments made by President Vladimir Putin in ordering the invasion. In the thread, he claims Putin overestimated the Russian military, which he dedicated billions of dollars to modernizing. But this money, Kozyrev claimed, may have been lost to Russia's endemic corruption. ""The Kremlin spent the last 20 years trying to modernize its military. Much of that budget was stolen and spent on mega-yachts in Cyprus. But as a military advisor you cannot report that to the President. So they reported lies to him instead,"" wrote Kozyrev. Cyprus has long been a favored destination for Russian officials seeking to launder money, and was infamous for its long-running ""golden passport"" scheme that until 2020 allowed rich foreigners to effectively EU buy citizenship. Transparency International ranks Russia as one of the world's most corrupt countries, putting it 130th of 176, with a particular problem in its defense sector. Polina Beliakova, an expert at Tufts University, wrote in Politico, that rampant corruption meant Russian troops were going into battle in Ukraine with out-of-date rations, faulty equipment, and inadequate fuel supplies. According to western officials, Putin expected the invasion of Ukraine to be ended swiftly and successfully. But instead it stalled, with the the capital, Kyiv, still in Ukrainian control, Russia having failed to establish air superiority, and casualties mounting amid stiff Ukrainian resistance. Kozyrev appeared to be reacting to speculation about Putin's state of mind before launching the invasion. Some officials and commentators claimed there was no rational explanation for the invasion, and that Putin's judgment may have been hampered by his long self-imposed isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some wondered whether he was unhinged enough to launch nuclear weapons if cornered. But Kozyrev, whose stint as foreign secretary came as Russia sought closer ties with the West after the collapse of the Soviet Union, said he believes Putin is instead a rational decision-maker who had poor assumptions that led him into an error. He said that Putin likely believed his own propaganda about Ukraine not being a real nation, which he highlighted when seeking to to justify the invasion. Kozyrev also said he underestimated the unity of the West, which responded to the attack with sanctions that have been crippling the Russian economy. ""So, in my opinion, he is rational. Given that he is rational, I strongly believe he will not intentionally use nuclear weapons against the West,"" Kozyrev said.

3/9/2022,"STORY: ""We're banning all imports of Russian oil and gas energy,"" Biden told reporters at the White House. ""That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable in U.S. ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's war machine."" Oil prices jumped on the news, with Benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 for May climbing by 5.4% to $129.91 a barrel by 1345 GMT. Biden has been working with allies in Europe, who are far more dependent on Russian oil, to isolate Russia's energy-heavy economy and Putin. Britain announced shortly before Biden's remarks that it would phase out the import of Russian oil and gas by the end of 2022. Biden said sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies had already caused the Russian economy to ""crater.""

3/9/2022,"Barr called Rudy Giuliani's Four Seasons Total Landscaping press event ""a grotesque embarrassment."" Giuliani, Trump's former lawyer, promoted baseless election fraud claims at the event. Barr detailed his thoughts around the 2020 election in his new memoir released Tuesday. Former Attorney General William Barr wrote in his new memoir that the infamous November 2020 press conference hosted by President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani in the parking lot of a small company called Four Seasons Total Landscaping was ""a grotesque embarrassment."" Barr shared his thoughts on the failed efforts by Trump's legal team to challenge the 2020 election results in his new book, ""One Damn Thing After Another,"" released on Tuesday. ""His legal team had a difficult case to make, and they made it as badly and unprofessionally as I could have imagined,"" Barr wrote, pointing to the ""bizarre"" Four Seasons Total Landscaping press conference on November 7 and the November 19 press event ""in which mascara appeared to drip from"" Giuliani's sideburns. ""It was all a grotesque embarrassment,"" Barr added. Four days after the 2020 presidential election, Giuliani promoted baseless voter fraud claims during a press conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping, a small landscaping business in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Yet Giuliani's claims were drowned out by critics mocking the event venue, theorizing that Trump's legal team mistakenly booked the landscaping business instead of the luxury Four Seasons hotel. ""A gap soon developed between what Giuliani and his team were saying in public and what they were telling courts. In public, they aired sweeping but unsubstantiated assertions of voter fraud,"" Barr wrote. ""But in their court papers—as Giuliani frankly acknowledged—they were not claiming fraud."" Indeed, as the press briefing took place, major news networks projected then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden as the winner of the election, prompting an outcry from Giuliani. ""The call for Joe Biden isn't, isn't — who was it called by?"" Giuliani asked. A reporter replied that ""all"" the major cable news networks had announced that Biden was the expected winner. ""All of them! Oh my goodness! Wow, all the networks! We have to forget about the law, judges don't count!"" Giuliani responded sarcastically, throwing his arms in the air. Giuliani and other members of Trump's legal team continued to pursue efforts to overturn the results in several battleground states that Biden won, though they were unsuccessful. Federal, state, and local officials have repeatedly said there was no widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Barr made no secret of his disdain for Giuliani in his book, calling the former mayor ""an unguided missile."" The former AG described his frustration with how Giuliani tried to rope the Department of Justice into his schemes to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden's son Hunter in 2019 and then to back Trump's false claims of massive fraud in the 2020 election. ""Rudy Giuliani saved New York City after 9/11 and should go down as probably the most consequential mayor of a big city in American history,"" Barr wrote. ""But he will also go down as the man who helped President Trump get himself impeached—not once but, as it turned out, twice.""

3/9/2022,"Ukraine forces attacked Russian vehicles thanks to a tip on Telegram, officials said Tuesday. The vehicles were targeted outside Kyiv, according to the Security Service of Ukraine. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has intensified as Russian troops reportedly shell civilian areas. Ukrainian forces successfully attacked Russian vehicles in the capital city of Kyiv thanks to a public tip made through the encrypted messaging app Telegram, Ukraine's top law enforcement agency said on Tuesday. The Security Service of Ukraine said in a tweet that it was able to effectively target Russian convoys near Kyiv through messages sent to an official Telegram bot account called ""STOP Russian War."" ""Your messages about the movement of the enemy through the official chatbot … bring new trophies every day,"" the government agency tweeted. It added, ""This time we received the coordinates of enemy vehicles marked 'V' in Kyiv region."" ""The result is on this photo: fiery 'greetings' to the invaders,"" Security Service of Ukraine posted, along with a photo showing several military vehicles among plumes of black smoke. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the early morning hours of February 24, targeting several key cities with military strikes. Ukrainian forces have since put up a strong resistance to the Russian troops amid the war that has already left hundreds of Ukrainian civilians, including children, dead. Ukrainian and international officials have accused Russia of targeting civilian populations with shelling and bombardments. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video message on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces ""destroy the invaders wherever we can."" But he said Russian troops ""still have enough machinery to kill."" ""There are still enough missiles for terror,"" he added.
