2/26/2022,"With Russia’s attack on Ukraine at the forefront of the current news flow, Covid has been put on the backburner for now. That said, as has been proven before with the emergence of new variants, it is still too early to say with certainty the pandemic is finally behind us. In any case, over the long run, in similar fashion to the flu, annual boosters to protect against Covid will be required. So, there is still room for Covid-19 vaccine makers to make their mark, which bodes well for one of the leading coronavirus stocks – Novavax (NVAX), as noted by Jefferies’ Roger Song. “NVAX’s CV19 vaccine has high efficacy/immunogenicity and clean safety/ tolerability, as well as convenient logistics and well-validated protein-based technology,” the analyst said. “As a result, we believe it could play a meaningful role in the future CV19 vaccine market.” That “impressive” clinical profile of NVX-CoV2373 stands up well against the two leading mRNA-based vaccines. Technical advantages, like the undemanding shipping/storage requirements are a plus and so is the “well-validated/common” technology, which could be appealing for those with “vaccine hesitancy.” So far, the vaccine has been authorized for use by more than 30 countries/institutes, including the EU, UK and the WHO. And there’s a big catalyst on the horizon with the company awaiting a regulatory decision from the US. Following several delays, the company finally requested an EUA in January. Another catalyst could be provided by “indication expansions,” with the company overseeing clinical studies including booster, pediatric, Omicron-specific, and combo. As far as revenues are concerned, assuming a “reasonable share” in the anticipated ~4-5.5 billion of global delivery doses, Song estimates sales of around $4.6 billion based on ~910 million doses in 2022. Taking into account flu-like annual booster/re-vaccination rates, over the long run, Song sees sustained sales of around ~$2.5-4.5 billion. So, what does this all mean for investors? Song assumed coverage with a Buy rating and $198 price target, suggesting shares will climb 148% higher over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Song’s track record, click here) The Street’s average target is even more bullish than Song will allow; the figure clocks in at $215, and should it be met, investors will be sitting on 12-months returns of 169%. Rating wise, barring one skeptic, all 5 other reviews are positive, providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating.

2/26/2022,"By Jody Godoy NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday permanently barred former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli from serving as an officer or director of publicly traded companies, and ordered him to pay a $1.39 million fine for violating securities law between 2009 and 2014. U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn issued her ruling in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's civil case alleging Shkreli defrauded investors in his hedge funds and raided his biotechnology company, Retrophin Inc, for funds to settle with investors. Shkreli had proposed a 10-year officer and director ban, arguing that his seven-year prison sentence and $7.8 million in forfeiture and penalties in his related criminal case were sufficient punishment. A lawyer for Shkreli did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Shkreli became notorious and known as ""Pharma Bro"" in 2015, when he raised the price of the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim overnight to $750 per tablet from $17.50 while serving as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, later renamed Vyera Pharmaceuticals. He was arrested that year on fraud and conspiracy charges connected to Retrophin and his MSMB Capital Management and MSMB Healthcare Management hedge funds. In her decision, Matsumoto called Shkreli a ""chaotic, dishonest, and untrustworthy corporate leader"" who would likely violate the law again if allowed to run a public company. Shkreli is serving his sentence at a low-security prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania, and will be eligible for release in November. Last month, a federal judge in Manhattan barred Shkreli from the drug industry for life and ordered him to pay $64.6 million. That followed a nonjury trial where federal and state regulators claimed Shkreli tried to maintain an illegal monopoly over Daraprim and keep generic rivals off the market.
