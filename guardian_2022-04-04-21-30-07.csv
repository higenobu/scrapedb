4/4/2022,"June Brown, the actor best known for portraying Dot Cotton in the BBC soap EastEnders, has died at 95. Brown, who played the chainsmoking Christian and Walford stalwart between 1985 and 1993 and then from 1997 onwards, died on Sunday, according to the BBC. Brown was born in Needham Market, Suffolk, in 1927 and was one of five children. She served in the Women’s Royal Naval Service during the second world war, before training as an actor at London’s Old Vic Theatre School. Early TV roles included appearances on Coronation Street, Doctor Who and Play For Today, before she joined the longrunning soap on the recommendation of Leslie Grantham, who played Den Watts. Originally appearing as an Albert Square gossipmonger, the character – later known as Dot Branning – developed over time to become a beloved part of the serial’s furniture. As Cotton, Brown also became a touchstone of British popular culture, with her distinctive ‘Italian boy’ hairstyle, strong Christian beliefs and penchant for smoking. As well as instantly recognisable, Brown’s portrayal was widely praised; in 2008, she became the first soap cast member to have an episode entirely dedicated to them, with the character dictating her life for on-screen husband Jim, played by John Barden, who had had a stroke in the programme. In 2018, Brown told the Radio Times she believed she would die “fairly soon”, and therefore saw no reason to give up drinking and smoking. She also commented on eschewing modern technology in favour of watching David Attenborough documentaries, the news and the ITV daytime show Loose Women. In 2015, Brown revealed she had been diagnosed with the sight condition macular degeneration, with the soap later introducing a storyline in which Cotton also suffered from deteriorating vision. Brown is survived by her six children from her marriage to her second husband Robert Arnold, who died in 2003.",Arts/Television & radio,"June Brown, EastEnders’ Dot Cotton, dies aged 95",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/04/june-brown-who-played-dot-cotton-in-eastenders-death
4/4/2022,"There’s nothing the Grammys like more than classiness. Many of the albums and songs to have won the top prizes have been ones that are handsomely, rather than raggedly, made; emotionally forthright but keeping themselves in check. And so it proved at the 2022 ceremony, where strong work of great classiness by Silk Sonic, Jon Batiste and Olivia Rodrigo secured the big prizes. Silk Sonic’s Leave the Door Open is a very deserved winner of four awards, for record and song of the year, plus R&B performance and R&B song (the latter shared with Jazmine Sullivan, also the rightful winner of R&B album). With its immaculate session musicianship and vocal harmonising, it seems to be in conversation with R&B itself, lampooning the earnest lust of the late 70s and 80s iteration of the genre but not mocking it. There is a kind of sketch comedy detail to the way Anderson Paak makes sure all the bases are covered to seal the romantic deal, proffering fillet steaks and marijuana – but without such sumptuous songwriting it would have risked coming off as a Lonely Island-type parody. These wins mean Paak’s Silk Sonic partner Bruno Mars is now a 14-time winner, and Mars is perhaps the very vision of what the Recording Academy loves: technically brilliant, in tune with history and alive to love and sex without being threateningly erotic. Jon Batiste is another person who is consciously riffing on musical history, creating a genre-spanning overview of Black American culture with We Are, which won album of the year (he also won four other awards). At times I found this album corny, like a Disney ride around jazz and hip-hop where you have to keep your hands very much inside the car – but there are some affecting moments such as the finely etched memories on Boy Hood, and his ambition, positivity and humanity cast a halo around even the more generic songs. Olivia Rodrigo’s three wins in her breakout year included best new artist and best pop solo performance for the year’s best power ballad, Drivers License. Like the aforementioned winners, she can really sell a tune, and this isn’t faint praise. There is something actorly about her delivery – even on bedroom-trashing pop-punk songs – but she is so convincingly angry and hurt that she lifts pop into psychodrama, though still in a very family-friendly way (an F-bomb notwithstanding). You could argue that artists with messier emotions and less contained artistry got shut out, such as Lil Nas X, whose variously waspish and self-lacerating album Montero was as good as pop music gets. Likewise Billie Eilish and her riveting portrait of corroded youth, Happier Than Ever, although perhaps voters consciously heeded her cringe at fame and indeed the very public lens that the Grammys puts its winners under. But Doja Cat, who could have been too purely vivacious for the Academy, thankfully won best pop duo/group performance with her determinedly horny song Kiss Me More featuring SZA. In recent days, she has spoken of wanting to retire – here’s hoping she can find a way to thrive through the chaos of pop, as she has the kind of joie de vivre that makes it worth turning on the radio. Foo Fighters swept the rock categories, and while this wasn’t a sentimental choice – voting has closed before drummer Taylor Hawkins’ death in March – it did end up feeling apt: Hawkins’ spirited playing was the very essence of the genre. Another deserved winner was Baby Keem, who won the best rap performance alongside Kendrick Lamar: a boisterous 21-year-old memelord whose command of both melody and distinct metre is startling. Of course, classiness was notably absent in other areas. Some will have been discomfited by Kanye West’s two wins in other rap categories in the wake of an ugly barrage against ex-wife Kim Kardashian and boyfriend Pete Davidson – the post-divorce poignancy of his Grammy-nominated album Donda soured when he brought it outside the music and under the glare of social media. Ultimately, the Donda material is underrated and his winning songs are compelling – Jail’s fanfare of distortion is a wonderfully grand statement (and brings Jay-Z up to 24 wins overall) and Hurricane benefits from one of the Weeknd’s loveliest vocal melodies – and the voting cutoff was before West’s most sustained hounding of Kardashian. The Academy’s starker ethical failure is in awarding Louis CK with best comedy album. In 2017, CK was accused by numerous women of sexual harassment, and he admitted to the allegations that he had masturbated in front of them. His Sincerely Louis CK comedy special may have its merits, and there is a ruthlessly punitive bent to our culture which denies that people can be rehabilitated and better themselves. But the Grammys carry greater meaning than “this was the best comedy album this year”, while also, in their win-lose binary, stripping out any complexity. Honouring CK ultimately sends the message that sexual harassers need not worry about their misdeeds, as a few years later they’ll be back to the very top of the US cultural tree. It is a bad call in a Grammys year that made a lot of the right ones.",Arts/Music,The 2022 Grammys got behind the classiest of artists … and the least,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/04/the-grammys-get-behind-pop-classiest-artists-silk-sonic-jon-batiste-olivia-rodrigo-louis-ck
4/4/2022,"Donald Trump has endorsed the former governor and vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin for the vacant congressional seat in Alaska. “Sarah shocked many when she endorsed me very early in 2016, and we won big,” the former president said in a statement on Sunday night. “Now, it’s my turn! Sarah has been a champion for Alaska values, Alaska energy, Alaska jobs and the great people of Alaska.” In 2016, Palin was the first current or former state office holder to endorse Trump. She announced her own run on Friday. The Alaska House seat is open after the death of Don Young, the Republican who held it for nearly 50 years. An open primary will pit more than 50 contenders from all parties against each other. Palin rose to fame when John McCain made her his surprise pick for vice-president in the 2008 election. The Alaska governor proved popular with the Republican base but struggled with the demands of the role and a fierce media spotlight. McCain and Palin were soundly beaten by Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Palin maintained a presence on the hard Republican right through the emergence of the Tea Party movement against Obama and then Trump’s rise to power. After appearances on reality TV, the former governor returned to the political spotlight recently when she sued the New York Times for defamation, and lost. Last month, Palin told Fox News America needed “people like Donald Trump, who has nothing to lose, like me. We’ve got nothing to lose and no more of this vanilla milquetoast, namby-pamby, wussy-pussy stuff that’s been going on”. On Friday, announcing her run for Congress, she said: “America is at a tipping point. As I’ve watched the far left destroy the country, I knew I had to step up and join the fight.” Trump’s endorsement remains prized in Republican circles although some have come to doubt its potency in every race. Last month, Trump withdrew an endorsement of Mo Brooks, a congressman seeking a Senate seat in Alabama. The two men ostensibly fell out over Trump’s demands that Brooks help “rescind” the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Joe Biden. Critics also pointed to Brooks’s poor polling. Some Republicans reportedly fear Trump’s fixation on past battles and slights could damage their chances of retaking Congress in November. In his statement in support of Palin, Trump took a shot at McCain – a Republican grandee who never bent the knee, but who died in 2018. “Sarah lifted the McCain presidential campaign out of the dumps,” he said, “despite the fact that she had to endure some very evil, stupid, and jealous people within the campaign itself. “They were out to destroy her, but she didn’t let that happen. Sarah Palin is tough and smart and will never back down.”",News/US news,Trump endorses Sarah Palin for Alaska US House seat,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/04/donald-trump-endorses-sarah-palin-alaska-elections

As the fat melts, an exquisite flavour works its way into every bit of a sauce or dish, giving body, silkiness and essential vitamins and minerals. It’s also affordable and versatile, and at home in all sorts of dishes, from Italian meatballs to Thai stir-fries and spiced flatbreads. Buy mince with a high ratio of fat from a butcher you trust, and witness how it transforms a meal. Gentle spicing and the flavours of bay and oregano give this simple dish a beautiful nuance.

Season the lamb, then, once the oil is sizzling, fry it in two batches until golden. Scoop into a bowl and set aside. Return the pan to the heat and add the onion, garlic and spices. Season well, and sweat for eight to 10 minutes, until the onion is translucent and soft. Stir in the lamb, herbs and wine, and bring up to a simmer. Cook briskly for three to four minutes, to reduce the wine, then stir in the tomatoes and simmer gently for 30 minutes, until the sauce is thick. Check the seasoning. Stir in the orzo, then pour in enough water to cover by 2cm – you’ll need about 500ml. Stir again, cover, turn the heat down low and cook for 15 minutes, until the orzo is just tender and has absorbed most of the liquid. Remove the lid, sprinkle over the parsley and feta, and serve with crusty bread. Stir cooked butter beans into the richly spiced tomato sauce instead of the lamb mince.

4/4/2022,"The world’s loneliest whale was discovered in 1989 when his mating call was picked up by US Navy underwater surveillance designed to detect Russian submarines. The frequency of the whale’s singing, at 52Hz, was much higher than other large whales. Was this guy the first of his kind, or the last? Could other whales understand him, or was the 52 a lonesome wanderer, crossing the ocean looking for love, singing into the darkness? The story went viral in 2004 after an article in the New York Times, inspiring hashtags – #TheSaddestThingEver! – and back tattoos. Now comes this documentary, directed by Joshua Zeman and executive produced by Leonardo DiCaprio (he’s much easier to find than the whale, frequently sighted onboard a yacht with a supermodel). Zeman charters a boat called Truth and assembles a crack team of oceanographers to solve the mystery of the 52. Spotting the whale will be harder than looking for a needle in a haystack, warns one of the experts – and this is a film raised a fair few notches by the wonder of geekery, the absolute joy of seeing scientists living and breathing their work. It’s no spoiler to say that a feeling of anticlimax is here from the start – though to be fair to Zeman, he does get a bombshell at the end. Before that, he fills out his film with some interesting backstory: beginning with a brief history of whaling, and including an upsetting sequence showing how noise from container ships in the Pacific interferes with whales’ ability to communicate, creating an entire ocean of lonely whales. Best of all is an interview with the environmentalist Roger Payne, whose hit 1970 album Songs of the Humpback Whale taught us how to love the whale. As he says: nobody cared about saving the whale until they realised whales can sing. Still, if the 52 is watching the message is loud and clear: stay the hell away from humans.

4/4/2022,"Ian [Dench, guitarist] was the genius behind Unbelievable. I just sang and looked pretty. Derry [Brownson, sampler], Zac [Foley, bass] and I had the idea for EMF, but we didn’t have much direction. We’d just go to Cinderford village hall and muck about dressing up in jumble sale clothes. I worked in a music shop and had got to know Ian. He was a bit older, part of the Gloucester scene and had experience of writing songs in bands. We had the name EMF, which stands for Epsom Mad Funkers – which was how David Quantick, writing in NME, had described New Order fans, and we adored New Order – but no songs. We’d sit around Ian’s mum’s piano with this really primitive synthesiser and wrote the 10 songs that ended up on Schubert Dip. I said “I want to be Chicago house, Detroit techno” but Ian pulled us back into crossover indie/dance. Ian had Unbelievable pretty well formed: there’s the tale he tells of the melody coming into his head as he was riding on his bike. I was really inexperienced, and on the original four-track demo, my vocals are even more camp and throwaway than on the single. We were in our late teens and thought we were invincible. The record labels invited us to London but we got them to come to us to witness the mayhem of this little scene we’d created in the Forest of Dean. People were literally climbing through the pub windows trying to get in to our gigs. Before we knew it, Virgin, Island and EMI were offering us big bucks. We looked to American hip-hop for fashion, and we used our first advance to buy really big dodgy puffer jackets like East 17. Unbelievable is 30 years old, but it certainly hasn’t gone away. It was used in a terrible advert for Kraft Crumbles – this cheesy pie topping – with the lyrics: “They’re crumbelievable.” We got in a major battle with Asda – who wanted to use it – and finally we said “Yes, but only if you take out the Adsa-price slap on the bottom”, and they gave up. It’s hard to cover because it’s such a slow tempo. The judges tried on The Voice – I nearly choked on my cup of tea when I saw will.i.am trying to do my rap. I’m still making music – I’m still a West Country raver at heart. I envisaged living off my royalties but 10 or so years ago I retrained as a secondary school teacher. None of the kids I teach have even heard of EMF, but being asked to sign autographs at parents’ evening can get a bit weird. My mother thought I’d ruined my life because I’d dropped out of studying fine art at Oxford University and I was living in this grotty Gloucester bedsit in the street – as I later discovered – next to Fred West, the serial killer. My previous band, Apple Mosaic, had come to nothing in eight years. I had said to the singer: “Shall we work on some more songs?” and he said: “No, I’ve got to make my girlfriend’s dinner,” and that was it. I went to see my girlfriend at Cardiff University and she dumped me because she thought I was such a loser. I hitched a lift home and the lorry dropped me on the M50. I remembered this cool kid called James that I’d met at Glos Music Co, who had kept saying: “You should come to the Forest of Dean. We’ve got this great band. We wear Afghan coats and play death metal.” I phoned him from a call box, 10 minutes later he arrived with Zac, we went out and got drunk and I didn’t go home for three days. They had the name – EMF – but no songs, so I said: “We’d better write some.” One day, I was riding my bike home, still obsessed with this girl who had dumped me, and the idea just came to me: “The things you say / Your purple prose just gives you away / The things you say / You’re unbelievable.” My dad was a classical guitarist, so I’d learned classical guitar and also loved the blues. The guitar riff goes from blues mode to flamenco mode, like the two conflicting sides of my life. Samples were all the rage, and the “Oh” is a sample of this misogynistic US comedian called Andrew Dice Clay that was weirdly released on Def Jam, but we couldn’t get hold of anyone in the Def Jam office to clear it. We were flown out to Los Angeles to meet EMI and I happened to see Rick Rubin, the founder of Def Jam, sitting in the Rainbow Bar and Grill on Sunset. I asked if he’d clear the sample, he said: “Fax my office in the morning” and he did it for free. Unbelievable only went to No 3 in the UK although it did go to No 1 in the US. I’m still a songwriter for hire. I co-wrote Beautiful Liar for Beyoncé and Shakira, so finally I’ve had a No 1 here.

4/4/2022,"A scheme to reintroduce brown bears to the Pyrenees is showing signs of success, with 70 individuals identified in 2021, the highest number for a century. The population has increased from 52 in 2018, according to figures produced by the cross-border group that monitors the bears in France and Spain, with half the creatures living in the Catalan Pyrenean regions of Vall d’Aran, Pallars Sobirà and Alta Ribagorça. Overall, the population is thinly spread over an area of 6,500 sq km. The study identified 34 females, 32 males and four others whose gender was not determined, with 15 pups born over the course of last year. There have been a 114 newborns since the scheme was launched in 1996. The brown bear was near extinct in the Pyrenees when three bears from Slovenia were introduced 26 years ago. The last native specimen was shot in 2004 and two years later four females were introduced, also from Slovenia. Up until 2016, all the cubs born since 1997 could be traced back to Pyros, a Slovenian male bear. Another male, nicknamed Goiat (the lad), introduced from Slovenia in 2016, was accused last year of killing livestock in the region. A ram, four goats and a sheep were killed in separate attacks last autumn in the Vall d’Aran. Goiat had already acquired notoriety across the border in France where farmers were calling for his removal. He is now known to be in Catalonia where he fathered at least one cub last year. The repopulation scheme was opposed by farmers from the start, even though brown bears’ diet is largely vegetarian and they rarely kill for food. There was a similar outcry last year when the Spanish government banned the hunting of wolves in the north-western regions of Castilla y León and Galicia, where they are most populous. Farmers in the region say wolves kill hundreds of their livestock every year, although they can claim compensation for any animal killed. The EU-backed Franco-Spanish LoupO project was established in 2020 to coordinate the monitoring of the brown bear and wolf populations in the Pyrenees.",News/Environment,"Brown bear population in Pyrenees highest for a century, says study",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/brown-bear-population-pyrenees-highest-century-says-study
4/4/2022,"Easter holidaymakers and lorry drivers travelling to mainland Europe faced further delays on Monday on the chaotic cross-Channel route after a Eurotunnel Le Shuttle train broke down in the tunnel. The breakdown came as Eurotunnel said it was experiencing more traffic than it had since 2019, at the start of the first school holidays since UK Covid travel rules were scrapped. Cross-Channel passengers and freight have also been switching to Eurotunnel because several ferries have been out of service since the P&O Ferries sackings crisis. Eurotunnel detected a safety problem on a freight-only train heading to Calais, which had to be repaired in the tunnel before being taken back to Folkestone, blocking one of the two tunnels. Passenger and freight shuttles continued to run in batches of departures in each direction, reducing capacity and causing minor delays to Eurostar services. There were three-hour queues for drivers waiting to board Eurotunnel in the UK, while delays in Calais were about an hour. Eurotunnel said it expected to have services running at full capacity by Monday afternoon. The incident came with cross-Channel transport services already under intense pressure, following the suspension of P&O Ferries after it fired 800 crew without notice two weeks ago. One of its ships on the Dover-Calais route, the Pride of Kent, failed a subsequent safety inspection, and services on the short crossing are not expected to restart for several days, at the earliest. Capacity was further reduced last week when storms temporarily stopped all ferry sailings and a DFDS vessel was taken out of service after a minor incident. The firm had been carrying rebooked P&O Ferries customers. With traffic increased by leisure passengers at the start of the Easter holidays, roads into Dover were gridlocked on Friday. Operation Brock, the emergency contraflow system introduced for Brexit to deal with queueing lorries slowed by red tape at the border, was put in place but lifted on Sunday night as traffic eased. A Eurotunnel spokesperson said: “As a result of a technical issue with a freight shuttle overnight, Eurotunnel is currently operating a reduced service. “We apologise to customers who may experience some delays during this incident and would like to assure everyone that we are working as fast as possible to remove the train from the tunnel and to restore normal service. “We expect to have full services running again later in the day.”",News/Business,Eurotunnel train breakdown causes further travel chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/04/eurotunnel-train-breakdown-causes-further-travel-chaos
4/4/2022,"Joe Biden called Rupert Murdoch “the most dangerous man in the world”, according to a forthcoming book. The comment, from mid-2021, is reported in This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America’s Future by Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns, two New York Times reporters. The book is due out in May. Last month, Politico reported passages in which Jill Biden, now the first lady, is critical of her husband’s decision to pick Kamala Harris as his running mate. Reporting Biden’s remark about Murdoch, CNN said the president had never spoken in public about the 91-year-old media baron and Fox News owner. The president did tell a town hall audience he sometimes “turn[s] on Fox to find out how popular I am”. He also apologised to a Fox News White House reporter, Peter Doocy, for calling him a “stupid son of a bitch”. According to Burns and Martin, Biden “assessed” Murdoch to be “one of the most destructive forces in the United States”. Fox News anchors including Tucker Carlson, have prominently relayed coronavirus misinformation and spoken favorably of Vladimir Putin and Russia. The network has been sued for giving voice to Donald Trump’s lies about electoral fraud in his defeat by Biden, who is now a target for daily ridicule by Fox News hosts. The White House and Fox News did not immediately comment. Fox News is broadly supportive of Trump. But Murdoch has clashed with the former president. In January 2018, the author Michael Wolff reported that Murdoch, a US citizen born in Australia, called Trump a “fucking idiot” over his views on immigration. Last year, Wolff reported that Murdoch personally approved Fox News’ call of Arizona for Biden, a decision that indicated Trump would lose his re-election fight. Fox News denied it. Wolff told Brian Stelter, the CNN host who on Sunday revealed Biden’s comment about Murdoch, that Murdoch “hates Donald Trump. Hates him – but Rupert loves money”. Stelter is the author of a book of his own, Hoax: Donald Trump, Fox News and the Dangerous Distortion of Truth, published in 2020. As the Guardian reported, the book reports that Trump’s second attorney general, William Barr, told Murdoch a Fox News personality critical of Trump should be “muzzled”.",News/US news,"Biden finds Murdoch ‘most dangerous man in the world’, new book says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/04/joe-biden-rupert-murdoch-fox-news-new-book
4/4/2022,"As Covid restrictions begin to ease at last, Borussia Dortmund’s first home sell-out in more than two years was sight to behold. It was something that RB Leipzig’s Domenico Tedesco was keen to pre-warn his young side about – although as he later pointed out in an ESPN interview, it was something the home players were not used to experiencing recently either. The bitter disappointment for most of those in Westfalen on Saturday evening was that while the colour returned to the stands, it was the same old, same old on the pitch. Leipzig coasted to a 4-1 victory after a testing initial 20 minutes, and Tedesco was happy to explain just how his midfield and forwards were able to surge unperturbed towards a prone BVB defence. Tedesco has brought gloom to this arena before – he was the Schalke coach when they recovered from a 4-0 half-time deficit to take home a point in a memorable Revierderby in November 2017 which accelerated the fall of the then-Dortmund head coach, Peter Bosz. That, though, was different, a shocking punch to the gut. This felt sadly inevitable. The last time BVB lost two Bundesliga games by a three-goal margin at home in the same season was in 1990-91, when they finished 10th. They have now lost two games by that distance in this calendar year – both at home and both to rivals, in Leverkusen and now Leipzig. Both the visitors could have scored more. Rarely can a team so assured of second place – even now, with a reduced six-point cushion, the runners-up spot will be theirs barring a quite extraordinary collapse – so frequently underwhelm. “I think we played a good first half,” argued Manuel Akanji after the game. “Except for the goals we gave them.” That is a pretty big caveat, but one that sums up Dortmund’s season. We know they are capable of the sublime, but there are far too many individual moments and far too little group cohesion – as has been the case for a while. The same returning fans who gave their players “goosebumps” (in Akanji’s words) with their vociferous support booed in some areas of the stadium, and there were even a smattering of chants for Marco Rose to go. The former Gladbach coach will probably get his second season, with a huge injury list and an unevenly built squad not doing him any favours. Instead, it will be the job of the incoming sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, to implement what appears more and more likely to be a sweeping programme of reform. That includes rebuilding the defence around the incoming Niklas Süle and getting rid of the increasingly labouring old heads like Marco Reus and Mats Hummels, whom Kehl played alongside. That this latest undressing was in front of a full house hurt, but that it was administered by Leipzig was even worse for Westfalen. It would be unfair to say the rest of the Bundesliga’s supporters have forgotten where Leipzig have come from, or even that they have come close to accepting them – but distaste for the model is at least as strong in Dortmund as it is anywhere else. The protests – and some less savoury behaviour around the ground – on Leipzig’s first visit in 2017 landed BVB with a huge fine and partial stadium closure. The banner in the Südtribune on Sunday which proclaimed “Trotz Pandemie bleibt ihr die größte Seuche der liga” – despite the pandemic, you remain the biggest plague in the league – underlined the fact that those feelings remain. If the flashing warning signs are not heeded by those at the Dortmund helm, those fans might have to get used to a more permanent reordering of the hierarchy seeking to tug at Bayern’s coattails. Arminia Bielefeld 1-1 Stuttgart, Augsburg 3-0 Wolfsburg, Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 Hertha Berlin, Borussia Dortmund 1-4 RB Leipzig, Borussia Mönchengladbach 1-1 Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt 0-0 Greuther Fürth, Freiburg 1-4 Bayern Munich, Hoffenheim 1-2 Bochum, Union Berlin 1-0 Cologne  It was all about the substitutes in the Black Forest as Bayern Munich won 4-1, with perennial super-sub Nils Pedersen initially equalising for Freiburg 17 seconds after coming on, before Serge Gnabry regained Bayern’s lead 33 seconds after his own entrance. The big news was the change that (initially) didn’t happen, though. After a double substitution by the visitors saw two go on but only one come off, Freiburg’s Nico Schlotterbeck informed the referee, Christian Dingert, that Bayern had 12 men on the pitch for some 20 seconds. “If I didn’t tell him, I don’t think he sees it at all,” said the young Germany centre-back. The confusion was caused by an error on the Bayern bench, with Kingsley Coman supposed to be withdrawn but the number 29 – the winger’s old number – raised rather than his current No 11. The game was then held up for eight minutes with Bayern already leading 3-1 as Dingert, his assistants and VAR verified exactly what had happened. The picture was further obscured by Corentin Tolisso – the only one of the two intended players who actually had gone off) nipping to the toilet, according to Julian Nagelsmann. His opposite number Christian Streich played down the suggestion that Freiburg might appeal to have the game replayed. After all, who would want to play Bayern more times than they had to?  There were few grounds in which the return of fans was felt quite like it was in Köpenick, where Union Berlin opened the weekend with a single-goal win over Köln on Friday night. The locals got what they came for, not just in terms of the communal experience but on the pitch too, with Taiwo Awoniyi snaffling up an errant Jonas Hector backpass to score the decider and become Union’s top Bundesliga scorer of all time. “We’re now at 41 points,” said the coach, Urs Fischer, who might tentatively start to look up towards another European qualification. “It’s a joyful evening,”  At the bottom, Arminia Bielefeld leapfrogged Hertha – who paid for a slow start in a 2-1 reverse at Leverkusen – into the relegation playoff spot by snatching a 1-1 draw with Stuttgart in the weekend’s big basement battle. Florian Krüger’s smart back-post finish earned a point after the visitors had led via Sasa Kalajdzic and missed a host of chances to extend their lead. “It’s two points dropped,” lamented Stuttgart’s coach, Pellegrino Matarazzo, though he emphasised that the health of Arminia’s Fabian Klos was the main thing. Klos suffered a “serious head injury”, per the club, in a stoppage-time collision with his own teammate, Alessandro Schöpf.

4/4/2022,"In recent years, the internet has become the venue for a general collapse in trust. Trolling, fake news and “doing your own research” have become such a part of public discourse, it’s sometimes easy to imagine that all the online revolution has brought us is a myriad of new ways to be confused about the world. Social media has played a particularly significant role in the spread of disinformation. Malicious state enterprises such as the notorious Russian “troll farm” are part of this, certainly. But there is a more powerful mechanism: the way it brings together people, whether flat earthers or anti-vaxxers, who would find it difficult to meet like-minded folks in the real world. Today, if you’re convinced our planet isn’t round, you don’t have to resort to standing on street corners with a sign, shouting at passersby. Instead you have access to an online community of tens of thousands of individuals producing content that not only tells you you’re right, but also builds a web of pseudo-knowledge you can draw from any time you feel your beliefs are being challenged. The same kinds of “counterfactual communities” arise around any topic that attracts enough general interest. I’ve witnessed this myself over the past decade while looking into war crimes in Syria, Covid-19 disinformation and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Why do counterfactual communities form? A key factor is distrust in mainstream authority. For some, this is partly a reaction to the UK and US government’s fabrications in the buildup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Sometimes, it stems from a sense of injustice around the Israel-Palestine conflict. These are of course legitimate positions, and are not by themselves indicative of a tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. But a pervasive sense of distrust can make you more vulnerable to slipping down the rabbit hole. One way of looking at this is that government deception or hypocrisy has caused a form of moral injury. As with the proverb “once bitten, twice shy”, that injury can result in a kneejerk rejection of anyone perceived as being on the side of the establishment. This creates a problem for traditional approaches to combatting disinformation, such as the top-down factcheck, which might be provided by a mainstream media outlet or some other organisation. More often than not, this will be discredited, dismissed with: “They would say that, wouldn’t they?” Factchecking outfits may do good work, but they are missing a crucial component: the power of the crowd. Because, as well as counterfactual communities, we’ve also seen what you might call truth-seeking communities emerge around specific issues. These are the internet users who want to inform themselves while guarding against manipulation by others, or being misled by their own preconceptions.checking themselves. tOnce established, hey will not only share and propagate factchecks in a way that lends them credibility, but often conduct the process of fact What’s important about these communities is that they react quickly to information being put out by various actors, including states. In 2017 the Russian ministry of defence published images on social media that it claimed showed evidence of US forces assisting Islamic State in the Middle East. Huge if true – except it was instantly debunked when social media users realised within seconds that the Russian MoD had used screenshots from a computer game. I would go as far as to say that internet users who are heavily engaged with particular topics are our strongest defence against disinformation. At Bellingcat, a collective of researchers, investigators and citizen journalists I founded in 2014, we’ve seen this play out in real time during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Our investigation of the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine helped create a community focused on the conflict there that uses open source techniques to examine, verify and debunk a myriad of information. In the weeks leading up to the Russian invasion, members started gathering videos and photographs of Russian troop movements that forewarned of the planned attack, and proactively debunked disinformation being spread by separatists, including a supposed IED attack posed with bodies that were shown to have already been autopsied before they arrived at the scene. After the invasion got under way, many of the same people helped collect and geolocate videos and photographs, including images of potential war crimes, that Bellingcat and its partners have been verifying and archiving for possible use in future accountability processes. These contributions, on the face of them disjointed and chaotic, have saved our verification team vast amounts of time. But how do you grow and nurture what are essentially decentralised, self-organised, ad hoc groups like this? Our approach has been to engage with them, creating links from their useful social media posts to our publications (all thoroughly factchecked by our team), and crediting them for their efforts. We also create guides and case studies so that anyone who is inspired to give it a go themselves has the opportunity to learn how to do it. But there’s more to do than simply waiting for crowds of investigators to emerge and hoping they’re interested in the same things we are. We must take a broader approach. The answer lies in creating a society that’s not only resilient against disinformation, but has the tools to actively contribute to efforts towards transparency and accountability. For example, digital media literacy charity The Student View has been going into schools and showing 16- to 18-year-olds how to use investigation techniques to look into issues affecting them. In one case, students in Bradford used freedom of information requests to uncover the unusually large number of high speed police chases in their areas. Teaching young people how to engage positively with issues they face and then expanding this work into online investigation is not only empowering, it gives them skills they can use throughout their lives. This is not about turning every 16- to 18-year-old into a journalist, police officer, or human rights investigator, but giving them tools they can use to contribute, in however small a way, to the fight against disinformation. In their home towns, in conflicts such as Ukraine, and in the wider world – they really can make a difference.

4/4/2022,"The billionaire Elon Musk has taken an almost $3bn (£2.3bn) stake in Twitter to become the social media platform’s largest shareholder. The world’s richest man, who has a penchant for eccentric behaviour frequently involving posts on Twitter, has built up a 9.2% stake in Twitter, according to filings made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday. The maverick boss of Tesla and SpaceX, who with more than 80 million followers ranks in the top 10 most popular Twitter users globally, paid $2.89bn for the stake at Twitter’s closing share price on Friday. Shares in the microblogging site soared as much as 26% in pre-market trading on the back of the news, adding more than $8bn to the $31.5bn market value of Twitter before Musk’s interest was made public. After the stock price jump Musk’s shares are now worth about $3.6bn. Musk, who just last week said that he was “giving serious thought” to building his own social media platform, now holds a stake more than four times the 2.25% holding of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. The 50-year-old – who has a personal fortune estimated at $289bn, almost $100bn more than the world’s next richest person, the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos – has often found himself in trouble for contentious remarks he has made on Twitter. Analysts believe that the shareholding taken by Musk, who has been highly critical of Twitter, is likely to see him take an active interest in the microblogging site that could lead to a buy out. “We would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.",News/Technology,Elon Musk buys $2.9bn stake in Twitter,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/04/elon-musk-buys-stake-twitter-share-tesla-spacex
4/4/2022,"The New South Wales police force is falling behind other states in its efforts to curb domestic violence and needs to implement systems to support work on the frontline, according to the state’s auditor general Margaret Crawford. An audit report released on Monday also found the system used to record and manage domestic violence incidents was “cumbersome”, and so “onerous” that police had even less time to deal with rising rates of domestic violence. Crawford said the computer system – slated for replacement in four years – needed to be improved so that “related events and individuals are automatically connected” to help improve outcomes. The auditor-general also said that while the force had “implemented initiatives to improve domestic violence policing”, it had not provided enough centralised policy resources to support them, nor sufficient reviews to work out what was and was not working. Just six dedicated domestic and family violence policing policy staff were expected to support 280 domestic violence specialists and advise about 12,000 police officers across the state on the complex issues. “The NSW police force has not dedicated the same level of resources or organisational authority to domestic violence policing as other Australian jurisdictions,” the report read. “After review processes in both Victoria and Queensland, these jurisdictions established standalone domestic and family violence commands.” The auditor general also recommended a complete overhaul of the way officers investigate claims of domestic violence made against former or serving members of the force to “mitigate conflicts of interest”. Between January 2017 and April 2021, 166 complaints of domestic violence were lodged against police. About a quarter of those were sustained, either in court or warranting internal disciplinary action. NSW police respond to more than 140,000 domestic and family violence calls for assistance every year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The audit also found limited centralised workforce planning made it harder to calculate whether there were enough specialist domestic violence officers to deal with workload demands. While the force had almost doubled its domestic violence specialist workforce over the past five years, those efforts were being undermined by a lack of structural support from within the organisation, including a lack of compliance checks. The audit also found the state’s police force does not monitor the training around or aptitude in responding to domestic violence issues of the broader workforce beyond specialist officers. Routinely asking for feedback was among the key recommendations from the auditor general, alongside improvements to data collection and analysis to help meet demands. Opposition domestic violence spokesperson Jodie Harrison said the government needed to act on the recommendations. “We cannot effectively address the issue if we don’t have a clear picture of what is happening,” Harrison said. “These recommendations must be addressed to improve police response, prevent domestic and family violence and better support victim-survivors.” Domestic Violence NSW (DVNSW) interim chief executive Elise Phillips echoed those calls. “It is imperative that the NSW police force is capable of delivering a consistent response so that victim-survivors feel safe and confident to call police seeking help,” she said. A DVNSW report looking at the experience of specialist domestic and family violence services across the state will say that “policing is inconsistent across NSW”, with particular concerns for regional and remote areas, when it is released on Tuesday. It will call for more consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for cultural awareness training to be undertaken by all police officers. In a statement, NSW police said it had accepted the recommendations and had made improvements in recent years.",News/Australia news,"Resourcing for domestic violence policing in NSW lags behind other states, audit finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/resourcing-for-domestic-violence-policing-in-nsw-lags-behind-other-states-audit-finds
