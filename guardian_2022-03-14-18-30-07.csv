3/14/2022,"Allies of the Ukrainian president Voldymyr Zelenskiy say Vladimir Putin will only accept a compromise on Ukraine’s future neutrality if he is facing a credible threat to his economic power base by a rapid and permanent exclusion of Russia’s oil and gas exports from its lucrative European markets. The Russian government receives 40% of its budget revenues from energy exports. But Ukraine is meeting stubborn resistance from Germany, which insists its economy would be plunged into recession if it suddenly lost access to Russian gas and oil. In an interview reflecting the moral pressure Germany is under to do more, Germany’s Green economics minister, Robert Habeck, admitted Europe in the past had fed Ukraine false promises, but said Germany could not afford “the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs” that a full energy embargo would require. He said Germany at best could be freed of Russian coal by the autumn, of its oil by the end of the year, but could set no date for ending German reliance on gas. The impasse is leaving senior allies of Zelenskiy feeling frustrated, and appealing to the UK and the US to use the G7 to try to persuade the Germany chancellor Olaf Scholz to sign up to a western timetable to end dependence on Russian energy. Scholz and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, spoke with Putin again at the weekend. Zelenskiy’s chief negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, has said the talks between Ukraine and Russia are now virtually continuous, and have got past the stage of trading ultimatums. But the French sound less optimistic. Jean-Yves Le Drian the French foreign minister said “We are in front of a wall. The worst is ahead of us. This war will be long.” The frustration with the German position is such that Zelenskiy is willing to turn to one of Scholz’s predecessors, Gerhard Schröder, to act as a mediator with Putin. The former chancellor has accepted the role, possibly to salvage something from the ruins of his reputation, and reportedly had talks with Putin last week. Some of Zelenskiy’s team are also uneasy at the intermediary role of the Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett, questioning the depth of Israel’s support. Zelenskiy has repeatedly stressed he is willing to meet Putin to discuss new security guarantees for Ukraine in return for his country’s future neutrality, either as an alternative to membership of Nato, or as an interim measure prior to joining the defence pact. Speaking last week after his largely inconclusive talks with Sergei Lavrov in Turkey, Ukraine’s foreign minister Dymtro Kubela said “the real issue for Ukraine is security guarantees and hard security guarantees, similar to the ones that members of Nato have. We need these guarantees primarily from Russia since it is the country that committed an act of aggression against us, but also from other countries including permanent members of the UN Security Council. The idea is that we have a Treaty, an agreement where countries would oblige themselves not to commit aggression or put economic, or any other, pressure on us”. He confirmed the president had cooled down on Ukraine’s Nato application “because, despite our best efforts, Nato is not ready to integrate us. The reaction to the aggression by Nato has been to delegate to member states to deal with us on a bilateral basis”. But he added that until Ukraine knew the strength and reliability of the guarantees it was not yet ready to say the guarantees could be a substitute for Nato membership. “We are not yet in a position to abandon Nato membership”, he said. The idea is for a legally binding treaty signed by numerous countries that guarantees the security of Ukraine in a way that the Budapest Memorandum signed in 1994 failed to do. The memorandum was supposed to guarantee Ukraine’s independence in return for the country abandoning its nuclear stockpile. Britain, in the form of John Major, was one of the co-signatories. The memorandum in effect became a dead letter. Zelenskiy insists the talks are serious and no longer merely an exchange of ultimatums. The US, reflecting what it has been briefed to them by Israeli, French and Turkish intermediaries, all whom have spoken to Putin, say they have not heard any willingness by the Russian leader to compromise. “It’s hard to offer an overture when the Kremlin’s position continues to be that ‘we’ll continue to pummel Ukraine until’ it bows to maximalist demands,” a senior US official said last week. Putin’s public position is still to demand the “demilitarisation and de-nazification” of Ukraine, in effect regime change, as well as Ukrainian recognition of Crimea and of the Donbas. He thinks he is winning, the White House judges. That leads the US and UK to argue the economic endurance test between the west and Russia must continue, and be intensified, until what Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peksov oddly describes as “the hostile bacchanalia” becomes so intense that Putin finds his inner circle desert him, or even assassinate him. But Zelenskiy’s allies feel Scholz, a fortnight after Germany’s great “turning point” on defence spending, has reverted to cautious type. A delegation has been in Europe this week arguing the EU, now on its fourth sanction package, has still not taken the decisive step – a total embargo on Russian energy. Andriy Kobolyev, the former boss of Ukraine’s energy firm Naftogaz, and now spearheading an international push for comprehensive western energy sanctions on behalf of Zelenskiy, finds the German caution frustrating. He said: “Until European leaders understand Putin sees them as a weak and easy victims in his geopolitical strategy, he will continue doing what he is doing. That is why the only way to prove Putin wrong is to put on a full-scale energy embargo. Europe has to play a different game and say ‘we know we can cope without Russia’. It has to say ‘we are large economies, and with a different energy mix we can cope because for us it is a matter of principle’. It has to say ‘we are putting an end to this right now and you Russians will lose our market forever’. That poses an existential threat for Russia.” Kobolyev has negotiated with Putin and his energy barons, and insists he knows their mindset. He believes the Russian president will face their wrath, and that of the FSB security service if they feel Putin totally miscalculated not only Ukrainian resistance, but the west’s willingness to make the sacrifices to wean themselves off Russian energy, and so blow a massive long-term hole in the Russian budget. It would also upend all the assumptions of the Russian energy elite around Putin, such as Igor Sechin, the boss of Rosneft. Sechin like Putin is highly conservative on issues such as climate change. He remains convinced absolute oil consumption will increase by 10% by 2040 and by 20% in Asia. Kobolyev says it would be a complete shock to Sechin if his most profitable market just disappeared overnight. “Their sacred cash cow would have been killed.” So far only the US has said it will end oil imports, but since the US imported an average of only 209,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and 500,000 bpd of other petroleum products from Russia in 2021, it is hardly a great sacrifice. The UK has said it will join the embargo by the end of the year. But Scholz has set his face against the move. He said last week. “At the moment, Europe’s supply of energy for heat generation, mobility, power supply and industry cannot be secured in any other way. It is therefore of essential importance for the provision of public services and the daily lives of our citizens,” he added. Annalena Baerbock, the Green foreign minister has said much the same. “If we end up in a situation where nurses and teachers are not coming to work, where we have no electricity for several days. Putin will have won part of the battle, because he will have plunged other countries into chaos”. Scholz was one of a group of leaders insisted on the removal in an EU council statement of any reference to the proposed target date of 2027 for the EU to end its dependence on Russian gas. His concern is understandable. Oil accounts for 32% of German energy input, and one third of that comes from Russia. Yet oil is central to Putin’s war machine. Thane Gustafson, the chronicler of Russia’s energy sector, points out in his latest book Klimat that in 2019, the last pre-pandemic year, income from oil – worth $188bn – accounted for 44% of Russian exports in value, and gas only 12%. Hydrocarbons generates 56% of Russia’s export income and 39% of the federal budget. Kobolyev is convinced that if the EU banned Russian oil, other sources could be found. “There is a Russian proverb: a sacred place is never empty for long”, he explains. In a game of geopolitical chess with Russia, Biden is already working to find alternative oil supplies. For now he is trying to fill the shortfall through drawing on the US reserves, oil from Venezuela, the world largest oil producer, Iran and Saudi Arabia. White House officials were in Caracas for the first such talks in 20 years. Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro government has signalled its willingness to cooperate with the White House by releasing two political prisoners in a good will gesture. Venezuela’s oil output could rise by at least 400,000 bpd, the country’s petroleum chamber said on Friday. But Biden has to tread carefully since the idea of reconciliation with Maduro is leading to a reaction in Congress. Difficult talks about Saudi Arabia boosting output are continuing, according to Kobolyev. But Saudi’s weekend execution of 81 “criminals and terrorists” hardly suggests the kingdom is desperately seeking the west’s approval. The executions hardly makes a mooted visit by Boris Johnson the UK prime minister to Riyadh more likely. In the case of Iran, Russia has stepped in at the last minute to try to block Iran’s nuclear deal, fearing that an agreement, and lifting of oil sanctions on Iran, would see Tehran able to unleash as much as 2m barrels of oil per day onto the global market. To turn to the autocrats of Venezuela, Iran and to Saudi Arabia or the indeed the UAE to save the west from Putin has its ironies, but some say needs must. If Paris was worth a mass, oil, it seems, is seen as worth some diplomatic humble pie. The more complex issue is gas. As a compromise between those that favour a ban such as Poland and the Baltic States, the EU has produced a plan that sees the EU cut consumption of Russian gas by two-thirds before the end of 2022. The EU would then become independent from all Russian fossil fuels by 2027 or “well before 2030”. “By the end of this year, we can replace 100 billion cubic metres [bcm] of gas imports from Russia. That is two-thirds of what we import from them”, the EU commission said in a statement. The EU argued it can receive around 10bcm more gas from alternative pipeline suppliers such as Norway and Azerbaijan. The main bulk of this replacement would, however, come from imported liquid natural gas, which officials estimate would need to reach 50bcm of additional imports by the end of 2022, possibly via a joint, strategic EU contract, although legal details remain to be resolved. Federico Santi, a gas specialist at the consultancy Eurasia Group, said: “That is a huge figure, equivalent to around 10% of global LNG consumption in 2021.” Even so, Kobolyev is unimpressed by the lack of ambition and the lack of specific measures. He insists the EU should at least cut off sales of Russian LNG, which hits the Yamal project, with ties to the Kremlin’s siloviki mafia. He has also proposed that the revenues from Gazprom’s pipelines go into an Iran-style escrow account that will be released only once Russia calls off the invasion. Sums might be deducted to pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine. He claims Russia could not physically turn off the gas taps immediately taking Europe through to next winter. Kobolyev is no longer a lonely voice, but is finding influential support in Germany in a way that is starting to discomfort the “traffic light-coalition” government. Norbert Rottgen the CDU former chair of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee, is calling for a full ban, and says he is not sure what happened to Germany’s turning point. He says polls show voters are ahead of their leaders in being prepared to make economic sacrifices to stop funding Putin’s war machine. On 8 March, the Leopoldina National Academy of Science, and separately a group of nine international economists, mapped out how Germany could absorb an embargo, with the worst scenario a 3% fall in GDP – less than 4% impact of Covid – or probably something like a cost of €1,200 per German citizen. This figure is contested, including by Habeck, who says the impact is more likely to be 5%. Various economists, lobbyists and gas intensive industries, such as chemicals, are staking out their ground in a heated debate that blends morality, politics and economic modelling. Scholz has moved under pressure in this war once, over arms sales, Nord Stream 2 and defence spending, and there is no guarantee he will not again. But if frozen out of European markets, would Putin simply turn to China? Kobolyev says no. “The option of shifting gas sales to Chinese markets is not possible,” he says. “In the case of China it might take 10 to 15 years to build the infrastructure. The existing pipeline to China is small and is not connected to the areas currently supplying Europe. “Although exporting LNG and oil will be easier, China will know they are his last market, meaning he will lose 80% of his revenues and that is a devastating blow.” “This is about more than cents and dollars. Putin is paranoid and he would hate to become dependent on China because he is afraid China will eat them alive. Russians perceive China as their smaller brother. Russians brought communism to China, but this will be a humiliation. “So when Putin goes back to his crony friends – and this is the close KGB circle – and he tells them ‘Look guys, we have been thrown out of Europe completely, but I am trying to negotiate with China’, they are not going to appreciate that. To lose your biggest most lucrative market, to lose 80% of your revenues and become fully dependent on China, that does not look like a very smart or strategic move. That does not look like a victory. “The Russians and Putin”, he explains, “have always believed Europe can never survive without Russian oil. He thinks if he wins in Ukraine, the Kremlin will be forgiven because there is no alternative and the West is weak. That is how he thinks, it’s how Gazprom thinks and it’s how Rosneft thinks. That is how they see the world. That is why Putin personally controls the energy trade. It is his sacred cash cow.”",News/World news,Can the west slaughter Putin’s sacred cash cow?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/west-putin-sacred-cash-cow-russia-ukraine-gas
3/14/2022,"People in the UK can offer to sponsor and house people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine who have obtained a visa through a new government scheme. So far more than 3,000 visas have been issued to Ukrainians with “tens of thousands” more expected to be provided, according to the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove. The first refugees to use the new route are expected to arrive in the UK by the end of the week, when they will be matched with people offering spaces in their homes. How will it work? The “homes for Ukraine” programme allows individuals, charities, community groups and businesses across the UK to offer a room or home rent-free to Ukrainians escaping the war, regardless of whether they have ties to the country. Michael Gove described it as a “national effort” on behalf of those in desperate need. The scheme follows widespread criticism of the Home Office’s slow and bureaucratic approach to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. The UK government is due to launch a website gathering expressions of interest from potential hosts later on Monday. Gove has said he has said he is looking into taking in a Ukrainian refugee and the actor Benedict Cumberbatch said from the Baftas red carpet that he hoped to take part in the scheme. Asked whether he would take part, Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said on Monday he was “starting to have a conversation with my wife about that”, but committed only to helping with the refugee crisis in some way. An Opinium poll for the Observer suggested that almost one in three Britons might be willing to invite a Ukrainian refugee to live with them. Nine percent said they would definitely do so, while 20% said they might. A previous community sponsorship scheme, largely aimed at welcoming Syrians, has proved relatively slow and bureaucratic with only about 700 individuals receiving such support since 2015. Members of the public can nominate a Ukrainian individual or family to stay with them for at least six months. Sponsored Ukrainians will be granted three years’ leave to remain in the UK, and will be able to work, claim benefits and access public services during this period. This has yet to be disclosed, but Gove has said steps will be taken to ensure hosts and refugees are prevented from “abusing” the new scheme. He said security checks would establish whether people “are who they say they are” and to prevent the scheme “being exploited possibly by criminal elements”, noting that this “would only ever be a tiny minority”. The Home Office will also check that the people offering up their homes are in a position to provide that support. A spokesperson for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said the charity did not want to see unnecessary barriers in the process, but added that “it is vital child protection is built into every stage of the government’s and local authorities’ response to this crisis”. The NSPCC urged the government to work with the foster communities, charities and other partners “to ensure the sponsorship scheme is safe”. People offering accommodation to Ukrainian refugees will receive a payment of £350 a month, though this does not increase for additional people. Gove has also said local authority areas will be entitled to more than £10,000 per Ukrainian refugee using this route to the UK. Additional payments will be available to support school-age children who need to be accommodated within the education system, he said. The Refugee Council says the UK is not being as welcoming as EU countries, which have waived visa requirements for Ukrainians in the short term. Chief Executive Enver Solomon told the Guardian the UK scheme was “effectively a managed migration route, which is not suitable to use to respond to a humanitarian crisis”. Solomon also said the programme should only be one part of Britain’s response to the crisis, and urged the government to introduce a properly resourced programme that would enable Ukrainians to live independently in the UK, including access to healthcare and housing benefits. Solomon and the NSPCC have also urged the government to put in place expert mental health support for both hosts and guests, since many refugees will be suffering from trauma. “It’s a bit like asking people to become foster carers without having a social worker in place. There needs to be good quality specialist support otherwise it risks relationships breaking down,” Solomon said. There have been also concerns about the tight timeframe, with the NSPCC calling it an “ambitious turnaround”. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, have said that as well as taking part in the UK-wide scheme their nations are willing to become “super sponsors” for Ukrainian refugees to speed up the process and allow large numbers to come to the respective nations more quickly. Sturgeon has urged Westminster to waive all visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals trying to get into the UK, criticising the government’s approach so far as “beset with bureaucracy and red tape”. In Northern Ireland, the Executive Office has strongly encouraged expressions of interest, and these can be made through an online portal due to open on Monday.",News/World news,What do we know about UK scheme to take in Ukrainian refugees?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/ukraine-refugee-scheme-uk-homes
3/14/2022,"Vladimir Putin will be “held responsible” for war crimes in Ukraine at the international criminal court in The Hague, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has pledged, saying the UK would help gather the necessary evidence. The justice secretary, Dominic Raab, was travelling to The Hague on Monday to help make sure that “when that prosecution comes, the court will have what it needs”, Javid told BBC One’s Breakfast programme. Javid was asked for his response to the news that a pregnant woman shown in a much-used photograph being stretchered out of a bombed maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol had reportedly since died, as had her baby. “It fills me with rage to see something like that. These are appalling atrocities committed on innocent civilians in Ukraine by the Russians,” Javid said, saying the World Health Organization had documented 31 attacks so far on health facilities. “These are war crimes and Putin will be held responsible,” he added. Asked how, Javid said: “He will be ultimately held responsible for sure by the international court. Today, the justice secretary, my colleague, is going to The Hague and he’ll be meeting there with the chief prosecutor and others, offering UK support to gather evidence.” Asked about potential Nato support for Ukraine, Javid stressed that the alliance was a “defensive organisation”, but warned of consequences for Russia if Nato nations were targeted, after strikes close to the Polish border. “If a single Russia toecap steps into Nato territory it will be considered an act of war,” Javid said. Overnight, Javid’s department announced that 21 Ukrainian children who have cancer had arrived in England with immediate family members to have NHS treatment. “They will now be cared for here in the UK for as long as is needed,” Javid said. “To do this it was quite an operation over the weekend. A number of partners were involved, and I’m very grateful to them, especially the Polish government and the NHS. And I’m pleased that we can provide support in this way.” Asked if more such patients would come, Javid said the UK was “working with international partners”, and that another aspect was to support Poland and Moldova. The government is expected to announce details of a scheme later on Monday by which Britons can host Ukrainian refugees arriving in the UK in their homes for six months. Asked about concerns raised from some refugees about the ability to carry out enough checks in the time provided, Javid said: “This is an unprecedented situation, and I think that it’s important to listen to charities that have experience, and help work out how this can work. “But I don’t think the fact we haven’t done this before should be some kind of block on not trying to do this in this way at this point. I think it is very valuable for a Ukrainian refugee arriving in the UK to have a British host to help them in so many ways, not least to integrate into British life.” Asked if he would consider hosting a refugee, Javid said he was “starting to have a conversation with my wife about that”, but did not commit to doing so.",News/World news,"Putin will be held responsible for war crimes at ICC, says Sajid Javid",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/vladimir-putin-war-crimes-icc-sajid-javid-hague
3/14/2022,"It’s agonisingly close, but this year Paul Thomas Anderson gets the gold, with co-producers Sara Murphy and Adam Somner, for his delirious, delectable comedy Licorice Pizza. (Wait! Is it a comedy?) I think I would watch it every day, twice a day, if I thought I could get away with it. The sheer pleasure of this film is somehow not directly connected with performances, or narrative, or genre (the genre here is almost impossible to pin down) but with its pure texture, which is sensual and sublime. It’s a film which has, in Chuck Berry’s words: no particular place to go, but there’s joy in the journey, the sheer film-making bravura. Tellingly, one of the key scenes concerns a truck which has to be steered and guided downhill without gasoline: the movie has the same miraculous freewheeling touch.The performances are a miracle in themselves. Anderson has taken two complete movie-acting newcomers and found them to be complete naturals. Cooper Hoffman (son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) plays Gary Valentine, a fast-talking high-schooler and child actor in 1973 California with iffy skin who realises that his showbiz career is on the skids now that he’s getting bigger and so decides to sell waterbeds as a side-hustle. And he’s also fallen in love with a young woman who works as assistant to the school photographer — and this is the wonderful Alana Haim, of the pop band Haim, for whom Anderson has already directed videos. She is amused and exasperated and in spite of herself intrigued by Gary’s attention and also, from her position in the studio audience, impressed by what turns out to be Gary’s final professional child-actor appearance: his New York press tour for the imaginary family movie Under One Roof: Alana had been persuaded to be his travel chaperone — a truly dysfunctional beginning to their romance, or business partnership, or whatever it is. Their relationship bops and pinballs around, ricocheting off various minor characters: a washed-up movie star based on William Holden played by Sean Penn, temperamental producer Jon Peters played by Bradley Cooper and a troubled political candidate played by Benny Safdie. The musical stings from Bowie and McCartney are swoonworthy in themselves.It’s a very Pynchonian affair in its way (appropriate, as Anderson has adapted Inherent Vice) and the surreal comic scrapes satirically co-exist with nastiness and grotesquerie: swipes of anti-Jewish and anti-Japanese racism. Gary himself is based on Tom Hanks’s producing partner Gary Goetzman – who really was a child actor and waterbed sales guy in his teens – and also based on a kid Anderson saw 20 years ago hitting on a young woman. But in a way, Gary floats free of these specific influences, he is just a creation of this fervently remembered or imagined Californian era, like Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt’s actor and stuntman in Tarantino’s Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. Alana Haim herself is a triumph: a stylish, effortlessly charismatic figure (rather like Barbra Streisand in fact). This is movie hedonism, cine-sensuality. It is glorious.",Arts/Film,Why Licorice Pizza should win the best picture Oscar,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/14/why-licorice-pizza-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar
3/14/2022,"In the vocational struggle to hold the reader’s attention, the writer of historical fiction has an advantage. Whereas non-historical novelists must coax us into caring about nobodies, those who portray famous characters can assume our automatic interest: we relish the chance to see up close and intimately the great men and women of the past. For his fifth novel and first foray into historical fiction, Stephen May, whose prior work includes the novels Stronger Than Skin and Wake Up Happy Every Day along with a number of plays, has selected a particularly glamorous cast and setting. It’s London, May 1907, and a gathering of Marxist revolutionists including Stalin (known here as Koba, his self-chosen name after a heroic figure from Georgian folklore), Lenin, Rosa Luxemburg, Trotsky and Maxim Gorky have convened at the 5th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour party. It’s a decade before the revolution, and Stalin is a young buck of 29 with a dialectical-materialist dream in his heart and a twinkle in his eye. No sooner has he stepped off the boat in an England whose degradations are evoked with Hogarthian relish than we mark a flicker of the dark personality that will wreak unquantifiable terror on the future Soviet Union: perceiving a slight from one of his comrades, he logs the transgression while silently vowing revenge. In electing Koba/Stalin as his lead character, May sets up a dynamic whereby on every page we compulsively compare the figure before us, domineering and vengeful, yet not without sensitivity and even kindness – indeed a sometime poet – with the dread tyrant he is to become. In party matters, Koba employs the same streetfighter’s attitude that as a boy allowed him to rule the schoolyard: “Go in hard. Use the element of surprise. Give no quarter. Don’t allow yourself the luxury of mercy.” I wasn’t always sure if Sell Us the Rope adds up emotionally. Koba’s Rosebud-like attachment to an urchin named Arthur, who symbolises the abused child he once was, and his not infrequent displays of decency, seem oddly generous traits to imaginatively grant a man who would go on to coldly order the deaths of millions. Perhaps, though, this is a fallacy of retrospect on my part, and the psychopathic paranoia that motivated Stalin’s historic crimes was a degenerative condition, corroding his residual humanity year by year. Besides, the story is not only Koba’s. During the London conference, party members concern themselves with resolving the conflict between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, schmoozing the establishment British left for donations at a mansion cocktail party, and keeping tabs on the tsarist secret police force – the Okhrana – who even in London are scheming against the revolutionists. A 19-year-old Finn named Elli Vuokko tries to seduce Koba (his wife and child are back in Georgia) and becomes friends with the older, formidable Luxemburg, whose husband is incensed by an affair she is conducting with a younger man. In focusing on the conference’s summer-camp romantic intrigues and blooming friendships, Sell Us the Rope does what such novels are good at and reveals the texture of history as an all too human bricolage of private resentments, sexual slights, flawed personalities and mixed motives. At times, May too obviously projects contemporary attitudes into the past, as when Lenin strategises about winning over philanthropists by appealing to their desire to be on that fabled plane, “the right side of history”. I won’t spoil it, but halfway through the novel something happens that had me rapidly scanning my knowledge of 20th-century history for glaring blindspots. Referring to the author’s helpful afterword, I learned that the plot-quickening revelation in question – this intriguing novel’s most audacious ploy – is neither an outright fabulation nor a settled fact, but rather the fictive imagining of a controversial hypothesis whose opponents claim is based on a forgery. Which is only to say: all historical novels are speculative, but some are more speculative than others.Rob Doyle’s most recent book is Autobibliography  Sell Us the Rope by Stephen May is published by Sandstone Press (£8.99).

3/14/2022,"Aquick way to alcohol poisoning would be a drinking game where you take a shot every time there’s a long closeup in this film of Ben Affleck looking silently unshaven, disgusted and also turned on, yet not turned on enough to change that slack-jawed facial expression in any meaningful way. Legendary British director Adrian Lyne has returned to film-making after a 20-year gap with this laboriously paced and sometimes bafflingly edited erotic thriller, based on the 1957 novel by Patricia Highsmith. It was last filmed in 1981 as Eaux Profondes with Jean-Louis Trintignant and Isabelle Huppert, this time Affleck and Ana de Armas are the couple in a toxically and then murderously dysfunctional open marriage. Affleck plays Vic Van Allen, a super-wealthy tech guy who lives in a rather Updikean circle of well-to-do attractive couples; he retired young with little to do other than obsess about his gorgeous, free-spirited wife Melinda (De Armas) and her flagrant extramarital flirtations and flings; the understanding is that she is open about it with him, and Vic has persuaded himself that this excites him, but he is secretly becoming more and more enraged. A former acquaintance of Melinda’s called Malcolm McRae has disappeared, and to frighten and insult one of her new lovers at a party, drunken Vic tells him he has murdered McRae. It is a strange, ugly non-joke that plants a seed of violence in his festering mind, and his behaviour begins to disconcert all of their circle, particularly local writer Lionel Washington, played by Tracy Letts, who senses something very off with Vic – and perhaps sees how this could be a bestselling true-crime opportunity for him. Just occasionally, Lyne brings the right kind of flash, brash and trash to this fantastically silly and unbelievable story. But the film plods along in such a disconcerting way: there is no ratcheting up of tension, or plausible psychology, and the issue of McRae – as in, who killed him? What actually was he to Melinda? – is so bafflingly not addressed that you could suspect the whole thing is some Lynchian dream. Deep Water looks like a huge amount of material has been shaped in the edit but there are odd gaps and elisions. De Armas behaves as if she’s in some saucy cologne commercial, and Affleck appears to have necked a hundredweight of Percocet before the cameras rolled.

3/14/2022,"The Tate has severed relations with Viktor Vekselberg and Petr Aven after the Russian billionaires were sanctioned by the US and EU after the invasion of Ukraine. Vekselberg, the founder of a Russian energy conglomerate and an associate of Vladimir Putin, was an honorary member of the prestigious Tate Foundation, a fundraising charity for acquisitions, exhibitions, education and capital projects. “Mr Vekselberg donated to Tate seven years ago and no longer holds his honorary membership title,” the London gallery group said. Vekselberg has already been the target of US sanctions imposed in 2018. On Friday, he was again among a list of Russian billionaires facing US sanctions, with the government saying he has “maintained close ties” with Putin. His jet and yacht have been identified as “blocked property”. As well as the Tate, he has donated in the US to the Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall – prior to sanctions being imposed. Vekselberg’s fortune is estimated to be as much as $9.3bn (£6.9bn), which he began amassing after Russia’s oil and aluminium industries were privatised. “This relisting is not only unfounded but seems to rely on demonstratively baseless assumptions,” said Vekselberg in a statement. In a letter sent by Vekselberg to Tate on Thursday, seen by the Financial Times, he said he was ready to step down “if the foundation believes that this act is necessary”, adding that he had been “genuinely happy [his] donations have contributed to the development of cultural ties”. He added: “I will continue to do everything I can to accelerate the advent of peace.” The group, which operates Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London, has also ended its relationship with Aven, a member of its donor programmes. Earlier this month, Aven stepped down from LetterOne, the London-based investment company he co-founded with fellow businessman Mikhail Fridman, after the EU imposed sanctions on the pair earlier this month. Aven, who has an estimated $5.5bn fortune, owns Ingliston House, near Virginia Water, on 3.4 hectares (8.5 acres) of land in a gated estate next to Wentworth golf course. It boasts an art collection including works by Larionov, Goncharova and Kandinsky, as well as garden sculptures by Louise Bourgeois, Henry Moore and Antony Gormley. Aven and Fridman have rejected the accusations made in the EU sanctions as “spurious and unfounded”. Aven was a member of the Tate donor programmes known as the International Council and European Collection Circle. “Mr Aven’s support of Tate has now ended,” the gallery group said. Earlier this month, he stepped down as a trustee of the Royal Academy Trust and the London gallery returned his donation towards its current exhibition, Francis Bacon: Man and Beast. Aven declined to comment. Tate said it had no further relationships with, and donors, current or former, associated with the Russian government. “We are ready to act if any sanctions are extended to anyone in our network of supporters,” the Tate said. “And our trustees and directors are committed to doing all they can to support the people of Ukraine and to join the international condemnation of Russia’s invasion.” Among the Tate’s donors is Sir Leonard Blavatnik, a Ukrainian-born billionaire with US and UK citizenship, who was a college friend and former business partner of Vekselberg in Russia during the 1990s. After he made a £50m donation towards the new extension at Tate Modern, it was renamed the Blavatnik Building in 2017. Blavatnik does not appear on any sanctions lists and has never been a Russian citizen.",News/Business,Tate galleries cut ties with sanctioned billionaires after Ukraine invasion ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/14/tate-galleries-billionaires-ukraine-invasion-us-eu
3/14/2022,"Idiscovered recently that Richard Wagner liked to spend his evenings at home performing scenes from Henry VI. You can see why Shakespeare’s monumental trilogy would appeal to the creator of the Ring cycle. You could also hardly have a starker contrast than Wagner’s solo efforts – “in the face of which,” said his wife, Cosima, “mortals can only be silent” – and the RSC’s upcoming production of Henry VI Parts 2 and 3, which will feature a total cast of 120. This massive project is in the hands of Owen Horsley, who last year co-directed, with Gregory Doran, a streamed version of Henry VI: Part 1, which broke all the usual rules by allowing viewers access to rehearsals. Meeting Horsley during a lunch break on his epic venture, I was struck by the calm assurance of this Fife-born Scot. And, having spent eight years with Cheek by Jowl and as long working on the RSC history cycle, he clearly knows his Shakespeare. Of Henry VI, he says: “These plays, whenever they are done – especially at the RSC – invite experimentation. So I’m working with a company of 25 professional actors including eight recent drama school graduates. For Part 2, which we call Henry VI: Rebellion, they will be joined by 74 adults recruited from the length and breadth of England – though, sadly, not Scotland – and 21 young performers from the RSC’s Next Generation company. They will all come together for Jack Cade’s rebellion when there’s a stage direction that says ‘Enter Cade and all his rabblement’.” Although, as Horsley says, there is a sense of scale to these plays, these 95 recruits “aren’t simply there to make up the numbers”. Some will have speaking parts, such as the character of Saunder Simpcox, who lays fraudulent claim to a miracle cure. “One way to experience Shakespeare is to see it,” says Horlsey. “Even better is to be in it. We are offering people the opportunity to connect with Shakespeare and hopefully pass on the joy of that experience to others.” Horsley’s appetite for experiment doesn’t stop there. He has edited the text so that Act 5 of Part 2 now opens Part 3, forming a sequence of battles aptly titled Wars of the Roses. As if he didn’t have challenges enough, Horsley is also exploring the use of cameras and projected images on stage. “What Shakespeare is interested in,” he says, “is the humanity behind the history. There is a scene where Henry has to decide what to do when the Duchess of Gloucester, his aunt, is accused of treason. We will have a closeup of Mark Quartley as Henry to explore the dilemma he faces in making a judgment. During the battle scenes, we’ll also have cameras on stage taking us into the thick of the conflict. The actors themselves, in medieval costume, will be working the cameras.” When I say that this sounds “very Katie Mitchell”, Horsley laughs and accepts it as a great compliment. These plays naturally have their own history within the RSC. It was the Peter Hall and John Barton production of The Wars of the Roses, with Peggy Ashcroft and David Warner, that in 1963 shaped the company’s identity. In 2008, along with Richard III, they formed the climax of an eight-play History cycle directed by Michael Boyd. I wondered if Horsley felt intimidated by the weight of the past. “I’ve never seen these plays on stage,” he says, “and I did my edit of the text without checking what others have done. I’ve since gone back and been astonished at how much new material Barton wrote and I loved Michael Boyd’s use of ghosts to show the interaction of past and present. But, as a director, you have to trust your own instincts and remember that you are doing these plays for an audience in 2022. In this industry, comparison is such a waste of energy and time.” Critics, however, live by comparisons and some will inevitably be made with past RSC glories. But what strikes me is Horsley’s passion for, and acute perceptiveness about, these plays. He points out that the chasm of experience between the high and low-born is pinpointed by a line from the wife of the fraudster, Simpcox, who says “Alas, sir, we did it for pure need”. He also says that on the first day of rehearsals he banned the word “weak” in describing Henry VI, seeing him as a complex man whose indecision stems from a desire to balance competing arguments. And when I ask if it has been unnerving to rehearse these plays at a time of war in eastern Europe, he says that there have been discussions every morning about the day’s news. But he adds that although these plays are all about power, murder and ego, you don’t have to strain to make them seem topical. “I’ve always seen Shakespeare,” he says with a commonsense rare in the age of auteur directors “as allowing the resonances to arrive unaided at the audience’s ear”. Henry VI: Rebellion opens at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford, on 1 April and Wars of the Roses on 11 April.",Arts/Stage,"‘Experience Shakespeare by seeing it – even better, be in it’: inside the RSC’s new epic",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/14/experience-shakespeare-by-seeing-it-even-better-be-in-it-inside-the-rscs-new-epic
3/14/2022,"When Lisa McGee was a kid in Derry in the 90s, she swore she would never write about Northern Ireland, least of all about the Troubles. She wanted to write Murder She Wrote, or better still, to grow up and become its heroine, the author turned detective Jessica Fletcher. “I just thought her life was class. She lived in this beautiful place and she wrote novels really easily because she had all this time to solve murders as well.” Now McGee, 40, has got the fairytale for real that Jessica Fletcher had on screen, minus the murders. “Taxi drivers and Sainsbury’s delivery men will go: ‘Are you the Lisa McGee that writes Derry Girls?’ And I’ll have come to the door in my pyjamas. Occasionally in Murder She Wrote, someone would come over and go: ‘Are you the Jessica Fletcher? And now it’s like that for me.” In case you haven’t seen it, Derry Girls, set in the mid-90s, is technically a sitcom, but “dramedy” feels closer. Its five working-class teenage girls create a tight, effervescent ensemble, getting into scrapes. It will lose a bit in the translation when I say they set fire to things, steal things, get impossible crushes, fall foul of nuns – it sounds slapstick, because it is, but there’s a depth to the characters and a bossy, hard-bitten tenderness in the family dynamics that add layers to the comedy. It took months to cast them, since their chemistry is so important. Plus, McGee says: “I really wanted them to feel like girls from Derry, not people doing accents. There’s a punk attitude to teenage girls in Derry. They’ve got a very bold sense of humour. They’re fearless. You have to have that sort of swagger. It’s hard to pretend to have that.” Were her own teenage years just like the Derry girls’? “I know a lot of female writers who object to this question,” McGee says, sternly. We meet in Broadcasting House, the Beeb’s London HQ. “I feel like I’m in W1A,” she says, excited, as if she’s on a tour of the building for the first time, rather than an extremely accomplished writer who has been in and out for years. As for W1A, she watches a lot of telly and, when it’s good, will always say so. McGee with a mask on, as she is when she arrives, looks quite Hollywood, glossy chestnut hair and huge eyes; without a mask on, she has a very warm smile and, I must admit, I don’t find her stern voice very scary. What would other writers object to? “The fact that if you’re a woman and you write, it has to be a true story, basically. But I don’t mind talking about it because obviously some of it is very much my life.” Erin in particular, played by Saoirse-Monica Jackson, is pretty much McGee; her mum and dad are not at all dissimilar to the writer’s own, who left school at 14 and 15 respectively. “They met in Woolworths when my dad was a lorry driver and my mum worked in shops.” And, oh my God, the grandad: “My grandad was even called Joe [like the patriarch in Derry Girls]. He was a big, big character, a force of nature. A lot of my family feel like he’s not gone, because of Derry Girls. It’s really cute.” A measure of Derry Girls’ popularity is the evangelical zeal it inspires – people will still forcefully recommend it, four years after it premiered, without a thought to whether they sound slow off the mark. It’s partly down to Jackson, who has a rare, clownish quality that makes you laugh before she has said anything. “Saoirse is very physical,” McGee says thoughtfully. “I’m not someone that writes physical jokes normally, but she just looks so funny when she falls over.” True to her younger self, McGee never set out to write something about the Troubles, but unavoidably, given the period in which the show is set, that context hovers over the capers like a shadow. “I’ve only realised this lately,” she says. “If I was a different writer, Derry Girls could be quite a bleak show. I’ve always leaned towards funny.” Viewers who aren’t familiar with this recent history can hear the seriousness under the gags, “and not only in Britain. You read some really funny things about people in Mexico, going into Google [rabbit] holes about Northern Ireland.” And for those who lived through it, “they’ll start talking to you about Derry Girls and Northern Ireland, and it starts funny, and then they’ll be telling you other stuff that isn’t funny. Me and the cast have all found this. It’s a way in, and there’s still a lot about that period that isn’t spoken about. There’s a lot of trauma and a lot of ghosts.” Meanwhile, the teenage dialogue is, line for line, among the best, the closest, in the TV canon, and while McGee tries to wave this off with some arch self-deprecation – “I don’t think I’ll ever grow up. Fifteen is the point that I have sort of stuck at” – she has made these girls so comical by taking them seriously. “I really like teenagers, and they’re often not well written, particularly in drama. They’re either treated like mini-adults, and it’s weird and sexual, or they’re not treated with the respect they deserve.” We are actually here to talk about Skint, a BBC Four series of mainly heartbreaking monologues from “people striving under tough circumstances”. McGee wrote one of the eight 15-minute episodes, featuring Jackson as an unhinged waiter, but is the series’ creative director. Tonally, the range is very wide – some of the films are really funny, some absolutely harrowing – and it took her a while, she says, to adjust to the fact that there was no single vision, no one voice holding everything together. She is absolutely passionate about the importance of getting the lived experience of poverty on to the screen. “It gets forgotten in the mix of all these discussions, and that’s the thing that affects everybody. If you’re poor, you’re poor, no matter what. It takes race and religion and all that stuff out of it. Everyone that’s very poor is screwed, and people in that situation need to be heard.” Her own trajectory – growing up working class in a grindingly poor area, getting a degree at Queen’s University Belfast, then almost immediately finding paid work at the National Theatre, in London – she doesn’t think would be possible for a young writer now, in a creative world where the barrier to entry is the endless unpaid internship. “You do loads of talks, and panels, people saying: ‘What can we do to get these [underprivileged] voices in?’ And I just say: ‘Give them money. Find the people and just give them a cheque. You don’t need masterclasses. You don’t need 100 people in a competition.’ I think it’s simpler than people make out. There’s going to be a lot of not very great plays soon, if it’s just all the same people talking only to each other. It’s really depressing.” Owing to the colossus presence of Sally Rooney, I now think all Irish universities are exactly like Trinity Dublin. In her novel Normal People, she sort of does a Brideshead on the uni, making it seem impossibly glamorous, full of beautiful people awash with money and boho sensibility. But Queen’s wasn’t like that at all. “Northern Irish people can never take themselves that seriously. We wouldn’t get away with it. That can be a problem when you’re at university, where you’re supposed to be engaging with ideas that are a bit wanky.” She says she still feels guilty that she didn’t do any work: “It was such an opportunity compared to what my parents were faced with. And I just had a lot of craic.” In fact, the craic was quite a useful apprenticeship, since she says she’s still using jokes now that she heard in pubs in the late 90s. Meanwhile, her mum did get a degree, as a mature student, and trained as a social worker, “around the same time as I was doing my GCSEs”, she says. “I remember being quite pissed off that she was stealing my thunder.” In fact, the craic was quite a useful apprenticeship, since she says she’s still using jokes now that she heard in pubs in the late 90s. She got the attachment at the National by sending them a play. “The great thing about writing is you have a physical thing – you can do it or you can’t. I didn’t have to go and do the interviews.” It’s much harder to get into directing and producing TV if you’re not really well connected. “When I meet a director who is working class, who has an accent, basically, I think they must be brilliant.” The National gave her a little space to work in, access to all the shows, a salary – it sounds like a dream, and, she says, “thank God I had no idea. I just walked into the writers’ room like an eejit. If I’d known it was a big deal, I probably would have ruined it by thinking I shouldn’t be there.” That was 2006, when she was pretty fresh out of university, putting on plays that never made any money. When she got the call from the National, she had the borrow the flight money from her mum. By her mid-20s, she had been commissioned to write her own show for the Irish national broadcaster, RTÉ. Raw was a playful, anarchic drama set in a restaurant in Dublin. It was such a success that it was moved to a primetime slot, but that took the fun out of it a bit for McGee. “It was a very young show, and very rude. As soon as it got big figures, it became more mainstream. I was 27 and I wanted to do cheekier work.” Amid all this, she had moved to rural Donegal, thinking that was the kind of thing a writer would do. “Then I realised: ‘There’s nobody about and I can’t drive.’ I was in the middle of Donegal for no good reason.” So she moved back to London and the commissions kept coming. She was one of the writers for three seasons of Being Human, Toby Whithouse’s genre-fusing series about flatmates who are, some of them, also vampires (others are werewolves). “I really connected to that. The ordinariness, the everlasting life, the drinking blood, it has a lot in common, vampire life, with the Catholic church.” She then had another show commissioned, London Irish, about Belfast expats, but it only did one series. “Not that I wasn’t grateful but it was really disappointing.” Overall, though, it was a more or less unbroken streak of green lights, which had its pros and cons. “I don’t regret any of it because it’s where I learned my craft. But I always had to work – there was this fear of stopping, I had no safety net. I actually wrote Derry Girls when I was pregnant, because I stopped for the first time. I really don’t know if my way was better, or if you should have this pure vision and only do your own stuff. I don’t know what plays I would have written if TV hadn’t been paying me real TV money. But my husband says: ‘You could write a play now’ and, yeah, I suppose I could.” She has two sons, six and two, and the family (she is married to the actor and screenwriter Tobias Beer) moved to Belfast after lockdown. “London became somewhere that didn’t make sense with young kids when you can’t go anywhere.” The Northern Irish capital is going through its own creative boom; every cafe you walk into, apparently, has someone talking into their AirPods about a film they’re making. She manages to convey that this is very handy, while at the same time not the Belfast she knew and loved. The Deceived, for Channel 5, came out in 2020 and McGee co-wrote it with Beer. “The first thing for me was that he had to be good,” she says. “Because what would you do?” She breaks off to imagine that perfect horror, of having to tell your husband that he can’t write. Anyway, he could, so that was fine, and “the writing totally saved our sanity. We are so boring. We only talk about TV shows anyway. So we might as well be writing one, and arguing about what things should be where, rather than anything else.” They’re working together on a new project, though Beer is doing most of it while McGee is taken up with Derry Girls, for its third and final season. “I think once it goes out, people will know that’s the right place to end. Hopefully. It’s always been a three-season plan.” Skint, meanwhile, with its tight, gritty, sparse dramas, is a departure for McGee, given her sensibility. “You wake up every day and everyone’s depressed and lonely. People need joy, they need to laugh, I definitely don’t want to be spending all my time doing something depressing.” But looked at from another angle, it’s weirdly on-brand. “This sounds mad, considering what they are, but I think of them like a joke. You have your setup, and then you have a trick in the middle – this is what it’s going to be about, a red herring – and then you have a reveal.” She’s not always prospecting for the lolz, but she brings a fascinated seriousness to the magic and mechanics of humour. Skint airs on BBC Four from 20 March. Series three of Derry Girls is coming soon to Channel 4 and All 4.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘I’ll never grow up!’ Derry Girls’ Lisa McGee on comedy, class and her new show Skint ",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/14/ill-never-grow-up-derry-girls-lisa-mcgee-on-comedy-class-and-her-new-show-skint
