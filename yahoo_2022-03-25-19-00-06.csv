3/25/2022,"Former Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) appeared on Hannity Thursday where she and Sean Hannity got into it over whether or not the U.S. and NATO allies should continue to give military aid to Ukraine in its fight against the unprovoked Russian invasion. When Hannity asked if it would be wise for the world to stop the “megalomaniac murdering thug” Vladimir Putin, Gabbard answered, “We have to look at the world as it exists in reality, not the world that we wish existed.” “You’re ducking,” Hannity said. “Tulsi, I’m asking a real question here.” Despite Ukraine pushing back the Russian offensive in parts of the country, and the Russian military suffering heavy losses, Gabbard, who has repeatedly pushed Russian propaganda, argued that the real cruelty is giving Ukrainians hope by supporting them militarily. It is not strategically possible to think that Ukraine is going to beat Russia.
Tulsi Gabbard “Give them nothing because Russia has nukes and they might use them,” Hannity said. “That’s your answer?” “We’ve provided a tremendous amount of support to Ukraine,” Gabbard said, “not only now, but over the years so that they have the ability to defend themselves. And the Ukrainian military…” “But should we give them the weapons so they can — you’re not answering,” Hannity cut in. “Should we give them the weapons to win the war? They’re doing a great job. Everyone acknowledges that. Should we give them — and Europe — give them the weapons if they’re willing to fight for their country?” “They can’t win this war, Sean,” Gabbard answered. “This is the real world that we live in. It is not strategically possible to think that Ukraine is going to beat Russia.” Hannity once again pressed Gabbard for a straight answer to his question, but didn’t get it. “When you see images of dead women and children, and when you see neighborhoods blown out… you do not think we should provide them the weapons to defend themselves. I just want to know, yes or no?” As the two continued to argue and talk over each other, Gabbard’s response was a roundabout way of saying that the U.S. and NATO should stop supporting Ukraine and hand victory to Russia so the war will come to an end. Hannity airs weeknights at 9 p.m. on Fox News Channel. Watch Putin's spokesman tell CNN that there are 'reasons for nuclear arms to be used': CNN’s Christiane Amanpour interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, Tuesday where she pressed him on the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons. Russian officials have threatened nuclear war if the West was to interfere with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“I need to ask you this, because the world is afraid, and I want to know if Putin intends the world to be afraid of the nuclear option,” Amanpour said. “Would he use it?” “President Putin intends to make the world listen to and understand our concerns,” Peskov said. “We have been trying to convey our concerns to the world, to Europe, to the United States, for a couple of decades. But no one would listen to us.”
When pushed, Peskov invoked Russia’s National Security Concept, which was amended in 2000 to allow for wider use of nuclear weapons, but claimed that Russia would only use them if there’s an existential threat.
“Well, we have a concept of domestic security and, well, it’s public. You can read all the reasons for nuclear arms to be used,” Peskov said. “So if it is an [existential] threat for our country, then it can be used in accordance with our concept. There are no other reasons mentioned in that text.” Read more from Yahoo Entertainment: 'Survivor' challenge had to be stopped due to contestants being overwhelmed by waves Lisa Kudrow 'enthusiastic' about potential 'Romy and Michele's High School Reunion' sequel 'Masked Singer' judges shocked by double-eliminees' secret singing skills: 'Who knew?'

3/25/2022,"Lee Yong-soo, a woman who was subjected to sexual slavery during World War II under the Imperial Japanese Army, is demanding that the United Nations (UN) seek justice by asking Japan to formally apologize and take full responsibility.

After being inspired by Korean human rights activist Kim Hak-sun, Lee told her story to the world in 1992. She described having been dragged away from home at 16 and forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army. Lee faced harrowing torture and abuse at a Japanese military brothel in Taiwan until the end of the war.

With the number of survivors declining, Lee believes that her recent plea to the UN may be her last hope in getting closure. Of the 239 women that registered with the Seoul government as victims, only 12 remain alive today.

Lee believes that the historical dispute between South Korea and Japan cannot be settled without the involvement of the UN and has been campaigning for the issue to be taken to the UN’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) since last year.

The 93-year-old leads an international group of sexual slavery survivors and advocates and who sent a petition to the UN last week demanding that the organization take the issue to the ICJ.

The group asked South Korea to call for an arbitration of whether Tokyo has failed to comply with the 1984 Convention Against Torture by downplaying or failing to acknowledge their past war crimes, should Japan fail to jointly bring the case to the ICJ.

In 2015, the ministers of both South Korea and Japan reached an agreement that Japan would send 1 billion yen (approximately $8 million) to a South Korean fund that helps to support the survivors. Lee and the other survivors stated that the Seoul officials had not consulted with them in regards to the agreement, following controversial comments made by Japanese government leaders, leading them to question the sincerity of the gesture.

Japan’s Foreign Affairs Ministry has described recent lawsuits filed by the victims as being “extremely regrettable and absolutely unacceptable,” while urging Seoul to comply with the agreement that was settled in 2015. They also stated that their government had not found documents proving that sexual slavery had occured through force by Japan’s Imperial Army.

Lee expressed to the Associated Press office in Seoul that she would not stop fighting “until the very end” to receive justice.

“Both South Korea and Japan keep waiting for us to die, but I will fight until the very end,” Lee said. “I think time has so far waited for me so that I can clench my teeth and do everything that I can to resolve this issue.” Enjoy this content?
