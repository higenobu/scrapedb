1/10/2022,"Trainual is a software company that takes an unusual approach to staff retention. The CEO told Insider that paying new starters to leave helps maintain a strong company culture. ""It's a powerful thing for them to turn down the cash, opt in, and commit,"" he said. Many business owners in a wide range of industries have struggled to find and retain staff amid a nationwide labor shortage. In November, a record 4.5 million Americans quit their jobs. In many cases, people have cited poor working conditions and low pay as factors. In an attempt to secure workers, businesses have been hiking wages, offering hiring bonuses, and providing education benefits to attract more staff. But even amid these changes, the labor crunch is still persisting into the new year and a study conducted in November 2021 suggested the problem may continue beyond 2022, despite employers' efforts. One company, however, has found a novel approach to finding and retaining workers. Chris Ronzio, CEO of Trainual, an Arizona-based software company that helps small businesses onboard, train, and scale teams, told Insider he pays employees to quit. He said the strategy helps him keep top talent across the industry as well as maintain strong company culture. ""With today's market, hiring teams have to move quickly to assess candidates and get them through the process to a competitive offer, so it's impossible to be right 100% of the time,"" Ronzio said. He added: ""The offer to quit allows the dust to settle from a speedy process and let the new team member throw a red flag if they're feeling anything but excited."" Ronzio instituted the pay-to-quit policy in May 2020. At the time, the company was offering employees $2,500 to quit after two weeks if they had any sense of doubt. None of the 38 people they hired since the policy was implemented has taken the offer. The company has recently raised the amount to $5,000. ""We looked at our average salary when we considered changing the amount and ultimately figured that if somebody is making $80,000 or $100,000 a year, then $2,500 might not be significant enough,"" Ronzio said. ""They could decide to stay while they look for another job because they'll make more staying. So we adjusted the number with that in mind."" As an employer, Ronzio said he's responsible for building an inclusive culture. He believes that giving employees a financial incentive and the power to ""fire the company"" sends a compelling message in culture building. ""It's a powerful thing for them to turn down the cash, opt in, and commit — and it sets the stage for a great working relationship,"" he said. It also holds the hiring team accountable because there is a cost to the business if they get it wrong, Ronzio said. The logic behind the two-week window is that there is less disruption to the business than there would be after a longer period of time, when the company has invested more in the employee. But what about the employees who decide to stay? Ronzio said that employees don't receive any specific incentive for continuing at the company. ""Those who refuse the $5,000 miss out on something 'extra' at this point in the timeline, because they believe the long-term value of sticking with us is worth much, much more.""

1/10/2022,"Donald Trump and Republicans are shoving America toward authoritarianism. That’s why many of us are shouting about a threat to democracy. Many Americans don’t fear a potential slide into authoritarianism because they have no basis for doing so. Our oceans and hegemony have coddled us; we take democracy for granted. But democracy and the rule of law are not the normal state of governments, certainly not historically. Authoritarianism wouldn’t happen overnight, but authoritarian regimes have shown us a road map. Here’s a picture of what it would look like here. If Trump and his enablers get their way, how you experience your life would depend on whether you identified — and were identified — as a Trump Republican. Identified as a Trump Republican by your bumper sticker, you would be more likely to get a warning instead of speeding ticket. You would gain the inside track for government jobs, grants, and needed permits. Decisions about government benefits, like unemployment and disability, would be more likely to go your way. Your children would be more likely to win scholarships and admission to their chosen schools. You would get more favorable loan and mortgage treatment and better access to scarce goods, the best tickets.

You could rely on the criminal justice and judicial systems to go easy on you, if not help you out. If, instead, you were perceived as a Democrat, or just an insufficiently Trump Republican, you would experience the reverse of what’s above. Tax auditors would focus on you. You would be more likely to be hassled by police, even jailed if you were too troublesome. Nasty graffiti might appear on your business or home. You would be accused of being un-American, a traitor. You would learn to keep your head down and be careful about what you said to whom. Science would be interpreted or even suppressed to suit Trump Republican needs. History would be whitewashed to celebrate the regime and its version of events. School curricula and texts would similarly conform. LBGTQ folks would closet themselves again. Fewer women would lead in government, business, or society. People who want to marginalize and discriminate against people of color, non-Christians, and immigrants would find cover to do so. Abortion and birth control would be illegal. Public education would wither as religious schools claimed more and more public funding. Air and water quality would suffer. Climate change would go unaddressed. The military could be used to put down dissent. Again, not all of this would happen instantly, and we can’t predict how far the Trump Republicans would go. But this is the path that they are on. So if you are a Trump Republican, perhaps all this sounds great. Finally, justice for my many grievances. Maybe that’s the country in which you want to live. I hope and pray that the great majority of Americans will reject it. Jim Chrisinger is a retired public servant living in Ankeny.
