1/21/2022,"Magnus Carlsen announced recently that his main chess target this year will be a fresh attempt to reach an all-time record rating of 2900, a level which narrowly eluded the world champion in 2014 and 2019. The 31-year-old Norwegian achieved 2882 in both years on the official Fide monthly rating lists, and peaked at 2889 on the unofficial 2700chess daily ratings. Carlsen also stated that he will only defend his world championship crown in 2023 if his opponent is Alireza Firouzja, 18, the world No 2 former Iranian who now represents France, or another from the teenage generation.  Expectations were high that after such a forecast Carlsen would aim for a fast start at Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee, the “chess Wimbledon” which he has won a record seven times. In the event, the early Wijk rounds have been a tale of missed opportunities for the Norwegian, 31, and in one case for his opponent. On Thursday evening after five of the 13 rounds, Carlsen was joint fourth on 3/5 with just a single win and four draws, while the world champion’s rating had dropped more than four points. With eight rounds to go, a grandstand finish is still possible, but even 6/8 for a total of 9/15 would only gain one rating point. In short, the ascent of 2900 is going badly. Carlsen began by drawing with Andrey Esipenko, the 19-year-old Russian who defeated him at Wijk 2021, after missing a chance for a strong central pawn push. Round two was a fine victory against the world No 7, Anish Giri. A draw against Poland’s World Cup winner Jan-Krzysztof Duda was followed by a wild game against Jorden van Foreest, the Dutchman who won Wijk 2021 and then joined Carlsen’s team for the world title match in Dubai. Carlsen missed an improbable win in the complications where the hidden winning manoeuvre was Kf1-e2-d1. Thursday’s fifth round against the tournament tailender Nils Grandelius could have been a real disaster, Carlsen offered a pawn in a sharp position by 19...d5? but it would have been two pawns for little compensation had the Swede found 20 Bxb5+ Kf8 and now 21 Qb4+! Kg8 22 Qb3! when the d5 pawn is pinned and lost. When Carlsen made his surges to a 2882 rating in 2014 and 2019, there were fewer rapid and blitz events, and little serious online play, to distract him. Now all this has changed, and Carlsen will defend his $1.6m Meltwater Champions Tour crown in a series of nine tournaments starting on 19 February. The Tour format has been revamped, with speeded up matches of one day rather than two and the introduction of three points for a win, one point for a draw. The leading trio at Wijk before Friday’s sixth round (1pm start) are India’s No 2, Vidit Gujrathi, Richard Rapport of Hungary, and the world No 5 from Azerbaijan, Shak Mamedyarov, all on 3.5/5. Mamedyarov caused a stir when he opened against Esipenko with 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 g4?! The Russian teenager declined the pawn after a long think, and the game was eventually drawn. Judging by the expert online comments, if that pawn is offered in a future game, it will be snapped up without hesitation. Mamedyarov was also involved in an unusual finish against Duda where White (to move) is rook for knight ahead but Black’s h2 pawn is menacing and he threatens Rf5-h5. However, after White’s next move, Duda resigned. What happened? The answer is alongside the puzzle solution. 3799: 1...Bxe4! 2 Rxe4 Ra8! wins as Black threatens Qxe4, Nxe4 and Ra1+. The game ended 3 h4 Qxe4 4 Qxe4 Nxe4 5 Be3 Ra2 6 g5 Rxb2 and White resigned two pawns down. If 3 Bxf6 Ra1+ 4 Ne1 Rxe1+! and Qxf3. Mamedyarov v Duda: 1 Kb3! Resigns.

1/21/2022,"A row over meat consumption in Spain over the last month is just the most recent eruption of the debate all over Europe, as the continent grapples with making its famous cuisines more sustainable. Food is inextricably intertwined with national identity for countries in continental Europe; a good steak, with perfect frites stacked beside it; a plate of wafer thin carpaccio, drizzled with dressing or plain old olive oil; wurst, served with good mustard; jamón ibérico laced with creamy white fat.  Europeans love their meat, and they eat a lot of it. About 1.5kg a week is consumed by the average citizen of the EU27 – that’s twice the global average. But it is also clear that if there is to be any hope of reducing the impact of global heating, that consumption level will have to fall rapidly. Greenpeace estimates that it will need to drop by 70% by the end of the decade, and down to 300g by 2050. That translates (since not all the meat that leaves slaughterhouses ends up being either sold or eaten) to each European actually eating, per week, a quantity of meat equivalent to about two good-sized hamburgers. The response to this news? Unenthusiastic, to say the least. Politically, balancing the priorities of environmental action against the clout of often powerful farming lobbies and the expectations of populations accustomed to consuming large quantities of unrealistically cheap meat looks nearly impossible. In Spain, for example, which holds the dubious honour of being the EU member state with the highest per capita meat supply in the bloc (more than 100kg per person, per year) the consumer affairs minister, Alberto Garzón, was engulfed in a national row last July after calling on his compatriots to eat less meat for the sake of the environment and of their own bodies. “Our health and the health of our families is at stake,” he said. “Eating too much meat is bad for our health, and for the planet.” Within hours, he had been slapped down not just by the agriculture minister, but by the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Asked what he made of Garzón’s plea, Sánchez observed: “Speaking personally, a medium-rare steak is hard to beat.” There is evidence that many Europeans are taking the issue seriously. One recent survey showed almost half (46%) of European consumers are now eating less meat than they once did, while 40% are planning on reducing their meat consumption in the future. The EU-backed study, of more than 7,500 people in 10 European countries, found a third actively sought to minimise their meat consumption – with 73% of that group saying they had “substantially” reduced their meat intake over the past months. But in its latest document, the European Commission suggests that despite clear and growing public awareness of the importance of sustainability, EU meat consumption per capita, left to its own devices, is likely to fall by little more than 3kg a year. Government intervention, then, will be essential, but, judging by Spain’s example, difficult. Garzón again told the Guardian in December that people had to reduce their meat consumption, and contrasted meat from traditional, extensive farming with that produced on intensive megafarms, but parts of Garzón’s interview were seized on by the conservative People’s party and the far-right Vox party, who have demanded he resign for what they portray as an unforgivable attack on Spain’s important meat industry and the quality of its exports. The consumer affairs minister has stuck by his words, accusing “the lobby of certain big companies which promote polluting megafarms” of deliberately distorting what he said. His comments, moreover, do not differ wildly from official government policy. The ministry for ecological transition wants extensive production systems promoted, and well-adapted native breeds used more. The agriculture minister has praised small family farms, and some regional governments have already acted to limit intensive farming. In Germany, traditionally among the EU’s biggest consumers of animal-based products per capita, meat-eating has declined steadily over the last two decades, but here too the politics are sensitive. The Green party, part of the new three-party coalition with the centre-left SPD and the liberal FDP, might have been expected to throw itself into accelerating the falling trend, but has so far held back. The hesitancy comes from painful political experience. Germany’s Greens have suffered in recent years from being seen as a Verbotspartei, intent on banning the joys of life. A 2013 “veggie day” initiative for meat-free days at state-subsidised canteens saw the tabloid Bild complain that “the Greens want to take our meat away”. Instead, the environmental party has used its first weeks in power to initiate a less politically exposing campaign against junk meat sold for junk prices. The new agriculture minister, Cem Özdemir, told Bild Germans were losing out because food quality and food prices were too low. Junk prices, often imposed by all-powerful supermarket chains, he said, “drive farms to ruin, prevent animal welfare, promote species extinction and burden the climate. I want to change that.” The price of food should, he said, echoing the findings of a commission set up by the previous government, reflect the “ecological truth” and consumers must get used to paying a fair price for better quality. But this approach, too, is far from universally popular: the new government’s attack on cheap meat was criticised by the Paritätische Gesamtverband, an umbrella group for Germany’s social welfare organisations, which argues higher food prices must be accompanied by compensation payments for those on low incomes. And in Italy, the environment minister, Roberto Cingolani, triggered a fiery debate last year by saying excessive meat consumption was harmful to health and the environment, adding that encouraging Italians to eat less meat would be central to his plans. “Changing our diet will have the combined benefit of improving public health, decreasing water use and producing less CO2,” Cingolani said. Farmers hit back instantly, saying annual meat consumption per capita in Italy is among the lowest in Europe and meat was an important part of a balanced diet. Activists including Luca Mercalli, a well-known metorologist, are keeping the debate alive, arguing that better quality meat produced closer to home and consumed in smaller quantities would make a significant difference to the environment. “A proportion of Italians are sensitive to the topic and have changed their diets, either due to concerns about the climate or dietary motives,” Mercalli said. “The problem in Italy is the debate often turns toxic, with vegetarians becoming very judgmental of meat-eaters, which in turn alienates 90% of the population.” The onus should be on the government to provide clearer information, he said. “The message should be: eat less meat, but when you do, buy locally produced meat that is more sustainable. Even if you pay more, eating better quality meat once a week is far better than eating a cheap hamburger every day.” French meat consumption has also been falling steadily, with surveys suggesting half the population has reduced their meat consumption over the past three years and that 30% would like to continue doing so over the next three. And yet howls of outrage greeted the launch of France’s national low-carbon strategy, adopted in 2020, which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture – which represent 20% of the country’s total, with fully 80% generated by livestock farming – by 19% by 2030 and 46% by 2050. EU countries that have tried to implement concrete meat reduction policies have faced instant backlashes. The Danish government was forced in 2020 to reverse a ban on state canteens serving meat for two days every week after trade unions and the food industry objected, and the government has now instead switched its focus to boosting non-meat food production, approving a climate agreement that features the EU’s largest investment in plant-based research and development, including an annual fund to support the transition to a nationwide dietary shift. In the Netherlands, in an attempt to prioritise tackling the major environmental issues long caused by its intensive pig and other farms, the new government features a minister for nature and nitrogen affairs, Christianne van der Wal-Zeggelink. And all of this is no less true for the European Commission itself, struggling with the incompatibility of ambitious carbon emission reduction plans and the vast common agricultural policy subsidies that account for nearly a third of the EU’s budget. Greenpeace has broken down the numbers and calculates that a fifth of the EU’s entire budget is spent on livestock. As recently as 2020, the EU was still spending money to promote meat eating with a controversial and frankly slightly mad ad campaign exhorting people to become Beefatarians. “If the sound of beef sizzling on the grill brings tears to your eyes, you’re a real Beefatarian,” coos the ad. Confused? It’s only going to get worse.",News/Environment,‘The Greens want to take our meat away’: Europeans go to war over their dinner,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/21/the-greens-want-to-take-our-meat-away-europeans-go-to-war-over-their-dinner
1/21/2022,"What a miracle that the House of Lords rose up and rebelled this week against the government’s assault on protest. Labour had no idea how many peers on the crossbenches, let alone the Tory benches, or even among their own rapidly ageing and frail cohort would be there to vote against draconian new laws that are more redolent of Hong Kong than Britain. If the Lords is the last backstop against the arbitrary powers of an elective dictatorship, it relies on the thin safety net of enough members’ individual sense of justice in that 800-strong chamber – motivating them to turn up and stay late to vote. And this time, they did. This week the women’s rights activists Reclaim These Streets are in the high court arguing that the Metropolitan police breached human rights by banning a vigil on Clapham Common for Sarah Everard, who was murdered by a Met police officer. The group also allege that Met police officers used force while threatening protesters with £10,000 fines for breaching lockdown rules.  The spectacle of police charging into the spontaneous outpouring of anger and grief that night should have been shocking enough to stay the government’s hand in its attempt to ban virtually all effective protest. But no. In a parliamentary coup, after the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill went through the Commons, the government bypassed MPs by adding 18 pages of new anti-protest laws for the Lords. It was this outrageous procedure, as much as the laws themselves, that caused the Lords rebellion. In a clear attempt by the government to stifle protest groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain, the new clauses would have made it an offence to disrupt infrastructure, including (rightwing) newspaper printers, with tougher sentences for blocking a highway. Police would also have been given the right to stop and search anyone at a protest without cause for suspicion, looking for people who may be planning to “lock on” to objects – a vital part of protest. Perhaps most shockingly, courts could ban anyone “with a history of causing serious disruption” from attending specific protests at all, even if they have committed no offence. Ignoring the result of the vote, the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, says he is bringing controversial measures to restrict noise at protests – which were defeated in the Lords – back to the Commons in a new bill. He told the BBC’s Today programme that noisy protest “cannot be allowed to interfere with the lives of the law-abiding majority”. These freedom-loving libertarian Tories do a lot of venting about escape from the state’s illiberal powers to make them wear masks or seatbelts, or stop them from smoking indoors, or whatever other imaginary curtailments of their personal “freedom” irritate the readers of the Telegraph, Daily Mail and Spectator – reckless of public welfare. Yet they make not a bleat about the silencing of protest that is a cornerstone of liberty. What’s the point of protest? Anyone who has ever marched, sat down or locked on has asked themselves that. Few indeed are the marches that change a law, though specific and local ones can: fracking at Balcombe was stopped by Tory voters in the heart of Tory land. A million marching against the Iraq war didn’t prevent it. But as with the Chartists, mass protest does change how history looks back on events. Would Iraq be seen as such an unequivocal and illegal disaster without the spectacle of a government ignoring that biggest-ever demonstration of opposition? A giant Countryside Alliance protest seemed to frighten New Labour more. I went on the first nuclear disarmament march as a child with my father (that time, he stopped at the Bunch of Grapes in Knightsbridge and we went no further). I carried on protesting in my teenage years – marching four days every Easter with friends to the atomic weapons research station at Aldermaston. That marked my teenage calendar much like rock festivals are teen rites of passage now. Yet despite the Greenham Common years, the bomb stays unbanned, with this government planning to increase its nuclear arsenal. Suffragettes won, says history – though the more moderate suffragists claimed suffragette violence against property delayed that success. So, what protest does work? There is surprisingly little research, says David Mead, professor of human rights law at the University of East Anglia: “There’s no easy way to measure a causative link”. Steven Fielding, professor of political history at Nottingham University, says the myth of the Jarrow hunger marchers is overdone: they changed nothing. “The poll tax riots didn’t finish Margaret Thatcher, middle England complaints in Tory seats did.” Nothing works without capturing public attention – the press – and that takes wit, imagination, blocking streets, criminal damage or riots. The satirical collective Led By Donkeys is brilliantly subversive and effective, both online – as in its current Line of Duty spoof – and with its billboards and messages projected on to buildings. In the post-2010 austerity years I took part in UK Uncut protests that cleverly juxtaposed public cuts with private companies the group claimed avoided paying fair taxes: I joined an occupation of a Barclays branch to set up a “library”, a Boots to set up a “medical centre”, a Pret a Manger and a Top Shop protest, setting up a token “swimming pool” (a paddling pool) and a “nursery” inside tax avoiders’ premises, as emblems of all the losses they caused. Alas, UK Uncut vanished. Such groups rise and fall, new ones refreshing ways to make a mark. Does it do any good? Action solidifies opposition, encourages solidarity instead of despair among isolated objectors watching the climate reach boiling point. Pro-EU marches reminded us how close that vote was, how many were not consumed by Brexit lies, sending an affectionate message to Europe. Joining a march can feel futile, yet doing nothing feels worse. Protests can be annoyingly captured by the tiny Socialist Workers’ party’s bulk manufacture of placards, “usual suspect” imagery damaging the impact. But here we are with effective protest destined to be banned, allowing only staid, quiet, police-backed marches, whose dullness guarantees no press coverage. This is the real cancel culture, where toppling a statue could earn a 10-year sentence. It took the rebellion of a jury against bad laws to save the Colston Four. Maybe the many rowdy protests around the country against the bill encouraged this week’s Lords rebellion. But that’s just a stay of execution, as the government presses on. As with all present policies, expect no new leader selected by this generation of Tories to turn liberal. They have their own perverse interpretation of liberty.

1/21/2022,"My brother is really tight with spending on birthdays, and refuses to make an effort  Ollie, my younger brother, is a nightmare every time a birthday in our family rolls around, but he’s especially bad with mine. I am thinking of banning presents between us as it has caused a few arguments. He doesn’t put in the same amount of effort as I do for him. For years he wouldn’t even get me a card, whereas I go all out. I know it’s partly because I’m five years older than him, so when we were kids I wouldn’t expect much. But now that he’s 24, it offends me. Over the years I have given him designer shirts, clothing vouchers and electronics he’s asked for. He has bought me a cheap supermarket card with the sticker still on, a scented candle that smelled of nothing and a horrible scratchy scarf. A few years ago I snapped, and told him his gifts weren’t up to scratch. Ollie apologised, but then last year I got a text on the day and a cheap bouquet of flowers a month late. That year I had bought him some AirPods. For his 21st birthday, I bought him an expensive engraved gold necklace. He was really grateful, but that year I didn’t even get a birthday card – he completely forgot. I texted him the day after saying, sarcastically, “Thanks for your birthday message”, and he said he was sorry – he’d been stressed with his new job, but I don’t think that’s a valid excuse. Our youngest brother is really close with Ollie and they swap decent gifts all the time. Maybe it’s because they are boys, or because Ollie just knows what to get him. As the older sister it feels like the responsibility is always with me to keep up with birthdays, and his lack of effort makes me sad. Birthdays are a time to show a loved one that you care. He has known me for more than 20 years – so he should know what to get me. It’s especially important as we grow up. He needs to start being more thoughtful with gifts or it’s going to continue to affect our relationship. I feel as if I should start spending less and be less thoughtful, which is horrible, but what other solution is there? I admit I could do better at giving birthday gifts, but Elsie never tells me what she wants I am terrible with presents, but it’s usually because I forget Elsie’s birthday, or I’m preoccupied. This year I have put the date in my calendar, but I should have done that before. Girls are really hard to buy for and Elsie never tells me what she wants. I don’t have a girlfriend, so how am I supposed to know what to do? In the past, when I’ve tried to keep things simple with presents, Elsie has been offended. The time I got her a scented candle she was thankful to my face, and then months later I heard from our younger brother that she had actually been annoyed about it. She won’t tell me until long after the birthday has passed. I would love her to make a few gift suggestions so I have a rough idea of what to get her. Over the years she has let rip at me when I’ve forgotten her birthday. She’s like: “I don’t know why I bother.” That’s her favourite line. I sent her flowers in the post last year but they were late: it was lockdown, everyone was stressed. She wasn’t impressed but at least I did something. I think she also holds a bit of a grudge when I give our brother, Michael, a good gift, but he’s easier to buy for because we’re closer in age and he’s a guy. It’s true that Elsie is really good with my birthday. She has always been a super-thoughtful big sister. One year she got me this amazing gold chain that I had wanted for ages. I thought my parents were getting it for me, but Elsie told me she wanted it to be from her. She loves the feeling of being a good gift-giver, and I wouldn’t want to take that role away from her. It’s just that Elsie secretly wants me to repay her for all the presents she gets me and I am just not on her level. I also don’t have her budget: I’m in a low-paid, entry-level job, while Elsie is a manager. I’ll try to step it up, because I want to preserve our relationship, but she can’t expect me to match her. That’s not what giving presents is about, after all. Should Ollie make more effort when buying gifts? It’s Ollie’s lack of effort that upsets Elsie most, not the price tag – especially as he makes more of an effort for their brother. Ollie is aware his thoughtlessness upsets Elsie, so there is no excuse. He is guilty and should up his game.Nadine, 56 Elsie is looking for commercial solutions to what is an existential problem. She should consider having an actual conversation with her brother rather than papering over the cracks in their relationship with vouchers.Jac, 29 Overall, I side with Ollie. You give gifts because you want to give, not because you want something similar in return. Not everyone shows their feelings for others like this, so Elsie should take a broader perspective. However, Ollie should mark her birthday somehow as it clearly matters to her.Michael, 52 Ollie’s excuse of “girls are really hard to shop for” is really poor. Aside from this, Elsie needs to accept that gift giving is dependent on our ability to spend. She’s thoughtful and puts her heart into it, but her demand for equal gifts takes some of that away.Nicole, 35 Elsie says “he should already know what to get me”. Why should he? He is a 24-year-old single bloke! They need hints, or a list of possibilities. Maybe Elsie could prime her mum with a few suggestions in advance (within Ollie’s price range, of course) and she could tactfully pass them on.Carol, 83 So now you can be the judge, click on the poll below to tell us: should Ollie get Elsie better birthday presents?

1/21/2022,"At the height of the pandemic, Farrukh Sair worked on a temporary contract as an NHS IT engineer, setting up computer systems in hospital wards converted to accommodate Covid patients and reconfiguring laptops so that NHS staff were equipped to work from home. In Sonita Gale’s new documentary, Hostile, Sair explains why he has kept hold of his NHS lanyard. “It reminds me I have been part of something good,” he says. Clinging on to this evidence is important to Sair because elsewhere in his life things are not going so well. After 19 years in the UK, he has had to spend more than £50,000 on Home Office visa fees and legal bills to try to regularise his immigration status. He is still fighting for the right to remain. Both his children were born here, but the whole family could face removal proceedings if his most recent application is refused later this year.  Sair has confronted some of the most unwelcoming aspects of the Home Office’s hostile environment – a series of policy measures designed to tackle illegal immigration, but which frequently have made life barely tolerable for migrants living here legally. Since moving from Pakistan in 2003 to study at the University of Manchester, Sair has worked continuously in various IT roles (apart from an eight-month period when officials decided to remove his right to work). But his application to remain permanently has been refused several times on contentious technicalities; he has attended six court hearings to attempt to resolve the case. “They are asking for the brightest and the best to come here, however I am already here and they are trying to get rid of me, which doesn’t really make any sense,” he says. Much of the Home Office decision-making highlighted in this film seems not to make sense, unless it is seen as part of a deliberate policy to make life in the UK profoundly difficult for people with an unresolved immigration application. Sair’s immigration status means that the family has no recourse to public funds – the initialism NRPF is marked on their files – so they have no access to benefit payments, his children are not eligible for free school meals and no one in the family is eligible for free NHS healthcare (despite Sair’s role as a frontline essential worker during the worst of the Covid crisis). The family is heavily in debt. It is a bold step to make a feature-length documentary about technical details of immigration policies that even senior politicians find hard to understand. Gale’s film includes footage of Boris Johnson revealing blithely that he has no understanding of NRPF, despite the fact that this immigration status – which excludes hundreds of thousands of people in the UK from social welfare – pushed international students and professionals into destitution during the pandemic when they lost work and were unable to claim unemployment benefit. The film was longlisted for the outstanding debut Bafta this month and Gale hopes that it will raise awareness of the human impact of Britain’s ever-tightening immigration policies. “People know we’ve got an environmental crisis, but we’ve also got a humanity crisis. I wanted to show the broken system, so people will start thinking about how it can be fixed,” she says. Hostile also features Anthony Bryan, a Windrush victim who was sacked after wrongly being classified as an illegal immigrant, spent five weeks in immigration detention and was almost deported to Jamaica – a country he had left as a child half a century earlier. He is still struggling to rebuild his life. A huge amount of content is covered at dizzying speed and the bleak subject matter makes the film hard to watch. But Gale’s portrayal of Sair’s predicament is so clear and powerful that the pointless human damage wrought by these complex policies is laid bare. We see Sair sitting at a table at home, day after day, sifting through piles of neatly sorted immigration applications, tax records and bank details, juggling his debts and working out how to save enough money (about £12,000) to pay for the next application for a visa for his family. “Waiting is not like hurting you physically, but it is torture mentally,” he says. He keeps three printers in the attic – his main one, a spare one and a backup ready to be recommissioned in case of emergency. Printing thousands of pages of forms and evidence is a central part of the head-spinning immigration application process. While the rest of his house is immaculate, Sair’s attic is a tip and he is reluctant to tidy it. “It reflects the confusion of my life,” he says. When I spoke to him on the phone this week, Sair said: “We don’t know what tomorrow will bring. My children only speak English and we could still face removal to Pakistan, a place they’ve never lived.” He is pleased to have been involved in the film, even though it has exposed the misery through which his family continues to live. “It was very emotional to see it. I don’t have any convictions; I don’t even have points on my driving licence. Rather than thinking about what I’ve contributed to this country, they stick to these tick-box exercises. I’m still struggling to stay.” The Home Office said it was unable to comment on Sair’s case due to a pending appeal.

1/21/2022,"Spending by consumers in Great Britain dropped by almost 4% in December as the arrival of the Omicron variant kept people away from the shops, official figures show. In a key month for retailers, sales volumes dropped by 3.7% in an across-the-board slump that included food, clothing and footwear, household goods and department stores.  Retailers had seen some Christmas spending brought forward to November when a 1% monthly rise was helped by Black Friday bargains. Even so, the December fall was much sharper than the 0.6% drop forecast by the financial markets. Bethany Beckett, a UK analyst at Capital Economics, said: “The huge 3.7% month-on-month fall in retail sales in December was much bigger than we and the consensus had expected and supports our view that the surge in Omicron Covid-19 cases in the run-up to Christmas may have dragged down GDP by 0.5% month on month, if not more.” Beckett added that the 4.7% monthly drop in fuel sales was consistent with people staying at home rather than risking a trip to the high street. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the monthly fall in the last month of 2021 still left retail sales 2.6% above their pre-pandemic level in February 2020. Heather Bovill, the ONS deputy director for surveys and economic indicators, said feedback from retailers showed a clear Omicron effect. “As plan B restrictions in England meant more people working from home, there was a notable fall for fuel sales. “However, despite the fall in December, retail sales are still stronger than before the pandemic, with over a quarter of sales now made online.” In 2021 as a whole, the volume of retail sales rose by 5.1%, the highest annual growth since 2004, but the ONS said the figures should be treated with caution because of the fall in high street activity during 2020. Over the three months to December 2021, considered by the ONS to be a better guide to the trend than monthly comparisons, retail sales volumes were down 0.2% on the previous quarter, and 0.9% lower than in the final three months of 2020.",News/Business,Retail sales in Great Britain fall as Omicron keeps shoppers away,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/21/retail-sales-in-great-britain-fall-as-omicron-keeps-shoppers-away
1/21/2022,"People have always dressed above their station, and other people have always minded terribly. In 1913 the American reformer Bertha June Richardson was taken aback to discover that the girls whom she encountered in the New York tenements looked smarter than she did, with “everything about them in the latest style”. Unlike many of her pursed-lipped contemporaries, though, Richardson worked hard to understand what was really going on. The Smith graduate and author of The Woman Who Spends: A Study of Her Economic Function, concluded that these immigrant girls, many of them earning no more than $6 a week in the rag trade, were enacting their particular version of the American dream, one silk petticoat and puffy sleeve at a time.  One of the great pleasures of this panoramic history of getting dressed is Sofi Thanhauser’s ability to spot moments like these where human desire and material culture collide. When Molière wrote The Bourgeois Gentilhomme in 1670 about a burgher whose ambition to rise into the nobility requires him to get some fancy new outfits, audience members got the joke because they knew someone just like that and it was a relief, finally, to be allowed to snigger. A century later the script was flipped when Marie Antoinette attempted a bit of cross-class cosplay of her own. Enthralled by Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s back-to-nature philosophy, the queen built her own toy farm in the grounds of Versailles and started a fashion for peasant costume among the ladies of her court. Not only was impersonating Bo Peep in the Hall of Mirrors a tone-deaf move, it decimated the domestic silk industry, throwing hundreds of Lyonnais artisans out of work. Without meaning to, the queen’s newfound passion for imported white muslin brought her a step or two closer to the guillotine. Worn, though, consists of much more than a string of entertaining anecdotes about people raiding the dressing-up box and embarrassing themselves in the process. Its starting point is the terrible state of our current clothing industry, which, as Thanhauser describes it, exists in a nightmare wasteland of overproduction, toxic waste, choked rivers, child labour and collapsing factories. Following five threads – linen, cotton, silk, rayon and wool – she sets out to chart a deft course through material history, arguing that “there is scarcely a part of the human experience, historic or current, that the story of clothes does not touch”. In the early modern period Thanhauser paints a picture of pioneering Americans growing their own clothes, literally: taking the wool from their sheep and flax from their fields to spin and weave at home. By the 19th century, production had moved into factories, at least in Britain where Manchester had become “Cottonopolis”, a smoky behemoth that devoured cotton imported from the southern American slave states before belching out finished fabric to captive colonial markets. From here it was a short step to today’s globalised system, where cotton is harvested using forced labour in China’s Xinjiang province, processed heaven-knows-where (the supply chains are kept purposely opaque) before being pinged back in the form of limp identikit clothing to the malls and online hubs of the US and western Europe. None of this is logistically or morally simple and the great virtue of Thanhauser’s analysis is how alive she is to the difficulty of making these networks legible, even when they lie relatively close to come. As her test case, Thanhauser, who lives in New York, travels to Texas where America’s modern cotton industry is based. At first sight there may no longer be slave labour of the kind that Georgia and the Carolinas depended on two centuries ago, but the underlying patterns have not changed greatly. The workforce is overwhelmingly Latino, 75% of whom are undocumented, which means that when Parkinson’s and leukaemia start to show up as a consequence of constant exposure to pesticides, these young men have spotty access to health care and almost no legal redress. And they are young. The average life expectancy for Latino farmworkers in the US is 49, compared to 73 to 79 for the rest of the population.Thanhauser’s approach to exposing a system gone so horribly wrong is to synthesise the existing literature, add fresh insights drawn from her own fieldwork, and deliver the findings in a richly evocative narrative powered, but never overwhelmed, by a sense of righteous anger. Her methodology is very similar to that pioneered by Michael Pollan 15 years ago in his In Defense of Food: An Eater’s Manifesto. When it comes to solutions, though, Thanhauser has a harder job. Pollan’s take-home dictum, “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants”, works less well in the closet than it does in the kitchen. For while there’s no denying the current renaissance of craft and making in the west, it seems unlikely that many of us will ever want to spend our evenings learning how to sew bust darts or set in a sleeve. Thanhauser’s suggestions, instead, are more doable. Perhaps we could think about using local tailors to get things made. Or try becoming more committed vintage shoppers. And then there’s the simplest yet most radical approach of all, which involves performing a ruthless new year cull of our wardrobes with a view, this time, to not immediately filling them up again with yet more tat.
