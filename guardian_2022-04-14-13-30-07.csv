4/14/2022,"My name is Oleksandr Ruchko and I am a birdwatcher. Because I am 59 years old, I still have another few months when I can be called into action by the military recruitment office, to fight in the war with Russia. Lately I have been providing birdwatching tours around the parks in Lviv, my home. The tours are with refugees who have come here from cities around Ukraine, including Kyiv and Kharkiv. They have lost their homes and some have lost family members. I’m trying to help them to be calm, and take a break from thinking about what is happening. Spring is the best time for birdwatching here. You can hear the song of flycatchers, wrens, black redstarts and yellowhammers, and all the migrants are coming back to breed, including swifts, house martins, chiffchaffs, golden orioles and cuckoos. The most famous one is the white stork, Ukraine’s national bird. The stork is very sacred to Ukrainians, a symbol of spring, of babies, and of peace. They are believed to be a kind of amulet, and protect your house against evil. Nobody here ever kills storks to eat, not even in the worst times like the Holodomor or the Holocaust. At the moment, because of the war, it is a problem to watch birds with binoculars or telescopes. Any person using these things will cause suspicion, so we must use our ears and eyes instead. Nobody wants to look like a spy. But sometimes you only need your ears and eyes. My wife and I were driving back from the Carpathian mountains last week, where we had gone for a few days to escape the air-raid sirens. Near to the village of Rozvadiv, we saw above us a group of storks, gliding in the sky with no effort. They looked like aristocrats, calm and sure of themselves. The area is attractive for storks because of the Dniester river – its valley has lots of swamps and small ponds which have the right food. This was a good sign, I thought. It meant that despite the snow in the fields, spring had finally arrived. But maybe they will bring us peace soon too. The flying bird is the ultimate symbol of freedom. They don’t know borders, they need no visas or permissions to spend winter in Egypt then come back to Ukraine. And we are all happy that they are back safely, giving us hope for better times.

4/14/2022,"The foster mother of missing child William Tyrrell provided a NSW Crime Commission hearing about the boy’s disappearance with false or misleading information, police have alleged. On Thursday, detectives from strike force Rosann – which was established to investigate Tyrrell’s disappearance – issued a 56-year-old woman with a court attendance notice. The woman – understood to be Tyrrell’s foster mother – will have her matter heard at Sydney’s Downing Centre local court on 24 May. William Tyrrell was last seen playing at his foster grandmother’s home in northern New South Wales in September 2014, when he was three years old. Thursday’s charge is the latest in a string of recent developments linked to the investigation. In a statement released on Thursday, NSW police said the woman was charged with knowingly giving false or misleading evidence. Guardian Australia understands this occurred at a hearing before the NSW Crime Commission – a body that works alongside police to investigate serious crimes. “She remains before the courts,” the police statement said. “Investigations under strike force Rosann continue.” A years-long investigation into Tyrrell’s disappearance – which included digging up key sites in the town he was last seen in at the end of last year – continues. His disappearance was also the subject of a coronial inquest. In March, a man understood to be Tyrrell’s foster father was charged with a similar allegation in relation to information he provided to the NSW Crime Commission. He has already pleaded not guilty to the charges. Neither of the foster parents can be named for legal reasons. In a separate matter unrelated to the NSW Crime Commission charges, the foster parents were last year charged with the alleged common assault of a child who was not William Tyrrell. They both pleaded not guilty. The charges are not connected to Tyrell’s disappearance.",News/Australia news,William Tyrrell’s foster mother charged with giving misleading evidence,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/14/william-tyrrells-foster-mother-charged-with-giving-misleading-evidence
4/14/2022,"There’s an election on, so it’s time to get right into some details about climate and energy policy. Right? In a Facebook post this week, the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, claimed that Labor “plans to force the nation’s top 200 largest energy users and producers to cut their aggregate emissions by 25% by 2030”. Taylor was referring to Labor’s plan to modify the Morrison government’s safeguard mechanism – a policy that was supposed to cap emissions from industrial facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year by requiring them to purchase carbon credits if they exceeded an emissions baseline. Emissions covered by the mechanism have actually gone up since it was introduced in 2016. But is Labor planning to “force” these companies (there are actually 212 of them currently) to cut their emissions by 25% by 2030? The short answer is no. In the last financial year, the 212 facilities covered by the mechanism emitted 136.9m tonnes of CO2-equivalent. What Labor wants to do if elected is adopt an idea from the Business Council of Australia (BCA) to lower the baseline of emissions allowed under the scheme each year. If a facility emits less than its agreed baseline, it would be rewarded with credits. If it emits more, it would have to purchase them. Modelling of Labor’s policy presumed it would lower the baseline for emissions across the entire scheme by 5m tonnes a year. In a statement, Labor’s climate and energy spokesman, Chris Bowen, accused Taylor of “making up policies” just days after the election campaign had started. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He told Temperature Check the changes were geared to “work on a trajectory to net zero by 2050” and this was a target that “more than two-thirds of these companies already have”. Labor has also said it would take advice from the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources and the Clean Energy Regulator on how reductions would be shared between facilities, because some industries have more options to cut emissions than others. Taylor was posting from an alumina refinery in Western Australia run by South 32 – one of the 212 facilities. The company, which is a member of the same BCA that first proposed the changes to the safeguard mechanism, has a goal to halve its emissions by 2035. According to the Clean Energy Regulator, emissions at the refinery were below its cap under the mechanism last year. A spokesperson for the minister said: “Go read Labor’s modelling of their industry policy and then ask them if they agree.” In a follow-up text they said the 25% figure was “derived from Labor’s own modelling”. There’s a project called Climate 200 that supports independent election candidates who want to see faster and deeper cuts to emissions, and would push for greater integrity and transparency in government. The organisation – convened by Simon Holmes à Court – is getting plenty of media as independents could hold the balance of power if there is a tight result on 21 May. Several of the more than 20 independents Climate 200 says it is backing are in seats held by high-profile Liberals, such as Monique Ryan in Josh Frydenberg’s seat of Kooyong and Zoe Daniel running in Goldstein against the assistant energy minister, Tim Wilson. The group says it gives funding, strategic advice and analytical support. This week the Australian ran an editorial repeatedly claiming Climate 200 was a political party, saying: “Despite claims by Mr Holmes à Court that Climate 200 is not a political party, it is defined and treated as one by the Australian Electoral Commission.” Anyone can check this, including the editorial writers at the Australian, but just to be sure, Temperature Check asked the commission if it “defined and treated” Climate 200 as a political party. A statement said: “Climate 200 is not a registered political party but rather a registered Significant Third Party – as per the registers available on our Transparency Register.” A significant third party is a group spending more than $250,000 in a financial year on elections. They are required to register with the AEC and comply with certain financial disclosure and donations rules. Among them are unions, specialist interest groups and a campaign called Advance Australia that thinks the country is “under siege by stupid laws and woke ideologies like ‘net zero’”. hey, if anyone is speaking with chris dore, editor-in-chief of the @australian, please show him this: pic.twitter.com/Kacw5vSJsC Question: when does an extension of a coalmine’s life to 2044, which will send 230m tonnes of CO2-equivalent into the atmosphere, have no impact on the climate crisis? Answer: when you are one of the world’s biggest mining companies trying to get final approval in New South Wales. The project in question is Glencore’s Glendell Continued Operations project, currently before the NSW Independent Planning Commission for a final decision. The former Australian chief scientist Prof Penny Sackett gave evidence to the commission, arguing the emissions over the lifetime of the project would make the climate crisis worse and make it harder to keep global heating to 1.5C. Glencore has said the mining, transportation and burning of the coal – for both power generation and steel-making – will emit 230m tonnes of CO2-e over its lifetime. In a response sent to the commission last week Glencore didn’t argue with Sackett’s claims, but said “if the coal is not mined at the Glendell Mine, the demand for this product would be met through coal mined elsewhere”. Because of this, Glencore said, if the commission approved the mine the net increase in climate related costs would be “zero”. Prof Jacqueline Peel, a climate litigation expert at the University of Melbourne, says this argument is what has became known in legal cases as the “market substitution” defence. She said in NSW courts there was sufficient precedent that she considered such an argument would likely now fail. In 2019, Justice Brian Preston in the NSW land and environment court took on the same argument made by Gloucester Resources over its proposed Rocky Hill coalmine. “There is also a logical flaw in the market substitution assumption,” Preston said. “If a development will cause an environmental impact that is found to be unacceptable, the environmental impact does not become acceptable because a hypothetical and uncertain alternative development might also cause the same unacceptable environmental impact. The environmental impact remains unacceptable regardless of where it is caused.”",News/Environment,Does Labor plan to force the top 200 energy users and producers to cut emissions by 25%? | Temperature Check,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/14/does-labor-plan-to-force-the-top-200-energy-users-and-producers-to-cut-emissions-by-25
4/14/2022,"The late Australian Rev Ted Noffs, nominally Methodist, embraced the rich kaleidoscope of chaos that comes with championing the discarded and downtrodden. He was accused by his own church hierarchy of heresy for his disavowal of doctrine that Christ’s suffering would save the world; he believed, as demonstrated by his deeds, that we on Earth could save ourselves. Ministering to misfits – itinerant people, sex workers, drug users and the mentally shattered – Noffs founded the Wayside Chapel in Sydney’s Kings Cross in 1964, personally marrying thousands of couples in the face of bigotry against interreligious and interracial unions. Among the people he married was writer Alana Valentine’s late mother and stepfather. In photographs from the wedding day, her mother, Janice looks happy, having “found someone to marry her and take on her kids”, we learn in Valentine’s new play, Wayside Bride, co-directed by Hannah Goodwin and Eamon Flack. Valentine specialises in verbatim theatre: interviewing real-life subjects then basing her plays upon these conversations. For this funny and profoundly relevant new work, interviews begin at home, as we meet fictionalised versions of adult Alana and Janice, played by Emily Goddard and Sacha Horler. Janice’s shell has hardened over the years, clamming up when Alana tries to interview her mother about her Wayside wedding: sentimentality, she chides, won’t grant the playwright perception or insight. But then, the stage version of Alana dons her mother’s wedding dress as a second skin – going “undercover in my own play”, she quips – and time travels to meet others who passed through Noffs’ earthly waystation. Wayside Bride becomes a tribute to real love and belonging, as well as a paean to Noffs’ notion of accepting, rather than trying to “fix”, people, while also acknowledging the wrinkles: the devotion of Noffs and his wife, Margaret, to the forgotten people of inner Sydney came at the expense of time spent on their marriage and with their children. An ensemble of 10 actors performs multiple roles: best selves, shadow selves, self-loathing selves. Horler switches from playing Janice to Margaret,while Brandon McClelland plays Ted, in a powder-blue safari suit with brown tie and white shoes. Both actors are dynamic on stage, imbuing the couple with dramatic force and appealing humour. The real Ted died in 1995, but Margaret died only last December at the age of 95, prompting Valentine to write “this was the passing of a great Australian, a compassionate, extraordinary person who, no less than Ted, was responsible for the establishment of the remarkable Wayside Chapel”. There is authenticity and warmth in Valentine’s carousel of humanity: Wiradjuri and Yuin actor Angeline Penrith plays Justine, spirited and full of life despite believing her mother abandoned her in the crib; she later learns she was stolen from her mother, a cruelty inflicted on many Indigenous Australians. Marco Chiappi plays wide-eyed, gesticulating Sean, sleeping with his cockney bride-to-be Joan (Sandy Greenwood) in their car – then switches to playing a high-camp gay man who is inveigled by Margaret to walk a fatherless stranger down the aisle. Rebecca Massey wrings some of the funniest lines, playing an interjecting gossip in a beehive hairdo, then a risque actor, then a sex worker with the nom de plume Dusty, alongside her working girl pal Blossom (Greenwood again). And Maggie Blinco brings range as an archetypal mad woman, speaking poetry and paranoia, nonsense and great sense; and then as a dignified grandmother, who recalls her marriage at Wayside almost 50 years before to a Vietnamese Australian, whom her family struggled to accept because he was not white. A tightening of the script in a couple of spots might be useful. The name checking of a lot of Noffs’ contemporaries does not hold much dramatic interest. And given the presence of a juke box and several unplayed musical instruments around the stage, more music suggestive of the given era could have enhanced the first act in particular. People in all their permutations and at their most vulnerable are the heart of Wayside Bride, raw and unvarnished but rendered lovingly. Among those of us for whom conventional family life is less than ideal, we can picture ourselves in this misfit portrait. The final scene is a celebration of diversity, a perfect bouquet toss for these times. Wayside Bride is on at Belvoir Theatre until 29 May, alternating in repertoire with Caryl Churchill’s 1976 play Light Shining in Buckinghamshire, which plays until 28 May",Arts/Stage,Wayside Bride review – a loving tribute to an Australian religious rebel,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/14/wayside-bride-review-a-loving-tribute-to-an-australian-religious-rebel
4/14/2022,"Alongside endangered birds, abnormally large sheep and – in the popular imagination – hairy-toed hobbits, New Zealand is a haven for another curious specimen: the illicit flow of offshore finance. The world’s fraudsters and tax dodgers channel funds through the Pacific island nation at a rate quite at odds with its squeaky-clean, highly ethical global image. New Zealand’s latest attempt to make reality match reputation came late last month, as the commerce minister, David Clark, pledged to introduce a publicly accessible register that would list the true (“beneficial”) owners of New Zealand-based companies. Such a move would represent a form of catch-up – Britain has had one since 2016 – and has long been urged by global bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Much international fraud relies on something known as “the shell game”, in which income and assets are funnelled through a series of interlinked “shell” companies, partnerships and trusts. The aim is to keep the true owner of the wealth secret, so that anti-corruption bodies and tax authorities cannot track down their bribery payments or require them to pay tax. Hence why many global bodies now refer to “secrecy jurisdictions” rather than “tax havens”. Organisations like the Tax Justice Network have found New Zealand to be a player, albeit a small one, in the market for secretive offshore finance. Official analysis shows at least $1.35bn of income for money-laundering is generated inside New Zealand each year. Crucially, though, authorities have no idea how much is channelled into or through the country by global fraudsters using New Zealand-registered companies. Such fraudsters are, a 2021 FATF report found, using the country’s reputation as “a well-regulated jurisdiction” to disguise their activities. Local business reporting is replete with stories of overseas investors who have put their money into vehicles registered in New Zealand, believing this guarantees a high degree of scrutiny – only to find otherwise. Some of the problems stem from the country’s 1980s pro-market reforms, in which “light-touch” regulation was one of the dominant mantras. The country likes to boast of its number one ranking in the World Bank’s “ease of doing business” survey. The flipside, the FATF argues, is that its companies are unusually “vulnerable to abuse” because the cost of setting one up is kept low partly by regulators doing so little due diligence. In a statement, Clark said his proposed register “will go a long way” towards improving transparency of company ownership. The registers are not flawless, however. If New Zealand follows overseas practice and defines a true owner as someone with a 25% stake in a company, five people could hold 20% each and declare none of their names. And except where there are major “red flags”, officials do not propose to check whether those registering are indeed the beneficial owners of their firms. New Zealanders also make sweeping use of family trusts. These are arrangements in which an individual (the “settlor”) has in theory put aside assets for trustees to run on behalf of others – but in practice often still controls the assets. Family trusts have been used to avoid tax and hide assets from creditors and former spouses. New Zealand’s four million adults have set up somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 such trusts – but no one knows the true figure, because they do not have to be registered. If, under Clark’s proposed law, a trust is the true owner of a company, it will have to disclose the name of the trustees – but not the settlor, which business commentators fear will leave a major gap in transparency. There are concerns however that the proposed register will be weakened before it actually reaches the statute books, based on New Zealand’s recent efforts to tackle corruption. Michael Macaulay, a professor of public administration at Victoria University of Wellington, points out that, “Every single time, we have ended up with either a watered-down version or nothing at all.” He cites an abandoned attempt to create a register of lobbyists, draft legislation that fails to properly support whistleblowers, and anti-bribery laws that still permit bribes in certain circumstances. New Zealand’s complicity in international fraud was also exposed by the 2016 Panama Papers, in which illicit global wealth was shown to be hidden through its “foreign trust” regime. This allowed foreigners to place assets in trusts that were based in New Zealand but did not have to disclose information about their activities. These trusts were caught up in scandals ranging from the multi-billion-dollar Malaysian 1MDB fraud to the notorious Brazilian “Lavo Jato” (“Carwash”) corruption case. Commentators began describing New Zealand as a tax haven and even, in the words of International Consortium of Investigative Journalists director Gerard Ryle, “a soft touch”. Discomfited by this criticism, the government cracked down on the foreign-trust regime, requiring far more information to be shared with tax authorities and cutting the number of those registered by three-quarters. Multiple weaknesses remain, however. The 2021 FATF assessment highlighted vulnerabilities including “major” risks caused by the failure to properly regulate nominee directors and shareholders, who often effectively hold – or hide – assets on behalf of others. Illicit activity was being carried out through not just shell companies but also trusts, the taskforce found, urging that the latter be registered as well as the former. New Zealand would be wise to act on these issues, as global public opinion continues to turn against secrecy states and the illicit activities they enable. The so-called transparency paradox applies, however: greater openness can improve a country’s reputation long-term but damage it short-term, as the extent of wrongdoing becomes apparent. New Zealand has not been willing to run this risk in the past; no one should be overly confident it will do so in future.
