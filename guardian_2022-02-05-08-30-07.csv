2/5/2022,"Police have a photograph of Boris Johnson holding a can of beer at his lockdown birthday party in June 2020, according to reports. It is understood to be among the 300 pictures submitted to the Metropolitan police by Sue Gray for their investigation into social gatherings which breached coronavirus regulations.  The prime minister is pictured with a can of Estrella beer standing next to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in No 10’s Cabinet Room, the Mirror has been told. It was reported that the picture was taken by the prime minister’s official taxpayer-funded photographer, who was documenting the event in June 2020. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, told the newspaper: “The Downing Street photographer is funded by the taxpayer, and the public have every right to see the photos they pay to have taken, including any of the prime minister’s birthday party. “Following the Met police investigation, the Sue Gray report must be published in its entirety with all accompanying evidence – photos, videos and testimony.” Last month Downing Street acknowledged that staff “gathered briefly” at a surprise birthday celebration organised by Carrie Johnson but said that the prime minister only stayed for 10 minutes. The chancellor is understood to have attended the event as he turned up for a Covid meeting, but had not been invited. Sources told the Mirror that Johnson and Sunak were surrounded by No 10 aides in the Cabinet Room but there was no birthday cake. Barrister Adam Wagner, an expert in Covid laws, said: “The legal question for the prime minister is whether he participated in the gathering. The fact that he was photographed holding a beer strongly suggests he did and therefore committed a criminal offence of the regulations.” Downing Street said it could not comment due to the ongoing police investigation. It comes after four of Johnson’s senior aides resigned in the space of 24 hours on Thursday. His policy chief Munira Mirza, the director of communications Jack Doyle, the principal private secretary Martin Reynolds and the chief of staff Dan Rosenfield all quit. There was pressure on Doyle and Reynolds to resign after their involvement in two Downing Street gatherings during lockdown emerged.",News/Politics,"Police have photo of Boris Johnson with beer at lockdown party, say reports",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/police-have-photo-of-boris-johnson-with-beer-at-lockdown-party-say-reports
2/5/2022,"On a night when Old Trafford’s concourse caterers went down, Manchester United made a complete hash of what had appeared a cruise of a victory over Middlesbrough. Ralf Rangnick’s side were knocked out 8-7 on penalties, the unfortunate Anthony Elanga missing the decisive kick but, really this was a defeat borne from them seriously losing the plot in the second half. If Matt Crooks’s 64th-minute strike that levelled out Jadon Sancho’s opener was controversial as it came courtesy of a Duncan Watmore handball ruled accidental and thus legal, United’s serial missing of chances – including a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty - and inability to control the contest was to blame for the reverse.  For this fourth round tie in the one competition United might realistically claim, Rangnick could select Paul Pogba for the first time, the Frenchman back after 15 games out with a thigh problem. He lined up on the left of the midfield trident in a 4-3-3 Middlesbrough hoped to thwart, via Chris Wilder’s three centre-back shape, before 9,000-plus of their travelling fans. They were nearly silenced one minute in, as Luke Shaw’s high ball was fumbled by Joe Lumley at his area’s edge. Ronaldo touched it on and Sancho’s cute chip on a diagonal came back off the bar. This was as bright an augury as the Diogo Dalot pass which encouraged Marcus Rashford to rush forward in pursuit, though Lumley this time collected cleanly. United were in a mode not often seen so early on: a high gear that tore through Middlesbrough, who had no answer to their hosts quick and slick play. The home faithful’s next “oohs” were prompted by a Ronaldo bicycle kick he hit straight at the busy Lumley. At kick-off Pogba’s season in numbers for club and country read 17 appearances, seven assists, no goals, and a red card. Rangnick has been encouraged by his showing in training and a thrust that drew a free-kick, a slide tackle on Folarin Balogun and the dragging of markers around to create space hinted at a keenness for the fray. All of this preceded Pogba claiming a penalty after he drifted into the area, took Shaw’s pass and was pulled down by Anfernee Dijksteel. What occurred next, though, was Ronaldo missing the spot-kick to Lumley’s right, the Stretford End’s cheers of anticipation for their hero muted instantly. Moments later the disappointment faded. Bruno Fernandes had spurned a close-range chance but now drilled a ball into the effervescent Sancho from halfway. A mis-control took him wide but his effort – deflecting slightly off Isaiah Jones – went through Lumley’s arms and in. This was a deserved goal for United, who were rampant and had cast Middlesbrough as bystanders unable to affect the contest. In Fernandes they had chief orchestrator, his next defence-splitting ball releasing Ronaldo along a left channel. The No 7 blazed at Lumley and he saved, but the Teessiders were desperate to survive without conceding again before half-time, when they could grab a breather and look to regroup somehow. They made it, just about, three Shaw corners in succession from the right failing to create a second goal that would surely have demoralised the side seventh in the Championship – Rashford tingling Lumley’s fingers from the last of these. A PA announcement informed the crowd that no food or drink could be served at the interval “due to a technical fault” which caused disgruntlement and a chant of “Glazers Out” directed at United’s unpopular owners from some fans. They could be happier with the hunger their team continued showing in the second half – Scott McTominay, Fernandes and Sancho hunting the ball down in one vignette. The message being sent to Wilder’s men would have been more ruthless, though, if Rashford, then Ronaldo, had not spurned chances that were akin to the “gimme” category of tap-in putts for golfers. This underlined how United’s inability to finish off those in green off could still bite them in the proverbial and cause them regret. Wilder’s team were enjoying their best phase illustrated by Pogba having to intervene in his area as Crooks lurked once more. And, now, the latter did equalise. Watmore, a former United youngster just on as a replacement, handled Jones’s pass before playing in Crooks who scored. United could blame only themselves. A next hapless moment came when Fernandes hit the post when it was, patently, simpler to score, while Pogba’s later header while falling back from a Shaw corner summed up how Rangnick’s side had faded. For the closing minutes the German replaced Rashford and Sancho with Fred and Elanga. They did not affect the score, though, and so Taylor blew for normal time ahead of beginning the extra period.",Sport/Football,Middlesbrough knock Manchester United out of FA Cup on penalties,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/manchester-united-middlesbrough-fa-cup-match-report
2/5/2022,"Antonio Conte says Tottenham are still a long way from where he wants them to be as he delivered a scathing assessment of the club’s transfer market mistakes. The manager thinks small steps towards clearing up the mess were made in January with the signings of Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur from Juventus; players to make the squad more complete, to add depth in areas where it was needed. He said that Kulusevski could play at right wing-back, an area he was extremely keen to strengthen, as well as in attacking midfield. Bentancur will compete in central midfield.  But Conte did not hold back as he reflected on how the club had loaned out three recent signings during the window, including Bryan Gil, who only joined last July from Sevilla for £21.6m in a deal that saw Érik Lamela move in the opposite direction. A fourth player – Dele Alli – was sold permanently to Everton. Gil has gone to Valencia until the end of the season while Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso have been loaned to Lyon and Villarreal. Spurs spent just under £60m when they took Ndombele from Lyon in the summer of 2019 while Lo Celso cost them about £57m from Real Betis at the same time, initially on loan. “For sure, it was strange to send [three] on loan and sell one player in January because it means something went wrong in the past,” Conte said. “Usually you have to buy players to reinforce your team. But if you send away players on loan you bought in the last two or three years, it means maybe you did something wrong. It will be very important to not make mistakes in the future because in this moment many teams are higher than us.” Asked whether he had expected so many departures, Conte said: “Before arriving at Tottenham [last November], I considered all the players to be important. We paid a lot for Ndombele and it was the same for Lo Celso and Gil. Then when you’re in the situation, you understand very well which is the best solution for the club and the players in this moment.” Gil has struggled to adapt to the physical demands of the Premier League, where the 20-year-old winger is yet to start a game. The situation is an embarrassment for Fabio Paratici, the managing director of football, who made him one of his first signings – albeit for a different manager, Nuno Espírito Santo. Conte suggested the club had not done their homework properly. “We’re talking about a really good player in Gil because he has good quality and he understands football quickly,” Conte said. “In this moment, this league is very tough [for him]. If you compare this league with other leagues, you play another sport here. “For this reason, when you go to sign a new player, you have to consider many aspects. You can be good with quality, you can be creative but, at the same time, you have to be strong physically. You have to run a lot, to be resilient. The impact of this league is not simple. You have to check many aspects and not go on emotional things.” Conte described Kulesevski, 21, and Bentancur, 24, as signings in line with the club’s philosophy who would develop and improve, but stressed they would need time. Both are fit for Saturday night’s FA Cup tie at home to Brighton, although neither is expected to start. “The path in front of us is long,” Conte said. “It’s important to understand this … that we want to start to go on this path. I don’t like [it] if you ask me about the race for the Champions League. My ambition is to win the league, not to go to the Champions League. My ambition is to be competitive, to fight to win. “At this moment I know very well that the situation is different. We are working very hard to try to improve the situation, to reduce the gap and also the mistakes of the past … to try to make good solutions [for them]. It’s important to know that this is a starting point. Honestly. And now we have to go if we want to go. Otherwise there are other solutions.” Conte said Alli’s move was good for all parties as the player needed a new challenge. Asked if he was satisfied with the club’s January business, he said they had tried their best and it was not an easy window.",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte delivers scathing review of Tottenham’s transfer mistakes,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/antonio-conte-scathing-tottenham-transfer-mistakes
2/5/2022,"Steve Bruce has said he is determined to shed his tag as a firefighter after returning to management at West Brom following a draining spell in the north-east. Bruce believes Newcastle supporters may look back on mid-table finishes during his reign differently in time, but after signing an 18-month contract at the Hawthorns his priority is to help a flailing team conquer the Championship by winning his fifth promotion from the division.  Bruce said a four-month break from the game allowed for a much-needed rest. He spent some time watching cricket in Dubai and was due to attend England’s three Test matches in the Caribbean next month, as well as go on safari in the Serengeti, but has cancelled those plans to return to the dugout. “There is going to be a lot written about the Newcastle thing but as far as I’m concerned it’s gone,” Bruce said. “It was tough, don’t get me wrong, but it’s an experience that I’m still glad I had and finishing 12th and 13th in the Premier League, maybe in 10 years’ time they’ll think: ‘Maybe you didn’t do that bad a job.’ I was waiting for the right opportunity. The break has recharged the batteries again.” Bruce was sacked by Newcastle in October after the Saudi Arabian-led takeover and revealed he has since turned down jobs in England and abroad. The 61-year-old said a return to the second tier, from which he has twice won promotion with both Birmingham and Hull, appealed because it is a “fair race” compared with the predictable nature of the Premier League. “Usually you get a team at the bottom,” he said of being appointed midway through the season. “I always seem to be firefighting. This is a different opportunity for me. I’ve come in, the team are in the top six, so I don’t think that has ever happened to me before. I usually get a job when a team is in crisis. We’re not in crisis. We’ve had a bad run, and the club has decided to change. I’m here to try and give the whole place a lift and win some matches and see if we can get in the Premier League.” Bruce took charge of his first training session on Friday and has named his son, Alex, who joined Macclesfield as a player in August, on his coaching staff, alongside Steve Agnew, his assistant manager, and Stephen Clemence. “My son is young, hungry and desperate to do well,” said Bruce, who started his managerial career at Sheffield United in 1998. “He has taken his badges. It is a bit like when I took Stephen Clemence, when he was finished [from playing] at 32, I always think when you’ve got a grey top that you need a bit of youth around you at times as well.” West Brom are sixth, eight points off the automatic promotion places after winning three of their past 13 matches. Bruce said he thought West Brom were a “knock-in bet” to be promoted after watching their opening game of the season at Bournemouth but acknowledged he needs to galvanise the club after a frustrating couple of months that ultimately led to Valérien Ismaël being sacked as manager less than 12 months into a four-year contract. The newly appointed chief executive, Ron Gourlay, formerly a consultant who worked a couple of days per week at the club, admitted “underlying issues have been coming to the surface”. “We both know there is disgruntlement among the fan base and we want to repair that if we can,” added Bruce. “I can do that by results, Ron can do that with his communications skills. We want to see if we can lift the doom and gloom a little bit and get the club back in the Premier League.”",Sport/Football,Recharged Steve Bruce plots new promotion push with West Brom,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/recharged-steve-bruce-plots-new-promotion-push-with-west-brom
2/5/2022,"Joining digital pile-ons, sending threatening social media posts and deliberately posting hoax bomb threats are among the new criminal offences that could result in jail sentences under proposed online safety laws. Tech firms will also be required to prevent users from being exposed to content such as revenge porn, fraud and the sale of illegal drugs, or face the threat of substantial fines under the proposed changes. Previously, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter had to take such content down if it was flagged to them but now they would be legally required to prevent users from being exposed to them in the first place.  The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, said: “We are listening to MPs, charities and campaigners who have wanted us to strengthen the legislation, and today’s changes mean we will be able to bring the full weight of the law against those who use the internet as a weapon to ruin people’s lives and do so quicker and more effectively.” The online safety bill is expected to be introduced to parliament over the next few months and is designed to protect users from harmful content. Under the changes brought forward by Dorries, the legislation will introduce three new online communications offences for individuals proposed by the Law Commission, an independent body that reviews laws in England and Wales. Those offences are: sending or posting a message that conveys a threat of serious harm, sending a communication with the intent of causing psychological harm or serious emotional distress, and deliberately sending a false message with the intention of causing harm. The government is introducing the offence of sending a genuinely threatening message, which would carry a sentence of up to five years, in order to “better capture online threats to rape, kill and inflict physical violence or cause people serious financial harm”. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it would offer better protection for public figures such as MPs, celebrities and footballers who regularly receive threatening posts and messages. The “psychological harm” offence, which carries a sentence of up to two years, is designed to cover a range of online incidents including Twitter pile-ons – where many people direct abuse at an individual – but also examples of threatening behaviour against women and girls, such as a domestic abuse survivor being tracked to their new location by their abuser and being sent a picture of their front door. Content posted by individuals on comment sections of websites, including newspapers, will be included within the scope of the offence. The false communications offence, which carries a maximum sentence of up to 51 weeks, covers messages or posts deliberately sent to inflict harm such as hoax bomb threats. However, the offender has to be aware that the message or post is untrue before sending it, so if that person posted on Facebook that people should inject themselves with Dettol to cure themselves of coronavirus the court would have to prove that the individual knew it was false information before putting it online. Dorries has moved to counter one of the most vociferous criticisms of the bill under its draft form, that it failed to make clear what constitutes the “illegal content” that users must be protected from. The DCMS has published an updated list of that content, which includes: revenge porn; promoting suicide; people smuggling; drug and weapons dealing; hate crime; fraud; and encouraging suicide. If tech platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube fail to shield people from encountering this kind of content, then they face substantial fines from the communications regulator charged with overseeing the act, Ofcom. Damian Collins MP, the Conservative chair of a joint committee of MPs and peers that scrutinised the bill, welcomed the changes, which echoed recommendations from the committee last year. “These changes will give social media businesses more clarity on what’s expected of them, and users more certainty that they will be protected, especially children. The prime minister made clear that he wanted this bill to be introduced in this session of parliament, and I look forward to speaking in favour of it soon.”",News/Society,Sending threatening posts among offences in revised online safety bill,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/04/sending-threatening-posts-among-offences-in-revised-online-safety-bill
2/5/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has described Luis Díaz’s transfer as evidence of Liverpool preparing for the future and for “pretty much all scenarios” with regard to their current forward line. Liverpool beat Tottenham to the signing of the exciting Colombia international in a deal that could rise to €60m, making Díaz the fourth most expensive recruit in the club’s history. Klopp expects the 25-year-old to have an immediate impact at Anfield and may hand the winger a debut against Cardiff in the FA Cup on Sunday. But the Liverpool manager also believes the club have protected themselves in the long-term with the deal for Díaz, with Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino all in the final 17 months of their contracts.  “First and foremost nothing happened apart from we brought in a really good player,” Klopp said. “It’s really nice to have these kind of options. We constantly prepare for today and for tomorrow as well. That is what our job has to be. The reaction of the players is always that they have to perform at the highest level. “Our players, even when we had injuries and only three available up front, they pushed themselves to an extreme extent absolutely all the time and that is why we were pretty successful in the last few years. “But we cannot hope that we get through this with three or four players. We need options and we need help. All development includes fresh blood as well and that’s what we did with Diogo [Jota] when he came here and now when we signed Luis it is exactly the same. “Players might have plans for their future but a club has to be ready for pretty much all scenarios and that’s what we do between playing games all the time. This club is too big to rely on single persons, whether that’s me or a player, and has to be ready for all different scenarios. We feel in a good place at this moment.” Díaz arrived in Liverpool on Friday. He still requires a work permit before being able to join the squad but, despite the process and recent international commitments, Klopp has not ruled out Díaz featuring on Sunday. The Liverpool manager, who will include Harvey Elliott in his squad for the first time since the 18-year-old dislocated an ankle in September, added: “If he had been here yesterday he could have trained a little bit and I would have definitely considered it. I don’t know, give me a second to meet him and to ask him how his last two or three days were! “It’s not easy to sit around in Paris waiting for the papers. It is not the best time in your life and doesn’t help you with recovery from the intense period he had with two games for Colombia and massive travel. I wouldn’t say no because I would be excited as well about giving him a few minutes in a sold-out Anfield, but let’s see.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp says Luis Díaz signing fits in with Liverpool’s long-term vision,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/jurgen-klopp-luis-diaz-liverpool-fa-cup-cardiff
2/5/2022,"David Moyes has warned Declan Rice’s suitors it will take “humungous money” to convince West Ham to sell the midfielder this summer. Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United are planning moves for Rice and there is a feeling that the 23-year-old could look to leave after West Ham made no signings during the January transfer window. The England international is determined to play in the Champions League and, although the London Stadium club remain in the hunt for a top-four place, there are concerns that last month’s inactivity could cause their season to fizzle out.  However Moyes is adamant that Rice, who rejected two contract offers from West Ham last year, is not for sale. The Scot dismissed reports about his captain leaving and he refused to accept that the east London side, who visit non-league Kidderminster Harriers in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Saturday, lacked ambition during the window. “Maybe people don’t have enough to write about,” Moyes said. “But I can’t do anything about what people write about Declan Rice. I can’t stop that, except say to them that you will need humungous money to get close. That’s what you would need to do. They can write all they like, but he’s here for certainly a few years. “But would we have liked to have added to the squad? Yes. We’ve tried to be ambitious. I want to take the club forward. I don’t want back-up players to give me extra in the squad. I didn’t need to pad the squad out.” West Ham, who are fifth in the league and through to the last 16 of the Europa League, had club-record bids for Benfica’s Darwin Núñez and Leeds’ Kalvin Phillips and Raphinha turned down. Moyes had funds available and he warned that Rice, who has two and a half years left on his current deal, with the option of another year, will cost a lot of money. “I said in the summer that I thought Declan Rice was £100m,” West Ham’s manager said. “That was the sales, that was cheap, that was your chance to get Declan Rice cheap. You can make your mind up what I’m talking about.” Moyes insisted that Rice is committed to the club. “I feel it. He’s like a special edition, Declan Rice, there’s not many like him. He’s a special player and for me he is probably the best midfield player in Europe at this present time.”",Sport/Football,West Ham manager David Moyes adamant Declan Rice will not be sold,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/west-ham-manager-david-moyes-adamant-declan-rice-will-not-be-sold
2/5/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has said he does not see Chelsea’s FA Cup tie against Plymouth Argyle as a chance to give experience to the club’s young prospects. Chelsea saw several talented academy players leave the club in search of regular football last summer and there is a desire to ensure that future generations do not head down the same path. Teddy Sharman-Lowe, Xavier Simons, Lewis Hall, Charlie Webster and Harvey Vale trained with the senior squad this week and there are hopes Tuchel will continue to make use of the academy. However, Chelsea’s manager will pick a strong team when the European champions look to reach the fifth round when they host League One opposition on Saturday evening, even though he agreed it was important for youngsters to see a route into the first team.  “In general yes, but tomorrow is not about youngsters,” Chelsea’s manager said. “Tomorrow is about being ready again after a one-week break. It’s not about youngsters’ playing time tomorrow. With all respect, I like the guys but they play today with the academy and they need to make sure their team wins this game. The professional squad will take care of the game tomorrow.” Tuchel revealed he had a say in Chelsea rejecting Huddersfield’s loan offer for Vale. The 18-year-old midfielder is in talks with the club over extending his deal, which runs out in June 2023. Tuchel added that he is relaxed about Chelsea’s inactivity during the transfer window. The German said there were no talks with Barcelona’s Ousmane Dembele, who is out of contract in the summer. Chelsea travel to Abu Dhabi for the Club World Cup after facing Plymouth. Tuchel reported that Reece James will stay in London to continue his rehabilitation on a torn hamstring. Galatasaray are interested in signing the midfielder Ross Barkley, whose opportunities have been limited under Tuchel, on loan.
