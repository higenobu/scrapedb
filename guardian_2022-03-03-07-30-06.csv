3/3/2022,"Liverpool’s pursuit of what Jürgen Klopp insists is an unlikely quadruple goes on, though progress into the FA Cup quarter-finals was more complicated than it should have been. The Carabao Cup winners were comfortably in the ascendency against Norwich courtesy of a Takumi Minamino double until Lukas Rupp’s goal brought anxiety to Anfield. Liverpool saw victory out, however, to record an 11th successive win for the first time in 15 years. Jordan Henderson was the only member of Sunday’s starting line-up to retain his place as Klopp made 10 changes for the fifth round tie. James Milner made his 50th appearance in the FA Cup, with the 36-year-old’s inclusion at right-back underlining his value to Liverpool yet again. Smith also rang the changes, seven from Friday’s defeat at Southampton, and understandably bemoaned a fixture schedule that placed an onerous burden on Norwich fans for the fourth meeting of the season between the teams. “It is too late for the away fans to travel and to be expected to travel back,” said the Norwich manager, although roughly 1,000 Norwich supporters did journey to Merseyside for an 8.15pm kick-off. The sheer magic of it all. The away fans witnessed a committed performance laced with an occasional threat from their makeshift team, but mainly the dominance and goal threat that Liverpool exert whenever they meet. Milner was prominent on the right flank, assuming the elder Trent Alexander-Arnold role with several dangerous crosses and readiness to join the attack, and Curtis Jones went close to reprising his FA Cup winning goal against Everton from two years ago with a curled effort from the corner of the visitors’ area. The midfielder’s shot sailed beyond Tim Krul only to kiss the top of his crossbar. Teemu Pukki had Norwich’s best opening of the first half after a sharp turn and run at the Liverpool defence by Przemyslaw Placheta. Milner cut out his attempt to send Milot Rashica through on goal but the ball broke to Pukki who, from a tight angle, dragged a shot wide of Alisson and the far post. Norwich had defended with discipline and organisation but were undone when Liverpool switched play swiftly from right to left through Henderson and Jones. Kostas Tsimikas chipped a cross into a crowded penalty area where Diogo Jota dummied for Divock Origi, who showed neat control and the awareness to pick out the unmarked Minamino. The Japan international could not and did not miss, beating Krul with a powerful close-range finish. It was the 750th goal of Klopp’s 360-game Liverpool reign. Minamino claimed his and Liverpool’s second when Klopp’s masters of the set piece struck again, albeit with the aid of Ben Gibson. The Norwich captain got his head to a corner from Tsimikas but succeeded only in glancing it on to the Liverpool forward. Minamino, again unmarked at the back post, had time to take the ball down before beating Krul with a shot that swerved from the outside of his right boot and in off the inside of the near post. The Liverpool goalscorer was an unused substitute at Wembley but his contribution to both domestic cup runs this season has been impressive. Minamino scored four goals in Liverpool’s victorious Carabao Cup campaign, including the vital stoppage time equaliser against Leicester in the quarter-final, and also scored in the FA Cup fourth round win over Cardiff. He may get a second bite at Wembley on Liverpool’s current form. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain almost maintained Liverpool’s record of scoring three in every game against Norwich this season when, having wriggled his way into space outside the area, his low shot cannoned off the foot of a post. Klopp had replaced Jones with Harvey Elliott at the interval due to the midfielder suffering a reported thigh injury. Smith was also forced into a substitution when Placheta fell awkwardly over the advertising hoardings at the end of the first half after a tussle with Tsimikas. The winger received lengthy treatment during the interval before eventually limping away. His replacement, Josh Sargent, had an excellent chance to inject hope into Norwich’s night but, diving to meet a deep cross from Dimitris Giannoulis, the USA international headed wide. The second half was a pedestrian affair with both teams appearing to declare at 2-0 when Lukas Rupp suddenly threw a lifeline to the visitors. Sargent’s run and pass through central midfield created the opening and, with Joe Gomez backing off, the Norwich midfielder swept a finish past Alisson from 20 yards. Substitute Jonathan Rowe was close to equalising with five minutes remaining when he broke away from Milner only for Alisson to tip away his rising drive towards the top corner.",Sport/Football,Minamino double sends Liverpool past battling Norwich and into last eight,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/02/liverpool-norwich-fa-cup-fifth-round-match-report
3/3/2022,"West Ham will have to make do with competing on just the two fronts for the remainder of this season after Southampton advanced to the FA Cup quarter-finals at their expense. A trip to Seville in the Europa League next week and their tilt for a top-four berth in the Premier League will no doubt soften the disappointment of defeat here but there will be a lingering frustration for David Moyes given how his side allowed a game in their grasp to get away from them. Romain Perraud rocked West Ham with a phenomenal, rasping strike from outside the box – it was some way to his open his account for the club – before the former Southampton loanee Michail Antonio levelled in the second half. But James Ward-Prowse restored the hosts’ advantage with a no-nonsense penalty before the substitute Armando Broja secured passage into the next round, wriggling clear of three defenders before slotting home into the far corner. It was a minor miracle that Southampton were not trailing when Perraud rifled a shot into the top corner beyond the West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, one of two changes made by David Moyes. His opposite number, Ralph Hasenhüttl, elected to make sweeping changes, the captain Ward-Prowse and Kyle Walker-Peters the only players to keep their place from Friday’s comfortable victory over Norwich. Southampton, perhaps unsurprisingly then, looked awkward and were haphazard until Walker-Peters shifted the ball from right to left on 31 minutes. Perraud took one touch to move the ball out of his feet before dispatching a left-footed effort that flew in from 25 yards, whistling diagonally across Areola. Hasenhüttl could not hide his delight, running on to the pitch in celebration, and the Southampton substitutes stood to applaud. Two of those on the bench, Stuart Armstrong and Armando Broja, arrived for the second half. They could have doubled their advantage before the break but Adam Armstrong played a hospital pass to Will Smallbone, who tentatively joined the attack to the striker’s right. In the away technical area Moyes, arms folded, could be forgiven for wondering how his team were behind. Pablo Fornals, again operating from left wing-back, telegraphed a fine pass over the top of the Southampton back line to give Jarrod Bowen a sight of goal within the opening 67 seconds but the defender Jack Stephens nicked the ball away to prevent the forward a shot at goal. Fornals was causing problems, slipping in Antonio only for Stephens to get again avert the danger after Yan Valery was lured into tracking Manuel Lanzini who rushed towards the ball. Ben Johnson roamed forward from right-back and rattled a shot against the side netting after going close following more good work by Fornals. The West Ham wing-back cut inside Perraud but Moussa Djenepo, who endured a difficult first half, got back in time to poke the ball out for a corner. Djenepo was replaced at the interval, along with Shane Long, who was grounded with a back injury. But West Ham’s best first-half opening came when the powerful Michail Antonio, who won the Football League Trophy with Southampton in 2010, stood up a cross from the left, after Soucek and Fornals combined. Bowen rose in the six-yard box but could not direct his header on target. Soucek was forced off early in the second half after taking a stray elbow to the head from Ibrahima Diallo. West Ham did not allow the break in play to disrupt them and they replied when Willy Caballero made a mess of a Bowen corner. The ball flew towards Kurt Zouma at the near post and Caballero failed to gather, allowing Issa Diop to pick up the pieces and hook the ball towards Antonio, who prodded in from close range to spark delirium among the almost 5,000-strong travelling support in the Northam Stand. But five minutes later West Ham were at the mercy of the video assistant referee, Simon Hooper, who advised the referee, Andre Marriner, to take a closer look at how Craig Dawson had prevented Broja from getting a clean shot at goal. Broja raced on to Stephens’ quick free-kick and Dawson was adjudged, after Marriner went to the VAR monitor, to have fouled the striker. Ward-Prowse slammed the subsequent penalty down the middle to give Southampton, semi-finalists last season, a whiff of another run deep in the competition before Broja sealed victory in stoppage time.",Sport/Football,Southampton’s Armando Broja ensures FA Cup fifth-round win over West Ham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/02/southampton-west-ham-fa-cup-fifth-round-match-report
3/3/2022,"It felt as if the crisis that has enveloped Chelsea was about to take on yet more collateral damage. The Luton striker, Harry Cornick, had raced through to put his team back in front just before half-time and Kenilworth Road was rocking. The Championship promotion chasers scented an FA Cup upset. It is impossible to follow Chelsea at the moment, during this week of all weeks, without being distracted by the broader, more serious picture. In other words, the unravelling of Roman Abramovich’s ownership amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. There have been calls in parliament for the oligarch to be sanctioned, a move by him to try to hand over stewardship of Chelsea to their charitable foundation and, on the verge of kick-off here, confirmation that he intends to sell the club. In football terms, Chelsea were reeling from Sunday’s Carabao Cup final penalty shootout loss to Liverpool, albeit after a decent performance, and now they were staring at an upset against Luton. They were able to gather themselves in the second half, relief chief among the emotions for Thomas Tuchel, not least as it was the manager’s two struggling strikers who turned the tie around. After a tactical tweak to 3-5-2 that put them alongside each other up front, Timo Werner scored the equaliser with a fine touch and finish. And he then crossed low from the right for Romelu Lukaku to slide home the winner. Despite Luton’s fight, particularly in the first half, Chelsea had too much. It was at a little after 6pm that Abramovich had released his statement about the intended sale. He will not seek to call in his £1.5bn loans and the net proceeds from the change of ownership, he said, would be donated to a charitable fund that will benefit the victims of the war in Ukraine. Abramovich’s name would be chorused at various points by the Chelsea fans. “You are embarrassing,” retorted the home crowd. The story is moving fast and, as at Wembley on Sunday, it cast an inescapable shadow over the game. What is the point of anything, including football, when war is tearing a country apart? Amid the existential questions, Tuchel’s task was to guide Chelsea into a sixth FA Cup quarter-final in seven seasons and, as he made sweeping changes to his Carabao Cup final line-up, it was significant that his opposite number, Nathan Jones, did something similar. For the Luton manager, the Championship games at Middlesbrough and Coventry on Saturday and Tuesday respectively are crucial. Luton started with a ferocious intensity – the players feeding off the crowd and vice versa – and they were in front inside two minutes when Reece Burke got to a Luke Berry corner in front of Malang Sarr to send a looping header into the far corner. It felt as if Chelsea were still trying to understand who was who and where. Tuchel had started with Ruben Loftus-Cheek in the middle of the back three while there was a first Chelsea start for Kenedy since January 2018. Tuchel’s team stabilised. They had started to creep forward, Saúl sending a header straight at Harry Isted. What a night it was for the substitute goalkeeper. He had come on for Jed Steer, who turned his ankle in gruesome fashion, for only his third Luton appearance. The other two were in the Football League Trophy. When Saúl swept home the equaliser – his first goal for Chelsea – after good work by the non-stop Mason Mount and a break of the ball off Werner, Chelsea reached for the jugular. They created a clutch of chances, the best of them being a one-on-one for Saúl, which Isted saved. There was a Kenedy rocket that the goalkeeper tipped over; a shot from Lukaku that drew a good save and the moment when Isted misjudged a long Antonio Rüdiger ball and got away with it. Luton could feel that Chelsea were vulnerable. Dan Potts had wasted a headed opportunity after rising high on 26 minutes while his team caused problems with their direct running. They turned the tie back upside down when Admiral Muskwe released Cornick behind a high Chelsea defensive line. The striker’s finish was marked by icy composure. He was clearly onside despite Chelsea’s protests, Sarr having been late stepping out. Tuchel needed more from so many players. It had been grim pickings for Lukaku and Werner up until the midway point of the second half but everything changed quickly after the manager’s tactical tweak. Werner had looked uncertain, his touch heavy. He had given the ball away an awful lot. But it came together for him when Loftus-Cheek, who excelled with the ball at this feet, especially when driving forward, played a long pass up the inside left channel. This time, Werner’s control was excellent and the finish, body opened up for the sidefoot, was true. Moments later, Werner turned provider and Lukaku was the grateful beneficiary. Luton had nothing left.",Sport/Football,Lukaku caps Chelsea comeback after Luton threaten to deepen turmoil,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/02/luton-chelsea-fa-cup-fifth-round-match-report
3/3/2022,"Arsenal moved five points clear of the WSL title holders, Chelsea, with a dominant 4-0 defeat of Reading. If Arsenal were feeling any pressure with Chelsea breathing down their necks, two points behind them and with a game in hand prior to kick-off, then it did not show at rain-lashed Borehamwood. Reading could have been a banana skin on their title charge. The Royals sit in sixth having lost their last two games in all competitions but prior to that they were unbeaten in 10 league matches, finding some of the consistency that has eluded manager, Kelly Chambers, in recent campaigns. Before this fixture Jonas Eidevall had praised their impressive season to date. “Apart from their last two games, Reading have been in amazing form, they have had amazing results,” the Arsenal coach said. Before kick-off there was a pause as the captains, Kim Little of Arsenal and Reading’s Natasha Dowie, held up a Ukraine flag in a show of solidarity with the invaded country, while Arsenal wore strips of blue and yellow tape side by side to form the flag on their wrists. It took 22 minutes for a partnership between the Arsenal forwards Stina Blackstenius and Vivianne Miedema, with the latter playing deeper, to bear fruit. Miedema passed back to Blackstenius inside the box and the interception of the Swede’s return ball fell kindly for Miedema who fired into the far corner past Rhiannon Stewart. Two minutes later the Gunners doubled their lead. Caitlin Foord found Blackstenius and the striker’s shot was cleared off the line only for Katie McCabe to fire in the follow up. The third goal came 10 minutes later when Steph Catley’s corner was powered in by the head of Leah Williamson. In the second half Miedema and Blackstenius would combine again for the fourth, with the former racing through on the right before squaring to her strike partner who fired in to seal the win. With a close to fully fit squad, that was boosted in the January transfer window, Arsenal have started to find the rhythm that gave them a blistering start to the season. They have to win every game and hope Chelsea, who now have two games in hand, drop points if they are to reclaim the title they last won in 2019. The pressure is now on Emma Hayes’s side though, to close that gap and edge ahead of the team that have led from the front all season.",Sport/Football,Arsenal extend lead at top of WSL after first-half flurry sinks Reading,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/02/arsenal-reading-wsl-match-report
