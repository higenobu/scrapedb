2/15/2022,"Eddie Jones is hopeful of unleashing Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes against Wales when England’s Six Nations campaign resumes on Saturday week with the head coach optimistic of welcoming back a number of senior players from injury. Tuilagi continued his comeback on Saturday for Sale and was among their try-scorers against Worcester on his first start since a hamstring injury. Jones was due to speak to the 30-year-old centre as well as the Sale director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, on Tuesday before finalising a training squad for the first fallow week of the competition but he acknowledged Tuilagi would be a significant addition as his side seek to make up for last year’s 40-24 defeat in Cardiff.  Lawes has been sidelined with a head injury suffered in mid-January as he progresses through the return to play protocols. He has been restricted to running and weight training but Jones is hopeful he will be back in full contact training by the end of the week. Lawes led England with distinction against Tonga and South Africa in the autumn in the absence of Owen Farrell and though Tom Curry fulfilled the role against Scotland and Italy, the expectation is that the Northampton forward would resume the captaincy. Joe Launchbury, who was briefly called into camp last week after two matches for Wasps after a lengthy layoff with a knee injury, is set to come into contention to face Wales, along with Lewis Ludlam, who started against Scotland but suffered a rib injury which ruled him out of Sunday’s 33-0 win over Italy. Asked which players Jones hoped to have available again, Jones said: “Potentially Launchbury, Tuilagi, Lawes, Ludlam, I’ll have a chat to Alex and Manu and see where they’re at and whether he’s got enough petrol in the tank to make the step up. We’ll assess it from there. Just having a power-running centre would give us a different option. “Everything we’re doing now is about trying to create opportunities through finesse and that’s through good running lines and passing. But to have someone who can take you forward quickly and engage two or three defenders then allows you try and finesse in extra space, which would be really useful to us. “We’d be hopeful that by the end of [the] week [Courtney] will be training fully. He’s making some great progress and the medical staff have done some terrific work with him. He’s not far away now and we’re really hopeful he’ll be back in full training and able to play against Wales.” Last year against Wales, England felt wronged after a controversial Josh Adams try came from a quickly taken penalty by Dan Biggar and a Liam Williams score that featured a questionable knock-on decision in the buildup. Jones said: “I don’t even remember that game. To me, that game was a Rassie Erasmus video game because we got two difficult decisions against us early that were apologised for by World Rugby for being incorrect, but that doesn’t get you a result back. I don’t think there is anything to learn from bad refereeing.” Wales got their campaign back on track with a hard-fought win over Scotland, having been resoundingly beaten by Ireland. “They were outstanding [against Scotland]. They hung in the game,” said Jones. “It was a game they shouldn’t have won. It was a great attritional performance. They’re Six Nations champions aren’t they? They’re not going to throw away their mantle easily. Biggar at 10 is obviously enjoying the captaincy. He’s got a bit of theatre about him, which is good for the game.” Meanwhile, Ellis Genge has revealed how he came to the rescue of Italy’s Sebastian Negri after the Zimbabwe-born forward appeared to have been knocked unconscious in a collision with England’s Nick Isiekwe. Genge spotted what had happened to Negri, alerted the medics and put him into the recovery position. Negri has since tweeted his gratitude to Genge for his quick-thinking. “I heard him choking so I gave him a slap to see if he reacted,” said Genge. “He just carried on choking so I didn’t know if he had swallowed his tongue – that’s why I tried to roll him on to his side. I’m not a master in medicine but I’m pretty sure you are supposed to put them in the recovery position so I tried to do that. I was quickly ushered away by the medics so I let them just carry on. “It’s horrible when that happens. When you are on the pitch you think rugby is the be-all and end-all but you are definitely brought back down to earth quickly and realise reality when something like that happens.” After the defeat in Cardiff last year, Genge said that he had received death threats online after footage emerged of him standing motionless rather than clapping Wales back into the dressing room. Addressing England’s next match, Genge said: “There is history there and Wales and England are very patriotic people. You’d be disappointed in a Test match if somewhere in there, there wasn’t a bit of niggle.”",Sport/Sport,Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes could add ‘finesse’ for England against Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/14/manu-tuilagi-and-courtney-lawes-could-add-finesse-for-england-rugby-against-wales
2/15/2022,"Berlin juries have an interest in the confrontational and the transgressive: my guess is that this film in competition from Canadian director Denis Côté may well win the big prize. I am still not entirely sure how to view its exploitative aesthetic. But it’s undoubtedly true that the characters and performances grow and develop, unexpectedly, into something poignant and even rather melancholy by the end. The setting is a therapeutic summer residency in a country house near a lake for young women who have issues with hypersexuality and sex addiction. They must surrender their phones (except for certain permitted breaks) and live together as a group with their mentors, with one weekend pass for the entire time; there are also activities and discussion groups. Geisha (Aude Mathieu) is a sex worker with piercings and a shaved head, and an aggressively slouching, jeering attitude; Léonie (Larissa Corriveau) was abused by her father as a child and now wishes to be humiliated and abused during group sex, often with strangers. Eugénie (Laure Giappiconi) has similar attitudes, together with drug abuse. The group is being guided by the cool, mature detached Sami (Samir Guesmi), whom Geisha naturally tries to seduce – claiming that she’s offering him a freebie, despite getting €300 a time in the sex marketplace – and to provoke him with racist remarks. Sami’s colleague is the German Octavia (Anne Ratte-Polle), who has a troubled personal life and a tense, competitive professional relationship with the founder of this course: this is pregnant Mathilde (Marie-Claude Guérin) who is ceding responsibility to Octavia and taking this summer off for maternity leave.  Scene by scene, Côté lays out the women’s memories, their violence, their intensity, their stamina, their need to shock, or their need to show they don’t care. But inevitably, a thaw sets in which we duly notice when the three women get away from the house for their weekend break. Geisha plaintively asks her boyfriend if their sex needs to be quite so porno and rough. Eugénie offers free sex to a trucker and ends up almost simply asking to be hugged. And in the film’s keynote scene of transgression, Léonie submits to some serious BDSM with her partner and then afterwards asks her man if she might possibly sleep with him in his bed and not just on the sofa. Of course, we are waiting for the ultimate contamination: sex between one or more of the girls and the adults running the group. Côté keeps us hanging on for that one, but Octavia is unexpectedly moved by Eugénie’s talent for drawing – and by Eugénie herself – a revelation which might have been rather absurd, but which Côté manages with forthright conviction. Finally, there is a rather touching final-night “party” scene and an even more wistful sequence when the girls, like innocent little kids at the summer camp, run gleefully to jump in the lake. The housekeeper, taking a motherly concern, asks Geisha if she might consider not minding quite so much about how boys look at her. It’s a question that might usefully be turned towards the film-maker himself. The three woman themselves and their sexuality are arguably glamorised, and male-gazed, for all that the movie is ostensibly about their own recovery from dysfunction and abuse. Well, the performances from Mathieu, Corriveau and Giappiconi are all very good and the movie is, against the odds, rather affecting.
