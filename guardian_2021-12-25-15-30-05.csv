12/25/2021,"The first weekend away. An auspicious landmark in any relationship, but especially with the new boyfriend still living at home with his parents and me 200 miles away in thin-walled student digs with seven sharp-eared housemates. Such was the allure of privacy, I didn’t ask any questions. “My mate’s got a place in north Wales we can have for the weekend,” he said. “No one will bother us.” I thought it sweet and funny to call him Danno, and told him to book it. It was February 1988. Our relationship was just days old. In the sharp slant of a winter setting sun, we headed off in my Mini, him (6ft 3in) in concertina folds. We were too young, too hooked up on the promise of adventure and what I will euphemistically call romance to bother with boring old weather forecasts.  The “place in north Wales” was on the outskirts of Pwllheli on the gorgeous Llŷn peninsula, wild beyond belief if you’d grown up in Catford, south London, as we both had. It was also the sort of accommodation Alastair Sawday, he of those Special Places guides, had missed: this one was more of the Withnail and I Special Places variety. A decrepit, squalid, mouldering caravan, it was unencumbered with snazzy luxuries such as heat, lighting or a chemical toilet, but complete with a neighbouring rotting steel barn that creaked all night as it swayed in the gales. Then it started snowing. It went from flurry to blizzard in seconds as we carried our bags of entirely inappropriate clothes from the car. It was snowing diagonally, upwards, sideways, into my eyes, ears and mouth. I bitterly regretted packing a LBD and heels instead of thermals, fleeces, hot-water bottles, Ready Brek (I still believed adverts at this point) and knee-high mountaineering socks. This was, of course, years before torches on phones: using the new boyfriend’s lighter, we rummaged through cupboards, disturbing very cold Welsh spiders but falling with glee upon one woolly hat (I put my feet in that), an oddly elegant tall pink candle, two half-used tealights, a jigsaw puzzle and about 1,000 protein bars. Apparently the mate had invested heavily in these, way ahead of anyone knowing quite what a protein bar was. I set the table with two of them where plates would normally go; we hadn’t brought any food with us, thinking we’d go out to a pub for dinner. By this point, in one of the more exposed positions on the Llŷn, we couldn’t see the car through the snow, let alone the road to town. I’d like to say that childlike excitement at the snow meant flirty snowball fights and making a snowman with a protein bar for a nose. It didn’t. The only time we went out was to pee. At one point, the door wedged shut under the weight of snow and I thought for a terrifying moment that we would have to go to the loo indoors in front of one another. We put on all the clothes we’d brought – in my case, this included a couple of racy bras on top of each other – climbed into bed with a protein bar and tackled the jigsaw by candlelight. It was of the Isle of Man, and only at the end did we realise three pieces were missing. We had just half of Douglas, and absolutely nothing in the way of romance. Early the following morning, a moment of true winter joy. The view from the caravan door at dawn, all patchwork fields blanketed in deep, crisp and even snow, remains a favourite memory, largely because we were checking out. We grabbed what we needed – including a couple of protein bars, just in case – left the car until the snow melted and booked into a local B&B. The lovely owner, whom I actually hugged despite my double-bra ensemble over a sweatshirt, insisted on cooking us a fry-up even though we hadn’t stayed the night before, and gave us a flask of tomato soup to take out for our walk. There were radiators, lights, a bathroom. There may even have been some winter romance during our stay there. And that relationship? Reader, I married him. Thirty-three years later, he is still banned from booking any holiday accommodation, whatever the season.

Terry Pratchett’s short story is animated in a half-hour adaptation, following Granny (Walters) and her grandson Albert (Hugh Dancy) as they rescue a 14ft furry creature. Not everyone in their town is happy about it – is a lesson in Christmas spirit in order? Hollie Richardson While we lay in a Quality Street-induced coma, Superworm and Butterfly were busy helping their friends all day – until the wicked Wizard Lizard comes along. Olivia Colman and Matt Smith lend their voices for some easy-going fun for the young ’uns. HR In times of royal upheaval the Queen has tended to rise above it. But this was the year she lost Prince Philip, her husband and royal consort of 73 years, so there may well be a more personal dimension to the address. Graeme Virtue The illustrator who has brought so many of our beloved characters to life gets the documentary he deserves. As he fills a 30ft-long canvas, fans such as actor Peter Capaldi and comedian Josie Long celebrate his legacy. HR It’s Christmas 1966 and there’s no room at the Nonnatus inn as 20 extra expectant mothers make sure the annual tearjerking staple is packed full of drama. Luckily, Mother Mildred (Miriam Margolyes) comes to help as the babies start popping out all over the place. Meanwhile, Lucille (Leonie Elliott) is preparing for her wedding, with a couple of hiccups. Hannah Verdier Following its first season run, here’s the festive special of the Darling Buds of May spin-off. An experimental nativity, a spate of burglaries blamed reflexively on the local ex-con, and the visit of Charley’s austere parents are the three threads tied in a neat bow by writer Simon Nye for a toasty, undemanding episode. Ideal turkey-stupor telly. Jack Seale Mary Poppins Returns, 3.10pm, BBC One Emily Blunt (pictured below) was perfectly cast in this sparkling 2018 sequel to the Julie Andrews classic. Her magical nanny reappears to supervise the children of her former charge, Michael (Ben Whishaw), now a widower with a cashflow problem. With a twinkle in her eye and a fine singing voice, Blunt doesn’t stray far from the original – and neither does the film, even featuring a hand-drawn animation/live-action scene. Lamplighter Lin-Manuel Miranda (who else?) is a slightly better cockney than Dick Van Dyke, and Marc Shaiman’s songs stand up well to their forebears.

Gemma Arterton shines as Catrin, a secretary from Wales who finds herself part of the film script team at the Ministry of Information in London during the second world war. As the group plan a propaganda fiction based on the Dunkirk evacuation, she proves her ability to head writer Tom (Sam Claflin). Bill Nighy, as is his wont, dominates most of his scenes as an ageing thespian involved in the shoot. SW Love Actually, 10.40pm, ITV After Four Weddings and Notting Hill, Richard Curtis decided to expand his romcom remit with this 2003 film, featuring at least eight variations on the theme. Its overlapping stories include the prime minister (Hugh Grant, naturally) and a No 10 staff member (Martine McCutcheon); widower Liam Neeson’s young son and a classmate; and Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as film body doubles. There’s adultery and unrequited love, too, to add tartness to a mostly sweet experience.

12/25/2021,"When you’re a kid, Christmas is about the presents. Now middle age has made me maudlin, it still is about the presents – but in a different way. It’s about people’s presence as much as the gifts they give. Cue the eye roll, sure. But I’m serious. Even if Christmas is stripped of religious significance for many Australians, our relationship with treasured gifts gives us away. If we get sentimental about our things, it’s because we treat them sacramentally – as bearers of the presence of another. So even the biggest agnostic may be kind of religious without realising it.  Each Christmas, for instance, I find myself haunted by the ghosts of presents past: by friends and family who over the years have given me, variously, a novelty Batman mug, a crocheted Anne of Green Gables doll, a now-tattered origami lantern and an unruly orchid with no two flowers facing the same direction. I’ll be honest: I didn’t exactly go gaga over these random gifts that now, inevitably, clutter my apartment. But even if they don’t “spark joy”, I can’t toss them. Every time I see these gifts, I think of the people who gave them to me. There’s a link here with the more “official” sacraments of Christian tradition, like the bread and wine of the Eucharist that represent, in some mysterious way, Jesus’s body and blood. Through religious rite, ordinary objects gesture beyond themselves to a different order of reality. But plenty of us are closet sacramentalists: people who may not identify with any faith who, nonetheless, have a sacramental approach to everyday life. The journalist Nadine von Cohen writes movingly about her kettle that leaks everywhere and turns off mid-boil. Yet she can’t part with it because it once belonged to her cherished mum. “When someone you love dies, everything they owned, everything they ever touched seems sacred,” she writes. “Whether or not you ever saw your loved one use or wear an item is inconsequential. It was theirs and so you vow to treasure it forever.” Everything they ever touched seems sacred. When material objects are invested with the presence of others, we find ourselves straying into spiritual territory rather quickly. The kettle isn’t just a kettle, but a talisman charged with love and grief. You drink your wrenching loss and wild hopes – of someday, somehow seeing her again – along with that tea. Not every time, of course – that would be creepy. But these everyday hauntings suggest that ordinary life is no less a sacred space than within the walls of a church. “We leave memories in everything we touch,” observes the novelist Sandra Newman. “If I pick up a pebble, I put it down haunted.” Not just stones, either. Souvenirs, heirlooms, homes, stories and, of course, gifts: each bears the trace of people and their imprint on the world. If that goes for everything within the world, perhaps it’s also true of the world itself. There isn’t much difference between the kettle-keepers and religious believers for whom all things bear a trace of the love of God. As Pope Francis writes in his papal letter on care for the Earth: “The entire material universe speaks of God’s love, his boundless affection for us. Soil, water, mountains: everything is, as it were, a caress of God.” According to this way of thinking, the whole world and every good thing in it is infinitely more than what it appears to be: it is also a relationship marked by divine love. . Everything that exists is, in the end, a gift. And gifts evoke gift-givers. Perhaps contrary to their reputation, the religious among us are following the logic: they believe that everywhere and in everything we are haunted by the God who made and gave us all things. (Admittedly, things get confused when believers dodge their responsibility to steward the Earth and its resources – but that’s a rant for another time.) But God does not remain an absent presence. At Christmas, Christians believe the giver behind all gifts shows up in the flesh: in the birth of Jesus Christ called Emmanuel, which means “God with us”. That’s the haunting and mysterious claim at the heart of Christmas.
