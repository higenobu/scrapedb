1/19/2022,"When Paco Gento arrived in 1953, he thought Real Madrid were too big for him but that was nowhere near as big as he would make them. He joined a club that had not won the league in two decades, since before the civil war; by the time he retired 18 years later, it was the biggest, most successful in the world and he had set a record still unmatched half a century later and likely never to be beaten. Nicknamed La Galerna, the Gale, after the wind that tore through the Cantabrian coast like he tore through defences, Gento died on Tuesday, aged 88. In a career spent almost entirely at Real Madrid he won 12 league titles and six European Cups. No footballer can match that; only two clubs have won more and one is the institution he helped transform, where he was the honorary president.  Gento might not even have been a Madrid player for long. At the end of his first season, the club’s president and patriarch Santiago Bernabéu was minded to transfer him to Osasuna. Raised in the village of Guarnizo, where his family tended to livestock and chicken and he played barefoot with “balls” made of paper or stuffed with feathers, where he listened to Atlético on the radio, Gento had signed for Madrid at 18. “Too young,” he later admitted. He had only played a handful of games for his nearest club Racing Santander, one of them while still underaged at 17, forcing them to forfeit the match and leaving him having to wait to restart his career. The contract to join Madrid was signed hidden away in a garage somewhere to avoid furious fans in Santander and for a while they were not much easier on him in Madrid. The club had seen something that supporters could not yet. “The whole thing was too big,” he said shortly after retiring. “Just their name, the atmosphere, my isolation, my reserved character, the shyness, the fans who had a go at me and rightly so, all meant I walked a bitter road. I lost sleep over the criticism. It made me think that they would transfer me to a team in the provinces.” Alfredo Di Stéfano, who had arrived the same summer, had other ideas, telling Bernabéu that Gento was “untouchable”. There was something there, he was sure. And so it proved. “The lad was an introvert, he came from a small town and he felt out of place,” Di Stéfano recalled. “In the second year he became the best left winger in the world.” Gento would cite a game against Barcelona, where his opponent Josep Seguer asked whether he was ever going to “get off your bike”, as the moment it really started, and then it never stopped. In 1954, Real Madrid won the league for the first time since 1933. The following season they won the inaugural European Cup, the first of five in a row and a run unrivalled by anyone. Gento was there for all of them and still there in 1966, a veteran now when a team made up only of Spaniards won it again. He also lost two finals. The third European Cup was the one he would remember most fondly, scoring an extra-time winner against Milan. The players were exhausted, Di Stéfano telling him: “It’s down to you.” That remark clearly had an impact on him which said something about a personality entirely without presumptuousness, about his profile, and yet also about his significance, the trust they had in him. “His speed was terrifying,” his teammate Ignacio Zoco said. “It was impossible to stop him and as fast as he went he could stop in a metre while the other guy keeps running, skidding past trying to put the brakes on. He’s out the game and Gento’s going the other way.” This was probably the greatest forward line of all, a team that had Di Stéfano, Puskas, Kopa, Didí, Rial, and Canario, yet Puskas wrote of how their “plan was simple: we knew in Gento we had the fastest thing on two legs”. He was too fast for everyone, which had included him at first — he would run out of pitch and Di Stéfano would plead with Héctor Rial not to release him too soon as the rest could not catch up. But the control came, driven by a quiet determination to improve, to emulate and learn without ever considering himself a star, to serve. He did that better than anyone, and the trophies came too of course. The club he thought too big became bigger than anyone else because of him. “Don’t worry sunshine, you’ll be as big as your teammates,” Bernabéu assured him once, and Paco Gento was.",Sport/Football,"Paco Gento, Real Madrid legend and six-time European Cup winner, dies aged 88",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/18/paco-gento-real-madrid-legend-and-six-time-european-cup-winner-dies-aged-88
1/19/2022,"Nato has invited Russia to a fresh series of talks to discuss European security and arms controls as the alliance scrambles to avoid a possible Russian attack on Ukraine. “The main task now is to prevent a military attack on Ukraine,” the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said after a meeting with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz.  “We are willing to listen to their concerns but we will not compromise on core principles. We must remain clear-eyed about the prospects of progress but … will make every effort to reach an agreement.” Stoltenberg’s offer of further wide-ranging talks with Moscow follows inconclusive meetings last week between the US and Russia, as well as a rare meeting of the Nato-Russia Council, where Russia tabled uncompromising demands about the future security architecture of Europe, including legally binding guarantees that neither Ukraine nor Moldova will be allowed into Nato. Moscow wants a pullback of Nato troops from close to the Russian border, and an end to some intermediate nuclear weapons in Europe. The fresh invitation to talks may be a last-ditch attempt to show to Vladimir Putin that dialogue will give him substantive progress on arms controls that he can sell to a domestic audience and that by comparison a military intervention represents an incalculable political risk for him. But Stoltenberg’s offer still seems to leave Nato and Russia far apart on the agenda for the talks. Standing alongside Stoltenberg, Scholz said: “We all want stable and constructive relations with Russia. We have no interest in permanent tensions.” He added there were difficult issues about how to sequence the issues in any talks with Russia. He also came under pressure to say whether he regarded the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany as a purely commercial contract. He implied the project would stop if there was an invasion by saying he stood by an agreement Germany signed with the US last year. The Stoltenberg offer came as the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, met her Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow. Baerbock said it was hard to see the buildup of Russian troops as anything but a threat to Ukraine and that her country was prepared to pay a high price to defend its values. Baerbock also called for an urgent return to dialogue on the future of Ukraine through the Normandy Format, the four-way dialogue between Germany, Russia, France and Ukraine. The vastly experienced Lavrov said he would welcome US involvement in the Normandy Format, claiming it was impossible at present to persuade Ukraine to examine the necessary issues, including the legal status of the Donbass, the separatist region within Ukraine. With the Russian military buildup continuing, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is due to fly to Ukraine on Wednesday, where he is expected to focus on the offers Ukraine can make to restore dialogue. Lavrov defended the right of Russia to move its troops within its borders and demanded the promised written answers from both Nato and the US to Russia’s call for a rewriting of European security architecture including legally binding guarantees that neither Ukraine or Moldova will be admitted to Nato. Baerbock said: “There will be no security in our joint European home if there are no rules everyone can rely on. “And we have no choice but to follow them, even if there is a high economic price,” she added, in a reference to possible sanctions discussed by western nations. Her visit was being watched for signs of how the new German government will treat Moscow after the era of mediation between the west and Russia associated with the former German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Baerbock defended Ukraine’s right to self determination, but disappointed Kyiv by saying Germany would not provide arms to Ukraine on the grounds that Germany did not provide arms for historical reasons in conflict zones. She instead offered to provide Ukraine help with developing its hydrogen technology. There were unconfirmed reports in the German press that Germany was lobbying the EU and the US to soften any economic sanctions against Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine and that the west had agreed not to try to detach Russia from the SWIFT global payments system – an extreme measure that might have unpredictable impact on the world banking system. The US has threatened “severe economic consequences” in the event of Russian military action. A British military plane carried anti-tank weapons to Ukraine on Monday night on a flight path that avoided German airspace, but both countries denied there had been any dispute over flyover permits. Scholz sidestepped a question on whether he supported the British decision to supply Ukraine with anti-tank weapons, saying German policy for many years is not to export lethal weapons. .",News/World news,Nato invites Russia for fresh talks on Europe amid Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/nato-invites-russia-for-fresh-talks-on-europe-amid-ukraine-crisis
1/19/2022,"A woman who may have seen Prince Andrew with Virginia Giuffre at a London nightclub 20 years ago is “willing” to provide testimony in Giuffre’s civil lawsuit against the royal, whom she accuses of sexual abuse, the witness’s lawyer said. “I am proud to represent Shukri Walker, who has bravely stepped forward as a witness and encourages others who may have information to do so as well,” the lawyer Lisa Bloom said in an email.  “She is willing to do the deposition Virginia Giuffre’s team is seeking.” Giuffre, now 38, maintains that at age 17 she was coerced into having sex with the prince, by his associates Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Andrew emphatically denies all allegations of misconduct. Epstein, a convicted sex offender and financier, was arrested in July 2019 on charges of sex trafficking girls as young as 14. He killed himself in a Manhattan jail a month later, while awaiting trial. In New York in December, Maxwell, now 60, was found guilty of sex trafficking and related counts, for bringing girls to Epstein for him to sexually abuse. Bloom’s statement to the Guardian followed a petition submitted by Giuffre’s lawyers on Friday, asking a Manhattan federal court judge, Lewis Kaplan, to officially request assistance from British authorities in obtaining testimony from Walker. Giuffre’s lawyers noted that Walker has said she saw the royal “with a young girl around the time that plaintiff contends Prince Andrew abused her in London after visiting Tramp Nightclub”. They added: “Because Prince Andrew has denied ever meeting plaintiff or being at Tramp Nightclub during the relevant time period, Ms Walker’s testimony is highly relevant.” Walker’s willingness to cooperate is not a surprise. Bloom, who has represented several Epstein victims, previously told the Guardian: “My client says she was there and she remembers the night clearly because she never saw a royal before or since. “She says Prince Andrew was happy, smiling and dancing, and Virginia did not look happy. My client was a trafficking victim herself and wants everyone to know that sex trafficking is real, ongoing and devastating.” Bloom has also said she has given “the FBI all the details of my client’s story for further investigation”. Giuffre’s lawyers also asked Kaplan to request British assistance in obtaining testimony from Robert Olney, a former equerry, or aide. In court filings, they said Olney has “relevant information about Prince Andrew’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein”. Olney’s name, the lawyers said, “appears in publicly available copies of Epstein’s phone book”. Giuffre’s lawyers said they want to ask Olney about “any communications with or regarding plaintiff” and about Andrew’s travel to New York City and “to or from any of Jeffrey Epstein’s homes”. The request for assistance came several days after Kaplan refused to dismiss Giuffre’s civil lawsuit against Andrew. The prince’s lawyers argued unsuccessfully that Giuffre’s 2015 settlement with Epstein protected him from her suit. The $500,000 settlement featured a section stating that “second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant [are protected from] all, and all manner of, action and actions … including state or federal, cause and causes of action”. Andrew, however, was not mentioned. The prince has suffered repercussions from Giuffre’s litigation and from intensifying scrutiny over his connections to Epstein and Maxwell. Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Thursday: “With the Queen’s approval and agreement, the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages have been returned to the Queen. The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.” Recent court filings in Giuffre’s now-settled lawsuit against Maxwell have shown that more information might soon be unsealed. In a 12 January filing, an attorney for Maxwell said she was withdrawing her opposition to the unsealing of names mentioned in Giuffre’s litigation, men currently referred to as “John Does”. “After careful review of the detailed objections submitted by Non-Party Does 17, 53, 54, 55, 73, 93 and 151, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell writes to inform the court that she does not wish to further address those objections,” Laura Menninger wrote. “Each of the listed Does has counsel who have ably asserted their own respective privacy rights. Ms Maxwell therefore leaves it to this court to conduct the appropriate review.”",News/UK news,Witness willing to testify she saw Prince Andrew with a ‘young girl’ at London nightclub,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/18/prince-andrew-shukri-walker-witness-testify-london-nightclub

York racecourse have decided to rename the Duke Of York Stakes, a prestigious race for sprinters run each year at its May meeting, in a bid to distance themselves from the embattled royal and the story will certainly make headlines in Wednesday’s edition.  The track’s head of marketing and sponsorship James Brennan told the daily turf bible: “The race has been with us in different guises, over different distances and at different times of the year, since 1895. “It was introduced in honour of the then Duke of York, who went on to become King George V, and I think most of the pubs that are wrestling with this question come from the same root. “We don’t want the name of the race to be a distraction from what is a good contest and we’re seeking to clarify the history and connection. The current favourite, though we need to go through the protocol of the European Pattern Committee, is something like the 1895 Duke Of York Stakes. “That clarifies that it is a long-established race and has a connection other than to Prince Andrew.” Newbury12.45 Speech Bubble1.15 Walking On Air1.50 Goa Lil2.25 Fine Casting3.00 Keep Wondering (nb)3.30 Voice Of Calm4.00 Clifton BridgePlumpton1.25 Young Butler2.00 Dream In The Park2.35 Cheque En Blanc3.10 Dynamite Kentucky3.40 En Coeur4.10 PoucourSouthwell4.35 The Tron5.05 Percy Willis (nap)5.35 Lucayan6.05 Dubai Elegance6.35 Okaidi7.05 Fact Or Fable7.35 Kind Review8.05 Ex Gratia  The current Duke of York is being sued by Giuffre, who is American, and has claimed that she was lured into the service of Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and convicted sex offender who died in custody in New York in 2019. Her lawyers claim Giuffre was “lent out” to Andrew for sex in Epstein’s New York home, his property in the US Virgin Islands and in London while she was a 17-year-old minor, meaning the prince is responsible for her “battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress”. Andrew has strenuously denied the allegations. The Duke Of York was actually appointed York’s initial patron in 2015, and at the time he officially opened the course’s new weighing room. Andrew gave up that role, along with a number of others in 2019, following his disastrous BBC Newsnight interview. York is not seeking to change the name of the May contest completely, not wishing to sow confusion in the minds of the sport’s followers. “Any new race title takes time to settle in and the whole reason we have [major race] titles is to allow everyone to track that highest echelon of the sport,” Brennan said.",Sport/Sport,Prince Andrew scandal results in track renaming the Duke of York Stakes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/18/prince-andrew-scandal-results-in-track-renaming-the-duke-of-york-stakes-horse-racing
1/19/2022,"The six-year-old schoolboy Rikki Neave was murdered 27 years ago by a boy aged 13 with a “grotesque interest” in child murder who lied for decades to cover up the killing, a court has heard. James Watson, 40, denies the murder of Neave, who went missing in November 1994 and whose body was found in woodland near Peterborough the following day.  Opening Watson’s trial at the Old Bailey, John Price QC told the jury that Rikki’s mother, Ruth Neave, was charged and acquitted of his murder in 1996 and it is submitted that the decision to charge her was “wrong”. It was in February 2020 that Watson, who had appeared as a witness in the original investigation, was charged with the murder after a DNA breakthrough established he had been in close physical contact with the clothing Neave was wearing when he was murdered, the court heard. “In late November 1994, James Watson was exhibiting a grotesque interest in the subject of child murder generally, including in things said to his own mother,” Price said. “Immediately after the killing, even amidst the widespread local interest, teachers of his noted in him a conspicuous preoccupation with the extensive reporting of the fate of Rikki Neave.” Describing the case as a “whodunnit”, Price told the jury Neave was reported missing by his mother at 6pm on 28 November 1994. At 12.05pm the next day, Rikki’s body was found by PC Malcolm Graham in a wooded area on the fringe of the housing estate in Peterborough where Rikki lived, five minutes from his home, the court heard. Price said: “He had been strangled. The body was naked. It was lying on the ground, flat on its back. It had been deliberately posed by the killer, in a star shape, with outstretched arms and his legs placed wide apart.” It was established that Rikki was murdered when still clothed, in what was “most likely a surprise attack” from behind, with the neckline of his own zipped-up jacket used “as an improvised ligature”, the court heard. A single white shirt button was found perched on a leaf, 18 inches from Rikki’s left hand, the jury was told. At 9.30am the next day, 30 November 1994, the missing clothing was found by a police constable in a wheelie bin on the pavement outside a house on Willougby Court on the border of the wood, 150 yards from where the body had been found, the court heard. Three small white buttons were missing from the shirt, Price said. In May 1995, Rikki’s mother was charged with murder of her son and offences of cruelty towards him and his sisters, the jury was told. She pleaded guilty to the charges of cruelty but has always denied having anything to do with her son’s murder, the court heard. She was unanimously acquitted of murder by a jury at Northampton crown court on 30 October 1996, Price said. A cold case review was opened in 2015 and using techniques not available in the mid-1990s, scientific examination was taken of adhesive tapings applied in 1994 to the outer layer of Rikki’s clothing, the court heard. The results revealed trace evidence of DNA of its wearer, Rikki, and of other people, including a definitive match with the DNA profile of Watson, who was 13 at the time and is now of no fixed abode, the jury was told. On the morning of the day Rikki was reported missing, Watson and the boy had been seen with each other, the jury was told. When police first came to see him, Watson admitted he had met Rikki on that day but made no mention of any physical contact, the court heard. The jury heard Watson told police Rikki was not someone he knew. “This was not true,” Price said. “He knew him well. It was one of many lies James Watson is alleged to have told others about events on the Monday he had met Rikki Neave and Rikki Neave had gone missing. He was still doing so, when questioned under caution by the police 22 years later, in April 2016.” Witnesses saw Watson and Rikki playing together on the morning of the boy’s disappearance, while others saw the pair walking away together in the direction of the wood where Rikki was found, the court heard. For the first time, in 2016 Watson introduced an element of innocent physical contact between him and Rikki in his account of what happened, the jury was told.

1/19/2022,"It is perhaps a testament to current UK politics that the survival of a prime minister could come down to a test of honesty between two famously slippery individuals. But while Dominic Cummings very clearly wants to bring down Boris Johnson, it does not necessarily mean he is making things up – at least not always. In an addendum to an earlier post on his Substack blog on Monday, Cummings argued that Johnson’s defence of his attendance at the “bring your own booze” party in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020 – he believed it was a work meeting – was a lie.  Martin Reynolds, the senior No 10 aide who sent the invitation, had been warned the event would break Covid rules, and it was inconceivable Johnson would not have known of the exchanges, Cummings wrote. “There are many other photos of parties after I left yet to appear,” Cummings ended, ominously. “I’ll say more when SG’s [Sue Gray’s] report is published.” In normal times, such allegations from a former chief aide would seem career-ending for a prime minister. But Team Johnson will know two things: that Cummings is not renowned as a reliable witness, and that he has a track record of promising evidence that never materialises. For most voters, if they have heard of Cummings at all, it will be for his own lockdown breaking antics in spring 2020, notably his much-mocked “eyesight test” excuse for a family day trip to Barnard Castle. Cummings did eventually concede he had not initially told the whole truth about his travels, arguing this had been because he had decamped with his wife and son from London to Durham for security reasons, something he had not been able to disclose at the time. Similarly, in a marathon, barnstorming performance before a Covid inquiry last May, Cummings promised MPs he would provide evidence to back up claims about misdeeds by the former health secretary Matt Hancock and others, but never did. As ever with Cummings, what he says and his reasons for saying it are often complex, rolled up in a nest of vested interests, ancient grudges and a showman’s instinct for feeding the public just enough to keep them interested. Many of Cummings’ utterances bring in mind the supposed comment of the 19th-century Austrian diplomat Klemens von Metternich when told about the death of his equally wily French counterpart Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand: “What did he mean by that?” To take one example, while Cummings has been unequivocal about the social nature of the 20 May gathering, he is equally adamant that a similar event in the No 10 garden five days earlier was a work meeting. The difference? Unlike on 20 May, Cummings attended the 15 May event – and was pictured there, sitting within arm’s reach of a wine bottle and cheeseboard. Similarly, in his latest blogpost Cummings took the time to reject the idea there was a party at No 10 on 27 November 2020, despite witnesses describing it. One reason could be because it is believed to have been a leaving event for Cleo Watson, a former aide to Cummings, to whom he is close. It is notable too the way Cummings appears to drip-feed information via tweets linked to his Substack blog, where most pieces are behind a £10-a-month paywall. But there is one thing that should worry Johnson: when it comes to information about Downing Street parties, Cummings’ claims have, thus far, tended to be some of his more credible. For example, the blogpost first setting out what he knew about the 20 May party was published on 7 January, three days before ITV obtained a copy of the crucial email from Reynolds inviting 100 or so Downing Street staff to “make the most of the lovely weather” with drink in the garden. Pretty much all of what Cummings set out on 7 January, in some detail, has been corroborated with other evidence, and from different sources. In his latest update, Cummings could not have been more clear: Johnson lied to parliament by saying he had never been aware of attending any rule-breaking parties, and this could be proved. As ever with this most elusive of narrators, only time will tell if he really means it.",News/Politics,Johnson v Cummings: two slippery men in a test of honesty ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/18/boris-johnson-v-dominic-cummings-victor-still-uncertain-in-test-of-honesty
1/19/2022,"Boris Johnson has claimed “nobody warned me it was against the rules” for a drinks party to be hosted in Downing Street during the first lockdown, but also refused to deny the possibility he could resign should he be censured by the inquiry into rule-breaking. The prime minister, speaking publicly for the first time in almost a week, said he “hoped people would understand the circumstances we were operating in” at No 10 during the first lockdown.  In the interview, Johnson confirmed he had been interviewed by the senior civil servant Sue Gray for her inquiry into lockdown parties. She is expected to report next week. The prime minister also confirmed he had apologised to the Queen after it was revealed staffers held a leaving party – including wheeling in a suitcase filled with alcoholic drinks – the day before Prince Philip’s funeral when the Queen was required by coronavirus restrictions to sit alone. On Monday, Johnson’s former senior aide Dominic Cummings accused the prime minister of lying when No 10 denied the prime minister had been warned against allowing a “bring your own booze” garden party during lockdown. After Cummings’ latest allegations, Johnson explicitly denied he had been warned not to hold the event. “I can’t believe we would have gone ahead with an event that people said was against the rules … nobody warned me it was against the rules, I am categorical about that – I would have remembered that,” he told Sky News. Asked if he would resign should Gray conclude that he had misled MPs about his knowledge, Johnson did not demur. He said: “We’ll have to see what she says. And I think that she should be given the space to get on and conclude her inquiry and I would urge everybody who has knowledge of this and … memories of this to tell her what they know.” Johnson admitted to parliament last week that he attended drinks in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020 but claimed he had not realised it was a social gathering. Cummings wrote a blogpost on Monday challenging that account. He said he told Martin Reynolds, a senior official, that the invitation broke the rules and claimed Reynolds replied: “So long as it’s socially distanced I think it’s OK, I’ll check with the PM if he’s happy for it to go ahead.” Cummings said in his blogpost: “Not only me but other eyewitnesses who discussed this at the time would swear under oath this is what happened.” Looking distressed, Johnson insisted repeatedly he had believed it to be a work event and had not been warned that he should cancel the gathering – but said he would have put an end to the drinks party in retrospect. “I can tell you categorically, categorically, that nobody told me, and nobody said that this was something that was against the rules, or was a breach of the Covid rules, or we were doing something that wasn’t a work event because, frankly, I don’t think, I can’t imagine why on earth it would have gone ahead or why it would have been allowed to go ahead,” he said. “My memory of this event, as I’ve said, is going out into the garden for about 25 minutes for what I implicitly thought was a work event and talking to staff, thanking staff, I can’t remember exactly how many – but for about 25 minutes I was there. I then went back to my office and continued my work. “If I had my time again, I would not have allowed things to develop in that way. And when I went out into that garden, yes, I should probably have told people, I should have looked around and said ‘well, we’ve got to go back indoors,’ or ‘this isn’t the right way to do things.’” When asked how he had apologised to Buckingham Palace over a separate event held for his departing communications chief, James Slack, now deputy editor of the Sun, Johnson took several deep breaths before saying: “I deeply and bitterly regret that that happened.I can only renew my apologies both to Her Majesty and to the country for misjudgments that were made, and for which I take full responsibility.” Johnson, who was asked repeatedly if he would resign, made clear that was a possible outcome after the report’s publication. “I repeat my apologies for any and all misjudgments that were made, for which I take full responsibility, but I think people do need to wait and see the conclusion of the report, and I will draw the necessary consequences and conclusions but then come back to the House,” he said.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson: nobody warned me No 10 party was against the rules,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/18/boris-johnson-nobody-warned-me-no-10-party-was-against-the-rules
1/19/2022,"Microsoft is to pay almost $70bn to buy Activision Blizzard, the publisher of mega franchises including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, in the biggest ever takeover in the tech and gaming sectors. Microsoft said that the $68.7bn (£50.6bn) all-cash deal – which dwarfs its previous biggest, the $26bn takeover of LinkedIn in 2016 – will “provide the building blocks for the metaverse”. It is the biggest deal in tech history, eclipsing the $67bn paid by Dell to buy the digital storage giant EMC in 2015.  The deal will see the Xbox maker become the world’s third-biggest gaming company by revenue behind China’s Tencent and Japan’s Sony, maker of PlayStation games consoles. “Gaming is the most dynamic and exciting category in entertainment across all platforms today and will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms,” said Satya Nadella, the chairman and chief executive of Microsoft. “We’re investing deeply in world-class content, community and the cloud to usher in a new era of gaming that puts players and creators first and make gaming safe, inclusive and accessible to all.” The deal comes after a tumultuous time for Activision Blizzard, which has 10,000 staff globally a market value of about $50bn and three $1bn gaming franchises, which has been affected by a string of allegations of sexual misconduct and discrimination involving senior executives. On Monday, the company said that it had fired more than three dozen employees and disciplined another 40 since July last year to address the allegations. Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision Blizzard, will remain running the gaming business, which when joined with Microsoft will see the overall company run 30 internal games development studios. Microsoft said that the company’s strength in the rapidly growing mobile gaming sector was an important attraction of the deal. Daniel Ives, a tech and media analyst at the US firm Wedbush, said that while a deal of such scale will naturally attract the attention of regulators, Microsoft will ultimately gain clearance as it is not under the same scrutiny and pressure as Silicon Valley rivals such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google. “We expect this deal to ultimately clear regulators,” said Ives, in a note to investors. “However, there will be some inherent speed bumps navigating both the Beltway and Brussels on a tech deal of this size.” Ives said that while Nadella has seen huge success driving Microsoft’s business-to-business offerings, such as the cloud division led by Azure and Office 365, this deal will help turbocharge its consumer strategy which has “been on a treadmill approach”. “Acquiring Activision will help jump start Microsoft’s broader gaming endeavours and ultimately its move into the metaverse with gaming the first monetisation piece of the metaverse in our opinion,” he said. “With Activision’s stock under heavy pressure over the last few months, Microsoft viewed this as the window of opportunity to acquire a unique asset that can propel its consumer strategy forward.” Gaming has been a pandemic winner as the lockdowns across the globe fuelled a boom in playing to alleviate boredom, which in turn has prompted a deal-making boom in the sector.
