2/2/2022,"“BBC Three gets going at 7pm.” I don’t know about you, but seeing those words back on the screen last night – as the channel returned to TV again after six years of being digital-only – provided waves of nostalgia. When I was a teenager, turning on BBC Three just before 7pm and seeing those words was a daily ritual. Snog Marry Avoid? Celebdaq? The time S Club 7 walked out of Liquid News as their PR interrupted Claudia Winkleman’s line of questioning? I was there. A good part of my youth was spent in front of BBC Three. But does it still work to watch it in the traditional way? After all, we are now in the age of streaming, when half the shows are already available to watch on iPlayer. Only one way to find out: watch the entire evening of their launch night programming.  Oh, and full disclosure: this article nearly didn’t happen because I couldn’t work out how to re-tune my television first. After a short skit involving Bimini Bon-Boulash as a continuity announcer (joking “are we on?”), the first show to appear on BBC Three is a show by BBC Radio 1, promoting the upcoming slate of programmes on BBC Three. This is next-level corporate synergy that would make W1A blush. The whole launch show is a pre-record, which sucks a bit of the energy out. Then again, the last television channel that had a launch show was GBTV, and that involved Andrew Neil sat in a poorly lit bunker with his face and voice out of sync. So being live doesn’t always give you on-screen energy. There are constant trailers. From Love in the Flesh, a show where people cop off in a hot location (Love Island, who is she?) to The Fast and the Farmer(ish), a tractor racing competition. If you’re wondering, I spoke to BBC Three’s boss the other day and they joked that they were taken by the name of the show before they had heard what it actually involves. At least, I think it was a joke. RIP 60 Seconds. BBC Three’s old bulletins were someone reading the headlines as if their lives depended on it, while a lit stick of dynamite on screen flashed from left to right. The new bulletin, tonight hosted by Levi Jouavel, is longer (180 seconds!) and thankfully more informative. No more news reports that were essentially: “Happy happy sad sad terrible tragedy sad hot celebrity bye!” A show I didn’t realise was a celebrity special until the words “CELEBRITY SPECIAL” were printed all over the screen, Eating With My Ex has been on iPlayer since 2017. But for those of you who haven’t seen it, it is just as awkward as you might imagine. Two exes go on a date to work out whether there’s still a spark, with the rest of the restaurant seemingly full of extras getting a free meal if they talk in the background really quietly. A few weird things stand out. One is that some of the first people to appear on BBC Three’s much-hyped launch night are two celebrities from Too Hot To Handle, a Netflix show. The second is that, according to this programme, Geordie Shore is still going, too. The third is that there is a genre of celebrity who solely go on other reality shows to talk about their relationships, which you can only make sense of if you had watched the other reality show first. Perhaps a sign that I am falling out of BBC Three’s target demographic, the only thing I could think of while each couple was at loggerheads was “your food is getting cold”. My flatmate and I watch Drag Race every Saturday. Over the course of the pandemic we have watched the US original, Canada’s Drag Race (two series), RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars (two series), Drag Race Holland, Drag Race Thailand, RuPaul’s Secret Celebrity Drag Race (terrible) and RuPaul’s Drag Race Down Under. Oh and three series of Drag Race UK. And, thanks to Drag Race US returning and Drag Race Vs the World debuting so close to each other, we’ve had three talent show challenges in just over three weeks. Being gay is exhausting. The best thing about the various Drag Race franchises now being on television, rather than on streaming, is that you can tweet about exits without being murdered. But to enjoy them properly, you have to watch live. You also have to watch with others, so, for this new series, which pits Drag Race contestants from across the globe against each other, I ended up having to watch online: swinging by my local neighbourhood gay bar to enjoy the collective agony of watching the iPlayer livestream collapse three times due to poor wifi. At one point a punter attempted to tether the bar’s projector to someone’s phone. “Good luck, and don’t fuck it up,” narrated the bar’s drag queen. Perhaps we should have tuned in on terrestrial. Back home to watch Celeste Dring and Freya Parker in this completely surreal and rather compelling sketch show. It opens with their faces superimposed on snails to a tune by Annie Lennox. It ends with a Lana Del Rey spoof song so accurate that, if it was released as a single, I probably wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. There’s also a sketch hotline. “If you don’t like our material … or us … or both, or you think we’re ugly and need to know – don’t tweet us. Don’t email us. And don’t DM us on Instagram. Call our hotline and tell us personally.” One to look out for. A key reason I think this BBC Three relaunch is going to work is the fact that you’ll end up watching documentaries you wouldn’t have got around to watching if it was just available as a rectangle on a website. This is one of them: a heartfelt and sensitive series by Cherry Valentine on the complexities of growing up as a queer person in the Traveller community, and the difference you feel when you’re in drag compared with when you’re not. Also by now I’ve realised that this is the longest time I have watched the same channel continuously since the Olympics (look, the horse dancing was engrossing). The first official BBC Three repeat (in fact, it’s repeats all night from here), but it’s Fleabag and I’m not the Daily Mail, so who cares? Worth staying up for Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s “massive arsehole” joke alone. Do I have to keep going? I don’t keep going.",Arts/Television & radio,‘The whole launch show is a pre-record’: we watched BBC Three’s return to TV – so you didn’t have to,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/02/the-whole-launch-show-is-a-pre-record-we-watched-bbc-threes-return-to-tv-so-you-didnt-have-to
2/2/2022,"The FBI has confirmed that it obtained NSO Group’s powerful Pegasus spyware, suggesting that it bought access to the controversial Israeli surveillance tool to “stay abreast of emerging technologies and tradecraft”. In a statement released to the Guardian, the bureau said it had procured a “limited licence” to access Pegasus for “product testing and evaluation only” and suggested that its evaluation of the tool partly related to security concerns if the spyware fell into the “wrong hands”.  The bureau also claimed it had never used Pegasus in support of any FBI investigation. “There was no operational use in support of any investigation, the FBI procured a limited licence for product testing and evaluation only,” the statement said. The statement marked a direct acknowledgement by the FBI that it acquired Pegasus, one of the world’s most sophisticated hacking tools. The FBI’s procurement of Pegasus, which occurred in 2019, under the Trump administration, was first reported by the New York Times. It was a stunning revelation in part because the Biden administration has recently placed NSO on a commerce department blacklist, saying it had evidence that the company’s hacking tools had enabled governments around the world to conduct “transnational repression”, targeting dissidents and journalists. The Guardian and other media organisations have also reported multiple cases in which, security researchers say, governments have used NSO’s tools to target American citizens around the world, including Carine Kanimba, the daughter of the jailed Rwandan dissident Paul Rusesabagina, and Lama Fakih, a senior staff member of Human Rights Watch in Beirut. Once deployed, the user of Pegasus spyware can take complete control of a person’s phone, accessing messages, intercepting phone calls and using the phone as a remote listening device. A person with close knowledge of the deal, who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity, claimed that the 2019 acquisition of the Pegasus licence had occurred after a “long process” of negotiations between US officials and NSO. It is claimed one disagreement centred on how much control NSO would retain over its own hacking software. The source claimed that NSO usually kept sensors on its technology so that the company could be alerted in Israel if the technology was moved by a government client. But, the source claimed, the FBI did not want the technology to be fitted with sensors that would have allowed NSO to track its physical location. The source also claimed that the FBI did not want NSO’s own engineers to install the technology and did not want to integrate the spyware into its own systems. Ultimately, it is understood that NSO and the FBI agreed to keep the technology in a large container. NSO did not respond to a request for comment on these claims. The FBI was also concerned about possible “leakage” of any data to another foreign intelligence service, the source said. The source claimed the Pegasus licence was acquired by the FBI using a financial “vehicle”, which was not easily identified as being linked to the bureau. The FBI did not respond to specific questions about its alleged concerns, the financial vehicle it used to procure the Pegasus licence, or other details. In the end, the source claimed, the FBI did not actually use Pegasus. “They weren’t using it at all. Like, not even switching it on. But they kept paying for it, and they wanted to renew. It was a one-year test project and it cost about $5m [£3.7m], and they renewed for another $4m,” the source claimed. “But they didn’t use it.” In an emailed statement in response to claims about the bureau’s acquisition of Pegasus, the FBI said: “The FBI works diligently to stay abreast of emerging technologies and tradecraft – not just to explore a potential legal use but also to combat crime and to protect both the American people and our civil liberties. That means we routinely identify, evaluate, and test technical solutions and problems for a variety of reasons, including possible operational and security concerns they might pose in the wrong hands. There was no operational use in support of any investigation, the FBI procured a limited licence for product testing and evaluation only.” NSO has categorically denied that its Pegasus spyware can be used against US mobile phones. Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon and chairman of the finance committee, and a staunch privacy advocate, said: “The public deserves far more transparency from the executive branch, including the FBI and justice department, about any US government relationships with NSO and other cyber-mercenaries. The public has a particular interest in whether the government believes the use of these tools against Americans is legal.” The New York Times reported that NSO brought a “version” of Pegasus to New Jersey in June 2019, after the FBI had reportedly been offered a “workaround” by NSO that allowed a product called Phantom to “hack any number in the United States”. Without naming sources, the New York Times reported that NSO conducted demonstrations of Phantom to the FBI, which the newspaper said resulted in an alleged “attack” against a US phone number. In a lawsuit it filed in 2019, WhatsApp accused NSO of sending malware to 1,400 of its users. The company has said that about 100 of the individuals who were targeted were members of civil society, including journalists and activists. NSO has said in legal filings that even if WhatsApp’s allegations were true, it was acting as a “foreign agent” when its spyware was deployed against WhatsApp users, because its software is used by foreign governments who are meant to use its spyware to fight crime. NSO has also said that it does not have information about how its clients use its spyware or who its clients target. WhatsApp has also alleged in court filings that a US phone number was targeted by Pegasus on 9 May 2019. Without providing evidence or sourcing, the New York Times reported that the alleged intrusion on a US number, as described in WhatsApp’s legal case, was in fact a demonstration of NSO’s technology to the FBI. The FBI declined to comment on the allegation. NSO did not respond to a request for comment. WhatsApp said: “In all circumstances, our priority is to defend our services from threats that would harm people’s ability to safely communicate with one another. We will continue our efforts to hold NSO accountable for their attacks against journalists, human rights activists, and government officials in violation of US law. The spyware industry must be prevented from undermining the privacy and security of people in the US and across the world.”",News/News,FBI confirms it obtained NSO’s Pegasus spyware,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/02/fbi-confirms-it-obtained-nsos-pegasus-spyware
2/2/2022,"On the same day as Tom Brady’s official retirement, it was another former New England Patriot who stopped the league in its tracks. Brian Flores, former defensive coordinator for the Patriots and now former head coach of the Miami Dolphins, had enough. Enough with the sham interviews for Black candidates after NFL owners had already privately anointed white coaches. Enough with the impossible-to-reach targets for Black head coaches on the rare occasion they are hired. Enough with a Rooney Rule that 20 years since its birth and despite its intentions to give more opportunities to minority candidates has left us with exactly one Black NFL head coach in the NFL in 2022.  Flores was fired in January after leading the Dolphins to an 8-1 record to close out the season and had compiled back-to-back winning campaigns in Miami, the first coach to do so since 2003. He should have been scooped up by another team five seconds after his ousting. But instead he sat and watched as candidates with no head coaching experience filled the vacancies at the Denver Broncos and New York Giants. Understandably, he couldn’t take it anymore. The 40-year-old filed an explosive class action complaint against the NFL and each of the league’s 32 franchises in federal court on Tuesday, alleging racial discrimination in their hiring practices of head coaches, coordinators, and general managers. Flores made a litany of disturbing allegations in the lawsuit, starting with the claim that Dolphins owner Stephen Ross offered him $100,000 for every loss in 2019 so the team could earn a higher draft pick. Miami instead finished with five wins, exceeding expectations. As the complaint details, there was no good option for Flores as a Black head coach. Had the Dolphins actually tanked, they would have been the league’s laughingstock and Flores would have been the easy sacrifice. Ignoring the request, which he did, made Ross “mad” and Flores was seen as “an angry Black man” who refused to comply with team policy, ushering in the end of his time in Miami. Here are the texts: pic.twitter.com/WjdLNRxfO1 Flores also shared a maddening text string from Bill Belichick congratulating him on the New York Giants head coaching job, which Belichick claimed was Flores’s. It turns out Belichick thought he was texting ex-Bills defensive coordinator Brian Daboll, who would be named the new Giants coach three days later. In the meantime, Flores went on another extensive interview with the Giants, who have not had a Black head coach in their nearly 100-year history, knowing the job was not his. Flores also alleges the Broncos used him to fulfill the Rooney Rule during their hiring cycle in 2019. According to Flores, then-general manager John Elway and team president Joe Ellis arrived at the interview an hour late and hungover. (The Giants, Dolphins and Broncos deny all the allegations leveled against them in the lawsuit and say they are committed to racial equality). This series of demoralizing events led Flores to do the unthinkable and set the NFL afire. “God has gifted me with a special talent to coach the game of football, but the need for change is bigger than my personal goals. In making the decision to file the class action complaint today, I understand that I may be risking coaching the game that I love and that has done so much for my family and me. My sincere hope is that by standing up against systemic racism in the NFL, others will join me to ensure that positive change is made for generations to come,” he said in a statement. Two hours after the Flores complaint dropped, the NFL released a statement of its own calling Flores’s claims, “without merit.” The league took months to investigate Deflategate. It took two hours to reach a decision on Flores’s accusations. Flores’ compelling 58-page lawsuit, which details the history of racism in the league, likens the NFL to a “plantation.” As the document says: “The owners watch the games from atop NFL stadiums in their luxury boxes, while their majority-Black workforce put their bodies on the line every Sunday, taking vicious hits and suffering debilitating injuries to their bodies and their brains while the NFL and its owners reap billions of dollars.” Then come the slew of examples, each one more devastating than the last. The NFL building its product on the backs of Black players only to ban them in 1934 once the league was financially viable. Colin Kaepernick’s ousting. The revelation that the league was trying to minimize payouts to former Black players involved in the $1bn concussion settlement through race-norming, a racist practice that claims Black people begin with a lower cognitive function than their white counterpoints. It’s hard to argue with the complaint’s depiction of the league as a quasi-plantation – of rich white men making money off the bodies of young Black men. Yet the cycle continues. Flores, a man of conviction, knows he is following in the footsteps of Kaepernick and risking his career by making public what has been so obvious. This is a pivotal moment for the league. Flores is not the only one with stories. Players across the league publicly expressed their support for Flores, along with their lack of surprise. The current President of the Unites States isn’t going to use Flores as a political pawn to attract racists. With Flores teeming with support, the spotlight turns to the owners. And it’s always been the owners. It’s not NFL commissioner Roger Goodell who, to his credit, has been vocal on the league’s lack of progress when it comes to minority candidates. It’s the collection of millionaire and billionaire team owners, who pay Goodell and decide who to hire. White men – and in all but two cases it’s white men – who are so rich that they know public opinion doesn’t affect them one way or another. After all, they’ve seen men of their class, race and wealth degrade the environment, damage the fabric of society, exploit college athletes and devalue democracy and still get away with it. They may not be representative of the NFL or the United States, but they control them. In a just world, Flores’s bravery would inspire change, like actual change, not just words painted in an end zone for show. If the Ross allegations are true, he would be ousted. The hiring and firing process would come with more accountability, as the complaint recommends. And while the first four head coaching hires this cycle have been white men, perhaps some of the remaining five slots will be filled by the droves of qualified Black candidates. But sadly, we shouldn’t hold our breathe because the system has proven time and time again that it’s as unjust as they come.",Sport/Sport,Brian Flores says the NFL is a plantation.

2/2/2022,"My brother, Michael McColgan, who has died aged 83, was a lifelong socialist and political activist. He gave up his career as a German university lecturer to retrain as a lawyer so that he could represent people fighting for justice, and was involved in the cases of the Orgreave miners in the 1980s and in the fight for truth and justice following the Hillsborough disaster. Mike was born in Islington, north London, the son of Lilian (nee Martin), a librarian, and Patrick McColgan, a local government officer – both leftwing activists. He grew up in Chingford, Essex, and attended the Monoux grammar school, Walthamstow (now Sir George Monoux college).  Mike studied languages at Reading University, graduating in 1961. Here he met Hope Hanlan, and they married in 1963. They later divorced but remained lifelong friends. In 1964 Michael started work as a lecturer in German literature at Sheffield University, where he translated George Lukacs’s Tactics and Ethics: Political Essays, 1919–1929 (1974). He settled in Pitsmoor, a deprived area of Sheffield, where he became active in campaigns highlighting police harassment of black youths. In the mid-1970s his political commitments increasingly drew him away from academia. The US civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements influenced Mike and he was drawn to solidarity work with struggles in Palestine and Northern Ireland. Around the same time, he met and fell in love with Olive Morris, a community activist in Brixton and member of the British Black Panthers. He became dedicated to anti-racist campaigning, believing that racism was largely driven by the state. Mike and Olive were devoted partners until Olive died of cancer in 1979. In the 1980s, Mike retrained as a solicitor and worked with Gareth Peirce in the defence of 95 miners charged with riot and unlawful assembly at the picket at Orgreave in 1984. The case against them was exposed as resting on fabricated evidence and collapsed. Mike continued to be active in the Orgreave Truth and Justice campaign to secure compensation for the miners and for the release of official records on the government’s role in the police’s tactics. Mike later contributed to the work that led to the families of the 97 football supporters killed in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster securing a fresh inquest verdict clearing the victims and Liverpool fans of responsibility for the deaths. He also worked for two solicitors’ firms in Sheffield, retiring in 2011, but continuing with his Hillsborough work with Birnberg Peirce. Mike also made numerous visits abroad reporting for human rights organisations on the treatment of prisoners in the US, France, India, Mauritania and Ethiopia. Gregarious and family-loving, Mike loved walking, cycling and touring the landscapes of Epping Forest, the Peak District and especially his father’s homeland, County Donegal. He organised several fundraising cycle rides for Liberty for which he was a director for two spells, 1996-98 and 2001-08. He is survived by his daughter, Rachel, from his first marriage, his granddaughter, Maddie, and his son, Owen, from his second marriage, to Pam Grindey, from whom he was separated.",News/Law,Michael McColgan obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/02/michael-mccolgan-obituary
2/2/2022,"‘They’ve taken your cells,” says a father to his son in a near-future dystopia where the latter has been cloned in an apparently unauthorised “batch”. So begins Caryl Churchill’s 2002 play, using the concept of cloning to explore identity, inheritance and what makes us uniquely ourselves, written at a time when ethical debates on Dolly the sheep raged. Like Polly Findlay’s 2020 revival at the Bridge theatre, it presents the story of a father (Lennie James) and three versions of his son (Paapa Essiedu) as a noirish thriller with shifting realities. Es Devlin’s set is a Scandi style living space soaked in blood-red light. There are stark bursts of white lighting, too, (designed by Tim Lutkin), flashing as if to blind us, while unnervingly quick costume changes by Essiedu really do create the illusion of more than one version of him.  But Lyndsey Turner’s production surpasses Findlay’s and turns this strange, elliptical play from a thought experiment into a flesh and blood tragedy of family reckoning, revenge and yearning for redemption, with drama as ancient and eternal, as it is futuristic. Much of this is down to the powerhouse duo of James and Essiedu. There is a realism and emotional honesty to their performances that creates alchemy and turns every last sentence – and stutter – into a meaningful matter between them. Despite the halting, somewhat gnomic dialogue, their characters come fully to life and the play’s subtler intentions are realised. Essiedu is astonishing to watch, performing love and blame with equal power. In his hands, this is the story of a son’s identity crisis. But James wrestles it back to make it one of toxic fatherhood, too. He is unassuming at first, smoothly evading culpability, then pleading and apologetic once he is cornered. Even when he reveals the violence of his past he, discomfortingly, retains our sympathies in his effort to start afresh – the clean slate of his new cloned son which gives him the chance to be a “good” father this time. Despite the darkness, James and Essiedu bring a surprising but genuine humour to their deliveries and sound as if they are in a Beckettian sitcom at times. They are simply scintillating to watch, effortless in their chemistry, syncopated in their dialogue, energising the action so it feels alive with anger, mystery and tragedy. This is a masterclass on how a revival can come blazing to new life in the right hands.

2/2/2022,"Police have said 27 people aged 15 to 44 have been charged with offences after widespread disorder in the Mayhill area of Swansea in the spring of 2021. The 27 are charged with the offence of riot and two of them are also accused of arson with intent to endanger life or being reckless as to whether a life of another would be endangered. They are due to appear in Swansea magistrates court between 2 and 4 March.  Cars were set on fire and bricks were hurled at houses, leaving people fearing for their lives. Ch Supt Trudi Meyrick, policing commander for Swansea and Neath Port Talbot, said: “Following a thorough investigation by local detectives, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) received files of evidence against these individuals. After detailed consideration by the CPS they have authorised the charges of riot and arson with intent to endanger life be brought. “The investigation team were resolute in their commitment to fully investigate the disorder that happened that night; residents of Mayhill were subjected to terrible scenes of disorder which caused serious harm and distress to the community. “The judicial process will now run its course and we await the outcome of that process. In the meantime our local neighbourhood policing team continues to work in partnership with agencies and the local community to tackle the issues that matter most to the residents of Mayhill and surrounding areas.” The chief crown prosecutor Jenny Hopkins added: “Criminal proceedings are active and that all the defendants have a right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.” An independent report published last week found that the police left residents “in danger, at risk and unprotected” for a “protracted period” during the disturbance. Jeremy Vaughan, the chief constable of South Wales police, apologised for his force failing to act quickly enough. The review highlighted that scores of officers were in the area but stood by. It also said that one officer in charge that night twice asked for extra police as backup but was refused. It highlighted one example of a vulnerable person whose life was thought to be in danger. Officers with shields were deployed but withdrew for their own safety, leaving the person and others like him “lost”, the report said. It concluded: “Significant failings are evident. Currently, available evidence strongly suggests failings in command structures and decisions, operational decisions and tactics, and communications.” ",News/UK news,27 charged with riot after Swansea disorder in spring 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/swansea-riot-27-charged-after-violence-in-spring-2021
2/2/2022,"Several of the participants in The Tinder Swindler (Netflix) describe the extraordinary events relayed in the documentary as like being in a film. One woman talks about being romanced by a man she met on the dating app. He called himself Simon Leviev. Their first date started at a five-star hotel and extended to a spontaneous trip on a private jet. Another woman (and there are many women), further down the line, says she feels as if she is in “a horror movie”. Given the show’s title, it isn’t too much of a giveaway to reveal that Leviev, who claimed to be the son of a billionaire diamond dealer, was not the wealthy, suave suitor he made himself out to be online, but a convicted conman named Shimon Hayut. Audiences love nothing more than a scam, from the podcast Sweet Bobby to the fascinating case of the “fake heiress” Anna Delvey. This slots neatly into the pantheon. It is a pacy, gripping feature-length film that lays everything out with precision and offers plenty of compassion for the victims.  We begin with Cecilie, a serial dater who describes herself as “a bit of a Tinder expert”. She becomes caught up in the whirlwind of Simon’s world. He sends her extravagant bouquets of roses, flies to visit her in Oslo and asks her to move in with him. Then, one night, he sends her photos and videos of himself and his bodyguard, bloodied, in trouble, under threat from enemies and suddenly unable to access the great reserve of finances he claims to possess. Then there is Pernilla, a Swedish woman who seems a little more worldly than Cecilie. “I’m just thinking: oh my God, another diamond guy,” she tells the director, drily, about matching with him. The director responds off-camera: “Another diamond guy?” Pernilla doesn’t fall for Simon’s charms, at least not romantically, but they become friends. She spends a wild summer travelling around the billionaire-friendly parts of Europe with him and his then-girlfriend, a Russian model. Until threats from his enemies mean he can’t access his money and, well, you understand the drill. There are many fascinating facets to this ugly story, most of them documented here. This is what happens when lives are lived online. Cecilie Googled Simon, she says, because that is what you are supposed to do with a match. She found him to be out there, in public, as the man he said he was. His Instagram seemed to confirm his identity. We hear voice notes from Simon, pulled from women’s messaging archives, and see romantic videos he sent from private jets. There are Cecilie’s videos of her looking around luxury flats that Simon told her to rent for them to live in together. This lends it a particular intimacy. When the story finally became public, after an in-depth report by the Norwegian newspaper VG, the women had to face the social-media verdicts of strangers, who called them gold-diggers and worse. If this were fiction, it would be too far-fetched to be believable; with every jaw-dropping twist, you wonder how he got away with it. This gets to the heart of the horrifying emotional and financial damage these women endured and sustained. It also goes some way towards explaining how he got so many of them to fall for it. When the moving parts of Simon’s schemes come into focus, the scale of them is truly amazing. The Tinder Swindler picks away at each layer of the story. It is about looking for love online, and internet cons, and the magnetism of con artists who say just the right thing. It takes a turn into thriller territory, when the Norwegian press and then Interpol start to look for Simon. Finally, it becomes a story of resilience, even revenge, as another of Simon’s victims starts to work out how she can get at least some of her money and her pride back. It hints at issues with policing online activity that takes place across many countries, and at crimes that are considered “small”, despite their devastating effects on the victims. Netflix’s true-crime documentaries can be a mixed bunch. They tend to be sensationalist, overly long and undersatisfying. The Tinder Swindler is snappy and smart and leaves you wanting more, rather than scraping the barrel for every possible angle. It leaves plenty of questions unanswered – it lacks the neat resolution that might have made for a perfect ending. But that is life, which turns out to be not much like the movies at all.",Arts/Television & radio,The Tinder Swindler review – the gobsmacking true story of an internet con artist,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/02/the-tinder-swindler-review-the-gobsmacking-true-story-of-an-internet-con-artist
2/2/2022,"Roland Emmerich does disasters better than anyone else alive. This is a man who thrives on outrageous worst-case scenarios. The world being attacked by aliens. The world being attacked by giant lizards. The world being destroyed by climate change. The world being destroyed by climate change but in a slightly different way and with John Cusack inexplicably as the action hero. If you want a disaster to be bigger and more elaborate than anything you could possibly imagine, you need Emmerich in your corner. However, some disasters are worse than others. And this is why Emmerich just had to have the premiere party for his new film at his house.  Moonfall – in which the moon falls out of the sky and Halle Berry has to blow it up before it bangs into Earth – is out this week. Its studio, Lionsgate, had elaborate plans to celebrate its release. More that 1,000 people were due to be invited, and entire streets shut down to accommodate all the red carpets necessary to celebrate a film about life as we know it being extinguished by the moon. But, in predictable fashion, Omicron raised its ugly head and plans had to be scaled back dramatically. In the end, the premiere was held at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, with a quarter of the anticipated guests, and then everyone bundled back to Roland’s for the after-party where they were served pigs in blankets and mini cupcakes. Which does rather sound as if Emmerich panicked and did a trolley dash around the nearest M&S with a couple of hours to go. However, from all evidence it looks as though Emmerich pulled it off. Upon first hearing the Moonfall premiere had turned into a house party, I had images of warm cans of lager, people fighting over the Spotify playlist, and everyone leaving at 9pm because some idiot decided to get his acoustic guitar out. But according to a video posted by Variety columnist Marc Malkin, it was a swanky event indeed. The video shows all manner of beautiful people milling around a pool while a band plays and spotlights shoot celebratory beams into the sky, presumably to make sure the moon hadn’t pivoted off its axis and embarked on an apocalyptic collision course with Earth. It looked perfect. It looked like something from La La Land, if La La Land parties had gigantic artificial moons dangling above the swimming pool to remind all the guests that certain death constantly lurks above, and all our lives could be obliterated in a second if anything in the universe fluctuates even slightly. .@MoonfallFilm party was at director Roland Emmerich’s house. pic.twitter.com/6JLWN1KPPO The whole thing is highly impressive. A bad situation presented itself and, without so much as breaking a sweat, Emmerich adapted and downscaled and, by the look of it, had a lovely time. Perhaps, in fact, this is the future of the premiere party. Compared to the actual Moonfall party, the original plans reek of waste and hubris. Why spend all that money putting on a show of might to hundreds of people who don’t really want to be there when you could just grab the people who mean the most to you and put the show on at home? Honestly, it doesn’t really matter. Am I less likely to go and see Moonfall because I know it was commemorated with a small party instead of a big party? No. My commitment to Moonfall remains unchanged, in that I still plan to watch it for free on a streamer six months from now when I am drunk. And, really, that’s the important thing here.",Arts/Film,Roland Emmerich’s Moonfall premiere party turned disaster into opportunity,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/02/roland-emmerich-moonfall-premiere-party
2/2/2022,"The Kremlin moved to belittle Boris Johnson on Wednesday, describing him as “utterly confused” and calling British diplomacy a waste of time. The concerted effort to ridicule Britain’s efforts to put itself at the helm of the fight to protect Ukraine came the day after Johnson flew to Kyiv to warn that a Russian invasion would be a humanitarian, political and military disaster for Moscow.  British efforts to arrange a phone call between Johnson and Vladimir Putin were in flux after a previously scheduled call on Monday had to be cancelled by the British because Johnson had to answer questions from MPs about alleged Covid rule-breaking parties in Downing Street. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it would provide details if and when Putin spoke to Johnson by phone, and Putin was ready to talk to anyone, including the “utterly confused”. Russia has said it has no plans to stage a new invasion of Ukraine, and has ridiculed Johnson’s claims that an invasion is imminent. The Russian deputy ambassador to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, told Sky News: “There is always room for diplomacy, but franklywe don’t trust British diplomacy. I think in recent years British diplomacy has shown that it is absolutely worthless in such issues, I am sorry to say. “I really don’t want to offend anybody, especially my good friends, British diplomats, but really, the results are nothing to boast about.” He added: “The hysteria just does not stop. What was happening is only in the heads of western politicians and not on the ground.” The UK has just taken over the chair of the UN security council, and Britain has had a number of run-ins with Polyanskiy, one of the more quotable Russian diplomats in recent years, on matters ranging from Syria, Libya, Ukraine and chemical weapons. Russian media is full of British media reports that Johnson attended prosecco-fuelled parties. Regarding the phone call, the Russian ambassador to London, Andrei Kelin, said in an interview with the Solovyov Live YouTube channel on Tuesday: “There is principled understanding that the conversation will take place. I hope it will be held because we really need to speak … but what about? Indeed, it should be understood that if Great Britain speaks from the positions it is looking at now – solidarity, intimidation, speculations about consequences – such a conversation will be not be long, I should say.” Johnson’s difficulties in securing a call with Putin contrasts with the two recent calls between the Russian president and France’s Emmanuel Macron, as well as a call between Putin and the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, supposedly a close ally of Johnson, was afforded a rare five-hour face-to-face discussion with Putin in what looked like an attempt to help Orbán secure his re-election in April. Johnson, given Britain’s forward stance on Ukraine, was never going to receive the red carpet treatment. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is still due to travel to Moscow for talks this week with his opposite number. The friction in the British-Russian relations came as papers were leaked detailing the offer Nato had put to Russia on possible detailed future disarmament talks. Putin has not yet formally replied to the proposals but said they did not meet his central call for a reversal of Nato expansion and the removal of offensive weapons close to Russia’s border. The papers show Nato demanding de-escalation by Russia around Ukraine but also displaying a willingness to hold discussions within the Nato-Russia council on arms controls, including intermediate missiles, greater transparency and discussions about the concept of the indivisibility of security, a potential way in which Russia could open up a dialogue on Nato troop deployments that leave Russia threatened. Russia has yet to decide if the Nato offer presents a lever into wider talks. Russia will be disappointed by Ukraine’s refusal to open talks on a special status for the Donbas, the Russian-supporting eastern part of Ukraine. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmitro Kuleba, said: “No Ukrainian region will have a right power for national state decisions. This is set in stone. There will be no special status, as Russia imagines it, no voting power. “We are carrying out a very deep decentralisation reform, and we are ready to work on the implementation of the Minsk agreements. But the Minsk agreements begin with security issues. The political part is in second place. So everyone must first focus on security.” The Minsk agreements negotiated in 2015 set out a roadmap for greater autonomy for the region, but there is a dispute over sequencing.",News/World news,Kremlin calls Boris Johnson’s Ukraine diplomacy efforts ‘utterly confused’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/kremlin-call-boris-johnson-ukraine-diplomacy-effort-utterly-confused-protect-russian-invasion
2/2/2022,"The north of England risks being left with “second-best” trains for 200 years under the government’s £96bn rail plan, the mayor of Greater Manchester has told MPs. Andy Burnham said that while his city would do better than most in the north, the plan would not “maximise the levelling-up benefits” that ministers claimed it would bring.  The integrated rail plan, published in November, axed the north-eastern leg of HS2 and angered leaders in the region by failing to include a new promised high-speed line linking cities across the north of England. Appearing before the transport select committee, Burnham said that while the investment would bring benefits, the north was being asked to settle for second best again. He said: “These are once-in-200-years decisions for the country and particularly for the north of England. If we get second best then the north will have second best for 200 years or more.” He added: “If we accept second best again, it’s our great-great-grandchildren who will grow up … with inferior transport and a smaller economy.” The chair of the committee, Huw Merriman, suggested that Manchester was the beneficiary of most of the £96bn investment, but Burnham said a large proportion of the HS2 spending included in that total was in the route south of Birmingham, to London. The redesigned plans for Manchester Piccadilly station, with HS2 trains now arriving overground, would cost a vast amount of city centre space as well as affecting how rail services could run to Leeds, he said. “More economic benefit could be achieved if the station was designed as an underground station with full connectivity,” the mayor said, adding that planners were “risking the mistakes of the past by bringing in HS2 on the surface”. He said an underground Piccadilly would allow regeneration for the centre to “be like the Canary Wharf of the north, a major success story”. Burnham said the Treasury had not done a levelling-up analysis of the economic benefits that would come from the rail plan. The question about the spending, he said, should be “does it maximise the levelling-up benefits – and I don’t believe it does”. Martin Tugwell, the chief executive of Transport for the North, said its own studies showed that building the promised line across the Pennines, linking Manchester, Bradford and Leeds, would bring an additional £14.4bn a year in gross value added, and 130,000 jobs across the country. He told the committee: “You make the economic potential of the north real, you contribute from the north to the rest of the UK, rather than it needing support from the rest of the UK to the north.” The testimony on Wednesday came after the secretary of state for levelling up, Michael Gove, unveiled long-awaited plans to close the gap between rich and poor parts of England. Gove dismissed claims there was no new money for the programme as a “bogus argument”.",News/UK news,"North of England faces ‘second-best trains’ for 200 years, warns Burnham",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/north-of-england-faces-second-best-trains-for-200-years-warns-burnham
