4/12/2022,"(Reuters) -Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful head of Russia's republic of Chechnya, said early on Monday that there will be an offensive by Russian forces not only on the besieged port of Mariupol, but also on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. ""There will be an offensive ... not only on Mariupol, but also on other places, cities and villages,"" Kadyrov said in a video posted on his Telegram channel. ""Luhansk and Donetsk - we will fully liberate in the first place ... and then take Kyiv and all other cities."" Kadyrov, who has often described himself as Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""foot soldier,"" said there should be no doubt about Kyiv. ""I assure you: not one step will be taken back,"" Kadyrov said. Kadyrov has been repeatedly accused by the United States and European Union of rights abuses, which he denies. Moscow fought two wars with separatists in Chechnya, a mainly Muslim region in southern Russia, after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. But it has since poured huge sums of money into the region to rebuild it and given Kadyrov a large measure of autonomy. The Kremlin describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour and on Sunday Russia intensified its attacks in eastern Ukraine.

4/12/2022,"Ukraine's defense ministry shared a video of a solider taking apart a Russian Orlan-10 drone Sunday. It shows the camera was a regular Canon and the fuel cap was made out of a bottle top. ""We even thought of sending this 'cosmic' technology to our Western partners,"" the soldier said. Ukraine's defense ministry shared a video showing a soldier dismantling a Russian military surveillance drone, highlighting a string of surprisingly unsophisticated features. In a video posted to Twitter on Sunday, a soldier can be seen seen taking apart what the ministry said was an Orlan-10 drone that crashed on Ukrainian soil. Insider was unable to independently verify when or where the footage was taken. In the video, the soldier is first seen pointing out that the drone's camera is a generic handheld Canon DSLR that had its main navigation button glued down to make sure it doesn't accidentally switch mode. The soldier then points out that the camera had been secured in place with a strip of adhesive tape. The soldier then points out that the cap of the drone's fuel tank appeared to have been made with the top and lid of a plastic water bottle. The footage also showed evidence that the drone had been covered in duct tape in several places. ""This is seriously real. Not fake,"" the soldier is heard saying, and joking: ""We even thought of sending this 'cosmic' technology to our Western partners."" A spokesperson for Ukraine's military said in 2017 that the Orlan-10 costs between five and seven million rubles ($87,000 to $120,000) per unit. The Orlan-10 usually carries a thermovision camera, photo camera, video camera, radio transmitter, and a retransmitter, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Security Service said in 2014. Ukraine said it had shot down a number of Russian Orlan-10 drones since Russia's invasion, which began on February 24. On April 8, Ukraine's 24th brigade posted an image of an Orlan drone to Facebook which appeared to also have a part of a water bottle as its primary fuel storage unit. Russia's assault on Ukraine has slowed in recent weeks, with Ukraine warning that Russian forces may be preparing for a new all-out assault on the eastern Donbas region. Speaking to the German newspaper Bild, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the worst was yet to come. ""It could be a big war in Donbas — like the world has not seen in hundreds of years,"" he said. ""We will go on defending our country until the end.""

4/12/2022,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reportedly said Russia's war with Ukraine is ""meant to"" stop US-led global domination. ""This domination is built on gross violations of international law,"" Lavrov said, according to RT. Russia President Vladimir Putin launched Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Monday that Russia's unprovoked war with Ukraine is ""meant to put an end"" to US-led global domination and the expansion of NATO, according to a report. ""Our special military operation is meant to put an end to the unabashed expansion [of NATO] and the unabashed drive towards full domination by the US and its Western subjects on the world stage,"" Lavrov told the state-owned television news channel Rossiya 24, according to a translation from Russian state-run media outlet RT. Additionally, Lavrov accused the United States of international law violations due to what he said were America's attempts to impose its own ""rules-based international order,"" according to the report. ""This domination is built on gross violations of international law and under some rules, which they are now hyping so much and which they make up on a case-by-case basis,"" Lavrov said during the interview, RT reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, with Russian troops surrounding and shelling towns and cities across the country. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Monday that at least 1,842 civilians have been killed in attacks across Ukraine, though it said ""the actual figures are considerably higher."" Additionally, more than 4.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country during Russia's invasion, the UN said. When Putin announced his invasion of Ukraine, he said he was seeking the ""denazification"" of Ukraine, a country whose democratically-elected leader, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is Jewish. Putin has made other attempts to defend the war with baseless claims that genocide was being committed against ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's pursuit of NATO membership has also been cited by Putin as a justification for his decision to invade Ukraine. Zelenskyy said in March said he has ""cooled down"" about Ukraine's bid to join NATO. Earlier last month, Lavrov offered up another reason for Russia invading Ukraine, saying that the Kremlin was trying to prevent a separate war in Ukraine. ""The goal of Russia's special military operation is to stop any war that could take place on Ukrainian territory or that could start from there,"" Lavrov said, according to a tweet that was posted by the Russian embassy in London. Since Russia invaded, Ukrainian forces have put up fierce resistance, resulting in heavy losses for Russian troops despite Ukrainian troops being largely outnumbered and outgunned by the Russians.

4/12/2022,"By Francois Murphy VIENNA (Reuters) -Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer held ""very direct, open and tough"" talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday, in Putin's first meeting with a European Union leader since the invasion of Ukraine started more than six weeks ago. Neutral Austria, which obtains 80% of its natural gas from Russia, generally maintains closer ties to Moscow than much of the European Union but that has not been the case recently. Nehammer has expressed solidarity with Ukraine and denounced apparent Russian war crimes, while his government has joined other EU countries in expelling Russian diplomats, albeit only a fraction of the large Russian diplomatic presence there. ""This is not a friendly visit,"" Nehammer was quoted as saying in a statement issued by his office shortly after the meeting at Putin's official Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow. A Nehammer spokesman said the meeting lasted 75 minutes, which is relatively short by Putin's standards. Nehammer repeated previous comments that he had hoped to help bring an end to the conflict or improvements for Ukraine's beleaguered civilian population such as humanitarian corridors. He gave little away about Putin's response. ""The conversation with President Putin was very direct, open and tough,"" Nehammer said in the statement. Having been visibly moved by telephone conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Nehammer visited Ukraine on Saturday to show support for Kyiv. He said he felt meeting Putin was his duty so as to ""leave no stone unturned"" in seeking an end to the conflict or humanitarian improvements. ""My most important message to Putin was that this war must finally end, because in a war there are only losers on both sides,"" he said in the statement. While German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he welcomed the meeting, the reactions at home have included surprise, scepticism and even outright condemnation. ""Let's hope there is more to the Austrian chancellor #Nehammer's visit to Putin than has been said and meets the eye. Austria has all too often served the role of Moscow's useful idiot in the past,"" professor of comparative Austrian politics at the University of Salzburg Reinhard Heinisch said on Twitter https://twitter.com/reinhardheinis1/status/1513396220160626689?s=20&t=1JT2az6tHjOo6AwTCHGCfQ. Conservative Nehammer's coalition partner, the left-wing Greens, went even further, criticising the visit. ""I cannot condone a visit to Putin,"" the Greens' foreign affairs spokesperson Ewa Ernst-Dziedzic wrote on Twitter https://twitter.com/dziedzic_ewa/status/1513201667835052032?s=20&t=1JT2az6tHjOo6AwTCHGCfQ.

4/12/2022,"Engineer Matt Swanson was working in the home office of his Baldwin Park apartment a few days ago when his wife, Katelynn, came in crying. “She was hard sobbing, couldn’t catch her breath,” Swanson said. “I asked ... ‘Did someone die?’” It wasn’t that. Instead, the Swansons had received the renewal notice from their landlord. The monthly rent on their two-bedroom was going up by $703, from $1,747 to $2,450 — a 40% increase. “We are essentially facing financial eviction,” said Swanson, 29. Such sticker shock is common for Orlando renters as skyrocketing demand pushes rents to new heights, a situation experts say isn’t likely to end anytime soon. “I wish I could tell you that we’re going to have some moderation in rents. I just don’t see it,” said Jonas Bordo, CEO of apartment listing website Dwellsy. “I think we’re going to see more aggressive price increases.” The median asking rent in metro Orlando in March was $2,295, according to Dwellsy, a 57% increase year-over-year. Orlando ranked No. 8 on cities with the highest increase in the nation. Tampa with a 56% increase and Jacksonville with 53% were the only other Florida cities to make the top 10. Tuscon, Arizona, took the top spot with a 139% increase. Swanson said his rent at Azul Baldwin Park went up by $100 last year, and he had expected something similar this year. But, he added, “a hundred in a normal year would feel like a lot.” Azul Baldwin Park did not return a request for comment. Swanson was given 30 days to agree to the new lease. He says the search for a more reasonably priced apartment has been frustrating. “There’s not a lot of availability,” he said. “The ones that are available are the most expensive models.” Metro Orlando has only a 5.2% vacancy rate, according to data analysts CoStar. Swanson says he has all but given up on finding a new apartment. “Our approach now is to find as affordable of a rental house as we can, even if we have to make some concessions about quality or location,” he said. But that might be difficult for him, too. Rental homes have seen demand sharply increase since the pandemic, Bordo said. The median asking rent for a single-family home was $2,400 per month in March, compared with $1,681 for apartments, according to Dwellsy. “By far, that’s the type of home everyone wants right now,” Bordo said. “Everybody wants a little more space.” More than 95% of single-family rentals are owned by small investors who may only own a couple of properties, making it a difficult market to track. Bordo said one possible stabilizing factor in rents might come from the rise of institutional single-family rental investors, such as American Homes 4 Rent, which built the Crestridge at Leesburg, a rental home community. Only about 3% of the market is held by such institutional investors, a number that is growing rapidly, especially in mid-sized cities such as Orlando. “Those middle-expense markets tend to be where they have put the most focus,” Bordo said. “They should, in the long run, reduce prices by producing more stable inventory.” However, Bordo acknowledges that the presence of these new players is also putting added pressure on the housing market, which moves prices higher. “[Since] there’s an additional source of demand on homes, that’s going to raise prices,” he said. Much of the rise in rents is a reflection of the housing market, which in Orlando has seen inventory set new record lows four times in the past year. “That’s creating a short supply situation while demand is going through the roof,” Bordo said. The Swansons both have graduate degrees. Katelynn works as a personal trainer and Matt has been making six figures for two years. They were planning on saving another year to buy a house and start a family. Instead, “it feels like someone is digging the ground out from under me,” Matt Swanson said. “It’s easy to say ‘Oh, man, housing is nuts right now,’ and think nothing else about it,” he said in an email, “but when confronted with the reality of $700 more a month for the exact same apartment the gravity of what these companies are doing really lands.”",Business/Orlando Sentinel,Orlando residents face ‘financial eviction’ as rents skyrocket with no end in sight,https://news.yahoo.com/orlando-residents-face-financial-eviction-081500516.html
4/12/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia said on Monday that it had used cruise missiles to destroy S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems which had been supplied to Ukraine by an unidentified European country. Russia launched Kalibr cruise missiles on Sunday against four S-300 launchers which were concealed in a hangar on the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, the defence ministry said. Russia said 25 Ukrainian troops were hit in the attack. ""High-precision sea-launched Kalibr missiles destroyed the equipment of a S-300 anti-aircraft missile division which had been delivered to the Kyiv regime by a European country,"" the ministry said. Russia did not say which European country had supplied the S-300 systems. NATO member Slovakia, which had donated such a missile system to Ukraine, said the one it supplied had not been hit. ""Our S-300 was not destroyed,"" Slovak government spokesperson Lubica Janikova said. Russian forces also shot down two Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft near the city of Izium and destroyed two ammunition depots, one of which was near the southern city of Mykolaiv, the Russian defence ministry said. The Ukrainian military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""It's the least that we can do,"" a spokesperson for Lithuanian Railways said. Russians taking the train from Moscow to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad have to pass through Vilnius station in Lithuania. When their train pauses at the platform, they are greeted with 24 large posters depicting the war in Ukraine. The posters show pictures of corpses, injured civilians, grieving families, destroyed homes and infrastructure, and child refugees. All posters have the same message: ""Today, Putin is killing civilians in Ukraine. Do you support this?"" ""As far as we know, Russians are shielded from what is happening in Ukraine.""Maybe we can change the minds of a very small number of passengers,"" Mantas Dubauskas, a spokesperson for the state-owned Lithuanian railways, who have erected the posters, told Reuters. ""It's the least that we can do,"" he added. The Russian parliament recently passed a law criminalizing the spread of ""fake"" news regarding the invasion of Ukraine.

4/12/2022,"Late Saturday evening, former President Donald Trump officially endorsed his old TV pal Dr. Mehmet Oz in the raucous Republican U.S. Senate primary race in Pennsylvania. In doing so, Trump, while speaking at a rally in North Carolina, ignited fury and ridicule among some of the loudest voices in Trumpworld. At issue among Trump’s most fervent supporters is the belief that Oz, a Turkish-American TV physician who has hobnobbed with Hollywood’s elite and has flip-flopped on the issue of abortion, isn’t a trustworthy “America First” Republican candidate, compared to fellow candidate Dave McCormick, who has ex-Trump administration official Hope Hicks by his side. (Another Trumpworld stalwart, Stephen Miller, stopped all involvement and employment with the McCormick campaign after Trump’s Oz endorsement, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told The Daily Beast after this story was published.) “I have enormous respect for President Trump. I was honored to have his endorsement in PA. Twice,” Sean Parnell, the former Trump-backed candidate, who dropped out of the race after an abuse allegation surfaced from his estranged ex-wife, wrote on Twitter. “But I’m disappointed by this. Oz is the antithesis of everything that made Trump the best president of my lifetime.” Dr. Oz’s Sick Journey From Political Joke to Senate Candidate The infighting only intensified as more conservative commentators and politicos lined up to take shots at Trump’s endorsement. “It’s like Donald Trump’s staff is sabotaging Trump by convincing him to make the worst possible endorsements,” conservative radio host Erick Erickson tweeted. “This endorsement could divide MAGA in the only way that matters: he could lose America First conservatives over it,” Breitbart News’ Joel Pollak wrote. Elsewhere, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), who is running for the Senate and who has split with Trump in recent over back-and-forth accusations of election interference, chalked up the Oz endorsement to weak-kneed staffers the ex-president has enlisted. “This is happening because Trump’s surrounded himself by staff who are on McConnell’s payroll & hostile to the MAGA agenda. Everybody telling Trump who to endorse in primaries works for The Swamp,” said Brooks, whose Trump endorsement was recently rescinded. “They played him. Again.” But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) didn’t immediately jump in on backing Oz during an interview with Fox News Sunday, stating, “I think we’re in a good position to win that race regardless of who the nominee is.” Inside Dr. Oz’s Shameless Flip-Flop on Abortion Longtime Republican operative Roger Stone couldn’t help joining the pile-on either, writing on Telegram, “Wait? President [Trump] endorsed this guy?” while attaching a photo of the doctor, who rose to infamy after years of hosting a daytime television show with guests like Michelle Obama. Lesser-known pro-Trump media personalities also stepped into the fold, including Townhall columnist Kurt Schlichter, who wrote: “It’s pretty hard for me to fully express how disappointed in Trump I am for endorsing Oz.” “Wait. Is there anything conservative about Dr. Oz?” Blaze TV’s Allie Beth Stuckey added. While the likes of far-right radio host Stew Peters continue to take nightly jabs at Oz, the doctor has an ally in Fox News host Sean Hannity. “I am supporting his nomination to be the Republican candidate,” Hannity said in March. “I have known him for many, many years.” Read more at The Daily Beast.
