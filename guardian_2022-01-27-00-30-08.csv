1/27/2022,"Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is under pressure in Brussels to drop his objection to an EU military training mission in Ukraine, as Berlin faces heavy criticism at home and abroad over its approach to Russia. According to diplomatic sources, Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, raised the issue of the mission at a meeting of ministers from the 27 member states on Monday and asked opponents of the plan to reconsider.  Officials at the EU’s foreign affairs wing, the external action service, are expected to make further efforts in the coming weeks to convince Berlin to give the green light. Italy, Spain, Austria and Greece are among those who also oppose the proposal, according to EU sources. Such EU training missions to build up armies have previously been established in Mali and Somalia. Germany instead favours establishing a “European peace facility”, a financing programme which could help in reforming the Ukrainian armed forces, which the government in Berlin believes would be better suited to EU goals. A communique issued after a meeting on Monday of EU foreign ministers said only that the bloc was “was defining modalities of support to Ukraine also in the area of professional military education”. A spokesperson for Borrell declined to comment on the confidential discussions. He said: “On the issue of a possible EU training mission to Ukraine I can confirm that discussions among the member states continue. “We are intensifying the work in this regard. We hope that the decision, which is for the member states to take in unanimity, will be taken soon. On our side, we will continue accelerating the preparatory work to deploy such a mission if member states agree on that. “In light of evolving developments, we need to move forward quickly. This message was clearly conveyed by the high representative for foreign affairs to the foreign ministers on Monday.” While the US and the EU have stressed their unified position on the threat posed to peace from the 106,000 Russian troops on Ukraine’s eastern border, Scholz has faced heavy criticism over his relatively cautious approach to the crisis. “You hear nothing from him”, said one diplomatic source in Brussels. “The political signalling is really weak”. The German government’s stance on the EU training mission has been referenced by some in Brussels as evidence of Berlin’s fear of provoking the Kremlin. There is also growing criticism of a delay in German approval on arms exports to Ukraine. Estonia has been seeking to send Soviet-made D-30 howitzers to Kyiv. The arms were previously stationed in the former German Democratic Republic, in east Germany, meaning approval is required from the German government. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said on Tuesday that it was a “huge disappointment” that Berlin had been withholding permission. Meanwhile Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, provoked an angry response in Kyiv after announcing on Wednesday that her country would supply 5,000 military helmets to Ukraine. Earlier this week Ukraine’s ambassador in Berlin had urged the German government to help equip militia fighters with 100,000 helmets and protective vests. Lambrecht said the delivery of helmets sent “a very clear signal: we are on your side”. But Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion who previously lived in Germany, called the delivery of 5,000 helmets a “joke”. “The behaviour of the German government leaves me speechless. The defence ministry apparently hasn’t realised that we are confronted with perfectly equipped Russian forces that can start another invasion of Ukraine at any time,” he told Germany’s largest tabloid Bild. “What kind of support will Germany send next,” he asked. “Pillows?” Officials from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France were holding diplomatic negotiations in Paris on Wednesday in the so-called Normandy formatborn out of the hostilities in 2015, a year after Vladimir Putin ordered the annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow expected a “good frank” talk at the Paris meeting.",News/World news,Germany under pressure to back EU military training mission in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/russia-ukraine-germany-under-pressure-to-back-eu-military-training-mission-in-ukraine
1/27/2022,"The Normandy format is an informal forum that was set up by French, German, Russian and Ukrainian diplomats in 2014, after Russia kickstarted a separatist conflict in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. It takes its name from the Normandy landings in the second world war. The first meeting took place in Normandy on the margins of the ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the allied landings.  Not much. The Minsk protocol – a 2014 agreement reached in the Belarusian capital that sought to end the war in Ukraine – was mediated by France and Germany under the Normandy format. But it failed to stop the fighting, and a new package of measures – known as Minsk II – was signed in February 2015, after a fraught 16 hours of negotiations. This also did not end the fighting, though the Normandy format parties agreed that it was the basis for any future resolution to the conflict. Russia’s insistence that it is not a party to the conflict, and therefore is not bound by the terms of the Minsk agreements, has impeded progress. The protocols were seen as complicated and fragile attempts to bring peace to eastern Ukraine, but at their heart they tried to reconcile Ukraine’s demand for full sovereignty over its territory with Russia’s insistence that the Russian-speaking people of eastern Ukraine required autonomy. They called for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the battle zone, amnesties on both sides and exchanges of prisoners and hostages. Two schemes – the Morel plan and the Steinmeier formula – were floated in 2015 and 2016. Both proposed a “special status” law for the Donbas region that would come into force on the day of elections, if they were deemed free and fair by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Neither proposal was accepted by Kyiv, since Russian troops would remain during the elections. After a three-year pause, leaders of the Normandy format met in Paris in December 2019. It was the first meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who had been elected as president of Ukraine in a landslide victory in April. Zelenskiy had made ending the war one of his campaign promises. Tentative agreements on prisoner exchanges and a total ceasefire were reached, but there was no political breakthrough to the now five-year-old conflict. The outcome was described as a draw. In his autobiography, David Cameron admitted it looked as if the UK had been carved out of the diplomatic effort in 2014, but maintained that he and Barack Obama did not want to grant Putin a large-scale meeting that could overshadow the commemorations of the liberation of France. “I was quite happy for the UK and the US to watch from a distance,” he wrote. Others, including his deputy, Nick Clegg, said it was a big strategic mistake for which the UK has since paid.",News/World news,Ukraine tensions: what is the Normandy format and has it achieved anything?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/ukraine-russia-tensions-what-is-the-normandy-format-and-has-it-achieved-anything
1/27/2022,"China’s ambitious low-carbon goals will not be realised easily and should not come at the expense of energy and food security or the “normal life” of ordinary people, its president, Xi Jinping, has said, signalling a more cautious approach to the climate emergency as the economy slows. China, the world’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, has been under pressure to “enhance ambition” and take more drastic action to tackle global heating. In the past two years, Beijing has also made a number of pledges to show its commitment.  But as the economy slows, China is worried about the risk to jobs and growth. The concern is particularly serious as Beijing prepares to hold a Communist party meeting that is expected to extend Xi’s rule later this year. Late on Monday, Xi told Communist party leaders that China needed to “overcome the notion of rapid success” and proceed gradually. “Reducing emissions is not about reducing productivity, and it is not about not emitting at all, either,” he was quoted as saying by the state news agency Xinhua. “We must stick to the overall planning and ensure energy security, industrial supply chain security and food security at the same time as cutting carbon emissions,” Xi said. Xi also cautioned against a campaign-style decarbonisation but advocated for coordinated national measures. “[We should] consider the reality of the regional resources and industry distribution … avoid uniform steps and one-size-fits-all,” he added. The cautious tone, according to Yan Qin, a lead analyst at Refinitiv financial analysis in Norway, has emerged since late last year, whenChina experienced a sudden power shortage that affected millions of households. “This in practice means less restrictions on fossil fuel. For example the policy goal in the 14th five-year plan is only to limit growth in coal consumption.” But Qin said the cautious approach did not mean Beijing was reneging on its promises. “The fact that this topic was discussed at the first study session of the year at the politburo indicates the top leadership is holding on to the pledges,” she said. “In short, Xi’s message was: it is still important, but let’s be sturdy and not to rush for results.” Since a national economic work meeting at the end of last year, policymakers have repeatedly emphasised China would “prioritise stability” in 2022. This showed the extent of the ruling elite’s concern for the economy, the world’s second-largest. The approach has already started to feed into policymaking, with Zhang Bo, chief engineer of the ministry of ecology and environment, telling reporters earlier this week that China would not impose strict water quality targets on local governments, and would instead encourage them to “consolidate” previous gains. With energy supplies still a big concern after a wave of shortages hit manufacturers last year, Xi also told party leaders that “the gradual withdrawal of traditional energy must be based on the safe and reliable replacement by new energy”. China has promised to accelerate the shift to renewables, but will only start to reduce coal consumption – a major source of CO2 – after 2025. Its state planning agency also said in December that it will loosen blanket restrictions on energy consumption in order to ensure environmental targets do not erode growth. In November at the Cop26 summit, China and the US announced a surprise plan to work together on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the crucial next decade. The world’s two biggest emitters unveiled a joint declaration that would see them cooperate closely on the emissions cuts scientists say are needed in the next 10 years to stay within 1.5C. China and the US said they would work together on some specific areas, such as cutting methane – a powerful greenhouse gas – and emissions from transport, energy and industry.

1/27/2022,"Iwas born in London but I’ve also lived and taken photographs in Wales, France and the US. I’ve now been based in St Leonards-on-Sea, on the south coast of Britain, for 33 years, which is the longest I’ve lived anywhere. This picture was taken in 2006, on the seafront half a mile from my house. I’d just come out of the shop on the left of the picture when I saw these two. The guy was standing in the sun with his companion on his shoulder, as if they were both basking. I don’t remember spotting them on the way in, it was as if they’d just materialised.  He looked quite forbidding, but I assumed anyone walking around with an exotic pet is going to expect some attention and comments. I just said: “I like your lizard.” He told me it was a bearded dragon and was happy to move around a bit until I had the lizard’s head where I wanted it. Other than that, I don’t remember us talking very much and as soon as I had the shot I was after I thanked him and left him still standing there. I like that I’m reflected in the mirror shades and you can see I’m shooting up close, and I like that you can’t tell for sure whether or not he’s naked. There are other details that amuse me, such as the long shadow cast by his nipple. I’m not sure which particular Hastings Pier Shock is being referred to in the newspaper billboard, but you can see the pier in the background if you look closely. It burned down in 2010 and remained derelict for years. I’ve been documenting the people around me since the 1960s, and have never been short of subjects. This town is rich in weird events and striking characters, but then if you carry a camera everywhere, as I do, and stay alert, that’s true of anywhere. I’ll sometimes drive past people or situations I would love to photograph and I have to backtrack. Or I’ll spot the same interesting-looking person a number of times before the right opportunity arises to photograph them. Another of my St Leonard’s photographs has a quite fierce-looking girl being towed down the street by an enormous dog. I’d seen them before and thought they were interesting but it wasn’t until I found myself right in their path one day that I took the chance. The girl, the dog and a kid on a bike are all making direct eye contact, but none of us said anything, we just all continued on our way. Often I’ll strike up a conversation with subjects and ask their permission, but while shooting on the London Underground in the 1980s I learned to take photographs discreetly. I’d work in plain sight but in a manner that didn’t attract attention. I suppose it helps that people don’t seem to find me threatening. I never spotted the guy with his lizard again, but some years after I took it, the photograph was included in an exhibition of my work in town. I went in one day and the guy at the front desk pointed at the image and said: “Bob, that man was in here earlier looking for you.” He hadn’t left a name or contact details and he never found me. In 2020, however, I spent 12 days in hospital and shared a ward with a guy who I’m almost sure was the bearded dragon man. I’ve compared photos I took on my phone, and he looks exactly the same, just older. It seems odd now that I never asked, but he had become really pally with another patient who’d been bitten on the arse by a dog – they had a lovely rapport and I enjoyed just shooting the breeze with them and didn’t want to risk somehow spoiling the sense of camaraderie. Anyway, he did mention he lives just outside town. A book of my work came out a couple of years ago with that photograph on the cover, so if I ever track him down perhaps I’ll leave a couple of copies hanging from his door handle.

1/27/2022,"Much like the Hollywood star herself, Ava: The Secret Conversations is a visually striking and enigmatic affair. It’s written by and stars Elizabeth McGovern and is based on Peter Evans’s biography, which Ava Gardner collaborated on, but wouldn’t allow to be published in her lifetime. McGovern is best known for her starring role in Downton Abbey but it’s her experience as a lyricist that tells in a production that feels more like an album than a play; poetic and playful and rippling with elegant riffs on Ava’s life and the men who framed it. Director Gaby Dellal has worked largely in film and, alongside projection specialists 59 Productions, has created a show that splices film and theatre together with finesse. The play unfolds in Ava’s London flat, where Peter and Ava meet to discuss her life. As the two hit upon important moments and men (including Mickey Rooney, Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra), the flat’s walls slide, shuffle or drop away completely, and projected film reels and atmospheric backdrops transport us to a flurry of memorable times and places, many of which shimmer with a mysterious (sometimes threatening) sort of glamour.  Lots of the scenes are enclosed by big black frames that drop down in front of the stage and create small picture-box spaces, as if we’re peering through a camera lens. When powerful men speak (such as Peter’s agent, who keeps calling for stories of Sinatra’s penis), we often don’t see them – but only hear their voices booming from somewhere off stage. All this creates the powerful impression of omnipresent men lingering in the wings, picking and choosing how we view Ava’s story. McGovern gradually grows in magnetism, starting out rather depleted (thanks to a number of strokes in Ava’s later life) but gradually beginning to straighten up and sparkle. The chemistry between McGovern and Anatol Yusef, who plays all the male roles, never quite burns and when their big fallout happens, it feels manufactured. But this is still a thoughtful and classy show, which shows a woman who remained resolutely herself (but always kept something back) as the men in her life looked for themselves – and lost themselves – in her dazzling glow.

1/27/2022,"Visiting the Barbican estate in London is like entering a slightly different version of reality. Few places open to the general public feel as hermetic as the estate created by architects Chamberlin, Powell and Bon. If you visit to mark the Barbican Centre’s 40th anniversary next month, make sure you take it all in. Singular vision is also celebrated in Helsinki this month with an art show celebrating modern Finnish female artists. These remarkable women helped change European art in the early 20th century, and deserve more recognition. Read this month’s news to find out more about them.  For more news on architecture, sustainable living, art, fashion and new ideas, sign up for our monthly newsletter here The shortlist for the Brookfield Properties Craft Award has been revealed. The final winner will be announced during the Collect Craft Fair in London at the end of February. The five artists shortlisted for the prize have been judged to have made a significant contribution to contemporary craft and making in the UK. They stand to win £60,000, have a solo British show in summer 2022 and one of their works will be purchased for the UK’s Crafts Council’s prestigious collection. From the shortlist, Anthony Amoako-Attah and Dawn Bendick both work with glass, though Amoako-Attah uses powered glass to produce pieces that look like fabric and Bendick’s dichroic glass sculptures play with light and colour. Two other finalists work with textiles. Cecilia Charlton’s embroideries are inspired by feminism, the history of textiles and time; Christian Ovonlen’s silk hangings reference Ballets Russes and theatre productions from the 19th and 20th century. The remaining finalist is Irina Razumovskaya, a Russian-Israeli ceramic sculptor whose architectural works have an innovative, glazed finish. “The shortlist reflects a shared appetite of the Crafts Council and Brookfield Properties for the exciting diversity of craft being made today,” said Rosy Greenlees, executive director of the Crafts Council. “I look forward to the winner being announced.” Self-taught Ghanian artist Amoako-Attah had a particularly charming response to the news he’d been shortlisted. “To win this award would be a massive step in my life, as my source of happiness is making work in the studio. Being part of the shortlist signals that the future is bright when determination, love, dedication, and creativity fuel our dreams.” The winner will be announced on 24 February at Somerset House, London, the venue for the Crafts Council’s Collect 2022 art fair Most of us appreciate the appeal of a vintage pair of jeans. Now, thanks to Levi’s, second-hand takes on a new meaning as the American denim giant launches a new version of its most iconic product, 501 jeans, made with organic cotton and ‘post-consumer, recycled denim. The new circular 501s build on a 2020 collaboration with Renewcell, a Swedish textile recycling company. The jeans use a mix of Renewcell sustainably sourced viscose made in part from recycled denim and organic cotton. This combination means the jeans’ production uses fewer natural resources and fewer chemicals. “We’re hoping to show ourselves and the industry that we can deliver more sustainable product that looks great, and meets the highest quality standards,” says Paul Dillinger, Levi’s VP of design innovation. Each year fashion brands manufacture approximately six billion pairs of jeans at enormous cost the planet, using millions of gallons of water, creating chemical waste and chucking greenhouse gasses into the environment. A new line of circular 501s isn’t going to reverse that. But leading by example can help. As more household brands take the environment seriously, buying brand new will become one thing every fashion brand fears. Unfashionable. Finland has been named the happiest place in the world four years running, and the second best place in the world to be a woman. The country has long been a trailblazer in gender parity and women’s rights, and a new art show at Anteneum, the national gallery in Helsinki, looks at the impact this has had on Finland’s female artists. The Modern Woman looks at the work of 12 Finnish female artists from around the turn of the 20th century. Finland was one of the first countries to give women the right to vote, back in 1906. These women could enrol in art school, travel independently. They still encountered the sexism endured by women, but with better opportunities to focus on their careers. The show includes work by Ellen Thesleff who cofounded Finland’s Septem group in 1909. This association of French-influenced artists advocated the use of pure colours and introduced Impressionism to Finland. There are also bronze sculptures by Hilda Flodin on show. She trained as Rodin’s assistant and was one of Finland’s first and finest etchers. Living in a time when women were fighting for emancipation, these artists often chose women as subjects in their art. Helene Schjerfbeck is renowned for self-portraits but other modern women are also commemorated throughout this show. The Modern Woman gives a unique insight into the work and lives of these exceptional artists. Talented women who, like so many in the history of art, haven’t received the recognition they deserve. The Modern Woman is at the Ateneum gallery in Helsinki from 11 February Greek fashion designer Mary Katrantzou is best known for her kaleidoscopic bejewelled print dresses, fabulously OTT creations that have been worn by Beyoncé and Adele among others. On first appearances, then, her latest collaboration may seem like a curveball. She’s designed a collection of bathroom tiles. The line, in partnership with venerable ceramicists Villeroy & Boch, features butterflies and elements of postage stamp design and is intended to bring “the natural world into the living environment”. In fact Katrantzou has form with designs for the home. Her mother was an interior designer and, before transferring to Central Saint Martins to get her degree in fashion, she studied architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design. Her dresses have previously taken inspiration from the Bauhaus movement, Olivetti typewriters and Minoan artifacts. In 2019 she launched a range of rugs. “This collection allowed me to look at patterns outside the female figures and be guided instead by the power of interiors,” Katrantzou says of the tile collection, named ‘Victorian’ after the era that inspired them. Each colourful butterfly design is offset with gold, black or perforated boarders, while the tiles can be set either straight-on or at a 45-degree angle. Or, presumably, fashioned into a catwalk if you wanted to complete the connection. Tiles are available to order from March at Villeroy & Boch For regular news on architecture, design and sustainable living, sign up for the Design Review newsletter The Barbican estate was conceived as part of a utopian vision to revive east London after it was destroyed in air raids during the second world war and the Barbican Centre – a Brutalist masterpiece which took over a decade to complete – was declared ‘one of the modern wonders of the world’ by the Queen when she opened it in 1982. The arts centre has become an institution - a resource for local communities and an inspiration for artists. The Barbican Centre marks its 40th anniversary next month. Planned events include performances by the Barbican’s resident orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra. There’ll be a major new exhibition Postwar Modern: New Art in Britain 1945-1965, reassessing art produced in Britain during the 20 years after the war.

1/27/2022,"The Catalan parliament is on Wednesday expected to pass a resolution to pardon up to 1,000 people – the majority of them women – condemned for the crime of witchcraft in the region 400 years ago. The move follows similar gestures in Scotland, Switzerland and Norway after more than 100 European historians signed a manifesto titled: They weren’t witches, they were women.  The resolution, which follows a campaign in the local history journal Sapiens, is supported by the leftwing and nationalist parties in the parliament. Commenting on a TV3 documentary entitled Witches, the Big Lie, the Catalan president, Pere Aragonès, described the witch-hunts as “institutionalised femicide”. It is estimated that between 1580 and 1630, about 50,000 people were condemned to death for witchcraft across Europe, of whom about 80% were women. While witch-hunts raged across northern Europe, in Spain the Inquisition had its hands full rooting out heresy among Jews and Muslims who had been forcibly converted to Christianity. The Inquisition was sceptical about allegations of witchcraft. Catalonia was the exception, however, and witch-hunts persisted well into the 18th century there. What is thought to be the first European law against witchcraft was passed in Lleida in 1424. According to Pau Castell, a professor of modern history at the University of Barcelona, witch-hunts were more common in Catalonia because rural areas came under the absolute power of feudal lords, and confession alone was sufficient proof of guilt. He added that, paradoxically, in cases where the Inquisition was called in, the accused were often set free for lack of evidence. Witches were frequently blamed for the sudden death of children or for natural catastrophes and poor harvests, Castell said. According to the historian Núria Morelló, suspects were often practitioners of traditional medicine or women of independent means, who were regarded with suspicion. Unlike the rest of Europe, witches in Catalonia were hanged, not burned at the stake. Castell said this may have been because it was cheaper and didn’t waste valuable firewood. Some Catalan villages hired their own witch-finders. One such was Joan Cazabrujas (John the witch-hunter) in the village of Sallent, whose accusations led to the hanging of 33 women. When the Inquisition later discovered that most of the women were innocent, it had Cazabrujas burnt at the stake. Ivet Eroles, the author of a book on witchcraft in Catalonia, cites the feminist slogan “we are the granddaughters of the witches they couldn’t burn” but says that “more to the point, we are the descendants of those who murdered them; we are the oppressors’ heirs”. Spain’s most notorious trial for witchcraft centred on the village of Zugarramurdi in Navarra, where it was claimed that men and women, including priests, practised witchcraft in a large cave. Before the trial began in nearby Logroño in 1609, altogether 7,000 people were investigated – an astonishing number given that even today, Zugarramurdi has a population of 225. Two thousand suspects confessed, nearly three-quarters of them children, but nearly all later retracted. In the end, 11 were condemned, of whom five had already died in prison. The remaining six – four women and two men – were burned at the stake. Children, one as young as five, were also prominent among the 200 accused of witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts, between 1692 and 1693. The witch-hunt was partly sparked by an influx of refugees resulting from Britain’s war with the French over Canadian territory, which fuelled local faction fighting. Fourteen women and five men were hanged, while another man was pressed to death with heavy weights. The colony later accepted the victims’ innocence and paid compensation to the families. Four children’s playgrounds in the Catalan village of Palau-solità i Plegamans have been named in honour of condemned witches and there are plans to name Catalan streets and squares as a form of memorial.",News/World news,"Catalonia expected to pardon up to 1,000 people accused of witchcraft",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/catalonia-expected-to-pardon-up-to-1000-people-accused-of-witchcraft
