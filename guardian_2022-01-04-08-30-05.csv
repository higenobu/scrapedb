1/4/2022,"The New South Wales teachers’ union has called for an urgent meeting with health and education officials to discuss safety at the onset of the new school year amid the growing Covid-19 outbreak in the state. The NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, warned absentee rates could cause chaos and said “serious questions” about safety needed to be answered before students return to classrooms in early February.  “The current plan is the plan we had when schools went into the vacation period,” he told Guardian Australia on Monday. “All that’s changed. We are now living in a very different context to what we were in the weeks prior to schools going into summer recess.” In highly vaccinated NSW, case numbers have exceeded 20,000 on some days over the Christmas period. Gavrielatos said schools were already heavily disrupted in 2021, when far fewer cases circulated in the state, with an average of about 40 schools a day affected by staff or students testing positive. “That was at a time when numbers were but a fraction of what we’re seeing today,” he said. “So clearly there’s a lot of concern.” The union is seeking an “urgent meeting” with education and health officials this week to ensure a proper plan is in place. “Who knows what that plan might look like? Who knows how many cases we might have?” Gavrielatos said. “There are a number of scenarios potentially at play here, including the possibility of remote learning in certain settings.” Gavrielatos said a multi-pronged approach to Covid-19 was sorely needed in schools, where vaccination rates differ from the general NSW population. As of Monday, 78.2% of NSW children aged 12-15 were double-vaccinated, compared with 93.6% of people 16 and older. The vast majority of primary school students are currently unvaccinated, with the rollout for children aged 5-11 to begin on 10 January. Among the union’s demands are “enhancements” of rules around masks and ventilation, with an “urgent audit and stocktake” needed on air purifiers. “We need to know what on earth is happening with rapid antigen testing,” Gavrielatos said. “We need to know what efforts are being made to procure and make available that other critical component in risk mitigation strategy.” Covid-19 has generally produced a milder illness in children than adults, though it is possible for children to become severely ill and in rare cases die. Research on children and the Omicron variant is still emerging. Towards the end of the 2021 school year, measures in place for NSW schools included physical distancing and outdoor lessons where possible, mandatory vaccinations for staff and compulsory masks for staff, visitors and students in year 7 and above. Masks were strongly recommended for primary school students.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ventilation advice was to open doors and windows. The department said advice from NSW Health, the Doherty Institute and the World Health Organization was that “maximising natural ventilation in our learning spaces is the most effective method for minimising the spread of Covid-19, as it is a very effective way to disperse particles in the air”. But there are concerns this will not always be possible in a hot Australian summer. The department has bought air purifiers, but they will not be brought in across the board and only used in situations where, for instance, bushfire smoke or poor air quality rules out opening the window. In the UK, similar ventilation advice was criticised as unworkable in the context of a harsh winter. The NSW education department website states “term 1 2022 settings are under review and will be updated as soon as possible”. The department’s media unit was unavailable to respond to questions on Monday due to the holiday break.",News/Australia news,Teachers seek urgent talks with NSW government on school safety amid Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/teachers-seek-urgent-talks-with-nsw-government-on-school-safety-amid-omicron-surge
1/4/2022,"Jeopardy! champion Amy Schneider scored her 23rd consecutive victory last week in a historic run that has made her the top-winning woman in the show’s history. But that’s not the only milestone Schneider has achieved on the show. The Oakland, California, resident is the fourth-best all time winner, with $855,600 in earnings, and the first transgender person to qualify for Jeopardy’s Tournament of Champions, an annual event with the game’s top players.  Schneider’s victories have catapulted her into the spotlight and made the engineering manager a beacon for LGBTQ+ visibility. “2021 wasn’t the best year for the world, but it turned out to be the best year I’ve ever had! Not only have I had this Jeopardy run, but I’ve heard from so many wonderful people,” Schneider said on Twitter. The 42-year-old, originally from Dayton, Ohio, said that since her victory streak had begun in November, people had recognized her at the grocery store. “It’s a fun feeling,” she said in an interview with Yahoo Entertainment. “I’m not going to be, like, Tom Hanks–level famous or anything! So, I think it’ll be manageable.” Schneider has said she’s dreamed of being a contestant on the show since age five. “I’ve always watched it and I’ve also always been interested in learning facts and stuff,” Schneider told Yahoo. “And as I mentioned on the show, in eighth grade I was voted most likely to be on Jeopardy! one day. It was always sort of in my mind that it might be something I did at some point.” Schneider has used Twitter and Instagram to chronicle her experience on the show, detailing the techniques she uses to tackle questions and recall facts about everything from the sinking of the Titanic to Major League Soccer teams, and her fashion choices, such as wearing a sweater to honor another high-ranking female Jeopardy! winner. The majority of her interactions online are positive, Schneider said, but she’s also faced anti-trans comments, to which she recently responded: “I’d like to thank all the people who have taken the time, during this busy holiday season, to reach out and explain to me that, actually, I’m a man. Every single one of you is the first person ever to make that very clever point, which had never once before crossed my mind.” Schneider has said she doesn’t “actually think about being trans all that often, and so when appearing on national television, I wanted to represent that part of my identity accurately: as important, but also relatively minor”. But her run on the show has had a major impact, families and advocates say. “Amy Schneider’s incredible run on Jeopardy! allows families all over the country to get to know her as someone who is great at word puzzles, has in-depth knowledge on a range of topics, and who also happens to be a transgender woman,” Nick Adams, Glaad’s director of transgender representation, said in a statement last month. “Amy is using her history-making appearances and new platform to raise awareness of transgender issues and share a bit of her personal story too.”",Arts/Television & radio,Amy Schneider makes Jeopardy! history after 23rd straight victory,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/03/amy-schneider-jeopardy-record
