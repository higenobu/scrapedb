1/8/2022,"An NHS doctor has challenged Sajid Javid over compulsory vaccines for healthcare workers, telling the health secretary: “I’ve not had a vaccination; I don’t want to have a vaccination.” The scene, which was caught by Sky News cameras, was first broadcast on Friday after Javid visited King’s College hospital in south London. It has been shared extensively on social media by both critics and supporters of vaccine mandates.  The government has decided that all NHS staff in England who have direct contact with patients must have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine by 3 February or risk losing their job at the end of March. On Friday, trade union leaders urged the government to delay the new rule, or risk an exodus of thousands of healthcare workers. While on a walkabout at King’s on Friday, Javid had asked doctors and nurses what they thought about government plans to require vaccination for all NHS staff. After a brief silence, Steve James, a consultant anaesthetist who has been working throughout the pandemic, replied: “I’m not happy about that.” James told Javid: “I’ve had Covid at some point, I’ve got antibodies, and I’ve been working on Covid ITUs since the beginning; I have not had a vaccination, I do not want to have a vaccination. The vaccine is reducing transmission only for about eight weeks with delta. With Omicron it’s probably less. And for that I would be dismissed if I don’t have a vaccine? The science isn’t strong enough.” “That’s your view,” Javid replied. Turning to a group of nurses he added: “And your views?” However, they did not respond. Turning back to James, Javid continued: “I respect that but there are also many different views.” Javid added: “I understand that but obviously we have to weigh all that up for both health and social care and there will always be a debate about it … ” James replied: “Maybe there is an opportunity to reconsider with Omicron and the changing picture, or at least the nuance that will allow doctors who have had antibody exposure, who’ve got antibodies, who haven’t had the vaccination, to not have it, because the protection I’ve got is probably equivalent to someone who is vaccinated.” “Yes, but at some point that will wane,” Javid said. James said: “But if you want to provide protection with a booster you’d have to inject everybody every month. If the protection has worn off for transmission after two months then after a month you’ve still got a bit of protection. But if you want to maintain protection you’re going to need to boost all staff members every single months, which you’re not going to do.” Javid answered his challenge by saying: “We take the very best advice that we can, from vaccine experts.” Half a day after the video was published on Twitter, it had been watched about 1.2m times.",News/Politics,NHS doctor challenges Sajid Javid over Covid vaccination rules,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/08/nhs-doctor-challenges-sajid-javid-over-covid-vaccination-rules
1/8/2022,"American democracy is in peril and nearly everyone paying attention is trying to find the best way to say so. Should we in the intellectual classes position our warnings in satire, in jeremiads, in social scientific data, in historical analogy, in philosophical wisdom we glean from so many who have instructed us about the violence and authoritarianism of the 20th century? Or should we just scream after our holiday naps? Some of us pick up our pens and do what we can. We quote wise scribes such as George Orwell on how there may be a latent fascist waiting to emerge in all humans, or Hannah Arendt on how democracies are inherently unstable and susceptible to ruin by aggressive, skilled demagogues. We turn to Alexis de Tocqueville for his stunning insights into American individualism while we love to believe his claims that democracy would create greater equality. And oh! how we love Walt Whitman’s fabulously open, infinite democratic spirit. We inhale Whitman’s verses and are captured by the hypnotic power of democracy. “O Democracy, for you, for you I am trilling these songs,” wrote our most exuberant democrat.  Read enough of the right Whitman and you can believe again that American democracy may yet be “the continent indissoluble … with the life-long love of comrades”. But just now we cannot rely on the genius alone of our wise forbears. We have to face our own mess, engage the fight before us, and prepare for the worst. Our democracy allows a twice-impeached, criminally inclined ex-president, who publicly fomented an attempted coup against his own government, and still operates as a gangster leader of his political party, to peacefully reside in our midst while under investigation for his misdeeds. We believe in rule of law, and therefore await verdicts of our judicial system and legislative inquiry. Yet Trumpism unleashed on 6 January, and every day before and since over a five-year period, a crusade to slowly poison the American democratic experiment with a movement to overturn decades of pluralism, increased racial and gender equality, and scientific knowledge. To what end? Establishing a hopeless white utopia for the rich and the aggrieved. On this 6 January anniversary is it time to sing anew with Whitmanesque fervor, or is the only rational response to scream? First the scream. On 6 January 2021, an American mob, orchestrated by the most powerful man in the land, along with many congressional and media allies, nearly destroyed our indirect electoral democracy. To this day, only Trump’s laziness and incompetence may explain why he did not fire Vice-President Mike Pence in the two months before the coup, install a genuine lackey like Mark Meadows, and set up the formal disruption of the count of electoral votes. The real coup needed guns, and military brass thankfully made clear they would oppose any attempt at imposing martial law. But the coup endures by failing; it now takes the form of voter suppression laws, virulent states’ rights doctrine applied to all manner of legislative action installing Republican loyalists in the electoral system, and a propaganda machine capable of popularizing lies big and small. The lies have now crept into a Trumpian Lost Cause ideology, building its monuments in ludicrous stories that millions believe, and codifying them in laws to make the next elections easier to pilfer. If you repeat the terms “voter fraud” and “election integrity” enough times on the right networks you have a movement. And “replacement theory” works well alongside a thousand repetitions of “critical race theory”, both disembodied of definition or meaning, but both scary. Liberals sometimes invite scorn with their devotion to diversity training and insistence on fighting over words rather than genuine inequality. But it is time to see the real enemy – a long-brewing American-style neo-fascist authoritarianism, beguilingly useful to the grievances of the disaffected, and threatening to steal our microphones midway through our odes to joy. Yes, disinformation has to be fought with good information. But it must also be fought with fierce politics, with organization, and if necessary with bodies, non-violently. We have an increasingly dangerous population on the right. Who do you know who really wants to compromise with their ideas? Who on the left will volunteer to be part of a delegation to go discuss the fate of democracy with Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy or the foghorns of Fox News? Who on the right will come to a symposium with 10 of the finest writers on democracy, its history and its philosophy, and help create a blueprint for American renewal? As a culture we are not in the mood for such reason and comity; we are in a fight, and it needs to happen in politics. Otherwise it may be 1861 again in some very new form. Unfortunately it is likely to take events even more shocking than 6 January to move our political culture through and beyond our current crisis. And if and when it is 1861 again, the new secessionists, namely the Republican party, will have a dysfunctional constitution to exploit. The ridiculously undemocratic US Senate, now 50/50 between the two parties, but where Democrats represent 56.5% of the population and Republicans 43.5%, augurs well for those determined to thwart majoritarian democracy. And, of course, the electoral college – an institution more than two centuries out of date, and which even our first demagogue president, Andrew Jackson, advocated abolishing – offers perennial hope to Republicans who may continue to lose popular votes but win the presidency, as they have in two of the last six elections. Democracy? And now the song? Well, keep reading. Of all the books on democracy in recent years one of the best is James Miller’s Can Democracy Work? A Short History of a Radical Idea, from Ancient Athens to Our World. A political philosopher and historian, Miller provides an intelligent journey through the turbulent past of this great human experiment in whether we can actually govern themselves. He demonstrates how thin the lines are between success and disaster for democracies, how big wins turn into reactions and big losses, and how the dynamics of even democratic societies can be utterly amoral. Intolerant new ruling classes sometimes replace the tyrants they overthrow. “Democratic revolts, like democratic elections,” Miller writes, “can produce perverse outcomes.” History is still waiting for us. But in the end, via examples like Václav Havel in the Czech Republic, Miller reminds us that the “ideal survives”. Democracy does require the “best laws”, Havel intoned, but it must also manifest as “humane, moral, intellectual and spiritual, and cultural”. Miller does the history to show that democracy is almost always a “riddle, not a recipe”. Democracy is much harder than autocracy to sustain. But renew it we must. Or simply pick up Whitman’s Song of Myself, all 51 pages, from the opening line, “I celebrate myself, and sing myself,” to his musings on the luck of merely being alive. Keep going to a few pages later when a “runaway slave” enters Whitman’s home and the poet gazes into his “revolving eyes”, and nurses “the galls of his neck and ankles”, and then to his embrace of “primeval”, complete democracy midway in the song, where he accepts “nothing which all cannot have”. Finally read to the ending, where the poet finds blissful oblivion, bequeathing himself “to the dirt to grow from the grass I love”. Whitman’s “sign of democracy” is everywhere and in everything. The democratic and the authoritarian instinct are both deep within us, forever at war. After 6 January, it’s time to prepare thee to sing, to scream, and to fight.

1/8/2022,"On her first visit to HMP Belmarsh, Rona McCandlish got lost. The prison is in a sprawling, out-of-the-way 1990s estate in Thamesmead, south-east London. It was November 2018 and McCandlish was on her way to interview for a volunteer position with the charity Pact, which gives advice and support to prisoners and their families. “I had to sprint half a mile in the end to get to the prison,” says McCandlish, who is 63 and lives in nearby Lewisham. She had got so lost, she showed up uncharacteristically late. “It helped me understand how alienating and confusing visiting a prison for the first time can be.”  At the time, McCandlish was feeling burned out. She’d worked as a midwife before becoming a professor of midwifery, a midwifery adviser to the government, then a consultant in NHS maternity services. “I was working 80 hours a week,” she says, “flying all over the country, staying in different places.” She needed to do something more community-focused, at a slower pace. “I was always dipping in and out of communities. Now I feel part of my own. Volunteering is much more than what you do for other people. It also does so much for you.” Despite her tardiness, McCandlish got the position. She volunteers at Belmarsh’s visitor centre, welcoming friends and family who are there to see inmates, and supporting them through the confusing and sometimes arcane regulations that govern prison visits. Visitors are forbidden from wearing ripped clothes, low-cut tops, short dresses, even watches. First-time visitors who aren’t aware of the rules risk being sent away. “People feel humiliated when they don’t have the right clothes,” says McCandlish. She and fellow volunteers have created Boutique Belmarsh: a rail of neutral, plain garments they lend to any visitor who falls foul of the dress regulations. McCandlish takes all the clothes home to launder between visits. But McCandlish does much more than just facilitate visits. “Rona is an amazing woman,” says her manager, Pact’s Monique Joseph. “She makes an extra effort to know each family member by name, creating a haven when they’re visiting. What makes Rona truly special is her ability to speak with people from many different backgrounds, faiths and ages.” McCandlish says: “It’s about listening to them, whether they’re hurt or angry or feeling hopeless. They’ll say things like, ‘Why didn’t I stop him from doing it? He was a good lad and I knew he was going off the rails’.” A young woman recently visited with her small baby. Her partner had just been given a seven-year sentence. “She was really in a lot of despair,” McCandlish says. “She never expected her partner to be put away for so long, and to have to bring the baby to see dad in prison.” It’s not all doom and gloom at the visitor centre, though. “It can be a joyful place at times,” she says. “People don’t expect it to be OK when they come here, yet after they visit, they feel relieved. They’re happy to see that the person they’re visiting is OK, and they know they’ve done the right thing by coming.” During the pandemic, visits were paused and resumed only in May this year. “That was emotional,” she says. “Watching visitors come for the first time in 18 months.” All these years witnessing the dehumanising effects of prison up close makes McCandlish question why we spend so much money locking people away, often for non-violent crimes. “I feel quite desperate sometimes,” she says. “There needs to be a focus on doing more than just building cages. It’s a great waste of resources to lock people up and not offer meaningful education, rehabilitation, support or therapy.” McCandlish wants to bring a sense of humanity to an otherwise drab and cold place. Outside the visitor centre, for example, hangs a tatty, withered plant that has seen better days. For her treat, McCandlish requests a fresh one to replace it, and some low-maintenance houseplants to dot around inside. Community garden centre the Nunhead Gardener provides McCandlish with a selection of plants and flowers, including a sansevieria “snake plant”, with its long, upright leaves, and the glossy zamioculca. “The new plant is huge and amazing,” says McCandlish of the hanging plant. “I’m slightly worried it will fall down, because it’s so massive.” The response has been overwhelmingly positive. It may seem like a small change, but the plants represent McCandlish’s approach to volunteering: finding ways to bring the light in and give a personal touch to an otherwise impersonal institution. “I want to make the centre a lovely place to come to,” she says. “Not a hard place. The main thing is for the people visiting to feel hope and connection.” There was some muttering about who would water the plants, but McCandlish, ever the volunteer, has taken full responsibility: “Plants are good for us. They make our lives better.” Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

1/8/2022,"After weeks of a diet whose main food groups comprise paté, cheese and Ferrero Rocher, I’ve started the new year with mind and gut crying out for a change. I won’t be indulging in any crash dieting, though. Instead, I’ll be shifting my focus to foods that nourish and satisfy and, in particular, feed the gut microbiome. These dishes rely on pulses, which are naturally full of fibre, to provide sustenance to all the microorganisms that make a home in our digestive system and help to keep us healthy. Both are also great to make in bulk and freeze, for days when you can’t face cooking but need something warm and comforting.  This stew is inspired by some of my favourite south-east Asian flavours.

Meanwhile, warm the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat, then fry the garlic, ginger, turmeric and chilli for one to two minutes, until the garlic starts to brown. Add the onions, fry, stirring, for eight minutes, until softening, then pour in the beans, peanut butter, coconut milk, water, lime zest and juice, fish and soy sauces, and sugar. Simmer for two to three minutes, then add the tofu and simmer for another five minutes. While the stew simmers, prepare the garnish. Peel the garlic cloves and slice them as thinly as you can. Warm the oil in a small frying pan over a low heat, then fry the garlic for a couple of minutes until hazelnut brown. Pour immediately into a heatproof bowl to stop it overcooking.

1/8/2022,"Tucked into hedgerows or peeping out from under trees, the stinking iris, Iris foetidissima, is in full glory right now, its vibrant coral berries bursting from their seed pods amid the deep-green foliage. In summer, Iris foetidissima is easily overlooked. Its flowers are quite beautiful up close, with their delicate veining, but from a distance are a dull-leaden blue, or blue and beige-yellow, tempered and not inelegant, but perhaps too easily lost among the dagger-like foliage (which has a meaty smell when crushed, hence its name).  However, they save their best trick for last, with brilliant berries appearing in late autumn and persisting right through the winter and into early spring. The berries are deeply poisonous to humans, but not to birds, making this native plant a very valuable food source for wildlife. The birds won’t touch them till late in the season, when they have softened some. I notice mostly blackbirds devouring them. Stinking iris’s ability to thrive in extreme dry shade means it’s particularly useful for, say, jollying up the base of a leylandii hedge that you can’t get rid of, or for a dark, basement courtyard that only sees a sliver of sunlight. Its tolerant nature means it is also unfazed by the battering of seaside weather; you often see it growing in shady parts along cliff tops. What is less well known is the smattering of interesting cultivars and varieties of this species. These will take some hunting down, and may require a visit to a few rare plant fairs, but they are well worth the hunt. If you chance upon Iris foetidissima “Citrina”, a yellow-flowered form, jump on it. The flowers are a muted, yet joyous yellow with a deeper purplish bronze centre, and you still get those vibrant orange/red berries in the winter. Two further cultivars are selected for their leaf forms: “Variegata”, with its cream and green striped foliage (it reminds me of deckchairs, but I can see that in the right space it could work); and “Paul’s Gold”, which is yellow-leafed, particularly in spring with new growth. It also has a dwarf form, making it very useful for pots and containers. Finally, a few forms have different-coloured berries. There’s a golden-seeded one which appears naturally in the wild, and is often sold as either “Golden Seeded” or “Golden Gobbet”, but “FructuAlbo” is the one to lust over. I saw it once years ago and foolishly passed it by and, oh, do I covet it now. Instead of vibrant orange berries, it has polished white ones that sit inside the furry interior of the seed head like brilliant pearls – the only sort of jewellery I long for.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"It’s called stinking iris – but don’t let the name put you off, they brighten up a winter garden",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/08/stinking-iris-brighten-up-a-winter-garden
1/8/2022,"In the first moments of his presidency, Joe Biden called on Americans to set aside their deep divisions inflamed by a predecessor he intentionally ignored. He emphasized national unity and appealed to Americans to come together to “end this uncivil war”.  Nearly a year later, as a divided nation reflects on the first anniversary of the January 6 assault on the US Capitol, the uncivil war he sought to extinguish rages on, stronger than ever. In a searing speech on Thursday, Biden struck a different tone. He said he was “crystal clear” about the dangers facing the nation, and accused Donald Trump and his political allies of holding a “dagger at the throat of America, at American democracy.” In the course of the 21-minute speech, delivered from the US Capitol, Biden offered himself as a defender of democracy in the “battle for the soul of America.” “I will stand in this breach,” he promised. “I will defend this nation.” That moment of visceral speech-making marked a shift in strategy for how Biden has chosen to engage Trump – whose name he never uttered but instead taunted as the “defeated former president”. The decision to break his silence about Trump comes at a challenging moment in Biden’s presidency, with his Build Back Better agenda stalled, the Covid-19 pandemic resurgent and economic malaise widespread. It also reflected the reality that, far from being shunned, Trump remains the most powerful force in the Republican party and a potential rival to Biden in 2024. Confronting Trump was a calculated risk. Trump seized the opportunity to hurl all manner of insults and accusations at his successor, whose remarks he said were “very hurtful to many people”. But Biden’s speech was an acknowledgement that there were dangers in continuing to ignore Trump and what Biden called his “web of lies”. Recent polling suggests the vast majority of Republicans believe Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about the election fraud while a growing percentage of Americans are willing to tolerate political violence in some instances. Republican-controlled states are pursuing a raft of new voting restrictions, motivated in part by the doubts they sowed about the 2020 election results. At the same time, Republicans are passing laws that inject partisanship into the administration of elections and vote-counting while stripping power from and driving power from election officials who resisted pressure to throw out votes or overturn the elections in their state. “It was essential to be specific about the problem, and the source of the crisis,” said Julian Zelizer, a historian at Princeton University. “Otherwise the vague rhetoric, without agency, that we hear about polarization misses the way in which Trump and the GOP are the source of so much instability.” But he warned that a speech can only do so much. “Without holding people accountable for Jan 6 and the campaign against the 2020 election, and without real legislation to protecting voting rights and the electoral process, the ‘dagger at the throat of democracy’ won’t go away.” In his remarks, Biden argued that protecting voting rights was paramount to safeguarding American democracy. He sought to connect the dots between Trump’s promotion that the 2020 election was tainted by fraud and Republicans’ coordinated effort to “subvert” and undermine the electoral process in states where they control the levers of power. “Right now, in state after state, new laws are being written – not to protect the vote, but to deny it; not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it; not to strengthen or protect our democracy, but because the former president lost,” he said. Biden will follow up on the theme on Tuesday when he delivers another consequential speech on voting rights. In Atlanta, Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris will call for the passage of two voting rights bills that face daunting odds in the US Senate: the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The issue of voting rights has taken center stage after hopes of passing Biden’s sweeping domestic policy agenda were dashed by the opposition of senator Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat from West Virginia. So far Republican opposition has blocked passage of the legislation in the evenly divided chamber, where Democrats lack the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. Manchin again holds the keys on voting rights legislation, which he broadly supports. But his opposition to eliminating the filibuster has forced Democrats to pursue other avenues such as creating an exception in the rules for certain legislation. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said that he would schedule a vote on easing the filibuster rules not later than 17 January, which is Martin Luther King Day. Biden has faced immense pressure from civil rights leaders and voting rights advocates frustrated with his handling of the issue, seen as critical to the president’s legacy. Indeed, a coalition of Georgia-based voting rights groups warned Biden and Harris not to bother coming to the state unless they delivered a concrete plan to move forward, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters this week that Biden planed to stress the “urgent need to pass legislation to protect the constitutional right to vote and the integrity of our elections”. Spencer Overton, an election law expert and the president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, hopes Biden will use his bully pulpit to explain why passing federal voting rights legislation is so essential to combatting the pernicious lies and conspiracies undermining faith in the nation’s system of government. “Those lies have real consequences,” said. “Sometimes they’re graphic, as we saw a year ago on 6 January, but sometimes they silently erode democracy by preventing average citizens from participating in our democracy, and exercising their freedom to vote.” “This is the most important legislation in Congress now,” he added. “There’s just no benefit in waiting. The moment is now.”",News/US news,Strategy shift: Biden confronts Trump head on after year of silent treatment,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/08/joe-biden-donald-trump-president-strategy
1/8/2022,"Garlic noodles, french fries loaded with steak and shrimp, crab legs the length of an adult’s forearm – a brief scroll through the popular Instagram account of Bayareafoodz is enough to put you in a digital food coma. In a region known as one of America’s culinary capitals and a playground for Instagram foodies, Darion Frazier’s page stands out. He amassed more than 126k followers not with slickly produced videos at the hippest restaurants but with homages to the taquerias, greasy spoons, and small soul food joints.  “I live for wear and tear on furniture and menus at mom and pop restaurants. That tells you that the food is good as hell,” said Darion Frazier, the page’s owner, of the spots that hold a special place in his heart. His playful personality and enticing images have drawn thousands who come to see Frazier eat, sometimes while donning a black Versace robe, and letting his followers know whether a dish is “bussin’” (really good) or a letdown. Now, Frazier is expanding his dedication to small, local eateries with a food delivery service, Plate Pick, that’ll help home chefs and independent restaurants reach customers. Frazier says the site, which charges restaurants a 5% commission, is meant to be a viable alternative at a time when many restaurants are struggling with the costs of operating on platforms like Doordash, GrubHub and UberEats, which take a cut of 20% or more. Plate Pick also offers resources for home chefs to get legal services and marketing help.The Oakland native spoke with the Guardian about his hopes for the new venture, the challenges of being a Black influencer, and why he wants to be a positive force in the San Francisco Bay area food scene and wider community. Frazier, 29, first encountered the Bay Area’s rich food scene in the homes of friends. He grew up in a low-income apartment complex in west Oakland and says that sleepovers and playdates exposed him to new smells, tastes, and cultures. “We all were living in the same poverty, but at the end of the day, everybody is going home to a different dish,” Frazier recalled. “I would spend the night at my Filipino friend’s house and eat adobo, fish and lumpia. Or I’d be at my African friend’s house another night, and we’ll be eating fufu.” This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. Travelling to France, Mexico and Thailand in his early adulthood also helped him appreciate the Bay Area’s food scene. “We’ve got some of the best tacos on earth, and then you can go to another place and get the best burgers you ever had in your life. You can get Chinese food, Indian food, Moroccan food, jollof rice,” Frazier says. “The Bay Area has something special.” With this in mind, Frazier launched Bayareafoodz in late 2014 to shine a light on the mom and pop businesses that have fed residents for decades and were losing business due to gentrification. “Spots that have been around for multiple years that locals know about don’t have their regulars any more, so I wanted to help.” Barring the occasional selfie, Frazier rarely showed his face until he was two years deep into Bayareafoodz. But since he’s become more front-facing, the page has grown into a place where people go to hear Frazier’s unfiltered opinion. “My personality is the secret weapon,” he says. Toriano Gordon, the chef behind Vegan Mob, an always-busy Oakland restaurant that serves plant-based barbecue, soul food and Creole dishes, agrees that authenticity is a central component of Frazier’s appeal. “He ain’t trying too hard and that’s why he is doing so well. His posts are always entertaining, but you can tell it’s the real him,” says Gordon. “He’s a guide to Bay Area food, instead of going to Yelp, you’ll have better luck with Bayareafoodz.”Gordon was familiar with Frazier’s page by way of the Bay’s larger food scene and the pair met in late-2019, shortly after Gordon opened Vegan Mob’s brick and mortar location in Oakland. Before they began a professional relationship Frazier would post videos in front of the location and promote new menu offerings. Then once they got a chance to talk, Gordon and Frazier found common ground in their love of food and dedication to lifting up and supporting others as they climbed the ladder of success. “I’m big on unity, it’s imperative to support each other,” Gordon adds. “I may inspire him but he inspires me too, what he’s doing is innovative and special.” This article includes content provided by Instagram.

That success has built slowly over the last few years. At first, Frazier says he never saw the page as a way to make a living. But as its popularity grew, a $3,000 offer for his page, combined with restaurant owners telling him about the sales boosts that came immediately after a post, caused him to reconsider. Frazier chose not to sell the page and in 2017 began charging for food reviews. His first paid restaurant visit was for $25 at a San Francisco deli. Now he charges up to $700 for a review, and generates income from sponsored posts from food and beverage companies and Facebook advertisements. And recently, he decided to quit his day job at a Kaiser pharmacy to focus on his burgeoning food businesses. “I realized that if I built Bayareafoodz with a portion of this time, I figure I should go all in on something I enjoy doing,” he said. But he says there have been plenty of challenges along the way, especially as a Black creator on Instagram, which Frazier and others have said can pose barriers to their work. In recent years Black social media influencers on Instagram, TikTok and other platforms have waged strikes and digital campaigns to call out pay disparities and alleged limitations that silos their content based on their race and stifles their exposure.During the protests and racial reckoning of the summer of 2020, Instagram said they would examine potential racial biases in the algorithms they use, but there’s been little news about progress since. “Algorithms can guess the race of users and when they start to associate it with Black content they might put it in a corner,” said Kalinda Ukanwa, assistant professor of marketing at the University of Southern California. “There’s an assumption their content won’t have a broader appeal which creates an issue with monetization because they’re not getting that exposure.” Frazier says he is experiencing this phenomenon first-hand. “I’m the only Black foodie that I know of in Oakland and I worked really hard, but these algorithms can make it difficult to grow a brand,” he says, “but I have to roll with it.” With his next venture, Plate Pick, Frazier is looking to leverage his social media fame to support home chefs in Alameda county. The county recently established a program that allows people to run a business from their kitchens, after California made these types of operations legal in 2018. Frazier became the co-owner of the business in 2021 alongside tech CEO Andrew Fede. In addition to bringing Bay Area restaurants such as Vegan Mob to the website, Frazier and his team organize “legal nights” with staff from the county health department and attorneys who can help people get the permits and certification they need to sell food from home. He hopes the business can succeed without charging home chefs the exorbitant rate taken by other delivery companies. “I want to make sure we do the best that we can to help everybody in our community,” Frazier says. “We’re here to say, ‘You can do this! But be legal.’” Even with his business goals for the Instagram page and delivery service, Frazier says his ultimate motivation is to be a positive influence in the Bay Area and a role model, especially for young and impressionable residents. Aside from his food work, he’s organized scavenger hunts that drum up business for local restaurants and is increasingly speaking out on local issues such as gun violence. “There are plenty of talented people in the Bay, especially young African American men and women. But the youth only see where the light shines and sometimes it’s on things that aren’t fully positive like guns, drugs, and alcohol,” Frazier says. “I wanna let people know that you can be a designer, you can be an author, you can be a photographer, and still be popping.”",Lifestyle/Food,The Black foodie celebrating the Bay Area’s hidden gems: ‘our food scene is special’,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/08/bayareafoodz-oakland-plate-pick-food-scene
1/8/2022,"You will notice the slight lengthening of the days even now, and the plants and birds certainly sense it: it’s not unusual to see buff-tailed bumblebees out and about on a mild January day. Snowdrops are flowering, green shoots are pushing up through the earth, catkins are unfurling and the garden is grinding back into life.  Key jobPlanning. This is the time to sit down with your seed catalogues and dream of the crops and flowers you want to grow in the year ahead. Do you want armfuls of cornflowers, cosmos and zinnias? Juicy beefsteak tomatoes and crunchy mangetout? Time to put aside past failures and dream big. In the kitchen and flower gardensBuy and chit potatoes on a frost-free windowsill. Place forcers over rhubarb plants. Plant fruit trees – apples, pears, quinces and medlars – and prune existing ones. Sow sweet peas if you haven’t already. Plant roses when the ground is frost-free.Don’t forget …Chop, roast and eat up your winter squashes, perhaps sprinkled with crumbled feta, chopped mint and a squeeze of lime – there is not much to harvest in the garden now, so it’s time to get through your stored produce. Falling on 1-2 February, the ancient Celtic celebration of Imbolc is a fire festival, associated with seeds and new life. The ancients felt an urge to get sowing, but resist – for now. Sowing too early leads to rotten seeds and disappointment; only aubergines and chillies will appreciate such an early start. Don’t let the odd mild day and spring-like feeling tempt you. Key jobPreparation. Use this month to get yourself ready for sowing time. Wash old seed trays or buy new, and buy compost. Make neat piles and be ready to leap into action. Weed veg beds and cover with black or clear polythene to help the sun warm the soil. In the kitchen and flower gardensSow chilli and aubergine seeds indoors, ideally in a heated propagator. Sow broad beans and hardy peas in pots in a sheltered spot outside or in a greenhouse. Lift, split and transplant large clumps of woodland bulbs such as snowdrops, bluebells and winter aconites, to propagate them. Order dahlia tubers. Plant lilies in pots. Don’t forget …Buy British-grown flowers for Valentine’s Day to support local businesses and reduce the number of flowers being flown in from around the world. Try Cornish Blooms and the Real Flower Company. According to lore, if March comes in like a lion, it goes out like a lamb, which implies rather more predictable weather than we often get in March. Generally, winter starts to relent now. Daffodils pop up, and there is a soft haze of lime green over trees and hedgerows. Key jobFinally, this month we can begin to sow in earnest. Pace yourself, sowing a couple of crops every few days, and don’t over sow. The soil is still cold, so sow in containers or a greenhouse for planting out later. In the kitchen and flower gardensSow brussels sprouts, cabbages, celery, Florence fennel, lettuce, sprouting broccoli, peas, spinach, Swiss chard, carrots, turnips, beetroot and radishes – . Sow tender crops – tomatoes, cucumbers, winter squash, aubergines – indoors, ideally in a heated propagator, midway through the month. This is the perfect time to start an asparagus bed, using crowns. Other perennials will do well planted now, including rhubarb, strawberries and artichokes. Don’t forget …Wild garlic is up, and perfectly young and tender, and you’ll find it – by nose – in old woods. Pick bags of it and whiz up with toasted hazelnuts, hard goat’s cheese and olive oil to make a woodland pesto. Frosts are still highly likely and nights are still cold. Good Friday (15 April) is the traditional day for planting out potatoes; 23 April, St George’s Day, heralds the start of the asparagus season. Key jobYou can start sowing direct this month, but protect new plants and seedlings with cloches. Harden plants off gradually when moving them from indoors to out: a few hours outside, then back in and so on. In the kitchen and flower gardensPlant out potatoes in trenches or in pots. Under cover, sow: french beans, runner beans, cabbages, cauliflowers, courgettes, cucumbers, Florence fennel, kale, winter squash and sweetcorn. Sow direct: lettuces, peas, rocket, summer purslane, corn salad, spinach, Swiss chard, carrots, beetroot, parsnip, turnip, leeks and spring onions. Harvest asparagus. Pot up dahlia tubers and protect from frost and slugs. Sow half-hardies: snapdragon, zinnia, nicotiana, cleome, cosmos, tithonia, sunflowers. Plant out sweet peas with shrubby “pea sticks” or netting for them to scramble up. Don’t forget …Get out among the bluebell woods during their brief and glorious reign at the end of April. Check the National Trust for sites to visit (usually for a fee). All of the plants I have teetering on windowsills can finally go into the ground. But beware that the “ice saints” (Saints Mamertus, Pancras and Servatius), whose feast days fall on 11, 12 and 13 May respectively – can herald a cold snap that can bring the final frosts of spring. The end of May will see a frenzy of planting out. Key jobsPlanting out, watering and feeding. In the kitchen and flower gardensPot chillies into their final pots. Sow coriander, chervil, dill and parsley direct into the ground under cloches. Sow basil in pots indoors. Earth up potatoes. Plant hanging baskets and window boxes with colourful bedding plants. Plant lilies and gladioli in pots. Pick bunches of fragrant lily of the valley to give to your loved ones on 1 May, which is the Fête du Muguet (lily of the valley day) in France. Water and feed. Don’t forget …Pick globe artichokes while they are still small and before their “choke” has formed. Peel away the harder dark green “petals” and pare off any leftover tough bits, then boil for 10 minutes or until a knife tip pierces them easily. Drain, quarter and eat with vinaigrette. Summer arrives and the work switches from manic sowing and planting out to leisurely maintenance, perhaps wandering around the garden on a warm evening with a watering can in one hand and a glass of wine in the other. Key jobsTending to veg, and enjoying its bounty. Enjoy the garden – you’ve set it up well for the rest of the year. In the kitchen and flower gardensPinch out the side shoots of tomatoes, tie them up, and start feeding every week. Pick salad: lettuce, peas, broad beans, artichokes, asparagus and sorrel are all at their best. Strawberries are abundant and it is time to make the first jam of the year. Pick roses early and plunge them up to their necks in water for a few hours before arranging in big bunches with alchemilla leaves and heads of cow parsley. Don’t forget …Traditionally at midsummer, doors were hung with birch, fennel, lilies and wildflowers, food was laid out for neighbours, and fires and lamps were lit at dusk to keep burning throughout the shortest night.

1/8/2022,"Acost of living catastrophe is what British families are facing in early 2022. The government has been understandably focused on Omicron but has woken up to this crisis, and is now discussing policy action to address it. But there is no magic bullet. What’s worse, this comes on the back of a decade of stagnant living standards. The big-picture driver of the cost of living crunch is rapidly rising inflation, which is already at 5.1% and forecast to hit a 30-year high of more than 6% this spring. Fast price rises mean pay packets were already shrinking in real terms late last year – for the third time in a decade. Prior to the financial crisis, real wages basically never fell. The fact that it’s now become almost normal says a lot about the weak growth of our economy, and explains why Britain has spent the past 10 years or more in an unprecedented living-standards disaster.  But there are specific features that will turn our current cost-of-living crunch into a cost of living catastrophe this April – rising taxes and soaring energy bills. Both are painful, but taxes at least have the merit of being borne by those with the broadest shoulders, while the £12.5bn of extra revenue from higher national insurance contributions is badly needed by the NHS. There are no merits to soaring energy bills, unless you’re reading this in Moscow. Rising gas prices mean that typical energy bills could increase by £700 or more when the energy price cap is lifted in April. And unlike tax rises, this squeeze will be felt most keenly by low-income families. If typical energy bills reach £2,000 a year, that would mean – according to the Resolution Foundation’s latest analysis – the poorest third of households spending at least 10% of family budgets on energy bills alone. This is comparable to what richer households spend on the likes of restaurants, hotels and holidays. The scale of this catastrophe is so huge, and so difficult for low-income families to cope with, the government will have to step in. Doing so isn’t easy. An unlikely coalition of Labour and Brexiteer Tory MPs want to cut VAT on energy bills. This would make some difference, cutting individual bills by about £100, at a collective cost of £2bn. But on its own that’s tiny compared with the average estimated bill surge of £750, and doesn’t target support at those needing it most. The top priority is support for lower-income families, unable to simply cut nonessential spending, or draw down on savings as energy bills rise. This support could be most simply given via the benefits system. But the government is reluctant to consider this option, having recently removed the £20 uplift to universal credit. The good news is that there is potentially another ready-made route to provide support: the warm homes discount (WHD). The bad news is that it’s an absolute stinker of a policy design-wise that will require major surgery to make it fit for purpose. The first step to improving it would be to increase eligibility from poorer pensioners and some low-income working families to all poorer households. The payment will also need to be automatic to ensure the help gets through. Second, the normal payment of £140 might be enough for a normal winter, but won’t wash when bills surge by 50%. Third, WHD currently funds help for some people by increasing everyone else’s energy bills. But for obvious reasons higher bills aren’t exactly what we need today – so the taxpayer would have to pick up the tab. Collectively paying higher taxes tomorrow for lower bills today is the right answer to such a big price spike for an essential good. How much might all this cost? A £300 one-off payment to all 8.5 million low-income households would cost up to £2.5bn. A large amount, but the minimum we’re going to need to mitigate rising energy bills. And once we’re through this crisis we mustn’t forget the bigger picture – the need to tackle our failing energy sector, poorly insulated housing and reliance on fossil fuels. The surge in Omicron cases means the equally staggering rise in energy prices has taken a while to get debated in Westminster. We’ve now got a matter of weeks to turn that talking into something more useful for households seeing their budgets squeezed: action.

1/8/2022,"Comparing different sides from two wildly different eras, nearly 40 years apart and straddling the shift from amateurism to professionalism, is never easy. Yet Ian Smith, the captain of Leicester Tigers for the 1983-84 season that began with 16 straight wins – a record Steve Borthwick’s side will hope to match on Sunday – sums it up well. “When we played we wanted to win every game,” says Smith, who made 331 appearances for Leicester. “When they play now they have to win every game because if they don’t it’s P45.”  Smith is better placed to pass judgment on the two sides than most, having been part of the Leicester fabric for the best part of 30 years as a player and coach – as he says: “I’ve had more job titles than you could poke a stick at.” His son, Matt, made 228 appearances for Leicester and is now one of Borthwick’s assistants, and Smith Sr still pops along to cast his eye over training every now and then. There is another obvious difference for Smith: “We thought we were cosmopolitan because Les Cusworth came from Yorkshire and Dusty Hare from Nottingham.” But there are traits of Borthwick’s side that remind him of yesteryear. The chairman, Peter Tom, recently remarked to Smith that the current crop were closing in on his record but no one would be happier to see it matched against Wasps – the side who snapped the 1983-84 run. That season was Smith’s first as captain and Graham Willars’ as coach. Smith was part of a formidable back row featuring John Wells and a 20-year-old Dean Richards, who “could turn the game in the blink of an eye. He had this uncanny knack, he was never the quickest man but he always seemed to be where the ball was. I’d say to him: ‘Have you worked out some secret tunnels under the pitch?!?’” And there was star quality littered throughout the backline. At scrum-half was Nick Youngs – father of Tom and Ben – Cusworth was at fly-half, Clive Woodward and Paul Dodge occupied the midfield while Hare was point after point from full-back and a young Rory Underwood was breaking through on the wing. Two things immediately spring to mind when Smith casts his mind back. First was how the 16-match winning run included 41-3 and 29-24 victories over Cardiff and Swansea respectively at a time when “you never beat the Welsh, just scored more points than them”. The other was a rare clanger from Woodward in a cup final. “It became infamous because Clive Woodward did what was commonly referred to as his Devon Loch – he was clear to score, nobody near him and he fell over. It would have won the game.” Woodward was, however, one of six Leicester players – with Youngs, Dodge, Cusworth, Hare and the national captain, Peter Wheeler – who that November beat the All Blacks twice in the space of 10 days, once with the Midlands and again with England, in a further measure of the quality in the Tigers ranks at the time. “I don’t think those boys have ever been given the credit they deserve for those memorable victories,” says Smith. “We had some real characters in the team. Peter Wheeler was a big part of England’s grand slam success in 1980 with Paul, which was the year of our centenary tour in 1980 to Australia and Fiji. All the work that Chalkie [White, coach from 1968-83] had done laid a massive foundation.” It soon becomes clear that above anything else, Smith most values the friendships made during that time, the bonds forged and though the professionalism has changed much about the club, under Borthwick he sees similarities with the past. “I see the way the boys have responded to the new regime,” adds Smith. “I’ve been in a few times and watched a few sessions and seen what they’re trying to achieve. It is amazing that these players have responded in such a way. People come and go, and it’s a professional game and people are paid a lot of money. I thought Matt would be the last one-club man but we’ve still got Ben Youngs and Tom Youngs and Dan Cole who are contemporaries of Matt, they hopefully will finish as one-club men and that is an absolute rarity in the current game. “Look at the Saracens game, look at the Bristol game, look at the five-point try against Newcastle. Those moments are only born out of, not being paid an extra few quid, but an inner strength and a friendship, and a desire to reach something Leicester haven’t been able to do for a while. “The hallmark of Leicester is being able to win without playing particularly well and that gives you a five-point start because the opposition are thinking: ‘Oh crikey, it’s Leicester.’ Throughout Tigers history that has been the case.” It will come as no surprise that Borthwick has given short shrift to any talk of records. He was part of Eddie Jones’s coaching staff when England equalled the international record of 18 straight wins – a streak that slowly but surely became an albatross around the necks of the players. Indeed, Jones has recalled how “a small part of me was glad the run was over” when it ended. For Smith, however, it could be just the start. “As I say to players now, the most important pages in history aren’t those that have been written, they are the ones you are going to write and I sincerely hope that these boys write themselves into the history books by breaking the record, doing well for the rest of the season, more of them getting international recognition and it continues long into the future. There’ll be no one cheering them on louder than me and hopefully they break the record and set one that will never be beaten.”",Sport/Sport,"Oh crikey, it’s Leicester: Tigers out to match their own winning streak",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/08/oh-crikey-its-leicester-tigers-out-to-match-their-own-winning-streak
