1/22/2022," Despite the no-choral-singing strictures of lockdown, the National Youth Choir of Great Britain has inspired nine striking new pieces by their four rising-star composers, featured onthe NYCGB’s Young Composers 3 (NMC), director Ben Parry. In the sensuous, whispering Softly, the Welsh composer Derri Joseph Lewis explores the uneasy experience of coming out as LGBTQ+. Kristina Arakelyan has set Wordsworth’s I Wandered Lonely As a Cloud, the choral textures rich and glowing. Anna Disley-Simpson has made atmospheric settings of Sara Teasdale’s February Twilight and a poem by Rudyard Kipling. For Alex Ho, British Chinese and based in London, the racial harassment faced by the UK’s south-east and east Asian communities has prompted Hush, spiky, menacing and poetic.   “My ghost will haunt the tyrant”, blasts the mighty Cleopatra, exploding with anger and grief in Piangerò la sorte mia, one of her spectacular arias in Giulio Cesare in Egitto. It’s one of the many highlights in Handel: Enchantresses (Alpha Classics), the fourth joint venture between the crystalline-voiced French soprano Sandrine Piau and Jérôme Correas, director and harpsichordist, and his baroque group Les Paladins. Handel’s “enchantresses” include queens as well as sirens and sorceresses: Melissa (Amadigi), Almirena (Rinaldo), Alcina and Morgana (Alcina) are all here, their vocal fireworks and heartfelt outpourings interspersed with movements from Handel’s Concerto Grosso in G minor, Op 6 No 6, and the A minor, Op 6 No 4. The crown for aria of unmatched genius – each is a contender – goes to Alcina’s Ah! mio cor! With its sobbing inner parts, bass line sinking and throbbing, voice making leaps of anguish, this emotional marathon (nearly 12 minutes) is a turning point in the opera. The sorceress of the title at last learns what it is to feel love. Sizzling performances from all.  The Royal Opera House is offering streams of Gounod’s Faust (from 2019), starring Michael Fabiano, Erwin Schrott and Irina Lungu (£10 until 13 February), and Verdi’s Nabucco (current production; £16 until 19 February) starring Liudmyla Monastyrska.

1/22/2022,"Jonas Eidevall likes challenges so the Arsenal manager must be looking forward to Sunday’s task in hand. The WSL leaders have suffered a dramatic loss of form since December and face a Manchester City side that are on a six-game winning streak. The Swede, under pressure after a run of one win in five games, promised Arsenal were going “to bring everything” to the game at City’s Academy Stadium. “Playing matches against Manchester City really excites me,” said Eidevall. “It’s a great football team. I like challenges in football, I like playing against good teams.”  City are definitely a good team at the moment, having scored 25 goals in those six wins, conceding only three, and are clearly capable of damaging Arsenal’s title ambitions. The Gunners are still four points clear at the top of the table but second-placed Chelsea have a game in hand. Eidevall insisted his players are in good spirits, bolstered by the return of Lia Wälti and Lotte Wubben-Moy from injury and that he can give his trio of January signings – Stina Blackstenius, Laura Wienroither and Rafaelle Souza – their league debuts. “I wouldn’t say that I would experience any problem with the spirit,” Eidevall said of his squad. “We know what we need to do better, we know what we need to develop and I feel we’re all very committed to carrying on with that.” He pinpointed the attack as key to Arsenal finding form again, hoping that Tobin Heath and Vivianne Miedema can cause City problems. “We only got to see a glimpse of Tobin before she was injured. The way we played at home at Hoffenheim was our best performance [of the season] and she was a big part of that.” The USA international can contribute in both attack and defence, meaning better support for Miedema. “Viv is perfect with her movement” he explained. “She has real moments of high quality on the left. However, we are playing the ball towards her where there is no space or numerical superiority. On those occasions, we need a much better support structure.” The Dutch striker’s connection with the centre-back Leah Williamson may once again be tweaked: “Keep the combination play on with the full-backs but if it is not on, we might need her lower on the pitch for central overload.” Clearly Miedema’s movement is a focal point for both attack and defence, ensuring that Arsenal do not allow City’s most important players to flex their muscles. The high press on opposition defences from the Gunners attack evident during Joe Montemurro’s tenure is still alive and kicking. It will be an intriguing game, not least so because City’s return to form after a poor start to the season. They are playing at home for the first time in two months and there is a confidence about returning to the Academy Stadium. Leading their charge is Georgia Stanway, who has scored in five consecutive league games and is staking her claim for a place in the starting XI. The City manager, Gareth Taylor, said: “We want to get her up as high as possible. We’ve seen her enthusiasm and tenacity on the pitch and we’ll need it come Sunday. “We’re high on confidence at the moment, but we understand the game isn’t won on confidence alone. We want to dominate as much as we can and that comes down to small details.” Those small details could be anything from playing Stanway further up, the return of Lucy Bronze from injury, or even a change in Arsenal’s attacking methods – all of which Taylor says is likely to make it a “tight game”. City are without their first-choice keeper, Ellie Roebuck, with Karima Benameur set to play. Taylor, however, is confident his team will benefit from having Bronze – and Steph Houghton – return and that his defence will be up for the challenge. “They give you big presence on the pitch, I think big confidence as well – they are big-game players and we’ve seen that,” he said. “Those players being involved helps the rest of the team. We have a bit more support now in a number of areas.”",Sport/Football,Jonas Eidevall eager for Manchester City game despite Arsenal’s poor WSL form,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/22/jonas-eidevall-eager-for-manchester-city-game-despite-arsenals-poor-wsl-form
1/22/2022,"The US embassy in Ukraine has requested the evacuation of all non-essential staff amid increasing fears of an imminent Russian invasion and the arrival overnight of arms deliveries promised by President Joe Biden, according to a CNN report. US evacuations are likely to start “as early as next week”, the US cable news network said, citing a source close to the Ukrainian government. It marks the embassy’s shift in focus towards “helping Ukraine bolster its defences in the face of growing Russian aggression”.  The embassy in Kyiv also said on Twitter that the first batch of fresh US assistance had arrived in Ukraine, which includes weaponry described as “200,000 pounds of lethal aid, including ammunition for the frontline defenders of Ukraine.” It follows Biden’s assertion on Wednesday in a White House address that he now expected the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to “move in” and invade Ukraine, in an act that would mean large-scale war returning to continental Europe for the first time in a generation. “My guess is he will move in,” Biden said in response to questions about whether an invasion was coming. “He has to do something.” The first shipment of assistance recently directed by President Biden to Ukraine arrived in Ukraine tonight. This shipment includes close to200,000 pounds of lethal aid, including ammunition for the front line defenders of Ukraine. [1/2] pic.twitter.com/YeYanK0Px6 The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, held talks with Russian diplomats in Switzerland on Friday in an attempt to avert conflict, with Blinken and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, striking a conciliatory tone and the diplomatic process ongoing. “We didn’t expect any breakthroughs to happen today,” Blinken said after the meeting. “But I believe we are now on a clearer path in terms of understanding each other’s concerns.” Britain and Russia’s defence ministers will meet after Russia’s Sergei Shoigu accepted an invitation from the UK’s Ben Wallace to discuss mutual security. They will meet in Moscow. “The secretary of state has been clear that he will explore all avenues to achieve stability and a resolution to the Ukraine crisis. We are in communication with the Russian government,” a senior UK defence source told PA Media. It comes after Downing Street warned Russia would be “punished” if the country pushes ahead with any “destabilising action” in Ukraine, as an estimated 100,000 Russian troops sit on the borders of Ukraine. No 10 said if Putin launched an offensive there would be a “package of sweeping measures” launched by western allies against the Kremlin. But Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, demanded advance action, saying the UK should be ready to financially support Ukraine so it is prepared for an invasion. “I’d like to see all of us going further, because one of the things that’s delaying the ability of the Ukrainian people to mobilise their armed forces to meet any such invasion is, that has a huge effect on any country’s economy,” Tugendhat told the BBC. “If you take hundreds of thousands of people out of the workforce in order to stand guard they will have a real impact on jobs and lives in other sectors.” The shipment - and $2.7 billion USD since 2014 - demonstrates U.S. commitment to helping Ukraine bolster its defenses in the face of growing Russian aggression. 🇺🇸🇺🇦 #partnershipstrong [2/2] pic.twitter.com/scPFWM3we7 Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the commons defence committee, echoed concerns of a nearing military antagonism and said he believed a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be “imminent”. “Putin is taking full advantage of a weakened west. We are looking risk-averse, somewhat timid,” he told the BBC. “Putin’s ultimatum demanding Nato push back, of course that was dismissed but that’s given him the pretext to say that there is an aggressor and that he must act.” “We see these combat-ready troop formations. He has actually boxed himself into a corner because so much effort has been put into this,” Ellwood added. “He also recognises that he will never again be as strong as this to take advantage of the west’s weakness. I suspect that an invasion is now imminent.”",News/World news,US embassy in Ukraine ‘requests staff evacuation’ amid war fears,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/us-embassy-in-ukraine-requests-staff-evacuation-amid-war-fears
