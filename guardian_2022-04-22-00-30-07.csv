4/22/2022,"Rebekah Vardy attempted to sell a story about the arrest of footballer Danny Drinkwater to the Sun newspaper – only to be turned down because the tabloid had already been leaked the story by an individual at the police station, the high court has heard. The claim emerged as part of Vardy’s ongoing “Wagatha Christie” libel battle against fellow footballer’s wife Coleen Rooney, who publicly accused Vardy of leaking her private information to the tabloid. Drinkwater, a former teammate of Vardy’s husband, Jamie Vardy, at Leicester City, was arrested for drink-driving after crashing his Range Rover in early 2019. Before the incident became public Vardy was already sending WhatsApp messages to her agent Caroline Watt to tell her what had happened and suggesting they sell the story. Vardy told her agent: “Story … Danny Drinkwater arrested […] Crashed his car drunk with 2 girls in it … both in hospital one with broken ribs x” After clarifying a few details about the car and the location, Vardy added: “I want paying for this x”. Within two minutes Watt said she had sent the story to Sun journalist Andy Halls, who she said “replied immediately” that the tabloid already knew because “someone leaked it from police station”. Drinkwater was later banned from driving for almost two years. The disclosure is the latest in a series of messages that have been made public as part of the ongoing legal case, which is due to go a week-long trial a the start of May. Rooney, the wife of former England footballer Wayne Rooney, argues that Vardy systematically leaked information to the Sun and had extensive contact with its journalists. The libel case will hinge on whether Rooney can prove that it was Vardy who was personally responsible for leaking any stories from her private Instagram to the Sun. In a ruling on Thursday, Mrs Justice Steyn handed a partial victory to Vardy’s legal team, ordering the removal of certain elements of Rooney’s evidence. Among the claims deleted from Rooney’s witness statement was a section which alleged Vardy “was also actively participating in leaking private information about other individuals to the Sun”. The judge also turned down a request by Rooney’s lawyers to search the phones of a number of Sun journalists for potential communications with Vardy and Watt. She branded this a “fishing expedition” but made an exception for details of messages with Halls, who was involved in some of the disputed stories. The court heard that in 2019 Halls declared that Vardy “has never provided any story or information to me”. WhatsApp messages disclosed as part of the legal filings suggest Vardy and her agent Caroline Watt regularly discussed journalists at the Sun. At one point Vardy says she is concerned that Rooney has blocked her on Instagram after stories appeared in the media. In response, the agent says “I wouldn’t tell anyone but the Sun” and Rooney can’t “fucking prove anything though and if she wants to think that then fuck her.” Watt said she had been in touch with the Halls about the incident: “I messaged him and he said absolutely not and he never would say what his source was”. In November 2018 Watt also told Vardy to look out for Sun celebrity journalist Amy Brookbanks at an event and “make a point of saying hello” because the reporter “always writes nice stories, does whatever I ask her and gets stories changed that she hasn’t even written”. Vardy no longer intends to call Watt as a witness at the trial, saying the agent is suffering from ill health. Despite this, Watt has still received substantial attention after it was disclosed in a pre-trial hearing that she accidentally dropped her phone in the North Sea after a request was made to search it. Vardy has also struggled to access her own WhatsApp messages after her IT expert lost the password to her backup files.",News/UK news,"Rebekah Vardy’s bid to sell story about drink-driving player failed, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/21/rebekah-vardy-coleen-rooney-wagatha-christie-libel-drink-driving-player-story

4/22/2022,"Below is a list of Conservative MPs who are currently calling publicly for Boris Johnson to step down. Some others have demanded this, but subsequently said the Ukraine war meant it was not the right time for such an action. In a Commons speech on Tuesday, the former Brexit minister said that while he had wanted to forgive Johnson for breaking Covid rules, the prime minister’s contrition “only lasted as long as it took to get out of the headmaster’s study”. Baker ended: “The prime minister now should be long gone … Really, the prime minister should just know the gig’s up.” Also speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, the former chief whip said Johnson had not been straightforward about his actions and was now asking Tory MPs “to defend what I think is indefensible”. He added: “I am very sorry to have to say this, but I no longer think he is worthy of the great office he holds.” Harper said he had submitted a letter of no confidence. After Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were fined for breaching lockdown rules, the Calder Valley MP said both should “do the right thing and resign”. He told a Facebook session with constituents: “You can’t set the law of the lands and then break them as they have.” The Amber Valley MP also called for Johnson and Sunak to resign after they were fined, and said he had submitted a no confidence letter for the prime minister. “I don’t think the prime minister can survive or should survive, breaking the rules he put in place and was on TV every few nights reminding us all that we should observe,” Mills said. “We have to have higher standards than that of people at the top. He’s been fined, I don’t think his position is tenable.” A consistent critic of Johnson, the former minister wrote to a constituent last week to say she had submitted a no confidence letter: “I have already been very clear that I believe the PM’s conduct fell far short of what my constituents have every right to expect. I do not need to write a letter of no confidence to the chair of the 1922 Committee, mine was in a very long time ago.” The veteran South West Devon MP was among a series of backbenchers who called for Johnson to go in February. Writing on social media, Streeter said he had submitted a no confidence letter: “I cannot reconcile the pain and sacrifice of the vast majority of the British public during lockdown with the attitude and activities of those working in Downing Street.” The Totnes and South Devon MP also said in February that he had sent a no confidence letter, tweeting: “At this time I can no longer support the PM. His actions and mistruths are overshadowing the extraordinary work of so many excellent ministers.” Speaking on the same day as Mangnall, the chair of the Commons defence committee said he had written a letter, telling Sky News: “I believe it’s time for the prime minister to take a grip of this; he himself should call a vote of confidence rather than waiting for the inevitable 54 letters to be eventually submitted.” The long-serving Waveney MP was another to make his views known in February: “I have never taken such action before and had hoped that I would not be put in such an invidious position. Whilst I am conscious that others will disagree with me, I believe that this is in the best interests of the country, the government and the Conservative party.” He said his letter remained on the table, but that after the war was over would be a better time to raise the question of Mr Johnson’s leadership. The Newcastle-under-Lyme MP confirmed he had submitted a letter a few days after challenging Johnson during a Commons debate on the interim Sue Gray report on Downing Street parties.

4/22/2022,"Russian troops have used a number of weapons widely banned across the world, which have killed hundreds of civilians in the Ukrainian region of Kyiv, according to research by the Guardian. Evidence collected during a visit to Bucha, Hostomel and Borodianka, where Russian occupiers have been accused of atrocities against residents, showed that Russian troops had used cluster munitions, cluster bombs and extremely powerful unguided bombs in populated areas, which have destroyed at least eight civilian buildings. Bellingcat, a nonprofit online journalism collective dedicated to war crime investigations, which has reviewed some of the pictures collected by the Guardian, confirmed the presence of tail fins of RBK-500 cluster bombs with PTAB-1M submunitions and cluster rocket, launched by BM-30 Smerch. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and has said Ukrainian and western allegations of war crimes are concocted. However, Russia’s withdrawal from the areas of the Kyiv region that it occupied until early April has revealed signs of cluster munitions on the wreckage of cars, streets, civilian buildings and dead bodies, too. Cluster munitions, banned by most of the world under a 2008 treaty called the Convention on Cluster Munitions, were unleashed in areas where there were no military personnel and no military infrastructure. Cluster bombs are designed to release dozens of smaller bombs, called submunitions, over a wide area, but the smaller munitions do not always explode, posing a future risk to civilians. The bombs were banned under international law by the 2008 treaty, which has been signed by more than 100 countries – although not Russia or Ukraine. According to the New York Times, Ukrainian troops used a cluster munition rocket in early March in Husarivka, a village in the east of the country that they were trying to retake. The wrecks of dozens of cars in Bucha and Borodianka, seen and photographed by the Guardian and reviewed by experts, show the characteristic holes caused by submunitions from cluster bombs used by the Russian military. The use of cluster bombs and cluster munitions has also been widely reported in other areas of Ukraine. On 4 April, as a team from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) entered an oncology hospital in Mykolaiv, south-east Ukraine, several explosions took place in close proximity to the staff. “No large crater was visible,” reads a statement from MSF. “In the wake of the explosions, our team saw numerous small holes in the ground, scattered over a large area. These elements could be consistent with the use of cluster bombs.” The Guardian found a Russian cluster rocket used to prop cluster munitions near a farm village in Hostomel and allegedly launched by a BM-30 Smerch. Much of this evidence on the use of these types of internationally banned weapons has been collected by Ukrainian prosecutors and will soon be forwarded to the international criminal court (ICC), which has launched an investigation into possible war crimes, or crimes against humanity, in Ukraine. “Russia is applying forbidden means and methods of war – in particular, it is using prohibited ammunition, cluster bombs and cluster artillery ammunition,” Oleh Tkalenko, the Kyiv region’s deputy head prosecutor, told the Guardian. “In the town of Borodianka, during its occupation, Smerch system cluster ammunition was used, which is forbidden. Apart from that, the civil objects were bombed by FAB-250 bombs (this information was provided by the specialists). Eight buildings were destroyed.” FAB-250 is a very inaccurate, Soviet-designed, 250kg airdropped bomb, largely employed by the Soviet Union in its war in Afghanistan and by the Russian Federation in Syria. The FAB-250 descend in freefall from planes and have been exclusively designed to hit military targets, such as destroying enemy-fortified facilities, surface fortifications, like depots storing certain equipment, or bunkers. Although Russia says it is trying to destroy military targets, evidence collected or reviewed by the Guardian and independently verified by weapons experts shows these bombs were dropped on residential buildings and civilian infrastructures. A residential building in Borodianka that housed hundreds of civilians was hit by a FAB-250 and was gutted and split in two pieces. Most residents died. “You don’t have to be an arms expert to understand that Russia ignored the rules of war in Bucha,” Bucha’s mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, told the Guardian. “Bucha was turned into a Chechen safari, where they used landmines against civilians.” An official worker in the prosecutor’s office in Kyiv confirmed: “There are many cases in Bucha and Irpin where they leave the mines in private homes.” Tkalenko said forensic doctors were analysing every single body found in mass graves, on streets, in basements or buried in rubble, and that fragments of cluster bombs and cluster munitions had been found. “Small objects are found in bodies,” Tkalenko said. “So, the process is organised like this: the bodies are dug out, the forensics are appointed and the experts are working on it. I can’t give any more precise information, because thousands of reports are being written, it is all being collected and will be classified. Every kind of ammunition will be classified. We are preparing for [a future war crimes investigation at] The Hague. So, this work is done by two specialists: one finds the objects, another takes them out and appoints the expertise. The task of a prosecutor is to make sure that the law is obeyed.” “What I can tell you is that in 20 years of my career, I have never seen such horrors, as I have seen since 24 February up until now, and never have I seen such horrific events,” Tkalenko added. “War, it is very scary. That’s all.’’ Additional reporting by Dan Sabbagh",News/World news,"Russia using cluster bombs to kill Ukrainian civilians, pictures suggest",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/russia-using-banned-weapons-to-kill-ukrainian-civilians-pictures-suggest
4/22/2022,"In the days after the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell, the two top Republican leaders in Congress, privately told associates that they believed Donald Trump should be held responsible for the attack. A new report from the New York Times, the reporting for which comes from a forthcoming book by reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns called This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America’s Future, details private conversations that McCarthy and McConnell had with colleagues revealing the extent of their anger toward Trump. “I’ve had it with this guy,” McCarthy reportedly told a group of Republicans in the immediate aftermath of the attack. The leaders floated the idea of impeachment with their colleagues, though both men ultimately voted against holding Trump responsible in Democratic-led impeachment proceedings. On a phone call with several top House Republicans, McCarthy allegedly said that Trump had been “atrocious and totally wrong” and blamed him for “inciting people”. He inquired about invoking the 25th amendment, which involves the removal of a president from office. McCarthy, the book reports, went on to tell colleagues that his plan was to tell Trump to resign. “What he did is unacceptable. Nobody can defend it and nobody should defend it,” he said. Other top Republicans chimed in supporting the idea of moving away from Trump, including Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who said that the party should think of a “post-Trump Republican House” and Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who brought up the possibility of censuring the president. Scalise and Emmer voted against Trump’s impeachment. McCarthy also spoke of his wish that the big tech companies would de-platform Republican lawmakers, as Twitter and Facebook did with Trump following the insurrection, who had also played a role in stoking the insurrection. “We can’t put up with that,” McCarthy said. “Can’t they take their Twitter accounts away, too?” A spokesperson for McCarthy told the New York Times that McCarthy “never said that particular members should be removed from Twitter”. It appears that McCarthy and other top Republicans paid more heed to warnings that their Republican base would retaliate if House members publicly denounced Trump. Bill Johnson, a congressman from Ohio, told McCarthy that his voters would “go ballistic” if they criticized Trump. “I’m just telling you that that’s the kind of thing that we’re dealing with, with our base,” Johnson reportedly said. In a statement to the New York Times, a spokesperson for McCarthy said that he “never said he’d call Trump to say he should resign”. Meanwhile, McConnell met with two longtime advisers over lunch in Kentucky on 11 January, five days after the insurrection. He spoke to the men about the upcoming impeachment proceedings led by the Democrats. “The Democrats are going to take care of the son of a bitch for us,” McConnell said. “If this isn’t impeachable, I don’t know what is.” Several senior Republican senators believed that McConnell was leaning toward impeachment once the proceedings would get to the Senate. The Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, told associates that he believed McConnell’s frustration with Trump could push him toward impeachment, but said “I don’t trust him, and I would not count on it.” While McCarthy and McConnell acknowledged Trump’s responsibility in the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, both men quickly went back to publicly supporting Trump. In April 2021, McCarthy told Fox News that Trump was unaware that the attack was happening until McCarthy broke the news to him. “He didn’t see it, but he ended the call … telling me he’ll put something out to make sure to stop this.” As the special House panel investigating the attack prepares to hold public hearings next month, McCarthy has denounced the committee’s investigation, refusing to cooperate with its inquiry on conversations the leader had with Trump in the days after the attack. McConnell, meanwhile, has taken a more supportive stance of the committee, saying in December that he believes their investigation is “something the public needs to know”. Still, the Senate minority leader said he would “absolutely” support Trump if he was the Republican presidential nominee in 2024.",News/US news,"Top Republicans held ‘atrocious’ Trump responsible for Capitol attack, book says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/21/republicans-donald-trump-capitol-attack-book
4/22/2022,"At my first gig back after 18 months of lockdowns, I greeted old irritations like a lost lover returning from sea. Ahh, £6 for pint of lager that will haunt my guts tomorrow. How I missed you, being crammed in butt to butt with strangers. Is there any sound sweeter than a pair of mates chatting through every song? No, there is not! Moreover, I’ve been to shows where the communal sense of awe at live music seems stronger than ever: Alabaster DePlume at Le Guess Who? festival in November, closing the day at 7pm after the Dutch government brought in a surprise Covid curfew and holding the room in the palm of his hand; Self Esteem at Kentish Town Forum in March, nourishing a palpably deep hunger in her faithful; Sparks taking a hilarious and profound victory lap at the Roundhouse last weekend. (Theatre critics have reported a similarly heightened sense of intensity.) In time, though, I’ve also turned up late, talked and texted throughout other post-pandemic gigs. While the novelty of seeing shows again may quickly wear off, some musicians are looking at the return of live music as an opportunity to ask fans to reconsider the gig-going experience and make it anew. The pandemic was a terrifying time for artists outside pop’s top tiers. With tours cancelled, they were severed from their most reliable source of income and unable to work – and, as freelancers, often left to fall through the cracks in government support. Nevertheless, many have also said they were able to find value in the forced pause, which restored them to a slow, grounded pace of life and wellbeing that is incompatible with life on the road. As they return to touring, they are – like many workers who have the privilege of at least some agency in their jobs – understandably trying to make that experience feel a little bit more humane. Alt-pop songwriter Mitski recently asked fans to stop filming whole shows on their phones because it made her feel “as though those of us on stage are being taken from and consumed as content, instead of getting to share a moment with you”. (Photos were fine, she clarified.) You only have to look at the many videos and TikToks of her current tour, which show hundreds of other people making their version of the same video, to see how that worked out for her. And there was an ugly social media backlash, with some fans claiming that mental health disorders increased their reliance on capturing such footage to help them remember the concert later. Many artists have asked fans to wear masks to their concerts to protect each other – as well as their own livelihoods. “We only have one shot at touring this year,” tweeted 4AD songwriter Helado Negro in one of many such requests. “If we get Covid on the road the tour is wrecked and so is being able to pay bills and the energy to rally and try again.” Several artists interviewed for a Pitchfork feature on the matter also recognised that they had the potential to become super-spreaders, carrying the virus from city to city. Yet many fans responded to these pleas with indignation, interpreting them as mandates that impinged on their freedom to do as they please at gigs. (This may well be more of an issue in the US than it is the UK, though mask-wearers have been in the minority at every gig I’ve attended.) Just this week, Big Thief’s Adrianne Lenker asked fans not to talk through support acts. “There is a real magic that happens when there is a floor of actual silence when somebody is playing and performing … people are missing so much because every time there’s meant to be a silence, there’s all this white noise, chatter,” she said in an Instagram video. While there’s been no visible backlash yet – Big Thief fans perhaps being naturally inclined to reverence – you only have to circle back to Mitski to witness the most extreme kind of galling disinterest Lenker is talking about: at one recent gig, her fans reportedly sat on the floor looking at their phones during the opening act, waiting for the headline act to start. Any attempt to change or impose rules on the culture of gig-going generally meets with resistance: counterarguments that these are places for free expression, unlike the enforced decorum of the theatre or the physically passive cinema-going experience; that paying the price of entry means the ticket holder can do whatever they want (a pretty entitled argument that wouldn’t work with much other paid-in entertainment). But gigs have changed hugely in the past decade, often thanks to artists and venues taking steps to protect the audience. Sexual harassment and groping is still prevalent, but most venues and festivals have dedicated staff and zero-tolerance policies; there are multiple safe-space campaigns, and it’s not uncommon to hear musicians speak out on the issue. After the Astroworld disaster, in which 10 people died in a fatal crowd crush, fan safety has also been paramount, with artists such as Billie Eilish and John Mayer stopping their (massive) shows to check that people are OK and to ask fans to look out for one another. It’s time for us to repay the favour. This misalignment of expectations between musicians and artists doesn’t seem as extreme as that recently reported in comedy and theatre – gigs are generally loud enough to make it hard for any individual bell-end to make themselves heard. But touring life, even at its cushiest, is somewhat dehumanising: musicians getting the respect of being heard and having their work fully appreciated might go some way towards offsetting the grind of suitcase living and the lonely, adrenaline-spiking peaks and troughs of performance – not to mention the shaky revenues. And “being heard” needn’t mean fans standing in deferential silence, a level of passivity you can’t imagine appealing to many performers. What a fully embodied live experience looks like for Mitski is completely different from what it would be for, say, Stormzy or Foo Fighters. Unlike theatres and cinemas, where the room sets the rules, the beauty of gigs is that the performer establishes the mood, ideally in a kind of tacit agreement with the audience. They trust us to be part of their work – and the best type of crowd, one that’s completely all in, can be as memorable as the show. While my joy at standard-issue crowd delinquency quickly faded, just in the last six months, I have joyful memories of Caroline Polachek obsessives caterwauling to her pristine operatic vocal runs with brilliant, hilarious dedication; teenagers emerging from a Wolf Alice moshpit looking wild-eyed and damp; Arooj Aftab laughing at how solemn we all were. A gig is an invitation to join together in creating a big reciprocal feeling: a rare thrill that never gets old. Let’s keep accepting it, on the artists’ terms.

4/22/2022,"‘Hip-hop didn’t just come out of nowhere,” explains young teacher Anas to his even younger class in Casablanca Beats. He speaks of the “poverty, racism and humiliation” experienced by hip-hop’s African-American founders, and how the genre became a vehicle for self-empowerment and social change. “It’s rap that speaks of our lives, of our problems, things people aren’t supposed to know.” The Moroccan teenagers listening to Anas can relate to this. Hip-hop is now a commercial industry in the US, but around the world rap has become the lingua franca for disempowered and disaffected youth, and the soundtrack to revolution. Nowhere more so than north Africa. During the Arab spring in the 2010s, protesters in Tunisia and Egypt chanted the lyrics of Tunisian rapper El Général’s anti-corruption anthem Rais Lebled: “Misery is everywhere and the people haven’t found a place to sleep / I am speaking in name of the people who are suffering and crushed beneath the feet.” In Algeria, too, the recent Hirak movement has been backed by anti-government rap tunes such as Raja Meziane’s Allo le Système!. Even in relatively stable Morocco, there are still plenty of problems for young people to talk about, and plenty of people who don’t want them to talk, or sing, let alone dance. If it weren’t for this political bite, Casablanca Beats might be just another tale of an inspirational tutor and teens finding their voices, in the tradition of, say, Fame or Dead Poets Society. But Nabil Ayouch’s film, which played in the main competition at Cannes last year, gives us both the fantasy and the reality, and puts them side by side. The movie is mostly semi-documentary and semi-improvised. Anas’s hip-hop school actually exists, in the poor neighbourhood of Sidi Moumen (one student calls it Casablanca’s answer to the Bronx). The class were all non-professionals. Over the course of the film, we follow their evolution as performers, listen in on their heated discussions and get a taste of their difficult home lives. But there are also moments when Casablanca Beats tips into musical fantasy. Characters get solo moments to express themselves in verse or in dance, almost like mini music videos: dancer Zineb performs alone on the rooftops, for example, hanging herself from clothes lines like a puppet. Duo Ismail and Mehdi’s dream of performing to adoring crowds is made real. In one scene, the whole class confronts some religious conservatives in a street dance-off, like something out of West Side Story. “The idea was to do this film with absolute beginners, and to observe them growing and spreading their wings,” says Ayouch. This is a story close to the 53-year-old film-maker’s own life. Les Étoiles, the cultural centre in Sidi Moumen where the film is set, was founded by Ayouch himself. He shot his breakthrough 2000 feature Ali Zaoua, a tale of street children cast with non-professionals, in the area. After that, Ayouch had a desire to do something lasting for the local youth, so he formed a foundation and opened the cultural centre there in 2014. The foundation now operates five centres across Morocco. Casablanca Beats’ tough but charismatic class teacher, Anas Basbousi, is also the genuine article: a pioneer in Moroccan hip-hop who raps under the stage name Bawss. “I began my career in 2003,” he says. “At that time there were no studios or concert venues that accepted or welcomed hip-hop, so we just performed in the streets.” A decade later, hip-hop had taken hold across the region, “so that gave me the idea of creating a hip-hip school, a place where people could learn and feel at home”. Everything fell into place when he met Ayouch and established the “Positive School of Hip Hop” at Les Étoiles. “I started thinking, this is a story that the world has to know,” the film-maker says. “What happens here in this neighbourhood, the conditions in which they live, the obstacles that they have to face, even more the girls than the boys, and all the topics that are haunting them, like society, politics, religion. But also the positive energy, because that’s something that gave me a lot of hope.” For women, especially, hip-hop has been an outlet. In Casablanca Beats, their lyrics target misogyny and gender inequality at every level. When hijab-wearing Meriem is taken out of the class by her elder brother, she responds in angry verse: “For you, women are slaves / It makes me sick / For you, being a man means dominating us / Look at our mother in chains / Never had a voice and never complained.” And then there’s the dancing. “Words is one thing but dance is another,” says Ayouch. Conservatives are routinely angered by men and women intermixing in dance, and female dancers, especially, using their bodies to express themselves. “Yes, I’ve experienced this,” says student Zineb Boujemaa, the star dancer of the piece. Older Moroccans, her parents included, still associate dancing with nightclubs and loose morals. “Today, it’s become easier. Before, it was super-hard for Moroccan women to dance, but I’ve still had some bad experiences.” Inevitably, as Casablanca Beats’ storyline reflects, the Positive School has become a target for religious conservatives and traditionally-minded local people. “Sometimes they have come inside the centre to intimidate us. There were some tough moments,” says Ayouch. Basbousi agrees: “In the beginning, every week there was someone who would either try to stop a show or withdraw their child. We decided to show it in the film because that was our reality.” Basbousi invited families in to see what they were doing and build trust, he says, and the problem has subsided. Then again, Ayouch’s controversial 2015 film Much Loved, which broached the subject of prostitution in Morocco and was banned as a result, sparked riots around the centre for weeks, he says. Sidi Moumen was home to the suicide bombers who attacked central Casablanca in 2003, killing 33 civilians, and to those who struck in 2007. (Ayouch’s 2012 feature Horses of God gave a fictionalised account of the perpetrators.) Those most likely to become radicalised often come from the poorest areas. Hip-hop can provide an alternative outlet for their rage, Ayouch suggests. “There are lots of youngsters that I see singing, dancing and so on in the neighbourhood, and very often, I am wondering what kind of young people they would be today without this way of expression. Because I see where they live, I see the people that they can meet. And I see how they became very, very different from what they could have been if they had stayed in the street, or in the mosque.” Casablanca Beats captures hip-hop’s potential for transformation – personal and social – almost in real time, and the process has continued. Many of the featured students are now themselves working with the Positive School and launching careers of their own. Rap duo Ismail and Mehdi are semi-pro, recording and shooting promos. Boujemaa, who had no prior experience, is building a career as a dancer and performing internationally. Basbousi is expanding the Positive School across other centres in Morocco as well as acting professionally. As we speak he is midway through shooting a show for Arab streaming network Shahid. Ayouch, meanwhile, continues to be busy propping up much of Moroccan film culture. As with Basbousi’s experience in hip-hop, there was little film culture to speak of in Morocco when he came here in the 1990s, having been born and raised in France. “We needed to build a house,” he says. “And I wanted to be part of it. I wanted to bring my stones.” In addition to his own film and television work, he runs a busy production company – often working with his wife, Maryam Touzani, who is also a film-maker and actor – and he started a short film competition to support young film-makers. All this as well as running the Ali Zaoua Foundation, which runs Les Étoiles and the other cultural centres. “I don’t sleep much,” he says, laughing. “Since I was very young, the heroes of my childhood were teachers. My mother was a professor and a Spanish teacher. I grew up observing them. And you can see in many of my movies how the figure of the transmitter, the teacher, like Anas, is important. For me the question of transmission is crucial.”  Casablanca Beats is in cinemas from 29 April",Arts/Film,Rap the casbah: the Casablanca school giving young hip-hop stars a voice,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/21/rap-the-casbah-the-casablanca-school-giving-young-hip-hop-stars-a-voice
4/22/2022,"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will restart on Friday after a three-year hiatus and is expected to resolve a scientific cliffhanger on whether a mysterious anomaly could point to the existence of a fifth fundamental force of nature. The tantalising findings reported last year have reignited hopes that the 20 mile-long collider could deliver a second blockbuster discovery, more than a decade after the Higgs boson. Dr Mitesh Patel, a particle physicist at Imperial College London whose team was responsible for last year’s research, said: “We are going into this run with more optimism that there could be a revolution coming. Fingers crossed.” So far, everything discovered at the LHC – including the Higgs – has fallen in line with the so-called standard model. This has been the guiding theory of particle physics since the 1970s but is known to be incomplete because it fails to explain some of the deepest mysteries in physics, such as the nature of dark matter. However, data collected in the LHCb experiment, one of four huge particle detectors at Cern in Switzerland, appeared to show particles behaving in a way that could not be explained by the standard model. The experiment looked at the decay of particles called beauty quarks, which are predicted to decay at an equal rate into electrons and their heavier cousins, muons. However, the beauty quarks appeared to be turning into muons 15% less often, suggesting that an unknown factor – potentially a new force – was tipping the scales. Two of the top candidates include hypothetical force-carrying particles called leptoquarks or Z primes. “The stakes are extremely high,” Patel said. “If we confirm this, it will be a revolution of the kind we’ve not seen – certainly in my lifetime. You don’t want to mess it up.” Before the LHC was switched off for an upgrade in 2018, the team collected enough data to suggest the odds were roughly a thousand to one of the result happening by chance. But the gold standard for particle physics is a more stringent one in 3.5m level of confidence, meaning more data is needed before a discovery can be declared. There is also a lingering possibility that some unknown experimental glitch could explain the findings. “When you show this result to particle physicists, the first instinct is, ‘You guys have screwed up’ rather than it’s a new force of nature,” said Patel. “Us physicists like to be beyond sure and out the other side.” In the past year, anticipation has been heightened by further intriguing hints of physics beyond the standard model seen in other experiments, including recent unexplained findings from Fermilab in the US. “There seem to be a collection of loose threads now,” said Prof Jon Butterworth of University College London, who works on the LHC’s Atlas experiment. “It’s made me begin to think that there might be something out there within reach of this run or the next one.” If the LHC fails to reveal new science beyond the standard model, Butterworth said, this would not represent a failure but would leave the field “in a bit of a quandary” about where to look next. The third run, expected to last until 2026, follows an upgrade that has included the installation of additional powerful magnets designed to squeeze the protons inside the collider into finer, denser beams. This will increase the collision rate of particles inside the accelerator, meaning scientists will be able to observe rarer events with greater precision. Ashutosh Kotwal, an experimental particle physicist at Duke University in the US and co-leader of a research group at LHC’s Atlas experiment, said: “The potential for discovering new ideas is still so large. It’s worth noting that the data that we’ve collected so far is only one 10th of the total that we are planning. It’s too early to lose heart.”",News/Science,Large Hadron Collider to restart and hunt for a fifth force of nature,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/21/large-hadron-collider-restart-fifth-force-nature
4/22/2022,"In 1943, Branko Petrović, a teacher in Kikinda, Yugoslavia, was arrested for helping the wartime resistance movement, and was executed by the Nazis, leaving a nine-year-old daughter, Ljubica. He could never have foreseen the life that his daughter, later known as Ljubica Erickson, and who has died aged 88, would go on to have. Nonetheless his tender care, especially after her mother, Antonia Wolfe, abandoned them, had a lasting legacy. Her world outlook was informed by her father’s Christianity, Marxism and wise maxims: “We are too poor to buy cheap clothes” was one she often quoted. As a Slav, Ljubica had already experienced being defined as less human than Germans and Hungarians. She was intrepid, sourcing food for her household and confronting a relative to demand the return of stolen furniture and livestock. After her father’s death she was unofficially adopted by Branko’s lover, Milica Durić, a young widow. They remained devoted to each other for the rest of their lives. From studying English at Belgrade University Ljubica won a scholarship to the University of Birmingham. In Britain, she met John Erickson. They were married in 1957, settling in the 1960s in Edinburgh, where John became professor of defence studies at the university. The fact that his wife had been liberated by the Red Army helped John gain unique access to the Soviet military archives to produce his books The Soviet High Command (1962), The Road to Stalingrad (1975) and The Road to Berlin (1983). Ljubica was his first reader, editor, translator and sometime co-author. She was key to the Edinburgh Conversations, the 1980s roundtable discussions between Soviet and Nato military that are credited with helping end the cold war. The Ericksons’ home hosted many senior figures, generals, foreign secretaries, journalists and TV crews. Meanwhile she also looked after her children, Amanda and Mark, and became a social worker specialising in adoption and fostering. She worked hard to try to make things as good as they could be for her children in sometimes difficult circumstances. Later, she offered unstinting childcare and love to all her grandchildren. Her Yugoslav identity remained important to her. As a cook, she was a Yugoslav Elizabeth David, serving delicious “peasant” food. She was horrified by the war in the 1990s. Ljubica undertook many community roles, at her church, the Scottish Arts Club, as a children’s guardian ad litem, as a historical tour guide for the Dalyell family’s House of the Binns in Linlithgow and the Georgian House in Edinburgh, and as a trustee of the charity Deaf Action. John died in 2002.

4/22/2022,"Pity poor Fiver, who had several bons mots regarding Thursday’s relegation-infused battle between Burnley and Southampton ready to go – proper zingers they were, too – when white smoke suddenly started parping out of the chimneystack at Old Trafford. The Theatre of Dreams isn’t in the best nick at the moment, so there were initial worries that the 1967 Baby Belling that heats up all the matchday pies had finally given up the ghost, but upon closer examination it proved to be even more epochal news than that. Turns out the papal conclave had finally gotten round to making an informed decision for the first time since 1986, and so it was announced the new manager of Manchester United would be Erik ten Hag, to the surprise of absolutely nobody and the resigned disappointment of Mauricio Pochettino. Oh Mauricio! You’ll always have Paris. With multiple Dutch titles and Ajax’s first appearance in the Big Cup semis for 22 years on Ten Hag’s impressive CV, it’s not yet clear how this will go farcically wrong. Presumably his first act when he rocks up in the summer will be to bundle Cristiano Ronaldo, who can’t press to specifications, and David de Gea, unable to distribute in the style required, out of the door. But then he’d be getting rid of the club’s current leading scorer and a keeper who’s single-handedly kept the rest of the rabble clear of relegation for the past decade. It’s a poser all right, one of several facing the new man as he surveys the wreckage left by, in incremental order of blame, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Ralf Rangnick and Lord Ferg. Oh Alex! Was a portion of Rock of Gibraltar’s front tail worth all this? Ten Hag will also have to source a No 9 and a game-changing central midfielder, build a powerbase that insulates him from United’s multi-voiced corporate structure, and find a way of getting rid of Anthony Martial that doesn’t involve a hessian sack and some bricks. It’s one hell of a to-do list, but if anyone can turn around this grounded behemoth, the hottest up-and-coming managerial prospect in the world at [Fiver squints, adjusts pince-nez] 52 years old is surely the man. “Time to fasten the belts and enjoy the ride!” tooted club legend Rio Ferdinand on Social Media Disgrace Twitter, echoing the kind of excitement that every United fan will have felt, up to but not including the point at which they remembered Rio saying pretty much the same thing when Ole took over.

Fulham’s trajectory post-promotion will clearly be that of 2001, rather than 2018 or 2020.

4/22/2022,"Boris Johnson’s attempt to use his India visit to hail the success of JCB, the digger firm owned by a Tory donor, was met with a backlash on Thursday over the use of its machinery in the mass demolition of homes. The prime minister arrived in India as a fierce row rages in Delhi over the demolition of mainly Muslim settlements in an area of the capital hit by communal violence – an issue that is being considered by India’s supreme court. TV footage about the demolition controversy, running prominently on Indian channels, showed JCB bulldozers being used to flatten properties. The campaign group Amnesty India tweeted: “In the backdrop of Municipal Corporation of Delhi using JCB bulldozers to raze down shops of Muslims in north-west Delhi’s Jahangirpuri yesterday, UK prime minister’s inauguration of a JCB factory in Gujarat is not only ignorant but his silence on the incident is deafening.” Ali Khan Mahmudabad, a historian and campaigner, posted: “The British PM went to a bulldozer factory at a time such as this! Talk about optics. Wow! Garlanded bulldozers. Just what I needed to see.” During a visit to a new JCB factory, Johnson called it a “living, breathing incarnation of the umbilicus between the UK and India”. He said: “This is a world-leading factory – 600,000 diggers a year coming from India, exported from India to 110 countries with British technology.” Challenged about whether he would raise the demolition controversy with Narendra Modi when he meets the Indian prime minister on Friday, Johnson said: “We always raise the difficult issues, of course we do, but the fact is that India is a country of 1.35 billion people and it is democratic, it’s the world’s largest democracy.” The prime minister’s official spokesperson, when asked whether Johnson had visited the company because its chairman, Anthony Bamford, is a Conservative donor, responded: “No, he chose to go to the JCB factory because it is a very good illustration of UK business, working with India and the Indian government to benefit both the UK and India.” A spokesperson for JCB declined to comment. Johnson had hoped to use the two-day trip to India to highlight the close economic and security links between the two countries, but he has found himself repeatedly pressed about Partygate. Johnson took an Indian military helicopter from Ahmedabad in Gujarat to visit the new factory in Vadodara, where he inspected the works alongside Lord Bamford. The prime minister has repeatedly visited JCB factories, including during the 2019 general election campaign when he drove a digger through a wall of polystyrene bricks to demonstrate his determination to “get Brexit done”. In January 2019, when he was a backbencher, he received a £10,000 donation from the firm three days before giving a speech at its headquarters praising JCB’s business acumen.",News/Politics,Outcry in India as Boris Johnson visits JCB plant amid demolitions row,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/21/boris-johnson-visits-jcb-plant-india-demolitions-row
4/22/2022,"My friend Tony Hams, who has died from motor neurone disease aged 75, was a promoter of sustainable development who spent many years pushing the environmental agenda as a policy adviser to local government. He also helped to shape policy at a national level, and took on a number of roles promoting conservation, including as chair of the Peak District national park. Born in Devizes, Wiltshire, Tony was the son of Maurice, a baker, and Edna (nee Winter). After attending Devizes grammar school he gained a geography degree from London University and an MA in town planning from Nottingham University. His early career was spent as a planner with Cornwall, Monmouthshire and Derbyshire county councils. In 1989 the Association of Metropolitan Authorities recruited Tony as their environmental policy adviser. Shortly afterwards he was appointed local government adviser on sustainable development to the UK government. In that role he was part of the UK delegation to the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the key output from which was Agenda 21, the UN Programme of Action for Sustainable Development. This challenged local authorities everywhere to prepare their own local Agenda 21s (LA21s), aimed at securing a more sustainable future for their areas. Later, as head of the sustainable development unit at the Local Government Management Board from 1993 onwards, Tony set about unlocking the potential of LA21. Within a few years, thanks partly to his tireless encouragement and best-practice guidance, 90% of UK councils had produced an LA21. Most had also appointed officers to coordinate efforts to develop more sustainable ways of operating. Tony organised annual conferences for these environmental coordinators to help them share experiences and good practice. Between 1993 and 1998 he was also a UK delegate to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development in New York. In 1998 he was appointed to the board of the Peak District national park, soon becoming the park’s chair, a position he held with pride and distinction until 2008. He then became chair of the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust and a board member of the East Midlands Heritage Lottery Fund. Tony’s strength lay in his calm ability to inspire and persuade partners in the public and NGO sectors to work towards common goals. He was appointed OBE in 1999 for services to sustainable development. With typical self-deprecation he maintained the letters stood for “other buggers’ efforts”. He lived in Tideswell in Derbyshire, where he loved walking the local hills with the family’s Irish setter, Gina, supporting Tideswell United football club and enjoying a pint in the Horse and Jockey. He is survived by his wife, Angela (nee Beresford), a graphic designer, whom he married in 2000, and their son, George.",News/Environment,Tony Hams obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/21/tony-hams-obituary
4/22/2022,"Hello, and happy Thursday, On Monday morning, I’ll be in Memphis, where Pamela Moses is set to make her first court appearance since having her six-year prison sentence for trying to register to vote overturned. Moses, a 44-year-old Black Lives Matter activist, will probably find out whether prosecutors intend to pursue a new trial against her. Part of why I’ve been so interested in the case is because it offers one of the starkest examples of disparities in punishment Black people face when it comes to voting errors. Just to recap the case so far: Moses lost her voting rights in 2015, when she was convicted of a felony and sentenced to seven years of probation. But no one told her she was ineligible to vote and election officials never removed her from the rolls. She continued to vote regularly. In 2019, Moses attempted to go through the process for people with felonies to register to vote. Election officials became aware of her ineligibility because she was running for mayor. Even though a probation officer signed a form saying she was eligible, and Moses says she didn’t know she couldn’t vote, a jury convicted her of knowingly consenting to false information on an election document in November 2021 She was sentenced to six years in prison in January this year. In February, the Guardian published a document showing that the Tennessee department of corrections had investigated the matter and blamed the probation officer. That document had not been provided to Moses before her trial and the judge overseeing her case granted her request for a new one. Amy Weirich, the district attorney prosecuting the case, has not yet decided whether to pursue a retrial, a spokesman told me on Wednesday. Moses and her lawyers are pushing to have the case dropped. The document in question is a form that anyone with a felony conviction has to get filled out if they want to vote. On 3 September 2019, a probation officer signed and filled out the form for Moses and incorrectly said she had completed probation (in Tennessee, people with felonies can only vote once they complete their sentences entirely, including probation). Moses was also ineligible to vote because she was convicted of tampering with evidence, one of a handful of crimes that causes you to permanently lose your voting rights in Tennessee, something the probation officer was also unaware of. Even though Moses never signed the form, prosecutors still charged her with a felony because they said she knew she was ineligible. She knew she was ineligible, prosecutors argue, because she was trying to run for mayor in 2019 and courts had told her repeatedly that she couldn’t appear on the ballot because she was still on probation. As I’ve followed Moses’ case for the last few months, I’ve become really interested in a question that wasn’t discussed at her trial and remains unanswered: why did she decide to get the probation office to fill out the form and register to vote in 2019 in the first place? Kirby May, the prosecutor who handled Moses’ case, offered a simple answer to this question during her trial. Moses, he said, was like a child who keeps going “gimme, gimme, gimme” to their parents, he said, determined to get what she wanted. “She knew what she was doing on September 3. She was desperate to try to get her rights restored, she wanted to run for mayor,” he said, according to a trial transcript. “She was desperate. She didn’t care, she was going to try anyway. This was her last-stitch [sic] effort.” Moses told me she only filled out the voting document because the elections commission encouraged her to do so. In the late summer of 2019, she received a letter from the elections commission telling her there was an issue with her voter registration. She was confused and called up the elections commission, which told her to get her rights restored. “I didn’t know I had to go through the process again of restoring, doing the form, until they sent me notice that I was no longer able to vote,” she told me the first time we spoke, back in December. “They told me to do it. They said that had to be done before I could re-register.” Internal records from the Shelby county election commission, obtained through a public records request, support Moses’ recollection. They indicate Moses was sent a letter on 20 August 2019 informing her that she was being cancelled from the voter rolls because of a felony conviction. But the elections commission has been unable to produce a record of the actual letter. The two election employees who testified during Moses’ trial, including one who specializes in restoration of voting rights, were not asked whether they encouraged her to go through the process. The underlying issue in Moses’ case is whether she knew was ineligible to vote when the probation officer signed off on the form. So it could be potentially significant to know what, if anything, election officials told her about going through the process. “It may not be the ‘smoking gun’ that requires an acquittal, but this still supports her version that she received a permissive letter and therefore did not knowingly make a false entry,” said Bennett Capers, a former federal prosecutor who teaches law at Fordham University. There’s another issue that complicates whether Moses knew the information on the form was false. Moses was ineligible to vote because she was on probation, but the form doesn’t say anything about probation. It says someone can vote if they’ve been released from “supervision”. When Moses filled out the form, she was on unsupervised probation, which could have reasonably led her to believe she was eligible, her lawyer during her trial argued. Even the judge supervising the case got tripped up over this. “She’s still on probation. She’s never received a final release from supervision. I guess that depends on how you interpret supervision,” the judge said. As I’ve been preparing to cover Moses’ potential retrial, I’ve also been curious to learn how common it is for someone in Tennessee to be charged with the specific crime Moses faces, knowingly consenting or making a false entry on an election document. It doesn’t seem to very common at all. In Davidson county, home to Nashville, the clerk’s office told me they had no record of someone being charged under that specific statute in their database. Clerks in Knox and Hamilton counties said the same. In Shelby county, where Moses lives, there are 79 instances in which that charge has been used. Just one case in the last 10 years has been filed under it, the clerk’s office said. That case is Moses’. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, is moving ahead with a brazen effort to blunt Black political power in his state.

4/22/2022,"Back of the net! Kiss my face! Jacka-nacka-nory! That’s right, Lynn, it’s a busy week for actor, comedian, writer, podcaster and all-round showbiz Swiss army knife Steve Coogan. He’s not only starring in timely new Channel 4 comedy-drama Chivalry, created with co-star Sarah Solemani, but, as a certain Alan Gordon Partridge, is about to embark on a Ted Talk-style live tour called Stratagem. Which deserves credit for working as a potential Apprentice team name too. Textbook. In the meantime, we’ve ranked all his major TV roles from worst to best. As Alan Partridge likes to say before sex: let battle commence … A rare misfire from Coogan’s early days as a flat-out character comic. The smarmy, deeply sexist Portuguese crooner starred in spoof showbiz spectacular The Tony Ferrino Phenomenon (even though he couldn’t pronounce the word “phenomenon”). A two-time winner of “Denmark’s coveted Golden Throat award”, he specialised in treacly Euro-ballads and any resemblance to the likes of Julio Iglesias, Tom Jones and Engelbert Humperdinck was, we imagine, entirely coincidental. Coogan went for it wholeheartedly but Ferrino was a one-joke creation, stretched thinner than his own skin-tight leatherette trousers. In a role originally intended for the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, this US black comedy starred Coogan as a whining middle-aged ad exec forced to settle for being “happyish”. It aimed at literate and Woody Allen-ish but came off as smugly pretentious and failed to find its funny bone. After one underwhelming series, it was axed. Unluckyish. This six-part anthology parodied both Brit horror films and Roald Dahl’s Tales of the Unexpected. Coogan introduced stories as the eponymous slaphead and starred in each instalment, spoofing such spooky staples as witchcraft, mad scientists and voodoo curses. Which presumably sounded funnier on paper than it turned out onscreen. “I’m 24, single and gagging for it. Only joking, I’m 25.” Paul’s brassy bombshell sister, played by Coogan in drag, starred in Pauline Calf’s Wedding Video. This Bafta-winning special, subtitled Three Fights, Two Weddings and a Funeral, followed her tottering up the aisle towards fiance Spiros (Patrick Marber). The Patrick Swayze superfan’s catchphrase was “I’ve had him!”. Under pseudonym Paulette Vache, she was the author of two self-help books: Stallion Heart and She Shat Herself. Dated gags and the whiff of misogyny prevent Pauline placing higher. This feature-length dramedy was mainly notable for launching the TV careers of James Corden and David Walliams – not to mention a drug-addled Russell Brand, who got fired after heading ashore for nights of debauchery in a strip club. Set aboard a fan cruise held in honour of fictitious 80s sci-fi series Children of Castor, it finds Coogan playing to type as the show’s cocky former star. He had since gone on to Hollywood (latest film credit: Sherlock Holmes in Miami) while his castmates, well, hadn’t. As Larry David’s floppy-haired psychiatrist, Coogan’s one-episode stint was certainly memorable. The Therapists found Dr Bright dispensing unwise romantic advice to LD – notably to give estranged wife Cheryl an ultimatum – before becoming his patient’s partner-in-crime, mugging Cheryl’s own shrink and ending up in prison. Talk about a dramatic arc. “I’m trying to be nice but sometimes it comes out horrible.” Coogan riffs amusingly on his unreconstructed image in this cameo-crammed comedy-drama about sexual politics in the post-#MeToo era. As foppish, womanising Hollywood film producer Cameron O’Neill, he’s basically Alan Partridge in a better suit as he struggles with the new world of female agency, toxic masculinity and on-set intimacy coordinators. Despite his terror of being cancelled, he can’t resist dating actors and assistants half his age – a paradox with which Coogan also plays in The Trip. Coogan played all six protagonists in this anthology series but the already established Paul Calf aside, by far the most memorable was egotistical computer soundcard salesman Cheeseman. Wearing his best Hugo Boss suit and shouting: “You’re a tiger! Grrr!” into the bathroom mirror, he desperately tried to seal a big contract at a sales conference until fate tragically intervened. An enjoyably awful creation, although Gareth’s stunted emotions and car fixation had echoes of you-know-who. This three-parter from Royle Family writers Craig Cash and Phil Mealey is something of a neglected gem. Coogan played it pretty straight as gambling-addicted Stockport binman Bob “Bing” Crosby, kicked out of the marital home and forced to move in with his ailing geriatric father (the magnificent Bernard Hill). In a performance full of charm, he adroitly handled its tonal shifts from well-observed whimsy to weepy tragedy. Based on Driscoll’s memoir In Pursuit of the Truth, this engrossing ITV miniseries recreated the Lawrence family’s fight for justice after the sickening racist murder of teenager Stephen. As the Met detective who finally gave the case the respect it deserved, Coogan gave a restrained turn as diligent Driscoll, belatedly catching the killers with “common sense coppering”. He arguably lacked dramatic heft but, as an everyman hero, handled a rare straight role with aplomb. Coogan donned a luxuriant wig and led a heavyweight cast in this unjustly forgotten curiosity. As the philandering 17th-century diarist, put on trial for embezzling navy funds, he was impishly irreverent and full of eyebrow-waggling intrigue. The bawdy, Blackadder-esque costume comedy proved a pre-Christmas ratings hit for BBC Two, pulling in 3 million viewers. “Listen, you bloody dildo, I was hoovering up furlongs of the devil’s dandruff with Lucifer Reed and changing the fuse on Peter Frampton’s vocoder while you were still shitting rusks.” One of Coogan’s more underrated creations was this spiky suburban antihero, whose mid-00s sitcom ran for two series. The roadie turned pest controller had anger issues and a fondness for his own voice but was genuinely witty, while his relationships with girlfriend Magz (Ruth Jones) and protege Raymond (Rasmus Hardiker) were slyly affecting. Certain Saxondale traits feel like a dry run for later iterations of Partridge. Bag o’ shite. The bleach-mulleted Mancunian lager lout began life as a standup character called Duncan Disorderly. He shot to cult fame in 1993 when, renamed Paul Calf, he stole the show on Jonathan Ross’ variety vehicle Saturday Zoo. The student-hating, Cortina-driving pub philosopher later starred in an episode of Coogan’s Run and two video diaries. Hidden depths came from his flashes of insecurity and obsession with ex Julie, but it was his much-abused best mate “fat blobby bastard cake-in-his-gob Bob” (John Thomson) we felt sorry for. It doesn’t get much more meta than this midlife crisis comedy, which finds real-life frenemies Coogan and Rob Brydon playing exaggerated versions of themselves on culinary road trips around the Lake District, Italy, Spain and Greece. Cue Michelin-starred food and competitive impersonations. What could be a giant in-joke is elevated into existential brilliance by Michael Winterbottom’s direction and Coogan’s precision-tuned performance, in which he’s the more successful but dark and dissatisfied of the riffing duo. In later series, Steve’s struggles to bond with his student son, and the death of his father, were quietly devastating. What else could it be? North Norfolk’s most gaffe-prone broadcaster is the part Coogan was born to play. The 56-year-old has now been wearing Partridge’s trademark blazers for more than half his life and it shows. He knows his every twitch and nuance, having painstakingly fleshed him out from a catchphrase-spouting caricature to a layered creation of subtle pathos. From his beginnings as a bumptious sports reporter to his current co-hosting gig on One Show-alike magazine programme This Time, the sports casual-clad little Englander has become one of our most enduring and beloved comic characters.

4/22/2022,"Boris Johnson has been called “Mr U-turn” in his time as prime minister this reputation has been well-earned. A conservative count gives more than 30 often panicked policy changes since the 2019 general election. 31 January 2020The BBC quoted the prime minister as saying the “best thing would be to ignore” Covid around the time the first UK case was detected; a claim Downing Street declined to deny. Ministers soon had to take drastic action. 12 March 2020Mass testing was ended despite World Health Organization (WHO) advice that it was vital. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, subsequently announced a target of 500,000 tests a day by the end of October 2020. 20 May 2020A scheme granting indefinite leave to remain in the UK to relatives of foreign national NHS staff who died from Covid-19 initially excluded cleaners, porters and social care workers. It was eventually extended to low-paid workers. 21 May 2020Johnson backed away from a policy requiring people coming to the UK to work for the NHS to pay a health surcharge. 3 June 2020Ministers dropped their opposition to allowing proxy voting for shielding MPs amid significant opposition. 16 June 2020Johnson belatedly bowed to pressure to help feed hungry children outside school term time, insisting he had been unaware of his own government’s concerted fight against the England footballer’s campaign. 18 June 2020Several months and millions of pounds after backing an NHS anti-Covid app, ministers finally acknowledged it would not work. 9 June 2020Johnson insisted primary schools in England should reopen. But ministers eventually agreed to listen to experts who had warned the plan was unworkable. 14 July 2020The government insisted face coverings should not be mandatory in shops because people would not be in close proximity for long. Weeks later, they became mandatory in England. 14 July 2020Johnson had ignored Washington’s warnings that Huawei posed a threat. But he backtracked and it was announced that Huawei kit would be stripped out of the 5G phone networks. 10 August 2020Ministers finally agreed to adopt a regional approach to contact tracing – following the examples of some foreign nations – after months of pursuing a £10bn centralised contact-tracing model. 15 August 2020Johnson initially insisted 2020’s A-level results were “robust” and the education secretary said there would be no U-turn on their calculation. Within two days, the government U-turned. 25 August 2020Days before secondary schools in England were due to reopen, Johnson scrapped his government’s plan to advise against wearing face masks. 20 August 2020Ministers made a series of threats to lift the ban on evictions imposed during the pandemic – including in August 2020 – and relented several times. 31 October 2020Having ignored scientific advice in favour of a two-week national “circuit breaker” lockdown for England in September, Johnson announced a month-long lockdown for November. 5 November 2020The chancellor had looked to wind down the furlough scheme. But he was forced into a series of embarrassing climbdowns because of the scale of the second coronavirus wave. 8 November 2020Ministers took up the fight against Rashford once again. And, once again, they backed down; announcing a £170m winter grant scheme for families struggling due to Covid. 19 December 2020Johnson again tried to avoid making a decision on Covid restrictions and, again, was forced to belatedly introduce them. The nation’s Christmas plans were plunged into chaos. 4 January 2021A day after urging children to return to classrooms, insisting it was safe, Johnson announced it was not safe even to leave the house and locked England down. 26 June 2021Johnson accepted Matt Hancock’s apology for breaching social distancing guidelines and declared the matter “closed” on the Friday. Johnson accepted Hancock’s resignation on the Saturday. 18 July 2021The prime minister and chancellor were forced to self-isolate after coming into contact with the health secretary, who had contracted Covid. They had tried to avoid it, claiming to be part of a pilot testing scheme. 13 July 2021In his 2019 manifesto, Johnson promised overseas aid spending of 0.7% of GDP. About a year and a half later, he cut billions of pounds from the budget. 14 July 2021Johnson demanded action against people guilty of racial abuse at football matches after being criticised for offering tacit backing to those who booed England’s players taking the knee to protest against racial abuse at football matches. 17 July 2021Plans to allow Britons who have had two jabs to return from amber list countries without isolating for up to 10 days were dropped in respect of France – one of the most popular destinations – at the last minute. 21 July 2021Johnson trumpeted the deal he struck over Brexit. But, within less than two years, his government was already trying to unpick it, claiming it had proven unworkable. 22 July 2021An insistence that double-vaccinated critical workers would not be exempted from self-isolation was dropped as hundreds of thousands were pinged. 20 August 2021Ministers backed away from their initial refusal to support 125 Afghan guards who protected the British embassy in Kabul before its fall. It later emerged only one had made it to the UK. 8 September 2021Johnson was accused of breaking a key manifesto pledge not to raise taxes when his government brought forward plans to hike national insurance contributions. 12 September 2021Vaccine passport plans were dropped only two weeks after Downing Street insisted it would press ahead. Within another two days, the prime minister raised the prospect yet again. 24 September 2021With queues forming at fuel stations, ministers were forced to rethink their post-Brexit anti-immigration stance and invite thousands of foreign lorry drivers to the UK. 26 October 2021Ministers announced a partial U-turn after reject calls to place a legal duty on water companies to reduce raw sewage discharges into rivers. 4 November 2021Plans to immediately scrap the parliamentary standards system were dropped amid public fury, as the Tories were accused of acting to protect one of their own. 21 April 2022 Tory MPs were initially told to vote for an amendment that would effectively torpedo Labour efforts to place Johnson under parliamentary investigation – only for No 10 to change its mind on the morning of the debate and give MPs a free vote.",News/Politics,Charge … retreat!

4/22/2022,"The three plays about King Henry VI rank low in the Shakespearean canon for character and poetry but paradoxically have the heaviest popular culture presence, as an acknowledged source for the regicidal TV epic Game of Thrones. The middle drama also contains one of Shakespeare’s most quoted lines, “the first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers,” spoken by an ally of Jack Cade, the populist demagogue who, as proxy for the Yorkists, threatens the House of Lancaster’s hold on the throne. The production by Owen Horsley (RSC boss Gregory Doran, on compassionate leave, is “consultant director”) imposes no strenuous topicalities but is alert to the fact that a wobbling monarchy and the vulnerability of a populace to muscular false promise particularly chime with this revival. Shakespeare covers most human and political possibilities and, through Cade, skewers the year zero egotists of which Boris Johnson is the latest exemplar. “Burn all the records of the realm. My mouth shall be the parliament of England,” declares the self-glorying rebel during a campaign based on denigrating the French and pledging unlimited state expenditure. Warned that he has said something “false”, Cade shrugs: “Ay, there’s the question; but I say ’tis true.” Aaron Sidwell’s swaggering braggart, giddied by the possibility of tyranny as success swells him, directly references no current public mannerisms, but those who watched prime minister’s questions on their phones just before the 1pm start at the Royal Shakespeare theatre marvelled anew at Shakespeare’s historical prescience. What academics call the H6 plays are staged rarely and, even then, in mashups of the English history cycle. Horsley and Doran create Henry VI: Rebellion from the first four acts of part two and join the remaining scenes to part three to create Wars of the Roses. Such reshaping reflects that these are early plays, the dramatist sketching scenes of witchcraft, a deranged exiled king, women who out-power their men and the dynamics of popular power that will mature in Macbeth, King Lear and Coriolanus. Another complication is that the bloodlines and fault lines between the founding fathers of Yorkshire and Lancashire, thickened by French intermarriage, can seem impossibly convoluted: this version helps by giving characters white or red roses on their costumes like November poppies, and using live video capture on a downstage screen to underline those being mentioned or remembered. As much of the plot turns on ownership of territory on either side of the Channel, stretches of text sound as if people are reciting English cricket and French football leagues at each other. This version trims these but, at a time when many directors quietly rewrite dead words, actors are trusted, in the RSC tradition, to transmit antique meanings. “Porpentine” is changed to “porcupine” but multiple obscurities, such as “conventicles” (conferences) and “alderliefest” (most dear) are kept. With the percentage of great lines low by Shakespearean standards, the production sensibly focuses on the action – flinch-inducing battles, power brokers squaring up – and deep mining of psychology. Mark Quartley vividly captures the sixth King Henry’s combination of frail body and strong mind and pious focus on his soul. Minnie Gale, as his Queen Margaret, rivetingly embodies a sensual warrior queen who seems to cross Joan of Arc (a character in part one) with a flattering fantasy of the playwright’s patron, Elizabeth I. Oliver Alvin-Wilson’s Duke of York projects the charismatic physicality, deviousness and resentments that his son Richard will only two thirds inherit. Arthur Hughes’s stinging delivery of the soliloquies of “misshapen Dick” (as Margaret calls him) excitingly previews the Richard III he will play in June. A stage direction calling for “infinite numbers” would stretch even generous Arts Council England funding, but the use of regional community troupes (from Nottingham on press day) and RSC Next Generation youth performers give a proper sense of crowds in plays to which their power is so pivotal. After two years of pandemic disruption and the demoralising death of one of its greatest actors, Sir Antony Sher, the RSC shows all its strengths in making minor Shakespeare a thrilling major event.

4/22/2022,"The number of documented violations of legislation designed to reduce water pollution caused by agriculture in England has hit record levels as the rules remain largely unenforced. Last year had the highest number of recorded violations of the farming rules for water since the legislation was introduced in April 2018, and environmental groups estimate tens of thousands of English farms continue to commit undocumented violations. A total of 391 breaches were identified during the 2021-2022 financial year, which ended on 31 March, up from 106 breaches officially recorded in the previous year, according to data obtained by the Guardian and the investigative journalism organisation Point Source. Despite the farming rules for water having been implemented more than four years ago, and the rising number of breaches being documented, the Environment Agency has yet to issue any fines or prosecute anyone under the legislation. The increasing number of documented offences and the absence of a credible threat of enforcement of the law demonstrates a clear failure by the government to protect the country’s most fragile ecosystems, according to conservation organisations. “It makes a mockery of our democracy and the rule of law if polluters are not prosecuted for blatant offences which cause misery and huge costs for many other people and businesses,” said Mark Lloyd, the chief executive of the Rivers Trust, a charity that works to protect Britain’s lakes and waterways. “Agricultural pollution is the principal reason why our rivers are in such poor shape and ministers need to give regulators the resources and the mandate to take action against persistent offenders.” The farming rules for water legislation gives the Environment Agency the power to prosecute or fine individuals and companies found to be polluting waterways with contaminated runoff water or acting in a way that creates a high risk of pollution. Under the legislation, fixed penalties of £100 or £300 can be issued as well as “variable money penalties”, which can be as much as £250,000. The rules were designed to combat agricultural pollution that is causing widespread environmental problems in rivers. They focus mainly on the storage and distribution of animal waste and fertiliser in order to prevent damaging pollutants from farms running into rivers where excessive quantities of nitrogen can cause algae blooms that lead to oxygen depletion. Runoff from agriculture is the biggest single polluter of rivers, responsible for 40% of damage to waterways, according to a report published by the Environment Agency in September 2020. The report revealed that no river in the country had achieved good chemical status and only 14% were found to be of a good ecological standard. Fertiliser runoff from farmland can kill fish and plants and have a knock-on impact for other wildlife that are part of the ecosystem, such as birds. Over the past two financial years a total of 2,053 Environment Agency inspections have taken place identifying a total of 497 violations of the farming rules for water, according to data obtained by the Guardian. The high number of violations discovered has led environmental organisations to estimate that around a fifth of the 106,000 farm businesses regulated by the Environment Agency are likely to be breaching the rules. Nick Measham, the chief executive of the environmental group Salmon and Trout Conservation, said: “The new figures regarding the increasing number of officially documented violations and the failure to enforce sanctions are extremely concerning. “Given our experience gained through our monitoring and the extremely low level of site visits carried out by the Environment Agency, it is conservative to estimate that as many as 20,000 of England’s farms would be likely to fail an inspection – if they were actually inspected.” An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We seek to use advice and guidance to bring farms into compliance, and impose sanctions only where farmers repeatedly fail to take necessary action. “The secretary of state has issued new guidance on the interpretation of the rules and has said that if the Environment Agency determines that land managers have followed this guidance he does not normally expect them to take enforcement action.” The Environment Agency’s decision not to use the sanctions at its disposal has been heavily criticised by conservation groups, who say that not punishing farming companies for breaking the law is having severe ecological consequences. Alec Taylor, head of production policy at WWF, said: “The persistent failure to enforce these regulations, not least due to the systematic underfunding of the relevant regulatory bodies, reflects the UK government’s lacklustre approach to cleaning up England’s precious freshwater habitats.” “UK nature is in freefall and … ministers simply cannot afford to keep shirking their responsibility to protect and restore these habitats, which are home to rare and vulnerable species like allis shad, otters and freshwater pearl mussels.” Alice Groom, the RSPB’s senior policy officer, said: “Clearly the current system is not working if farmers and landowners feel the risk of punishment is near non-existent or the rewards for being responsible are not there. “Failure to improve regulation will not only threaten the health of our natural environments and biodiversity, but also prevent the government from delivering against any of its new legally binding targets under the Environment Act.” The Environment Act was passed last year and, in March, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs set out targets under the act to reduce nutrient pollution in water in England. It said it would cut phosphorus in treated sewage by 80% by 2037, and reduce nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment from agriculture by 40% by 2037.",News/Environment,Breaches of English farm pollution laws rise as rules remain largely unenforced,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/21/breaches-of-english-farm-pollution-laws-rise-as-rules-remain-largely-unenforced
4/22/2022,"Occupation Editor of a social affairs magazine Voting record When he lived in London, Brian voted Labour. He is not impressed with what’s on offer politically in Northern Ireland. Voted remain Amuse bouche While on an assignment, he spent an evening with the singer-songwriter John Martyn in a hotel room, drinking Guinness and whiskey Occupation University professor Voting record John votes Green and is a former Green councillor. Voted remain but has lost faith in the EU since Amuse bouche As a student in Dublin in the 80s, John stripped naked in McDonald’s in protest over beef imports from Costa Rica. It was his last day working there Brian I looked into the window of the restaurant and spotted John sitting there. Because I’m a journalist, we’ve met at different events. I thought: I’ll say hello to him, and then I’ll find who I’m meeting. But then I saw the photographer beside him. We must have laughed for about 10 minutes. John I don’t know Brian that well, but we’ve bumped into each other over the years. I suppose it’s a mark of how Belfast is a village. Brian I started off with the JFK. It had cumin in it, cauliflower, soya, sesame … Every time the waiter came over, he’d ask: “What are you arguing about now?” John I asked if there were any vegan options on the menu, without realising we were in a vegetarian restaurant. Brian Seeing people like Nigel Farage were for Brexit, I didn’t have to find out much more to stand against. Even from a capitalist point of view, here’s a big market comprising the European Union: how could Britain be in any way stronger outside that economic force? It made no sense to me. John I’ve become disillusioned with the EU – its constitutionalising and the privatisation of services. It’s only at nation state level that we can have welfare reform or move towards a social democratic, even a socialist, direction. Brian I nearly choked on my food. At heart, I’m an internationalist. I believe in open borders, free travel, citizens of the world. The EU could be made more worker-oriented. I don’t understand the isolation approach at all. John Brian’s view was that the EU could be reformed. That’s a pipe dream. Brian As someone who grew up seeing checkpoints on the border, queues piling up and violence, I definitely don’t want to see any of that return. John We could both see how Brexit has hastened the debate around a united Ireland. Brexiters are willing to abandon Northern Ireland for a hard Brexit. Brian Both of us opposed the Russian attack on Ukraine. But we also have concerns about Nato expansionism. John To be anti-Nato is not to be pro-Putin. There is an argument that assurances were given to Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, guaranteeing neutrality and borders. Brian The fact that Nato has been expanding up to the borders with Russia has exacerbated the situation. John We were both disappointed by the milk-and-water leadership of Keir Starmer. Brian He’s just a lightweight Tory. John But the discussion went on to why Labour lost in 2019, and the role of Corbyn. And we had furious disagreement on these big issues, though they are small points – that’s always the way with lefties. If Corbyn had come out clearly accepting the vote and saying we’re going to implement a lexit – the leftwing version of Brexit – that may have prevented the “red wall” from falling. But unfortunately he was hamstrung by the remoaners within Labour. Brian I thought this lexit idea was lunacy. Corbyn failed badly on Brexit. I think he should have said: I’m a European, an internationalist, and we can have a different Europe, but we’re not having anything to do with Brexit. Brian We had differences, but it shows the importance of good conversation and good food – we need to put our phones down and talk more. John Even when you have people on the same ideological page, you can have profound disagreements. Those issues of Brexit and Corbyn are really deeply rooted – they’re not trivial. But people of good faith can disagree, especially with a good bit of humour and lots of bad language.  Brian and John ate at Jumon in Belfast Want to meet someone from across the divide?
