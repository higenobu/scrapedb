12/31/2021,"UK bank Santander is trying to recoup $175 million that it paid to customers by mistake. A technical error meant that 75,000 scheduled payments were accidentally duplicated. One person affected told Insider that she thought she'd been paid twice on Christmas Day. The UK bank Santander is trying to recoup $175 million (£130 million) that it accidentally transferred to customers on Christmas Day morning. A technical error led to 75,000 scheduled and one-off payments to be paid twice by the bank's system, The Times of London first reported. A spokesperson for the bank said that the error had been identified and rectified. It will work to recover the duplicated transactions over the coming days, the spokesperson added. The error affected 2,000 commercial and corporate accounts, which means many of those receiving money are employees or suppliers, who are customers of different banks. Jenny, a UK resident, who did not want to provide her surname, was among those affected. She told Insider that she thought she'd been paid twice. She received her scheduled wage of £1764.50 on December 24. She then received a second payment for the same amount the next day. Both were listed as being from her employer, however, when she contacted them they said they hadn't paid the money. After investigating, her employer said that the bank would be resolving the issue and that she didn't need to do anything. The payments came from Santander's own funds, so individuals were unaffected. Nevertheless, Jenny described it as ""frustrating."" She added: ""It was confusing, I just wanted it out of my account because it's hard to tell how much money you have."" The Santander spokesperson told Insider that the problem only affected UK customers and that the process for recovering the funds is ""underway and working effectively."" The industry's bank error recovery process enables banks to retrieve transactions from third-party banks. In some cases, Santander may also contact those affected directly. According to Jenny's bank statement, seen by Insider, the second payment of £1764.50 was retracted on December 30. Jenny is a customer of a different bank, NatWest. This suggests that at least some of the challenges Santander were facing have been resolved. The spokesperson did not give a timeframe for when the issue will be fully resolved, however. Spanish-owned Santander has 14 million active customers and approximately 20,000 employees. Banks' digital payment systems can be prone to errors. It's not the first glitch to affect Santander's payments this year. In May, some customers were unable to pay for goods after a technical issue temporarily affected card payments.

12/31/2021,"DES MOINES, Iowa — The county attorney prosecuting the case of two southeast Iowa teens charged with murder in the death of their high school Spanish teacher said in court documents they surveilled her pattern of life, ambushed her along her daily walk and dragged her into the woods, returning later to better hide her lifeless body. Those additional details of the death of Nohema Graber in early November were revealed in a Dec. 23 filing in the case of Jeremy Goodale, 16, of Fairfield. He is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder with classmate Willard Miller, also 16. Attorneys for both teens have asked a judge to move their case to juvenile court. Hearings on the requests are scheduled for Jan. 27. In court documents filed Dec. 23, Jefferson County Attorney Chauncy Moulding offered the additional details of Graber's death. Graber, 66, was reported missing Nov. 2 and her remains were found later that day in a park. Authorities earlier confirmed she had suffered ""inflicted trauma to the head"" and her body was found concealed under a tarp, wheelbarrow and railroad ties at the Chautauqua Park in Fairfield, about 95 miles southeast of Des Moines. 'An act like this is unspeakable': 2 Iowa teens charged with killing high school Spanish teacher 'Intent to kill': A visual timeline of deadly shooting at Oxford High School Authorities have not released a motive. Both teens attended Graber's Spanish class at Fairfield High School, where she had taught since 2012. Moulding argued trying Goodale as an adult is the only appropriate plan because he would be released at age 18 — in less than 24 months — if he is tried and convicted in the juvenile court system. ""This prosecuting attorney cannot fathom any combination of programming at any Iowa juvenile facility which could appropriately treat or rehabilitate the defendant if adjudicated as a juvenile,"" he said. Miller's attorney has made a similar request and Moulding resisted for many of the same reasons. Miller and Goodale are being held on $1 million cash bond in juvenile detention facilities awaiting trial. Both have pleaded not guilty. Moulding charged them as adults with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The sentence in Iowa would be life in prison for first-degree murder as an adult, although a 2016 Iowa Supreme Court ruling requires juveniles to have a chance of release when given life sentences. Nikolas Cruz, who killed 17 people at a Florida high school, has pleaded guilty to all 34 counts of premeditated and attempted murder.
