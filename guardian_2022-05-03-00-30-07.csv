5/3/2022,"The US government’s highest-ranking trans official has condemned political attacks on LGBTQ+ communities and accentuated the importance of gender-affirming care for trans youth. Speaking on Saturday in Fort Worth, Texas, US assistant secretary of health Rachel Levine addressed fellow physicians about conservative politicians’ attacks on LGBTQ+ communities. “Today, many of our fellow human beings across the country call for our attention because they’re being attacked, and they see few places to turn,” Levine said. “I want to say this very, very clearly: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Americans are committing suicide at a rate that should shock our conscience.” Levine, a trained pediatrician who specialized in adolescent medicine at Penn State University, said 52% of trans and non-binary young people contemplated suicide in 2020, elaborating on the mental health crisis occurring among LGBTQ+ youth. “Think about how many of them thought it was better to die than to put up with any more harassment, scapegoating and intentional abuse,” Levine added. Levine also said that for many LGBTQ+ young people struggling with poor mental health, a “single caring adult” is “the difference between life and death”. During the speech, Levine underscored the importance of gender-affirming care for trans youth, a healthcare measure that Republicans have worked to deny trans young people in recent months. “Gender-affirming care is medical care,” Levine said. “It is mental health care. It is suicide prevention care. It improves quality of life, and it saves lives.” According to studies Levine cited in her speech, recipients of gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers and hormones, had much lower rates of depression and suicide. “The positive value of gender-affirming care is not in serious scientific or medical dispute,” Levine said. Levine delivered her remarks as several states pass or propose laws prosecuting trans youth and their caretakers. Specifically in Texas, the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, accused parents who provide their children with gender-affirming care of “abuse,” instructing the state’s child protection services in March to investigate any such case. Alabama state lawmakers last month criminalized gender-affirming medical treatments to for transgender people 18 or younger, threatening medical providers and parents with prison time and fines. The US justice department has joined efforts to strike that law down as discriminatory and unconstitutional. Iowa also passed a law in March that bans trans girls and women from participating in high school and college athletics, despite arguments that the bill was discriminatory, too, and addressed a manufactured problem. Levine said it was imperative to oppose those who invoke science and the principles of child protection to justify anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. “The language of medicine and science is being used to drive people to suicide,” Levine said. “The mantle of concern for children is being claimed to destroy children’s lives. “We have to stand up. We have to take a stand on behalf of those who are being hurt. We have to be doctors. This is what we do, even when it’s difficult.”",News/US news,America’s top-ranked trans official condemns attacks on LGBTQ+ youth,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/02/rachel-levine-trans-official-lgbtq-attacks
5/3/2022,"For more than two months, Vladimir Putin has been violently trying to erase the modern Ukrainian state from the map of Europe. This means Ukraine needs to win. In fact, victory is imperative if the continent wants to stand the chance of being able to live in peace and work collectively to meet global challenges. It is clear that Putin has failed to compel Kyiv to capitulate. Russia’s plans to annihilate Ukraine and annex more of its territory have cemented Ukraine’s will to fight and win this war. So we need to ask: what does victory actually look like? For Ukraine’s government, it means first that the Russian army is defeated on the battlefields of Donbas and is pushed back to where it was stationed before 24 February 2022. Polling, meanwhile, indicates consensus among the people regarding the return of Crimea and Donbas to the control of Kyiv and opposition to a truce with Russia until it fully withdraws its troops. What is needed is the creation of an effective diplomatic forum to negotiate further Russian withdrawal from the occupied parts of Donbas, a settlement over the future of Crimea, financial compensation for the damage it has inflicted, prosecution of individuals who have committed war crimes (Ukraine’s prosecutor general has already registered more than 8,000 suspected cases), the prospect of EU membership for Ukraine, and the creation of viable Nato-compatible armed forces that can defend the country in a coalition of willing nations. What would defeat look like? Put simply, anything that results in a long-term simmering conflict that locks Ukraine in a grey zone of instability. An inconclusive outcome that still gives Russia an upper hand to conquer and annex more territory is unacceptable. The Kremlin is planning a new annexation of the Kherson region under the name of North Tavriya. Kyiv’s official recognition of Putin’s territorial gains at gunpoint would lead to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s political demise and further endanger the Ukrainian state. Victory won’t be easy, but Ukrainians increasingly believe they can achieve it. That confidence, which seemed like lunacy at the start of the war, has been vindicated by combat success and the total mobilisation of Ukrainian society. This has convinced key western allies that “Ukraine can win”. The UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, resolutely stated that “we will keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine”. Ukraine’s objectives coincide with those of its allies. More to the point, those goals are now backed by a newly approved Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act under which the US government will allocate $33bn, mostly for military support. A coalition of 40 countries has set up a permanent defence advisory group to coordinate this assistance. Ukraine must defeat Russia in what, after all, should be considered a colonial war. The restoration of Ukrainian territorial integrity and, ultimately, peace will mean the collapse of Putinism as a doctrine and an end to Russian claims to territorial dominance elsewhere in eastern Europe and Central Asia. Demonstrating that a “gathering of historic Russian lands” is doomed to failure is the only solid basis for sustainable peace and security in Europe. Ukraine’s victory would also prevent future wars. Russia uses newly conquered territories to stage further conflicts. Annexed Crimea was indispensable for its military operation in Syria, and now for its assaults on Mariupol and Kherson. The breakaway entity of Transnistria in Moldova, propped up for decades by Russia, is a de-facto arms depot, with a military base that could be used to attack Odesa. Belarus is already being used to launch missiles on Kyiv. Let’s not forget we’re also talking about the world’s food system. A Ukrainian victory would reduce the risk of a mass famine. The lifting of sanctions in response to a full Russian withdrawal from Ukraine would also lead to a more stable and predictable Russian economy. Ukraine and Russia are critical suppliers of food across much of the global south. In some countries, such as Somalia, Russia and Ukraine account for 100% of wheat imports. The UN projects that 8-20 million people will now be left hungry from the knock-on effects of soaring prices and broken supply chains for grain, cooking oil, fertiliser and fuel. Settling this war in a sustainable way means millions of Ukrainians will be able to return home, lifting the burden of caring from countries that host them. More than 5 million people are scattered across European cities and the bill for supporting them is €17bn. Most are desperate to return home. And Ukraine needs these people for its future modernisation and economic growth. The outcome of this war will either lead to a brighter future or bog down millions of people in struggle and misery – and not only in Ukraine. That is why we must give Ukraine’s victory a fighting chance.

5/3/2022,"The way we talk about the great migration is often oversimplified, limiting it to the movement of Black Americans from the rural south to the urban north through the early and mid 20th century. But there are many more stories of the great migration than just this one. The new joint exhibition between the Mississippi Museum of Art and the Baltimore Museum of Art, A Movement in Every Direction seeks to complicate that tidy narrative through freshly commissioned artwork that adds new stories to the great migration, and explores how it continues to this day. Ryan Dennis, co-curator of the exhibit and Chief Curator of the Mississippi Museum of Art, told me that, “our vision for the show was to think more expansively about the great migration and to its deep connections to the south”. Revising predominating narratives of this massive exodus, Dennis believed that “it was really important to move away from the deep trauma connected to the great migration and to think more about how self-determined agency and possibility were a part of the story”. To that end, A Movement in Every Direction shows new work in various media by 12 celebrated artists, including Carrie Mae Weems, Mark Bradford and Theaster Gates Jr. The show opened at the Mississippi Museum of Art in April, and in the fall it will travel to the Baltimore Museum of Art, opening there on 30 October 2022. Bradford’s attention-grabbing piece 500 consists of 60 individually painted and oxidized paper-on-wood panels. From afar, 500 looks to be an abstract mass of blacks and ochers, but closer examination reveals that each of its 60 panels is in fact a reproduction of a 1913 advertisement reading “WANTED” across the top, recruiting settlers to the Black-established farming town of Blackdom, New Mexico. Incorporated in 1903 by 13 African Americans, the town briefly flourished during the 1910s, before eventually declining and emptying out amid the Great Depression. Bradford’s 500 has a rustic, time-ravaged feel, the process of oxidation rendering each individual panel only partially legible. It conjures curiosity about the individuals who may have seen this advertisement, the mixture of emotions they felt as they contemplated transforming their lives entirely through the arduous work of traveling out west and building a new settlement. A sense of time and history also sits layered on to this work, the panels connoting the gulf of a century that separates us from those migrants, even as it raises contemporary questions about who the descendants of these individuals are and where they are living their lives, probably in drastically different circumstances than their ancestors. Contrasting with the deeply rooted historicism of 500 is artist Leslie Hewitt’s tryptich of abstract low-rise sculptures, Untitled (Slow Drag, Barely Moving, Imperceptible), placed throughout the exhibit. The title of these pieces brings to mind the very slow, lengthy rhythms associated with long-term migrations, particularly in the era before modern means of transportation. Their strangeness can evoke displacement among museum-goers, yet they also offer viewers a moment of familiarity – as the exhibition co-curator and curator at the Baltimore Museum of Art, Jessica Bell Brown, told me, “Leslie uses materials that connect her to her family’s ancestral origin in Macon, Georgia. So the materials create this sort of abstraction for visitors, but when you look at the work it immediately reminds you of this domestic space, a deep sense of connection to space.” Brown saw Hewitt’s sculptures as connecting with Zoë Charlton’s large-scale pop-up collage, Permanent Change of Station, which features an enormous wall drawing of a lush landscape behind multiple pop-up-book-like plants collaged together in the foreground. Although the work leans heavily into the natural splendor that is so essential in defining places, its title calls back to the influence of the military in her family’s life, which caused Charlton’s family to migrate throughout the globe. Brown told me that, “in this piece, Zoë is thinking about her family’s origins in the Florida panhandle, as well as so-called foreign landscapes where her family spent so much time in military service. Looking at Zoë’s incredible installation, it’s phenomenal to me that artists like her and Leslie are speaking to each other through their family stories.” With the breadth of work on offer in A Movement in Every Direction, it is clear that Dennis and Brown are trying to position the great migration in a very broad sense, as a complicated phenomenon that can hold many meanings at once. This show is important in that it aspires to put agency back into the story of the great migration, as well as engage with the larger story of how Black individuals have found their homes in the US. Dennis sees migration as “movement and possibility, something that has a really deep impact on Black folks, both in this country and globally. It looks into how people need to move about to protect themselves and allow for a deeper rootedness in the world, and to think about how they need to move for their families.” Brown added that, “when I think about all the artists in the show, I think about migration as a sense of radical possibility”. Curating A Movement in Every Direction has also been a very personally rewarding experience for Dennis and Brown. Dennis shared that by collaborating on the show they have “created a friendship that will last a lifetime”. In addition, as Black women with their own connections to the Black community, they found that working on the show gave them space to open up questions of their own personal and family histories. Dennis told me that curating the show, “allowed me to ask more questions of my family and to understand their origin story and movement in a way that I just hadn’t before. It’s been inspiring to really just share this exhibition with my nieces and nephews, who have been encouraged to talk to their great-aunts about just their lives.” Adding to that, Brown said, “there’s a deep deep relevance in this exhibition in that it opens up the opportunity for so many folks to open up their family legacies and to open up how they tell stories”. Indeed, so far A Movement in Every Direction has been doing just that. According to Dennis, in the two years that she’s worked with the Mississippi Museum of Art, she’s never seen so many people of color come in to see an exhibit. That’s particularly important since Jackson, where the museum is located, is 85% Black. For Dennis, seeing the public’s response to the show has “been really phenomenal. People in Jackson can see themselves reflected in the work and the narrative of the show, and so they have really showed up.” A Movement in Every Direction is now on at the Mississippi Museum of Art before moving to the Baltimore Museum of Art on 30 October",Arts/Art and design,‘A sense of radical possibility’: re-examining the great migration through art,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/02/re-examining-us-great-migration-through-art
5/3/2022,"Some in the music industry were unsurprised when the allegations about the DJ Tim Westwood came to light last week. There had long been stories recounted by Black women of his alleged abuse of power – rumours that circulated among friends in Black nightlife and the music industry. An investigation by the BBC and the Guardian details the accounts of multiple Black women, some teenagers at the time – of alleged predatory behaviour and groping on the part of the veteran DJ. Some claim to have been groped at his shows, while others maintain that they were enticed to a flat on the promise of professional guidance, only to be abused. In 2020, a Twitter account was created, named Surviving Tim Westwood and a hashtag of the same name started to trend. Then the account disappeared, perhaps due to Westwood’s legal team, as he has denied all the allegations. However it was also possibly indicative of a deep-seated truth: that Black women’s voices are often silenced. This is just one example of how misogynoir, the term used to describe misogyny specifically directed at Black women, may have aided and abetted Westwood in avoiding accountability until now.Westwood was a deified figure within Black music – beloved by party-goers as well as industry gatekeepers. Many people, especially Black men, credit him with giving hip-hop and rap music that would otherwise have been relegated to the underground a mainstream platform. What is telling about that argument is how Westwood’s negligible influence in a culture that is far bigger than him is treated as more important than the allegations made by Black women. So, while the powerful, predominantly white, industry executives who continued to employ him as those allegations swirled should be held accountable, there is clearly an intraracial gender issue here, too – namely that Black women’s stories were diminished in order to justify Westwood’s standing in Black culture overall. Colourism plays a part too. Beauty standards exalt lily-white or racially ambiguous women – so it may well have seemed impossible to many that a powerful man such as Westwood could desire these dark-skinned women. Perhaps it was the presumed undesirability of dark-skinned women that allowed him to allegedly pursue them in a covert manner, without alarm bells ringing. Meanwhile, the fetishisation and hypersexualisation of Black women flourished on his shows – as it does elsewhere in a culture in which the mere expression of our sexuality is seen as an invitation. In 2016, Cardi B was a guest on his YouTube channel, TimWestoodTV. When she asked “do you have sex with a lot of Black women?” he responded “not as much as I’d like to … but we could rectify that”. While #MeToo and #Time’sUp felt like moments of real accountability for lecherous men, the movements felt whitewashed. Meanwhile Tarana Burke’s decades-long work with survivors of sexual abuse, during which she originated the phrase Me Too, went uncredited. It’s difficult to tell whether there has been substantial change within the music industry. Despite confidential conversations among ourselves, women are still reluctant to speak out about the sexual inappropriateness they’ve faced, not only for fear of not being believed, but for their jobs. On the rare occasions that they do report their accounts, non-disclosure agreements can further silence them. This is what makes the recorded testimonies of these Black women so profound; the hope is that they will break through the wall of silence that protects alleged abusers within the music industry. The limitations that #MeToo exposed potentially led to a better understanding of the complexity of issues that affect Black women – and it certainly feels as if there are more light-skinned and white people who want to be better allies. But it is imperative that women of all races and shades band together because the hypervisibility of dark-skinned Black women, of whom there are so few in public life, leaves them particularly exposed to racism and misogyny. Black musicians are beginning to find their voice in tackling this. Recently the singer Ari Lennox was asked “is someone fucking you good right now?” by a South African radio broadcaster. She visibly recoiled and asked: “Why ask it in that way?” In the past, a Black woman might have felt the need to parry this kind of question the way Cardi B did with Westwood, but, by reacting in the way that she did, Lennox was able to set an example that our boundaries are to be respected. Malcolm X once said: “The most disrespected woman in America is the Black woman.” This is still applicable now, and beyond America. It’s promising that Westwood has stepped down from his slot at Capital Xtra until further notice, but there is still a long way to go. By “protect Black women”, we mean protect us all – not just the ones we’re taught to believe are deserving.

5/3/2022,"The UK home secretary, Priti Patel, is facing mass legal action over delays that have left thousands of Ukrainians at risk of trauma and Russian bombs, or in limbo in eastern Europe. A class action lawsuit is being prepared on behalf of hundreds of Ukrainians who applied to travel to the UK weeks ago but whose cases have been stuck in a “chaotic” visa backlog, the Guardian has learned. Charities including Save the Children and the Refugee Council said the Homes for Ukraine programme must be overhauled urgently as it was endangering vulnerable children and adding “trauma on top of existing trauma” since Russia’s invasion. The chronic delays have been compounded by the Home Office approving many visas but failing to notify the successful applicants. The government admitted on Thursday it was aware of the problem after MPs from the across the Commons raised concerns about families waiting up to five weeks for news of their application. According to the latest government figures, 59,000 people have had visas approved but have not yet arrived in the UK. Only 15% of the 74,700 Ukrainians who applied under the sponsorship route have made it to Britain. A large number of those who have not yet arrived will be people waiting for other family members to receive their visas before travelling; children’s applications usually take longer because the UK requires them to undergo security scans if they do not have their own international passport. However, a significant proportion of the 59,000 Ukrainians will be people who have had visas approved but have not been informed of the approval. Amanda Jones, an immigration and public law barrister, has been instructed to launch legal proceedings on behalf of “many hundreds” of Ukrainians, in litigation organised by members of the groups Vigil for Visas and Taking Action Over the Homes for Ukraine Visa Delays. This could include mounting a judicial review case against the Home Office. Legal action is also being prepared on behalf of lone children who have been unable to access foster placements set up for them in the UK due to the visa delays. Anaïs Crane, a case worker at Wilsons Solicitors who is working with Here For Good Ukraine Project and representing several unaccompanied Ukrainian children, said they had been waiting longer than a month for a decision and were starting to give up hope. “Many of them are now considering returning to Ukraine due to their precarious situations in Europe,” she said. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, described the delay between visas being approved and sent out as “inexplicable and disgraceful” and urged the Home Office to disclose how many people had been affected and what steps it was taking to address the problem. She added: “For families who have already fled war zones to then be stuck in limbo even longer because the Home Office can’t even get its act together to notify people when the visas have been granted is appalling. Long delays are making families more vulnerable to exploitation.” Kirsty McNeill, an executive director at Save the Children and a former Downing Street adviser, said the red tape was increasing the danger for some of the 1.5 million children who had fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion on 24 February. She said: “Part of [the government’s] argument for the bureaucracy and the slowness is that it is keeping people safe. But actually it’s a lack of pace that is endangering children more than anything.” The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, said stories of women and children being stuck in dangerous situation were the “dreadful but inevitable consequence” of an approach that was “flawed from the start”. He said: “Responding to what is clearly a serious humanitarian crisis with two visa routes … was always going to result in paper and bureaucracy being put before people and their needs. Tragically, we are now witnessing the fallout of that approach.” The International Rescue Committee said the UK was “an outlier” in Europe for requiring those fleeing war to apply for visas before they arrive. Ireland, which does not require visas for arrivals, has taken in roughly the same number of Ukrainians as the UK despite its population being a thirteenth of the size of Britain’s. A government spokesperson said: “In response to Putin’s barbaric invasion we launched one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history. Over 86,000 visas have been issued so Ukrainians can live and work in the UK. “The changes the Home Office has made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff numbers, are working and we are now processing visas as quickly as they come in – enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes.”",News/UK news,Priti Patel faces legal action from Ukrainians stuck in visa backlog,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/02/priti-patel-refugees-legal-action-homes-for-ukraine
5/3/2022,"It has been four weeks since 12-year-old Diana Demchyna was taken in darkness across the Ukrainian border to Poland on the first leg of her journey to Britain. Her parents, who cannot leave Ukraine due to their work, had arranged for Diana to live with her relative, Olenka Pevny, in the UK until the war was over. Pevny, a professor at the University of Cambridge, was assured twice by the Home Office that Diana would be able to come to Britain under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. She filed the paperwork on 24 March and flew to Poland the following week to collect her young relative. They have been waiting there ever since. Diana’s application is among tens of thousands stuck in a byzantine system that charities say is worsening the trauma of those fleeing war. Pevny, 58, said she faced the prospect of having to send Diana back to Ukraine as she could no longer afford to stay in Poland. “It cannot be right for a 12-year-old girl to leave a war zone and then, because the UK has a glitch in their visa scheme, have to go back to a war zone where Russians are committing war crimes against children and mothers,” she said. “We’re reading about all these mothers and children, who are Diana’s age, who are being raped around Kyiv. Can I actually as a human being return this child to Ukraine?” Pevny was told twice by the Home Office to apply to host Diana under the Homes for Ukraine scheme because, as a distant relative, she would not qualify as a close family member, although they are incredibly close as families and celebrate all their holidays together. But weeks after submitting an application under Homes for Ukraine, she found out that the rules had changed so that unaccompanied under-18s could not be brought to Britain. The safeguarding reasons behind this may be sound, but the change was not publicised or communicated to Pevny, who only found out when her MP, Daniel Zeichner, looked into her case. She now faces another long wait as her application is rerouted to the family scheme, with no prospect of success. Pevny said Diana was “traumatised” by the process: “She thinks that the UK does not want her. She thinks that I will leave her in Poland or send her back to the war zone. There must be a better way for the UK to help innocent children who are victims of the Russian war of aggression.” Charlie Richards, a market research consultant, has found himself managing visa applications on behalf of 22 Ukrainians who fled their homeland when Russia invaded. The group consists of six families of people aged from three years old to 70. They are scattered across Europe as they approach their sixth week of waiting for the green light to travel to the UK. Richards, 35, discovered on 4 April that more than half of his 22 applicants had been approved for visas but had not received them. He learned this only because Home Office officials visited a Ukrainian cultural centre near his home in Reading, so he asked them to check the status of their applications. They had been approved, some weeks ago, but never sent. He was astonished; the Home Office officials looked concerned. They came back four days later after looking into the issue. “They recognised it was a problem,” Richards said. The government only officially acknowledged the problem on Thursday, the day parliament was prorogued. Potentially thousands of people could have arrived in the UK weeks ago if their visas had been dispatched as soon as they had been approved. Three of Richards’ cases received visas 16 days after they were authorised. But that family are still in limbo halfway across Europe because three of their group are still waiting for their paperwork. Richards said the UK had “fundamentally let down a group of people we should have been there for as a country”. He added: “When you see that tens of thousands of people have supposedly been granted visas but haven’t got here yet, it’s impossible not to think the problem could be that widespread.” Alexandra, a Ukrainian refugee, said she was at a loss to understand why she has had to wait six weeks for a straightforward visa application to be processed. She fled Kherson and her visa application was lodged on the day the scheme opened, 18 March. “I feel like it’s a joke and a game from government for us,” she said. “It makes me so mad, the suspense and zero information. I don’t think they realise what we have been through.” Since fleeing Kherson with only her passport and a few items of clothing, Alexandra has been on a dangerous journey passing through Russia, Turkey and Bulgaria to get to Romania, where she is waiting for her visa to come through. A home is waiting for her in Warwickshire, where she has been sponsored by Daniel Edwards. But still the wait goes on. “I’ve exhausted so many different options trying to get in touch with MPs, the Home Office helpline, the visa office but there are still no results and no hope,” said Edwards. “The woman I’m sponsoring has been on such a dangerous journey from border to border. The visa should have arrived at least four weeks ago. It’s an absolute disgrace that it’s now more than 40 days since the original application.”",News/UK news,"‘No results, no hope’: Homes for Ukraine glitches lock refugees out of UK",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/02/homes-for-ukraine-glitches-lock-refugees-out-of-uk
5/3/2022,"You wouldn’t think it possible to commit armed robbery accidentally. But that’s exactly what happens to poor clueless Martin when he gets into an altercation with an attendant at a petrol station while dressed as a Viking in animal furs, with axe in hand. Martin has run away to the snow-capped mountains to hunt, forage and find the meaning of life. The snag is that his survival skills are more Alan Partridge than Bear Grylls – hence the foray to the petrol station for beer and crisps. The Danish film-maker Thomas Daneskov’s deadpan midlife-crisis comedy has some brilliantly absurd moments such as this. Rasmus Bjerg plays Martin, who has tried half-marathons and road cycling, but still feels dead inside. Telling his long-suffering wife, Anne (The Killing’s Sofie Gråbøl), that he’s off to a team-building seminar, Martin instead heads to Norway to play out his Viking fantasies. Bjerg’s performance is pitch perfect, playing it deliciously straight as this gormless bumbler, who goes full Fred Flintstone with his ridiculous animal-pelt costume but can’t bear to part with his iPhone. Daneskov frames Bjerg’s great big, expressive face in front of the icily majestic landscape for maximum comedy. Martin has been living as the world’s worst Viking for about a week and has just robbed the petrol station when he stumbles across Musa (Zaki Youssef), a weed smuggler injured in a car crash. It’s about here that the police get involved and the movie turns Fargo-ish. Bjørn Sundquist is terrific as Øyvind, a retirement-age police chief with Jack Nicholson eyebrows and a fondness for fly fishing. Whenever he asks for the police sniffer dog, Øyvind gets the same answer: it’s the mutt’s day off. There are some very funny scenes and a reasonably tense shootout finale – though the sentimental ending felt to me like a bit of a cop-out. And it’s a shame that Gråbøl (wearing a rubbish jumper) is lumbered with a nothing-interesting role as Martin’s wait-behind wife.

5/3/2022,"Mark Cavendish is unlikely to get the chance to break Eddy Merckx’s stage-win record at the Tour de France this year after it was confirmed that he has been selected in his team’s squad for the Giro d’Italia. The Manx rider unexpectedly equalled Merckx’s mark of 34 wins with four victories in the 2021 edition of the race but the decision of his Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl team to send him to the Giro, which begins in Budapest on Friday, is almost certain to mean he will not be picked for the Tour in July. Cavendish, who will turn 37 this month, could still find a spot for the grand départ – which this year takes place in Denmark – but presumably only if injury rules out Quick-Step’s other elite sprinter, Fabio Jakobsen. Jakobsen had said in January that he was targeting the Tour, while Cavendish was likely to ride the Giro. Cavendish’s quartet of Tour victories in 2021 were all the more remarkable given he had not won a Tour stage since 2016 and had been through years of illness and depression. He would not have featured in the race at all if it were not for an injury to the team’s then top sprinter Sam Bennett, and his call-up came just days before the start of the race. Any hope of breaking Merckx’s record may require fate to intervene once more. “We go to the Giro d’Italia with a lot of motivation,” Quick-Step’s sports director, Davide Bramati, told Eurosport. “We have a good team at the start, with Mark as our man for the flat. He has won a lot of stages at the Giro, and he can rely on many strong riders to support and guide him in the hectic bunch sprints.” Cavendish also has an enviable record in the Giro, winning 15 stages between 2008 and 2013.",Sport/Sport,Cavendish likely to miss Tour de France after being picked for Giro d’Italia,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/02/mark-cavendish-likely-to-miss-tour-de-france-after-being-picked-for-giro-ditalia
5/3/2022,"Covid cases are rising in South Africa. But how serious is this and what might it mean for the UK? The country is seeing a wave of Covid infections linked to two new forms, or “sub-lineages”, of Omicron: BA.4 and BA.5. Dr Nicole Wolter of South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases, said the wave is possibly due to BA.4 and BA.5 having mutations in the spike protein leading the virus being able to dodge the body’s immunity to some degree, as well as waning immunity from previous waves. “In addition, we have had a relaxing of restrictions , as well as moving into winter and therefore experiencing colder temperatures,” she said. BA.4 and BA.5 have now been found in Europe and the UK – albeit it at low levels – as well as other countries. Wolter said work is ongoing to understand their characteristics. “While there has been a slight increase in hospitalisations recently, this is from a very low baseline and currently we do not have any evidence to suggest that these new sub-lineages will be more severe than other Omicron sub-lineages,” she said. Sub-lineages of Omicron include BA.1, which took off in the UK towards the end of 2021, and BA.2, which now dominates in the UK. Wolter added South Africa has high immunity because of previous infection and vaccination, and this protects against the risk of developing severe Covid with BA.1. “There is currently no indication that this will change with BA.4/BA.5, however the situation will continue to be monitored closely,” she said. However research, not yet peer-reviewed, from a team including Prof Alex Sigal from the University of KwaZulu-Natal, found unvaccinated people who have previously had BA.1 have little protection against infection with BA.4 or BA.5. By contrast, those who previously had BA.1 and were vaccinated had much better protection. Another preprint, from a team including Prof Tulio de Oliveira, director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation at Stellenbosch University, suggests BA.4 and BA.5 have identical spike proteins, and appear to have a similar growth advantage over BA.2 as BA.2 had over BA.1 – although some say it is too soon to estimate this. Wolter noted is difficult to say how different countries may be affected as they have different levels of immunity. Indeed the UK had a long BA.2 wave, and has higher levels of vaccination than South Africa. “South Africa was different, as [it]did not have a second Omicron wave and the previous immunity of BA.1 is probably waining,” said de Oliveira. Prof Tom Wenseleers of KU Leuven, also pointed to the spread of BA.2 in Europe. “Given that BA.4 [and] BA.5 are genetically very close to BA.2, the hope is that our immunity against infection with BA.4 [and] BA.5 could be somewhat better and that these variants would have a smaller advantage and would cause a smaller wave over here than in [South Africa],” he said. Prof Christina Pagel of UCL added that the UK is approaching summer, meaning more outdoor mixing and lower levels of transmission, although Covid restrictions have been removed, there is waning immunity from vaccination, and hardly any community testing. “I think [it is] very likely [BA.4 and BA.5] will become dominant here,” she said, adding at best it will be a small wave and at worse similar to those of BA.1 and BA.2, noting that could put strain on the NHS, disrupt education and jobs, and cause more long Covid. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said vaccinated populations are in a good position as Covid jabs offer long-lasting protection against severe disease, with boosters potentially helpful for those at higher risk – although discussions are needed about the best approach to future boosters. Prof Tim Colbourn of UCL suggested it would be good to switch to an Omicron-specific vaccine , although current jabs still protect against severe outcomes. But Pollard noted the high rate of Omicron infection, and hence immunity against it, means it is increasingly likely future spread will involve a new variant. “If the new variant was similar to Omicron, an Omicron vaccine might be a rational choice, but it is difficult to predict today which variant will be upon us next and thus not obvious which variant or variants to include in a vaccine,” he said. According to Wenseleers, the situation in South Africa suggests endemic Covid may involve a significant wave every six months – although the impact may depend on how boosters are rolled out or updated, and levels of natural immunity. But not everyone agrees. “While we can so far be sure that Covid is here to stay, it is not yet clear where viral transmission rates will settle in terms of the level, spikiness or frequency of spread,” said Pollard. “We certainly can’t predict a seasonal or periodic pattern yet.”",News/World news,What might rising Covid cases in South Africa mean for the UK?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/covid-cases-south-africa-omicron-ba4-ba5-uk
5/3/2022,"Boris Johnson is considering reviving Margaret Thatcher’s right-to-buy scheme by giving people the chance to purchase the properties they rent from housing associations at a discounted price. The idea, designed to help “generation rent” and prove the government is still committed to its Conservative principles amid unrest from some backbenchers, is being worked up by officials in the No 10 policy unit, with reports that up to 2.5 million households could become eligible to buy their homes at a discount of up to 70%. But housing experts warned the policy amounted to the sell-off of affordable homes during the cost-of-living crisis and called instead for an increase in housebuilding. Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, criticised the “hare-brained idea” as “the opposite of what the country needs”. Ministers are also considering whether to allow banks to take into account taxpayer money received by those who claim housing benefit when they are seeking a mortgage. To help boost housing stocks, the government is contemplating axing the rule that developers must build a set number of affordable homes in favour of making them pay into an infrastructure fund that councils can then use to fund their own projects. Housing reforms have fallen by the wayside after the government backed down in the face of a huge backlash from Tory MPs over changes to planning rules. The Daily Telegraph cited a source saying Johnson was “very excited” about rejuvenating Thatcher’s right-to-buy policy, with the roughly 2.5 million households living in housing association property becoming eligible to buy their homes. Right to buy became one of the legacy decisions of Thatcher’s era and allowed council tenants to purchase their properties at a discounted rate. Critics, however, rounded on the policy, which they said would only worsen the country’s shortage of affordable housing. Shelter said that in the last three months of 2021, nearly 34,000 households in England became homeless, more than 8,000 of them families with children. Neate said: “There could not be a worse time to sell off what remains of our last truly affordable social homes. The living cost crisis means more people are on the brink of homelessness than homeownership … “Right to buy has already torn a massive hole in our social housing stock as less than 5% of the homes sold off have ever been replaced. These half-baked plans have been tried before and they’ve failed.” More than 1 million households are stuck on social housing waiting lists in England according to the charity, and at a time when bills were skyrocketing, Neate said the government “should be building more social homes, so we have more not less”. The housing expert Henry Pryor suggested the Conservatives were trying to bribe voters with a taxpayer-subsidised sale of housing association stock. About half the homes previously bought under right to buy are let out for higher rents in the private sector, with thousands of rents being subsidised by the taxpayer, he said. There were long waiting lists for social housing because the government had failed to replace the previous homes sold off under right to buy, he added. “It’s social gerrymandering, tempting people with a chance to make a few quid at the expense of the rest of us and, more importantly, those who really need affordable homes.” In 2015, the idea of selling off swathes of housing association properties was resurrected by David Cameron’s government. At the time, Johnson was London mayor and was lukewarm about the policy. He told the London assembly: “One of the issues … is that it would be potentially extremely costly to this body. We would have to make up the difference. Housing associations are private bodies, as we all know. It would involve massive subsidies. We would need to get the funds to support that.” A housing association right-to-buy scheme was piloted in 2018 in the Midlands and the Conservatives’ last election manifesto said they would consider new pilots, but no more have been pursued. Critics have said many of the decent housing association properties have already been sold off and the remaining ones would not be a tempting purchase to current tenants. “They need some new ideas,” one Tory source complained. Given the cost of living crisis, it is also possible that prices for housing association properties remain too high for many struggling households.
