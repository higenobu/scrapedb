4/14/2022,"The screenwriter and novelist Frank Cottrell-Boyce texted me this week with an idea: “You need to write a piece about the dilemma of trying to create a bubble of prayer around the days of the Triduum while having tickets for the semi-final in London with no direct trains, so no chance of getting back for the Easter vigil.” And when a writer of Frank’s calibre suggests I write something, write that something I will. As Frank knows, he’s pushing at an open door here. Like him, I’m both a devotee of a football club and an enthusiastic Roman Catholic. Where we differ is that his team, Liverpool, are wildly successful; my team, West Brom, aren’t. Also, his learning in matters of the church surpasses mine by a distance. I had to look up Triduum, for a start. My dictionary says it is: “A period of prayer or religious celebration lasting three days.” It’s also defined, secularly, as merely “a space of three days”. And here lies the problem: in this particular space of three – OK, four – days, many critical football matches will be played. Over the Easter weekend, the secular and the devotional clash like clanging bells. While Liverpool and Manchester City do battle in their FA Cup semi-final, football fans of all stripes up and down the country will be going through the mill. With the end of the season imminent, their prospects of promotion or relegation will be clearer after not one but two matches over the long weekend. If you’re into football, there’s arguably no worse weekend on which to seek peace and reflection. Easter services, from Good Friday to Easter Sunday, lack for nothing in beauty and drama. But neither, let’s be honest, do they lack for length. In football parlance, they go on well into injury time, extra time and even penalties. That’s a lot of time in which a footballing mind can wander. I confess to you, my brothers and sisters, that during Easter services, this sinner’s mind has on occasion drifted away from the sacred. While I swear I’ve never resorted to actual prayer in the hope of influencing results, my thoughts have gone there. I ask for forgiveness and understanding in those difficult times. For the truly devout, these anxieties are not just for Easter; they nag away all season. It was once my privilege on a train from Manchester to sit next to Bernard Halford, Manchester City’s long-serving club secretary and life president, who died in 2019. I already knew about his long service to the club, but on this journey, he also shared with me his enthusiasm for the Catholic church. When I asked him what he did when there were fixture clashes in his football and faith calendars, he looked pained. I may be doing him a disservice here, but the impression I got was that football tended to win out. Importantly, though, it was clear he was tortured about this, as every good Catholic tends to be about one thing or another. Bless him, a very nice man. This Easter will be different for me. Hitherto, over all 16 Easters I’ve had since I became a Catholic, West Brom have been heading either for promotion or just missing out on it, or for relegation or a narrow escape from it. Not this year. We have nothing to play for, so a dismayed kind of peace can finally envelope me this Easter. I will be able to focus properly on matters spiritual at last. Perhaps it’s not cleanliness but mediocrity that is second to godliness; I am blessed, unlike poor Frank Cottrell-Boyce, to support a team going nowhere.

4/14/2022,"The Dutch bank ABN Amro has apologised for its predecessors’ role in the slave trade, after it commissioned an investigation into the “untold suffering” it caused. The investigation, by academics at the International Institute of Social History (IISH), an Amsterdam archive, found that two of ABN Amro’s predecessor companies were involved in either financing the operation of slave plantations directly, or underwriting the trade in products produced by slaves. The global Black Lives Matter protests that followed the murder of George Floyd, a US citizen, in 2020 prompted many historical institutions to re-examine their own links to the trade. The Netherlands and other global imperial powers including the UK were deeply involved in the enslavement of millions of people over centuries, and the profits derived from their labour helped to finance the construction of some of Europe’s grandest cities. In the UK the Bank of England, Barclays, HSBC and Lloyd’s of London were among the still extant companies with direct or indirect links to the trade. ABN Amro was itself formerly owned by Royal Bank of Scotland (now NatWest Group), which has also found separate links to slavery. The slave trade was abolished in the Netherlands in 1863. Slavery in Britain became illegal in 1772 and the slave trade in the British empire was abolished in 1807. The two predecessor companies to ABN Amro with links to slavery were Hope & Co, which was “actively involved in the day-to-day business of plantations”, and Mees en Zoonen, which brokered insurance for slave ships and shipments of goods harvested by enslaved people. Both became part of ABN Amro in 2010 after a series of mergers and acquisitions. The bank said Hope & Co “played a pivotal role in the international slave economy of the 18th century”, in a statement published on Wednesday. A previous study had already found that ABN Amro predecessors were involved in slavery in the US. Robert Swaak, ABN Amro’s chief executive, said: “ABN Amro has a proud history going back more than 300 years. However, we must also recognise that it has a darker side as well. ABN Amro as it exists now cannot undo that period of its history. We are aware that, even though slavery has been abolished, the past injustices have persisted. “ABN Amro apologises for the past actions and activities of these predecessors and for the pain and suffering that they caused.” Dr Pepijn Brandon, a senior researcher at the IISH, said: “Hope & Co was the largest financial and commercial company in the Netherlands at the end of the 18th century, and slavery-related operations formed a core part of its business. While Mees & Zoonen was smaller, slavery was an intrinsic part of that firm’s operations as well. “Decisions made in offices in Amsterdam and Rotterdam directly impacted the lives of thousands of enslaved persons.”",News/Business,ABN Amro apologises for historical links to slavery,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/13/abn-amro-apologises-for-historical-links-to-slavery
4/14/2022,"In the last 10 years of the old European Cup, before the establishment of Big Cup in 1992, seven clubs won the trophy for the first time in their existence: Hamburg, Juventus, Steaua Bucharest, Porto, PSV, Red Star and Barcelona. The following five years, when Big Cup was still a champions-only affair, another two newbies won the biggest prize of all: Marseille and Borussia Dortmund. But since Big Cup went real big, throwing the doors open to all and sundry (providing they’re big), only one more club has broken through, and they had to meet the oligarch at the crossroads to do it. It’s not been for the want of trying, though, and plenty of clubs searching for that elusive first victory have made it as far as the final. Valencia and Atlético Madrid have taken repeated tilts, the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals to Big Cup’s Super Bowl. Bayer Leverkusen, Monaco and Arsenal enlivened the noughties, and the latter might even have won their final had Jens Lehmann not been running around in the Hyperactive Toddler + Sunny D x Jordan Pickford style. And the last three finals have also featured clubs trying to land their maiden Big Cup, it says on a list, although The Fiver is yet to see conclusive proof that any of Spurs, PSG and Manchester City actually turned up on the day. We remain sceptical. But perhaps this could be the year for another long-awaited breakthrough. The draw opened up nicely on Tuesday night, as tiny Villarreal rammed Bayern TV’s words – “It’s a very manageable draw [laughs, tee hee, guffaw, now for a feast]” – back down their entitled gullet, while Real Madrid saw off Chelsea in a classic that Christian Pulisic could have won from six yards out, three times over. Admittedly, Madrid have won Big Cup on 13 occasions, but the state of that defence gives Atlético or City a much better chance of making it to the final, which any romantic worth their salt will hope also features the Yellow Submarine. Only the second first-time winner in the last quarter of a century would then be guaranteed! Yay!

4/14/2022,"For the first time the world is in a position to limit global heating to under 2C, according to the first in-depth analysis of the net zero pledges made by nations at the UN Cop26 climate summit in December. Before these pledges it was more than likely that at the peak of the climate crisis there would be a temperature rise above 2C, bringing more severe impacts for billions of people. Now it is more likely that the peak temperature rise will be about 1.9C. However, the researchers said this depended on all nations implementing their pledges on time and in full, and warned that the policies to do so were not in place. The pledges also include those that developing countries have said will not happen without more financial and technical support. Achieving the pledges needed for the 2C limit was a “historic milestone” and good news, the scientists said. However, they said the bad news was that the cuts in global emissions currently planned by 2030 were way off track to keep the peak below 1.5C. That is the global goal, but currently there is less than a 10% chance of hitting that target. People across the planet are already facing intensifying heatwaves, floods and storms with the 1.2 C of heating caused by humanity’s emissions to date, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned in 2018 of far worse if heating continues above 1.5C. The 2C limit being within reach was “big news”, said Christophe McGlade at the International Energy Agency, a member of the team behind the new analysis. “It’s the first time that governments have come forward with specific targets that can hold global warming to below the symbolic 2C level.” “These results are clearly a cause for optimism,” he added. “We’ve come a long way since the Paris agreement was signed back in 2015. But now the real work has to start. The pledges have not yet been backed up by the strong and credible near-term policies needed to make them a reality.” Prof Malte Meinshausen, at the University of Melbourne, Australia, another team member, said having the 2C limit in sight was a “historic milestone”. But he said: “Our study also clearly shows that increased action this decade is necessary. Otherwise, we’re going to blast through the remaining carbon budget for 1.5C.” A major IPCC report earlier in April said global emissions must peak and start to fall within 30 months to keep the 1.5C target alive. The new analysis, published in the journal Nature, is the first peer-reviewed study to assess the peak temperature rise that would result from countries fulfilling their pledges. It used two independent modelling approaches, one of which assessed more than 1,400 different scenarios and included recent pledges on shipping and aviation emissions. By the end of Cop26, 153 nations had submitted new climate pledges to the UN, with countries responsible for 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions committing to reach net zero between 2050 and 2070. These have made the 2C limit a possibility, though the scientists warned that uncertainties about how the planet responds to rising emissions meant there remained a 5% chance of a temperature above 2.8C. The climate policies actually in place today would mean a peak of about 2.6C, leading to “massive climate damages around the world”, said McGlade. The commitments made by countries so far up to 2030 only cut that peak to 2.4C. The IPCC has said that limiting heating to 1.5C requires reducing CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 compared with 2010. But emissions were on track to rise by 7-15% by 2030, a “sobering assessment”, the scientists said, with any delay in action putting 1.5C “out of reach”. If the world does overshoot this target, then ensuring a “livable future” would rely on a massive rollout of technology that can suck CO2 from the air, as well as large-scale reforestation. The new research gave a much clearer picture of our likely climate future, said Frances Moore, at the University of California, and Zeke Hausfather, the climate research lead at Stripe, in a commentary in Nature. They said it showed the goal of ratcheting up the initial climate pledges made in 2015 in Paris had been “partially realised”. “But optimism should be curbed until promises to reduce emissions in the future are backed up with stronger short-term action,” they said. “It is easy to set ambitious climate targets for 30, 40 or even 50 years in the future, but it is much harder to enact the policies [needed] today.” Moore and Hausfather also warned of the danger of geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s war in Ukraine: “It would be a mistake to rule out a future characterised by resurgent nationalism that strains global cooperation and leads to increasing reliance on domestic fossil-fuel resources and a corresponding rise in emissions.” “Policymakers are standing at a crossroads,” said McGlade. “We can choose to lock in emissions and deepen the energy crisis. Or we can use this moment to take an honest step towards a cleaner, safer future.” McGlade said there were many policies that could make immediate or near-term impacts on the energy and climate crises, including reducing speed limits on roads, accelerating the rollout of renewable energy and electric vehicles, and stopping the venting of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from oil and gas production facilities and putting it into supply instead.",News/Environment,"‘Historic’: global climate plans can now keep heating below 2C, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/13/historic-global-climate-plans-can-now-keep-heating-below-2c-study-shows
4/14/2022,"Kyiv has tried to patch up diplomatic relations with Germany after snubbing a planned visit by the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, saying it would welcome a visit instead by the chancellor, Olaf Scholz. The snub to Steinmeier, who has a history as an advocate of close Russian-German economic ties, led to a backlash in Germany, with Scholz describing it on Wednesday as “irritating”. “The president would have liked to go to Ukraine,” Scholz told RBB public radio. “It would have been good to receive him. I don’t want to comment further. It is a little irritating, to be polite about it.” Separately, the ruling Social Democratic party (SPD) parliamentary group leader, Rolf Mützenich, said Ukraine should adhere to the minimum diplomatic standards. He called on all democratic parties in Germany to defend the president, a member of the SPD, from unjustified attacks. Michael Roth, an SDP foreign policy expert in the Bundestag, described the cancellation as a “great disappointment” adding it was important both sides remained in conversation. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, who has repeatedly clashed with German politicians – and Steinmeier in particular – said Scholz instead would be welcome. He had previously criticised the president’s visit saying Ukraine was not interested in symbolic visits that did not lead to the delivery of arms. Scholz was asked on Wednesday if he planned to visit Ukraine but replied by saying he was in more regular contact with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, than almost any other western politician. Germany has been seen as the constant backmarker in its support for Ukraine, blocking an EU-wide ban on Russian oil and refusing to provide heavy weaponry from its stocks on the basis that the weaponry was needed by the German army, or would be of little use to Ukraine defence forces untrained in the weaponry. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych told German public television on Wednesday it had not been Zelenskiy’s intention to offend Berlin. “I think the main argument was different – our president expects the chancellor so that he [Scholz] can take direct practical decisions, including weapons deliveries,” he told the broadcaster ZDF. The German president has a largely ceremonial role, while the chancellor heads the government. Arestovych said the fate of the strategic port city of Mariupol and the civilian population of eastern Ukraine “depends on the German weapons we could get”, but that had not been promised. Ukraine would like Germany to send Marder infantry fighting vehicles. Time is of the essence because “every minute that a tank doesn’t arrive … it is our children who are dying, being raped, being killed”, Arestovych said. The German political class “has seen the terrible images” of the war that he said recalled the destruction of Berlin in 1945. What the Russian army was doing in Ukraine “isn’t any different”. The former boxing world champion Wladimir Klitschko, the brother of Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko, told German media he hoped there would still be a visit by Steinmeier. “I hope that the visit of the German president to Kyiv will only be postponed and can be made up for in the coming weeks,” Klitschko told the Bild newspaper. Scholz, whose matter-of-fact style often leaves his critics exasperated, has been under pressure from within his own coalition government to go further. The Green party that runs the economics ministry and the Foreign Office has called for greater urgency, and been supportive of the transfer of heavy weaponry. There were also reports that Scholz’s office was even discouraging Green ministers from travelling to Kyiv. Robert Habeck, the economics minister, said “it is of no use if we say in nine months you will get something. The stuff has to go down there now”. The chair of the Bundestag defence committee, Marie Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, a member of the Free Democratic party (FDP) that is in a coalition with the SPD, visited western Ukraine with fellow committee members and advocated eastern European Nato countries hand over their old tanks and armoured vehicles to Ukraine, and in return receive replacements from western Nato countries. The chancellor initially responded to the Russian attack on Ukraine by promising a dramatic about-face in German defence and foreign policy, including a big increase in military spending. But his critics say he has failed to follow that up with the supply of arms that Ukraine says it needs. Germany has until now sent defensive arms, including anti-tank weapons, missile launchers and surface-to-air missiles in response to the conflict. It also says it has supplied more aid than any other EU country. The snub to Steinmeier, which has divided German opinion, has probably set back the chances of a visit by Scholz. Steinmeier was due to visit with the presidents of Poland and the three Baltic republics on Wednesday. Recently, Steinmeier has admitted to mistakes in Germany’s policy towards Russia, saying: “We stuck to bridges that Russia no longer believed in, and that our partners warned us about.” He had been one of the strongest advocates of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would have made Germany even more dependent on Russian gas. Kyiv regards these admissions of past error as only placing a greater onus on Germany to support Ukraine more urgently, and with greater practical measures. Scholz was given a boost when Germany’s top economic institutes predicted a full EU embargo on Russian energy would trigger a major recession in Germany, sending output down 2.2% next year and wiping out more than 400,000 jobs. The analysis underscored his position that an energy embargo would damage Germany as much as Russia. In practice, the immediate concern is whether Germany would accept a ban on Russian oil imports, the chief source of revenue for the Russian war machine. A full gas embargo is not currently under discussion in the EU.",News/World news,Ukraine seeks to patch up relations with Germany after snub to president,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/ukraine-seeks-to-patch-up-relations-with-germany-after-snub-to-president
4/14/2022,"Four journalists who worked for an independent Moscow student magazine have been sentenced to two years “corrective labour” over an online video in which they defended young Russians’ freedom of assembly. Former Doxa journalists Armen Aramyan, Natasha Tyshkevich, Alla Gutnikova and Volodya Metelkin had been under house arrest for almost a year after they were detained in April 2021 for posting a three-minute video on YouTube in which they said it was illegal to expel and intimidate students for participating in rallies in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. A Moscow court on Tuesday said the video had encouraged “the involvement of minors” in anti-Kremlin protests. Under Russian law, those handed correctional labour sentences must pay the government up to 20% of their wages if they are employed. If they are unemployed, they must work at jobs assigned by the country’s prison service during the term of their sentence. The Russian court also banned the four from administering internet resources for three years. Doxa founder Aramyan, 24, expressed relief that the sentence was not tougher: the four journalists had been facing up to three years in jail. “I am very glad to be finally free. It was an amazing feeling when our ankle bracelets were taken off right in court. It could have been worse,” he told the Guardian. “At the same time, we still received a real sentence for an absurd, made-up case,” Aramyan added. The sentencing comes amid an unprecedented crackdown on independent media and anti-war dissent. Last month, the Russian parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military. Human Rights Watch described the accusations against the four journalists as “baseless”. Dozens of leading scholars, including Slavoj Žižek, Etienne Balibar and Judith Butler signed an open letter in support of the journal in 2021. Doxa was set up by students and university graduates at the prestigious Moscow’s Higher School of Economics (HSE) in 2017. It quickly became the leading independent student outlet, exposing corruption and systemic sexual harassment in universities across the country. “We were really the first of our kind. A leftist, feminist, antiwar paper that was doing investigations. Students from across the country reached out to us,” Aramyan said. In 2019, the HSE cut its ties with Doxa after it voiced support for students who had taken part in the Moscow opposition protests that year. While the four editors said they had officially resigned from Doxa when their trial started, the outlet has continued its work, becoming one of the loudest antiwar voices in the country. A week after Russia launched the invasion of Ukraine, the authorities blocked Doxa’s website over its refusal to take down an explainer that was critical of the country’s role in Ukraine. Aramyan derided Russia’s actions in Ukraine during his closing statement in court earlier this month, taking a minute of silence “in memory of those who have died in this war,” despite repeated requests from the judge to continue his statement.",News/World news,Russian student journalists sentenced to labour over freedom of assembly video,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/russian-student-journalists-sentenced-to-labour-over-freedom-of-assembly-video
4/14/2022,"Further questions have been raised about military spending on impotence treatments under Jair Bolsonaro after allegations Brazil’s defense ministry had approved the purchase of penile implants costing more than half a million pounds. Those claims followed revelations on Monday that the armed forces had forked out for more than 35,000 Viagra pills in what one leading opposition politician called an erectile “outrage”. “[We] won’t allow Bolsonaro to turn Brazil into an orgy,” tweeted the leftist congresswoman Vivi Reis as the disclosures sparked an online outpouring of indignation and smirks. The military insists its acquisitions are above board. The navy and air force claimed they used Viagra to treat pulmonary hypertension. The army alleged it had bought only three silicone penile implants, rather than the 60 reported by the Brazilian media, and had spent far less than the 3.5m reais (£560,900) originally claimed. “The army healthcare system is assigned with treating male patients for various types of ailments that might require surgery for the implantation of such prostheses,” it said in a statement noting that it catered to about 700,000 patients. Bolsonaro defended the military on Wednesday telling reporters: “The armed forces buy Viagra to fight arterial hypertension as well as some rheumatic diseases”. “With all due respect, it’s nothing,” the president said of the quantity of the erectile dysfunction drug being purchased. Whatever the truth, the phallic furor has given Bolsonaro’s political foes an unmissable chance to skewer a rightwing populist who frequently boasts of being “imbrochável” (unfloppable). “Bolsonaro and his crew continue to laugh in the faces of Brazilians,” fumed Elias Vaz, an opposition congressman who wants an investigation into the impotence remedy scandal. Bolsonaro took office in 2019 promising to crack down on corruption and the leftist politicians, civil servants and artists he accused of sponging off the state. But critics said this week’s controversy exposed how the sponging continued unabated under Bolsonaro. About 150 million Brazilians will chose their next president in October when Latin America’s largest democracy goes to the polls. Bolsonaro is trailing his leftist rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in the polls. Lula, a two-term president from 2003 until 2011, has yet to comment on the penile row. But the 76-year-old has made a point of emphasizing his own vigor as he prepares for his sixth presidential campaign since 1989. “You can’t imagine how horny I feel to fix this country,” Lula said last year.",News/World news,Bolsonaro faces hard scrutiny over military’s purchase of penile implants,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/brazil-military-penile-implants-purchase-jair-bolsonaro
4/14/2022,"Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Tory leader, has renewed her calls for Boris Johnson to quit over the partygate scandal as she accused him of “traducing” the office of prime minister. One of the first Tories to call for his resignation when the scandal first broke, Davidson echoed a handful of Tory MPs who confirmed on Wednesday they stood by their no-confidence letters after Johnson’s fine for breaching his government’s Covid rules. Now a Tory peer, she said the prime minister had “made a mockery” of the British public’s sacrifices during the pandemic, opening up a split with Douglas Ross, her close ally and successor as Scottish Conservative leader. Ross was the first Tory MP to publicly urge Johnson to quit in January but has since withdrawn his no-confidence letter to the 1922 Committee, arguing it would boost Vladimir Putin if the British prime minister was forced out of office during the war in Ukraine. Speaking as the pair campaigned together in Edinburgh before May’s local council elections, Ross hinted his support for the prime minister was temporary and conditional, but refused to discuss what action he might take in future. He said his current support for Johnson was not a “free pass” but that questions about Johnson’s fate after the Ukraine war was over or if the Tories fared disastrously in May’s council elections, as many polls predict, were “hypothetical”. Ross said voters were justifiably “angry, furious, they’re livid” at the slew of fines issued to the prime minister, the chancellor and a host of Downing Street officials. “I share a lot of that anger and fury but I also have to look at the situation in Ukraine. I wish that wasn’t happening.” A series of Scottish opinion polls this year put the Tories third behind Labour for the first time in five years, threatening to end the Tories’ series of strong Scottish election results. Opposition parties believe the partygate scandal has significantly dented the Conservative’s popular support; Labour and the Liberal Democrat both claim they are picking up votes across Scotland. If true, that implies Davidson’s decision to publicly disagree with her close ally’s stance on the prime minister has tactical value for the Tories, by signalling to disillusioned voters the Conservatives remain unhappy and critical of Johnson’s conduct. Downplaying the polls, Ross said that Johnson resigning would “create a void, would create instability … Allies around the world would know he’s about to leave. And the most important person is all of this – Vladimir Putin – would know he’s about to leave and that instability would undermine everything the west is trying to do to help President Zelenskiy and the people of Ukraine.” Davidson said that if Johnson was sincere about wanting to uphold the law over Ukraine, he should start with his own conduct. “I don’t think the prime minister’s apology last night [over being fined] was anything other than contrite and a meaningful and I’m sure he is very sorry for what’s happened but I believe that the prime minister should lead by example,” she said. “I believe that the office of the prime minister is traduced when you’ve got somebody that breaks the laws that they himself have brought in and I completely understand that there are really big geopolitics happening. Right now. There are big international issues. But I still believe that when it comes to supporting a country fighting for freedom and democracy, you have to uphold your own rules. You have to.”",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson ‘made a mockery’ of UK’s Covid sacrifices, says Ruth Davidson",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/13/boris-johnson-covid-fine-uk-ruth-davidson
4/14/2022,"A campaign set up to make books accessible to all will hold its first literary festival this weekend, including a series of free events and a bookshop where people can “buy” free books. The Free Books Campaign was founded by cultural historian and researcher Sofia Akel as a fundraiser in July 2020. Her initial goal of £1,000, which would be used to buy books by authors of colour to donate to those who are unable to access them, surpassed expectations. Akel said: “Then it grew to £4,000, then £7,000, then £10,000, it just kept growing. And then publishers started reaching out saying they [had] got lots of brand new books that they could contribute. It was really organic. I’d just set out to do this fundraiser as a small action.” Books are given by the campaign, which has now been set up as a community interest company (CIC), to individuals, families, youth clubs, community centres, charities and schools. “It’s completely built on trust,” said Akel. “No one has to disclose anything personal to us. We have had people reach out to say it’s the first time they have ever owned a book – it can be really transformative. You are on a first journey with that book and that book with you.” The campaign collaborated in July 2021 with footballer Marcus Rashford through his book club and Macmillan Children’s Books, working to get 400 brand new books to young readers across the UK and Ireland. The inaugural Free Books Fest will be held at Copeland Gallery in Peckham, London, on 16 and 17 April, in partnership with podcast company Broccoli Productions. The festival will include a free bookshop and lounge, where those attending can pick up books and spend time reading. “We wanted to make sure our festival caters to people from different backgrounds,” said Akel. “They can all access it equally. No one in that space will have to worry ‘can I afford to take part in any part of this event?’” She added: “With the bookstore, it’s empowering to be able to go and have a browse and choose a book that you want yourself rather than be told ‘here’s this book that you should read’ and this is the only one you can have.” Highlights of the event include a reading and drawing workshop for children with award-winning illustrator Dapo Adeola, a talk from historian and author Colin Grant, and a panel on romance and love with Candice Carty-Williams, Jendella Benson and Bolu Babalola, hosted by Danielle Vitalis. “The traditional format of literary festivals can be quite exclusionary and you can feel like ‘these spaces aren’t for me’,” said Akel. “So what we really had in mind was thinking about those who might be brand new to reading. Free Books Fest will not be the only festival offering a free programme this year. The Edinburgh international book festival has also announced that its 2022 schools programme – back after a two-year hiatus because of the pandemic – will be free, with every child who attends given a book, through its partnership with its lead sponsor Baillie Gifford.",Arts/Books,Free Books Fest aims to give excluded readers their first ‘journey with a book’,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/13/free-books-fest-aims-to-give-excluded-readers-their-first-journey-with-a-book
4/14/2022,"A California appeals court has upheld a lower court ruling that Johnson & Johnson must pay penalties to the state for deceptively marketing pelvic mesh implants for women. Johnson & Johnson had appealed in 2020 after superior court judge Eddie Sturgeon assessed the $344m in penalties against the US pharmaceutical company’s subsidiary, Ethicon. Sturgeon found after a non-jury trial that the company made misleading and potentially harmful statements in hundreds of thousands of advertisements and instructional brochures over nearly two decades. California’s fourth district court of appeals issued a ruling Monday that $42m in penalties assessed for the company’s sales pitches to doctors were unjustified because there was no evidence of what the sales representatives actually said. As a result, the court reduced the amount to $302m. However, the appeals court said Sturgeon received ample evidence that Ethicon knowingly deceived both physicians and patients about the risks posed by its products, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Ryan Carbain, a Johnson & Johnson spokesperson, told the Chronicle that the company would appeal the appeals court ruling to the state supreme court. “Ethicon responsibly communicated the risks and benefits of its trans-vaginal mesh products to doctors and patients and in full compliance with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) laws,” he said. The instructions for use in all the company’s pelvic mesh implant packages “falsified or omitted the full range, severity, duration, and cause of complications associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products, as well as the potential irreversibility and catastrophic consequences,” presiding justice Judith McConnell, of the appeals court, said in a 3-0 ruling upholding the $302m in penalties. The court also said that the fines are not excessive, as “the court found that … Johnson & Johnson had a net worth of more than $70.4bn,” according to court documents. “The civil penalty imposed by the trial court ($343,993,750) and the amended civil penalty award ($302,037,500) each constitute less than one half of one percent of Johnson & Johnson’s net worth. Given these figures, it is apparent that Ethicon has ample ability to pay the civil penalty award,” it continued. Many women have sued the New Jersey-based company alleging that the mesh caused severe pain, bleeding, infections, discomfort during intercourse and the need for removal surgically. The condition is estimated to affect 3% to 17% of women and it sometimes becomes severe after age 70. Pelvic mesh is surgically inserted to treat conditions including stress-related urinary incontinence, bladder leakage and organ prolapse, which can cause pain and pressure during urinary movements and during sexual intercourse.",News/US news,Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $302m over pelvic mesh implant ads,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/13/johnson-johnson-pelvic-mesh-implant-ads-case
4/14/2022,"“It’s so hard to focus, because I know that you’re watching,” complains Charli XCX to camera in this video diary about her lockdown project: cobbling together fourth album How I’m Feeling Now in an ad hoc home studio in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, that’s the predicament the pop star has made for herself, thanks to her hyper-intimate relationship with her fanbase; not just sharing her millennial insecurities freely with them on social media, but also the making of this record. How I’m Feeling Now – recorded to a tight deadline – joins Bo Burnham’s Inside and Zoom slasher Host as quarantine-prompted creative endeavours to put our burnt banana bread and wonky tomato trellises to shame. Charli XCX, saying art is crucial for her mental wellbeing, rolls her sleeves up as soon she receives a box of mics from her producer. She massages her off-kilter lockdown emotions into zeitgeist-ready toplines over choice beats arriving in her inbox from around the world. Long-term boyfriend Huck Kwong, with whom she finds herself in sudden cohabitation after previously never having spent more than 11 days with him, is another source of inspiration. What is interesting is the strongly collaborative aspect to the work, with the singer-songwriter in more or less constant communication with her fans, running tracks by them and, in one instance, crowdsourcing lyrics. Others have tried this beta-test approach, including Kanye West from Life of Pablo onwards, but there is something especially familial about Charli XCX’s take on it. Alone Together intersperses its focus on her music-making with segments from the bedrooms of eight LGBT “Angels” (ie XCX fans), all of whom have found a sense of belonging in her community. It feels like a very modern, fusional kind of digital fandom – not dissimilar to the intense feedback loop between followers and luminaries on show in this year’s anime hit Belle. Alone Together has similar virtual-style sequences, with the fans featured pictured as stylised avatars, though they somewhat undermine the film’s claim to being a spontaneous documentation of lo-fi creativity. But Charli XCX’s drive and heart are infectious, even for non-Angels.  Charli XCX: Alone Together is released in cinemas on 14 April and on digital platforms on 18 April.",Arts/Film,Charli XCX: Alone Together review – singer’s intimate journal,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/13/charli-xcx-alone-together-review-singers-intimate-journal
4/14/2022,"Aplay about a self-help circle can usually guarantee some laughs at the expense of positive-thinking homilies and cliches. Katie Redford’s funny-sad drama comes in the form of a motivational group, each scene a new meeting. It is the brainchild of Co-op worker, Gavi (Max Hastings), convening Go Get It! from his Nottingham garage for colleagues who share his dream of self-improvement. Directed by Piers Black, there are some gentle laughs as Gavi delivers his fridge-magnet wisdom on seizing the day and reaching for new goals. But the turnout of two – a mother and daughter – sets up a spiky dynamic which becomes the basis for a play with serious underlying issues around mental illness in families and complicated love between mothers and children. Gavi himself is caring for his seriously ill mum, though we get rather too limited information about that relationship. Instead, the focus is on Dawn (Jennifer Daley), a mother with a history of depression, and Jen (Olivia Sweeney), her stroppy twentysomething daughter who is having an unhealthy on-off relationship with a married man. Redford’s play has a watchable, episodic-TV quality, with some amusing dialogue and interesting narrative turns. But on its opening night, the early part of the production had halting and underpowered performances until the play was temporarily stopped altogether due to a sick audience member requiring an ambulance. It was later resumed, and – heroically – the actors came back with more energy. Hastings starts out in a swirl of positivity, writing out tasks and goals with chalk across the walls. It does not take long for us to figure out that this attitude is confected and that he is harbouring unspoken pain. His emotionally withheld performance is reminiscent of Paul Mescal’s in the TV adaptation of Normal People in its minimalism and sustained pauses, but these are perhaps better suited to screen closeups. Sweeney and Daley have bare-faced antagonism in their mother-daughter relationship, but the atmosphere does not feel charged enough, although Sweeney as the begrudging daughter stands out for her strong performance. The subject of mental health and its distorting effects on family relationships is an important one, but the central confrontation is not nearly as moving as its equivalent in Sian Carter’s recent debut, Running With Lions, also about mental illness within families. Here, it feels too neatly resolved, and not passionate or emotionally penetrating enough. The most moving moments are between Gavi and Jen, in their undertow of attraction, not mother and daughter. But there is some good writing by Redford, and despite the sense that some performances could be further developed, these characters tug at our heartstrings. By the end, the play reveals itself to have a sweet, romantic centre. At Theatre503, London, until 23 April.",Arts/Stage,Tapped review – inside the funny-sad world of the Go Get It! group,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/13/trapped-theatre503
4/14/2022,"Indonesia has passed a landmark bill that for the first time outlaws forced marriage and sexual harassment. To tears and cheers from supporters in the gallery, on Tuesday the House of Representatives passed the long-awaited legislation that criminalises nine forms of sexual violence, including physical and verbal assault, harassment, forced sterilisation and exploitation. The new law includes 15-year prison sentences for sexual exploitation, nine years for forced marriage and four years for circulating non-consensual sexual content. It also stipulates that a court must compel convicted abusers to pay compensation to victims, who must also be offered counselling. The law was proposed by the National Commission on Violence Against Women (Komnas Perempuan) and civil society groups 10 years ago. It was first deliberated by the House of Representatives in 2016. The legislation had been opposed by conservative groups, who argued the bill’s definition of sexual violence supported liberal values that allowed “deviant” sexual behaviours. The new legislation comes amid rising cases of violence against women in Indonesia. Komnas Perempuan reported 338,496 cases in 2021 – up from 220,000 in 2020. “When I heard the knock [of the gavel], my mask was just filled with tears. I was trembling so much. I think my voice was the loudest in the room. I kept screaming thank you and thank you,” said Imbaniasih Achmad, 56, who was in the house to see the bill pass. Iim has been campaigning for the legislation since her daughter was raped in 2015. “Yesterday morning before I left home, I said to my daughter, Ibu [mother] will go to the house today. Today they will finally pass the bill,” she said. “She understands that this fight is not just for her, but for all the women, for all of us.” Willy Aditya, deputy chair of the team that spearheaded the bill, said the deliberations had been “intensive”. “The participation of civil society has been enormous, even until the last moments, until the last seconds, we are still receiving inputs from them,” Willy said. The director of the Jakarta chapter of the Legal Aid Foundation of the Indonesian Women’s Association for Justice, Siti Mazumah, said the bill signalled a new beginning for the country. “This is not just about law; this is the beginning of a new civilisation that we create together. Indonesia has become a nation that will not tolerate and normalise sexual violence,” she said on Wednesday. Siti said survivors of sexual violence are often blamed by their community, and face discrimination from the authorities when they report cases. The foundation said only about 30% of attacks are reported because victims are often scared or discouraged from going to the police. “Now we have to make sure that the government will provide the instruments and facilities for this law so it can be implemented. The capacity building of every related institution; making sure they understand how to work with each institution, understand the victims’ perspective, the victims’ rights,” she said.
