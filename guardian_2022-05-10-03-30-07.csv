5/10/2022,"The departure of Sri Lanka’s prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, follows weeks of protest and a deepening crisis. There is no bankruptcy system for states but if there was then the south Asian country – down to its last $50m (£40m) of reserves – would be first in line to use it. A team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week started work with officials in Colombo over a bailout that will include a tough package of reforms as well as financial support. But as the IMF and its sister organisation, the World Bank, know full well, this is about more than the mismanagement of an individual country. They fear Sri Lanka is the canary in the coalmine. Across the world, low- and middle-income countries are struggling with a three-pronged crisis: the pandemic, the rising cost of their debt, and the increase in food and fuel prices caused by Russia’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. David Malpass, the World Bank’s president, explained his concerns at the organisation’s spring meeting last month. “I’m deeply concerned about developing countries,” Malpass said. “They are facing sudden price increases for energy, fertiliser and food, and the likelihood of interest rate increases. Each one hits them hard.” The UN has sought to quantify the problem. Its trade and development arm – UNCTAD – said in a recent report that there were 107 countries facing one of three shocks: rising food prices, rising energy prices or tighter financial conditions. Of those, 69 were facing all three: 25 in Africa, 25 in Asia and the Pacific, and 19 in Latin America and the Pacific. The list of countries that look vulnerable is long and varied: the IMF has opened rescue talks with Egypt and Tunisia – both big wheat importers from Russia and Ukraine – and with Pakistan, which has imposed power cuts because of the high cost of imported energy. Sub-Saharan African countries being carefully watched include Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Ethiopia. Argentina recently signed a $45bn debt deal with the IMF, but other Latin American countries at risk include El Salvador and Peru. For months there has been speculation that Turkey would be the first domino to fall, but despite an annual inflation rate of 70% and an unconventional approach to economic management, it is still standing. Unlike some other countries under threat, Turkey is able to feed its own people. Richard Kozul-Wright, director of the globalisation and development strategies division at UNCTAD, said: “Countries have domestic problems but most of the shocks have nothing to do with those. The pandemic and the war had nothing to do with these countries, but have led to a huge increase in borrowing.” The World Bank said almost 60% of the lowest-income countries were in debt distress or at high risk of it before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while the cost of servicing borrowing is rising steeply, particularly for those countries that have amassed debts in foreign currencies. War in Ukraine has led to investors seeking out the safe haven of the US dollar, pushing down the value of emerging market currencies. Higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, America’s central bank, have compounded the problem. Emerging market crises are nothing new, but Kozul-Wright said the international community was ill-prepared to deal with a looming debt problem. “The system can only deal with these problems country by country,” he said. “But these are systemic issues and currently there is no way of dealing with them systemically.” That may prove costly. Sri Lanka is the first country to buckle under the mounting economic pressures triggered by the war in Ukraine. It is unlikely to be the last.",News/World news,Sri Lanka is the first domino to fall in the face of a global debt crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/sri-lanka-is-the-first-domino-to-fall-in-the-face-of-a-global-debt-crisis
5/10/2022,"All’s well that ends well? Not quite. McColl’s has obviously got the right rescuer in the shape of Morrisons, the biggest supplier by far to the 1,100-strong convenience store chain. But David Potts, the chief executive of Morrisons, was entitled to say he was “disappointed” that this mini-drama involved McColl’s going into administration at all. He could have said “furious”. His group’s proposal at the end of last week to take the business in solvent form appeared to tick the main boxes. It protected pensioners, sought to maximise employment among McColl’s 16,000 staff and allowed bank lenders to switch into Morrisons-backed debt with a superior covenant. Most of all, the plan had commercial sense in its favour: with 250 McColl’s stores trading under the Morrisons Daily banner, so the major supermarket had a strong incentive to make the mismanaged operator work. It has looked the natural owner of McColl’s for weeks, if not months. So why were administrators summoned by the banks last Friday? The answer to that question seems only to be the fact that the rival proposal from EG Group, the petrol forecourt business owned by the Issa brothers of Asda fame, would have seen lenders get paid in full upfront. Put another way, the banks – understood to include Barclays, HSBC and NatWest – prioritised certainty for themselves even though the EG proposal, at that stage, created uncertainties for McColl’s pensioners who were exposed to the risk of a cut in their benefits. As it happens, Morrisons succeeded over the weekend by matching EG’s offer to the banks (and EG, incidentally, improved its pitch to pensioners by saying it would have accepted full responsibility for the two pension funds). But the sour taste left by this saga is that the banks put the business into administration, thereby creating extra risks. There was no need to do so. These situations are often messy and rushed, but this one did not have to be. No harm was ultimately done this time, but Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, should take note. A recession looms and UK plc will need its lenders to see the wider picture in many more rescue jobs. The most irritating line in politics at the moment is the Treasury’s refrain that the chancellor will take a view on further support for hard-pressed energy consumers only after Ofgem announces in August the next change in its price cap, which will apply from the start of October. It is irritating, first, because it seems to imagine that miraculous news on energy prices could turn up between now and August. The reality is that, even if wholesale markets provide mild relief from here, bills are going up in the autumn. The six-month “observation window” for setting the next price cap has already passed the halfway point and current projections suggest a figure close to £2,900 for an average household, versus £1,971 today. And it is irritating, second, for a reason highlighted by comments from Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, on Monday. “You need to be in a position to name a solution in July if there’s going to be time to devise a method of implementing it in time for October,” he said. Well, quite. If support is to be administered through bills, which would be the most direct method, systems have to be reset and qualifying criteria have to be agreed. The process can be fiddly. A last-minute scramble risks a package that is full of holes. Anderson’s preferred solution is well known: a £1,000 reduction off bills for low-income households, who could be defined in a number of ways – via universal credit or the warm homes discounts scheme, or more of a challenge, via a definition of fuel poverty. The proposal has its pluses and minuses but it does, at least, recognise the scale of what’s needed: last winter the price cap was £1,277, so an increase to £2,900-ish would take energy bills into unaffordable territory for millions of households. Rishi Sunak’s modest February package is not big enough to cope. It is possible that Treasury cogs are whirring behind in the background, but nothing we have heard from Sunak suggests so. Yes, the precise level of the price cap matters, but there is still a big planning and modelling job to be done. The Treasury could do everybody a favour by dropping its “wait and see” chant and recognising the urgency of developing a plan for a crisis that could yet become worse.",News/Business,McColl’s saga is lesson banks must take onboard with recession looming | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/may/09/mccolls-saga-banks-recession-rescue-administrators
5/10/2022,"When Vladimir Putin launched what was intended as a blitzkrieg attack on Kyiv in February, he would have assumed that annual May celebrations of the Soviet victory over nazism would merge with a more contemporary triumph. Things have not worked out that way. The protracted troubles of the Russian army meant that Monday’s Victory Day parade of military might was smaller than usual. The usual flypast, which in honour of the current war was to feature a Z formation of MiG-29 fighters, was unexpectedly cancelled. In some Russian cities, traditional symbols had been adapted to place the years 1945 and 2022 side by side. But there has been no victory in Ukraine – from where President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave his own Victory Day speech, rejecting the cultural appropriation of the Soviet resistance by Moscow. The abject failure of the Kremlin’s strategy, and the humiliation inflicted on Russian forces, led to speculation that Mr Putin would use his traditional address to escalate matters still further. Thankfully, this did not happen. There were no new warnings to the west regarding Moscow’s nuclear capabilities. Nor did the speech contain a formal declaration of war, which would have allowed the mobilisation of badly needed reserve forces. Instead, Mr Putin used the occasion to shore up the home front, which has so far been kept relatively quiescent through a combination of repression and propaganda. A by-now familiar litany of baseless assertions and distortions was deployed to justify the stalled, illegal and brutal invasion. Once again, the Russian president claimed that Kyiv was seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. A preposterous continuity was asserted between the Soviet Union’s resistance to Hitler and Mr Putin’s own confrontation with Ukraine, the west and Nato. American-backed forces with historic links to the Nazis, he claimed, were planning to terrorise the Donbas and invade Crimea. Russian soldiers were defending historical territory that belonged to the motherland, “fighting for the same thing their fathers and grandfathers did”. All dismally predictable and re-hashed. But perhaps more tellingly, Mr Putin’s speech also made a rare reference to Russian casualties sustained in the conflict that he unilaterally provoked. Since March, no information has been released by Moscow on the number of troops killed, wounded or captured in Ukraine – but the figure is likely to run into the tens of thousands. Acknowledging “irreparable loss for relatives and friends”, Mr Putin announced that support would be put in place for the children of the dead and for the wounded. Placed alongside the failure to mobilise reservists, this gesture may signal a nascent preoccupation with public morale during a war that was meant to be over. Russia’s military campaign has been profoundly unimpressive. A month after abandoning the idea of occupying Kyiv and focusing on the east, real progress remains elusive. As the conflict drags on, the effect of sanctions is expected to shrink the Russian economy by up to 12% by the end of the year, and the European Union is working towards agreement on an oil embargo. Back home, so far, practised authoritarian methods and relentless propaganda on state media have been doing their job. Internal dissent has been ruthlessly suppressed and criminalised, and an initial burst of anti-war demonstrations was quickly quelled with more than 15,000 protesters detained. According to a survey conducted by the Novaya Gazeta newspaper – which has suspended publication in Russia in protest at censorship – Mr Putin enjoys patriotic approval ratings of over 80%. But the same poll finds deep anxiety and apprehension regarding his war. This unease is not yet a problem for the Putin regime. But as economic hardship gradually deepens and an attritional conflict drags on with no end in sight, it may yet become one.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Putin’s Victory Day speech: justifying the unjustifiable | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/09/the-guardian-view-on-putins-victory-day-speech-justifying-the-unjustifiable
5/10/2022,"Sir Keir Starmer has done the right thing and offered to resign if he is fined over breaking lockdown rules. His decision is in stark contrast to Boris Johnson. Whereas Sir Keir is prepared to fall on his sword, Mr Johnson has let others take the blame. Mr Johnson did apologise after being given a penalty notice by the Metropolitan police for Covid breaches. He is the first prime minister to be punished for breaking the law when the ministerial code expects him to follow it. But he refused to resign. It would be a cruel twist of fate if Sir Keir was the only one of the pair to go. Mr Johnson has not only been fined, he faces being fined for a number of other occasions. More than 50 people have paid penalties over Downing Street parties during lockdown. Mr Johnson is in the grip of a SW1 pincer movement: squeezed on one side by civil servant Sue Gray’s imminent report into Downing Street’s partying culture and on another flank by a House of Commons privileges committee inquiry into whether or not the prime minister lied to MPs. Damning verdicts resulting from either should be enough to finish off Mr Johnson. The Labour leader believes – reasonably – in his innocence. Durham constabulary had looked at the case and cleared him earlier. But like arsenic in the water supply of the nation’s political culture, accusations about Sir Keir’s election campaign have sloshed around the media. He feared being seen by voters as endorsing the idea that there was one rule for politicians and another for the public. New revelations last weekend renewed pressure on the Labour leader. His defence has not changed: that the curry and beer consumed by him, Angela Rayner and activists in April last year occurred during a work break and not at a social event. Sir Keir says this means the rules were not broken. However, the Labour leader knows that voters are sceptical of such explanations. Instead, they may come to wish a plague on both parties’ houses. Sir Keir did not want voters to think he was like Mr Johnson, a politician without an ethical compass. This is to his credit. But he is betting more than his own job. His deputy – Ms Rayner – will also have to resign if Durham police issues fines. This places considerable pressure on officers, who have in their hands the careers of the Labour leadership. The force came under fire for finding that Dominic Cummings’ journey to Barnard Castle during lockdown probably amounted to a “minor” breach of the rules, but stopped short of fining Mr Johnson’s then top adviser. Sir Keir refused to commit to resigning if Durham police chose to admonish rather than fine him. That may be a distinction lost on the public. The stakes could not be higher. The Labour leader has bet that the police will not fine him and that he can show himself to be a politician who has principles and sticks to them – unlike Mr Johnson. Sir Keir’s political career has been defined by caution. It would be brutal if it was ended by one big gamble.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Starmer’s pledge: I’m not unethical like Boris Johnson | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/09/the-guardian-view-on-starmers-pledge-im-not-unethical-like-boris-johnson
5/10/2022,"Ann-Katrin Berger: The German failed to match her spectacular 2020-21 campaign but still had a solid season. Kept nine clean sheets, finishing third behind Arsenal’s Manuela Zinsberger and Manchester United’s Mary Earps in the race for the golden glove. 7 Zecira Musovic: The Sweden international coped well when handed the gloves in some cup games and when Berger was sent off against Tottenham at the Hive. A very capable back-up who would be first choice at many clubs. 6 Maren Mjelde: Emma Hayes said Chelsea had prepared for Mjelde to be a key part of the season after she missed the second half of the 2020-21 campaign with an ACL injury. But the full-back was a bit-part player with injuries again keeping her out for stretches of the season. 6 Aniek Nouwen: The Netherlands centre-back performed well when deployed in an experimental back three, but struggled for starts in her first season with the Blues. Hayes is phasing her into the squad and the signs are promising. 5 Millie Bright: Bright has been consistently outstanding for Chelsea in recent years. With centre-back partner Magda Eriksson sidelined at various times, Bright has stepped up, adapted to whoever is playing alongside her, and commanded the back line. She has done the same for England. 9 Magda Eriksson: The captain’s season was pockmarked by injury layoffs, but each time she stepped on to the pitch, Chelsea instantly looked stronger. Who knows how much better Chelsea would have been across all competitions had the Swede been more available. 7 Jess Carter: A phenomenal campaign for the England international which has surely cemented her place in Sarina Wiegman’s England Euros squad. Carter performed well as part of a back three, a back four and when pushed further forward. 8 Jonna Andersson: Andersson looked more comfortable in a back four than when deployed in a back three, which limited her starts. However, in her final season at Chelsea, she proved her value and experience with two important assists in two games in the run-in. 7 Sophie Ingle: With Melanie Leupolz pregnant, Ingle played more than she would have been expected to. The Wales international shielded the defence efficiently and slotted into the back line when required. 7 Ji So-yun: In her final league game for Chelsea, Ji came off the bench to provide a momentum shift and, at that point, the thought occurred that Hayes may try to persuade the South Korean to stay. Arguably the best foreign import the WSL has seen. 7 Drew Spence: Chelsea’s longest-serving player was a reliable option off the bench when the team needed to see out a game. A solid defensive substitute and, arguably, deserving of a more regular starting berth. 6 Niamh Charles: Has bags of potential and showed she is extremely versatile, playing on both flanks in midfield and defence. Did a decent job when called in to cover for those out injured and is one to follow next season. 6 Erin Cuthbert: The workhorse of the team did the dirty work whenever called upon, playing all across the pitch, man-marking players and doing it with a desire and drive that made her successful at every task she was faced with. Invaluable. 8 Guro Reiten: By her own admission, Reiten struggled during the pandemic-hit season. This season, however, she shone, providing creativity and flair from the wings. With others dipping in and out of the side with injuries, the Norwegian was remarkably consistent. 8 Jessie Fleming: The 24-year-old chipped in with six league goals in a season where her game time increased and she slotted in seamlessly. She is not like-for-like cover for the departing Ji but she will undeniably play an important role following the South Korean’s exit. The future of Chelsea’s midfield. 7 Fran Kirby: Last year’s player of the season struggled with a fatigue issue that Chelsea are only now finding answers to. Her blistering start to the campaign was cruelly cut short by the problem, which has also kept her out of England contention. Despite that, Kirby provided six league assists, the most of any Chelsea player. 7 Beth England: It was a tumultuous campaign for the England forward, who often had to sit out as Kerr, Harder and others were preferred in attack. Nevertheless, the striker was Chelsea’s second-highest scorer with eight league goals and proved to be a deadly substitute. 7 Sam Kerr: The Australian secured her second consecutive golden boot with 20 goals, just one shy of the 21 she scored last year despite spending a month away at the Asia Cup in January. She has been extraordinarily consistent and scored whenever the Blues needed a breakthrough to stay in the title race. 9 Pernille Harder: With Kirby out and Kerr away at the Asia Cup, Harder shouldered the load up front. The Denmark forward looked more settled in the Chelsea squad in her second season and was the creative fulcrum. 9 It would be unfair to rate Melanie Leupolz given her season ended with the announcement of her pregnancy. Leupolz made seven league appearances and was an important part of the midfield. Lauren James has struggled for minutes since returning to Chelsea but is likely play a more notable role next season. Russian defender Alsu Abdullina did not appear often enough to be rated. It was a tough season for the 21-year-old, who has struggled with the language barrier and had to cope with the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in her first year in England.",Sport/Football,Chelsea’s WSL champions: player-by-player ratings for Emma Hayes’s squad,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/chelseas-wsl-champions-player-by-player-ratings-for-emma-hayess-squad
5/10/2022,"Erling Haaland is poised to become a Manchester City player this week after passing a medical and the Premier League champions telling Borussia Dortmund they will activate the 21-year-old’s €75m (£64m) release clause. The deal is expected to be announced imminently by the German club, Haaland having informed them of his wish to leave after two-and-a-half years in Germany. Personal terms between the player and City have been agreed. Haaland will earn a basic salary of around £350,000 a week with considerable bonuses and is poised to sign a five-year contract. For the Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, the deal ends his search for a long-term successor to the club-record goalscorer, Sergio Agüero. Guardiola began his quest to replace the Argentinian last summer when he departed for Barcelona. At the time the No 1 target was Tottenham’s Harry Kane but City were priced out of any prospective deal by Daniel Levy, the north London club’s chairman, who valued Kane at £150m. Guardiola’s desire to also acquire Jack Grealish, who cost a British-record £100m when he joined from Aston Villa last summer, made the transfer of Kane impossible. This season Guardiola turned his focus to Haaland. The City manager admires the Norwegian, who has scored 85 goals in 88 appearances for Dortmund, but wanted to make sure he had the ability to suit City’s fluid passing style. When Real Madrid, who had been Haaland’s first-choice destination, decided to make Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappé their prime summer target, it cleared the way for City to firm up their interest in Haaland after Guardiola gave the move the green light. This season City have played the majority of their matches with a “false No 9”. This has usually been of one of Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden or Bernardo Silva with Gabriel Jesus also operating in the position occasionally. City have scored 89 Premier League goals this season, the highest in the division, with three games remaining yet in crucial matches they have missed numerous chances, the first Champions League semi-final first leg against Real Madrid being a prime example. City won 4-3 on the night but lost the return 3-1 to be knocked out 6-5 on aggregate. Haaland is a proven scorer, scoring 134 goals in 182 career appearances with 36 assists. There has been a concern that his huge physical frame – Haaland is 6ft 4in – could cause injuries and he missed 26 games for Dortmund between November 2020 and January 2022. However, he already has 181 senior games at the age of 21 and City are confident he will be a success. One player who is unlikely to join City is Paul Pogba. The Frenchman shares the same agency as Haaland and City have explored the possibility of signing the Manchester United midfielder. The 29-year-old is available on a free transfer if he leaves United in the close season as is expected. Pogba is believed to be flattered by City’s interest but Guardiola and the City sporting director, Txiki Begiristain, believe his preference is to sign for another club. Real Madrid and PSG are among those that retain an interest in Pogba. Guardiola’s interest in Pogba caused surprise in some quarters as he has often underwhelmed in his six years at United. Yet as Fernandinho will leave City when the his contract expires at the end of June, the manager is intent on reinforcing his midfield.",Sport/Football,Erling Haaland set to join Manchester City after passing medical,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/erling-haaland-set-to-join-manchester-city-after-passing-medical
5/10/2022,"Huge swarms of locusts are wreaking havoc on the Italian island of Sardinia, arriving a month earlier than in previous years. The worst-affected area is the province of Nuoro, where the winged insects have decimated crops across 25,000 hectares (62,000 acres) of land, following swarms in 2019 said to be the worst in decades and further infestations in 2020 and 2021. Leonardo Salis, the president of the Nuoro unit of Coldiretti, the Italian farmers’ association, said their passage destroyed the crops of an entire field, sending months of farmers’ work and investments “up in smoke”. The locusts are also wrecking vegetable gardens. Salis said that after three years of complaints and proposals to authorities to tackle the insects, “we are shocked that we still find ourselves talking about the invasion of locusts”. He added: “Farmers are now disillusioned and this year some changed their crop plan in order to try and limit the damage because they knew nothing would change. Among other things, they have not yet received a euro to compensate for the damage suffered.” Gabriella Murgia, the island’s councillor for agriculture, said on Monday that an anti-locust taskforce was working unabated. “There is no time to lose,” she told the local press, adding that the team, together with forestry workers, was identifying the worst-affected areas and accelerating pest control operations. “The maximum collaboration of farmers and all other interested parties is required,” she said. The infestation comes days after regional authorities approved €2m (£1.7m) in compensation to farmers whose crops were damaged by the insects in 2021. Christian Solinas, the president of Sardinia, told L’Unione Sarda newspaper: “The invasion of locusts devastated the Nuoro countryside, bringing several companies to their knees. Compensation is essential to allow farmers to cope with a sharp decline in their income, guaranteeing concrete support in the face of an emergency that has added to their difficulties of recent years.”",News/World news,Locust swarms destroy crops in Sardinia’s latest infestation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/locust-swarms-destroy-crops-sardinia-latest-infestation
5/10/2022,"A former World of Warcraft fanatic who was “good but not great” at running at school has broken the record for scaling all 214 Wainwright fells in the Lake District. Many walkers set themselves a lifetime challenge of summiting every peak in Alfred Wainwright’s seven-volume Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. John Kelly, a 37-year-old data scientist from Tennessee in the US, completed them all in five days, 12 hours and 14 minutes. He slept between one and 2.5 hours a night, taking micro-naps in a camper van at 25 meeting points along the way. “I’m told I napped between bites of pizza at one point,” he told the Guardian. He attempted to eat 300 calories every hour, but said it was impossible to replace the energy he burned each day. The father of four smashed the record set last year by Sabrina Verjee – who supported him in this attempt – by about 11 hours. He was also assisted by Nicky Spinks, a breast cancer survivor who has broken numerous fell running records; evidence, he says “of just how supportive and strong the ultrarunning community is”. The 320-mile (515km) challenge, which includes England’s highest mountain, Scafell Pike, involves a total ascent of 36,000m (118,000ft). Kelly had to abort his first attempt at the challenge last July after suffering with heat and foot problems. His children – five-year-old twins, an 8-year-old and a 19-month-old – joined him for the last leg of the run on Saturday. “It was kind of funny because I had to ask my eight-year-old to slow down because he ran off so fast,” said Kelly. He insisted he was never a brilliant athlete growing up. “I ran cross-country and did athletics at school, but I wasn’t the top person on the team. I was good, but not great; I could do 5km in around 17 minutes.” His training for ultrarunning mostly takes place on his daily commute, running 10km to and from his office in Bristol, where he is the tech co-founder at Envelop Risk Analytics. On his website, where he calls himself the Random Forest Runner, Kelly describes his previous passions, saying he “used to be a pretty serious water-skier. And World of Warcraft player. But now just family, work, and running.” Asked by the Guardian why he runs, Kelly said: “Facing these types of challenges that put us at our absolute limits really strips us down to who we are: what our strengths are, what our weaknesses are. We learn how to leverage those, how to mitigate them. And I get to do this while doing an activity I love, which is being out in the mountains and exploring as many of them as possible in the time I have.” Kelly is a winner of the Barkley Marathons, often described as the world’s toughest endurance race, which sees competitors try to run 100 miles within 60 hours in the Tennessee wilderness. He also holds the record for completing all 258 miles of the Pennine Way, finishing in 58 hours and 4 minutes last May. In addition, he has completed the Grand Round (the Paddy Buckley Round in Wales, the Bob Graham Round in the Lake District, and the Ramsay Round in the Highlands) continuously, linking them by bike. He and his family are returning to the US at the end of the month, and his next challenge is the 100-mile Hardrock race in Colorado.",Lifestyle/Life and style,John Kelly breaks record for scaling all 214 Wainwright fells in the Lake District,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/09/john-kelly-breaks-record-for-scaling-all-214-wainwright-fells-in-the-lake-district
5/10/2022,"Over the last two years, most of us have experienced the sting of a party cancellation – from weddings and galas to school formals. There was a period when crowded dancefloors and uncomfortably high heels felt like a thing of the past. Happily, it’s 2022, and we are – hopefully – post-lockdowns and limits on gatherings. To celebrate, well, the return of celebrations, here is some expert advice on the special care everything from tulle, to beading, to lace requires. Almost everyone I know still has some pent-up lockdown energy to expend and while a dancefloor is undeniably a good place to do this, try to keep half an eye on the wellbeing of your outfit. According to Howard Duffy, a technical officer at the Drycleaning Institute of Australia, “sensibility is key”. He says “spilt drinks on a venue’s floor can lead to a stained or black hem,” which can be particularly difficult to remove, “especially on more fragile fabrics”. The dancefloor can also be a hazardous place for drink spills that land on shirts or tops. If this happens, he says to dry spot clean the stain to contain it, without wetting or rubbing the fabric. He warns that using water to spot clean an oil stain on a delicate fabric can set the stain and leave a spotting mark – so grab a napkin or paper towel, and gently blot at the stain instead. A good specialist dry cleaner will do a thorough inspection of any garment when it is dropped off, and ask you to explain what each stain is from. This is because liquids react differently on different fabrics – for instance, the detergent required to remove oil on silk will be different from the one that gets rid of wine on cotton. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Ellina Sun, a logistics supervisor at fashion rental company Glam Corner, says to “make it easier for the dry cleaner to remove [the stain] using the correct method”, you should be very detailed about what type of stain they are dealing with. It’s wise to also mention any previous washing and cleaning methods the garment has gone through, so the dry cleaner understands the wear of the fabric, and if it is possible to remove the stain. When looking for a specialty dry cleaner, be sure to do your research. Duffy says to pay attention to reviews and whether or not the dry cleaner is part of an industry association. If you find that beads or sequins are coming loose over the course of a night out, do your best to collect them and store them somewhere safe so a seamstress can sew them back on later. When you get home, garments covered in sparkling beads or diamantes can pose a particular dilemma when laundering, even for dry cleaners. Sun recommends paying attention to the care label to see if the garment can be spot cleaned or given a light hand wash. Whether you’re spot cleaning or washing the whole garment, Sun says, “please don’t scrub, as this can loosen the beading or sequins”. While the dry cleaner is usually a safe bet, if the garment was insufficiently tested by the manufacturer, Duffy says there is a risk that plastic beading is solvent soluble – meaning it will melt during the cleaning process. He suggests removing any beading and getting someone to re-sew it after cleaning if you are particularly concerned about this. Since tulle is a fine mesh fabric, it’s very easily ripped or snagged, which is something to keep in mind when wearing it and choosing things like accessories (or places to sit). According to Duffy, dry cleaners see a lot of long tulle dresses with heel holes through the hem. Jewellery can be particularly hazardous for tulle too, so be aware of any rings or bracelets that might catch. Tulle can be made of either natural or synthetic fibres, so you should check the care label to see if you should wash or dry clean it. Sun says if you are going to put it in the washing machine, make sure you use a garment bag. If there is a stain on it, she says, “it’s best to soak it in liquid detergent and avoid scrubbing”. The main concern when caring for embroidery is that if it gets wet, the colour from the embroidery could bleed into the main fabric, so it’s important to read the care instructions before putting anything embroidered in the wash. Pay attention to whether the embroidery was done by machine or hand, says Sun, and note the composition of the base fabric to determine if you can wash it at home. Embroidery on a delicate fabric like tulle or silk should be taken to the dry cleaners, but sturdy embroidery on cotton should be OK to hand or machine wash. While wearing anything embroidered, Sun says, “be mindful not to get the embroidery caught on anything, as this will loosen the threads and change the look of the design”. If this does happen, a specialty seamstress might be able to fix it later. Unfortunately, pleats in garments will often soften and fall out after a few wears. Duffy laments for a time when permanent pleating was more common, since it could withstand both wet and dry cleaning. In the absence of this, pleats can be pressed back in. Before doing this, Sun says you should make sure the garment is clean and all stains have been removed, otherwise you will risk setting them in. If you are brave enough to try it at home, Duffy says to use a “low setting on the iron and iron on the reverse side, or use an ironing cloth”. While you can try to re-pleat a garment using an iron at home, Sun says it can be difficult to replicate a professional result. At this point, she recommends “going to the dry cleaners to get it pressed”. Although once upon a time, lace was woven by hand, now, according to Duffy, “most lace today is a polyester base”. That means it can usually be washed or dry cleaned depending on the care instructions. If the lace is particularly delicate, Sun recommends using a garment bag when washing. Once again, she warns against scrubbing, as this may damage or change the lace’s pattern. Mostly, special occasion garments are only worn a few times a year, so storing them is particularly important. Sun says to make sure the garment is clean and free from smells or stains before you put it away, as sweat stains and smells can get worse over time. It’s equally important to ensure any damage has been repaired, as loose threads and tears can also degrade further when a garment is tucked away. To make sure your occasion wear “is safe from dust and moths” Sun recommends keeping it in “a garment bag or sealed box”. Finally, but most importantly: “Don’t forget about it! It is good to check the garment every few months just to see how it is holding up.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Never scrub a sequin!

5/10/2022,"When your opponent is determined for war, history teaches us appeasement does not work. Indeed, unilateral concessions are often counterproductive: they weaken your position and embolden your adversary. Sadly, these are lessons that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, by and large, has failed to learn. Over the past decade of conservative rule, the national broadcaster has been gradually tamed by an unrelenting campaign of bullying, intimidation and delegitimisation. The clearest example is the ABC’s budget. Despite a crystal-clear election promise in 2013 of “no cuts to the ABC”, the national broadcaster is facing $1.2bn of cumulative cuts over a decade. These cuts have felled two television programs that were crucial to government accountability, Lateline and the state-based 7.30 program (once known as Stateline), among many others. Most government ministers, no matter their level of ability, can navigate a short daily press conference or a local radio interview. But you can’t fake your way through a 15-minute grilling on live television where premiers and prime ministers have their mastery of the issues put to the test. Also gone are statewide radio bulletins, digital transcripts and programs like the Media Report, which examined the rapid changes to how information flows in our democracy. The cuts have not stopped at our water’s edge. Our national security has been undermined by the axing of the ABC’s Australia Network, which broadcast high-quality television throughout the Pacific while adding to the ABC’s overall pool of foreign correspondents. Radio Australia’s shortwave radio service – an essential lifeline that amplified our national interests and democratic values to remote Pacific Island countries – has also been axed. And while Australia has retreated, China has spent billions to expand its global media presence with Xi Jinping vowing to “tell Chinese stories well” and “make the voice of China heard”. The Coalition government also exerts control by quietly stacking the ABC’s board with directors hand-picked by the minister, directly ignoring the recommendations of independent merit-based selection processes established under legislation by my government. This includes Ita Buttrose, a former Murdoch editor and Liberal party fundraiser, as its chair. At one stage, five of the eight government-appointed board members were not recommended on merit. These appointments risk affecting decision-making at the highest levels. One apparent example was when Buttrose’s predecessor, Justin Milne, responded to government complaints by demanding journalist Emma Alberici’s head. “They hate her,” Milne reportedly wrote in an email to then managing director Michelle Guthrie. “We are tarred with her brush. I think it’s simple. Get rid of her. We need to save the ABC – not Emma. There is no guarantee they will lose the next election.” Alberici was eventually forced out. Milne denied there had been any interference by the government in the ABC and said the “interests of the ABC have always been utmost in my mind” But the most insidious way the government domesticates the ABC isn’t through budget cuts or board appointments; it is through incessant attacks on the national broadcaster over alleged systemic leftwing bias in its news and current affairs. These attacks have always been fanciful. There have always been prominent conservatives at the ABC. Consider two of the ABC’s recent chief political correspondents: Mark Simkin later became Tony Abbott’s press secretary; Chris Uhlmann was a protege of deeply conservative MP Paul Osborne. Other presenters include Tom Switzer, who sought preselection for the Liberal party and runs the Centre for Independent Studies. Some ABC staff, like Phillip Adams, have been involved in left-of-centre causes over the years. Nonetheless, the Liberal party attacks persist because they serve multiple purposes. First, they delegitimise the ABC, fuelling the idea that reporting that exposes the government’s failures cannot be believed. The ABC’s critics often claim to detest cancel culture, but they would love nothing more than to cancel the ABC. Second, by doing so, the Liberals curry favour with Rupert Murdoch, who has a direct financial stake in undermining public broadcasters, be they the ABC in Australia, PBS and NPR in the United States, or the BBC in the United Kingdom. Murdoch hates any media he can’t control, and he wants the ABC privatised. Third, they normalise the idea that Murdoch’s national stranglehold on print media is OK because it’s merely a rightwing counterbalance to the leftwing ABC. This is ludicrous; the ABC has robust standards, rigorous complaints processes, and is accountable to parliament. News Corporation is functionally unregulated, its political bias is way off the Richter scale, and it acts like a petulant child at the very suggestion that it be compelled to answer questions at commission of inquiry about their monstrous levels of monopoly. The Murdochs insist they have nothing to hide, while claiming the ABC is compromised. If they actually believed this, they would have welcomed a wide-ranging media royal commission years ago. Fourth, and most importantly, the Liberals use these tactics because they subtly condition the ABC’s staff to be hyperconscious about confirming the stereotype. You can see it in the eyes of television reporters who, having caught themselves in the act of saying something that could be construed as vaguely leftwing, will rush to invoke a Coalition talking point (even if they know it is false) or engage in facile “both sides” arguments that draw a false equivalence between the two parties. For example, I have heard ABC journalists dismiss wasteful spending by the Morrison government as merely the cost of rushing money out the door, just as Labor did during the global financial crisis. In reality, there is no equivalence between spending around $850m to fast-track 9,000 school building projects, and the $38bn poured into inflationary jobkeeper overpayments, including to massive corporations that didn’t need it. In this context, I was particularly stunned by last week’s episode of Q+A, which bordered on unwatchable. David Speers’ repeated interruptions of Anthony Albanese seemed designed to prevent him giving complete answers to any of the audience’s questions – let alone to challenge the factually inaccurate narratives implicit in some of them. For example, when Albanese was stepping through Labor’s plan to fix the national disability insurance scheme to a struggling carer, Speers attempted to skewer him with a simplistic interruption about whether Labor policy would involve “getting rid of the bureaucracy or adding to the bureaucracy” – as though the issue turned on the headcount of public servants, rather than the quality of service. Speers then pivoted straight away to the political theatre of whether or not Anthony failed the gotcha question of the day, leaving the questioner – a single mother with two disabled children trapped in a nightmare of mismanagement by an indifferent Liberal government – little closer to understanding what a Labor government would do for her. In the space of 60 minutes, Speers interrupted Albanese on more than 60 occasions. How anyone could watch that program and see leftwing bias is beyond me. Whatever motivated Speers, his approach would not have helped many undecided voters decide which party to support. No level of unfairness to the Labor party will convince the Liberals to stop attacking the ABC, nor will it change Labor’s commitment to the national broadcaster as a cornerstone of our democratic system. Supporting the ABC is part of Labor’s DNA. So what is to be done? One recommendation I have made to the parliament is to enshrine in legislation the ABC’s funding so that it cannot be stood over by future conservative governments. Such legislation would set a minimum level of ABC funding, indexed for the future, which the government could not fall short of without passing legislation through the Senate. Second, the independent selection panels for the ABC must be strengthened. When Labor designed the panels, we did not imagine that a future government would be so brazen in ignoring their recommendations. This could include legally limiting the proportion of directors who could be appointed outside the panel process. Finally, the ABC’s leaders need to toughen up and actually show some leadership in defence of their own institution. They are under attack every single day – whether by the Liberal party, the National party, the Institute of Public Affairs, the Murdoch media, or myriad other arms of the rightwing establishment – and should learn to fight back. The alternative is to continue seeking to appease the far right. And that only ends badly.

5/10/2022,"Peter Dutton’s department says the defence minister is in possession of six reports from the oversight panel regarding the Brereton reforms – but he is yet to disclose any details about what they found. Meanwhile, the Office of the Special Investigator is considering further allegations of war crimes against Australian defence force personnel allegedly committed in Afghanistan, in addition to the matters specifically referred to it for investigation by the Brereton inquiry, a letter tabled in parliament shows. The former defence minister, Linda Reynolds, established an oversight panel in late 2020 to give the Australian community confidence the ADF was putting in place lasting cultural reforms. She promised to report “regularly to the parliament on their reports to me”. But Dutton, who took over as minister in late March 2021, has never spoken about the Brereton reforms in parliament, even though the number of reports from the panel is growing. The chief of the ADF, Gen Angus Campbell, has previously said transparency would be key to the broader reform process. A Defence spokesperson said on Monday night: “The Afghanistan inquiry implementation oversight panel has provided six reports between February 2021 and May 2022.” The panel, headed by former intelligence watchdog Dr Vivienne Thom, reports directly to the defence minister. The timeline suggests that the first report went either to Reynolds or Marise Payne, who acted in the role before Dutton’s appointment. But Dutton has now been defence minister for more than 13 months and would have access to all of the reports. Responding to a question on notice from the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John, the department of defence said the oversight reports were provided every three months but “timing associated with release of the reports and related reporting is a matter for the minister”. Executive director of the Australia Defence Association, Neil James, said the defence minister should keep parliament updated on the progress of implementing the Brereton reforms, with some limits. “It would be helpful – on matters that don’t risk prejudicing a criminal conviction or a disciplinary hearing under the Defence Force Discipline Act – if the minister updated the parliament,” he said. “The first reason is it’s an appropriate thing to do, but the second is it would make discussion of the matter less emotive.” James said updates to parliament would be a “control measure” to ensure reforms were bedded down. He said those responsible for implementing the reforms – both in parliament and outside it – would be held accountable for progress if they knew the commitments were recorded in Hansard. When asked last week why he had not kept the public informed via parliament, Dutton said the issue was “not a plaything” and it would be wrong to comment “on whether a particular investigation is up to a certain stage” or “whether somebody is about to be arrested”. He has also called Guardian Australia a “trashy” publication. But the terms of reference show the panel was asked to focus on Defence issues including the “thoroughness and effectiveness” of the chief of the ADF’s implementation plans. Thom’s panel was required to alert the defence minister of “any challenges and difficulties which may be identified”. Criminal investigations are handled separately by the OSI. Dutton did not respond to written questions on the matter on Monday, but a Defence spokesperson confirmed “neither the terms of reference, nor the panel members have changed since the panel’s terms of reference were finalised in November 2020”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The shadow defence minister, Brendan O’Connor, said the government had “failed to show leadership in its response to the Brereton war crimes report” – but he stopped short of specific commitments. “Federal Labor will keep a very close eye on the process and won’t make unilateral decisions without consultation with the chief of defence force and the department, including as to whether there has been any change in advice between multiple defence ministers,” O’Connor said on Monday. “Labor supports the creation of the Office of the Special Investigator. As there are complex and difficult legal processes underway, a process which will likely take many years, we will need to leave them to be completed and unhindered by political commentary.” A newly released letter shows the OSI assured the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court of “Australia’s resolve to thoroughly and independently investigate, and, where appropriate, prosecute the allegations of criminal offences in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2016 by members of the Australian defence force”. The ICC is known as a court of last resort, meaning that it only acts if domestic processes are not adequate. In the letter dated 18 June 2021, the director general of the OSI, Chris Moraitis, promised a “spirit of cooperative engagement” with the ICC. Moraitis had previously disclosed in Senate estimates that he had written to the ICC, but the full contents of the letter had not been released until the latest round of answers to Senate questions on notice. Moraitis wrote that the agency was taking advice to “ensure investigators only receive information which can lawfully be obtained and used for investigative purposes”. “In the meantime, consistent with its functions, the Office of the Special Investigator is receiving and considering information relevant to allegations of criminal offences by ADF personnel in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016 in addition to the 36 criminal matters recommended for investigation by the IGADF Afghanistan inquiry,” the letter said. Moraitis added: “I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you should you wish to discuss these matters further.” A spokesperson for the OSI said on Monday: “As the director general told the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on 14 February and 31 March 2022, there has been no formal response from the International Criminal Court.”",News/Australia news,Peter Dutton’s department confirms defence minister has six Brereton oversight reports,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/peter-duttons-department-confirms-defence-minister-has-six-brereton-oversight-reports
5/10/2022,"It might surprise you that, as a disabled person, I don’t care if the potential future Labor prime minister can’t recall his own party’s plan for the NDIS. I’m even less concerned that the prime minister feels “blessed” that his kids are not disabled. As we decide who to vote for in under a fortnight, gotcha moments like the one we saw with Anthony Albanese, and debates over whether you are blessed or cursed (resulting from Scott Morrison’s insensitive choice of words, for which he later apologised) distract us from the real issues facing Australians with disabilities and our families. Disabled people find ourselves in a place that we never wanted to be after successfully gaining bipartisan support for a national disability insurance scheme: in fear that the funding we rely on for our basic needs will be pulled out from under us. That we might end up in court against high-priced lawyers and QCs, justifying our existence. And as the rest of Australia gets back to their lives, as if Covid was a distant memory, people like me with lung capacity under 10%, are into our third year of isolation. We must do this to stay alive. But hardly anyone’s talking about that. As the virus runs rampant across Australia, disabled people with underlying medical conditions are at great risk, as our immunity from our booster wanes. So we stay at home. In April, Atagi excluded a vast majority of disabled people in its recommendations regarding a fourth vaccine. Only people living in supported accommodation or who were deemed severely immunocompromised were recommended to receive access to this immunity boost. There is no government program to enable people who are currently housebound to access the flu vaccine. I raised this with governments both state and federal months ago, was assured that there would be a program put in place, but three weeks out from winter my calls have gone unanswered. Most of us are also technically not eligible for Covid treatments because we do not fit the eligibility criteria. I addressed this with the health department and was invited to speak to Atagi which I did, but so far no action. With our health system crumbling and ambulances often unavailable, staying out of the hospital is our highest priority right now, but the government is not making it easy. In fact, there are thousands of disabled people trapped in hospital because they are waiting for housing and support. And not just for a few weeks. A guest on my podcast had been stuck in hospital for almost a year because of delays in NDIS decision-making. We need the government to fix this by committing to reasonable timeframes for NDIS decisions and a streamlined way of appealing decisions without going to court. We need more accessible housing, and standards for a minimum level of accessibility in all new homes. This will enable more people to return to their own homes after they are hospitalised. And the issue that causes the greatest stress for disabled people are the serious workforce shortages. We rely on workers for our most basic needs, but as unemployment has dropped and immigration has slowed, it has become harder than ever to find reliable and appropriately skilled staff with the attitudes and values necessary to do this kind of work. We need to support and encourage more people into the sector by raising pay, improving conditions, and leveraging our visa and immigration policy to bring more people into our country who are committed to working in the disability sector. We continue to be segregated in special schools, abused, neglected, underpaid, over incarcerated and underemployed. So I don’t care if the next prime minister does not have the best memory or feels blessed to not have a child like me. What I do want is a prime minister who will listen to disabled people, and work with us to resolve the many challenges we face not only with the NDIS but also in the many other areas of life where we face death, discrimination and disadvantage.

5/10/2022,"Early polling centres across the country have opened for those unable to vote on Saturday 21 May. Voters in two key Sydney seats were undeterred by the rain on Monday and wasted no time in casting their votes. Guardian Australia asked people who they were voting for – and why. In the marginal seat of Wentworth in Sydney’s east on Monday, a queue of voters spilled from the prepoll centre on Oxford Street in Bondi Junction on to the footpath. The seat is held by the Liberal MP Dave Sharma on a margin of 1.3% and the desperation of his campaign and that of his main challenger, teal independent Allegra Spender, was on display. In a sign of just how close this contest is, Sharma approached and engaged with voters holding Greens material while waiting to vote. A majority of the voters the Guardian observed at the Bondi Junction prepoll centre on Monday skewed toward a more mature demographic that instinctively took Liberal how-to-vote cards. After all, the seat has been held by the Liberals since 1901 for all bar seven months. But many nearby workers used their lunch break to vote and some, such as Petra O’Neill, a Paddington hospitality worker, aren’t backing Sharma. She said she would be working on the Indian Pacific train from Sydney to Perth on 21 May, and therefore cast her vote early on Monday. She voted for Spender. O’Neill voted for Sharma at the 2019 election but says the absence of the prime minister Scott Morrison during the Black Summer bushfires and his record on climate action has swayed her vote. She said Spender was difficult for working-class residents to relate to, but would ultimately serve this demographic better than Sharma and a Coalition government. “I voted for Allegra, but she comes from a very privileged background. I don’t think she’s had as much experience as say, Zali Steggall, but the Liberals have done absolutely nothing for us. I have no faith in ScoMo,” O’Neill said. Sarah* said she thought Sharma and Spender – and the Liberal and Labor parties – had “good ideas and policies”. But she ultimately voted for Sharma “because I went with who would benefit me more and with the Liberals it’s going to be better for me in terms of income tax”. Luke*, who lives near the southern boundary of Wentworth, towards Randwick, said he voted for Sharma because he thought the Liberal party was better at economic management. “The Liberals will be better for me as a business owner,” he said. Asked if Spender’s policies on climate action appealed to him, Luke said “climate is very important to me, especially with daughters, but managing the country is really important too”. “It was balancing those issues and I think I voted for someone who has a party that can actually win the election.” Malcolm Smith, a Bondi Junction local, was one voter not swayed by corflutes and volunteers handing out flyers for Sharma and Spender. The self-described “crypto hound” voted for the United Australia party candidate Natalie Dumer. He preferenced Sharma ahead of Spender because he followed the UAP how-to-vote material. “The other parties let us down over the past two and half years, so I had to give it to somebody outside of the two-party system,” Smith said. “I never thought I’d actually vote for Clive Palmer or someone like Pauline Hanson, but I just don’t think we’ve been able to have discussions about Covid. “Einstein said madness is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result – and I’m fed up with the two parties we’ve only ever had in government.” Both candidates were handing out how-to-vote material and talking to voters on Monday. Spender was also handing out Minties and Freddo frogs to her small army of volunteers wearing teal-coloured T-shirts. Across Sydney Harbour in the electorate of North Sydney, the Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman was on Monday attempting to win over voters at the Northside Conference Centre in St Leonards. Zimmerman, a moderate, holds the seat with a 9.3% margin but is under threat because the federal Liberal party and Morrison are considered on-the-nose. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Both Zimmerman and the Labor candidate, Catherine Renshaw, greeted voters at the entrance to the voting centre. Climate 200-backed independent Kylea Tink is the favoured challenger, but was isolating with Covid on Monday. Tink and another prominent candidate, Victor Kline of the TNL party (formerly known as the New Liberals), had several volunteers handing out material. Of the voters the Guardian observed at the centre, a significant chunk took only Labor how-to-vote material, and recognised Renshaw from her campaign. But Andy*, a business owner in St Leonards, said he voted for Zimmerman because he thought a Liberal government would be better for his manufacturing business. “It’s not anything against Labor policy, but it’s because we’ve been able to achieve a lot the past two years,” he said. Waverton voter Harriet* lives in Zimmerman’s old flat, but that connection was not enough to sway her decision on Monday. She voted for Tink. “I know Trent is a nice guy, but the poor bugger happens to belong to the wrong party. This is the party where the assistant minister for women went to an anti-abortion rally,” Harriet said, referring to Amanda Stoker. “The intellectual and ethical standard between the two major parties, especially with ScoMo, is beyond repugnant. I just want to see the guy humiliated, because there seems to be this ongoing persecution of anyone who didn’t go to the right school or who isn’t a straight male.” *some voters requested their surnames not be published.",News/Australia news,‘The poor bugger belongs to the wrong party’: voters cast early ballots in two key Sydney seats,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/the-poor-bugger-belongs-to-the-wrong-party-voters-cast-early-ballots-in-two-key-sydney-seats
5/10/2022,"When Matt Dwyer, a panel beater, and his wife, Tracy, bought their South Lismore business in 2006 they were told the 40-year-old workshop had only ever had about 15cm of flood water across the concrete floor. Over the next decade the couple repaired thousands of cars, employed local people, trained apprentices, sponsored the local footy team and the go-kart club and raised three children. They also spent what they estimate as $1m on equipment. After being partially inundated by flood waters in 2017, the couple prepared a comprehensive flood plan to handle future events. Or so they thought. “We implemented our flood plan, we came in here on the Sunday [27 February, before this year’s first flood], we lifted everything up, we have a mezzanine floor, we got all the customers’ cars out,” Tracy says. But their preparations were in vain when a wall of water – 3.5 metres high – swept through the workshop, submerging most of their equipment in the process. Tracy, 48, and Matt, 52, estimate their losses at about $500,000. Insurance companies had refused them flood cover, they say, and while they had business interruption insurance, they have since discovered it did not cover flooding. What they are eligible to apply for is a $50,000 small business grant from the NSW state government which, while welcome, is considerably less than the $200,000 soon to be available to businesses with more than 20 employees. “I don’t think the grant criteria should be based around staff numbers because the cost of plant and equipment here is so expensive to replace and repair, and that’s not being taken into account,” Tracy says. The couple are not alone in questioning the criteria, speed and bureaucracy involved in the state government’s business grants program. Jane Laverty is the regional manager of Business NSW – Northern Rivers, which operates as a chamber of commerce for the area. She has supported about 200 affected businesses through a hub based at Lismore’s Southern Cross University, alongside Service NSW and the Rural Assistance Authority. She agrees it doesn’t make sense for flood grant amounts to be decided based on employee numbers, not on the damages a business had suffered. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “That doesn’t seem fair in anyone’s mind, and we have certainly been speaking to the different agencies and giving them these case studies so they can understand the challenges and those that may fall through the gaps,” she says. Many other small businesses are struggling to survive while chasing down the paperwork required for the grant. Meanwhile, it is 10 weeks after the floods and a grant of up to $200,000 for medium-sized businesses with more than 20 employees is yet to open for applications. “There really is no time to lose now because businesses are bleeding every single day of costs and if we want businesses to come back … that means getting some funds in bank accounts and a plan to move forward,” Laverty says. According to Service NSW, of the 14,964 applications lodged for the small business grant less than 15% have so far been approved. Nearly 40% have been rejected, and a further 36% sent back to applicants for further information. Kylie O’Reilly and her husband, Matt, invested their life savings in a mushroom farm near Evans Head 15 months ago. Their six-acre mushroom farm was returning a profit and employed 12 local people. The floods knocked down 12 of the property’s 15 sheds and 1.7 metres of water engulfed the couple’s home – they were rescued by boat. They estimate their losses at more than $1m, having also been deemed ineligible for insurance. The couple, both in their 40s, have applied for three flood grants (business and primary producer), as well as the 13-week no-income payment. They were rejected for three of the four, while one flood grant application is still pending. According to the office of the NSW agriculture minister, Dugald Saunders, about one-third of applications for the $25,000 and $75,000 grants have so far been approved. That equates to about 90 of 266 applications for the smaller grant and 680 of the 2,332 applications for the $75,000. “The NSW government is working as quickly as possible to complete the high volume of special disaster grants applications,” Saunders said. Kylie described the grant process as “messy” and lamented the lack of communication between government agencies. “Matt and I lived in Switzerland for 10 years and neither of us spoke French, but living in that country was easier than coming back, going through a natural disaster where we lose everything, and trying to rebuild ourselves,” she says. “We are stuck. We are both wanting to get on with life and make decisions about whether to rebuild the farm, but we don’t have $1m in our back pocket. “You can’t imagine the mental stress this causes. We are trying to do the business and trying to get ourselves back into our home.” Many of their staff are also without an income and some, aged in their 60s, can’t find new jobs. Kylie and Matt are currently living in a caravan. The Lismore state MP, Labor’s Janelle Saffin, says grant processing needs to be faster and the grant criteria, including a focus on counting employee numbers, must be reviewed. “I think it should be on damage,” she says. Saffin has also been critical of the off-farm income rule – making some farmers ineligible for producer grants if spouses earn more than 50% of their couple’s income from anything that isn’t the farm’s primary produce. Many farmers have partners working off-farm. “It just does not recognise the nature of farming in our region,” she says A spokesperson for the NSW department of primary industries said a Rural Landholders Grant had been developed, which could provide assistance to those who do not meet the 50% on-farm income criteria. For the O’Reillys and others around Lismore, though, it is the range of grants being managed by different departments, with different criteria, that can lead to confusion. The Greens NSW upper house member Sue Higginson, who lives in Lismore, said the difficulty accessing grants was compounding trauma and preventing recovery. The NSW minister for emergency services and resilience, Stephanie Cooke, directed questions from the Guardian to Service NSW, who said teams have been working seven days a week to assess applications as quickly as possible. They pointed out nearly 94% of small business grant applications have been processed. Asked about the nearly 6,000 business grant applications so far rejected, a spokesperson said “ineligible applications include those who have not provided evidence that they are operating in a flood-impacted suburb or that their business assets or equipment have suffered direct damage”. The Dwyers reopened their workshop for the first time last week, using up all of their retirement savings to get machinery fixed and the building rewired. “I feel like this is worse than starting from scratch,” Tracy says. “It feels like we are starting all over again, but we are starting with a heap of damaged equipment and there is so much uncertainty.” With their adult son also working in the business, the couple had been thinking they would soon be able to wind down their work commitments and take the odd trip away. “We’re at a point where we should be working four days a week, not seven,” says Matt. “And Lismore is now just an empty shell … our business depends on other businesses.”",News/Australia news,‘You can’t imagine the mental stress’: flooded Lismore business owners call for grants overhaul,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/you-cant-imagine-the-mental-stress-flooded-lismore-business-owners-call-for-grants-overhaul

He is also a loving husband and father to the family, He is also a federal MP who speaks for Kooyong. He is also an outstanding Australian Treasurer in everyone’s eyes.” It’s not the only positive profile that is currently circulating among the Mandarin-speaking community on WeChat, the internet platform which is some times referred to as a Swiss army knife application: a mega app combining the functionality of Facebook, WhatsApp, instant messaging, Uber and PayPal. Australian Financial News, another news site on the platform, ran a piece comparing Frydenberg to General John Monash, riffing off the fact that they both have Jewish heritage. It has been published twice, in February and again in April, surrounded by ads from Josh Frydenberg. “Frydenberg has demonstrated the ability of the trinity of legal, financial and political skills, coupled with the foundation of Australian barristers and the physical quality of athletes, he has become an indispensable part of successive governments,” the profile says. “The effort included a few months ago when he defeated Facebook and Google, two of the world’s largest and most arrogant multinationals, and Frydenberg won the world’s attention.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It ends by declaring that Fydenberg “is working tirelessly to carry on the legacy of his his Jewish predecessor, the brilliant strategist who turned the tide of World War I.” In the battle for Kooyong in inner Melbourne, the votes of Chinese-Australians will be critical and what is being circulated online may well take on added significance. The 2016 census revealed people with Chinese heritage made up 11.6% of Kooyong, and that number has likely increased. Three-quarters are Mandarin speakers. A UComms poll of 847 residents conducted on 12 April for Climate 200 found independent candidate Monique Ryan held a 59% to 41% two-party preferred lead over Frydenberg. But there must be a question mark over whether robo-polling picks up non-English speaking voters. The rosy profiles of Frydenberg may raise eyebrows for their obsequiousness but they are being backed up with hard cash from the treasurer’s campaign, which is spending thousands of dollars for banner advertisements on these news sites. Asked about their presence on WeChat, a spokesperson for the treasurer said: “The treasurer does not have an active WeChat account.” “There is no payment for articles,” she said. While Frydenberg may not be using his own WeChat account, his campaign team has been particularly active in using WeChat groups like AAN and Melbourne Online CN2MEL to recruit Chinese-speaking volunteers to the campaign. A person can subscribe to a group by scanning a QR code and the ads invite volunteers to join groups to campaign for Frydenberg. The recruitment advertisements have been appearing under the national Covid update and the Shanghai Covid update, two of the most well-read articles on AAN. It is unclear who operates AAN. It used to be the official news partner of Tencent, the owner of WeChat, but the site parted company and now operates separately. The editor is David Liu, but who is behind the site is opaque. AFN is owned by David Han, a property investor who was previously part owner of Sydney Today, part of the larger Australian Chinese Media Today group. Han’s site has just got back to regular posting after a hiatus in the wake of a defamation suit in which AFN paid out $350,000 in 2020 to former Macquarie banker Guy Hedley, who now heads Sydney-based funds manager Atlas Advisors. In contrast to the gentle treatment of Josh Frydenberg, AAN has been far more probing of the independent candidate, Monique Ryan. “The ‘independent candidate’ in the Victorian Chinese constituency challenges the Australian Treasurer, but is she really ‘independent’?,” the headline reads on one of the few articles about her. The article itself reproduced a translated version of the Herald Sun’s story which said “The self-proclaimed independent candidate … regularly posted privately on social media about her love for Labor Party legends, raising fresh questions about her political leanings.” Ryan has also been engaging with the Chinese media, doing a video interview with “Tianhua News” a much smaller site, more akin to a blogger site. The presenter interviewed Ryan via an interpreter on issues including her stance on climate change, why she was running against Frydenberg and Australia’s relationship with China. Although one of the slides featured the Herald Sun article on Ryan’s previous Labor affiliations, the interviewer did not ask about this subject. A spokesman for Ryan’s campaign acknowledged that the Chinese-speaking Australian community would be important in Kooyong. “We have noticed just how prolific Mr Frydenberg is in the Chinese media sector. That profile left us scratching our heads,” he said. The spokesman said Ryan’s campaign had plans for more outreach to the local Chinese speaking community.",News/Australia news,‘Josh Frydenberg for PM’: stories in Chinese circulating on WeChat are positively gushing over the treasurer,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/josh-frydenberg-for-pm-stories-in-chinese-circulating-on-wechat-are-positively-gushing-over-the-treasurer
5/10/2022,"Peak healthcare bodies in Victoria are calling for real-time data on emergency departments, warning hospital staff are being forced to work “blind” amid unprecedented pressure on the system. The state’s overcrowded emergency departments have resulted in patients increasingly waiting more than 24 hours before being transferred to an inpatient bed. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine has labelled the situation in hospitals across the country a “national emergency”, and it’s Victorian chair, Dr Mya Cubitt, said hospitals needed a statewide dashboard with real-time data. Cubitt said the data would allow emergency departments across the state to better work together and improve patient safety, and should be made public. “In Victoria, we are working really blind, especially in the area of emergency medicine,” she said. “We don’t have good visibility of the patients who are in ED. We don’t have good visibility of the workforce and bed availability [in] our EDs. And therefore, we can’t all together, see where the overcrowding is occurring.” The Australian Medical Association’s Victorian president, Dr Roderick McRae, said real-time data was “logical.” “I support the ability for people to say, ‘well I normally got to this hospital but it’s an eight-hour wait, but over there it’s a two-and-a-half-hour wait’,” he said. “The provision of information empowers them to make a rational decision in their circumstances at that moment.” Cubitt said the biggest issue was the lack of flow of patients from the emergency department into other hospital wards. When patients are unable to move to a ward due to a shortage of staffed beds, emergency departments become overcrowded and ambulances could spend hours waiting outside, unable to respond to other call-outs. “What we’re finding in Victoria is that … the length of time people are spending in an emergency department is becoming really unsafe,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Cubitt said it was becoming increasingly common for patients to be staying longer than 24 hours in the state’s emergency departments. “We don’t think that it is safe for anyone who needs to be in a hospital to be in an emergency department for more than 12 hours,” she said. Cubitt said the state’s hospitals were “moving into a phase of disaster-style medicine” where they were “trying to do the most for the most, rather than give the care that we would like to give”. “That’s a really horrible place for us all to feel that we are, but that is where we are,” she said. On Sunday night, the Royal children’s hospital issued a statement on its Facebook page saying its emergency department was experiencing a high volume of patients and encouraging people to visit their local hospital. The Victorian Healthcare Association – the peak body for public hospitals – said hospitals had increasingly turned to social media posts as “quick and effective” way to share health information during the pandemic. The association’s chief executive, Tom Symondson, said the pandemic was still being felt across the state’s health system despited the eased restrictions. “Our public health and ambulance services are still managing extremely high demand for emergency care, while delivering other necessary healthcare,” Symondson said. “Cases remain stubbornly high at around 10,000 cases a day, and around 500 people are in hospital with Covid-19. The system is also facing significant workforce shortages, with thousands of healthcare workers furloughed every day due to Covid-19.” The Victorian government announced last week that it would spend $12bn to repair its Covid-battered health system, with $2.9bn budgeted for new health infrastructure.",News/Australia news,‘We’re working blind’: health groups call for live data on emergency departments in Victoria,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/were-working-blind-health-groups-call-for-live-data-on-emergency-departments-in-victoria
5/10/2022,"When Allery Sandy flew over Yindjibarndi country in a plane for the first time, it stirred something deep and ancient inside her. A sea of Mulla Mulla (pink wildflowers) swelled across the rocky tablelands, where Dreaming stories are carved into the landscape and a network of waterways crawl towards the Fortescue River. It was at that moment Sandy knew she wanted to paint her ngurra (country). “I said to my husband, ‘If I ever get my hands on a big enough canvas, I will paint all the beauty that is down below’,” she says. A respected elder working with the Yinjaa-Barni art collective, today Sandy is renowned for her sublimely detailed aerial paintings of her homelands. Like many Pilbara artists, country is the locus and heart of her practice, both storyteller and muse; weaving a literature of the land that reveals Aboriginal ways of seeing and a commitment to passing down cultural knowledge. Her paintings are hanging alongside the work of more than 70 artists in Tracks We Share: Contemporary Art of the Pilbara at the Art Gallery of Western Australia (AGWA). The largest ever survey of Pilbara Aboriginal art, the exhibition celebrates the region’s expansive artistic output and the stories, language and songlines that connect its people. Born of a desire to build the capacity and prominence of the Pilbara’s art sector, the three-year project is a collaboration between FORM, AGWA and Aboriginal art centres Cheeditha Art Group, Juluwarlu Art Group, Martumili Artists, Spinifex Hill Studio, and Yinjaa-Barni Art, and a number of individual artists. While the Pilbara is home to the world’s oldest concentration of petroglyphic rock art, its contemporary arts sector is relatively underdeveloped, owing in part to the ascendency of the resources sector, FORM senior curator Andrew Nicholls says. “The Pilbara is such an incredibly diverse and rich art hub – and it’s not really known for that. It’s kind of been eclipsed by the mining industry,” he says. “On the other hand, mining executives became a willing, eager market for Pilbara artwork, so a lot of artists never felt the need to really push themselves or expand their practices.” It’s a conundrum that FORM and its project partners, which include AGWA, the WA government, BHP and Woodside, set out to shift with Tracks We Share, providing economic, professional and cultural development to bolster the art centre model which has seen great success in other parts of Australia. This included commissions, residences, workshops, mentorships and on-country activities, as well as significant documentation of the region’s art movement which has resulted in a rich archive. The support of the extractive industries is an irony presumably not lost on the exhibiting artists, many of whom make bold political statements through their art about cultural dispossession and the exploitation of natural resources. As curator and author Dr Stephen Gilchrist astutely puts it in the exhibition’s catalogue: “It is one thing to champion Indigenous art, but it is equally essential to protect Indigenous cultural sites. One exists because of the other and for the other.” Jill Churnside is an Ngarluma artist who tackles uncomfortable truths head-on. Her work Washing Day is an Australian flag drenched in heavy lashings of white paint and hung out to dry, referencing the painful histories of the White Australia policy and the stolen generations. Another of her works, Country in Bloom, appears to be an innocuous depiction of wildflowers – but it pays homage to the traditional owners of Murujuga who were decimated in a bloody conflict with white colonists in the 19th century. “It’s important, those stories have to be told,” she says. “We can’t paint pretty pictures all the time.” Juluwarlu Art Group’s video installation Ngundamurri features a ngunda (corroboree), marking the first time in living memory such a ritual has taken place on Yindjibarndi country. Wearing white body paint and red bandanas adorned with feathers, the all-male group breathe new life into the traditional dances of their ancestors, while carrying delicately carved Jarnyjin (dancing sticks), made by law man and elder Wayne Stevens. “Juluwarlu love working collaboratively,” Nicholls says. “They are the youngest art centre in the region but they are so proactive and such a tightknit group. If you ask one of them to do something, 20 of them will turn up.” Known as “the great poet of the pastoral industry”, Mr Nyaparu (William) Gardiner , who died in 2018, painted his memories of growing up around the time of the Pilbara strike in 1946, when almost 1,000 unpaid Aboriginal pastoral workers walked off the job, demanding the minimum weekly wage of 30 shillings. With its mellifluous landscapes rendered in subtle pinks and oranges, Cattlemen in the Pilbara reflects a nostalgic yearning for Mr Gardiner’s “old people”, including his father who was a cattleman. A late starter in the art world, Mr Gardiner painted with Spinifex Hill Studio for the final five years of his life. The exhibition concludes with the energetic acrylic and oil painting of the Martumili Artists, representing the Martu people whose homelands spread across remote stretches of the Western Desert. Kintyre, a painting made by a group of more than 20 artists, pulsates with a joyous and life-affirming love of country. A green section at the top right of the canvas denotes the Kintyre mine site, land on Martu country that was seized by Rio Tinto in 2008 to create one of the world’s largest uranium explorations. The proposed site is connected underground to Lake Dora, a saltwater lake of great significance to the Martu people. “This is a protest painting,” says Martumili artist Desmond Taylor. “We’re hoping to get back the land that was taken away from us. This is our story, this is our home, this is our way of finding connection to country.” Led by Martu elders Muuki Taylor and the late Mr Wokka Taylor, Kintyre was made by young and old, coming together to craft an intimate network of memory and place – a testament to the spirit of kinship that permeates Martu country, and the vast landmass of the Pilbara. “The region is home to such a diverse community of artists from different language groups and cultural backgrounds,” says Nicholls. “But they are sharing their stories together, and walking side-by-side, on their creative journey through country.” Tracks We Share: Contemporary Art of the Pilbara is on at AGWA until 28 August.",Arts/Art and design,‘This is a protest painting’: Aboriginal artists speak out in show backed by mining giants,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/10/this-is-a-protest-painting-aboriginal-artists-speak-out-in-show-backed-by-mining-giants
5/10/2022,"Reforms to reduce the use of grants for pork-barrelling need to be enacted before next March’s state election if the New South Wales government wants to protect its credibility, crossbenchers and a former supreme court judge have said. A chorus of crossbenchers have demanded the premier, Dominic Perrottet, introduce legislation in coming months based on the grants-reform recommendations handed to the government at the weekend. Their call has been backed by the retired supreme court judge and chair of the Centre for Public Integrity, Anthony Whealy QC, who said it would put the state in a leading role in the fight for greater transparency in government spending. Whealy was buoyed up by the findings of the review carried out by the Department of Premier and Cabinet and the state’s productivity commissioner, Peter Achterstraat, as well as the government’s initial response. He said he was “confident” Perrottet would implement “at least a majority of these recommendations”, even though no commitments have yet been made. “I’m therefore very hopeful that we’re going to see pork-barreling cleaned up in NSW, at least,” Whealy said, noting the federal system had a long way to go. He said acting on the recommendations “would put NSW well ahead … to be the leader” in administering public money in such a way. On Saturday, Perrottet said grants were significant part of public spending – from Covid support to money for community sporting centres and flood recovery. He said the government would respond to the recommendations “in the coming weeks”. The review of grant processes was announced last year when the former premier Gladys Berejiklian gave evidence to the state’s anti-corruption watchdog that the government “threw money at seats to keep them”. It made 19 recommendations, including measures to get better value for public money and to create more robust, transparent and accountable processes. It also recommended all grant guidelines be published and administrators should document when ministers and politicians try to influence grants processes, rather than making pork-barrelling a criminal offence. The Coalition government has a minority in the lower house and has to rely on crossbench support to pass legislation. It does not control the upper house. The independent crossbencher Greg Piper said the report was a “really good start” and was supportive of the recommendation to allow transparent ministerial discretion. “In my time I’ve seen lots of things that have a very high value to the community but may not fit the criteria perfectly – and that … allows for that,” Piper said. “It’s got to be documented, articulated as to why there was a departure [from the guidelines]. So, at first glance, I think it’s good.” But he warned the premier against delaying implementation. “It goes to his credibility,” Piper said. “If he drags his feet, that that could certainly be causing problems in future.” Fellow independent MP Alex Greenwhich said reform was needed before the next poll. “I do hope that they are able to implement the required transparency processes before the next election,” he said. “There’s probably a lot that the federal government could learn from these recommendations as well.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The crossbench MP Mark Banasiak said clearer processes and judgments would benefit community groups who had been left wondering why they missed out on money. “If there was that transparency about how they were judged, if they had that feedback, then they could improve for next time,” he said. Banasiak said the government should have acted on grant spending integrity years ago. The opposition leader, Chris Minns, said reform was “long overdue”. “Greater transparency and accountability will improve the grants process, and restore faith and confidence of New South Wales taxpayers in the system.”",News/Australia news,Hopes that an overhaul of NSW grants processes to see ‘pork-barrelling cleaned up’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/growing-hope-for-an-overhaul-of-the-nsw-grants-syst-to-see-pork-barrelling-cleaned-up
