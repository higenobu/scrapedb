4/12/2022,"An elderly woman in Washington who was accused of a hate crime against her Vietnamese neighbor last year has agreed to sell her home to pay the victim $45,000.

Jan Myers, 72, was charged with a hate crime on Thursday for harassing her neighbor Thi Pham in April 2021.

Pham’s lawyers announced that Myers has agreed to a civil settlement dictating that she must attempt to sell her home in Shoreline, Washington, and pay Pham $45,000 from the home's sale.

Pham and her husband Bill Healy’s lawyers filed a lawsuit against Myers in August 2021 after they said she had been repeatedly harassing and threatening their family, with some incidents even captured on video.

Pham said Myers started harassing them when she was working in her garden in April last year. Myers reportedly made threats and was caught on video referring to Pham as “slant eye.” Pham started recording the incident using her phone, catching Myers yelling, “Hey Miss Vietnam... you're not going to live very long.”

Healy, who called the incident “devastating,” said Myers had also exposed herself to his wife and their 2-year-old son, which was also caught on camera. As the family filed their lawsuit, Pham said she no longer felt safe in their home.

The family’s lawyers called the civil settlement a victory for victims of racial harassment.

“We need to make the people who are harassing people because of their race pay and make them pay the victim,” said lawyer Jeffery Campiche.

Under the settlement, Myers has agreed to sell her home in the next six months and pay Pham $45,000 from the sale.

Should Myers fail to sell the home and move as agreed, Pham’s lawsuit against Myers will proceed to trial and potentially be decided by a jury.

“I am happy that I can safely live in my home without racial harassment,” Pham was quoted as saying by KGW. “We hope Jan Myers follow [sic] through the agreement and move quickly.”

While the civil settlement has been agreed to, Myers may still face criminal charges for her threatening behavior, for which a trial is tentatively set to begin on June 8. Enjoy this content?

4/12/2022,"You may remember back in 2020 when South Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravsnborg made news for hitting and killing a man with his car. The incident made national news, albeit briefly, and Ravsnborg got off easy. He was charged with a few misdemeanors for which he paid fines, never appeared in court, and — despite calls to resign from Governor Kristi Noem — stayed in office. In fact, he’s now running for re-election. So goes the modern Republican Party. The Daily Beast reported on Monday, however, that the South Dakota GOP may have finally had it with Ravsnborg. State lawmakers last Wednesday were provided with new information about the incident in 2020, leading an increasing number of Republicans to favor impeachment. “I now have irrefutable evidence the AG knew exactly what he hit and lied to investigators and the Hyde County sheriff,” Republican state Rep. Charlie Hoffman, who had been unsure whether to impeach Ravnsborg but now supports it, told the Daily Beast.

He hit, and killed, a man named Joe Boever. Ravnsborg called 911 after the accident and said he hit something in the middle of the road. Hyde County Sheriff Mike Volek responded to the call, and lent Ravnsborg his personal car to finish the drive home. Volek later admitted that he didn’t search very hard for Boever’s body, which was discovered the following day after Ravnsborg returned to the scene. Toxicology reports show that Ravnsborg was not under the influence at the time of the crash, but he does have a history of careless driving. Less than two months before he killed Ravnsborg, he almost crashed into a police car after swerving over a lane boundary, forcing the officer to slam on his brakes to avoid being hit, according to a police report. Last August, he was issued his seventh speeding ticket in two years. He has also admitted he was on his phone looking at a story about Joe Biden and China just before he killed Boever. The presentation from the South Dakota Highway Patrol last week appears to contradict Ravnsborg’s account of the events, at least according to Hoffman and other lawmakers. It turns out that Ravnsborg drove with Boever on his vehicle for at least 100 feet, and that Boever’s head was through Ravnsborg’s windshield (Boever’s glasses were even found inside Ravnsborg’s car). Boever’s body eventually fell off on the vehicle, leg severed. He had died on impact. “After seeing the length of time Mr. Boever’s body was on the AG’s car with his head inside of the AG’s car’s window, and then flying off hitting the middle of the lane behind the AG’s car, leaving bone fragments on the road and skidding into the ditch at 65 mph, my mind has changed,” Hoffman told the Daily Beast of his decision to support impeachment. The troopers also said they believed Ravnsborg did not hit Boever in the middle of the road, as Ravnsborg had claimed. “The area of impact was so far off the roadway, it takes him so long to stop, as we described,” Patrol Troopers John Berndt said on Wednesday, according to the Daily Beast. “The amount of evidence found in the vehicle and around where the impact happened—we don’t know what happened, we just know it wasn’t normal.” Republican state Rep. Fred Deutsch also told the Daily Beast he now supports impeachment, calling it perhaps “the most difficult decision I’ve had to make in my life.” Several other Republicans want to boot Ravnsborg out of office, as well, as does Noem. “Like many South Dakotans, I am not only disappointed in how this process was handled by prosecutors, but outraged at the result of today’s plea hearing and sentencing,” she said last August after Ravnsborg pleaded his way out of standing trial. “Ravnsborg has not accepted responsibility for the death of Joseph Boever and did not even appear in court today to face the charges or the Boever family. ” Thirty-six of the state’s 70 House representatives would need to vote in favor of impeaching Ravnsborg for the matter to move to the state Senate.

4/12/2022,"A fun evening out at the Clay County Agricultural Fair took a horrifying turn Friday night in Green Cove Springs, Florida. A carnival worker fell through the collapsible floor of The Hydra and was pinned in tightly between two large slats for about 15 minutes. Bystander Aurelia Smith’s cellphone video shows the man, later identified as 28-year-old Davontai Lee, struggling as people scramble around him. Only the top half of the operator’s body can be seen, the bottom half swallowed up in metal. “Has somebody called 911 yet?!” a woman screams off camera. According to cops, Lee was trying to do a “good deed” — retrieve a customer’s hat that had somehow fallen from the Hydra — just as the ride’s floor gave way. Exotic dancer claimed to be cousin of Orlando ride victim. Not true. Now she’s fired. Chief Jeff Johnson with the Clay County Sheriff’s Office told media the incident occurred due to “bad timing.” “There were no problems with the function of the ride,” Johnson said in a statement. ”The ride had nothing to do with this. The ride is functioning properly.” The operator, who was briefly hospitalized, said he was thankful to be alive: “Thank God I’m still here on the earth right now,” wrote Lee in a Facebook post on Sunday. “I thought I was gone, but God had me covered and I appreciate everyone who sent out prayers for me.” Just last month, a Missouri teen died after falling from his seat on the ICON Park Free Fall in Orlando.

4/12/2022,"(Reuters) -Authorities in four Russian regions bordering Ukraine and in Russian-controlled Crimea announced they were stepping up security measures on Monday over what they said were ""possible provocations"" from the Ukrainian side. Moscow, which sent thousands of troops into Ukraine in what it calls a ""special military operation"", has accused Ukraine of targeting its border regions, including by striking a fuel depot in the city of Belgorod earlier this month. The authorities in the Belgorod, Voronezh, Bryansk and Krasnodar regions and in Crimea said they were boosting security and urged citizens to be more vigilant. Another region bordering Ukraine, Kursk, was the first to announce similar measures on Sunday. ""During the special operation by Russian forces on the territory of Ukraine, the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, issues pertaining to anti-terrorist security have become more pressing due to possible provocations from Ukrainian nationalists,"" said Alexander Gusev, the governor of the Voronezh region, which shares a border with Ukraine's Luhansk region. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, said it would implement additional security measures until April 25 to counter what he called terrorist threats. The region borders Ukraine's Sumy, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions. Gladkov said the population should steer clear of crowded public places, carry identity documents on them, have an evacuation plan and pay special attention to strangers and unusual vehicles near residential buildings. The Bryansk region, which shares a border with Ukraine's Sumy and Chernihiv regions, said it was also on alert for terrorist threats. The governors of the Krasnodar region, across the Sea of Azov from east Ukraine, and of Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, said they were raising ""terrorism alerts"" and would strengthen law enforcement in several districts. On Sunday, the governor of the Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, said police and military officers would set up checkpoints, less than a week after border guards allegedly came under fire in the region. Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.
