3/8/2022,"Actors Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman gave Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""Spirit Awards salute"" on Sunday, but it's not what you think. The husband-and-wife duo, who hosted the 37th Film Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica, flipped off the Russian autocrat for his ongoing attack of Ukraine and irreverently told him to ""f— off."" Also sending ""best wishes"" to the Ukrainian people, the hosts brought attention to the fatal conflict, which has displaced more than 1.3 million Ukrainians since Putin launched the invasion on Feb. 24. ""I think we speak for everyone here when we say that we are hoping for a quick, peaceful resolution,” Mullally said during the show, according to Variety. ""Specifically, f— off and go home, Putin!” Echoing his wife, ""Pam & Tommy"" actor Offerman added: “We hope Putin f— off and goes home. And to that end, let’s all join together with a Spirit Awards salute to Putin."" That salute, of course, involved sticking their middle fingers up at the camera — a moment already immortalized in a gif. ""Will & Grace"" veteran Mullally also asked attendees and TV viewers to donate to ""great organizations"" that are raising money for the besieged nation. ""Please give what you can to give to the victims of this senseless act of aggression,"" she said. On Monday, Russia and Ukraine attempted another limited cease-fire to allow civilians to escape four of Ukraine's beleaguered cities amid deep distrust that Russian forces would honor the pledge as they hammered strategic centers across the country.

3/8/2022,"Former national security aide Alexander Vindman accused Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and others of having ""blood on their hands"" as Ukraine withstands a withering assault from Russian troops. In an interview with the Journal Sentinel, Vindman included Johnson on a list with former President Donald Trump, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, claiming they undermined U.S. national security. ""Civilians are dying, Ukrainians are providing a formidable defense, defending democracy for Americans as well as for themselves and their homes. And Ron Johnson is trying to distract and obfuscate,"" Vindman said. Vindman was responding to comments made Feb. 27 by Johnson on Fox News. Vindman had been with Johnson on a key trip to Ukraine in May 2019, in which the senator sought to assure the newly elected government of congressional support. Subscribe to our On Wisconsin Politics newsletter for the week's political news explained. A retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, Vindman also blamed Johnson and others for ending his military career. Vindman was a key witness in the first U.S. House impeachment of Trump. He listened in on the 2019 call when Trump asked Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Joe Biden while withholding U.S. military aid to the country. Trump later released about $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. Last week, in an interview with Fox News, Johnson blamed Vindman and others for helping embolden Russian president Vladimir Putin. ""I don't think Vladimir Putin would have moved on Ukraine were it not for the weakness displayed ― certainly by the Biden administration, but by the West in general,"" Johnson said in the interview. ""I'm certainly hoping that Col. Vindman, Adam Schiff, Nancy Pelosi ― who used Ukraine as a pawn in their impeachment travesty ― are also recognizing and reflecting about how they weakened Ukraine, weakened the West, weakened America by the divisive politics that they play."" ""There's much blame to go around, but in terms of atrocities, that falls squarely on the shoulders of Vladimir Putin and his cronies,"" Johnson said. According to a statement from his office, Johnson stands behind his Fox News comments. In addition, the statement asserted, Pelosi, Schiff and Vindman ""weakened Ukraine by harming its relationship with the U.S. and therefore made Ukraine more vulnerable to Russian aggression, destabilization efforts, and ultimately invasion. ""Lt. Col Vindman’s actions demonstrated disloyalty to both the U.S. President he served and the Ukrainian people we were trying to help,"" the statement from his office said. Vindman, who is a senior advisor for the liberal group Vote Vets, countered that Johnson was ""a huge disappointment"" on the Ukraine issue. ""He's responsible more so than many of his colleagues for creating a situation in which the U.S. actually might find itself in a hot war,"" Vindman said. Asked if Johnson believed he held any responsibility for what is now occurring in Ukraine, the senator's office responded: ""Absolutely not. Senator Johnson has been consistently supportive of the people of Ukraine who want to rid their nation of corruption and live in freedom, peace, and prosperity."" Johnson's office noted the senator has made seven trips to Ukraine since 2011 and co-sponsored multiple resolutions and bills in support of Ukraine. The Ukrainian-born Vindman and Johnson have a history. ""There was a time when I thought he was a good actor, a good guy,"" Vindman said. They were in the Ukraine capital of Kyiv in May 2019 as part of the U.S. delegation attending Zelensky's inauguration. ""I tried to make him feel at home, make him feel welcome,"" Vindman said. He recalled having a conversation with Johnson. ""He was pretty aggressive in providing support for Ukraine in arming the Ukrainians, giving this new president d everything you need to resist Russian coercion at that point, Russian aggression in a war that had been unfolding for the preceding five years,"" Vindman said. Vindman said he told Johnson that Trump was ""not necessarily supportive of such a forward-leaning approach."" ""This was a very awkward position to be in because I had to point this out to the senator,"" Vindman said. ""That I also don't agree with the policy. But I have to carry the water of the president. The president was already kind of testing the waters on withholding security assistance."" Vindman added: ""I wanted him (Johnson) to understand that while he might feel strongly about this and that it's the right thing to do, the chief executive might not be on board."" ""He gave me this quizzical look, like I was a crazy person, like I was the one that was out of step,"" Vindman said. Johnson's office said in a statement that Vindman's ""assertions are completely false,"" and pointed to a Nov. 2019 letter Johnson wrote House Republicans. In that letter, he recalled a conversation he had with Vindman in Ukraine. ""I had just finished making the point that supporting Ukraine was essential because it was ground zero in our geopolitical competition with Russia,"" Johnson wrote. ""I was surprised when Vindman responded to my point. He stated that it was the position of the NSC (National Security Council) that our relationship with Ukraine should be kept separate from our geopolitical competition with Russia. ""My blunt response was, 'How in the world is that even possible?' "" Johnson wrote he didn't know if ""Vindman accurately stated the NSC's position, whether President Trump shared that viewpoint, or whether Vindman was really expressing his own view."" Johnson wrote he believed ""that a significant number of bureaucrats and staff members within the executive branch have never accepted President Trump as legitimate and resent his unorthodox style and his intrusion onto their 'turf.' They react by leaking to the press and participating in the ongoing effort to sabotage his policies and, if possible, remove him from office. It is entirely possible that Vindman fits this profile."" Vindman charged Johnson wrote the letter to undermine his credibility before he gave testimony in the impeachment. He said Johnson ""scurried back to his comfort zone, which is how a political creature, a political animal that saw his political survival in pandering to Donald Trump.""

3/8/2022,"As I queued at a cash machine with another dozen disorientated Russians in Tbilisi, Georgia, a local man stopped, whistled at us, and shouted: “Russian warship, go f— yourself! Russians, go f— yourselves!” We immediately recognised the warship quote, first spoken by a group of Ukrainian border guards as they refused to surrender an island on the first day of the Russian invasion. It has since become a rallying cry against Moscow. Since the invasion started almost two weeks ago, more than 1.5 million Ukrainians have fled to central Europe and further afield in a desperate escape from Russian bombs. But tens of thousands of Russians - most of them well-educated, urban and with an international outlook - have now fled Vladimir Putin’s regime and what appears to be an imminent new Iron Curtain. Armenia’s Yerevan, Uzbekistan’s Bukhara or Turkey’s Istanbul – the destination is not important. While some locals are less than welcoming to the new arrivals, many Russians - myself included - felt we had no choice. An avalanche of international sanctions threaten to plunge millions into poverty and make Russia an international pariah on a par with North Korea. A draconian new law that means anyone who contradicts the official Kremlin line on the conflict can face 15 years in jail has led to an exodus of journalists. Persistent rumours about the impending introduction of martial law, which could lead to enforced conscription, has made escape even more pressing for men of fighting age. Within days from the start of the conflict, all the plane tickets out of the country had been snapped up as the West moved to close its airspace to Russian airlines. Some Russians made the journey across the border into Europe on foot. I was lucky and managed to fly to Tbilisi, with an overnight stopover in Istanbul. In Turkey, I went to meet a local friend at a bar in a 19th-century palazzo, where I immediately bumped into two Moscow acquaintances. They work, or used to work, at two of Moscow’s best-known cultural institutions. The glitzy headquarters of both organisations still stand in Moscow, but all of their operations have been suspended. Russia has become too toxic to play any role in international culture. Both of my friends, Western-educated men aged in their 30s, spoke of paralysing fear when clearing passport control in Moscow. A number of travellers have been questioned by border guards and asked to unlock their phones. Both men had deleted their chats and any applications that might have marked them out as opposition-minded. One of them installed an app for the Kremlin outlet RT as a decoy. “Anything you say is a treason in Russia right now,” one of the men said. The Russia we knew no longer exists. Vladimir Putin’s war-era Russia has no time for designers, artists and IT developers - or anyone else with a global outlook. The talk on the streets of Istanbul and Tbilisi is all about where to go, where to settle. The influx of educated Russians desperate to escape has drawn comparison to the exodus of White Russian emigres who fled from Bolsheviks after Russia’s Civil War, more than a century ago. The White Russians - named after the anti-Bolshevik White Army and counting Vladimir Nabokov, the novelist, and Igor Stravinsky, the composer, among their members - settled across the globe, leaving behind lasting cultural heritage. As we sat in that Istanbul club, talking about the ins and outs of getting a residence permit in Turkey, a tall man in a baseball cap and swanky glasses walked into the room. It was Kirill Serebrennikov, Russia’s most sought-after film and theatre director. The new emigres that I met in Istanbul and Tbilisi were overwhelmingly in their 30s and 40s, with transferable skills, whether these be in technology or film. At least 25,000 Russians travelled to Georgia last week alone, Levan Davitashvili, a Georgian deputy prime minister, said on Monday. His country was open to this new skilled labour, he said. Tbilisi’s hotels and guest houses are fully booked this week and Russian speakers outnumber locals at many cafes and shops. As I went down for breakfast at my hotel in Tbilisi on Sunday morning, I saw a room full of Russians - young, polite couples with their dogs and children, all looking confused and sad. One floor up, you could hear a woman crying out at the top of her voice, cursing Putin for destroying her life. At the weekend, Visa and MasterCard announced they were suspending operations for Russia. But in a cruel twist, it turned out that the ban will only affect those using Russian-issued cards outside the country. The 72 per cent of Russians who never travel abroad - incidentally, roughly the same proportion of Russians that support Putin - will not be affected. Those who have fled or want to visit the West will be punished. In the queue where we were told to “go f—” ourselves in Tbilisi, we were desperately trying to withdraw dollars before our bank cards turned into useless pieces of plastic. On Monday, they did - turning successful professionals into paupers overnight, although I hope only temporarily. I, for one, had to face the wrath of a taxi driver who could not get his ride fare from my Russian account, because it had been blocked as I was in his car. My countrymen in Georgia whispered to each other about a major bank that was asking new Russian clients to sign a form stating that they opposed the Kremlin’s aggression in Ukraine, as well as Moscow’s occupation of Georgia’s breakaway republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. A central branch of that bank was besieged by anxious Russian men and women filling in the forms as soon as it opened on Monday morning.",World/The Telegraph,Russia’s impending doom of censorship and sanctions meant I had no choice but to flee,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-impending-doom-censorship-sanctions-170210343.html
