12/23/2021,"The police watchdog will not investigate a complaint that officers failed to properly look into an alleged party at Downing Street during lockdown in December last year, it has said. Jenny Jones, a Green party peer, asked the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) to investigate after reports that a gathering took place on 18 December 2020 that involved food, party games and drinking late into the night.  In a letter to the IOPC this month, Jones said officers were on duty at Downing Street to protect the building and that part of their job involved controlling access. “If there was an unlawful gathering taking place at No 10 Downing Street, then the police must have known, and were highly likely to have played an active part in organising or facilitating the illegal gathering,” she wrote. Complaints first have to be considered by the relevant force, and the IOPC initially referred it to the Metropolitan police. The Met referred it back, and on Tuesday Jones posted a message on Twitter saying it was now being considered. On Wednesday the IOPC said that, having assessed the referral, it had returned it to the Metropolitan police. An IOPC spokesperson told PA Media: “We can confirm that on 17 December we received a referral from the Metropolitan police service [MPS] of a complaint about an alleged party at Downing Street in December 2020. “Having fully assessed the referral we have decided it is invalid and we have returned it to the MPS to handle as it determines would be appropriate. “Under the relevant legislation, a valid complaint can only be made where an individual, or someone acting on their behalf, has been adversely affected by the alleged conduct or its effects. “There was nothing within the referral to indicate the complainant was physically present or nearby when officers stationed at Downing Street allegedly failed to enforce Covid rules. Nor is there a suggestion that they were physically present or sufficiently nearby when the effects of the officers’ actions occurred.” A separate complaint by Jones, that the Met Commissioner, Cressida Dick, refused to investigate the allegations, has been referred to the Mayor’s Office for Policing And Crime (Mopac), which sets the direction and budget for the force. Mopac has said it is assessing the complaint to decide if further action is required. The event is also among those being investigated by the senior civil servant Sue Gray.",News/World news,Police watchdog dismisses complaint against No 10 officers over alleged party,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/police-watchdog-dismisses-complaint-against-no-10-officers-over-alleged-party
12/23/2021,"And so it is Merry Christmas ... Like many people, politicians have been sending cards to support their favourite charities. Only MPs’ favourite charities invariably turn out to be themselves, as their cards are carefully chosen to convey a subtext that portrays them in the best possible light. So here are what their messages really mean.  Normally prime ministers like to send cards of themselves surrounded by adoring members of their family. Unfortunately Boris is unable to remember quite how many children he actually now has and the families he can name will only get together in a courtroom. A photo of Boris and Carrie on their own was rejected because the only pictures they could find were of the pair of them lying face down after yet another party while everyone around them is singing “Stand up if you hate Boris”. So in the end, the Johnsons ended up with a photo of Dilyn running through the Downing Street garden trying to avoid the empties, on the grounds that the dog was the only family member everyone liked. The Labour leader doesn’t appear to have made a new card. So we can only assume he’s gone green and is recycling last year’s in which he and his wife, Victoria, were pictured outside a redbrick house that may even have been his own. In 2020 both were clapping the NHS. Now Keir is clapping himself. After two years lagging behind the Tories in the polls, Starmer’s smile now looks genuine. He has finally assembled a shadow cabinet that looks both credible and electable and his ratings are above Johnson’s. ‘Tis the season to be jolly. The Lib Dem leader also toyed with a card of himself and his family. Up until the point where the party focus grouped the final three photos and nobody had a clue who Ed was. The best guess was ‘that supporting actor from the Hatton Garden heist’ film. So instead, Davey organised a competition for schoolkids, with the winning entry a drawing of three elves serving at a soup kitchen. Unfortunately, no one has yet turned up for a free meal. A rather more subtle form of branding for the Scottish first minister. As well as Bute House, her official residence, the design also includes the Finnieston crane and SEC Armadillo venue in Glasgow, and the Scottish parliament building in Edinburgh, along with thistles and a Charles Rennie Mackintosh-style rose. The message is clear. Scotland is all hers and Westminster can do one. Another independence referendum is only a matter of time. Oh dear. Oh very dear. The foreign secretary just can’t conceal her ambitions and seems to have no idea that everyone in the country – as well as in Westminster – is laughing at her ridiculous vanity. From her card, it is evident she is not just eyeing up Boris Johnson’s job but also the Queen’s. Sitting on her throne, surrounded by a union flag and an imperial globe, one-third of which is sure to be painted red, the co-author of Britannia Unchained – the definitive go-to 2012 book for rightwing Tories who believe the problem with the UK is that its workers are innately lazy – is now positioning herself as a latter day Britannia. The empress in waiting. I, for one, can’t wait. She will be a disaster for the country – her synapses only intermittently connect – but a gift for sketch writers. Much more sophisticated, yet still very much on brand for the other Tory leadership rival is the chancellor’s card showing his white-socked feet in a pair of sliders with “Merry” on the right foot and “Xmas” on the left. Plus a few baubles and a bit of tinsel. Here is a politician who knows how to laugh at himself while taking the piss out of the entire country. Look on the back of the card and there’s a link to his upmarket, luxury goods website – www.dishirishi.com – where you can buy the self-same sliders. A snip at $299.99. VAT deductible for residents of the Cayman Islands. One for the connoisseurs. At first glance this drawing by a child from his Bromsgrove constituency looks like a Santa hat with radioactive eyes. But look closer and you will see it is the first artist’s impression of the Omicron variant. This is a card that says The Saj is on your side, is committed to slaying the mutant beast and can laugh in the face of adversity. Her original card featuring the baby Jesus in a capsized rubber dinghy being pushed back to France by a Border Force patrol is the subject of a dispute in the European court of human rights. In its place and in actual reality, the home secretary has chosen a reindeer drawn by a schoolchild in her constituency. Patel said: “The judges were impressed by the strong message that Christmas is the ideal time of year to take back control. The reindeer clearly represents Santa’s homeland, where we are currently building the world’s largest detention centre to house illegal migrants, such as the so-called ‘three wise men’ who are clearly just trying to get to the UK to scrounge benefits.” Sadly, due to so many postmen and women being off sick with Covid, some cards seem to have gone awol. So instead I will suggest the cards I would like them to have sent: a naked Dominic Raab doing press-ups , the grainy CCTV image of Matt Hancock snogging Gina Colangelo with the title “Forget the Grinch, Feel the Clinch” and a Grant Shapps card of him standing next to Michael Green and Sebastian Fox, signed “With best wishes from the three of us”.

12/23/2021,"Good morning. Welcome to the final morning mail for 2021. No need to fret though, over the festive break we’ll bring you Five Great Reads, where Guardian Australia’s lifestyle editor, Alyx Gorman, will do the heavy lifting for you and find five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads. Sign up here and receive it in your inbox from Monday to Friday. Here are today’s top stories. A proposal by the NSW government that hospitals charge unvaccinated patients for their medical care has been condemned as “unethical” by the nation’s peak doctors body. The state health minister, Brad Hazzard, told media it was an option “under consideration by the NSW government” but did not elaborate on how the proposal would be enacted. Opening hours at Covid-19 testing clinics will be heavily reduced during the Christmas period, despite “unprecedented demand” and hours-long wait times in multiple states. In NSW, three out of four of the state’s 490 testing sites will be partially closed for Christmas and New Year’s Day, with Scott Morrison and Victoria’s Covid-19 commander, Jeroen Weimar, criticising interstate travel testing requirements.  Russia has claimed the US will hold talks early next year to consider its “security guarantees”, including a ban on Ukraine joining Nato. The Kremlin’s positioning of tanks and artillery along the Russia-Ukraine border has dramatically escalated tensions but the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, remains adamant a diplomatic solution will be reached. A White House spokesperson said any dialogue “must be based on reciprocity”. Russia has denied using gas as a negotiating chip after it redirected supplies away from Europe and towards Russia for a second day running, despite record demand in the west during the height of midwinter. Data from South Africa appears to add weight to claims the Omicron variant is less severe than previous strains but scientists have cautioned against extrapolating the findings globally. Countries such as Italy, that were notably struck during the first wave, have a median population age nearly 20 years higher than South Africa, suggesting it could yet disproportionately experience the virus. The World Health Organization has warned that booster drives in western countries could prolong the pandemic if they come at the cost of ensuring that the entire global adult population has sufficient access to vaccine supply. The federal government will pay a traditional owners corporation more than $2m after settling a class action over a “work for the dole” program described as “modern-day slavery”. After a year of confidential mediation, a federal court judge approved the settlement, awarded to 10 of the nation’s poorest communities. A sexual abuse victim in Tasmania has received a record payout of more than $5m in damages, with the state’s supreme court saying the figure recognises “the lifelong impact of child sexual abuse”. A memorial to the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre appears set to be removed from Hong Kong’s oldest university, with security guards blocking media access to the sectioned-off area where the sculpture stands. The EU claims to have taken a step closer to agreeing a 15% minimum corporate tax rate for multinational companies, despite Joe Biden facing challenges enacting the agreement. Israeli archaeologists have unearthed a sunken treasure trove containing hundreds of Roman and medieval coins near the ancient city of Caesarea, including “exceptional” items of jewellery and gemstones. It’s the second-largest city in NSW but, after a Covid-19 outbreak, local business owners are describing Newcastle as “a ghost town”. “It’s like the apocalypse out there,” publican Luke Tilse tells Michael McGowan. “I feel like I’m running the last waterhole, and everyone’s coming here to drink the muddy water.” After more than 200 people contracted the coronavirus at a 1970s-themed nightclub event, the Hunter region is now home to more than 5,000 active cases: prompting the cancellation of football games, music festivals and a spate of restaurant and hotel closures. A traditional Australian Christmas spread can be a daunting prospect if you’re vegan. But not eating meat shouldn’t mean the end to tasty and sumptuous festive fare – with a little imagination, you can conjure up “beet Wellington” or “faux gras” that rises to the occasion but caters for every palate, as the Vegan Butcher, Zacchary Bird, shows with these five recipes. Organising Christmas can be stressful at the best of times, but what to do when a family member tries to one-up you? That’s the dilemma posed to advice columnist Eleanor Gordon-Smith: “If you feel insulted by what this aunt did, I’ll bet it’s not just because of the particulars of this invite. I’ll bet there’s a long backdrop of past behaviour and infinitesimally small gestures and inflections between you that serve as a kind of meaning decoder.” Guardian Australia’s 10 funniest things on the internet series was launched as a short-term lockdown distraction. But while Covid-19 has long overstayed its welcome, it seems the appetite for some fun during these trying times remains insatiable. And now we want to know – what are your favourite online funnies from 2021? This week our staff get the ball rolling with theirs. The best and worst of 2021: the internet.

Now an 18-month Covid-related seachange has afforded the scribe the chance to try his hand at competitive sport as he dips his toes into the world of surfing. “Some sports are bigger than the Olympics.” But, as Beau Dure writes, ice hockey “is not one of those sports”. And the decision by the NHL and its players’ union to pull their participation at the Beijing Olympics due to Covid concerns could have inadvertently hastened the sport’s global decline. Victoria could move today to expand its indoor mask mandate, the Age reports, with James Merlino set to outline any changes in coming hours. An elite Perth high school is under investigation by police after intimate images of a teenage girl, aged under 15, were shared via social media among students, the West Australian writes. And Peter Dutton has accused China of looking to militarise space, according to the Australian, claiming that Beijing is developing satellites that can attack other satellites. The first funeral of a child who died in the Tasmanian jumping castle tragedy will take place in Devonport. Former Test cricket star Michael Slater will appear in court in relation to reportedly breaching an apprehended violence order. The Big Apple is notorious for its crushing real estate market but a viral TikTok video tour of “the smallest apartment in New York” has laid bare just how tough things are, in a clip that bears the tagline: “Whatever your expectations are, lower them.”Although the price is not listed, this “charming micro-apartment” could probably be yours for a cool $1,600 a month.

12/23/2021,"In the wake of the third New Caledonian referendum on independence from France, French president Emmanuel Macron declared that “France is more beautiful because New Caledonia decided to stay.” The vote in the 12 December referendum – supposedly the finale of a 30-year process of preparation and consultation – was an overwhelming 96.5% against independence.  Macron’s centre-right Republican rival, Valérie Pécresse, has hailed the vote a “massive choice” to stay, while the emerging far-right candidate Eric Zemmour said the decision was final. But New Caledonia’s future as a French territory is anything but settled and a return to the violence that wracked New Caledonia a possibility. Only one side turned up to vote, and the result was entirely predictable. Only 43.9% of eligible voters cast their ballot as against nearly 86% in the previous referendum. The abstainers were mostly indigenous Kanaks, who have been agitating since the 1980s to follow their fellow Melanesians in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu into independent statehood. Until recent months, the Kanaks were willing participants in the consultation process, then the Delta variant of Covid-19 arrived in early September, quickly infecting over 12,000 people and causing 280 deaths, about 60% among Kanaks, and other Pacific islanders. Many Kanak communities were plunged into traditional mourning rituals that can take up to a year. In addition, a lockdown restricted campaigns by Kanak parties, which typically rely on villages meetings and tours by leaders. The Kanak parties appealed to Macron to postpone the referendum but he refused. A last-minute court appeal for delay also failed. So the Kanak coalition called a boycott of the referendum. “This isn’t over, and people who are saying it’s over are misreading the strength of the boycott,” says Nic Maclellan, a veteran commentator on Pacific affairs in Australia. Not only did nearly all Kanaks heed their parties’ call for “non-participation” they did so peacefully. Paris had sent 2,000 extra gendarmes and 30 armoured cars to maintain security – they were not needed. A key question now is whether electoral rolls in any future referendum or local government elections will be thrown open to more recent arrivals to New Caledonia. Until now, only Kanaks and long-established settlers have been allowed to vote. To open the vote to all the residents of New Caledonia would be “recolonisation” and definitively end the Kanak dream of independence, said Mathias Chauchat, professor of public law at the University of New Caledonia in Noumea. “In essence, opening the electoral roll would give power to the whites. It would revert to the colony like before, with the French in power and the Kanaks like an aboriginal minority. They would be left with their customs on the margin, all the while saying that their identity was recognised. It would be a system of apartheid that doesn’t say its name.” “The situation is explosive because the Kanaks would never accept this recolonisation,” Chauchat added. “We are on a powder-keg. It needs only a spark for it to explode.” For their part, the seven pro-independence parties based among the Kanaks said dialogue had been broken by the “stubbornness” of the French government, which had been “unable to reconcile its geo-strategic interests in the Pacific with its obligation to decolonise New Caledonia.”. New Caledonia’s regional neighbours have dismissed the referendum result. The Melanesian Spearhead Group – representing Papua New Guinea, the Solomons, Vanuatu and Fiji – issued a statement proclaiming the results “null and void due to the ‘non-participation’ of the indigenous people of Kanaky.” The Pacific Islands Forum – a wider regional grouping – noted the boycott and said that “civic participation was an integral component of any democracy and critical to the interpretation and implications of Sunday’s poll.” While some strategists worry about France walking out, leaving a destitute mini-state open to Chinese influence, it is worth considering exactly what kind of independence is being proposed by the Kanaks. Chauchat said the Union Calédonienne, one of the main Kanak parties, has been considering the “free association” link of the Cook Islands to New Zealand, whereby Wellington looks after the islands’ defence and foreign policy in consultation with the Cook Islands government. The small nation has membership of many international agencies, though not a UN seat. Adrian Muckle, a historian at the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, said another Kanak party, UNI-Palika, had also evoked in its manifesto the idea of a partnership or association with France. “They have sought to discuss in advance of the final referendum what that might look like in more detail, but Paris and ‘loyalists’ have actively refused to engage, suggesting that such discussions could only take place after a vote for independence and that nothing can be discussed until then,” Muckle said. “Their concern, I think, is that any fleshed-out ideas on independence-in-association might make a ‘yes’ vote more attractive.” Since the vote, Sébastien Lecornu, France’s minister for overseas territories, has called for submissions on a permanent status for New Caledonia within France, to be finalised within 18 months. The Kanak parties have said they will wait until after next year’s French elections before resuming dialogue with Paris. They would have little traction until then anyway. With Macron now fighting for re-election from the centre against the right and far-right, electoral considerations will not allow much flexibility in thinking about New Caledonia’s future.

12/23/2021,"You can sense the sudden political alarm in Westminster. What, if anything, can be done to cushion the blow of higher energy bills that will hit consumers next April? It seemed until recently that ministers’ plan A was to pray that wholesale gas prices in Europe would fall after their surge in the early autumn, thereby limiting the increase in average annual household domestic energy bills to £250 or so. There is not even a remote chance of such a gentle outcome now. Gas prices have been setting new highs this week, coupled with mentions of the word “unprecedented”. The current wholesale price of 400p-ish a therm compares to 60p-ish at the start of the year.  Five months of the latest six-month “observation window” for calculating the level of the next price cap have passed, meaning everybody can make a reasonable estimate of what the backward-looking formula will spit out in February. Energy consultancy Cornwall Insight says £1,865 per annum, versus £1,277 currently. Analysts at bank Investec think the figure will be closer to £2,000. Call it an average annual increase of about 50%, if the price-cap formula is applied mechanically. And, critically, future gas prices suggest no relief in sight. Russian and German wrangling over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, French nuclear shutdowns and higher demand for gas as backup to renewables are not factors that will disappear overnight. Stop thinking about a price “spike”, cautions Investec, and consider “a high likelihood of both prolonged and even higher gas prices through winter with an impact that stretches out over the next two years”. Cornwall’s early estimate of the next-but-one adjustment to the price cap in October 2022 produces a figure of £2,240 per annum. Thus the belated scramble in government to explore a few fiddles to bills. Annual charges covering renewables incentives, one of the minor components, could be deferred. So, too, network charges, a bigger element. A similar smoothing process could be applied to the looming £2.5bn cost of absorbing the failure of 26 energy suppliers since August. Add it all up, though, and Investec reckons such “mitigations” only amount to £300. Sky-high gas prices dominate everything. And it would be bold to try to use all the deferral fudges in one go; the policy equivalent of maxing out on the credit card. Only waiving VAT, payable at 5% by households, looks straightforward. Current Westminster thinking seems to be edging towards bigger interventions to shield low-income households from the full blast. The winter warm homes discount scheme could be turned into an all-year affair. But again, unless the cost can be buried in general taxation and borrowing, it would mean other bill-payers picking up the difference and paying even more for their energy. That, in turn, raises deep questions of fair redistribution and who would qualify for a discount. There is no precedent to fall back upon. The numbers at stake are colossal. If nothing changes, the additional annual energy bill for households will come to £18bn – or 1.3% of total consumer spending – on Investec’s numbers, and an overnight switch to average bills of £2,000 would add 1.8 percentage points to headline inflation in April 2022. Covid aside, there will be few bigger running political headaches in early 2022. Doing nothing – in other words, letting the price increases rip under the standard formula – does not look politically feasible. But that’s as far as the thinking seems to have progressed. Ministers have about a month, that’s all, to find a strategy. The plan is to “reimagine retail”, says property giant Landsec, about half a decade into its confrontation with the growth of online shopping. It’s certainly having to reimagine what its shopping centres (thankfully not the largest part of its portfolio) are worth. In a doubling-down transaction, Landsec is buying a 25% stake in the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent for £172m, adding to the one-third holding it already has. The interesting bit is how Bluewater has fallen in value over the years: the decline is about two-thirds since 2014, when Landsec first bought in. That’s an enormous movement for a shopping centre that, even now, is almost the definition of prime retail estate. Landsec is punting, in effect, that the bottom has been reached. The thesis is reasonable since there is early evidence that rents in retail “destinations” are finally starting to stabilise. You have to wonder, though, what the group was thinking in 2014. Its acquisition timing back then was horrible.",News/Business,Rising UK energy bills are a political headache with no cure | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/dec/22/rising-energy-bills-are-a-political-headache-with-no-cure-on-the-horizon--nils-pratley
