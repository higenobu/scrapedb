3/25/2022,"Rishi Sunak has sought to defend his mini-budget against accusations he failed to shield Britain’s poorest families from the worst hit to living standards in six decades, as economists warned 1.3 million people will fall into absolute poverty next year. Amid heavy criticism of Wednesday’s spring statement from opposition leaders and his own back benches, experts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and Resolution Foundation thinktanks said the chancellor could have done more to help those most at need. With those on the lowest incomes bearing the brunt of Britain’s cost of living crisis, the Resolution Foundation said absolute poverty was now on course to hit almost a fifth of the population. It said half a million more children were expected to fall below the breadline this financial year, bringing the total to 12.5 million across the UK, up from 11.2 million. The rise in absolute poverty – where households have less than 60% of the average income – would be the first time such an increase has been recorded in Britain outside of a recession, demonstrating the scale of the shock to family budgets as the war in Ukraine adds to a pandemic-induced surge in living costs. In a round of spiky media interviews on Thursday, Sunak defended his plans by saying he could not solve “every problem” and insisted that measures such as a 5p cut to fuel duty, a rise in the national insurance threshold and the promise of an income tax cut in two years’ time would “make a difference”. He said official forecasts for the biggest hit to living standards since the mid-1950s needed to be taken in context as Britain emerges from the “biggest economic shock in over 300 years” inflicted by the Covid pandemic. After facing criticism for announcing no further support for those on universal credit, who will see their benefits rise by just 3% while inflation leaps to nearly 8%, Sunak retorted during a BBC interview: “We can’t do everything.” However, leading economists said rhetoric deployed by the chancellor in his spring statement update to the house of Commons on Wednesday had failed to match up to reality. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, said Sunak had “proved to be something of a fiscal illusionist” by announcing tax cuts and other measures that would only go a limited way to offsetting previously announced plans. Raising national insurance by 1.25 percentage points from April while announcing cuts in income tax for the future “looks indefensible from an economic point of view, though one can see the political attractions”, Johnson said. “He continues, despite his rhetoric, to be a chancellor presiding over a very big increase in the tax burden. What he did yesterday was not enough even to stop the expected tax burden rising yet further.” Last autumn the government removed a £20 per week uplift in universal credit put in place during the pandemic, in a move charities warned would drive up poverty long before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine added to the highest rates of inflation for three decades. Despite growing pressure on families, the IFS said the cut meant the value of universal credit for a single out-of-work homeowner with two children had fallen by almost a fifth in the space of six months, and was worth almost 9% less than before the pandemic after taking account of inflation. On a day of heavy criticism from all quarters for the government over its handling of the cost of living crisis, Boris Johnson himself appeared to concede that the measures might not go far enough. “As we go forward, we need to do more,” he told the LBC radio station before taking part in a Nato summit in Brussels. The prime minister suggested further steps would be taken to help families with the government’s imminent energy security plan, and dropped a heavy hint that more support could be provided ahead of a further expected increase in energy prices this autumn. “Don’t forget that I think that the cost of living is the single biggest thing we’re having to fix, and we will fix it,” he said. Johnson’s official spokesperson later insisted that “the prime minister fully supports everything the chancellor set out yesterday”. With national insurance contributions due to rise by 1.25 percentage points next month and income tax thresholds frozen for four years, only one in eight workers will see actually see their tax fall by the end of the parliament, according to the Resolution Foundation. Labour said Sunak was driving up the tax burden to the highest level in 70 years, while doing little to help the poorest in society. Pat McFadden, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “He has chosen to press ahead with tax rises now to suit the Tory party election grid. “That decision will have a direct effect in making the cost of living crisis worse for households in the coming year.” Although tax cuts promised for the future could have placated backbench Tories uncomfortable with the chancellor’s plans, several dismissed his spring statement for doing too little to ease the burden on families. While many Conservatives welcomed the plans, Lee Anderson, Tory MP for the “red wall” constituency of Ashfield, said cutting 5p fuel duty was a “drop in the ocean” given that it only lowered petrol prices to the level they stood at a week earlier. “I would have liked it to have been much more,” he said. Peter Bone, the veteran eurosceptic Conservative MP, said Office for Budget Responsibility figures showing the chancellor had about £32bn of headroom within self-imposed borrowing targets suggested he could have gone further. “We said in the manifesto we weren’t going to raise taxes,” Bone told the Guardian. “He didn’t have to. And advertising the penny drop in income tax when we can’t possibly know what the situation is going to be in 2024 I was less than amused by.” Peter Aldous, another backbencher, said he was disappointed that universal credit claimants would see their benefits rise by 3% – less than half what inflation is predicted to grow by. “With the economy in a state of near full employment, we must recognise the prevailing attitude that more work is always the answer cannot spare everyone the potential destitution some now face.” With soaring living costs, the Resolution Foundation estimates a typical family will face a £1,100 loss of income this year, with poorer households bearing the brunt of the cost of living squeeze. It said that over the five-year period from Boris Johnson’s election in 2019 – on a mandate to level up Britain’s economy after a decade of austerity – household incomes were now on track for the biggest fall of any parliament on record. “The big picture is that Rishi Sunak has prioritised rebuilding his tax-cutting credentials over supporting the low- to middle-income households who will be hardest hit from the surging cost of living, while also leaving himself fiscal flexibility in the years ahead,” said Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. “Whether that will be sustainable in the face of huge income falls to come remains to be seen.”",News/Politics,"Sunak could have done more to help poorest families, say thinktanks",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/24/sunak-could-have-done-more-to-help-poorest-families-say-thinktanks
3/25/2022,"Sitting in the front room of his house in south London, surrounded by his wife, daughter and four excited dogs, Anoosheh Ashoori admits that at night he reaches out to touch his wife’s hand to reassure himself that she is really there. In Evin prison in Tehran, over the previous four years one of his worst nightmares was to dream about her, and wake up in his “coffin ”– as beds were called by inmates in Evin – to realise she was not by his side and might never be again. Sentenced to 10 years for spying in 2017, the 68-year-old British-Iranian was released last week along with Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. During his five-year incarceration “hope was the only emotion that kept me alive and from insanity”, he says. In his first newspaper interview since his release he criticises UK ministers singling out Boris Johnson’s “blunder”, and wondering if British ministers had spent just one day in Evin they would have acted earlier to pay the £400m debt that led to his and Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release. Ashoori travelled to Iran in August 2017 to see his mother who had just had a knee operation. “One morning after about 10 days I went to the market to have the zip of my suitcase fixed and, as I walked down to the bottom of the hill, a car pulled over. Four people got out of the car and asked me whether I was Mr Ashoori. I said ‘yes’, and one of them took my suitcase, and they pushed me in the backseat. Two guys sat in the back and two in the front. “As we entered the motorway towards the east of Tehran, one of them handed over a piece of paper. It was headed anti-espionage department. It was a warrant for my arrest. They handed me a blindfold and told me to put it over my head, and then they ordered me to rest my head on one of the men’s lap, so it was disorientating, and then the noise died down, and we reached a building. “I did not know what was going on. I was completely perplexed. And then it is almost like having a heart attack. What have I got to do with spying? What have I got to do with any of this? “They started interrogating me, and saying if I did not cooperate they would take me to Evin jail. Then they took me back to my house and they took the laptop, my phone and hard drive. Then they took me to a prison and strip-searched me. “I was then taken to a cell for two days and left alone. All I could hear was shouting. The suspense is terrifying. It starts hitting you. And then my interrogation started, sometimes 10-hour sessions. “They would say: ‘Talk,’ and I would reply: ‘What should I talk about?’ Anything. And then they tried to make me write my guilt down, and ironically the paper they gave me said at the top ‘your salvation is in your honesty’. So if you tell the truth you will be acquitted. “But during the past 68 years you cannot find a shred of evidence that I was politically active. “They would show me pictures of [his wife] Sherry, and multiple pictures of my daughter and said you will never see them again. I told the interrogator: ‘You cannot reach them. They are in Britain’, and he replied: ‘Do you remember Shapour Bakhtiar, the former prime minister killed in Paris. We can reach anybody’.” His desperate situation seemed to trigger suicidal thoughts. “I remembered pictures from Auschwitz that people had died from starvation. So I quietly decided not to eat.” He pretended to eat his food but in reality flushed it down the toilet. The guards intervened after 17 days when they realised he was rapidly losing weight. “I started crying because I thought with another month I would achieve my mission and die.” His interrogators put him in cell with three other people for the first time. Eventually he was put into room 121 – six metres (19.7ft) by eight metres – with 17 other people. It was here for the first time he was allowed to speak with his wife. “But she had an operation on her thyroid and I could not recognise her voice. I thought it was an impostor and told her to give a sign that it was her, so she gave her nickname. Only she and I knew it.” All the time there was his interrogations. Even now he says he cannot understand what his interrogators were doing since they knew he was not a spy, but just trying to break him into giving a confession. “The interrogator would say: ‘If you don’t cooperate we can extend this stay in here for years and years. You will see spring come, summers come and autumns come,’ and then you start to form a bond with your interrogators. It’s amazing you become happy to see him.” When they felt they had extracted all they could, his inquisitors wrote a report to the main interrogator. “When we met, I was crying so hard and he was smiling, saying he was indifferent. He said: ‘I do not have any compassion whether you are an infant or a 99-year-old woman’. The guard I saw was crying too”. Once his interrogation with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was over, he was taken to a larger dormitory, hall 12, containing other dual nationals charged with spying. “Many of the people were highly educated. They formed poetry societies, a short-story writing society, a macro-economics society. There was a diplomat that taught Spanish and a doctor with a PhD in physics. I wrote a 3,000 page diary.” He also built a shelter in a little patio outside hall 12. It became known as Ashoori’s corner. “I had my tea or coffee and people would come to sit with me and chat. I gained a reputation for being discreet, and people would come and confide, and empty their hearts.” The shelter was heated by putting cotton strands from a mop into the lid of an empty bottle of cough mixture, filling the lid with smuggled alcohol disinfectant, and then using the strands as a wick. “Alongside I grew some morning glories, some white, and some pinkish. I dried 100 of them. I thought to myself, if I am ever released I will give one to every person that helped me recover my freedom.” There is a pile of them on the table in the front room, along with his marquetry, including his picture of the Mona Lisa, and portraits of David Attenborough and Charles Darwin. “It was how I fought insanity and rage.” It was in the larger hall with his fellow inmates that he began to piece together why he had been arrested. “It was the first time, for instance, that I heard Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s name.” But the sense of injustice and loss began to tell. “Anytime I rang Sherry I had difficulty talking to her. I had a lump in my throat. I knew that if I talked I would burst into tears. You cannot put the pain into words. It’s impossible to explain what it is like to be stung like a bee, unless you have.” It was only after two years when he was finally sentenced to 10 years, and his case publicised by the Iranians, that he and wife decided to follow Richard Ratcliffe and campaign in public. “For two years the Foreign Office advice was to keep away from publicity. If we had not listened, maybe we would have got a better result earlier. I really admire Richard Ratcliffe, and if it was not for his joint effort with Sherry we would still be rotting in there.” He makes a distinction between UK Foreign Office officials, for whom he has the highest praise, in particular the negotiator Stephanie Al-Qaq and the British ambassador Simon Shercliff, and ministers. “Why that blunder by Boris Johnson that ended up with Nazanin staying a number of years when she could have been released? You expect leaders to make the right decisions on time. You expect someone to lead his nation – to do his job correctly. Why did they not acknowledge us as hostages? I asked them: why won’t you refer to us as hostages? I never had an answer. “It is hard that the same time when you are in Evin and you know your presence is related to this debt the UK government owes. Is it such a big job to pay this debt? Would those ministers be able to stand even one day of their life in Evin? If they could feel what it is like maybe they would have made the right decision much earlier. You cannot imagine yourself in that hell, that cesspool. “My birthday is on 8 April but I will not celebrate it. I cannot celebrate it until everyone is out. I sat in the VIP lounge at Tehran airport and I saw Nazanin come in. Right up to the last moment I expected others. “I know I am not going to be the last person to end up in this hell that I have just left, so if I do something that takes us one small step away from tyranny then that will be worthwhile.”",News/World news,‘You cannot put the pain into words’: Anoosheh Ashoori on his detention in Iran,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/anoosheh-ashoori-detention-iran-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe
3/25/2022,"It normally takes at least a couple of days for a budget to unravel. But the chancellor’s spring statement had landed dead on arrival with not even the usually friendly voices of the rightwing media finding anything positive to say about it. Instead the headlines had been damning. The worst fall in the standard of living since records began. The highest level of taxation since the 1940s. More than a million people to fall into absolute poverty. Nothing for the out-of-work and disabled. Food and energy prices spiralling out of control. Worse still was the implication that Rishi Sunak was financially illiterate. The incompetent former Goldman Sachs banker who couldn’t make his sums add up. Hopelessly exposed as out of his depth. He had put up national insurance to pay for the NHS and was now reducing the take by raising the threshold. As if he had never intended to hypothecate the tax rise. Fancy that! Then there was the cut in fuel duty that no one would notice as forecourt prices were going so fast. He’d said he would raise them by 5p again in a year’s time, but everyone knew that was a lie. So how was he going to afford the cut long term? As for the opportunistic income tax cut before the next election … the less said the better. So it was a decidedly tetchy – sulky, even – Sunak who embarked on the morning media round. The chancellor loves a lap of honour when he can smile coyly and luxuriate in the “Dishy Rishi” applause for his generous cash bailouts. But when things all go tits up and it’s clear there is no real plan for protecting the economy then he’s as thin-skinned as any other politician with an eye on the top job. Things got off to a bad start when Sky accused his wife’s family of benefiting from a stake in a company with links to Russia – sanctioning the billionaire in his own home would be a hell of a statement of intent – and quickly turned to farce as he tried to explain that he was completely in touch with working people because he had to buy different breads for every member of his family. As you do. Or rather as your staff do. Sunak hasn’t been near a supermarket in years. By the time the chancellor made it on to Radio 4’s Today programme, he was near the end of his tether. He couldn’t understand why Sarah, a carer with two children, wasn’t more grateful for all that he had done for her. When it was explained to him that none of the spring statement measures helped Sarah at all, he lost it. “If I might just have an opportunity to answer the question, that would be marvellous,” he said, snarkily. It was like this. He had done his bit for the little people last November. So if they were still broke, it was entirely their fault. Tell them to turn off a light or something. And give him Sarah’s details so he could bung her £20 or so. That was pretty much all he had to say. He couldn’t help everyone. It wasn’t his fault if energy prices kept rising. So there just had to be a point at which the government let people starve and freeze. This was what any financially prudent chancellor would do. And while he was about it, he might as well help people move along the path to poverty by capping the rise in state benefits to well below inflation. As for what might happen next, he really didn’t have a clue. He was completely out of ideas. Martha Kearney was left speechless. As were we all. Still, Rishi could console himself he wasn’t the only person having a shit day. Over in Portcullis House, Peter Hebblethwaite, the chief executive of P&O Ferries, was up before the combined business and transport select committees. Darren Jones, the business committee chair, cut to the chase. Was the chief exec just really bad at his job or was he a shameless criminal? Hebblethwaite – who looked like a man you’d appoint to head up a Ponzi scheme – shifted uncomfortably in his chair before choosing to answer. It was tricky, he said. But he would try to tell the truth. Something that didn’t come naturally. Yes, he was seriously hopeless at his job. Really he should never have made it above junior management level. But also he was a shameless criminal. So when he had reached the conclusion that the only way to save his £325k a year job was for everyone else to lose theirs, he hadn’t hesitated to break the law by sacking everyone without consultation. And with any luck he’d get a performance-related bonus for having done so. It had been completely deliberate not to consult the unions, he said. Because it was inevitable that the unions would have kicked off and he didn’t want to stress out officials by forcing them into negotiations that would inevitably be pointless. And the presence of security guards on the ferries when the sackings were announced was entirely for the seafarers’ benefit. Some people needed to be handcuffed to help them find their way off the boat. Hebblethwaite also observed that he had done the mass sackings by a live Zoom call. Not a pre-recorded message. He seemed to think this was a very human touch. He was also at pains to point out how generous he was being by paying some of the new workers £5.50 an hour. The minimum wage under international maritime law was £5.15. And he couldn’t really explain why it had only been British seafarers who had been sacked, rather than the French and Dutch. Though at a guess it was because he reckoned the British government would be much less bothered. “I’m very sorry,” he said at the end. Though not enough to be arsed to do anything about it. He’d take his chances with the changes in UK labour laws brought in by Failing Grayling. Not forgetting the catatonic idiocy of the attorney general, Suella Braverman. And the chances of the PM having told the truth in prime minister’s questions about taking P&O to court were near enough zero. Hell, the Suspect could barely even dress himself, judging by the pictures coming out of the Nato meeting in Brussels. He looked a total car wreck. None of the other Nato leaders had wanted to go anywhere near him at the group photo. So yes, Hebblethwaite would do the same all over again in a heartbeat. What’s more he looked as if he thought he’d get away with it. Just an expression of ersatz remorse and he would be out of there.",News/Politics,Sulky Sunak is as thin-skinned as any other politician with eye on top job | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/24/sulky-sunak-thin-skinned-as-any-politician-eye-on-top-job
3/25/2022,"Good morning. Environmental activists are calling for an embargo on Russian fossil fuels. The war in Ukraine could trigger food riots. And some Australian school students will join a global day of climate action, accusing the federal government of not caring about their futures. Nato leaders are willing to send more powerful weapons to Ukraine after a plea from the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for tanks, rockets and air defence systems at the Brussels summit. The United States has also announced new sanctions on more than 400 Russians deemed to be part of the country’s elite – including more than half the members of parliament – as part of the campaign to increase the price Moscow pays for the invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian and Ukrainian environmental activists have made a joint call for a European embargo on Russian oil, gas and coal, as children and young people prepare to take part in the latest wave of climate crisis school strikes and protests around the world. The impacts of the war continue to reverberate globally. The head of the World Trade Organization has said rocketing global food prices as a result of the war in Ukraine could trigger riots from those going hungry in poor countries. Taiwan is considering extending compulsory military service for young citizens to a year, its defence minister has said, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reignites debates in Taiwan over the readiness of its defence force for a potential invasion by China. The Australian government publicly pledged to buy 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal from miner Whitehaven to donate to Ukraine before finalising the cost to the taxpayer – and failed to approach at least one other major coalminer to gauge their interest. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Sunday announced the federal government was buying coal from Whitehaven to donate to the Ukrainian government, to help provide energy security to the war-torn nation. The announcement was welcomed by Ukraine and trumpeted by the Coalition. The government pledged to pay the entire cost of supplying and transporting the coal. But the federal resources minister, Keith Pitt, said on Wednesday the cost of acquiring the coal and sending it to Ukraine was “still being finalised” three days after the government publicly committed to the purchase. North Korea has launched what is thought to be its largest intercontinental ballistic missile to date, in a dramatic return to long-range testing that marks the regime’s most serious provocation for years. South Korea’s military fired a missile barrage into the Sea of Japan in response to the ICBM launch – the first full-range test of Kim Jong-un’s most powerful missiles since 2017. The launch will lead to fears that the North has made significant progress in developing weapons capable of sending nuclear warheads anywhere in the US. A staggering 97% of aged care workers have not received the Morrison government’s promised $800 bonus, according to a survey. The Coalition has pledged to build new specialist treatment centres for endometriosis in every state and territory, as well as committing to expanding free genetic testing for prospective parents under Medicare. The Labor party’s head office spent weeks shopping for a celebrity candidate in a bid to railroad a local rank and file ballot in the federal seat of Parramatta, before moving to install former Kevin Rudd adviser Andrew Charlton in the seat. A report into thousands of incidents of abuse and neglect of aged care residents that was expected to be completed by the end of last year has not been released, as bureaucrats discuss the need for a “strategic narrative”. Building a single fibre connection to a business in Barnaby Joyce’s New England electorate is expected to cost more than $600,000, almost double the original estimate, documents obtained by Guardian Australia reveal. The Solomon Islands has signed a policing deal with China and will send a proposal for a broader security agreement covering the military to its cabinet for consideration. According to a copy of the draft security agreement circulating on social media on Thursday, it would allow China to base navy warships in the Pacific, less than 2,000km off Australia’s coast. Ethiopia’s government has declared an immediate truce with rebel Tigrayan forces to allow aid into the war-ravaged northern province. The rightwing presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse has promised to rewrite the French constitution in order to fight crime and illegal immigration, as she tried to boost a flagging campaign that risks her party imploding if she fails to reach the final round next month. Uber, hit by driver shortages and a surge in food delivery requests during the pandemic, will list New York City taxi cabs on its app, a partnership that until recently would have been unthinkable with both camps fighting ferociously for the same customers. Microplastic pollution has been detected in human blood for the first time, with scientists finding the tiny particles in almost 80% of the people tested. Our skin carries so much complex and ambiguous meaning. By definition it is superficial, but our experience of it is profound. It is the border of the body, but also porous and easily breached; it is what others first see of us, the part of our physical selves that we present to the world, and also where we register that world, touching and being touched, in return. In Phillipa McGuinness’s new book, Skin Deep, she covers everything from cancer to cosmetics and racism to skin hunger. On her upbeat fourth album, Warm Chris, the New Zealand singer Aldous Harding embraces a gift that she sees “no point in resisting any more”. “ I’m sort of like the Jim Carrey of the indie world,” she says. The unbearable rightness of being wrong: how do you admit fault in a post-shame world? As the next federal election approaches, many Coalition seats face well-organised challenges from local independent candidates.

3/25/2022,"Ukrainian forces destroyed a major Russian landing ship as it brought in supplies, as Moscow was accused of forcibly deporting thousands of people from the besieged city of Mariupol. Dramatic footage showed billowing fire and black smoke as the Orsk, docked in Berdiansk on the Azov Sea, was hit by Ukrainian ballistic missiles. The ship contained weapons and supplies for forces fighting in Mariupol, where officials claimed that civilians in captured territory were being deceived into leaving shelters to be bussed out to Russian camps by soldiers wielding loudhailers. Ukraine’s human rights commissioner, Lyudmila Denisova, accused Russia of breaching the Geneva conventions by firing rockets filled with white phosphorus in a residential part of the city of Rubizhne, killing four and wounding six. It was reported that desperate attempts were being made to rescue people, including a pregnant woman and six children, from a shelter in Shchastynska, in Luhansk, after the office building in which they were hiding was bombed. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
3/25/2022,"An 83-year old man is set to sail from San Francisco on Saturday and voyage across the Pacific Ocean to his home country, Japan. For 60 years, Kenichi Horie, also known as “Japan’s most famous yachtsman”, sailed across the Pacific ocean multiple times. His first journey was in 1962 when he was still a 23-year old amateur seaman. Horie set off from Osaka and sailed across the ocean for 94 days, surviving on canned food and rice before eventually arriving in San Francisco. The voyage has been widely regarded as a “one-man olive branch of post-war diplomacy” between Pacific powers, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. “Even in the states, yachtsmen are inspired by his story,” said Morgan Smith, manager of Interpretation, Education and Volunteers at San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. Upon arriving in San Francisco, Horie was briefly arrested as he had traveled without a passport or money and little knowledge of English. However, then Mayor George Christopher soon released him and gave him a visa in honor of his bravery. Since then, the boat Horie used in 1962 has been on display at San Francisco’s Maritime Museum. Named “Mermaid,” the boat lives in the museum’s foyer and is the “superstar” attraction, John Muir, the museum’s small craft curator, told the San Francisco Chronicle. Horie has voyaged across the Pacific on a variety of vessels, including ones made from aluminum cans and powered by solar panels and another propelled by foot pedals. In 1999, he sailed from the west coast to Japan on a catamaran made out of beer kegs. Three years later, he sailed the other way around via whiskey barrels. For his upcoming journey on Saturday, Horie’s vessel is a 2,182lb and 19ft long sailboat made out of pale aluminum, customized to fit his build. At 5ft tall, Horie does not physically train for his voyages, telling the publication, “I’m always fine, always in shape… No overeating, no over-drinking”. When asked whether he had any concerns for his trip, Horie said, “Nothing at all. Maybe just being old.”",News/US news,83-year-old man set to sail from San Francisco to Japan,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/man-83-sail-from-san-francisco-to-japan
3/25/2022,"The process of deciding upon a new owner for Chelsea took a step forward on Thursday after a Saudi Arabian consortium was removed from the running. The Saudi Media Group, led by the Chelsea fan Mohamed Alkhereiji, was informed by Raine Group it would not be on a shortlist of preferred candidates. The US merchant bank Raine was employed by Roman Abramovich to facilitate a quick sale of the club after the Chelsea owner was hit with sanctions by the UK government following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Saudi bid was never considered a leading candidate because of concerns over proving the independence of any consortium from the Saudi state, a complication that caused a lengthy delay in the approval of Newcastle United’s takeover by the Public Investment Fund, the country’s sovereign wealth fund. Saudi Media Group said it was completely separate from the state. The Saudis’ removal from consideration appears to signal that the Chelsea sale is reaching the end point. The frontrunners remain two American bids, one led by Todd Boehly, part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, and the other by Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who own the Philadelphia 76ers basketball franchise but are also shareholders in the Premier League side Crystal Palace, another potential complicating factor. Harris and Blitzer are part of a consortium that involves Sir Martin Broughton and Sebastian Coe. A third offer from the owners of the Chicago Cubs baseball team, the Ricketts family, is proving controversial because of the family’s association with the former US president Donald Trump and Islamophobic remarks made by Joe Ricketts. The Ricketts family has said it “rejects any form of hate in the strongest possible terms”. Raine Group is expected to select a shortlist of three or four bidders, with Chelsea and Abramovich choosing a preferred final option. That choice will next be referred to the Premier League for consideration under its owners’ and directors’ test. If that is passed the government will finally be asked to provide a licence to sell the club. What then happens with the money remains undetermined, but government sources insist funds will not be allowed to return to Abramovich.",Sport/Football,Saudi bid for Chelsea fails as Boehly and Broughton groups remain frontrunners,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/24/saudi-bid-for-chelsea-fails-as-boehly-and-broughton-groups-remain-frontrunners
3/25/2022,"Dr Willie Stewart, the neuropathologist whose research recently uncovered a raised incidence of terminal neurodegenerative conditions among professional footballers in the 20th century, has urged governing bodies in sport to review their relationships with the controversial advisory panel the Concussion In Sport Group and any protocols they have formulated following the panel’s recommendations. Paul McCrory resigned last week as chair of the CISG after charges of multiple counts of plagiarism had been levelled at him. In 2013 Stewart discovered the first known case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in a rugby player and a year later confirmed CTE had been the cause of death of Jeff Astle, the former West Brom and England striker, who died in 2002. In response to an article in the Guardian about the Australian Football League’s decision to review the influence of McCrory, Stewart tweeted: “Suggest wider sport also review concussion policies informed by #CISG and their relationship with that group.” Stewart has taken up a role advising World Rugby over its recently announced Brain Health Initiative, which aims to support and educate players concerned about the impact the sport may be having on their neurological health. Rugby union’s methods are under much scrutiny at present, with a lawsuit pending, brought by former players diagnosed with probable CTE. In 2011, the minimum return-to-play protocol following a concussion in rugby was changed from three weeks, which had been the standard since 1977, to six days, as a result of the CISG’s recommendations. Stewart told the Scottish Rugby podcast in December that the evidence behind reducing the protocol in 2011 “was never really there”. Hitherto, World Rugby has resisted calls to extend the minimum return to play, following recent moves in that direction by the AFL and the Rugby Football League. To change it might serve as a tacit admission that the current protocol is not and never has been fit for purpose, which would leave the defendants vulnerable in a lawsuit against the players. The resignation of McCrory, however, who has long been the most vocal denier of the link between sport and CTE, might create some wriggle room for World Rugby to make such a change without admitting liability. Rugby’s handling of brain injuries came under further pressure this Six Nations. On Wednesday, the International Rugby Players association announced they had contacted World Rugby and the Six Nations over a number of concerning incidents of apparent brain-injury mismanagement. Investigations into the incidents have been announced, but so far no verdicts have been returned. In an era when players are regularly, and swiftly, banned for instantaneous mistakes in the heat of a match, any failure of officials to apply appropriate protocols with the luxury of time will elicit anger. The Six Nations did not respond when contacted by the Guardian.",Sport/Sport,Doctor urges sports to review links with controversial concussion group,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/24/doctor-urges-sports-to-review-links-with-controversial-concussion-group
3/25/2022,"Donald Trump has sued Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and other people and entities tied to the investigation of Russian election interference in 2016, claiming that in a bid to rig the election, they orchestrated a conspiracy which made Watergate “pale in comparison”. Trump beat Clinton in 2016. Nonetheless, six years on he alleges she is guilty of “racketeering” and a “conspiracy to commit injurious falsehood”, among other claims. The 108-page lawsuit follows suits filed by Trump and allies in the aftermath of the 2020 election, alleging Joe Biden’s victory was the result of electoral fraud. Out of 62 such suits, only one succeeded. The new suit also lists as defendants now ex-FBI officials James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page; the former British spy Christopher Steele, author of a famous dossier on Trump’s links to Moscow; Jake Sullivan, now national security adviser to Joe Biden; and John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chair. The suit was filed in US district court in the southern district of Florida, by lawyers from that state and the New Jersey firm of Alina Habba, who has represented Trump in a series of failed suits seeking to block investigation of the deadly Capitol riot on 6 January 2021, which Trump fueled with lies about electoral fraud. Russia denies interfering in the 2016 US election to boost Trump. The US intelligence community agrees that it did so. Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated the matter, did not establish collusion between Trump and Russia but did list 10 instances in which the then-president may have tried to obstruct justice. Mueller, who explicitly said he was not exonerating Trump, also detailed several connections between Trump aides and Moscow. In August 2020 a Senate intelligence committee report detailed extensive links between Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager for part of the 2016 race, and Russian intelligence. Manafort was jailed on charges of fraud. Trump pardoned him. Trump’s new lawsuit claims that in the run-up to the 2016 election, “Hillary Clinton and her cohorts orchestrated an unthinkable plot – one that shocks the conscience and is an affront to this nation’s democracy. “Acting in concert, the defendants maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that their Republican opponent, Donald J Trump, was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty.” The suit claims the conspiracy involved “falsifying evidence, deceiving law enforcement and exploiting access to highly-sensitive data sources” in a plot “so outrageous, subversive and incendiary that even the events of Watergate pale in comparison”. Clinton and her fellow defendants, it claims, “nefariously sought to sway the public’s trust” and “worked together with a single, self-serving purpose: to vilify Donald J Trump”. According to the suit, “the deception, malice, and treachery perpetrated by the defendants has caused significant harm to the American people, and to the plaintiff, Donald J Trump, and they must be held accountable for their heinous acts”. The suit seeks “punitive damages, costs, and such further and other relief as this court may deem just and proper”. It says Trump “has sustained significant injuries and damages including, but not limited to, expenses in the form of defense costs, legal fees and related expenses incurred … in an amount no less than $24m and continuing to accrue, as well as the loss of existing and future business opportunities”. Some in Republican leadership reportedly fear Trump’s grip on the party and fixation on Clinton, 2016 and supposed electoral fraud could cost the GOP dearly in elections this year and in 2024. In legal jeopardy over his business affairs and attempted political subversion, Trump has all but declared he will run for the White House again. Speaking to reporters in Brussels on Thursday, Biden said of the 2024 presidential election: “I’d be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me.”",News/US news," Trump sues Hillary Clinton, alleging ‘plot’ to rig 2016 election against him",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/trump-hillary-clinton-russia-lawsuit-2016-election
