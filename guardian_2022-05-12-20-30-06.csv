Stephen I think we felt comfortable together straight away. Cat We started with a little background, how neither of us has kids, and he said he didn’t agree with people who have loads of kids and live off the system. Stephen I’m a postman, I see a lot, and I’m convinced there are some cases of people who choose this as a lifestyle. Cat I felt that what with the council houses having been sold off and everybody lumped together in really poor conditions on council estates, there are people who are not able to find their way out of poverty and so do not see any future for themselves other than having children. Stephen I agree there’s a need for housing. But she was dead against the fact that people have been allowed to buy council houses, whereas I felt people who’d been given the right to buy have had an economic step up in life because they’ve become property owners. That was anathema to her. Cat The Ukraine war came up. We’re going all out to invite Ukrainian refugees, which is great, but I don’t see why it should be OK for people from Ukraine and not people from Syria and many other places where there’s been utter destruction. Stephen Ukrainians are from another European nation, close neighbours, so it’s natural that we feel more empathic towards them. I worked in Ukraine, so I feel very attached to the people. But I also think they will probably assimilate into our culture; they are highly educated and are more likely to come here and start speaking English. Cat He said there’s a family of Syrian refugees in his village who have made no effort to integrate. I said obviously they’ve had a lot of trauma and are probably the only people of colour in the village – what’s stopping him from going and talking to them? Stephen I got the distinct impression that she was implying I was being racist. I can fully understand they’re coming from a different culture, but in this specific context with my neighbours, they don’t speak any English, which creates a barrier. I’m open to everyone, but I think it’s a two-way process. Cat I voted remain. Stephen said he had voted leave and regretted that decision for the economic implications. Stephen I didn’t like the way they were trying to build up a superstate with the EU. But I regret having voted for Brexit because of the economic problems and this issue with Northern Ireland. We agreed that we can’t stand the Tories and we hate Boris. But she probably called me a namby-pamby liberal or something like that.

Cat When I said I wasn’t vaccinated, he put up his napkin as a shield between us. Half-jokingly, but many a truth is told in jest. Stephen She said she wasn’t an anti-vaxxer, she just didn’t want the vaccine for herself. Cat I was doing IVF so I didn’t have the vaccine at first, and later, when I could take it, I just had this feeling in my stomach – it felt like we were being coerced into having it. Vaccinations are really important, but it needs to be your own choice; it’s your own body. Cat We came from quite different places.

5/12/2022,"Spain’s Socialist-led coalition government is preparing a law that would allow women over the age of 16 to have abortions without permission from their parents or guardians, and introduce up to five days of menstrual leave a month. The draft legislation, which is due to be approved by the cabinet next week, is intended to ensure that abortion is available to all those using the public health system, and that menstruation is treated as a proper health issue. The legislation would do away with a 2015 measure, introduced by the conservative People’s party, which requires women aged 16 and 17 to obtain parental consent for abortions. It would also scrap the current three-day period of reflection for those seeking a termination. Formally known as the law for the protection of sexual and reproductive rights and the guaranteeing of the voluntary termination of pregnancies, the draft measures would introduce an official register allowing medical staff who object to abortion to opt out of involvement in the procedure. Currently, some women have to either travel long distances to find a public hospital willing to perform terminations or pay for private treatment. “It is this government’s duty and its intention to safeguard the right to abortion in the public health system and do away with the obstacles that prevent women from deciding when it comes to their bodies and their lives,” the equality minister, Irene Montero, said in February. “The voluntary termination of a pregnancy will be guaranteed in all public hospitals. For that to happen, all centres with obstetrics and gynaecology services will need to have staff who guarantee the right to voluntary termination of a pregnancy. We will scrupulously respect the right to conscientious objection and we will make it thoroughly compatible with women’s right to decide when it comes to their bodies.” Other parts of the bill would end VAT on menstrual products and allow between three and five days of leave each month for women who have incapacitating periods. According to the Spanish Gynaecological and Obstetric Society, a third of women experience dysmenorrhea, or painful menstruation. “When there’s a problem that can’t be solved medically, we think it’s very sensible to have temporary sick leave,” Ángela Rodríguez, the secretary of state for equality, told El Periódico in March. “It’s important to be clear about what a painful period is – we’re not talking about slight discomfort, but about serious symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever and bad headaches.” Last year, a handful of local administrations in Spain were among the first in western Europe to recognise period pain and offer their employees menstrual leave. The city council of Girona in Catalonia said the move was designed to eliminate “the taboo that exists around menstruation and the pain that some women suffer”.",News/World news,Spain to ease abortion limits for over-16s and allow menstrual leave,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/spain-to-ease-abortion-limits-for-over-16s-and-allow-menstrual-leave
5/12/2022,"Boris Johnson refused to rule out a windfall tax on Thursday as the clamour for a one-off levy grows. Supporters of a tax on energy giants’ profits argue the funds raised could be used to ease the pressure of rising bills on struggling households. Here’s how it could work: A windfall tax is a one-off levy that the government imposes on a sector that has made huge profits from something they were not responsible for. The government has imposed them on industries before – in 1981, Conservative chancellor Geoffrey Howe levied the banks, arguing they had benefited from high interest rates. In 1997, then Labour chancellor Gordon Brown raised £5.2bn from a windfall tax on privatised utilities. Labour originally argued that a one-off, year-long windfall levy could raise £1.2bn to fund discounts on home energy bills, which are already at a record high of £1,971 for an average dual-fuel tariff. A further eye-watering rise is expected in October. However the party now believes the levy could raise £2bn due to soaring energy prices. The party has proposed levying an extra 10% on the corporation tax paid levied by the British government on the profits companies derive from drilling in the North Sea. Tesco chairman John Allan has said there is an “overwhelming case” for the tax. This would not only affect well-known firms such as BP and Shell but also lesser-known ones such as Harbour Energy – which actually produces more oil from the North Sea than any other extractor. The oil majors do not split out their North Sea earnings but have posted bumper profits in recent weeks. BP’s profits more than doubled in the first three months of the year. Its chief executive, Bernard Looney, has described the company as a “cash machine” and admitted a windfall tax would not stop it making any of the renewable energy investments it plans. Shell also reported a surge in first-quarter profits, to £7.3bn. Companies have moved to champion the investments they are making in the UK. BP said it plans to invest £20bn to £25bn in the UK energy system over the next decade. North Sea operator Neptune Energy is spending $1bn over the next five years. Meanwhile, the chief executives of the largest North Sea oil producers have also enjoyed a pay bump during the energy crisis. Boris Johnson has repeatedly argued that a windfall tax would force companies to abandon other investments in domestic energy projects. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has reportedly asked Treasury officials to examine plans for a levy. Johnson refused to rule out the levy but told LBC on Thursday: “The disadvantage with those sorts of taxes is that they deter investment in the very things that they need to be investing in – new technology, in new energy supply. “I don’t like them... I don’t think they’re the right way forward. I want those companies to make big, big investments.” The levy could raise £2bn, providing some government firepower to help with energy bills. However, more may be needed to help the millions of households struggling with bills as rampant inflation forces Britons to pay more for everything from food to petrol, adding to the cost of living crisis.. The Scottish Power chief executive, Keith Anderson, has said a £1,000 discount on bills – to be repaid at a later date – would be an effective mechanism to help, offering £10bn of support for 10m households.

5/12/2022,"“It’s going to be tough” says Barry Bennell to his excited young protege Andy Woodward. “But trust in me and you can go from £20 a week to two grand.” For a lad from early-80s Stockport whose mum is having to do shifts at the local chippy because his dad is out of work, that’s a big deal. But, as any kid with an unlikely dream would know, the money is only a tiny part of it. Really, it’s about the glory; about covering your bedroom wall with posters of footballers and wondering if you could be like them. That’s what the Crewe Alexandra youth coach was promising. And, as a coach reputed to be the best in the country, he had delivered on such promises before. He was, as he styled himself, the Star Maker. The reality, of course, was more horrific than anyone could have imagined. In 2016, by now in his early 40s, Woodward shared his story with the Guardian journalist Daniel Taylor. In doing so, he opened the floodgates. Bennell had been a serial sex abuser with hundreds of young victims. In telling his story under his own name and on his own terms, Woodward opened up a space for others. Soon, the endemic abuse at the heart of Britain’s national game became clear. It wasn’t just Woodward and it wasn’t just Bennell. The story’s actual dimensions were almost too huge to contemplate. BBC Two’s exceptional, harrowing new drama Floodlights brings it back to basics. In doing so, it humanises the tragedy behind each one of those cases. Speaking over Zoom, Woodward recalls its origins. “I was very gripped by the film Spotlight,” he says. “Don’t get me wrong, it’s a brilliant film … but it’s all about the journalists. And I watched it and thought: ‘What about the victims’ perspective? Where are they in all this?’” Woodward had already written a book, 2019’s Position of Trust, about the effect the abuse had on his life. But he wondered: could the impact be brought home even more emphatically? Woodward started working with the screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh on a project that would tell the story from the point of view of a victim of child abuse. “The key is to find that emotional history,” says Greenhalgh. “We spent three days talking and I asked targeted questions. What I didn’t want to do was say: ‘Tell us about your abuse.’ Because that would have been painful for everybody involved. So I decided on the story structure then asked lots of questions that hopefully meant his answers would inform the writing process. I’ll never forget those three days, and I’m sure he won’t, either.” But did Greenhalgh feel pressure? To commit to such a raw, highly charged project is to take on huge responsibility. “When you imbibe the tragedy of Andy’s story, it becomes quite personal,” he says. “And when you can’t shake it off, that’s when you know you’ve got to do the story. Once I’d made the decision to do it, the pressure was a privilege.” The film’s extensive gestation period (the project began pre-Covid) has paid off in spades. Everything rings true – at times, grotesquely so. Bennell (played by Jonas Armstrong) is astonishingly, authentically repulsive: wheedling, bantering, manipulating, terrifyingly changeable in tone and mood; playing his young charges off against each other; and exploiting his gatekeeping power and sinister charisma to the full. “How he did that, I don’t know,” says Woodward. One real-life subplot hasn’t been included: the extraordinary fact that Bennell married Woodward’s sister before the truth about his crimes came out (“We could have ended up making three films,” says Woodward). “When my sister watched it, she was really poorly afterwards because he’s that like him. I don’t think Jonas even realises how powerful it is.” But, of course, Floodlights is not really about Bennell. Instead, the emotional core is provided by teen actor Max Fletcher, who brilliantly animates the young Andy. Woodward describes himself as “loving and soft-natured” and Fletcher’s performance captures that, radiating a heartbreaking innocence that Bennell infiltrates and poisons. Gerard Kearns (The Last Kingdom, Shameless) is the older Andy – still a gentle soul but with a closed-off wariness that speaks of still waters running deeper than anyone can fathom. Woodward seems delighted with these on-screen representations. “All the actors are so passionate about this,” he says. “They just wanted to do it justice and get it out there in the world. And it’s unique.” Floodlights somehow manages to locate a degree of redemption. Against all odds, it feels like a journey from darkness into light. But even if it is eventually hugely emotionally satisfying, that narrative arc is gradual and necessarily painful to navigate. Floodlights handles the abuse with remarkable sensitivity, carefully mapping the gradual escalation of the grooming process. First, Bennell invites the boys back to his house, which – in a way that is retrospectively unspeakably sinister for the exact reasons it must have been wildly exciting at the time – is full of arcade games, jukeboxes and exotic pets (“He had a puma in there!” recalls Woodward). It’s a cave of pre-pubescent boyhood dreams – and now we know why. Later, Bennell strips naked in the changing room as he talks to the team about their forthcoming fixtures – normalising his nudity in front of them. Eventually, it culminates with him choosing Woodward as his favourite, separating him from his teammates and cajoling him into sharing a bed – there’s nowhere else to sleep, apparently. He is then encouraged to play a skin-crawling “game” called Follow Me. Mercifully, much is left unshown. Great care has been taken to find a balance; to itemise and communicate what Bennell did without rubbing viewers’ faces in the full horror of it. “We want people to watch this because it really is important,” says Greenhalgh. “So there’s no point in going to extremes or showing the sort of things that, in any case, everyone can imagine happening. It is all about the emotional truths: what was happening in Andy’s brain. I watched Three Girls [the 2017 BBC drama about the child sexual abuse scandal in Rotherham] and there were some graphic scenes in that, and I turned it off. And I shouldn’t; I should be going through it. But it’s very difficult. I’m my own audience but I also think of my mates and where their line would be.” Instead, the emotional cost and attendant tragedy is laid out in numerical terms. The raw facts about the duration of Woodward’s abuse (years) and its exact nature (horrendous) is overlaid, with text, on the wracked face of Fletcher, who carries an extraordinary weight for one so young. It is the heart of the story. But it isn’t, thankfully, the end. Woodward still managed a career in football, although it was truncated by panic attacks passed off as injuries. He struggled in retirement, joining the police before being forced to leave following an inappropriate relationship with a family member of a crime victim. He battled depression and was close to suicide on several occasions. Finally, he realised he had to talk. The film ends as Taylor’s recording device is switched on. In many ways, Woodward’s later life is the wider story of a still-evolving version of modern masculinity; of a gradual letting go. Bennell was investigated (and convicted) for other instances of sexual abuse long before Woodward spoke out. When the initial story breaks, his parents tentatively ask him if anything similar happened to him. “Dad, I wouldn’t let something like this happen to me,” says Woodward, heartbreakingly. “I’d have knocked the bastard out.” At first, Woodward wanted his story to be anonymous. “Real men don’t get raped,” he says to Taylor during their initial meeting. Getting past this self-loathing notion to locate the strength that lies in accepting your true vulnerability is where Woodward’s heroism lies. “He is a hero,” says Greenhalgh. “And this is a hero’s story. We still have the Hollywood ending. Secrets do kill men. It’s as simple as that.” Floodlights ends, movingly, with Woodward watching a youth football match and seeing his teenage self reflected back at him. “I’m so proud of it,” says Woodward. He’s talking about Floodlights – and then he’s not. “I have no ego, but it takes one whistleblower, and when I broke that story, if you look at the line of events that followed, it gave people a voice and other people started to talk. It will leave some kind of legacy to do with helping others.” It’s a process that has become familiar, playing out everywhere from the #MeToo movement to the allegations surrounding the powerful, predatory likes of Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris. In helping others, Woodward has helped himself. Floodlights feels like another part of the process by which an agonisingly personal trauma has been, if not overcome, then at least reckoned with. In a 2019 Guardian interview, he described the ongoing aftermath of his abuse as “like being chained to a wolf. Sometimes you might feel like you’ve tamed it and everything’s fine. Then something happens and it’s baring its teeth again.” Now, things seem calmer. “Everyone who has gone through something like this will recognise it,” he says. “It is a life sentence. It’ll never go away, it’s just that I’ve been able to detach some of the emotion that comes with trauma. In terms of the abuse, I’ve done a lot of healing and I can talk about it differently now. I’m not emotionally attached to his abuse any more. It’s like I’ve let the chain go.” Floodlights is on BBC Two on Tuesday 17 May at 9pm, and on BBC iPlayer  In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

5/12/2022,"Chelsea have endured a turbulent final few months of the Roman Abramovich era and will be aiming to start a new one with an FA Cup double. The men’s and women’s teams will be at Wembley this weekend in the hope of bringing trophies back to Stamford Bridge to end the season on a much-needed high. Thomas Tuchel’s side have fallen short of the expectations Chelsea had in August. After winning the Champions League and investing heavily in Romelu Lukaku, the manager and fans will have been hoping for greater success. They lost in the Carabao Cup final to Saturday’s opponents, Liverpool, and revenge would be sweet. The prospective new owners will want to spend money on players and the club would be a far more attractive option with another trophy in the cabinet. The uncertainty surrounding Chelsea has had an impact on the men’s squad. Players want certainty to help them focus on the pitch. Seeing Antonio Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen being unable to discuss new contracts, with the German poised to join Real Madrid, brings disruption. Chelsea’s success last season was built on defensive solidity, so the prospect of losing key centre-backs will concern many. Not everything can be blamed on contracts, though. In the past few weeks the mistakes that led to goals were uncharacteristic. It could be down to fatigue because they played a lot of games last season and this and the squad could need freshening up to motivate the players. Tuchel has navigated the situation impressively. He will have wanted to finish closer to Manchester City and Liverpool but it is hard to compete against two teams that have been all but flawless for so long. He has almost certainly secured Champions League football next season, which is imperative. The victory at Elland Road on Wednesday shows there was merit in cancelling the team’s day off to hold talks with the players after the Wolves draw. It was a case of risk versus reward. They were clearly not playing well and the improvement will aid the team going into their one big game left. If there is something as significant as the FA Cup at stake then it’s worth clearing the air. Whether it is discussing positives or home truths, getting things off your chest can help to release tension. Emma Hayes’s side would see a Wembley victory over Manchester City as the cherry on the cake. I think there is something special about this group. They had to give everything in the Women’s Super League right up to the final moment to ensure they won a third successive title. For months they have known any slip could give Arsenal the advantage, which will have focused the mind when the issues surrounding the club could have been a distraction. Arsenal did not drop a point from the start of March to the end of the season. Although that sort of threat keeps the mind sharp it will also have left the players mentally fatigued at this stage. Hayes knows how and when to get the best out of her players, so she will not be concerned about extending the season by another week. Chelsea will be confident going into the final but I fancy Manchester City, which I know sounds really strange. They will have had less pressure recently, even though they’ve had to fight for their Champions League spot. They were comfortable in the end because of how they’ve been playing. They won their final nine league games, scoring for fun and everyone’s been chipping in with goals. Chelsea have the experience of winning last season’s Cup as recently as December but City beat them in the Continental Cup final in March. I think City will dominate the ball and they have been incredible since February, really kicking on once they got their best players back. Chelsea will always cause problems for opponents, though. They have an in-form Sam Kerr and as we saw in last season’s Cup final against Arsenal, they are so good in transitions and with direct balls over the top. The big test for Chelsea this week will be recovering from such an emotional day last Sunday when they beat Manchester United to secure the title. Hayes is a great advocate of recuperation, sometimes even more than training itself. The players looked nervous against United in the first half and although they came through the test and were the better side in the second half, there was a 45-minute period where I did not recognise them. I don’t think that will be the case again at Wembley. Key players will depart the men’s and women’s sides this summer. The women have coped better with the idea that Ji So-yun and Drew Spence will leave because they still have the spine of their team, whereas the men could lose 33% of their defence. The squads will have extra motivation to make sure all those players leave on a high after everything they have done for the club. There should be no distractions over the weekend. Focus can be placed on 180 decisive minutes that could be the springboard for greater success next season. The teams have done incredibly well to get this far in the circumstances. Now it is time to finish the job.",Sport/Football,Chelsea have extra motivation to make this a weekend of double FA Cup joy | Karen Carney,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/12/chelsea-extra-motivation-fa-cup-finals-men-women
5/12/2022,"Finland must apply to join Nato without delay in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, its president and prime minister have said, confirming a historic change in the Nordic country’s security policy after decades of military non-alignment. Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia. Public support for Nato membership has trebled in Finland. The president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make the formal decision on submitting the country’s membership application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. Dmitry Peskov said Finnish entry to Nato is “definitely” a threat to Russia. The Kremlin spokesperson said everybody wants to avoid a direct clash between Russia and Nato, and that Nato expansion will not make the world or Europe more stable. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, has said he has spoken today to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and that Zelenskiy supported Finland’s steps towards Nato membership. Other European Nato leaders from Estonia, Denmark ands Romania have also voiced support. The UN human rights chief has said a thousand bodies had been recovered in the area of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in recent weeks, adding that many of the violations it is verifying since the Russian invasion may amount to war crimes. Russian news agencies have reported that Russian forces hit two ammunition depots in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine overnight. The defence ministry also said Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian S-300 air defence missile system in the Kharkiv region and a radar station near the city of Odesa. Firing from Ukraine has killed one person and wounded seven in the Russian border village of Solokhi in the province of Belgorod, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, has said. Overnight the Ukrainian defence ministry published photos of what it said were destroyed Russian tanks and other equipment in the village of Bilohorivka, that had been struck when the Russians were attempting to construct a pontoon-bridge over the Siverskyi Donets river. The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin’s permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. The withdrawal of Russian forces from Kharkiv is a tacit recognition of Russia’s inability to capture key Ukrainian cities where they expected limited resistance from the population, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Russia “is today the most direct threat to the world order with the barbaric war against Ukraine, and its worrying pact with China,” the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said after talks with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, reiterated that a normalisation of relations with Vladimir Putin seemed impossible, accusing the Russian president of having “grossly violated human rights” and international law, saying “he’s guilty of absolutely barbaric onslaught on a totally innocent country”.

5/12/2022,"Annette Arjoon is not anti-oil. The marine conservationist calls the vast new oilfields off Guyana’s coast a “blessing” that will earn billions of dollars for one of the poorest countries in the Caribbean, even as she recognises that pulling yet more fossil fuel from the ground will deepen the climate crisis. But Arjoon does have a problem with who is drilling the oil. She has seen firsthand what happens when the US’s largest petroleum company descends on a small country bearing the promise of riches. As ExxonMobil began drilling a vast oilfield offshore two years ago, the Guyanese government called in the Amerindian marine conservationist to help monitor the environmental impact of what is expected to become the company’s biggest source of petroleum by 2025, outpacing even its wells sprawled across Texas. Arjoon, who leads the Guyana Marine Conservation Society, was not impressed. In time she grew to believe that Exxon was indifferent to the dangers of an oil spill to the coast and rivers of one of the best preserved parts of the Amazon biome, and of misleading her about its preparations to deal with such a disaster. She found the company’s behaviour “thuggish and disrespectful”. “I can only judge Exxon by my direct and deeply personal relationship with them so far. They are not an honourable company,” Arjoon says. Suspicion about the oil firm does not stop with environmentalists. Guyanese politicians have accused Exxon of fleecing the country of billions of dollars by bouncing an ill-experienced government into a contract that pays far less than other countries earn from their oil. Then there is the pressing question of the future of the planet. With Guyana increasingly threatened by rising sea levels, Arjoon is conscious of the impact of Exxon opening a huge oilfield at a time when governments are being warned there can be no new oil or gas fields or coalmines if the world is to reach net zero by 2050. Liza-1 project, in the prolific Greater Liza area, was the first stage to begin production, with Liza-2 coming on line this year. The Greater Turbot discovery was announced in 2017, but is still not yet in production. Both areas are identified in research to be published this month into the world’s biggest so-called carbon bombs – gigantic fossil fuel projects that would each result in at least 1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions over their lifetimes. Together they would contribute more than 2.1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions over the course of the project, according to the study, which identifies 195 similar oil and gas mega developments around the world. The Center for International Environmental Law has also warned Exxon’s drilling and gas flaring “may turn Guyana from carbon sink to carbon bomb”. Yet for all that, Arjoon is glad to see the oil flowing because right now, she says, Guyana does not have any other way forward. “As an environmentalist with 35 years of experience in coastal communities through the length and breadth of Guyana, I see extreme poverty. Oil gives us a way out of that.” This drilling bonanza promises to earn Guyana roughly $150bn over the life of the oilfields, estimated at 30 years. For good or ill, that represents a huge change in fortune for a country of 800,000 people, where more than 40% live below the poverty line of $5.50 (£4.20) a day. “All of those that have exploited their oil resources to develop their countries should not be telling Guyana ‘leave your oil in the ground’,” Arjoon says. “Norway is always used as the best example of a nation that utilises oil, and it is said that they have the best model for natural resources. So why should Guyana be any different? Who is to say that little Guyana, which has been blessed with so much abundant resources including oil, should not take advantage?” Others agree. There is a bittersweet sense that Guyana needs to hurry and get the oil out of the ground if it does not want to miss the fossil fuel party. After years of failed attempts, Exxon made one of the biggest offshore crude discoveries of recent times when it struck oil off Guyana’s coast in 2015. Four years later, the then president, David Granger, proclaimed a public holiday, National Petroleum Day, to celebrate the first oil flowing from its wells. “Guyana’s future is brighter with the beginning of first oil,” he said in a speech to the nation. “The good life for everyone beckons.” The government promised to set up a sovereign wealth fund, similar to Norway’s, to transform the country with investments in roads, education and hospitals. Fossil fuel money is also being earmarked to develop renewable energy sources such as solar and hydroelectric for when the oil runs out, an irony not lost on Arjoon and others. There has even been talk of a $5,000 cash handout to every citizen, a small fortune for many Guyanese. Yet the hopes pinned on oil are tempered by Guyana’s divisive politics, shaped by tensions between the descendants of enslaved Africans and Indian indentured labourers, and concerns about official corruption. For some Guyanese, their first encounters with Exxon have left them sceptical of the promises. A short drive east of the capital, Georgetown, George Jagmohan used to run seven fishing boats. He might be less angry about selling them off one by one since the oil drilling began if he believed in the declarations of a golden dawn for Guyana. “Since the drilling started, the fish have gone. It’s the blasting and vibrations,” says Jagmohan, sitting on a sea wall next to a clutch of idle boats. “In another couple of years it will be finished. It never used to happen. People aren’t stupid. I’ve been fishing for 40 years and it’s not been like this before.” A few miles further up the coast, Steve Outar says his catches are down by about 80% but he has not laid up any of his four boats because he feels a responsibility to the crews. “The fish production in neighbouring Suriname and Venezuela is still 100%, so why is it falling here? Because the vibrations are driving the fish and shrimp away. Some of my boats spend 18 days at sea but still don’t catch enough fish,” he says as he cleans red snapper ready for processing as dried fish for shipment to China. “Each boat has a captain and six men. That’s 28 crew, and each of the crew has a family to support. If they don’t catch, they get nothing. If we’re out of business, they are out of bread.” Arjoon says overfishing and other factors have played a part in the decline, but she agrees that “the massive seismics that were done in the early stages did have an impact on marine life, especially marine mammals. That was when you had an unprecedented amount of strandings of sperm whales.” But she says that when she tried to talk to Exxon about the timings of seismic explosions, to see if they coincided with the stranding of whales, she was fobbed off. And, like others, Arjoon fears not enough has been done in case of a spill that could devastate this coast. “Exxon’s modelling showed an unmitigated spill could impact the north-western part of the Shell beach protected area all the way to the Orinoco delta. What lies in between is a very special place, especially because that is where the largest national repository of blue carbon exists, at a time when our low-carbon development strategy has been expanded,” she says. The government says there is no evidence Exxon is responsible for reduced catches and notes that Guyana’s overall fish production has increased by more than 10% from 2020, and exports for the fisheries sector have surpassed GUY$4bn. And Exxon said its “first priority for every project is to put in place mitigations and processes that help to prevent adverse events by utilising the best technologies, equipment and people in our operations”. “The Bank of Guyana summarises landing quantities in their annual reports on Guyana’s sector economies; according to the data provided in those reports, fluctuations in the quantity of finfish and shrimp landings have been observed for many years. Oil and gas activities have not been included as potential factors.” “We work diligently to avoid any spills. But should one occur, we are prepared to mitigate and resolve it as quickly and comprehensively as possible,” the company states. But Outar waves away officials’ claims, saying that is not the experience of local fishers. And he does not have much faith that the promises made for oil will make up for the decline in fishing. “Oil isn’t going to help. It can make the country rich but the people won’t be better off. We’ve still got to live day to day. We can’t eat a new road,” he says. Jahmohan is blunter. “Are you fucking crazy or what? It will all end up in the politicians’ pockets. They’ll be sitting there drinking champagne and whisky,” he says. “They told us oil will make us rich. We’ve got gold, diamonds, sugar in this country. We should be rich from that but we’re not. So why will oil be different?” Those concerns are more widely shared. Frederick Collins, the head of the anti-corruption organisation Transparency International Guyana, warned that oil “can end up being more of curse than a blessing”. He points to the behaviour of big oil in the Niger delta, where millions of people live with flaring and spills but see few benefits. Others look to the experience of Equatorial Guinea, which enjoyed an oil bonanza that in less than a decade transformed it from one of the world’s poorest countries to the highest per capita income in Africa by 2008. But Human Rights Watch describes Equatorial Guinea’s oil wealth as “squandered and stolen” by the government, resulting in declines in healthcare and access to education. Vincent Adams, the former head of Guyana’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), says that should serve as a warning to Guyana as payments to its oil fund soar to nearly $1bn this year, permitting the government to increase its budget by 44%. “It’s not about the oil, it’s about how you govern the country and how you govern the management of the oil industry. Oil is not going to be around for more than maybe 30 years. So the governance part of it is to make sure that we invest now so there will be a sustainable economy after oil is gone to attract foreign direct investment, to lay the groundwork in education, infrastructure, national security, health, agriculture,” he says. “We are definitely not prepared for it. And the biggest frustration is that the government just does not understand what it takes to be prepared, and what it takes to govern under these circumstances to make the country a better country.” Confidence has also been undercut by the widely held belief that Exxon bounced a government lacking in expertise and desperate for money into a contract that serves the country badly, with the global human rights group Global Witness estimating that Guyana will earn about $50bn less than it would have done under a more common type of agreement. A Guardian/Floodlight investigation last year found grave concern among experts about the contract signed by the Guyanese government. Adams said he warned the government against the contract but it was afraid Exxon would walk away. The deal allows Exxon to deduct up to 75% of the earnings from its Guyanese wells as costs before the balance is split between the government and the company. It recently presented Guyana with a bill of more than $9bn for those costs, which the government admits it does not have the resources to audit. The offices of Guyana’s president and natural resources minister did not respond to requests for an interview. According to Exxon, “the terms of the contracts are competitive with other agreements signed in countries at a similar resource-development phase”. It added: “Guyana’s resources have been brought on line at a record pace for the industry, resulting in significant financial benefits for the government and its industry partners.” The project, after all, is steaming ahead. Guyana’s vice-president, Bharrat Jagdeo, played a leading role in developing a low-carbon strategy and protecting the rainforest but is pushing for as much oil as fast as possible, telling a recent conference: “Because there is this climate change imperative to decarbonise, our policy is to get as much oil out of the ground as quickly as possible. It sounds a bit harsh for those who think you should be environmentally sound, but that is the reality of it.” Arjoon will be watching closely. She calls the gap between Exxon’s claims to prioritise environmental protection and the reality a “disgraceful deficit”, adding: “I am not unaware that Exxon is here to ensure the best returns to their shareholders. “Exxon is not here because they care about Guyana. But that does not mean they can treat us as an uneducated nation. We don’t drink the Kool-Aid so easily.”  For more articles from the Climate Crimes series click here ",News/Environment,‘We can’t eat a new road’: Guyanese voice fears over true cost of Exxon’s oil bonanza,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/12/exxon-oil-deal-guyana-climate
5/12/2022,"The USA will stage its first ever men’s Rugby World Cup in 2031 while Australia have been confirmed as the host nation for the 2027 competition following a World Rugby council meeting in Dublin. Australia will host the competition for the first time since 2003, when England were crowned champions, while the tournament will break new ground by taking place in the USA for the first time. World Rugby’s council also rubber-stamped England as the host nation for the 2025 women’s World Cup as well as Australia and the USA for the 2029 and 2033 tournaments respectively as part of its revamped model of determining host countries, hailed as a “game-changer” by the governing body. The decision to stage the competition in the USA will be a historic landmark for the sport with World Rugby confident of building rugby union’s profile in the nine-year lead up to 2031 and taking advantage of the commercial opportunities available. The bid was given backing by the US president Joe Biden, though the USA are not certain of a place at the 2023 World Cup and failure to qualify would represent a setback. For Australia, the World Cup comes two years after the British & Irish Lions are set to tour and with the women’s competition following 24 months later, it represents ‘“a once-in-a-generation opportunity to revitalise and secure the future of the sport”, according to the union’s chairman, Hamish McLennan. The World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont, said: “We have approved three exceptional Rugby World Cup host nations – England, Australia and USA – providing unprecedented certainty and an unparalleled opportunity to accelerate the growth and impact of rugby globally. It is great for rugby, for fans and for the host nations. “The confirmation of host locations is supported by a new partnership approach to event delivery, that will power long-term, sustainable development, including in the USA and across the women’s game, enabling the sport to realise its global potential on and off the field, driving significant social and economic benefits for host nations. Today is a landmark moment for the sport, and an exciting development for fans. I would like to congratulate everyone involved in making this dream a reality as we look to deliver a truly global sport for all.” England are the current favourites to win this autumn’s women’s World Cup in New Zealand and are seeking to capitalise on the groundswell of interest generated in the women’s game. The intention is to sell out Twickenham for the final and it is understood the Rugby Football Union has secured £14.5m in funding from the government to develop its legacy programme. The RFU’s chief operating officer and former England captain Sue Day said: “We are thrilled to be hosting Rugby World Cup 2025, it is going to be incredible. We would like to thank government for their support in making this possible. Working closely with government, UK Sport, Sport England and World Rugby together we will create a lasting legacy for women’s rugby in England, the UK and across the world, both in terms of attracting more people to play and attracting new fans. “As we have seen from other home World Cups in cricket, hockey and netball, a Rugby World Cup will further advance all women’s sport. The tournament will also deliver significant economic benefits right across the country.”",Sport/Sport,United States to host Rugby World Cup as sport breaks new boundaries,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/united-states-to-host-rugby-world-cup-as-sport-breaks-new-boundaries
5/12/2022,"British oil giants BP and Shell announced huge quarterly profits this month, sparking calls for a windfall tax to ease the burden of bills on struggling families. Tesco chairman, John Allan, this week argued there was an “overwhelming case” for a one-off levy on North Sea extractors. While the focus was on their oil production businesses, both “supermajors” have benefited from a huge boom in trading revenues. BP and Shell do not simply produce and sell oil, they employ thousands of traders whose job it is to buy and sell oil produced by other companies. They profit from speculating on swings in the oil price, and the choppier the market, the higher the potential earnings. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have caused markets to whipsaw, creating ideal conditions for those betting on price movements. Petrol prices at the pumps are at record highs, up 16% this year on top of a 50% surge in 2021. Wholesale gas prices are up near 400% since the invasion of Ukraine. The volatility has made hydrocarbons popular with institutions and bedroom day traders alike. More than 100m barrels a day of oil and other petroleum products are traded. For many years oil trading was a small offshoot of the bulging multinationals, now it represents a vital profit engine, the well-groomed cousin of the dirty, hard-hatted world of riggers and drillers. In London, oil traders typically earn about £102,000 a year but can snare large bonuses based on their performance. Last year, Vitol’s Top 350 staff shared a £2.1bn bonus pool – equivalent to £6m per person. Although the sector is dominated by commodities specialists Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore, extractors are a huge presence. But there is no transparency. BP and Shell do not split out the numbers for their trading divisions, meaning those looking for answers have to make do with estimates. In its bumper first quarter results, BP trumpeted “exceptional” trading, outstripping last year. The firm employs about 3,000 people across its vast trading floors in London, Houston, Chicago and Singapore. Analysts at Alliance Bernstein estimate that BP notched up $1.3bn in gas trading profits between the start of the year and the end of March, and $1.1bn for liquids trading – a total of $2.3bn, just over a third of its $6.2bn in profits in the first quarter. Shell’s trading profits are harder to estimate, but the division containing its trading business, which also includes exploration and extraction, saw adjusted earnings jump to $6.3bn in the first quarter from $3.4bn in the same period a year earlier. Shell makes as much as $4bn a year from trading oil and gas, while BP notches up $2bn to $3bn, Bloomberg reported last year, citing sources close to the companies. Sinead Gorman, chief financial officer of Shell, told the Guardian: “Our trading business has done very well – it of course has the benefit of being linked very strongly to our underlying assets,” she said. The specialists are expected to do well this year. Glencore raked in $3.7bn from its trading arm last year and is on course to easily beat its long-term guidance range of $2.2bn to $3.2bn this year. It would be the third consecutive year the FTSE 100 firm has beaten forecasts, on the kind of form which earned it the nickname ‘The Millionaire Factory’ before its float which enriched an army of executives a decade ago. Vitol, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, made a record net profit of just over $4bn last year, while rivals Trafigura, Mercuria and Guvnor also boasted of bumper earnings. It’s a sector built around financial instruments. Oil companies can agree immediate ‘spot’ prices or ‘futures’ contracts, in which set prices for set amounts of certain oil are agreed upon in advance. Companies will often lock in cheap oil and then hedge against the price heading in the other direction. Traders do not necessarily need to take delivery of the physical oil under a futures contract, and can settle in cash if it is no longer needed. In fact, it is estimated about 13 times the physical amount of oil is traded through purely financial contracts. This means the price paid at the pump in Britain is as much to do with trading conducted on exchanges in the US as the amount of oil arriving into ports. Another common set of instruments are ‘call’ and ‘put’ options, which allow traders to bet on making a profit if prices exceed or fall below a certain price. “You may take a view on the difference in price between Russia and non-Russian oil. Then you speculate that, if sanctions come in, the Russian oil will fall in value and others will rise – so you can trade the difference,” says Bill*, who ran a joint venture with one of the world’s biggest commodities traders. “We are driven by greed and fear. If something is going up in price knowing when the right time to sell is crucial, you need to recognise that,” he adds. But it’s a profession which comes with significant risk. In the early 2000s, Bill was encouraged to travel down from the Port of Grimsby to London to meet a group of US executives making waves in the energy market. “I walked through a huge floor of sharp-suited traders in Canary Wharf. They explained how they were trading the markets and, at the end of the meeting, I thought: ‘either I’m thick or these guys are charlatans’,” he recounts. The business was Enron. It would soon implode in one of the biggest accounting scandals in corporate history. Enron’s collapse has become a cautionary tale about the dangers of arrogant management and complex accounting. It has also fed into the image of an industry with independent players willing to take the risky – but potentially rewarding – bets made by Wall Street investment bankers. This was underscored when little-known outfit Vega Capital made a reported £400m on the collapse in the oil price in 2020. The 12 traders, dubbed “the Essex boys” have since been accused in US courts of manipulating markets and violating antitrust laws. They have moved to have the lawsuit thrown out. In The World For Sale: Money, Power, and the Traders Who Barter the Earth’s Resources, written by two Bloomberg energy specialists, BP sources claim the company made $150m to $200m in a single trade in 2016. Former chief executive Bob Dudley secretly sanctioned the decision made by a management team – because the trade was too large for an individual to be held responsible – to bet Brent crude would finally improve after a sustained fall. It proved a watershed moment for BP’s traders, who profited as oil bounced back. Without a swift end to the war, 2022 could prove equally seismic for traders. *name has been changed",News/Business,Trading in turbulent market helps BP and Shell secure huge profits,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/trading-in-turbulent-market-helps-bp-and-shell-secure-record-profits
5/12/2022,"West Ham are working on a deal to sign the Rennes defender Nayef Aguerd. David Moyes wants to add a left-sided centre-back and has identified Aguerd as a key target. West Ham made a move for the Morocco international last summer but were unable to prise him away from Rennes. They have remained interested in the 26-year-old, a solid performer in Ligue 1 this season, and are expected to make a stronger push. An offer in the region of £20m could be enough to convince Rennes to sell. Moyes would like to strengthen his defence despite having four senior centre-backs. Injuries have hurt West Ham this season. Angelo Ogbonna has been out since November with a serious knee injury and Kurt Zouma has had two spells on the sidelines. Craig Dawson was West Ham’s only fit centre-back when they lost to Chelsea last month, with Issa Diop ruled out with an ankle injury. It is likely that West Ham, who reached the last four of the Europa League, will need to shift one centre-back to make space for Aguerd. Diop, who has had an inconsistent campaign, could be sold for the right price. West Ham have looked at several centre-backs in recent months. They admire Lille’s Sven Botman but are aware that the Netherlands international is likely to be targeted by some of Europe’s biggest clubs. Moyes has also looked at Nottingham Forest’s Joe Worrall and has continued to monitor James Tarkowski, who is set to leave Burnley on a free. However other clubs are further down the line with Tarkowski. The Burnley centre-back is 29 and West Ham’s preference is to sign a younger player. Aguerd, who is left-footed and has slotted in at left-back at times, could fit the bill.",Sport/Football,West Ham working on deal to sign defender Nayef Aguerd from Rennes,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/12/west-ham-working-to-sign-rennes-defender-nayef-aguerd
5/12/2022,"Over the past 21 years, Ballet Black have blazed many trails. The troupe of black and Asian dancers have proved an indie ballet company can thrive, attracting an impressive calibre of choreographers despite precarious funding. Their dancers have different body shapes; they have created bronze and brown pointe shoes, and chucked out their ballet tights. There’s even the fact that one of them is wearing glasses in tonight’s performance – a minor detail but something I’ve never seen before on a ballet stage. This double bill is a well-deserved celebration of two decades in the business, doing things their way. The autobiographical Say It Loud doesn’t shy away from challenges the company has faced: the voiceover tells us of social media trolls, the constant questioning of their purpose, the demand for them to be spokespeople rather than just dancers. But artistic director Cassa Pancho, who created this piece with the performers, effects a graceful light touch. It’s wry, hopeful, determined, proud, indignant and – more than anything – joyful, dancing through a soundtrack from grime artist Flowdan to calypsonian Lord Kitchener to Etta James. The second half of the bill, Black Sun from South African choreographer Gregory Maqoma, is a less straightforward piece, but better shows the rich abilities of the dancers, from the women’s opening bourrées on pointe, quivering with static electricity, to the stamp and swoop of the men, energy creeping through their bodies. Fiery Isabela Coracy especially comes into her own, and the expansive flow of Mthuthuzeli November’s movement is a pleasure to watch. With some seat-vibrating bass courtesy of composer Michael “Mikey J” Asante, Black Sun opens in the grip of uncertainty and anxiety. What follows feels like a dance of journey and discovery, supposedly to face our protagonists’ ancestral roots, with November ultimately drumming and singing, harnessing the great power of the group. It takes the dancers far beyond the polite constraints of ballet and into more full-bodied, fully felt territory, showing Ballet Black pressing forward, still with the capacity to surprise.

5/12/2022,"It started in early May with a post on a Facebook page for second-hand goods in the Canadian town of Miramichi, New Brunswick. A hundred Canadian dollars had been hidden somewhere near the town’s harbour, it said. The following days brought more clues for other locations. Some made sense. Most were maddeningly vague. A week later, the town of 17,000 has become gripped by a mysterious horror-themed treasure hunt, with thousands of local people grappling with a succession of clues – and the promise of a cash prize. “I don’t think anything of this magnitude has ever happened in Miramichi,” said Adams Robichaud, a high school student. “And we just absolutely love it.” Robichaud has been unsuccessful in his attempts to find the money. But like others in the town – where many have felt stifled by Covid public health restrictions – he has been swept up in the excitement of the hunt. The game is run by a shadowy figure calling themselves Roman Dungarvan, and claiming to be a descendant of an Irish cook robbed and murdered at a nearby logging camp in the late 19th century. According to local lore, the cook’s body was buried in a shallow grave in the nearby forest, but on the night of his death, the air was filled with the “most dreadful whoops and screams anyone has ever heard”. The men fled the next morning – and the legend of the Dungarvan Whooper hasfascinated residents ever since. On the Facebook page Miramichi Mystery Machine, the younger Dungarvan posts messages with a distorted voice and the image of a hooded figure. Many of the competition’s locations have a horror theme: one clue took the treasure hunters to French Cove, supposedly haunted by the headless nun. Another was the poster for the 1980 slasher film Prom Night. (The money that night was eventually located in an abandoned school building.) Tim Sutton, a local TikToker, found himself frustratingly close to one of the stashes of money. “I was wearing my pizza costume – something I do for TikTok videos – and searched for nearly seven hours that night. I didn’t find it,” he said. “But it’s not about the money. It’s more about the hunt and getting out in the fresh air and kind of making new friends.” A few days later, Sutton successfully solved a different clue, and received the money via bitcoin transfer. Dungarvan has remained eerily close to the action, giving hints and directions to treasure hunters in real time.. “One time he posted, ‘Tim Sutton, you’re going the wrong way.’ ,” the TikToker said. “Another night he said, ‘Man in the orange shirt – you’re close.’ He’s watching you.” Despite its forbidding persona, the Dungarvan character also has a softer side, reminding treasure hunters to socially distance when they met at a local Dairy Queen – and to tip cashiers. (Staff at a fast food restaurant told the Guardian that event brought in $50 in tips). On the Facebook group, residents have enthused about their new shared obsession. One woman described spending a rare day outside with her husband and children. “They weren’t glued to electronics – they were making memories,” she wrote. So far, six prizes of $100 have been discovered and Dungarvan says that this Friday – Friday 13th – at 7pm, the prize will be C$1,300. A posting for the event features an image from the Friday the 13th horror films, a warning that anyone with a heart condition should not participate – but also a plea for participants to respect the speed limit. Sutton admits the game could be a ruse put on by some local businesses or even the city. But he’s already started trying to guess where the final payout could be hidden, drawing on his girlfriend’s extensive knowledge of horror movies. “There’s so many different horror legends here in Miramichi that it’s hard to know where to start,” said Sutton. “But like everyone else, I know I’ll be ready, sitting in my car on Friday the 13th at 7pm – and ready for anything.”",News/World news,‘We absolutely love it’: horror-themed treasure hunt thrills Canadian town,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/canada-treasure-hunt-miramichi-new-brunswick
