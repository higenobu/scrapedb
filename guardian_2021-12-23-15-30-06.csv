12/23/2021,"Harry Callahan is the cop we’ve been warned about. Though this week marks fifty years since Don Siegel’s genre-defining thriller Dirty Harry busted into cinemas with Smith & Wessons blazing, the general profile of dangerous, off-the-leash law enforcement solidified over the last half-decade of public discourse sounds like it could’ve been traced from the film’s example. Played with a scowl of blanket disgust by Clint Eastwood – Paul Newman had passed on the role as “too right-wing” – San Francisco PD’s top inspector is more than your standard-issue misanthrope. He’s an equal-opportunity bigot, contemptuous of every ethnic group rattled off by a fellow officer in a laundry list of slurs. He’ll readily resort to violence in his work, not above a bit of crude torture to extract information from a perp with a bullet wound. And most hazardous of all, he believes himself unanswerable to anyone but God, who he’d probably just meet with the same glowering frown.  From its earliest stages of development, the script conceived by husband-and-wife team Harry and Rita Fink made clear that Harry’s no boy Scout, but partisans on either side of the ideological aisle looking for affirmation in their stance will be disappointed. Those with hopes for an out-and-out denunciation of this brutish approach to policing have another thing coming, the coarser methods often validated by necessity, as if Harry’s the last line of defense for a society teetering on the brink of anarchy. (The guy can’t even get a hot dog without a bank robbery demanding his attention.) Any gung-ho types walking away as converted Calla-fans have also missed something crucial, however, blind to his placelessness in the city he’s sworn to protect. Neither condemning nor condoning his actions, the film offers what may be the clearest image of the archetypal cop’s self-perception as the only one willing to do the dirty jobs holding America together, even if it means getting dirty yourself. Wedged between Gary Cooper’s compromised sheriff in High Noon and Jack Nicholson howling that we need him on that wall in A Few Good Men, Harry Callahan presents himself as the bastard we can’t survive without. He’s the seminal ‘70s antihero, a man who’ll break the law to enforce it. That phrase is just one of many cliches worn down precisely because they cut to the core of policework’s foundational philosophical quandary: loose-cannon cops on the edge don’t play by the rules, but dammit, they get results. When the Zodiac-inspired killer dubbed Scorpio terrorizes the Bay Area with a murderous spree, the ineffectual pencil-necks in management positions can’t do anything but twiddle their thumbs. Harry refuses to be hogtied by red tape, to the point that his rough-handed arrests are ruled inadmissible in court, allowing an apprehended Scorpio to walk. He’s so contemptuous of institutional authority that he refuses to sit in the seat reserved for him when meeting with the mayor, whom he treats like little more than a loser in the way. If the parts of Harry that won’t be domesticated make him a captivating tough guy and a productive member of the squad, they also mark him as an outsider unfit for a polite, civil community. From the meticulously deployed POV shots in the opening scene, Siegel silently conveys Nietzsche’s enduring adage about how those who tangle with monsters are destined to become one. We initially glimpse a bathing beauty frolicking in a rooftop pool through the crosshair of Scorpio’s sniper rifle, and when Harry comes to scope out the crime scene following her killing, he peers at the pool from the same vantage on the same rooftop. To catch a criminal, a man needs to think like a criminal, a tactic that rubs off in an unsavory way. We soon learn that Harry’s something of a pervert, twice distracted while on the job by peeping on nude women in the next building over. He thinks of it like a perk in an occupation without many to go around. Even as the film acknowledges Harry’s defects of character and the alienation stemming from them, it supports his position that an imperfect police force is nonetheless vital and under-appreciated. When his partner resigns after getting shot, Harry chats with the guy’s wife outside the hospital and she laments the disrespect the public has for men in uniform, jeered as “pigs” by the younger generation. It’s telling that Scorpio liberally uses that same epithet in the taunts of his deranged clues; his traits reveal the film’s truest stances, in that he embodies everything it most ardently opposes. He’s a social conservative’s worst nightmare, the hippie menace (note Scorpio’s peace-sign belt buckle and flowing post-Summer-of-Love tresses) gone homicidal. His vilification also compels the most underhanded brushstroke in the film, the choice to code Scorpio as the sort of closeted homosexual who delightedly cackles “my, that’s a big one!” upon Harry’s unsheathing of his sidearm. We’re meant to recognize that he’s a deviant by the erotic glee he experiences while paying a hulking Black man – another phantom of the reactionary imagination – to beat him up in order to exaggerate the injuries sustained from Harry. Though Harry’s not an ideal defender, the film concedes, his faults pale in comparison to what we’re up against. It’s convenient that Scorpio’s crimes lack the ambiguity in Harry’s policing, that he’s a psychopath who takes simple pleasure in hurting people. In Siegel’s astonishingly taut set pieces, the chief reason this nasty piece of work has remained infinitely rewatchable after half a century, Harry represents the difference between a busload of dead kids and a day saved. A growing faction of the American people have come to reject this premise, a favored excuse of police gone rogue to justify their overreach without this film’s key ambivalence. Harry’s pathology has become more embattled, but it hasn’t gone away. His thin-blue-line mentality is revived in every argument against police abolition, with his shadow of amorality unmentioned. The film ends with Harry casting his badge into a body of water, turning his back on the SFPD for a presumable pivot to vigilantism. Most troubling of all, his innumerable wannabes in the present day feel they shouldn’t have to, disposing of the subtext that no longer suits them.",Arts/Film,"Dirty Harry at 50: Clint Eastwood’s seminal, troubling 70s antihero",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/23/dirty-harry-clint-eastwood-70s-antihero
12/23/2021,"As the Covid-19 pandemic hurtles towards its second anniversary, New Zealand will emerge from 2021 with some of the best health outcomes in the world, despite confronting its toughest few pandemic months. This year New Zealand experienced its longest lockdown, its highest daily case numbers (222 in mid-November), more hospitalisations than in 2020 and a pivot away from the government’s ambitious elimination approach to one of strict virus control. But it can now boast a 90% double vaccination for the eligible population and one of the lowest per capita death rates, while its cases in the current outbreak are trending downwards.  As other countries reimpose restrictions alongside the Omicron variant’s emergence, New Zealanders can look forward to celebrating Christmas and the new year with family and friends. With no community cases of Omicron yet detected, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, sports venues and night clubs remain open with minimal constraints aimed mostly at the unvaccinated. “I’m really proud of the decisions that we’ve made this year because they have stopped people from dying from Covid-19,” says Chris Hipkins, the Covid-19 response minister. “We know too from the past two years that a good health response is also the best economic response – and that gives our country great reason to celebrate.” Until August, New Zealand had experienced relative normalcy for a year, with just a few community cases that were rapidly stamped out, open schools and workplaces, and even 50,000 people attending a single concert while the virus raged overseas. When Delta broke through the border and into the community, vaccination efforts ramped up and a new approach to tackling the virus was ushered in. “I think it’s very pleasing that we are reaching, by international comparison, high levels of vaccine coverage, while at the same time having suppressed cases and prevented hospital overwhelm,” says Dr Jin Russell, a developmental paediatrician. “We have had more days of in-person schooling over the pandemic than most other countries. From a child-centric point of view New Zealand has actually done very well.” New Zealand’s success story has some caveats. The staged vaccine rollout began in February but has been criticised as sluggish and inequitable. This month, the Waitangi Tribunal – which makes rulings based on claims brought by Māori against the crown – found the government’s rollout had failed in its duty to Māori, after it rejected advice from its own officials to adopt an age adjustment for Māori, who have a younger population and are more vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19. It also ruled the rapid shift to the Covid-19 Protection Framework, commonly known as the “traffic-light system”, put Māori health providers under extreme pressure, undermining their ability to provide equitable care for Māori. In the face of this, Māori vaccination rates are rapidly improving, which is largely thanks to a huge push from Māori health and community organisations working on the ground, and in some cases going door-to-door to educate and support people to get the vaccine. “As a nation, Māori and non-Māori can be really proud of the way Māori providers, and Whānau Ora [family health] providers across the motu [island] have come together and rallied for the betterment of Aotearoa whānui [broader New Zealand],” says Elijah Pue, the lead for Te Ranga Tupua – a collective made up of iwi (tribes) delivering health services across parts of the North Island. New Zealanders abroad and migrants whose families have been unable to join them in New Zealand have also felt isolated and angered by the government’s response to the pandemic, which included closing the international border in March 2020. Since then those wishing to return have had to vie for places in the country’s oversubscribed managed isolation and quarantine system (MIQ), with thousands saying the difficulty of getting home has taken a financial, emotional and psychological toll. This week’s announcement that the government was delaying the staged quarantine-free reopening of the border until the end of February, while spots in MIQ were also pulled due to the threat of Omicron, caused further anguish for those stranded abroad. “The right to enter your own country is a not a time-limited, ‘one and done’ right,” the campaign group Grounded Kiwis tweeted. “There are sensible science and risk-based ways to get more people back while controlling the risk.” But with Omicron “throwing a spanner in the works”, microbiologist Siouxsie Wiles said the government must be cautious with its border reopening plans. “We’ve started well, and hopefully people will understand why we need to continue on this path, because we have to stop transmission of the virus everywhere,” Wiles said. “No one is safe, until we’re all safe.”",News/World news,New Zealand ends 2021 with one of world’s best Covid outcomes – but it wasn’t all good news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/new-zealand-ends-2021-with-one-of-worlds-best-covid-outcomes-but-it-wasnt-all-good-news
12/23/2021,"A genuinely inventive tactical role-playing adventure that uses procedural generation to allow for player-created stories, all taking place in a fantasy world constructed from luscious papercraft set-pieces – like a digital board game.  What we said: “A sumptuous virtual tabletop experience that plays like a tale told over a campfire, deep in the woods.” An arcade-like new spin on Capcom’s long-running series about going out into the world with a giant sword or lance or bowgun and tracking down mythical creatures. This time, when the monsters team up on chaotic rampages, you feel more like prey than hunter. It’s a bit easier on the player than its big sibling, Monster Hunter World, a bit more playful, and as camp as ever. What we said: “It’s absurd, it’s theatrical, it’s inane, and it’s fun, a delightfully silly recalibration of a time-tested and powerfully absorbing adventure.” A well-timed return for the best multiplayer Mario adventure, less chaotic than its New Super Mario Bros stablemates and no less enjoyable. Every level is a one-off creative idea, done perfectly, then put aside to make way for the next surprise. Paired with Bowser’s Fury, a new and delightful compact Mario adventure starring a kaiju-sized Bowser and Cat Mario, this is an essential Switch game. What we said: “It is like a never-ending fountain of fun, combining the linear, discrete, themed levels of 2D Mario games with the joyous freedom of movement of 3D Mario.” As the nephew of a famous folk artist, you have to find your own true musical direction in this pretty, unusual game – and of course that direction is prog rock. This spacey rock opera, with flavours of Ziggy Stardust and psychedelic sci-fi, lets you bust out guitar solos to do everything from communicate with aliens to soar through the air. What we said: “Behind the shimmer, this is a touching tale of how to break free of the creative expectations of others.” Set immediately after the critically acclaimed Resident Evil 7, Village transfers the action to eastern Europe, where troubled hero Ethan Winters must save his family from vampiric aristocrats and their monstrous followers. What we said: “A sublime puzzle box dripping in blood, gore and truly abysmal dialogue. I wouldn’t have it any other way.” After 20 years, Master Chief’s saga is beginning to feel like a tale as old as time, but there’s still something magical about this grand-scale space shooter. The multiplayer takes us back to a purer time of arenas and weapon spawns, where you can have fun without razor-sharp reflexes and fiddling with complex loadouts. If this is a swan song for the series, it’s a fitting one. What we said: Infinite’s star isn’t a character but Master Chief’s new grappling gun … This touch of Spider-Man points to Halo’s status as an undeclared slapstick comedy, its violence as wacky and infectious as its story is po-faced. Taking elements of Toy Story and the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise, this enchanting co-op game has a warring couple battling to reach their daughter when they are magically shrunk to the size of dolls. The allegory on marriage is a little mawkish, but the puzzles are brilliant. What we said: “A truly engaging family adventure that develops into a considerable challenge.” An ingenious crime adventure, in which faded screen idol Veronica Villensey kills her rich husband on board a luxury passenger ship and then spends the rest of the journey constructing an alibi. Instead of investigating the murder, the player helps to cover it up. What we said: “From its modest graphics, confined world and small cast, Overboard! conjures something that feels expansive and alive.” Who would have thought that a game about unpacking someone’s possessions as they move into a series of flats and homes throughout their life would be so utterly engrossing? But with its beautiful pixel art and clever narrative technique, Unpacking is exactly that. What we said: “This is a small game, but its meaning and intent are large. Like any domestic drama, it tells us as much about our own lives, tastes and experiences as it does about the characters we are bonding with.” A road-trip holiday through Mexico in a variety of supercars, rally cars and any other shiny vehicle you can think of, is absolutely bursting with races, contests, stunt challenges and things to do. Forza Horizon 5 is undeniably a little bloated, but it offers such a cornucopia of driving fun that you’ll enjoy yourself no matter what you do. What we said: Like any great holiday, there is nothing to think about here except which thing to do next … there is no more fun way to drive virtual cars than this. Barcode-tattooed assassin Agent 47 returns with another set of enticingly open and multifaceted kill missions, travelling from English country estates to Argentinian wineries, donning costumes, experimenting with unlikely weapons and causing mirth, murder and mayhem wherever he goes. What we said: “The final part of the modern Hitman trilogy is a minor masterpiece, a treasure trove of unforgettable player-generated moments.” You’re an assassin embedded within a mysterious island community, living the same day over and over again, and your only hope of escape is to kill the sociopathic cult leaders responsible. Action game innovator Arkane Studios does it again. What we said: “If you didn’t think you needed a hyper-violent interactive version of Groundhog Day directed by John Woo in his prime, with sets stolen from the Moulin Rouge, you clearly haven’t played Deathloop.” This wonderful game about a lonely space-critter, his robot pal and their cross-dimensional twins is a PlayStation 5 showcase. There is beauty and astonishing detail everywhere you look, from Ratchet’s fur to the background animation and cute little aliens going about their business. It’s funny and family-friendly, like a fuzzy Star Wars, and the script brings just as many laughs as experimenting with bizarre, cartoonish weapons. What we said: “It’s hard to overstate how technically impressive Rift Apart is, and how much that contributed to the joy I felt playing it. This family-friendly action game might not do anything revolutionary with its structure or storytelling, but it does elevate the spectacle and fun to a new dimension.” The kind of run-and-jump adventure game that just doesn’t get made that often any more, starring a boy acrobat with psychic powers who delves into people’s minds to prod around in their motivations and neuroses. Psychonauts 2 is fun, unpredictable, surreal and effortlessly funny, a madcap assortment of strange and well-executed ideas. What we said: “I’ve rarely played anything that is so unashamedly itself. Each hour is different, each character distinct and memorable, each new psychic playground full of surprises.” This eerie time-loop sci-fi game is one of the greatest and most darkly fascinating third-person shooters ever. Running, jumping and shooting your way around its desolately beautiful planet feels so good that you don’t even mind restarting from the beginning every time you’re killed by one of its ominous alien life-forms. It’s intimidating, and requires a lot of your time, but the rewards are great. A rare game that remains as intelligent and compelling as it first appears to be. What we said: “Forget about seeing the end. Once you do that, you can lose yourself in the near-infinite pleasure of the movement and combat, and the near-infinite mystery and creeping horror of Atropos. Every try is different, and yet also the same. But, with the right mindset, you can find meaning and pleasure in that instead of despair.”",Arts/Culture,The 15 best video games of 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/23/the-15-best-video-games-of-2021
12/23/2021,"Surrounded by glittering Christmas lights, in between sips of red wine, my friend made me a very decent proposal. “My sperm,” he said. “You can have it if you like.” We’d been catching up over festive drinks and the topic of kids came up, as it does when you are in your 30s. My partner – now wife – and I had started thinking about having a family, I’d told my friend. We had two wombs and a bunch of eggs; we just needed to figure out the rest of the baby-making equation. So he offered to sort that bit out for us, no strings (or body appendages) attached. My wife and I thought about that offer a lot over the next few months. No offence to heterosexuals (some of my best friends are straight), but I don’t envy you most of the time. However, I am jealous of the fertile straight couples who don’t have to do anything more complicated than jump into bed when they decide they want kids. Instead of getting undressed, my wife and I went online. We researched, researched, researched. Should we go for a known donor such as my friend? Or would it be better to go to a sperm bank?  There’s no right answer when it comes to this decision – it all depends on your individual circumstances. But in the end we decided that a sperm bank was less complicated. “Your sperm is off the hook,” I texted my friend, after we’d made our decision. Unfortunately, he was at work at the time and the message popped up on the computer screen he was showing his colleagues. “It’s not what you think,” he told them. Having decided to go via the sperm bank route, my wife and I spent much of that winter in New York curled up in front of the glow of the computer, trawling through donor profiles. While cosy nights scrolling through cryobanks may not be as sexy as old-fashioned conception, it was intimate in its own way. Donor profiles are incredibly detailed: you can access personal essays, childhood photos, medical histories, voice samples, personality tests, etc. Reading through all these profiles sparked long conversations about the things we found important, the sort of values we wanted our child to have. The donor who said his greatest ambition in life was to flip houses? Probably not a quality that can be passed on genetically but we discarded him anyway. The 9,987 donors who said their dream dinner-party guest was Elon Musk (I was amazed how many donors seemed obsessed with Musk) were also out. Again, I’m not sure a propensity to worship extremely irritating billionaires is a trait that can be passed on genetically but I wasn’t going to take any chances. As for the guys who said they were donating because they wanted to “spread their genes”? They were definitely out. Of course, we didn’t spend the entire time having deep conversations about whether values can be transmitted genetically and who our own ideal dinner-party guests would be. Some donors provide their adult photos and these started rather more superficial conversations. There was a lot of ooh-ing and ah-ing over cute baby photos and a lot of laughing over some of the answers in donor Q&As. While shopping for sperm could have been a very transactional experience, the hours and hours we spent doing it actually brought us closer together. About three years and $10,000-worth of sperm later, my wife and I have a beautiful daughter. (To be clear: my wife was the one who did all the heavy pushing.) It may have been an unconventional route to parenthood but I wouldn’t change a single thing about it – any other route to parenthood, after all, wouldn’t have resulted in the daughter we have. She’s not half of two people: she’s fully herself. She may not share my genes but she has absolutely all of my heart. If there’s one thing I’ve learned after going through this process, it’s that love and family are about far more than biology or blood.",Lifestyle/Life and style,My winter of love: Scrolling through sperm banks wasn’t sexy – but it was surprisingly intimate,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/23/my-winter-of-love-scrolling-through-sperm-banks-wasnt-sexy-but-it-was-surprisingly-intimate
12/23/2021," In this seasonal special episode, Alison (Charlotte Ritchie) and Mike (Kiell Smith-Bynoe) are dreaming of a quiet Christmas by the fire, but an unexpected visitor who won’t leave puts a stop to that. Of course, it was always going to be a chaotic affair with their ghostly house guests in tow. Keep an eye out for Jennifer Saunders’s short but welcome cameo. Hollie Richardson Snowball cocktails at the ready for this festive gameshow romp. Carr revives The Price is Right for a nostalgic classic with a Christmas twist. Contestants hoping to win tonight are big personalities including Carole the nurse who, as Carr puts it: “Everybody at home is going to be rooting for.” HR Sheridan Smith and David Walliams star in this atypical fairytale, following Hansel and Gretel after their escape from the gingerbread house. Walliams is also a co-writer, which explains some of the more adult humour – such as the villagers being just as worried about cancel culture as they are about the perils of a child-hungry witch. Henry Wong A festive-themed episode of the longest-running sitcom on air (not, as assumed, prime minister’s questions). After Lucy announces she has tickets to see Jason Donovan in panto, a cheesed-off Lee falls asleep and dreams his entire life’s a pantomime: cue Lee as Buttons, Lucy as Cinders and Mr Especially for You himself as Prince Charming. Ali Catterall As the SATC reboot continues, Carrie is navigating grief after that Big shock ending of the opening episode, with the help of Miranda, Charlotte and Stanford. And fans have hopefully just about got over the fact that writers dared to suggest Samantha would ever ghost her best pals (it’s not her style). Another double bill follows next Thursday. HR Ashley Jensen returns in the refreshingly silly crime romp. The glamorous sleuth is brightening up the dark December days with thoughts of her old flame James Lacey. But her plans to distract herself with the perfect Christmas are thwarted by the need to solve a mystery after a pesky poisoning in the village.

12/23/2021,"I know Squid Game is the K-drama that took the world by storm, but I found so much in the Korean Netflix show Vincenzo. It’s a surreal black comedy, with hyper-violence, bold twists, and a very flawed antihero lead. The characters are well-written, and it’s a great exploration into corporate corruption and capitalism – plus a memorable scene where a flock of pigeons takes aim at a hitman. Clara, 29, personal assistant, Kent  In a year so often filled with devastating stories in the news, it was such a welcome relief to have this hilarious, bonkers vampire mockumentary to turn to on the gloomiest of days. What We Do in the Shadows is a delightfully ridiculous time. Dalton Valette, 25, business consultant, US I still have two episodes to go, but wow! I was only recently aware of the opioid crisis in the US from watching shows like Justified. But to see how one company put profit over safety and created this crisis is shocking. Then there are the people behind the scenes trying to fight back. It’s a true eye-opener and a tragic tale with an amazing cast, screenplay and direction. David Gillson, 52, analyst, North Yorkshire My family and friends are getting tired of me asking if they’ve seen Midnight Mass yet. Set on a small fishing village miles from modernity, Midnight Mass is what you get when you take Stephen King, Lost, Guillermo del Toro and Nietzsche, and put them in a blender. It’s full of creepiness, but the writing is top notch. Each character is well-rounded, so by the time things start to go crazy, you’re genuinely invested. Tom Stokes, 27, student, London Time is a gritty, sometimes shocking, but realistic portrayal of criminality, the prison regime and real human weaknesses. The acting, particularly by Sean Bean and Stephen Graham, is excellent. Unlike many serialised dramas these days, it kept to a small number of episodes, which kept the energy and momentum high. It left me emotionally exhausted – in a positive way. Kieran Gordon, 63, Wirral It’s a Sin should be compulsory viewing. This marvellous television series takes us back to the Aids crisis and gives us a special insight into the times as we follow its characters through terror, confusion and fun. Nobody could have done this better than Russell T Davies and the superb cast, and I want to thank them all. Heather, volunteer, Wales I wish I could illuminate a hidden gem that deserves more attention, but I kept returning to one show. Succession towers over most other TV in the quality of its writing, its acting and its world-building. While the show is tense almost to the point of aneurysm, it’s also funny: Roman’s text message indiscretion near the end of the series was just the sort of unexpected twist that made you cringe and laugh simultaneously. It’s impossible to mention every delight – even the theme tune is amazing. Graham, 41, researcher, Stockport Our Yorkshire Farm follows a lovely family that works together in a beautiful but harsh area of the Yorkshire Dales. It is heartwarming to see the love and companionship through the whole range of ages, and inspiring to see the parents bringing up their large family whereby each of their children contributes with confidence, joy and happiness. The absence of materialism in their lives is a worthy object lesson to us all. Our nation should be proud of everything this programme shows us. Jerry Latham, 88, retired, Uttoxeter Young Royals is a Swedish drama set in an elite boarding school. It has it all: love, intrigue, jealousy, death and betrayal all wrapped up in a coating of class divide, entitlement and privilege. It is utterly gripping and the cliffhangers could teach some UK writers a thing or two. Charles Webber, 58, artist, London The best discovery for me in 2021, a year that I desperately needed a smile and laughter, was the haunted house sitcom Ghosts. I found it on BBC iPlayer and I was completely charmed and amused. I watched both series one and two and gleefully discovered a third series in the autumn. I watch it over and over and it feels like an old friend. Katie Tunnicliffe, 61, Sheffield It’s non-fiction all the way for me. My favourite was the latest of David Olusoga’s A House Through Time programmes. I think this is a work of quiet, but immense, genius. It’s history through the lens of ordinary people and ordinary places, using a single house as a brilliant storytelling device. As a provincial guy, it’s wonderful to see places outside London being explored. How they even find houses with such incredible back-stories must be worth a programme in its own right. Mat Jordan, IT project manager for the NHS, Sheffield The best show I watched this year was the miniseries Maid. It is brutal at times, but balanced with heartfelt emotion. Margaret Qualley was fantastic in the lead role as a house cleaner who dreams of being a writer, but nearly outshone by her mother (played by her real-life mother Andie MacDowell). Jonathan, 39, attorney, New York, US The one series that blew me away was Mare of Easttown. Kate Winslet gives a career-defining performance as the moody and troubled cop Mare Sheehan, whose dedication to her job and the townsfolk she loves often leads her into further trouble. The plot twists and turns, so that you never guess what the truth was and how it will unfold. Intertwined with the dark drama are plenty of laughs to lighten the mood. Kevin Oxley, 59, head of technical services at the University of Hull, Sheffield The Outlaws is Stephen Merchant at his finest. Bristol has a special place in my heart. The accent, the cadence and the perversely acerbic humour bring back poignant memories of living in the West Country. I enjoyed the characters (a group of offenders on community service) for their faithful portrayal of all things personal and moral, without ignoring the costs those choices have on society at large. Anonymous, Malta Grayson Perry’s Art Club was my favourite show of 2021: it was a great mix of the inner workings of an artist and enthusiastic members of the public, with some moving stories and struggles. The exhibition was inspiring; something positive to aim for in these dark times. I love the way it encouraged us to get creative.

12/23/2021,"Typhoon Rai has devastated the Philippines, killing at least 375 people, and causing damage in excess of $500m (£375m). The system developed on 13 December, tracked westwards across the Philippines on the 16th and 17th, before crossing the South China Sea on the 18th. Rai reached category 5 super typhoon strength twice. The first followed rapid intensification between 15 and 16 December, where maximum windspeeds increased from 75mph to 160mph. The second was across the South China Sea, becoming only the third storm on record to reach Category 5 strength across this region.  A downslope windstorm event affected the Colorado Front Range on 15 December, with winds gusting in excess of 100mph. These winds are generated when strong synoptic-scale winds, a stable lower troposphere, and an unstable upper troposphere interact with mountains with steep leeward slopes. This interaction forces winds to be accelerated as they travel down the slope. Heavy snow struck the west coast of Japan on 17 and 18 December, with snowfall rates in excess of 10cm an hour affecting parts of Chūbu and Tōhoku.

12/23/2021,"What if a statistic could speak its own truth? What if a stereotype could confound your expectations? A few weeks back, I was riffling through the local papers when a story jumped out. A schoolboy in Tottenham, north London, had just won an award as a Foyle Young Poet of the Year. At the bottom was printed his poem. Called Welcome to Tottenham, it brought the news from a society that is only a few miles from Westminster but might as well be a whole world away.  When historians such as EP Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm took ordinary people’s lives and perspectives as their subjects, rather than stories of kings and generals, their work was labelled history from below. So let’s call this poem news from below, the headlines as if Liz Truss didn’t matter (imagine) and blue-on-blue combat was a soap playing on a far-off screen. The news, in other words, for the country in which most of us actually live. Welcome to Tottenham. Where we wake up to the smell of ‘Chick king’, Mixed with the odour of the corpse from the night before. Where we cover our blood stained streets with dried up gum, Where kids have holes in their last pairs of shoes, Where daddy left mummy and mummy’s left poor. Giovanni Rose wrote his poem in a few hours on a Covid-era Chromebook handed out by his school. The teenager didn’t need to make stuff up; he jotted down the world he’d been born into. In person, he’s neither swot nor class clown, just a kid who keeps his head down and never swears in front of grownups and talks softly in the same rubbery twang as most working-class youngsters in London today. And with the same unblinking clarity that marks his verse, he knows how strangers see him.A 17-year-old black boy, he has been stopped and searched by the police on his local high road and off Oxford Street, even once by armed officers when he was, irony of ironies, making a short film against knife crime. To policymakers, he’s a statistic; to ministers he’s a stereotype; and to the media, people like Giovanni are … what, exactly? Case studies, perhaps, to be allotted their 10-second clip on the evening news and then chucked away. But a democracy that can’t or won’t listen to outsiders such as him is not only missing out: it’s falling down on the job. A political class that hand-waves about “the youth” would be best advised to shut up and listen to them. And the thing about Giovanni, and all the others who get talked over in our politics, is that they don’t fit their cutouts. They are so much bigger. Giovanni knows wearing joggers and a hoodie gets him marked down as a thug – except they’re comfy, so he puts them on anyway. He grew up in one of the most deprived parts of England but he won’t let that define him either. His GCSEs were a string of 8s and 9s, and if his A-levels come in as predicted he should be off next September to study maths at a top university. Let me admit also to a personal interest. To go from Giovanni’s childhood, in the shadow of the Northumberland Park estate, and mine, right by Edmonton Green, takes a mere 10 minutes by bus but nearly three decades of history. I grew up under Thatcher; he’s got Johnson. He is black; I am brown. Our paths cross and abut each other. His landscape is mine, almost, but as foreign as time renders everything. And so, after meeting and speaking a few times, he agreed to show me how my old world looks to a teenage boy today. Where we ride around on stolen scooters, Where we can’t afford tuition so the streets are our tutors. His childhood home is in a street with a church-cum-foodbank but backs on to a drug house: a small terrace cottage out of which industrial quantities of drugs were sold. Every time police raided, the dealers would jump the fence into his backyard. Too young to know what was going on, Giovanni would panic that burglars were breaking in. “The last straw for my mum was when a dealer got Tasered by the police in my garden,” he recalls. “It’s kind of funny now. But at the same time, it’s not normal.” His secondary school has to help hundreds of kids growing up in abnormal circumstances prepare for a world that expects them to behave perfectly normally. “They come in with trauma, having faced violence or sexual abuse,” says Jan Balon, head of the London Academy of Excellence Tottenham. He has recruited what is essentially a mental health unit, which counsels just under 10% of the student body throughout the week. It costs, Balon admits, “a stupid amount of money” but the NHS services are too underfunded and overwhelmed to rely on. I love but I hate my home, I still listen to the voicemails of my dead peers in my phone One night when he was 14, Giovanni was woken by the sound of gunshots. Out of his bedroom window, he could see the aftermath of a drive-by. Seventeen-year-old Tanesha Melbourne-Blake had been killed in a hail of bullets. For years afterwards, the road was decorated with memorials to her. He was only 15 when a close friend went with a younger mate to try to retrieve a stolen £90 pair of trainers. The friend never came home. A 21-year-old man stabbed him 10 times. Not long before, he’d left Giovanni a voice note on Snapchat. “Just random, like ‘How are you, bro?’” Giovanni used to listen to it afterwards. “Because I missed him.” Giovanni came into a world where adults of all kinds could not be automatically trusted: not the local gangsters, nor the police. Nor others who purported to be in authority. He was born as the war in Iraq went from false triumph into naked disaster. He started at primary as the financial crisis turned into a global depression. The year after, austerity began. He was seven when Tottenham erupted over the police killing of Mark Duggan and his family home was a mile away from ground zero of the riots that would consume London and then England. And over the past couple of years, he’s been out of school for nearly six months, his wifi breaking amid remote lessons and pleading with his eight-year-old twin siblings not to disturb him during class. But with his own bedroom, he counts among his peers as lucky. We fight over streets we don’t own Knife crime’s on the rise because the beef can’t be left alone. Giovanni’s mum drilled him well, both in studies and on the streets: stick to the main roads, keep looking over your shoulder. He never just goes for a walk without a destination, always knows who’ll be there and when he should be back (roughly: he’s a teenager, after all). He lives in what Yvonne Kelly, a professor of lifecourse epidemiology at UCL, calls “a state of hyper-vigilance”. “Just constantly worrying who’s about to come up behind him means a high level of cortisol will be swilling around his system,” she says. “If that’s repeated day after day after day, it could make him physically ill.” And so psychological threat can turn into bodily damage. In a couple of weeks, Giovanni will sit his mock exams, having already faced tests that most of us will never know. And then … well, then he wants to get out of Tottenham, leave all this behind. His hero is the rapper Stormzy, “a rich black man who got out of the hood”. That’s his dream, and now it’s within reach. “A bit of me feels: ‘I made it out!’ I’m relieved I survived, but I miss this space. Most of my friends are here, most of my memories are here. Even the smell of the chicken shop.” While he’s revising for his A-levels, ask yourself two questions: how Great can Britain be, if a boy counts himself lucky just to survive here? And what is the value of a childhood home if you’re constantly taught you must leave it behind?

12/23/2021,"The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has backflipped on his “personal responsibility” approach to mask-wearing by reintroducing a mandate requiring them to be worn indoors while also reinstating social distancing measures in hospitality venues. The premier additionally announced a return to mandatory QR code check-ins at some retail venues.  Perrott’s about-face on Thursday came as the state reported 5,715 new Covid cases and one death. There were 347 people in hospital with 45 in intensive care. Some 1,500 health workers are currently furloughed either because of Covid-induced illness or as a result of isolation orders. Perrottet loosened Covid restrictions on 15 December despite health experts suggesting it was a “no-brainer” to keep them in place due to the rapid spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant of coronavirus. On Thursday, the state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said the Omicron variant had displaced Delta as the predominant form of the virus, accounting for about 80% of cases currently in the state. She said the arrival of the strain in Australia “largely explains the steep rise in cases”. Perrottet claimed the changes were “slight” and said they would have a short shelf-life. Both the mask mandate – which starts at midnight – and the one person per 2 sq metre rule – starting 27 December – would only remain in place until 27 January, the premier said. “We’ve always said as we have moved through this that we will monitor the situation and the evidence in front of us.” The NSW government has been under increasing pressure to reintroduce the indoor mask mandate, particularly after the federal chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, advised masks “should be mandated in all indoor settings including retail, hospitality when not eating or drinking, and entertainment facilities”. Perrottet on Thursday refused to say when his own chief health officer had first advised the government to reintroduce the mandate – saying only that the government had conducted a “balancing act” between public health and the economy. The premier sought to attribute the change to an increasing number of health workers being subject to isolation orders or ill with Covid-19. That’s despite the health minister, Brad Hazzard, having said that number was already 1,400 on Tuesday. “We just ask everybody to use personal responsibility [and] please be cautious as we move through this phase,” Perrottet said. The government has said it will investigate the possibility of providing free rapid antigen testing in a bid to stem the ballooning wait times at Covid-19 testing centres. On Thursday, Perrottet also called on people not to line up for a test unless they had symptoms. Some 160,000 tests were performed in the 24 hours to 8pm on Wednesday night and the premier said it was placing enormous strain on the system. Some 20% of those tested were doing so because of inter-state border restrictions that require a negative Covid test before travel, he said.",News/Australia news,Dominic Perrottet backflips on ‘personal responsibility’ mantra to reintroduce mask mandate in NSW,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/23/dominic-perrottet-backflips-on-personal-responsibility-mantra-to-reintroduce-mask-mandate-in-nsw
12/23/2021,"Eric Clapton has waived the legal costs that a German court ordered a 55-year-old woman to pay, over a single CD containing a bootleg copy of a 1980s concert she attempted to sell. The musician’s management has also issued a clarifying statement in response to widespread social media criticism over Clapton’s decision to take legal action in the first place, saying Clapton was not involved in the specifics of the case and she “is not the type of person Eric Clapton, or his record company, wish to target”.  On 18 December, a Düsseldorf court ordered the woman to pay the legal fees of both parties, totalling £2,889, over the attempted sale of an illegal copy of a CD titled Eric Clapton – Live USA on eBay for €9.95. The woman told the court her late husband bought the disc at a department store in the 1980s. She said she was unaware she was committing copyright infringement by attempting to sell the CD, and the advertisement on eBay was only up for one day. But when Clapton’s German legal team informed the woman of the CD’s illegal status, she responded: “I object and ask you not to harass or contact me any further”, and “feel free to file a lawsuit if you insist on the demands”. Clapton’s lawyers filed for, and won, an injunction, whichthe woman unsuccessfully appealed. The David and Goliath battle, in which Goliath ultimately won, drew ire from some quarters against Clapton, 76, who was already courting controversy over his scepticism of Covid-19 vaccinations and criticism of lockdowns. On Thursday AEDT, Eric Clapton Management issued a public statement to address “widespread and often misleading press reports” about the German bootleg case. “Over the past decade a number of well-known recording companies and artists, including Clapton, have engaged German lawyers to pursue thousands of bootleg cases flouting the country’s copyright laws,” the statement said. “It is not the intention to target individuals selling isolated CDs from their own collection, but rather the active bootleggers manufacturing unauthorised copies for sale.” The statement emphasised that, in Clapton’s case, once it is established that an individual infringement has occurred and he has signed a declaration, he has no further involvement. “If following receipt of a ‘cease and desist’ letter the offending items are withdrawn, any costs would be minimal, or might be waived,” the statement went on to explain. “This case could have been disposed of quickly at minimal cost, but unfortunately in response to the German lawyers’ first standard letter, the individual’s reply included the line (translation): ‘Feel free to file a lawsuit if you insist on the demands’. This triggered the next step in the standard legal procedures, and the court then made the initial injunction order.” “Had she explained at the outset the full facts in a simple phone call or letter to the lawyers, any claim might have been waived, and costs avoided,” the statement said. Despite the judge urging the woman to withdraw, she proceeded with the appeal, which failed. She was ordered by the court to pay the costs of all parties. “When the full facts of this particular case came to light … Eric Clapton decided not to take any further action and does not intend to collect the costs awarded to him by the court,” the statement concluded. “Also, he hopes the individual will not herself incur any further costs.” Earlier this year, Clapton told Rolling Stone he suffered a severe reaction to the AstraZeneca jab and described the narrative surrounding the safety of the vaccine as “propaganda”. In August he released a song titled This Has Gotta Stop, widely believed to be a protest against the UK’s stringent lockdown laws during the height of the pandemic.",Arts/Music,Eric Clapton to waive legal costs against woman who attempted to sell single bootlegged CD,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/23/eric-clapton-to-waive-legal-costs-against-woman-who-attempted-to-sell-single-bootlegged-cd
12/23/2021,"If you’ve noticed lots of posts on Twitter containing a bunch of coloured boxes, then you have come across the latest word game sweeping (portions of) the internet: a pleasant little brainteaser named Wordle.  Simply put, Wordle is a free word-guessing game available online: guess the five-letter word in six tries or fewer. Wordle explains its rules in a handy pop-up the first time you load the game, but it’s all fairly straightforward: if the letter from your guess isn’t in the target word, that letter will turn grey. If is in the word but not in the right position, it’ll turn yellow. If it’s in the word and in the right place, it will turn a nice shade of green. You have six goes to get it right – and if you get it right in one go, that’s weird/basically impossible. There is only one puzzle available a day for everyone – sort of like a newspaper’s crossword or sudoku – so once you’ve finished the puzzle, you have to wait for the next. Everyone is guessing the same word, so competing against each other each day – the reason it’s so popular is that you can easily share your results (the occasional bug notwithstanding): Above, you can see how many guesses I took, which letters I got wrong and right, and even reverse-engineer how I arrived at the answer. Crucially, the results are spoiler-free; it tells you how I went without actually giving the solution. It’s also a bit of a knowing in-joke for those already playing, while outsiders ask “what’s with all the box emoji?” trying to find a way to bully people over wordle without finding out what wordle is It’s quick to play, easily shareable, and sparks conversations online about the solution – and how well everyone did. Wordle is a project from Josh Wardle, an engineer at Reddit, who has (as Mark Serrels recalls for CNET) created some interesting experiments before – including the platform’s Button and Place. Wordle originally launched in mid-October, and only really started becoming popular last week after Wardle added the ability to share results. Now everyone is playing it – and you can have a go too. i have done the wordle 2022: you must show your daily Wordle solution for entry to shops and restaurants2023: anyone who fails the daily Wordle is dragged out into the street and shot",Arts/Games,What is Wordle?

12/23/2021,"The day goes on as it begins: a wet flannel across the face that smells of mould, a mizzle, violet tinged, December’s dimmer-switch stuck on three, from what might have been dawn to what might become dusk. Beautiful. Looming from this foggy myopia is a tree. It is a field maple, Acer campestre, ancient, with a great knot of roots that shows how the field has eroded from weather and sheep scraping a shelter or seeking sanctuary. The root-knot, of Medusa’s petrified snakes, supports a single straight trunk, clear for about 6ft, then opening into an irregular-shaped canopy 20ft tall and almost as wide. The butter-yellow, five-lobed maple leaves have fallen and its winter nakedness is an intricate tracery of twigs bearing brown buds, raindrops and vivid daubs of lichen. It is a small tree compared with the ash and oaks, but probably older than them.  This field maple is solitary, enigmatic, magnetic and sheltering. There’s something odd about its position in relation to earthworks under the sod that may belong to a field system from its monastic past or earlier. Nothing in this light gives away its age, identity or place, nothing feels tethered to this strangely floating land. A swan periscopes above pool reeds, redwings speak scratchily in an old ash, and in the hedge along the lane the brambling are restless. These birds burst from the kale patch like a feathered cannonball, spread into hazels, regroup in high trees, then dive back into the field when they’ve forgotten what it was that spooked them. But even the hair-trigger paranoia of the brambling is muted in this delicious murk. The feeling is that things are going on that the physical senses can’t detect, mysterious things. I received a Christmas card with a quote from Richard Wagamese’s novel Medicine Walk: “I sorta think you gotta let a mystery be a mystery for it to give you anything.” At 3.30pm, jackdaws start gathering to roost. In these solstice days of the guttering year, winter trees give off their own, beautiful mystery.
