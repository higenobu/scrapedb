3/28/2022,"“That was the greatest night in the history of television!” said a stunned Chris Rock, and it was certainly up there with Bernard Levin getting punched in the face, live on air in 1962, by the husband of a woman whose novel he’d been mean about. But was it the greatest night in the history of the movies. Erm, no. This was an Academy Award ceremony which contrived to give the best picture award to the most shallow and mediocre movie on the list – along, incidentally, with keeping craft prizes out of the live broadcast and also the honorary Oscars for Elaine May, Liv Ullmann, Danny Glover and Samuel L Jackson. But it certainly gave us a lesson in how far A-listers will consent to be roasted. And what was so grippingly Hollywood about Will Smith thumping presenter Chris Rock (for mocking his wife Jada Pinkett Smith) was that he then had to triangulate that outburst with his sonorous and emotional acceptance speech for best actor in King Richard. Smith had to somehow try to make slapping Rock consistent with playing Richard Williams, dad of the tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams, when the movie had actually been all about Richard Williams’s insistence on high standards of behaviour and his heroically non-violent confrontation with hoodlums harassing his daughters. Smith’s agonised speech showed that he couldn’t be sure if his best actor prize was a moment of triumph or shame. Anyway, back to Coda, the shallow film which won each of the categories in which it had been nominated: best picture, best adapted screenplay for its director Sian Heder and best supporting actor for the hearing-impaired performer Troy Kotsur. A young high-school student called Ruby (Emilia Jones) is the child of deaf adults – or Coda – with her parents played by Troy Kotsur and Marlee Matlin. Ruby is not deaf and must help her mum, dad and brother (Daniel Durant), who are all deaf, as they live on the modest proceeds from catching and selling fish. But when she discovers she has a wonderful talent for singing and has a chance to go to a prestigious music academy, she is agonised by the thought that she is existentially disloyal on a double level: her life-purpose is now in music, which her family cannot appreciate, and she can no longer be a hearing deckhand on her dad’s boat, without which he cannot trade.Well the film just about solves the first problem with the power of love. But that second matter, of her family’s fishing livelihood, gets outrageously fudged. The script and performances (including, I have to say, that of winner Kotsur) wouldn’t get mentioned in any letters home. In the end, Coda is a drama about three disabled characters’ purpose being to launch the attractive non-disabled character’s journey, to showcase her caringness and all-round loveliness. The disabled characters get to be left behind – and the film’s emotional work is all being done by Joni Mitchell’s song Both Sides Now. Cinematically, it’s a real non-event. Jane Campion’s film The Power of the Dog was the movie which got less than it wanted on the night, but giving the best director Oscar to Jane Campion was sound enough judgement. She made a film which was powerful, audacious and challenging: a western psychodrama which did not conform to generic standards or audience expectations, a movie whose director had a real cinematic language. Denis Villeneuve’s Dune was also a film of great artistry and it was good to see it take home cinematography, production design and editing. (That award which the Academy, in its wisdom, decided was not sexy enough for the live telecast.) Ariana DeBose’s triumph in the best supporting actress category for her performance in Steven Spielberg’s marvellous West Side Story was also something that the Academy got right (although each of the other nominees, Aunhanue Ellis, Jessie Buckley, Judi Dench and Kirsten Dunst, would have been perfectly plausible winners). DeBose was a vivid, passionate, exuberant life-force in this film, someone with an instinctive relationship with the camera. A star is born. As for Jessica Chastain winning best actress in The Eyes of Tammy Faye, as televangelist and prototypical LGBTQ ally Tammy Faye Bakker – my personal preference would have been for Olivia Colman’s complex star turn in The Lost Daughter. But Chastain gave a spirited, theatrical and highly watchable performance and she radiates intelligence and fun. Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast was a film which I hugely enjoyed for its heartfelt, unashamed and unfashionably non-miserablist approach to its subject matter. I was very pleased to see him win best original screenplay – although again, strictly speaking, I would have given this prize to Paul Thomas Anderson for his comedy-satire Licorice Pizza, which should also have taken home best picture. Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car was the worthy winner of the best international feature prize. It’s certainly a wonderful film, though this is an uncomfortable reminder of the Academy previously having had the nerve to give the top prize to a subtitled film, in the form of Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite. Well, #Oscars2022 was a wooden spoon night – and a night of people wearing out the YouTube app on their phones by gleefully playing the Will Smith punch moment over and over again. It certainly wasn’t a knockout.",Arts/Film,This was an Oscars to remember – unlike some of the winners | Peter Bradshaw,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/this-was-an-oscars-to-remember-unlike-some-of-the-winners-will-smith-coda
3/28/2022,"When Will Smith punched the award-presenter Chris Rock on the stage at the Dolby theatre on Sunday night, the comic and the audience were all stunned. “Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me,” exclaimed Rock. “Take my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth,” Smith explained loudly, after the joke Rock made about Jada Pinkett-Smith’s shaven head – despite the actor having recently gone public about having alopecia. Later, when Smith tearfully accepted his best actor speech, he went on to defend his actions by saying he felt compelled to defend his family. “I know to do what we do you’ve got to be able to take abuse, and have people talk crazy about you and have people disrespecting you, and you’ve got to smile and pretend it’s OK. “But love will make you do crazy things.” Such a dramatic defence was felt by many people to be disproportionate to the slight – however public – that Rock delivered. Yet personal Smith’s history suggests why the actor would have felt the insult was too hard to to shake off. In his autobiography, published in November 2021, the actor describes at length the appalling domestic violence he and his three siblings witnessed his father, William, inflict on his mother, Caroline. “When I was nine years old, I watched my father punch my mother in the side of the head so hard that she collapsed,” he wrote. “I saw her spit blood. That moment in that bedroom, probably more than any other moment in my life, has defined who I am.” Smith wrote that it wasn’t only the violence that traumatised him, but his own inaction in the face of it. “Within everything that I have done since then — the awards and accolades, the spotlights and attention, the characters and the laughs — there has been a subtle string of apologies to my mother for my inaction that day. For failing her in the moment. For failing to stand up to my father. For being a coward.” “What you have come to understand as ‘Will Smith,’ the alien-annihilating MC, the bigger-than-life movie star, is largely a construction – a carefully crafted and honed character designed to protect myself. To hide myself from the world. To hide the coward.” Smith’s parents separated when he was a teenager and divorced in 2000. The actor maintained a close relationship with his father but says his hatred resurfaced when his father was suffering from cancer and confined to a wheelchair. When Smith his carer, he said he considered killing him. “As a child, I’d always told myself that I would one day avenge my mother,” he wrote. “I paused at the top of the stairs. I could shove him down and easily get away with it. Thank God we’re judged by our actions and not our trauma-driven, inner outbursts.” Smith’s actor acceptance speech contained frequent reference to a higher power, who he said was calling on him “to love people and to protect people and to be a river to my people”. He also said that fellow best actor nominee Denzel Washington had cautioned him after the incident that: “At your highest moment, be careful, that’s when the devil comes for you.” Smith, 53, found fame early as a rapper and musician alongside childhood friend Jazzy Jeff. Aged 22 he won the lead role in sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, about a high schooler prone to fights, whose mother sends him to live with his extremely wealthy uncle and aunt in California. Shortly before he was cast, Smith was arrested in relation to an alleged assault on his record promoter, William Hendricks. He was charged with aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy, simple assault and recklessly endangering another person, but all charges were later dismissed. Smith’s 30 years on the A-list have generally been characterised by good humour and much warmth towards the actor by public and industry alike. His marriage to Pinkett-Smith is one of considerable longevity, although both have been open about their relationships with other people within the marriage. Yet the arrangement has made them easy punchlines. At the Bafta awards two weeks ago, host Rebel Wilson joked that she felt Smith’s “best performance over the past year was being OK with all his wife’s boyfriends”. Speaking afterwards, Smith said there had “never been infidelity in our marriage. Jada and I talk about everything, and we have never surprised one another with anything ever”. The actor has said that he hoped the couple’s openness will encourage others to have meaningful conversations about monogamy. Two years ago, Rock appeared to mock the Smiths’ domestic arrangements, by commenting beneath a fulsome happy birthday tweet Will Smith sent to his ex-wife and the mother of his first child. Rock wrote: “Wow. You have a very understanding wife.” In 2016, when he was hosting the Oscars, Rock took aim at Pinkett-Smith for “boycotting” the event, in the year Smith failed to receive a nomination for the film Concussion. “Jada got mad, said she’s not coming,” said Rock. “Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna’s panties. I wasn’t invited. “You get mad,” Rock continued. “It’s not fair that Will was this good and didn’t get nominated. It’s also not fair that Will was paid $20m for Wild Wild West.”  In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic abuse helpline is 0808 2000 247.

3/28/2022,"Come the end of March, the lights will dim on the UK’s Covid epidemic. Despite infection levels rising, cases will plummet, as free lateral flow and PCR tests are stopped for the majority of people in England, with other countries in the UK also set to reduce free testing in the coming weeks and months. But while the government has argued it is time to manage Covid as we do other infectious diseases such as flu, scientists have warned ending community testing could put vulnerable people at risk and undermine efforts to understand the virus. From 1 April, symptomatic testing will be free only for certain groups, such as hospital patients and social care staff. However, the Department of Health and Social Care has yet to give details on which other groups will be eligible. After a winter of “flow before you go”, the change in policy seems dramatic. Tackling Covid has undoubtedly been expensive: free testing, contact tracing and research studies do not come cheap. And, as the government points out, there is a high level of immunity across the country and the Omicron variant is less severe – the threat to most people is very different now to what it was at the start of the pandemic. However, the end of free community testing means most individuals will be in the dark as to whether they have the virus, unless they are able to pay for a test, meaning they may go into public places while infected, passing the virus on to those they would otherwise have tried to protect. The situation is likely to be worse in more deprived communities. While the success of vaccines and other approaches in tackling the severity of Covid, as well as less severe variants, may suggest that is not the problem it once was, rising infections have once again put significant pressure on the NHS. Experts warn even hospitalisations with Covid, rather than because of it, can cause logistical difficulties, exacerbate existing health problems and put vulnerable people at risk. A lack of knowledge about previous infection could also prove problematic for access to appropriate care for long Covid and could even affect disability claims after occupational exposure. Prof Azra Ghani, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, added it was unclear how, without current testing, interventions will be rapidly delivered to the most at-risk patients, while she noted the move also raised the question of whether GP surgeries – which are by their nature frequented by sick and vulnerable people – could end up being areas of high risk for Covid infection. Attempts to track the rise and fall of Covid and its variants will also be affected: while case numbers are an undercount of infections, they can give a rapid indication of a step-change in how the virus is spreading. Ministers claim surges in the virus will be detected by the Office for National Statistics infection survey, however, the government has cut funding to several Covid surveillance programmes including the React study, which looks at infection levels in the general population on a larger scale. Coupled with the loss of community testing, Ghani said there would inevitably be a delay in detecting variants – and that could have global ramifications. Even our understanding of the severity of Covid and how well vaccines work could be affected without community testing data to couple with vaccine status and hospital data. “It will no longer be possible to estimate vaccine efficacy against mild disease and so reductions in efficacy will only be apparent approximately two to three weeks later when impact on hospitalisation is observed,” said Ghani. Prof Christina Pagel, the director of UCL’s clinical operational research unit, said one of her concerns is that the move sent the message that the pandemic was over. For some, such as Prof Mark Woolhouse, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, reducing community testing is not unreasonable, given it is not how most diseases are monitored and most people could buy a test if needed. However, he said the NHS would need additional funding to cope with the resulting burden of infections and hospitalisations, a plan to ensure vulnerable people were protected – for example through regular testing of their contacts and immediate provision of both tests and antivirals should they themselves develop symptoms – and provision for mass testing to return if needed, ideally within the space of a week. “It would be a major surprise to me and many other people if we didn’t have a significant wave in this calendar year,” said Woolhouse. While opinions differ on how big a blow the end of free community testing is, experts agree plans must be put in place to deal with the ramifications, and future challenges. “Living with Covid should not be equated with ignoring Covid,” said Woolhouse. “It remains a significant public health threat.”",News/World news,"End of free Covid testing could put vulnerable at risk, say UK experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/end-of-free-covid-testing-could-put-vulnerable-at-risk-say-uk-experts
3/28/2022,"Hiring a car can be full of financial pitfalls. Do it right and you should emerge from the experience unscathed. Get it wrong and the bill can run into thousands. It is tempting to automatically log on to the Hertz or Europcar website to make your booking – but third-party or broker websites almost always offer a cheaper price. This week Holidayautos.com quoted £217 for a busy week in May from Málaga airport using Delpaso. This is compared with the £335 Hertz wanted. Guardian Money recommends the broker Zestcarrental.com – which scores highly with Which? users – while Rentalcars, and Ryanair’s car hire also offer access to deals from a range of companies and can be good value. If two of you will be driving, or you aren’t aged 25-70, factor that into the price comparison, as most firms charge more for additional and younger or older drivers. If your flight is late at night, check the hire firm will still be open when you land. Unless you really are only going to do 100km over the whole week, go for unlimited mileage. Opt for a full-to-full fuel deal – it’s much easier, and you won’t be landed with an unexpected refill charge at the end, assuming you return it with a full tank. Always collect the car from the terminal rather than off-airport. The latter is usually cheaper but you could find yourself being driven miles, and it can take hours. Avoid the cheapest two-door car; instead, go for four. It will only add a few pounds but you’ll get a better-value car. If you need optional extras, such as booster seats, factor that it when comparing prices. Zest offers free boosters on some rentals. Holidayautos and Zest score each supplier, and we’d always pay a little bit more to hire from a better-rated supplier. Our £217 quote for Málaga from Delpaso comes with caveats. The company is not in-terminal, and is rated 5.2 by customers. For £251, you can hire from Firefly, which scores 7.2 and offers terminal pickup. An added benefit comes when you arrive at the airport. Most people who choose the cheapest option often find themselves facing big queues at the desk. Paying that extra £20 may result in a quicker getaway – invaluable if travelling with grumpy toddlers. Over the years, Guardian Money has recommended readers that buy excess insurance, with a stand-alone provider. When you hire a car, third-party insurance is automatically included along with some cover of the car itself. Hires typically come with a £1,200 excess: that is, you pay the first £1,200 of any damage you cause. Car hire firms will offer you “super collision damage waiver” – in car hire jargon – which reduces that excess to zero but will charge hefty daily fees that soon add up. It is better to buy from a specialist insurer that sells independently. Insurance4carhire.com was a longtime favourite – its annual European cover now costs £46.99 but its daily cover for short rentals is very expensive. We prefer Reducemyexcess.co.uk, a cheaper alternative that is equally well regarded. Buy annual European cover for £40.55 for the year, or £18.50 for a week. You have to buy it before the hire commences. Daily cover starts at £2.31 a day. Buying this way is always cheaper than buying it from the car hire firm, plus you get better insurance (for example, the tyres and windows will be included). If you damage or mis-fuel the car, or it is stolen, you pay the car hire firm the agreed excess – typically the £1,200 – and then claim it back from this policy when you get home. Don’t forget to check your licence is still valid, and whether the hire firm needs the digital code showing any endorsements. Arrive in the car hire office and the excess insurance – or that “super collision damage waiver” – hard sell will immediately begin. Just say no to everything. You don’t even need to tell the hire firm you have already bought cover, just say you simply want the car on the terms of the original policy – and will pay for any damage you cause. They will tell you that towing charges are extra and theft is not covered. Just smile and ignore it all. If you are offered a free upgrade to a bigger car, get it in writing that it is free or, better still, refuse. The firm will authorise the car hire excess on your credit card, so you must have sufficient credit to do this – most card providers will allow you to raise your limit for a week or two, if needed. It has got to be a credit – not a debit or prepaid – card and usually in the name of the hirer. The biggest single mistake most people make is to drive off without checking the car first. Don’t believe the hire staff when they claim there is no damage because there almost always is. Examine every panel, remembering to look under the bumpers. Put down every possible scratch and blemish on the vehicle condition report that is part of the agreement. Check the windscreen for small cracks and the wheel hubs for scratches. Is the spare wheel there, has it been used, is it pumped up? Closely examine the edges of the wing mirrors and doors. Take photos of the car from every angle, and of any existing damage. You may also want to take a video at the pickup location. Crucially, get the form signed by the hire firm rep – even if it means a long walk back to the terminal. If it is too dark to properly inspect the car on pickup, note this on the form and inspect it the following morning, informing the car hire company of any damage. Photograph the report and email it to the hire firm. If the car looks as if it has been on the Paris-Dakar rally, check the oil and fluids. When your trip has ended, arrive at the drop-off location with a bit of time to spare, with a full fuel tank and a clean interior. You might think a quick vacuum is all that’s necessary but you could be charged £45 or more if the car hire company has to do it. Sand from beaches should always be removed. Get the car inspected while you are there, if possible, and signed off as fine. If returning it when the rental desk is closed, take photographs and videos of the vehicle to ensure that damage is not added later when it is inspected. If you did cause any damage, fill in the forms and keep copies as you will need these to claim it on the insurance. Keep all the paperwork safe for several months after you get home, and keep a careful eye on your credit card statements to ensure no extra charges are taken.",Lifestyle/Money,How to save on car hire – and avoid getting ripped off,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/28/how-to-save-on-car-hire-and-avoid-getting-ripped-off
3/28/2022,"Bombed-out Ukrainian cities and the corpses of children are not shown on Russian TV. Brave young people in Russia who protest against the war are being beaten up and arrested, while most people remain silent – there are no mass protests, no strikes. It hurts to see that many of my fellow citizens support the war against Ukraine: they put the Z on their windows at home and on their cars. Russian television now repeatedly shows an interview with the famous actor Sergei Bodrov, a cult figure in Russia. “During a war one cannot speak poorly of one’s own,” he says. “Even if they’re wrong. Even if your country is wrong during the war, you shouldn’t talk poorly about it.” And that’s what people do, willing to support “their own” even if they are shooting at Ukrainians. The modern world is separated from most Russians by a revolution, humankind’s most important: the transition from the supremacy of the collective consciousness to the priority of the individual. People identified with the tribe for thousands of years and were completely dependent on the pack leader – the chief, khan or tsar. Only in the last several centuries did a fundamentally different human social order begin to emerge, one in which the individual is free. Before the famous text that begins with the words “We the people” could be written, a new humanity had to emerge and it had to be aware of its human dignity. This huge gap in civilisation has not yet been bridged. This is the drama of my homeland: a small number of my compatriots are ready for life in a democratic society, but the overwhelming majority still bow before power and accept this patrimonial way of life. If, over the course of generations, everyone who thinks for themselves is wiped out, the only qualities that will prevail will be silence and satisfaction with the authorities. But can you blame these people if that was their only survival strategy? Where do those who don’t remain silent end up today? They go to jail. Or they need to emigrate before it’s too late. Two attempts to introduce a democratic social order in Russia have already failed. The first Russian democracy, of 1917, lasted only a few months. The second, in the 1990s, lasted a few years with great difficulty. Every time my country tries to build a democratic society by establishing elections, a parliament and a republic, it finds itself in a totalitarian empire. Do a dictatorship and a dictator give birth to a slave population or does a slave population give birth to a dictatorship and a dictator? The chicken and the egg. How can this vicious circle be broken? How can a new Russia begin? Hitler’s Germany found its way out of the vicious circle of dictatorship. Germans learned a lot about dealing with the past and coming to terms with guilt, and were able to build a democratically oriented society. However, the rebirth of their nation was predicated on total, crushing military defeat. Russia needs this zero hour, too. A new democratic start in Russia is impossible without paying a price and acknowledging national guilt. There was no de-Stalinisation in Russia and there were no Nuremberg trials for the Communist party. Now Russia’s fate depends on de-Putinisation. Just as the “ignorant” German population was shown concentration camps in 1945, so “ignorant” Russians must be shown destroyed Ukrainian cities and the corpses of children. We Russians must openly and courageously acknowledge our guilt and ask for forgiveness. The German writer Georg Büchner wrote this in a letter to his bride in 1834: “What is it that lies, murders, steals in us?” Only that question can accelerate this most important revolution of humankind in Russians: the realisation that the responsibility lies not with your superiors, but with you. Neither Nato nor the Ukrainians can de-Putinise Russia. We Russians must clean up our country ourselves. Are my people up to the task? After the war, the world will help Ukraine to rebuild. But Russia will be in economic ruins. The collapse of the empire will continue in full force. Other peoples and regions will follow the Chechens towards independence. The Russian Federation will disintegrate. But the centrifugal force of the peoples and regions in the world’s last empire can be purifying and rehabilitating as well as destructive. The Russian consciousness must learn to accept that there can be several states with Russian as the state language. The empire must be removed from minds and souls like a malignant tumour. Only then can new states push through reforms. But can a democracy establish itself without a critical mass of citizens, without a mature civil society? “The beautiful Russia of the future” (this is Alexei Navalny’s motto) should begin with free elections. But who will carry them out, and according to what rules? The same tens of thousands of terrified teachers who carried out the rigging in the country’s Putinian elections? And can one be sure that in truly free Russian elections, the “national traitor” from the democratic opposition will win, and not the “patriot” who fought against the “Ukrainian fascists”? A population hoping for a benevolent tsar cannot be turned into responsible voters in an hour. And who will implement democratic reforms? Officials who have become tainted with corruption and crime under the Putin regime must not be allowed to build a new state. And they are all tainted. The world is calling for a “Russian Nuremberg”. But who in Russia will organise and carry out these legal proceedings? Who will make this great reappraisal of the past? Who will uncover the crimes and punish the guilty? The criminals themselves? One can remove and replace Putin, but how can one suddenly replace millions of corrupt officials, mercenary police officers and compliant judges? A long, painful rebirth is the only way forward for Russia. And all these sanctions, the poverty, and the international outcasting will not be the worst thing we encounter along the way. It will be more terrible when there is no inner rebirth for the Russian people. Putin is a symptom, not the disease.

3/28/2022,"As Boris Johnson prepares a new push for nuclear power, the £131bn problem of how to safely dispose of vast volumes of radioactive waste created by the last British atomic energy programme remains unsolved. The hugely expensive and dangerous legacy of the UK’s 20th-century nuclear revolution amounts to 700,000 cubic metres of toxic waste – roughly the volume of 6,000 doubledecker buses. Much of it is stored at Sellafield in Cumbria, which the Office for Nuclear Regulation says is one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites in the world. As yet, there is nowhere to safely and permanently deposit this waste. Nearly 50 years ago the solution of a deep geological disposal facility (GDF) was put forward, but decades later the UK is no nearer to building one. Experts say new nuclear facilities will only add to the problem of what to do with radioactive waste from nuclear energy and that the “back end” issue of the hazardous toxic waste from the technology must not be hidden. An assessment by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) says spent fuel from new nuclear reactors will be of such high temperatures it would need to stay on site for 140 years before it could be removed to a GDF, if one is ever built in the UK. The prime minister’s nuclear ambition, it is understood, rests with even more modern nuclear reactors, known as advanced modular reactors. But nuclear waste experts say no one knows how to deal with the waste from such reactors, because they are such a new technology. “It is essential to talk about the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle when you are considering building new nuclear power stations,” said Claire Corkhill, a professor of nuclear material degradation at the University of Sheffield and a member of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, an independent body that advises the government. “Whilst we have a plan to finally and safely deal with the waste, it is less certain how this will be applied to the modern nuclear reactors that the government are planning to roll out. “These are completely different to previous reactors and we are at a very early stage of understanding how to deal with the waste. In my personal view, I do not think we should be building any new nuclear reactors until we have a geological disposal facility available.” The cost of decommissioning and disposing of the radioactive waste from nuclear power stations built in the 1950s, 1970s and 1990s has risen to £131bn, according to the latest NDA annual report. This is likely to rise further as the costs of building a deep geological disposal site rise to up to £53bn. Attempts to build an underground dump for nuclear waste have so far failed. Nine years ago an attempt to site one in Cumbria was rejected. A new attempt to find a site is in its early stages. Three sites in Cumbria and one in Lincolnshire are being examined. If it goes ahead, it could be years before building starts, and the GDF would only be available to receive waste from the late 2040s. “The amount of legacy waste is not small in terms of nuclear waste,” said Corkhill. “It is expensive to deal with. These materials are hazardous and we are looking at an underground footprint of some 20km at a depth of 200 metres to 1,000 metres. So regarding new nuclear sites, we need to think about whether it is possible to build a GDF big enough for all the legacy waste and the new nuclear waste.” The power stations that need decommissioning include 11 Magnox power stations built between the 1950s and 1970s, including Dungeness A in Kent, Hinkley Point A in Somerset and Trawsfynydd in north Wales, and seven advanced gas-cooled reactors built in the 1990s, including Dungeness B, which closed last year, Hinkley Point B and Heysham 1 and 2 in Lancashire. Waste from more recent nuclear facilities including Sizewell B, a pressurised water reactor in Suffolk, and two new EDF pressurised water reactors – Hinkley C, which is under construction in Somerset, and Sizewell C, which is planned for construction in Suffolk – will also need to be deposited in a GDF. It is likely to take until 2150 to deposit the legacy waste into a GDF, if one is built. Only then would a GDF be able to take waste from new nuclear reactors. Steve Thomas, a professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said: “Despite 65 years of using nuclear power in Britain, we are still, at best, decades away from having facilities to safely dispose of the waste. Until we know this can be done, it is premature to embark on a major new programme of nuclear power plants.” NDA documents show that as of 2019, the volume of nuclear waste that needs to be permanently disposed of in a deep GDF is 773,000 cubic metres. Of that waste, 10% is from new nuclear facilities, while the rest is legacy waste. A government spokesperson said: “​This is not an either/or situation. As the prime minister has said, nuclear will be a key part of our upcoming energy security strategy alongside renewables.

3/28/2022,"“This book has been a thorn in my side for almost seven years,” writes singer-songwriter Martha Wainwright near the close of her engrossing memoir, an account produced through the lonely tumult of a custody battle, in the wake of grief, then galvanised by new hope. “I’ve burned copies and used the backs of pages as scrap paper on which I taught my kids addition and subtraction,” she continues. “An early draft was used as evidence against me in my divorce case.” Much like her album of last year, Love Will Be Reborn, which processes some of the same material, very little feels off-limits in this slim but jam-packed book, full of very good times in the circus that is a performer’s life as well as very bad times. Wainwright is, of course, a singer-songwriter of great acuity and candour with six solo studio albums under her belt, with a surname that is both gift and bind. She was born into an extended family of artists who have a habit of skewering one another in song and print. Her late mother, the Canadian folk artist Kate McGarrigle’s song Go Leave is about her ex-husband, the US singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III, whose When You Leave also ponders the fallout of his departure on their then young children, Martha and her brother, Rufus, also a singer-songwriter. Well before the stars of social media, you could argue the Wainwright-McGarrigles have long provided a much more genteel, bohemian sort of dysfunctional showbiz dynasty to boggle at. Their extended clan forms part of a wider folk and entertainment pantheon that stretches from Montreal to LA via London and New York, so there are also walk-on parts in this book for everyone from Emmylou Harris, friendly with Wainwright’s mother, to Pete Doherty, wasted at Glastonbury, via US TV’s Jimmy Fallon, a long-time pal of Martha’s. Wainwright’s own 2005 launch pad of a single, Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole, was, legend has it, about her complicated relationship with her father. Here, though, she says Loudon was more of a springboard for a wider j’accuse aimed at entitled men and unfair practices, not least how the world received the sons of famous singer-songwriters (such as Rufus and his friends Sean Lennon, Chris Stills and Harper Simon) so much more enthusiastically than the daughters. We learn, too, that Loudon’s cruel song about preferring solitude to female company, I’d Rather Be Lonely, is about Martha, not a lover. Finding that out in public actually hurt her far more than another song her father wrote about her called Hitting You. Wainwright’s is, at heart, also a very female story, full of difficult births, of dumping pumped breast milk after too much wine, of balancing the demands of an unconventional career and now single parenthood. There is much closeness with her mother, her aunt Anna McGarrigle, and another aunt, Teddy; love and loyalty offset by everyone’s flaws. The echoes down the generations, though, are startling. Kate McGarrigle had a long relationship with her bass player, Pat, who was a solid stepfather to the young Martha and whose abrupt removal from her childhood still feels raw. More recently, Wainwright’s estranged partner, Brad, used to be her bassist. As Kate’s cancer takes hold in 2010, Martha gives birth prematurely at a London hospital, where mother and child remain for some time before baby Arcangelo is strong enough to leave. A lifetime previously, Kate and Loudon Wainwright had a frail baby in a hospital just down the road. That baby didn’t make it. Despite this book’s manuscript being weaponised against Wainwright in her divorce, the stories that she might regret telling are not, you suspect, the ones about her brief period smoking heroin as a younger woman, or the time she blacked out and split her head open (more drugs), but the occasions where her shame runs on the page. While her mother is ill and resting, already fighting the cancer that would end her life, Wainwright gets wrecked with her friends within earshot on two separate occasions. Open wounds fester in her wider circle too. Lorca Cohen, daughter of Leonard, was once one of Wainwright’s very closest childhood friends; so close she helped her choose her wedding dress. “If I were to paint her portrait,” writes the singer now, “there would be a wide and deep backdrop of still burning bridges.” Her brother, Rufus, and Lorca have a child together through sperm donation. Reading between the lines, the co-parenting arrangements have probably not gone as smoothly as hoped. Is it any surprise, given everyone’s lineage? This is a memoir full of talented, headstrong people recycling their pain as songcraft; of ambitions pursued or curtailed, and of love frequently tinged with other things – rivalry, frustration, not measuring up. For all the epigenetic baggage, though, it is above all the story of Wainwright’s gutsy, instinctual pursuit of her own muse.

3/28/2022,"Liam, 18, who has learning disabilities, had always been told by family members that he would never find work. It was upsetting to hear but, with 95% of people with learning disabilities unemployed, not an unreasonable assumption. When he secured a job planting trees for a conservation charity, he was so happy he burst into tears. Liam got his job thanks to an unusual training and employment scheme set up by an award-winning special educational needs and disabilities (Send) school, Market Field in Elmstead, Essex. The scheme seeks to address the woeful employment prospects for the school’s graduates. Autistic people and people with ADHD and learning disabilities struggle to find work throughout the UK, but especially so in deprived rural areas such as east Essex. For Liam, the job has boosted his self-esteem as well as his finances. “I like being out and about, I like working. The job means a lot,” he said. “I’ve got used to everyone else, I wouldn’t want to work with other people because they wouldn’t understand me.” Liam spent his first pay packet buying Christmas presents for his family, and he plans to use the next one to take his girlfriend out for dinner. Although he was buffeted by a bitter Essex wind while he planted a row of hawthorn trees on a cold day in February, the pride in his work was visible. Naomi Andrews, who runs the project on behalf of the school, works with local conservation organisations to arrange the placements and salaries for the students, and provides extra support and training to convince employers that they need not fear hiring people with Send. “Employers expect people with special needs to volunteer. But it’s demoralising. Most of these guys never thought they’d work,” she said. The results have been impressive. Last winter the team planted 60,800 trees, mostly working with Big Green Planet, a charity that restores hedgerows to improve local wildlife populations. The pupils describe their shifts as the highlight of their week, enthusiasm that has not gone unnoticed by the charity, which said their tenacity and good humour surpassed that of contract workers. The project is small for now, with seven pupils employed this year and 12 pencilled in for next year. But the school is busy setting up Market Field farm, which will open to visitors in August 2023. It will be entirely staffed by 70 pupils and school leavers, equipping them with valuable horticulture and hospitality skills to improve their employment prospects, as well as a salary, and aims to become the first commercially self-sustaining Send employment scheme in a rural area. There are plans to continue growing in years to come. As part of the innovative model, the £1.5m cost of the farm’s buildings, 2.5 hectares (six acres) of land and infrastructure are funded by developers looking to take advantage of rapidly growing demand for housing in the area. The arrangement is mutually beneficial because in order to build new plots, developers have to demonstrate a positive impact on the local community under their section 106 agreement. Gary Smith, the executive head for the Hope Learning Community, which runs Market Field school, sees the project as a grassroots attempt to fill a policy vacuum in government around getting school leavers with Send into work. Surprised by an absence of hard data on the employment destinations of Send pupils, and how “ineffective” the small number of existing schemes are, and after a string of unsuccessful meetings with government officials, Smith realised that “nothing was going to happen unless we made it happen”. His determination is the result of watching pupils thrive at his school, then leave and spend years in their bedrooms, with about nine in 10 unable to find work due to stigma and a lack of awareness from employers about the skills they can bring. Getting his school leavers into work would also free family members from caring responsibilities, and reduce reliance on unemployment benefits. “Their lives are shattered. I’ve seen so many lives that could have been different,” he said. A government spokesperson said the national disability strategy and new investment in a supported internship programme were “improving outcomes for young people with special educational needs”, while a multibillion-pound plan for jobs aimed to help “more disabled jobseekers to find, retain and progress in fulfilling work” through specialist programmes and support from work coaches and disability employment advisers.",News/Education,‘The job means a lot’: the scheme helping Send school leavers find work,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/28/the-job-means-a-lot-the-scheme-helping-send-school-leavers-find-work
3/28/2022,"For nearly 30 years, Mitch Law went to work in the same office – four metres square, with a window that overlooked a car park. As an IT manager in Warrington, he wasn’t isolated. Besides, his wife Bernice was a colleague. But Law spent his working life tethered to a desk in a room like a box. When they both applied for redundancy, Bernice was turned down. “But for me, they went, ‘Mitch, oh right, 28 years – yeah, byeee!’” He must think of his tiny office when he is flying Chokky, the Harris hawk he bought in 2019, when he was 65. “I walk up a bit of a ridge. The west wind’s coming. He goes out of sight and then slowly works his way back, working the wind, until he hovers above me, hanging in the wind, looking down at me. When he lands on my glove you can hardly feel him, he’s so soft. I never get sick of it.” Law had no family history of falconry, but when Bernice retired five years later, it spurred him to action. “That’s when I realised that she was going to catch me doing nothing all day. I thought, what shall I do? “I rang up our local falconry and asked if they wanted any volunteers. They said, ‘Come along on Monday.’” It must have felt strange turning up as a novice; he had been there only once, when Bernice gave him a falconry experience for his 50th birthday. “The first thing you get shown is cleaning. Sixty birds – that’s a lot of poo.” Next he learned to tie the jesses, to secure the birds to the glove. He practised the “falconer’s knot” at home on the bathroom towel-holder. “Slowly I gained knowledge and I never stopped learning. The contrast between being in that office – centrally heated, nice and warm, cup of tea – to going out every morning – rain, shine, cold … It was invigorating.” After five years as a volunteer, he bought Chokky. For the first two weeks, the hawk would not eat. Law sat in the dark in Chokky’s mews (as falconers call their birdhouses), with the bird on his fist. After a few days, he let in light. Next, he took Chokky to the kitchen; they would sit watching telly. Law feared the hawk “would die of dehydration”. Then, one day, Chokky gobbled the food Law offered him; two days later he hopped from the gatepost to Law’s glove. Within a week, he was flying free. “Harris hawks just get it. In the wild they hunt in family packs,” and work well with people because of that, Law says. Law describes himself as a doer; management profile tests have told him this. Before retiring, he tried flying model aircraft, canoeing, kickboxing, surfing and golf. His father was a doer too, “a very accomplished man” who hand-built boats and flew model aircraft at the same club Law later attended. He had left home at 17 “because of friction” between them. He tried lots of jobs, from deep-sea trawling to wire drawing, working in shops, factories and warehouses, before discovering his talent for computer programming. “Men have to leave home, make their own way and come back to appreciate their dads,” Law says. In adulthood, he and his father became close. Unlike the myriad pursuits he had tried before, “Falconry was something I loved immediately and stuck with,” he says. “I know Dad would have absolutely loved it and joined me. “I sometimes say to Bernice, ‘Let me work this out again. Am I 68?’” It doesn’t seem long since he used to wonder, as older colleagues celebrated their 40th birthdays, “What are they going to do now they are so old?” Chokky is likely to live about 25 years, Law says. “He will probably out-see me. So that will be my future as a falconer. And I know in my heart I will always love it.” Climbing the ridge to release the hawk is beginning to feel like hard work – Law is “not in great health” now – but nothing will stop him from flying Chokky. “When I get to a point where I can’t hop over that gate and get up that ridge, I’ll fly him out of the tree in my garden.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,"A new start after 60: I worked in a tiny office for 30 years – then I took up falconry and am out in rain, shine and cold’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/28/a-new-start-after-60-i-worked-in-a-tiny-office-for-30-years-then-i-took-up-falconry-and-am-out-in-rain-shine-and-cold
3/28/2022,"Railways in Europe are many things. With their grand stations, history and evocative destinations, they evoke a timelessness that is absent from the uniform experience of flying. In recent decades, high-speed services have complemented classic routes, while the demand for more climate-friendly travel has grown and new options have sprung up, including a recent wave of night trains. Lonely Planet, which for nearly 50 years has championed a down-to-earth, connected style of travel, has produced a new Guide to Train Travel in Europe aimed at unlocking adventures by rail from any starting point on the continent. Here the authors pick fantastic journeys from the book. A well-established network of high-speed trains and a huge choice of slower options connects two of Europe’s great cities. A glorious three-country tour would allow you to head from Paris to Brussels, travelling on to Cologne via the space-age architecture of Liège-Guillemins station. Cologne’s cathedral is so close to the station you can hardly miss popping in before boarding an onward ICE German fast service to the capital, which takes less than five hours. To see more than the immediate surroundings of the station buildings in each city, book separate tickets for each leg at trainline.com, or add in a stop of a few hours or an overnight booking via Deutsche Bahn (bahn.de). A high-speed connection from Paris via Frankfurt is also possible. One of several recent additions to Europe’s sleeper train scene, the Nightjet service operated by Austrian Railways (oebb.at) departs every evening at 7pm or 7.30pm from Amsterdam. As you doze off, the train will trundle alongside the Rhine, passing Cologne and Koblenz, then continuing south-east through Germany and entering Austria at Passau. A 9.19am arrival in Vienna ensures time for a lie-in and breakfast. This train can easily be combined with the Eurostar service from London or a ferry from Newcastle to Amsterdam, or from Harwich to Hoek van Holland. Some of the world’s most beautiful narrow-gauge railways can be found in Wales and two of the best can be combined in a loop that takes in the mountains and coastal scenery of Snowdonia. Catch a service from Llandudno Junction – which has main line connections – down the Conwy valley to Blaenau Ffestiniog. Change for the celebrated Ffestiniog Railway, a distinctive steam-hauled service that winds 13 miles down to the coast at Porthmadog. Return via the sublime steam service of the Welsh Highland Railway under the summit of Snowdon to Caernarfon, where you can catch a bus to Bangor and main line services. The Chemins de Fer de la Corse (Corsican Railways) is a narrow-gauge railway centred on Ponte Leccia – from where three main lines head to Ajaccio, Bastia and Calvi, all providing incredible views of beautiful and rugged terrain. The route linking Ajaccio and Bastia is the longest and most celebrated, taking three and a half hours, so is best done with an overnight stop, rather than attempted as a day trip. Corsica is well served by ferries from mainland France such as Toulon, Marseille and Nice, opening up a tempting train-and-ferry route from the UK. It is possible to head from Dublin direct to mainland Europe. A largely single-track line skirts the Irish Sea heading south as far as Wicklow before veering inland and stopping in the appealing county town of Wexford, set on the estuary of the River Slaney. It’s a short hop along the tracks from there to the port of Rosslare for the twice-weekly ferries to Bilbao, which take about 30 hours. Then it’s a five-hour rail journey on to Madrid. Recommended stops take in Burgos’s treasured cathedral, the former Spanish capital of Valladolid and Segovia’s Roman aqueduct and Alcázar fortress. Heading from top to toe in Italy, this dramatic journey’s potential stopping points need no introduction. Fast Frecciarossa trains connect Venice to the gastronomic centre of Bologna in 90 minutes, with Florence 40 minutes down the line. An hour and a half further on you’re in Rome. From here the south of Italy opens up. For one of Europe’s most unusual rail experiences take a train service all the way to Sicily. At Villa San Giovanni in Calabria, you and your carriage board a dedicated ferry to Messina, in Sicily, from where the hectic fun of Palermo is a slow-rolling four and a half hours’ ride away along the coast. There are several daily intercity and night services that run from the mainland, via the ferry, through to the Sicilian capital including sleepers direct from Milan, Genoa and Pisa. A contender for Europe’s best train trip, the Bergen Line (Bergensbanen) thunders past southern Norway’s mountains and lakes between Oslo and Bergen, reaching 1,222m at Finse station, where a snowball fight is generally on offer. The trip takes nearly seven hours, which passes quickly in a blur of incredible scenery on a comfortable intercity service. There’s scope to do a longer version of this route taking the Norway in a Nutshell tour, which includes the Flåm Railway – possibly the world’s most scenic branch line – and a boat journey through Nærøyfjord and Aurlandsfjord. These cities are linked by a fast train, but there’s a leisurely route south through France to the Pyrenees via Limoges, Toulouse and through magnificent rural and mountain scenery to Latour-de-Carol. While it’s possible to reach Latour-de-Carol by direct night train from Paris, you would miss the slowly unfolding views you can enjoy when doing this journey in daylight. From Latour-de-Carol a commuter line runs all the way to Barcelona and takes just over three hours. Possible stops along the way include fortified Ribes de Freser and Ripoll, home to an ancient monastery and a good starting point for hiking trails. During the summer there’s a tempting night service between Hungary’s capital and the Adriatic. In recent years the train has left Budapest at midnight, getting into Split after lunch. En route it passes the Hungarian holiday playground of Lake Balaton and Zagreb, Croatia’s capital. Once on the Adriatic coast, buses head south to Dubrovnik, while ferries and catamarans radiate out to nearby islands. Pretty much any journey in Switzerland promises jaw-dropping scenery, and on several routes trains run slowly specifically to show off the mountains, rivers and lakes that can be seen from the window. Travelling between Locarno in Switzerland to Domodossola in the Piedmont region of Italy, the Centovalli (Hundred Valleys) Railway is a short but scenic service past 52km of waterfalls, chestnut groves, church-topped villages, deep ravines and vineyards. Highlights include the Isorno Bridge near the village of Intragna and Intragna’s gorge. These routes, plus tips on rail travel, are featured in Lonely Planet’s Guide to Train Travel in Europe by Tom Hall, Imogen Hall and Oliver Smith (£19.99), available at shop.lonelyplanet.com",Lifestyle/Travel,"10 of the best train journeys in Europe, chosen by Lonely Planet",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/mar/28/10-of-the-best-train-journeys-in-europe-lonely-planet
3/28/2022,"Q I’ve managed to secure a job as a teacher in Brunei, starting in August, which is very exciting. I’m currently going through the process of getting my house ready to rent out which I will be doing through an agent given the distance and time difference. However, I’m a bit puzzled by the tax side of things and was hoping you could help. I’ve been told by one agent that I will be liable to pay tax as a non-resident landlord, whereas other agents have said this is not the case. I’ve looked online (including through the government’s own advice) and I still don’t feel I’m sure. Please could you advise me on the state of things around tax and any other advice you think I should have before renting for the first time?JS A I hope you’re going to use the first agent you spoke to as s/he is clearly more on the ball than those who told you that you wouldn’t be liable to pay tax as a non-resident landlord. They have clearly missed the part of their training telling them about the non-resident landlord scheme (NRLS). Under UK law, this obliges UK lettings agents to withhold basic-rate tax due on rental income before it is paid to a UK landlord who lives overseas. You are considered a non-resident landlord – and so come under the NRLS – if you live outside the UK for more than six months. If there is no letting agent, the tenant has to withhold the tax, and pay it to HM Revenue and Customs if the rent is more than £100 a week. If you don’t want the letting agent to deduct tax from the rent, you have to send in form NRL1 either online or by post. This is worth doing provided your tax affairs are up to date and you do not expect to be liable for UK tax on your UK-based income. Whether you have your rental income paid before or after tax, you’ll need to fill in a self-assessment tax return as you would if you were a landlord living in the UK. However the rent is paid, it makes sense to have it paid in sterling into a bank account in the UK to avoid currency conversion costs. You also need to make sure that your mortgage lender is happy for you to let your house and check whether your insurers need to make changes to your buildings and contents policies once you have a tenant.",Lifestyle/Money,If I work abroad do I pay tax on rental income from my home in UK?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/28/work-abroad-pay-tax-rental-income-home-uk
3/28/2022,"Domestic & General has left my elderly disabled aunt without a working fridge/freezer for more than two months. When her old model broke in January she called the company that provides it with extended warranty cover. A technician decided that it was irreparable, and said the company would send a new one as per the terms of her policy. When it arrived it had a big dent at the front so the delivery people took it back and were to arrange to deliver another one. We are now in March and she still has not received a replacement. Domestic & General said it was going to give her £100 for the inconvenience and arrange for someone to measure her doorway to see if the new machine will fit. However, this has not happened. We have made a formal complaint but are not getting anywhere. JP, London These policies are a hangover from times when white goods cost the equivalent of several months’ salary and could not easily be replaced. These days, the only reason to pay companies like Domestic & General is to get speedy, hassle-free repairs or a replacement when things go wrong – something the company has clearly failed to deliver in this case. This is not the first letter we have had about this firm. I asked the company to investigate, and it has moved quickly to put matters right. It says: “We design our policies to provide peace of mind so we are disappointed she experienced a delay. We have investigated the issue and have since paid for a new and upgraded fridge/freezer model. We have also provided compensation for the inconvenience.” On its website this week, Domestic & General quoted more than £70 a year to cover a two-year-old fridge worth £300.

3/28/2022,"Behind closed doors in a nondescript conference room at the foot of Capitol Hill, the House select committee investigating 6 January next week expects to hear testimony about the connections between the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys militia groups and the Capitol attack. The panel expects to hear how the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys coordinated their plans and movements in the days before the insurrection to the same level of detail secured by the justice department and referenced in recent prosecutions for seditious conspiracy. And the select committee hopes to also hear in the 5 April deposition – arranged by a senior counsel for the panel – private conversations between the leaders of the two militia groups and whether they might have communicated with any Trump advisers. The panel should get the evidence both on the record and under oath, according to two sources familiar with the arrangement, to add to raw video footage of a meeting between the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys leaders in a garage across from the Capitol on the eve of 6 January. The expected testimony and materials represent another significant breakthrough for the investigation and could play a major role in establishing for the select committee whether Donald Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy as part of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Most crucially for the panel, it could form part of the evidence to connect the militia groups that stormed the Capitol on 6 January to the organizers of the Save America rally that immediately preceded the attack – who in turn are slowly being linked to the Trump White House. As the select committee moves closer to Trump – who House investigators alleged in a recent court filing that the former president violated federal laws including obstructing Congress and conspiring to defraud the United States as he sought to return himself to power – it is redoubling its efforts. The information that Sean Tonolli, the senior investigative counsel who set up the deposition, should obtain about the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys in the first week of April means the panel has managed to get all the major evidence for all the big moments. In December, the select committee revealed that it had in its possession 2,320 text messages from Trump’s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, emails such as one with a PowerPoint presentation on staging a coup, and other documents he had turned over to the inquiry. That alone has been seen as a treasure trove of materials, including messages to and from House Republicans who apologized for not being able to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election win, and more recently, messages with Ginni Thomas, the wife of supreme court justice Clarence Thomas. In January, the panel got from the National Archives thousands of pages of Trump White House documents that the former president unsuccessfully sought to shield over claims of executive privilege in a case that Justice Thomas reviewed and emerged as the sole dissenter. Those included documents in the files of Meadows and former deputy White House counsel Pat Philbin, among others, and Trump’s private schedule for 6 January that showed he gave the crowd a false pretense to go to the Capitol perhaps in the hope that they might stop Biden’s certification. Then the select committee learned of the fake electors ploy – a scheme to send “alternate” slates of Trump electors to Congress in states won by Biden – that ensnared the White House and showed the involvement of some of Trump’s most senior aides. Earlier this month, the panel also revealed in separate litigation that Trump lawyer John Eastman knew that his plan to have then-vice president Mike Pence reject Biden’s wins in select battleground states and return Trump to office was an unlawful violation of the Electoral Count Act. The panel has so far conducted the vast majority of its investigation in private, conducting nearly 750 depositions behind closed doors, amassing more than 84,000 documents and pursuing more than 430 tips that have come through on its website tip line. But notwithstanding the secrecy, the select committee has uncovered extraordinary information that have put them several steps closer to potentially forcing them to make criminal referrals to the justice department once the inquiry is complete, the sources said. What the panel has found and made public so far, the sources said, could also lay the groundwork to sketch out a criminal conspiracy that connects Trump’s political plan to return himself to office with the attack itself – its ultimate suspicion, the Guardian first reported. From its nondescript offices boarded up with beige boards and wood-paneled conference rooms with blinds always drawn, the select committee has spent the last eight months working in color-coded teams in an attempt to untangle Trump’s efforts to subvert the 2020 election results. The gold team is examining Trump’s plans to stop the certification of Biden’s election win with the help of Republican members of Congress, and his pressure campaign on state, local and justice department officials to return himself to office. The red team is looking at the Save America rally organizers and the Stop the Steal Movement, while the purple team is scrutinizing the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys, the 1st Amendment Praetorian and how militia groups helped lead the Trump mob into the Capitol building. As the panel moves into the second phase of its investigation, its members have said they want to release in narrative form the evidence of wrongdoing in a series of public hearings that are likely to be delayed from April to May but still focus on how Trump broke the law. The select committee’s purpose remains to recommend legislative reforms to prevent a repeat of 6 January, but the evidence collected by the panel is fast hurtling it towards a conclusion of criminal behavior that could implicate Trump – and necessitate a referral – the sources said.",News/US news,Capitol attack panel expects to hear how militia groups coordinated plans before insurrection,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/capitol-attack-panel-militia-groups-oath-keepers-proud-boys
3/28/2022,"The latest high-end smartphone from China’s Oppo aims to usurp Samsung as the best Android phone launched in 2022 with serious speed and a luxurious ceramic back that’s almost too smooth. The Find X5 Pro costs £1,049 and won’t be sold in the US. It replaces last year’s Find X3 Pro (there was no X4) and is packed with all the things you expect from a top-flight phone. The 120Hz 6.7in OLED screen is slick, crisp, bright and colourful, although is too saturated in the default “vibrant” display colour mode. Setting it to one of the more natural colour options looked better to my eye. The back of the phone is more unusual, with a moulded design that fully envelops the camera lump in a single piece of smooth ceramic material. In its glossy black colour it certainly looks and feels premium, but it is so smooth that the phone slides off anything that isn’t level, including my desk or the sofa, forcing the need for a case. It feels very solidly made and nice in the hand, with a relatively narrow width that makes it easier to use than some larger rivals, but it is a touch heavy compared with similar-sized models from Samsung and others. Screen: 6.7in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (525ppi) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 RAM: 12GB of RAM Storage: 256GB Operating system: ColorOS 12.1 (Android 12) Camera: 50MP main and ultrawide + 13MP 2x telephoto, 32MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.2 and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes) Dimensions: 163.7 x 73.9 x 8.5mm Weight: 218g The Find has the same top Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip as most high-end Android phones launched in 2022, performing admirably with a rapid interface and smooth gaming. It does, however, get noticeably warm during even fairly short gaming sessions. Battery life is very good, lasting more than 42 hours between charges on average used on 5G for three hours and with the screen set to the default FHD+ resolution and actively used for almost six hours with various apps and Chrome. That’s about seven hours longer than Samsung’s nearest rival and about the same as Apple’s iPhone 13 Pro, meaning you will probably only have to charge it every other night with light usage. It lasts for about five hours of screen-on time when the display is increased its maximum QHD+ resolution. Oppo rates the battery for at least 1,600 full charge cycles using its 80W SuperVOOC system while maintaining at least 80% of its original capacity, which is at least twice as long as most others. The phone is generally repairable by Oppo with a replacement battery costing about £30 plus labour. The company operates a trade-in scheme and publishes yearly sustainability reports, but not for individual products. The Find X5 Pro does not include recycled materials. Oppo’s ColorOS is a heavily customised version of Android 12 with a design more familiar in Asia than most of the Android phones sold in the west. The majority of the system should be familiar to anyone who has used an Android device, however, and is packed with customisation options for its look and operation. It contains some small oddities and irritations, including quick launching of the camera requiring a double-press of the volume button instead of the power button, which is common in China but it doesn’t work when playing music. To turn off the phone you have to hold both the volume up and power button for a couple of seconds, too, which doesn’t work reliably, often shooting the volume to maximum instead. Oppo will support the Find X5 Pro with software updates including three major Android version upgrades and a total four years of security updates from the phone’s release. That is a significant improvement over last year’s model but lags behind Samsung’s five and Apple’s six-plus years of support. New for this year is a partnership with camera-maker Hasselblad matching Oppo’s subsidiary OnePlus’s from last year. The Find has three cameras on the back and a 32MP selfie camera on the front, the latter of which is solid but unremarkable. The main 50MP camera generally shoots very good images with excellent detail, handling a range of lighting conditions well, including very low light, with aplomb. It would occasionally oversaturate some colours in an image, as if it had pre-applied a filter, but otherwise did great job. The 50MP ultra wide camera can be good but often produced images that looked washed out. The 13MP 2x telephoto camera is fine for what it is, but is obviously inferior to the two other cameras and miles behind the competition at this price, which often have 3, 5 or even 10x optical zooms getting you meaningfully closer to your subject. The phone also shoots good video in up to 8K resolution, with excellent stabilisation in 1080p modes. Overall, the main camera is really good, but the ultra wide and weak zoom let the Find down compared with similarly priced or cheaper rivals. The Oppo Find X5 Pro costs £1,049 in black or white. For comparison, the Google Pixel 6 Pro costs £849, the Samsung Galaxy S21+ costs £949, the Galaxy S21 Ultra costs £1,149 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max costs £1,049. The Oppo Find X5 Pro is a nice-looking, slick Android phone. It has many of the high-end features you should expect, including Android’s top chip from Qualcomm, good battery life, a great screen, unusual back design and incredibly fast charging. Its main camera on the back is very good, but the phone is let down a little by its ultra-wide camera and its 2x telephoto camera is particularly weak compared with the competition. The ColorOS software is improving, now with four years of support, but it still has lots of little niggles. The biggest problem is the phone’s £1,049 RRP is simply too high for what it offers. When premium rivals offer more capable 4x zoom cameras for less or mega zoom cameras for a little more, five or more years of software support and similar or better screens and designs, Oppo still has much work to do to justify its very high asking price. Pros: good screen, top performance, long battery life, very fast charging, interesting design, good main camera, water resistance, fast in-screen fingerprint scanner. Cons: expensive, ultrawide camera is inconsistent, lack of extended optical zoom for the camera is poor, only four years of software support guaranteed, ColorOS not polished enough, design marred by ugly logos, back is too smooth and slides around on not-quite-flat surfaces.

3/28/2022,"Australia has lost influence in the Pacific by failing to act on climate and cutting foreign aid, Anthony Albanese says, amid concerns about China’s proposed security deal with Solomon Islands. Australia and New Zealand are worried the draft agreement could jeopardise regional stability, with China having the opportunity to base navy warships in the Pacific less than 2,000km off the Australian coast. The prime minister of Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, is due to address parliament in Honiara on Tuesday about security cooperation with China. But the leaking of the draft deal has prompted soul-searching about gaps in Australia’s Pacific step-up. Australia’s official development assistance to Solomon Islands declined 12.6% from $179m in 2014-15 to $156m in the 2021-22 budget, government figures showed. On Monday, Albanese stopped short of committing to increasing foreign aid if elected, saying Thursday’s budget reply speech was “not an alternative budget”. He said he looked forward to “putting forward an alternative budget if we’re successful”. The Labor leader – whose party remains ahead of the Coalition in opinion polls with an election due in May – blamed several factors for Australia’s difficulties maintaining influence in the Pacific. “It is about our level of aid, but it’s about much more than that as well,” Albanese said in Canberra. “If you go to the Pacific, if you meet with leaders in the Pacific, the first thing they raise with you is not aid, it is climate change.” Albanese – who has pledged to cut emissions by 43% by 2030 on 2005 levels, compared with the Coalition’s 26% to 28% target – said Australia would only have a strong position in the Pacific by being “good neighbours”. “Whilst Australia sits in the naughty corner, at international conferences such as Glasgow, with a prime minister giving an empty speech to an empty room with no increase in ambition for 2030, then we continue to alienate our friends in the Pacific,” he said. Albanese addressed reporters after being briefed by Australia’s national security agencies about developments in Solomon Islands and Ukraine. He said Australia had historically “punched way above our weight, but we have lost some paint over the last decade, just as we did by our refusal to sign up to [the] Kyoto [Protocol] under the Howard government”. “One of the ways in which we counter what is going on, which is strategic competition in our region, is by being taken seriously as leaders in our region on climate,” he said. “And we’re not doing that at the moment. We’re not.” Albanese said he was not arguing that major-emitter China had a strong climate record, but merely that Australia could increase its influence in the region by having a more ambitious policy. His comments were in line with an argument mounted by Peter Hooton, a former Australian high commissioner to Samoa and Solomon Islands. Hooton said in a piece for the Lowy Institute’s The Interpreter that only “concrete and ambitious commitments” on climate would “rebuild and sustain Pacific island countries’ trust in Australia as their key partner, friend and ally”. “Australia’s refusal to take domestic measures to limit emissions and its resistance to international efforts to strengthen emissions reduction commitments have reduced the country’s leverage in the region and made it harder to protect its permanent, and vitally important, economic and geostrategic interests there in the face of competition, most obviously from China,” Hooton said. While the proposed security deal still needs to go through the Pacific nation’s cabinet, the Solomon Islands government confirmed on Friday it was seeking to “broaden its security and development cooperation with more countries”, referring to Australia and China as its “two major partners”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said on Monday the proposed security agreement was “gravely concerning”. In an interview with RNZ, Ardern was asked whether it would ever be acceptable to New Zealand for China to station military vessels in Solomon Islands. “We see such acts as the potential militarisation of the region and also see very little reason in terms of the Pacific security for such a need and such a presence,” she said. Ardern said New Zealand had been in contact with Solomon Islands at the leader level “at the end of last year” to express “concern over the direction of travel that Solomons was taking in terms of their security arrangements with China”. “We have to make sure that we are respecting the sovereignty of our neighbours whilst working closely alongside them to make sure our region’s needs are met and we don’t see the need for anyone to consider, for instance, new military arrangements,” she said. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he had been in contact with Ardern over the weekend and he would speak with his counterparts from Papua New Guinea and Fiji on Monday. “The reports we have seen are not a surprise to us and are a reminder of constant pressures and threats that present in our region to our own national security,” Morrison said. The opposition leader of Solomon Islands, Matthew Wale, told the Australian newspaper he had informed the Australian high commissioner “as far back as August last year” of discussions with Beijing about closer security arrangements. In November, Australia sent more than 100 police and defence force personnel to Solomon Islands to help quell unrest, but found itself in competition with China which also agreed to send police. Australia’s deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, denied the government had “dropped the ball” in its relationship with Pacific nations. “I think it would be highly naive to think that the Australian government is not completely all over this issue,” Joyce said. “The prime minister, the national security committee, they’re not fools.” In a reference to China, Joyce said Australia was “not blind to the tactics of other people who are going through the process of trying to restrict our capacity of movement and intimidate us”.",News/Australia news,"Australia’s lost influence in Pacific on display in Solomon Islands-China deal, Anthony Albanese says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/australias-lost-influence-in-pacific-on-display-in-solomon-islands-china-deal-anthony-albanese-says
3/28/2022,"It was a historic night for women in film. Jane Campion, the revered New Zealand-born Australian director, became the third female film-maker ever and the second in a row to win best director in the 94-year history of the Academy Awards. Director Sian Heder won the night’s top gong, taking home best picture and best adapted screenplay, for Coda – just her second feature-length film and the first win for Apple. And earlier in the night, Ariana DeBose became the first queer woman of colour to win best supporting actress. At just 20, Billie Eilish won for best original song, and costume designer Jenny Beavan picked up her third Oscar for her work on Cruella. But in the end a night of momentous achievements was overshadowed by an act of violence between two men. OK yes Will Smith slapped Chris Rock BUT JANE CAMPION JUST WON! Questlove just won a fucking Oscar for an incredible, invaluable piece of cultural reclamation. Jane Campion finally won her Oscar. Troy Kotsur and Ariana DeBose made history. And no one is going to be talking about any of these things tomorrow. The mood in Hollywood’s Dolby theatre was muted and shocked after actor Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock on stage, after Rock compared Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, who is bald and has alopecia, to GI Jane. “Wow, Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me,” Rock said, as Smith returned to his seat. Smith then yelled: “Keep my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth!” Smith later apologised to the Academy, but not to Rock. Some attempted to refocus attention on other moments in the three-hour ceremony. The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, sent her congratulations to Campion, saying: “Thank you for once again putting New Zealand on the world stage, displaying just how beautiful our country is with her talent, her skills and her storytelling. It’s a phenomenal outcome and I know we’re all very proud of her.” “Let’s take a moment from talking about men not being able to control their rage – because that happens all the time,” one Twitter user said. “What doesn’t happen all the time? Women being nominated, much less winning, Best Director. Congratulations Jane Campion.” “Jane Campion thrilled she’s no longer the first result when you Google ‘Oscars Serena Williams scandal’,” said another Twitter user, referring to Campion’s Bafta speech that saw her accused of diminishing the achievements of the Williams sisters. Campion later apologised for her “thoughtless comment”. Campion had already made Oscars history by becoming the first female director to be nominated twice in the category, having been previously nominated in 1994 for The Piano. She did not win in 1994, but did take home best original screenplay and was the first female film-maker to receive the Palme d’Or at Cannes. With nominations in 12 categories, The Power of the Dog had started out as the 2022 Academy Awards’ frontrunner. However, it slunk home with just one. Campion now joins Kathryn Bigelow and last year’s winner Chloé Zhao as the only female winners of the best director category.",Arts/Film,Oscars 2022: a historic night for women – overshadowed by male violence,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/oscars-2022-a-historic-night-for-women-overshadowed-by-male-violence
3/28/2022,"A quick summary of all the Victorian news you need to know on Monday 28 March. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has tested positive to Covid and will isolate for the next seven days. The deputy premier, James Merlino, will take over as acting premier until next Monday. I woke up today with some symptoms and did a RAT before heading to the office. It was positive.Cath and the kids are negative, but as close contacts will isolate with me for seven days. pic.twitter.com/V2d3RUjvOE In a statement, Andrews said he took a rapid antigen test after developing “mild symptoms”. “After developing mild symptoms this morning including a sore throat and mild temperature, I undertook a rapid antigen test,” Andrews said. “I have tested positive to Covid-19 and will now isolate for the next seven days. “So far, Cath and the kids have tested negative. As they are close contacts, they will also isolate for the next seven days.” The positive test result means Andrews will be unable to attend Wednesday’s state memorial for cricketer Shane Warne. Melbourne’s air quality could become “very poor” on Monday due to prescribed burns happening, according the Environmental Protection Agency. Air quality forecast update. Fair to Very Poor air quality is expected today in Melbourne and Central regions. Smoke is drifting from planned burns to the east. Other regions can expect Good to Fair air quality. Visit #AirWatch to see your region: https://t.co/uDkpNZxibR pic.twitter.com/i7YbCIoq7X “Fair to very poor air quality is expected today in Melbourne and central regions,” the EPA said in a forecast. “Smoke is drifting from planned burns to the east. Some wind-blown dust [is] possible closer to industrial and construction sites.” According to the EPA, “very poor” air quality means that people should avoid physical activity outdoors if they develop a cough or shortness of breath, and close windows and doors. In Mooroolbark, in Melbourne’s north-east, “extremely poor” air quality was briefly detected between 10am and 11am Monday. The Morrison government has announced that Tuesday’s federal budget will include $3.1bn to support two freight terminals in outer Melbourne. This includes $1.2bn for a terminal in Beveridge, north of Melbourne, as well as $280m to improve roads to the site. Another $740m will be included for a terminal in Truganina, in Melbourne’s west, along with $920m for a rail connection to the site. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the $3.3bn to be spent on transport projects across the state would support “more than 6,500 direct and indirect jobs”. “Continuing to provide record future funding for road and rail projects is a key part of our economic plan for the long term to keep our economy strong,” Morrison said. However, the Victorian transport infrastructure minister, Jacinta Allan, said $2bn of that funding commitment had previously been announced and “has been sitting around for a full year” without being spent. “It’s a timely reminder for Victorians that of that $3.3bn, two-thirds of that money was announced last year,” Allan said. Victoria recorded 8,739 new Covid cases and no deaths on Monday. For the fourth consecutive day, the number of new infections recorded across the state were below 10,000. The number of Covid patients in Victorian hospitals has fallen to 252. Of those, 21 people are in ICU. As reported by Benita Kolovos earlier on Monday, a new report commissioned by the Victorian government has found women in the gig economy earn up to 37% less than men. The report, produced by a Queensland University of Technology research team and released on Monday, summarises Australian and global studies and found the gig economy can “both reproduce and exacerbate existing gender inequalities in work”. According to the report, women in gig economy roles in Australia earn between 10% and 37% less than men. For the same work, men earned on average $2.67 an hour more than women, though about 40% of gig economy workers do not know what their hourly rate is.",News/Australia news,"Victoria daily news update: premier catches Covid, smoke in the city and money for freight terminals",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/victorian-daily-news-update-premier-catches-covid-smoke-in-the-city-and-money-for-freight-terminals
3/28/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today. Representatives from Russia and Ukraine will meet this week for a new round of talks aimed at ending the war, with Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying he hoped they would bring peace “without delay”. The new talks are set to start in Turkey on either Monday or Tuesday. Zelenskiy is desperate to halt the bombardment of cities such as Mariupol, where officials said the situation was “catastrophic”. He also said he could make compromises about the status of the eastern Donbas region but said any agreement would have to be guaranteed by third parties and put to a referendum. It comes after Ukrainian intelligence said Putin has been forced to rethink his strategy after failing to take Kyiv in the early days of the war, and that he now aims to split Ukraine into two, emulating the postwar division between North and South Korea. Joe Biden has said that he was not calling for regime change in Russia when he said that Putin “cannot remain in power” as the White House continued its efforts to talk down the weekend gaffe. When asked by a reporter in yesterday if he wanted to see the Russian president removed from office, the US president said “no”. French president Emmanuel Macron called for restraint in both words and actions in dealing with the Ukraine conflict. A unit of 30 Ukrainian special forces troops using quad bikes and drones played a large part in halting the massive Russian armoured convoy that threatened Kyiv in the first weeks of the war. The commuter town of Irpin near Kyiv has been under bombardment for weeks and some of the last residents to escape tell a story of constant noise, near misses and unbearable conditions. You can follow all the developments at our live blog, and catch up on what we know so far on day 33. The slap – The annual Hollywood backslapping fest that is the Oscars was thrown into chaos last night when Will Smith strode on to the stage at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles and slapped Chris Rock in the face after the comic made a joke about Smith’s wife. On stage to present the award for best documentary, Rock cracked a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith being lined up to star in GI Jane 2 – seemingly a reference to her shaved head. (Pinkett Smith suffers from alopecia, a condition that causes hair loss.) Her husband was enraged by the gag and rushed the stage and struck Rock in front of a horrified audience. He then twice told Rock to “Keep my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth”. In the pandemonium that followed, Smith was awarded best actor for King Richard and broke down in tears as he accepted his statuette while apologising to for “doing crazy things”. Elsewhere, Kenneth Branagh won his first Oscar for best screenplay for Belfast, Jane Campion won best director for The Power of the Dog, and Jessica Chastain won best actress for The Eyes of Tammy Faye. The event’s hosts – Amy Schumer, Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall – made jokes about race, sexism and Hollywood in their opening segment, although it seemed tame compared with what followed. And here’s the all-important red carpet gallery. School shake-up – Changes to the school system in England to be unveiled in a white paper today will allow councils to establish their own academy trusts and give schools the opportunity to leave failing ones. A target date of 2030 will be set for converting council-maintained schools into academies and for them to have joined or be preparing to join a multi-academy trust (Mat). The plans also include a “parent pledge” for families to request additional support for their children, but that has been dismissed as a “gimmick” by school leaders. A survey reveals that a majority of adults think childhoods have got worse in the UK amid Covid, mental health issues and poverty. China surge – Shanghai is entering a phased lockdown to curb an Omicron-fuelled Covid-19 outbreak that has hit China with its highest caseloads since the early days of the pandemic. China’s biggest city, which has a population of 25 million, will lock down its eastern half from today until Friday, when it will be the turn of the western side. The ongoing outbreak in Hong Kong has seen an influx of doctors from the Chinese mainland and workers to build hospitals as Beijing tightens its grip on the city. In the UK, less than half of the severely immunosuppressed adults in England have had their Covid booster, with levels of uptake differing dramatically across ethnicities. Mental health deaths – An inquiry into the deaths of 1,500 people while being cared for as patients of NHS mental health services in Essex has found evidence of “dispassionate” mistreatment. The deaths were “unexpected, unexplained or self-inflicted” between 2000 and 2020 and occurred while they were receiving treatment from NHS mental health trusts that for years had faced persistent complaints of providing poor care. The initial findings of an inquiry by Geraldine Strathdee have revealed “unimaginable pain and heartache” for the families. Royal crisis – The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have insisted they are interested only in a “better future” for the Commonwealth, not in who leads it, as they ended their controversial tour of the Caribbean. The royal couple’s visit was punctuated by calls for slavery reparations and fury over the Windrush scanda and Prince William reportedly called an emergency summit with his most senior aides this week to discuss where it leaves the monarchy. One of the largest mining operations ever seen on Earth aims to despoil an ocean we are only just beginning to understand, global environment editor Jonathan Watts says.

With speculation about his future as England captain at fever pitch after England slumped to defeat against West Indies in Grenada to confirm another lost series, Joe Root has recommitted himself to the role. Lewis Hamilton and other F1 drivers have made it clear they still have serious misgivings about racing in Saudi Arabia, after Red Bull’s Max Verstappen finally vanquished Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc in Sunday’s race. Plans that would enable football clubs to qualify for the Champions League based on historic performance and not their league position are back on the table, a year after the collapse of the European Super League. Gareth Southgate says it would be “hugely unfortunate” if Harry Kane was to break the England goalscoring record in a match where supporters were banned. Goals from lifelong fans Alessia Russo and Katie Zelem helped Manchester United to come from behind and defeat Everton 3-1 in front of a club‑record crowd of 20,241 at Old Trafford for a Women’s Super League match. Biniam Girmay became the first rider from Eritrea to win a cycling World Tour (elite) race when he prevailed in the Ghent-Wevelgem classic. And Cameron Norrie overcame a late wobble to defeat Hugo Gaston and move into the fourth round of the Miami Open, as Andy Murray, Dan Evans and Heather Watson all fell on Saturday. Major investors led by Legal & General Investment Management have launched a campaign calling for Sainsbury’s to help tackle the cost of living crisis by becoming the first supermarket group to pay all its workers the “real living wage” of £9.90 an hour. The spread of lockdowns in China has put the skids under Asian markets today and the FTSE100 is set to shed around one quarter of a percentage point this morning. The pound is on $1.315 and €1.200. The tabloids mostly lead on the royal tour debacle with the Sun splash saying “fresh prince”, in reference to William’s planned modernisation of the firm. “A battle of Wills” says the Mirror, while the Mail’s lead is Mail “William: I’ll end royal era of ‘never explain’”. “Putin wants to split Ukraine in two like Korea, warns Kyiv”, reads the Guardian’s main headline, while the Times also opts for that line with “Putin wants to divide Ukraine, West warned”. The i says “Russia is ‘trying to split Ukraine in two’”. The FT reports on the backlash over Biden’s weekend gaffe with “Blinken softens Biden remarks by saying US has no aim to oust Putin”, as does the Telegraph – “Backlash at Biden for ‘Putin must go’ comment” – and the Scotsman “West rolls back on Biden call for regime change in Russia”. The Daily Record says “3 million face debt timebomb” and the Express also leads on the cost of living crisis: “New council tax cut on way for millions”.

3/28/2022,"It was the bombshell moment of the Oscars. Not feel-good best picture winner Coda, or historic wins for Afro-Latina actor Ariana DeBose or deaf actor Troy Kotsur, or the Academy hiring not one but three hosts – Amy Schumer, Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall – for the first time since 2018. No, by far the most talked-about moment of the 94th annual Academy Awards was when the best actor winner, Will Smith, took offense to joke by presenter Chris Rock and slapped him onstage. Rock had joked about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett-Smith, as being ready for “GI Jane 2” – seemingly a reference to her shaved head. (Pinkett-Smith has been open about having alopecia, which causes hair loss.) Smith then walked to the stage, slapped Rock, and sat back down, before shouting “keep my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth” twice. Reactions online, of course, ranged from delighted memes to concern. Some supported Smith, including the actor’s 23-year-old son Jaden Smith, who wrote on Twitter minutes after the ceremony: “And That’s How We Do It.” Representative Ayanna Pressley, who has also been open about stigma faced with alopecia, tweeted and deleted a defense of Smith. “#Alopecia nation stand up! Thank you #WillSmith Shout out to all the husbands who defend their wives living with alopecia in the face of daily ignorance & insults,” the deleted tweet read. Some, including Conan O’Brien and Abbott Elementary star Quinta Brunson, revelled in the messiness: While others in Hollywood simply gaped: Or, as actor LaKeith Stanfield put it in an interview on the red carpet for the Vanity Fair Oscar party: “I don’t know, it was crazy. I don’t know, it was surreal.” Some were appalled by Smith’s behaviour, seeing it as an example of the normalization of violence. “Violence isn’t ok. Assault is never the answer,” tweeted actor Sophia Bush. “Also? This is the 2nd time that Chris has made fun of Jada on the #Oscars stage, & tonight he went after her alopecia. Punching down at someone’s auto-immune disease is wrong. Doing so on purpose is cruel. They both need a breather.” “Let me tell you something, it’s a very bad practice to walk up on stage and physically assault a Comedian,” tweeted comedian Kathy Griffin. “Now we all have to worry about who wants to be the next Will Smith in comedy clubs and theaters.” “Someone in the audience charged the stage Friday night during my opener’s set and attempted to throw the speaker, started taking swings at the people trying to stop her and pushed down a security guard. It’s scary times. So, no, I don’t find someone getting hit on stage amusing,” tweeted comedian Fortune Feimster. “The ‘vessels of love’ I have known or admired never acted violently against another human being…” tweeted the actor Cary Elwes, referring to Smith’s acceptance speech for best actor, in which he said he felt called to be a “vessel of love”. One official body to weigh in was the Los Angeles police department (LAPD), which released the following statement: “LAPD investigative entities are aware of an incident between two individuals during the Academy Awards program. The incident involved one individual slapping another. The individual involved has declined to file a police report. “If the involved party desires a police report at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report.”",Arts/Film,‘Violence isn’t OK’: Hollywood reacts to Will Smith slapping Chris Rock,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/will-smith-slap-how-did-hollywood-celebrities-react
