5/15/2022,"Emma Hayes has described the Chelsea captain, Magda Eriksson, as “a main reason we’ve been a winning team for years” and praised her influence on her return from three months out to help navigate Chelsea to a third consecutive league title and Sunday’s FA Cup final against Manchester City. Eriksson suffered an ankle injury during Chelsea’s 4-0 Champions League defeat to Wolfsburg in December, ruling her out of action for a significant part of the season. “We knew it was an injury that was going to take a bit of time,” says Hayes. “Naturally, the team was going to lose something. In Aniek [Nouwen] we have a player that doesn’t have the experience but stepped into a space that helped develop the team in some different ways. However, Magda’s our captain for a reason.” When Eriksson was fit again in March Hayes was reluctant to put her straight back into a team on a winning streak, despite her quality. “I really rate and respect Magda but we had conversations around being patient and I knew that moment would come. Neither of us thought that would be when we went down to 10 players at Tottenham. “Having Magda’s leadership back on the pitch, and I don’t want to take anything away from Millie [Bright] because Millie’s been amazing, but having both of them together brings another dimension to us managing really tough moments. Particularly when the stress levels go up.” Being out was “a challenge”, says Eriksson. “It was my first long injury in a very long time. It wasn’t nice to be out for three months and not be part of the team. “But watching the team play and watching players grow in that period, every single player stepped up so that made me really proud. I was sad not to be part of it but it made me really proud to see how many younger girls in our team stepped up and really took that responsibility.” Coming back into the Chelsea side was a test. “You want to be back where you left off but you have to respect that your body has gone through an injury and you have been out for three months. I have really high demands, so I had to try and be nice to myself.” Being captain from the sidelines was a different role for the Sweden centre-back. “It’s important to know when to take a step back and when to let the team figure it out themselves with their new roles,” she says. “Millie had the armband and she did amazingly and the team performed really well. So I tried to mainly focus on my injury, getting myself right first, because that is important, you have to focus on yourself sometimes. But then I was always there if anyone needed a chat or anyone wanted to talk to someone who wasn’t maybe involved in playing that much.” Eriksson’s absence was keenly felt for Chelsea in their 3-1 Continental League Cup final defeat to their FA Cup final opponents, Manchester City. “They’re back now, they’re back to their old self,” says Eriksson, who is in touch with the Chelsea men’s team captain, César Azpilicueta, and said the two Chelsea teams would be cheering each other on.

They were strong against us as well in the Conti Cup final, we want to get revenge for that game. We know we can do better than that.” The FA Cup final in 2018 was Eriksson’s “first real big game for Chelsea” and the competition means a lot. “That’s the game I will always remember, it’s one of the coolest I’ve ever experienced. I don’t know how many were in the stands, but it was a lot of people and back then I wasn’t used to playing in front of that many people and we’re expecting an even bigger crowd on Sunday. The fans are amazing, and the history of the Cup is great. There’s so many things that make you want to win it.”",Sport/Sport,Eriksson targets revenge in Chelsea’s final showdown with Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/14/magda-eriksson-targets-revenge-in-chelseas-final-showdown-with-manchester-city
5/15/2022,"“The person in this position, when things don’t go well, always gets blamed,” says the Leeds manager, Jesse Marsch. The club have two games to save their Premier League status, not because Marsch has failed since taking over in February but because of a collection of errors that has left them in a perilous position. Marsch finds his side in 18th place heading into Brighton’s visit on Sunday for a game Leeds will see as their best chance to secure maximum points. Unfortunately for Leeds, Brighton have lost once – a 3-0 defeat away to Manchester City – in their past seven games. They have beaten Arsenal and Tottenham away in that period, so will not fear a trip to Yorkshire. If you speak to those who know Marsch best, they talk of a highly intelligent man, someone who can change the narrative and outsmart opposition managers. The focus since his arrival 10 games ago has been on his words rather than actions. Marsch is constantly analysing his own performance and that of his team to find improvements. Leeds have been reduced to 10 men in the first half of their past two games, leaving Marsch to wonder if he is overstimulating his players. “The key for me is to understand what I’ve learned in this business, what this particular team in this situation and these particular players need and how do I best provide that for them so that they can be all that I believe they can be,” he says. “That’s what the project is from a mentality perspective. Then there is applying the football tactics and style of play so that they understand what their roles are on the pitch.” Marsch has been hamstrung by those available to him. Leeds failed to make a signing in January. When battling relegation, improving a struggling squad seems a prerequisite, especially since Marcelo Bielsa was sacked less than a month after the window closed. “All I knew when I stepped into this situation was that I was getting into the fire,” Marsch says. “All I tried to do was learn as quickly as possible how to help the group in that moment to transmit a positive way to give us the best chance in these last two matches to have a chance.” Bielsa was given the chance to sign players in January but was not interested in those put forward, instead wanting to stick with the small squad he knew. Bielsa is a man of conviction and always thought there was enough quality to get them out of danger. Bielsa was not wrong; there is a Premier League standard team at Leeds but not a squad that can cope with the rigours of it, something that can also be said of relegation rivals Burnley, who are level on points with a game in hand but with a much superior goal difference. Patrick Bamford has made nine Premier League appearances all season, Stuart Dallas is out with a broken leg, Liam Cooper and Kalvin Phillips have had lengthy spells on the sidelines. The lack of depth has ensured the absence of the team’s spine has caused major problems. Missing key players from back to front can explain Leeds’s defensive problem that can be summed up in the stats: 77 goals conceded in 36 games. The players have looked tired in recent times; it is hard to reinvigorate a squad that spent three and a half years working under Bielsa’s intense methods. The injury list could just be a coincidence but when pushed to your physical maximum for so long, it can have a toll on the body. The lack of options available to Marsch were laid bare against Chelsea on Wednesday. Lewis Bate made his full Premier League debut in midfield, while their biggest attacking threat, Raphinha, played as a right wing-back. Of the six unused substitutes, including 16-year-old Archie Gray, only Jamie Shackleton and Charlie Cresswell had made a league start. They will be without Luke Ayling and Dan James on Sunday after their red cards. Marsch hopes the home crowd will inspire his team but believes the reckless challenges can partially be blamed on the players’ desire to show much they care. “It’s because they want to do whatever they can for the fans,” he says. Marsch has been frustrated by the coverage of his use of quotes from Mother Teresa and Mahatma Gandhi among others to inspire his players. He sees it as part of a bigger picture but Leeds’s long-term view can go no further than the final-day away game at Brentford. The club’s ownership group spoke to the players on Thursday in their own attempt to motivate them. It looks to be a straight shootout between Leeds and Burnley for the final relegation spot. If Marsch feels the need to provide more inspirational quotes to his players, then he should look no further than Leeds’s greatest manager, Don Revie, to remind them: “You get nowt for being second”.",Sport/Football,‘I knew I was getting into the fire’: Jesse Marsch battles to keep Leeds up,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/14/i-knew-i-was-getting-into-the-fire-jesse-marsch-on-the-battle-to-keep-leeds-up
5/15/2022,"Boris Johnson will vow not to scrap the Brexit deal governing Northern Ireland and instead back reform that has “the broadest possible cross-community support”, in an attempt to cool tensions over the issue. In a shift in tone before emergency talks in Belfast on Monday, the prime minister will make it clear that he has no intention of scrapping the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, which he claims is causing significant disruption to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Officials said that Johnson was intending to deliver a “tough message” to the leaders of Northern Ireland’s parties. He will plead with them to “get back to work”, after the Democratic Unionists blocked the election of a speaker at the Stormont Assembly on Friday. The move means the assembly is unable to function. DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said that his party’s move was a protest at the impact that the protocol was having on trade crossing the Irish Sea. Such goods have a series of checks that have placed a de facto trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In an attempt to push the DUP into re-engaging, Johnson will say that any action by his government to alter the protocol must lead to all parties coming together to form an executive and assembly. But after threats by foreign secretary Liz Truss to override large parts of the protocol, the PM is expected to strike a less strident tone. Johnson will tell Northern Ireland leaders next week that “we will always keep the door open to genuine dialogue”, but that there will be “a necessity to act” if the EU does not allow significant changes to the way the protocol is operating in practice. Whitehall insiders also say that any legislation on the issue is some way off, with nothing yet presented to the cabinet. Johnson will make it clear that the government has never suggested scrapping the protocol and that there will always need to be a treaty in place between the UK and the EU that prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland. He will also recognise the need to protect the integrity of the EU single market. However, he will call for reforms to deal with the trade issues that UK government figures say is imperilling the Good Friday agreement. Critics say that repeated threats to the protocol by UK figures have caused far more significant dangers to the historic agreement. It comes as the US takes a close interest in the treatment of Northern Ireland. President Biden last week urged Johnson not to rip up the Northern Ireland protocol. A powerful delegation of US congress representatives is also due to fly to London within days, in another sign of concern in the White House. Johnson will claim there is “no disguising the fact” that the delicate balance of the Good Friday agreement has been upset by the protocol. He will call for the UK and EU to have the “shared objective” for the trade rules in Northern Ireland to enjoy “the broadest possible cross-community support” when they face a consent vote in the region’s assembly in 2024. On Saturday Labour accused the prime minister of trying to provoke a trade war with Brussels that would exacerbate the cost of living crisis already hitting households. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said that the repeated sabre-rattling over the Northern Ireland protocol came at “the worst possible time”. “Instead of finding practical solutions they are planning a trade war in a cost of living crisis,” Lammy told the centre-left Progressive Britain conference. “Making Brexit work takes statecraft, diligence and graft, not Boris Johnson’s wrecking ball. People in Northern Ireland deserve a responsible government, but instead we have a prime minister who can’t be trusted and a government willing to break international law. “And this comes at the worst possible time. Europe is facing the most serious security crisis in a generation. There is a war on our continent. Millions have fled their homes. Countries have pulled together in support of Ukraine. It is wrong, short-sighted and ill-judged to seek divisions with our European allies as we face this common threat.”",News/UK news,Boris Johnson backs away from Northern Ireland protocol threat ahead of talks,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/14/boris-johnson-backs-away-from-northern-ireland-protocol-threat-ahead-of-talks
5/15/2022,"Pep Guardiola believes Erling Haaland would be content at Manchester City even if the club were to change manager. With Guardiola’s contract due to expire at the end of next season, the City manager has said there is no guarantee he will agree fresh terms, with a decision on his future to be taken at that point. On Wednesday, the club signed the 21-year-old centre-forward on an expected five-year deal, the length of which suggests the Norwegian will be expecting to play under Guardiola for longer than 12 months. “The players who come here don’t come to play for me, they come to play in this league and for this club,” said Guardiola. “It’s so important the people [fans], the way we play, the team we are, the city, where we are in the league, how we are expected to play in the Champions League the next seasons. Many things are involved. “People come not just for a month or a year. Sergio [Agüero] came here and did 10 years, David Silva came here and did 10 years and Vincent [Kompany, actually 11] the same and Yaya Touré [eight years]. Many important players arrive here and stay a long time. How long depends if they are happy here. “What we do is make them feel happy in the city, in the locker room, playing in the Premier League and many things. After that, who knows what will happen. But this is the idea.” Guardiola indicated Haaland, as with all City signings, will have to show he has the right mentality to suit the club. “Everything is in the head, every action you do comes from here – how you handle the pressure and mentality,” he said. “But when you arrive at a club like City and other clubs around the world with standards you either adapt or you can’t be here. There is no secret about that. We have to prove ourselves, myself, too.” Guardiola is not concerned that City’s demanding standards makes it harder to find footballers of the requisite class. ‘There are many top quality players around the world that could fit in here. Without a doubt.” he said. “The world is so big and has a thousand million teams and top, talented players who could play here, for sure. “If there are players with a specially good mentality that want to win again, win again and win again every day [that’s what we want]. The big difference is that the top players can handle the big teams. That is the most important thing to find.” City visit West Ham on Sunday and victory would put them within a point of retaining the title. City have 94 goals and scored 19 in their past four league games, so is reaching 100 in a priority? “Winning the Premier League is important,” he said. “If we score 99 that will be good. But the important thing is to win the Premier League. “We mathematically need four points but we are going to play to win the first one and after then the second one against Aston Villa with our people when everything will be sold out [at the Etihad Stadium] in order to make three points and win the title. That is our only target. That is why it’s West Ham, West Ham and West Ham. Not the future, not anything else. The present is the most important.”",Sport/Football,"Haaland will be happy at Manchester City even if I don’t stay, says Guardiola",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/14/erling-haaland-pep-guardiola-manchester-city
