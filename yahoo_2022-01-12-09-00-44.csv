1/12/2022,"In December, Mad Money host Jim Cramer told members of the CNBC Investing Club that 2022 is the year “to own companies that make stuff, that do tangible things, that innovate.” Now that the calendar’s flipped and growth stocks are slumping a bit, putting your money behind established companies that create unique, in-demand products makes an awful lot of sense. Cramer recently announced his top stock picks for 2022. True to his word, there isn’t an overhyped tech unicorn in the bunch. Let’s find out why the prognosticator believes so strongly in these four companies. “At this point in the business cycle, the playbook says you have to go with more tangible companies that make real things and generate real profits,” Cramer said last week on CNBC. One company he feels fits that bill is Fortune 100 mainstay Honeywell. (The company was ranked 94 in 2021.) As a global industrial conglomerate, Honeywell provides an attractively diversified mix of services and products that range from aerospace and building technologies to safety and productivity solutions. Despite a snarled global supply chain and decreased demand from its deep-pocketed airline customers, Q3 2021 saw Honeywell increase sales by 8% year over year. Earnings per share increased by 29% over the same period. Bausch Health is a Canadian pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets pharma products and branded generic drugs that target a wide variety of health disorders. Pharma and healthcare companies are always intriguing plays during times of high inflation, as their products remain in demand even if prices rise. Cramer, however, is most excited by the fact that Bausch plans on breaking itself into three separate entities: eye health, medical aesthetics and pharmaceuticals. “I like a big breakup story,” he said during a recent episode of Halftime Report. “Among planned splits at Johnson & Johnson, General Electric and Bausch, I like Bausch Health as the best breakup.” Bausch’s stock has risen just under 15% in the past 12 months. Chevron is looking pretty good. America’s second largest oil company continues to benefit from the ongoing inflation-driven rally in energy prices. But it also plans on investing a gargantuan sum of money into its renewable natural gas and hydrogen businesses — $10 billion by 2028 — that should keep the company relevant for decades to come. Chevron had an expectation-topping Q3 last year: $6.1 billion in earnings, $5.6 billion in debt reduction and $2.6 billion in dividends paid out to investors. The company’s stock is up over 30% in just the last four months. It could go even higher. “I like Chevron because I just think that oil is still undervalued even after last year,” Cramer said. Pharma giant Eli Lilly expects the sale of COVID antibody-based treatments to help it make a projected $28 billion in sales for 2021, but the company is also making progress with its experimental Alzheimer’s drug, donanemab. In June, the Food and Drug Administration designated donanemab a “breakthrough therapy” based on preliminary clinical evidence. That means the FDA will expedite the drug’s review. A decision regarding the drug’s approval is expected in the second half of 2022. A bet on Eli Lilly isn’t simply a speculative play based on new drugs. The company’s stock is up more than 215% over the last five years — a very lucrative pickup in recent years, especially if you had invested using free investment apps.

1/12/2022,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) completed a two-month head and shoulders topping pattern on Monday, raising odds for a breakdown that targets psychological support at 100. Accumulation, as measured by On Balance Volume (OBV), has dropped steadily since the stock carved the left shoulder in November, in another sign that shareholders are taking profits and moving back to the sidelines. Of course bulls could save the day, as they often do, but its best to prepare for a volatility surge as market participants react to the set-up. Chip stocks have had a tough time so far in 2022, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index dropping nearly 10% in five sessions into Monday’s midday low.   The decline is worse than it looks at first glance because 400-lb gorilla and perennial laggard Intel Corp. (INTC) has gained 7% so far this year, skewing broad sector averages. NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) highlights typical damage to 2021’s biggest winners, dropping 13% before Monday’s bounce. Advanced Micro Device’s 2022 outlook remains strong but fundamentals may not power the upside because growing worries about rising inflation could undermine buying interest. CEO Lisa Su outlined the bull case in a Monday interview, noting her expectations for a strong year, powered by new chips for laptops and commercial PCs. She also confirmed “very strong” demand that’s forced AMD to ramp up supply and chatted up new investments in artificial intelligence. Wall Street consensus stands at a ‘Moderate Buy’ rating based upon 19 ‘Buy’, 4 ‘Overweight’, 15 ‘Hold’, 1 ‘Underweight’, and 0 ‘Sell’ recommendations. Price targets currently range from a low of $115 to a Street-high $180 while the stock is set to open Tuesday’s session about $9 below the median $144 target. A short-term bounce looks likely, given this humble placement, but a rally above 155 is needed to negate the bearish pattern now in play. Advanced Micro Devices cleared 20-year resistance in July 2020, entering a multi-legged advance that lost steam above 155 in November 2021. A breakout attempt three weeks later failed, carving the head of the H&S pattern, while the December bounce failed at the early November peak. The selloff since that time has reached the neckline in the mid-120s, with 20 to 25-point downside potential into the 100 level, which also marks support from the July breakout.
