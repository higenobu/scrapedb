1/6/2022,"More Macy‚Äôs stores are slated to permanently close in 2022. Days into the new year, the department store chain confirmed a new round of store closures to USA TODAY. Macy's Inc., which also runs Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, identified six Macy‚Äôs and one Bloomingdale‚Äôs Outlet store that will shutter in this round. (See the list below.) ‚ÄúStores remain an integral part of our omnichannel retail ecosystem,‚Äù Macy‚Äôs said in a statement to USA TODAY Wednesday. ‚ÄúAs our business evolves, we continue to optimize and reposition our store fleet to more effectively support our omnichannel sales growth and expand market share.‚Äù ‚ñ∫Save better, spend better: Money tips and advice delivered right to your inbox.

The pandemic led Macy's and other retailers to temporarily close stores for in-person shopping for months. In early 2020, Macy's announced the first closures as part of the store optimization plan. Last January, another round of closings was announced. The Macy‚Äôs stores in the newest closing round are expected to close in the company‚Äôs first financial quarter of 2022, which in past years ended in late July or early August. The Bloomingdale‚Äôs closure is expected by the end of the last quarter of 2021, which is Jan. 29. KMBC 9 News in Missouri reported that Macy‚Äôs said the clearance sale for the Summit Fair store in Lee‚Äôs Summit would start this month and run for approximately eight to 12 weeks. Adrian Mitchell, Macy‚Äôs chief financial officer, said in November that the retailer was taking ‚Äúa second look at the timing of when we close the approximately 60 remaining stores we previously planned to close"" as part of the store optimization plan. ‚ÄúWe expect to announce about 10 closures in January with more details on the remaining stores to come later in 2022,‚Äù Mitchell said during the retailer's quarterly earnings call, noting that some of the closings have been delayed and that the company continues to open more of its smaller, off-mall stores. During Morgan Stanley's Global Consumer & Retail Conference in December, Mitchell said ‚Äúultimately how many stores we close in the timetable still remains to be determined.‚Äù In addition to opening the smaller format stores including the new Market by Macy's concept, the retailer plans to open 400 small Toys R Us shops in its stores starting this year. As COVID-19 cases continue to increase across the nation with the omicron variant, Macy's said it was temporarily revising store hours for the rest of January at all of its Macy's stores. In January, stores will be open Monday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Hours are unchanged Friday through Sunday, which can vary by location. ""Health and safety of our colleagues and customers continue to be our top priority,"" Macy's said in a statement. ""We will continue to monitor the situation and follow the CDC and jurisdictional guidelines as well as keep enhanced safety and wellness procedures in place.""

There's no doubt that 2022 is going to be Rita Ora's year. The pop star rang in the new year on the beach in Australia, where she has been spending plenty of time ocean-side, as well as releasing a new music video for her song with Sam Feldt and attending the Being the Ricardos premiere. ""NYE - from me to you. ‚ù§Ô∏èüïäüòå,"" she captioned the pics. And she's been soaking up the sun ever since. She posted another beach-y post wearing a sparkly pink and orange bikini, sitting beachside. ""Dude I‚Äôm just trying to meditate üßò‚ôÄÔ∏è üåä,"" And in her latest post, she's still soaking up the sun and spending as much time as possible on the beach while wearing a black bandeau bikini. ""I stayed here till I got at least one with a little bit of sun üåû I‚Äôm feeling 2022,"" she captioned the pics. While Down Under, besides spending time on the beach, Rita has also gotten in some sweaty workouts. She posted pics and videos from the gym, and her workout included doing chest presses while in a bridge position on a weight bench. (Dang!) To help push herself, she also works with personal trainer Jono Castano, who shared more about their tough workouts with the Daily Mail. ‚ÄúMy philosophy requires recommending a combination of workouts comprising HIIT, stretching, and recovery. It's important to ensure I hit each of the three areas for a rounded fitness and wellness plan,‚Äù Castano said. ‚ÄúFor example, with Rita, we might focus on HIIT cardio training in the first half of the week, then core and upper body in the middle, and lower body at the end.‚Äù He's also shared tons of videos of Rita on his IG account of getting her sweat on, like this workout that included leg raises, hanging dumbbell holds, and hamster wheels:    A post shared by JONO CASTANO (@jonocastanoacero) And this workout that included hanging weighted knee-ups to strengthen her core:    A post shared by JONO CASTANO (@jonocastanoacero) Plus, she also loves to do yoga as another way to strengthen her body (and mind).    A post shared by RITA ORA (@ritaora) And for nutrition, Rita practices portion control. ""I watch what I eat but I just cut my portions in half,"" she told Cosmopolitan. ""So if I want a burger I'll just cut it in half and eat half of it. That or I'll take the bread off and only eat the burger. Or if I want fries then I won't have a burger to go with them.""

1/6/2022,"‚ö°Ô∏è Read the full article on Motorious Back in 1998, sci-fi TV series The X-Files aired an episode called ‚ÄúKill Switch‚Äù about an AI gone rogue. Told when the internet was still accessed by most using dial-up modems, it was a fascinating tale of technology run amuck, a message about not handing too much of your life over to the digital world. While it might also seem like a sci-fi tale, soon enough the United States federal government could force automakers to install kill switches authorities can access and use to shut down any newer vehicle. Refresh your memory about some of the other crazy things which were in the infrastructure bill here. To many, that might sound like a wonderful idea. After all, we‚Äôve seen wanted criminals who have fled from police only to crash into a car with a family inside, killing innocents as they try to avoid capture. Being able to stop the pursuit early and almost instantaneously seems like a wonderful thing, a potential lifesaver any law-abiding citizen would enthusiastically embrace. According to an article written by former U.S. Representative Bob Barr, hidden away in the recently passed infrastructure bill, the very one I warned before would negatively impact drivers across the country if it were to pass, is a measure to install vehicle kill switches into every new car, truck, and SUV sold in this country. The regulation likely won‚Äôt be enforced for five years, so maybe there‚Äôs time to do something about this. As we‚Äôve seen both in this country and others recently, what constitutes ‚Äúlaw-abiding‚Äù can change drastically overnight. For example, in September a car was pulled over in New Zealand and the occupants arrested when police discovered the trunk was full of Kentucky Fried Chicken meals. They were smuggling the fast food to customers in locked-down Auckland, against quarantine measures. Yet not too long before, delivering restaurant orders to people was considered a reputable, legal activity. It gets even better: Barr points out that the bill, which has been signed into law by President Biden, states that the kill switch, which is referred to as a safety device, must ‚Äúpassively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired.‚Äù In other words, Big Brother will constantly be monitoring how you drive. If you do something the system has been programmed to recognize as driver impairment, your car could just shut off, which could be incredibly dangerous. There is the possibility the kill switch program might measure your driving as impaired, then when you try to start the car up again the engine won‚Äôt fire up. That would potentially leave you stranded. But wait, there‚Äôs more. This kill switch ‚Äúsafety‚Äù system would be open, or in other words there would be a backdoor. That would allow police or other government authorities to access it whenever. Would they need a warrant to do that? Likely not. Even better, hackers could access the backdoor and shut down your vehicle. Barr points out what a tremendous violation of Americans‚Äô privacy this is, and he‚Äôs right. In addition, the term ‚Äúimpaired driving‚Äù isn‚Äôt defined by the legislation, so it would be open to interpretation by regulators such as the Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Do you want government regulators helping to write algorithms which might force your car to pull over and stop because you might be a little tired instead of tipsy? There was never a debate on the House or Senate floor about this issue. Instead, this bill was passed through with many backroom deals I detailed out before here, if you care to learn more about that. It‚Äôs time for not only car enthusiasts but also regular Americans to get loud and tell their US Representatives and Senators what they think of laws like these. Obviously, our elected officials don‚Äôt care too much about our safety or privacy, so we need to remind them what we expect now and moving forward. Check out Barr‚Äôs article here.

1/6/2022,"Treasure hunters who believe they found a huge cache of fabled Civil War-era gold in Pennsylvania are now on the prowl for something as elusive as the buried booty itself: government records of the FBI's excavation. Finders Keepers filed a federal lawsuit against the Justice Department over its failure to produce documents on the FBI‚Äôs search for the legendary gold, which took place nearly four years ago at a remote woodland site in northwestern Pennsylvania. The FBI has since dragged its feet on the treasure hunters' Freedom of Information Act request for records, their lawyer said Wednesday. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a pattern of behavior by the FBI that‚Äôs been very troubling,‚Äù said Anne Weismann, who represents Finders Keepers. She questioned whether the agency is ‚Äúacting in good faith.‚Äù A message was sent to the Justice Department seeking comment on the suit, which asks a judge to order the FBI to immediately turn over the records. Finders Keepers' owners, the father-son duo of Dennis and Kem Parada, had spent years looking for what, according to legend, was an 1863 shipment of Union gold that was lost or stolen on its way to the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia. The duo focused on a spot where they say their instruments detected a large metallic mass. After meeting with the treasure hunters in early 2018, the FBI brought in a contractor with more sophisticated instruments. The contractor detected an underground mass that weighed up to nine tons and had the density of gold, according to an FBI affidavit unsealed last year at the request of news organizations, including The Associated Press. The Paradas accompanied the FBI to the site in Dent‚Äôs Run, about 135 miles (220 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh, but say they were confined to their car while the FBI excavated. The FBI has long insisted the March 2018 dig came up empty, but the agency has consistently stymied the Paradas' efforts to obtain information. The FBI initially claimed it had no files about the investigation. Then, after the Justice Department ordered a more thorough review, the FBI said its records were exempt from public disclosure. Finally, in the wake of the treasure hunters' appeal, the FBI said it had located 2,400 pages of records and 17 video files that it could potentially turn over ‚Äî but that it would take years to do so. Finders Keepers asked the Justice Department for expedited processing, which can be granted in cases where there is widespread media interest involving questions about the government‚Äôs integrity. The Justice Department denied the request ‚Äî and, as of last month, had yet to assign the FOIA request to a staffer for processing, according to the lawsuit. ""From the outset, it seems as if the FBI is doing everything it can to avoid answering the question of whether they actually found gold,‚Äù Weismann said.",U.S./Associated Press,Treasure hunters sue for records on FBI's Civil War gold dig,https://news.yahoo.com/treasure-hunters-sue-records-fbis-170532121.html
1/6/2022,"A South Carolina teacher engaged in sex acts with a student at her home, officials told news outlets. Now, the 34-year-old woman accused of having the encounter is facing a sexual battery charge, according to WYFF. The teacher ‚Äî who Pickens County deputies identified as Katherine Folger Pelfrey ‚Äî reportedly was working for the local school district before officials became aware of the allegations last week. News reports didn‚Äôt list attorney information for Pelfrey, who has been out of a job with the School District of Pickens County since Dec. 31. ‚ÄúThe safety and security of students in SDPC is our top and most important priority,‚Äù school officials told McClatchy News in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúThe District continues to cooperate with local law enforcement to ensure this matter is handled efficiently and appropriately. We appreciate the efforts of our law enforcement in addressing this matter.‚Äù The Pickens County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said investigators received a report about Pelfrey on Dec. 31, two days after she was accused of having the sexual encounter, according to WSPA. It reportedly happened at the teacher‚Äôs home in Clemson, a college town roughly 30 miles southwest of Greenville. In its statement, the Pickens County district wrote that it was ‚Äúunable to discuss ongoing or pending legal matters‚Äù but said Pelfrey had been working as a teacher for the school system since 2017. She was arrested Jan. 3 and faces charges of ‚Äúsexual battery with a student 16-17 years of age and contributing to the delinquency of a minor,‚Äù WHNS reported.

1/6/2022,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) drew some stunned reactions with his latest bafflingly flawed anti-vaccine take. During a familiar rant Monday on a conservative radio show about the merits of relying on the body‚Äôs ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù to COVID-19 after being infected with the virus, the senator asked, ‚ÄúWhy do we assume that the body‚Äôs natural immune system isn‚Äôt the marvel that it is?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy do we think that we can create something better than God in terms of combating disease?‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThere are certain things we have to do, but we have just made so many assumptions, and it‚Äôs all pointed toward everybody getting a vaccine.‚Äù Johnson also boasted that he tested positive for COVID-19 last year but had no symptoms.

1/6/2022,"PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) ‚Äî The competition among U.S. automakers for a still-small pool of consumers seeking electric vehicles is quickly intensifying. General Motors, normally the top-selling U.S. automaker, officially unveiled the Chevrolet Silverado EV Wednesday with a virtual press conference at the CES gadget show. Work truck versions go on sale in the spring of next year, followed in the fall by a high-end consumer version. By then, they'll face competition from rival Ford's electric F-150, startup Rivian's R1T, and possibly Tesla's Cybertruck. Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler, has promised an all-electric Ram. Industry analysts say the intense competition in the electric pickup market means that battery-powered vehicles are moving into the mainstream after years of confinement to luxury or smaller vehicles. Pickups are among the most popular vehicles in the nation. Ford's F-Series is traditionally the top-selling vehicle in America, followed by Stellantis' Ram pickup and the Silverado. Automakers sold more than 2.3 million big pickups last year, about 15% of all vehicles sold in the U.S. Many go for well over $50,000 and are a huge source of profits and jobs with the automakers. But converting buyers from gas and diesel powered V8 and V6 engines may be a tough sell, especially for those who need the trucks for work. ‚ÄúThese are very loyal buyers, and they're not only loyal to the brands, they're loyal to the engines,‚Äù said Jeff Schuster, president of global forecasting for LMC Automotive, an industry consulting firm. ‚ÄúThey know all the specs of what they‚Äôre driving as well. They definitely tend to be motorheads or gearheads.‚Äù Brian James, who works for a Birmingham, Michigan, company that supplies heaters and dehumidifiers for construction sites, says an electric truck wouldn't work for his business, which has clients in four states. Some days they drive more than 400 miles (643.7 kilometers) one-way to deliver heaters. ‚ÄúI go there. I deliver two heaters, and I've got to drive back,‚Äù James said Tuesday at a housing subdivision under construction near Ann Arbor, Michigan. ‚ÄúHow long is it going to take me to charge the batteries?‚Äù for the return trip, he asked, also wondering where charging stations would be located. GM says the new Silverado EV has all the answers. It's planning to sell the truck's roomier cabin and better handling than its combustion trucks. The Silverado, and competitors, also have the ability to power tools on the job site, tow trailers and even power a house when the electricity goes out. The initial Silverado work truck, and a version for consumers that comes out in the fall of 2023, will be able to travel 400 miles on a single charge. It can handle direct-current fast chargers and get up to 100 miles of range in 10 minutes. To ease anxiety over running out of juice, the truck will map a driver's route, showing the optimal charging stations along the way, said Nichole Kraatz, chief engineer on the truck. ""It's really important that we integrate that for the customer so they don‚Äôt feel that pressure and pain point and anxiety about not having enough charge to get through their drive,‚Äù she said. GM has agreements with 10 major charging companies for buyers to seamlessly use their stations, Chevrolet Marketing Vice President Steve Majoros said. The trucks also offer up to 10 outlets to power electric tools at job sites and can go from zero to 60 mph in as little as 4.5 seconds. Initially they will tow up to 10,000 pounds and carry up to 1,300 pounds in the bed, but later versions will tow up to 20,000 pounds. GM wouldn't say the price of the first work truck, but said the early retail version, the RST, will start at $105,000. Lower range versions will become available later, starting at just under $40,000, about the same price as the electric trucks from Ford and Tesla. The $105,000 truck is fully loaded, and although it's about the same size as a gas-powered Silverado, it's got more interior space and better front sight lines, Kraatz said. The truck is built on GM's modular ‚ÄúUltium‚Äù platform on which the company build a number of vehicles, lowering development costs. CEO Mary Barra said in her address at CES a $30,000 Chevy Equinox small SUV on the same underpinnings is coming in 2023, as is a slightly larger Blazer SUV. The Silverado EV looks sleek and doesn't have the high hood with a huge mean-looking grille that come with the gas Silverado. Electric vehicles don't need grilles to send air to cool the radiator. Majoros said GM research has shown the EV will appeal to existing truck owners, but also to people who are new to the segment and electric vehicles. ‚ÄúIf you have something that‚Äôs purpose-built, that still has that sense of strength and confidence but isn‚Äôt over the top, I think that‚Äôs the right place to be,‚Äù he said. GM says it has the flexibility to make work and off-road versions look brawnier. Lower-priced trucks will be able to go more than 200 miles per charge, but GM wouldn't give the exact number. Early results show promise of a big market. Ford says it has 200,000 reservations for the F-150 Lightning electric pickup, which comes out in the spring. Earlier this week Ford announced plans to nearly double annual production, before the first trucks are sold. Tesla reportedly has hundreds of thousands as well. President Joe Biden is pushing to convert the fleet of vehicles to electric to help reach a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. With automakers, he has set a goal that electric cars and trucks account for half of new vehicles sold by 2030. Automakers say tax credits in a stalled $2 trillion social and environmental policy bill are needed to lower the cost of EVs. A $1 trillion infrastructure law authorizes a nationwide network of charging stations and s ets aside $5 billion for states to build them. Schuster said the Silverado EV is another sign that the transition to electric vehicles is taking place, but it won‚Äôt happen overnight. Last year sales of fully electric vehicles rose 87.9% to nearly 489,000, but they still accounted for only 3.2% of the market. Schuster predicts that will rise to 12.8% by 2025 and 33.1% by 2030. ____ This story has been corrected to fix the spelling of Chief Engineer Nichole Kraatz's first name.",Business/Associated Press,New GM electric truck faces competition and skeptical buyers,https://news.yahoo.com/gm-electric-truck-faces-competition-171539147.html
