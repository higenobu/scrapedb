3/11/2022,"Wentworth MP Dave Sharma has denied he is trying to distance himself from the Liberal party following accusations his campaign material mimics the teal colour scheme of the independent candidate Allegra Spender. Locals in the Sydney eastern suburbs electorate have taken to Twitter to point out the striking similarities between flyers distributed by Sharma and Spender. They also point out Sharma’s flyer and neighbourhood corflutes make no mention of the Liberal party of which he is a member. The change in colour scheme can also be seen on Sharma’s Instagram page with recent posts adopting the teal associated with Spender’s campaign while older posts feature the more traditional dark blue of the Liberal party. Sharma’s website, which uses a deeper shade of blue than the distributed flyers, mentions the Liberal party in the fine print only and does not feature the party’s logo. Once a safe seat, Wentworth has become a key battleground for the Liberal party, with Sharma holding it with a 1.3% margin. It was previously held by independent Kerryn Phelps. Sharma on Friday said his campaign material had always been “on the blue spectrum” and denied he was attempting to distance himself from his own party.

Holmes à Court took to Twitter to blast Sharma for the colour choice saying it was “desperately sad”. Evan Ekin-Smyth from the Australian Electoral Commission said electoral laws did not require candidates to display party branding or affiliation. “The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 does not mandate how party branding is used or not used – that includes colours,” he said. “The pamphlet does appear to have an authorisation and the intent of authorisations laws is for people to be able to know who is communicating with them.”",News/Australia news,‘I’ve always been on the blue spectrum’: Dave Sharma denies mimicking independent rival’s colour scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/11/ive-alway-been-on-the-blue-spectrum-dave-sharma-denies-mimicking-independent-rivals-colour-scheme
