4/17/2022,"Over the past two months, the Labour candidate, Adrian Hughes, has knocked on more than 1,000 doors in Upper Gornal and Woodsetton in north Dudley before May’s local elections. The most marginal ward in a historically marginal council, it was won by the Conservatives last year by 82 votes when there were five candidates on the ballot paper. This year there are only two options: red or blue. Like many in his party, Hughes is optimistic that a combination of local grievances and growing anger over Partygate and the cost of living crisis could help turn the tide of Labour’s fortunes in the West Midlands town, after it lost 12 seats last May, giving the Conservatives a majority following a period of no overall control. “We’re all starting to feel a bit of a momentum now. We’ve spoken to a lot of people so we’ve got a good idea of how voters are feeling and they’re angry,” said Hughes. “People are bringing up the Downing Street parties everywhere we go. “I don’t know if we’ll claw everything back in one year, but I think we should see a significant improvement.” Out campaigning the evening after news broke that Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak had been issued with fixed-penalty notices, there was palpable anger among voters. Ron Malkin, 87, said he was “very disappointed” that the prime minister had not been honest and owned up to his mistakes. He has previously voted Conservative, but said he wasn’t sure how he would vote next month. “He could have come clean and told the truth but he didn’t,” he said of Johnson. “I would be surprised if they get in next time there’s a general election after all this.” Susan Webb, a longtime Labour voter and retired civil servant, said she thought Labour had a better chance of winning in the area this time than it had had in a long time. “I feel like the Conservatives have had their chance and failed miserably,” she said, adding that the Partygate scandal had “opened the door” for Labour votes. Further down the street, a nurse returning from her shift said she had been listening to Johnson “denying he had ever lied” on the radio on her way home, something that particularly angered her after the sacrifices NHS workers had made throughout Covid. Leaning out of a back door, her nextdoor neighbour said: “I think it is disgusting that they were having a party when we were all doing the right thing.” Despite the apparent fury over the party scandal, Labour is under no illusions about the uphill battle to win back ground after the Tories took overall control of the council last year with 46 seats to Labour’s 24. “There are some defending Labour councillors in other wards which we lost by 700 votes last year – that’s a lot of votes to win back,” said Hughes. The local Conservatives are adamant they are on track to win more seats despite national turmoil within the party. Partygate “might have an impact on a very small margin. But I think most people are sick to death of this particular story,” said the council leader, Patrick Harley. “Will we have the spectacular results that we had last May? It’s hard to predict. But I certainly think we’ll end up as being a larger group than what we are now.” Dudley is often seen as a bellwether council, having swung between Labour and Conservative (often minority) control over the years. But Labour hasn’t had overall control since 2016, and all four MPs in Dudley are now Conservative. According to Hughes, times are changing, particularly since the party’s change of leadership – Jeremy Corbyn was very unpopular in the area, he said. “There’s no anger on the doorstep towards us any more. Before, a lot of people in Dudley would tell you, if you went and knocked on doors it would get slammed in your face or people would be angry.” Labour is also pushing hard on local issues, such as anger at the council spending £100,000 on sending nine employees to a conference in Cannes during a cost of living crisis – which Harley defended by insisting it would lead to millions of pounds of investment for the region. Qadar Zada, the leader of Dudley Labour group, said Conservative party scandals were welcome news for Labour, but did not diminish the need for the party to present an appealing alternative. “I came into politics to improve the lives of local people, not to capitalise on their sadness, their loss, their grief,” he said. “But having a failing Conservative government is good for Labour, in the sense that we can then put forward our agenda which is good for people.” The deputy leader, Judy Foster, said: “We learned the lessons from last May. We immediately undertook a listening exercise and our manifesto is based on what people were telling us on the doorstep.” In the neighbouring borough of Sandwell, hopes are not quite so high, and there is speculation that the Conservatives could make substantial gains off the back of recent council turmoil. The Labour-run administration has been mired in scandal and misconduct allegations in recent years, and commissioners have been drafted in to run the authority. The council has had six leaders in as many years and an audit last year found there had been a “breakdown in trust, respect and confidence” among governance. And there are fears that an overall disillusionment with politicians could lead to a low turnout across the board in May. “People are annoyed about politics, and we can’t be complacent about that,” said Zada. “We need to make sure people come out to vote. And ultimately rebuild trust.”",News/UK news,‘Voters are angry’: Labour activists say Partygate could turn tide in Dudley,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/17/voters-are-angry-labour-activists-say-partygate-could-turn-tide-in-dudley
4/17/2022,"Priti Patel is under pressure to apologise after being accused of misleading parliament over a central claim relating to her deeply controversial proposals to change immigration law. The home secretary told MPs that the widely criticised nationality and borders bill would create new safe and legal routes to the UK for asylum seekers, suggesting that new routes would ensure that people no longer need to risk their lives trying to reach the UK. During a parliamentary debate last November – held the day after 27 people drowned in the Channel as they tried to cross from France – Patel assured MPs that the bill “does create safe and legal routes”. However, the Home Office has now admitted that the proposed legislation, which is due to go back to the House of Commons this week, in fact contains no provision to provide safe government-backed routes for asylum seekers. A letter dated 5 April from Home Office minister Tom Pursglove to the humanitarian charity MSF UK directly contradicts Patel by stating that safe and legal routes “do not form part of the bill”. Sophie McCann, advocacy officer at MSF UK, said the contradiction was indicative of the manner in which the government and the home secretary had tried to sell the deeply divisive proposals to reform the asylum system: “This is just the latest instance of this government being either deeply misleading or secretive about the provisions and impact of the bill.” She added: “Again we see the government’s slippery relationship with the truth when it comes to acknowledging the harm that will be done to vulnerable people seeking safety to the UK.” A failure to provide safe and legal routes to the UK has led to large numbers of asylum seekers risking their lives crossing the Channel in small boats, a scenario that led to last November’s tragedy, in which a pregnant women and three children were among the dead. So far this year, more ​​than 5,000 people have made the dangerous journey across the Channel on small boats, three times as many as this time last year. Even so, the Home Office has attempted to give the impression that the proposed legislation offers safe routes: a “factsheet” it released last December was titled: “Nationality and borders bill: safe and legal routes”. Although the government has provided some legal routes to asylum, such as the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme, experts say they are inadequate. They point out, for instance, that this would not protect an Afghan asylum seeker who reached the UK by small boat. McCann said: “There are almost no safe ways for someone fleeing war, persecution or poverty to travel to the UK. Instead of helping those most in need, the nationality and borders bill will increase people’s risk of dying trying to get here.” The bill itself, however, is in trouble after being torn apart for a second time by the House of Lords, which recently inflicted 10 defeats on the government over its immigration proposals. Until both the Commons and Lords can agree on the final wording of the bill, it cannot pass into law; the bill will be back before the Commons this week. But with the current parliamentary session expected to end within weeks, ministers may be forced to make concessions if they are to ease the bill through amid an increasingly tight legislative logjam. McCann said: “Even at this late stage, we are urging the Home Office to reconsider: they must drop the inhumane policies in the borders bill and commit to providing safe and legal routes for all people fleeing war and persecution. Make no mistake, this government knows quite well what the impact of this policy will be – it is knowingly and willingly subjecting refugees to horrific suffering.” The Home Office has already admitted that Ukrainians fleeing the war in their country who arrive in the UK illegally would risk jail under the terms of the bill. When asked to explain Patel’s assertion that safe and legal routes were included in the bill, the Home Office said its “new plan for immigration” would strengthen existing routes for refugees, “so they don’t have to put their lives in the hands of people smugglers”. A spokesperson added: “The home secretary was referring to this, and to suggest she misled parliament is wrong. We will continue to provide refuge to those in need fleeing persecution through our global UK resettlement scheme. “Additionally, we will enable more refugees to enter the UK through community sponsorship.”",News/UK news,Priti Patel accused of misleading parliament over controversial borders bill,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/17/fury-as-patels-borders-bill-found-misleading-on-safe-routes-for-migrants
4/17/2022,"Alot of actors would “go into a tailspin” if they lost their director for two weeks during rehearsals for a big stage role, said director Dominic Cooke. But not Nicola Walker. When he returned to the National Theatre for rehearsals of The Corn is Green after a fortnight out with Covid, exclaiming how terrible it was that they had lost so much time, his lead actor put him straight. “She said, ‘Well, I’m not in Ukraine’. And I thought, ‘Yeah that’s you. You’ve got a sense of perspective about it.’” In showbusiness, where being grounded is not a common trait, Walker’s level-headedness makes her stand out. “It’s very straightforward for her. She sees where she is in the bigger picture,” said Cooke. “And that’s an admirable quality in anyone but especially in the crazy world of entertainment.” After decades of gaining growing recognition, this promises to be a big week for the 51-year-old, best known for her roles in BBC dramas Spooks and Last Tango in Halifax, as an MI5 analyst and a farmer respectively, and as a detective chief inspector in ITV’s Unforgotten. She’s playing divorce lawyer Hannah, whose marriage (to Nathan, played by Stephen Mangan) continues to unravel in the final season of The Split on BBC One. Meanwhile, off screen, she is in the process of making a long-awaited return to the stage as a visionary teacher in The Corn is Green, the semi-autobiographical 1938 play by Emlyn Williams, which is at the National until 11 June after a two-year delay caused by the pandemic. And later this year, she’s starring in another relationship-centred BBC drama, Marriage, with Sean Bean. Cooke, who described working with Walker on the play as “a revelation”, said he had never seen her do anything like it. “It’s a different kind of role for her. But she is, I think, made for it,” he said, adding that she seemed “incredibly comfortable” in the starry role, which has been played on screen by Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn. “The thing is, she’s done so much,” said Cooke, who directed Olivier award-winning productions Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom and Follies and the film adaptation of the Ian McEwan novella On Chesil Beach. “Before she did television, she just did years and years of theatre. And when you get that level of experience in an actor, it’s like working with a virtuoso, they have a lot of strings to their bows. They have a lot of resources, and she’s got that.” Her stage credits include an OIivier award-winning turn in The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, winning best supporting actress in 2013, and Beatrice in Ivo van Hove’s acclaimed 2014 Young Vic production of A View from the Bridge, which transferred to the West End and Broadway. Cooke sees her having the kind of trajectory as Judi Dench, who at 87 is still going strong. “The sky’s the limit for her [Walker] and there are going to be amazing opportunities for her in the coming years. She’s definitely got that sort of Judi Dench national treasure potential.” Yet it took a long time for Walker to reach household-name status. Like Oscar-winner and fellow Cambridge graduate Olivia Colman, she had turned 40 before her career started to fly. In her 20s, Walker was warned by older female actors that getting work would be tough once she turned 40. But now she is busier than ever. “The past 10 years have been the best of my career,” she said recently. “I didn’t see it coming.” The year 2020 was her quietest since giving birth to her son, Harry (who she named after Spooks character Harry Pearce) in 2006. Her home life, with her husband Barnaby Kay, also an actor, and son in north London, is said to be “grounded, regular and sane”, and an important part of who she is. Harry, she recently claimed, had not watched any of her work in full because he found it strange seeing his mother on TV. Fortunately, her husband, who she said was “very supportive”, watches everything. The most commonly used adjectives adopted by those who have worked with her seem to be fun, brilliant, intelligent, extraordinary and kind. Dee Koppang O’Leary, who directed her in The Split, said her performances were so layered and nuanced that she didn’t want scenes to end. “She has the most emotional and emotive face I have ever seen – and when the camera is on her, you don’t ever want to call cut.” Chris Lang, the writer of Unforgotten, first met Walker in 2007 when she featured in his show Torn. He knew her from Spooks, but he wasn’t prepared for how good she would be. “She had just had her son, and it was almost her first job back from maternity leave. I remember auditioning her and just thinking she was extraordinary, an amazing actress,” he said. They went on to work together on A Mother’s Son in 2012 and later on Unforgotten, first shown in 2015. Although he wrote the role for her, she was then still not considered a leading actress, he said. “She was just on the verge of making that leap. But I knew from the first time I worked with her that she could carry a show completely.” Part of her appeal, he said, was that she was an empath – both on and off screen. “You identify with her and you see yourself in her. I think that’s quite a rare gift and not many actors have it, but she has it in spades.” Such is her ability to make others believe in her characters that Unforgotten director Andy Wilson, said when her character, DCI Cassie Stuart, died, he had to watch the scene 100 times during editing, and cried every single time. “That’s a tribute to her. Because the person she created in Cassie was so real to me,” he said from set while filming the new series. Wilson said that Walker had changed perceptions of women on TV through the role. “She’s a female lead who’s willing to show you her character’s vulnerability and weakness. She’s willing to be vulnerable and she’s also willing to be the leader,” he said. “It’s a rounded character in a way that I don’t think we’ve really seen before.” He said Walker made him laugh when the bodies arrived on set, when she would always be “vaguely disgusted”. But, he said, the most memorable thing about her on set was “her explosive laughter”. Walker, who was born in Stepney, London, to a father who was a scrap metal dealer and a mother who was an interior designer, started acting when she was 12 at youth theatre but didn’t imagine doing it as a career. As a child she loved black-and-white musicals with stars such as Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers and Gene Kelly. After attending a private school in north-east London, she became the first in her family to go to university. At Cambridge she was taken by her friend Sue Perkins to the university’s Footlights drama club. She has always been true to herself, said friend and creator of Spooks, David Wolstencroft, who remembered first meeting her at a Footlights comedy event. “The overwhelming impression I had of Nicola was that, in stark contrast to a lot of us at that time, she didn’t appear to be trying to be anybody but herself – which, given her talent and career path, sounds paradoxical. But she simply was who she is.” He first saw her on stage in 1990 at a Footlights revue and noted that her “heart and precision was already there”. Wolstencroft said he remembered “the sound of her and Sue Perkins laughing constantly”. After university, Walker got a place at Rada but decided not to go because of the cost and because she was, she has said, “in a rush to get going”. Despite this, many of her colleagues praise her technique. Last Tango in Halifax writer Sally Wainwright said: “There’s something about the detail that she puts into every beat, into every moment, and then makes it look effortless. There’s always a sort of gravitas to any scene that she inhabits.” After university, Walker carried on acting in friends’ plays above pubs. And it was in a play at a pub, alongside Rachel Weisz, that she got the attention of an agent. She struggled to get TV parts in those early days but did appear as one half of the “frightful folk duo” in Four Weddings and a Funeral. Wolstencroft remembers seeing it and thinking “Well, that makes total sense … Off she goes!” He later went on to work with Walker on Spooks, in which he described her as “a centre of gravity for the show”, and in Shooting Dogs, a film about the Rwandan genocide that he wrote. What next for Walker? Does the US beckon? “She’s a rising tide that lifts all boats. I’d love to see her in a big US show. If I’m ever lucky enough to find myself behind the wheel of one of those, I’d beg her to come and play,” said Wolstencroft. But the actor’s approach to this is, characteristically, far more down to earth. When asked recently whether she was tempted by Hollywood, she claimed she mainly associated it with watching Marvel films with her son. She has also said she would like to work with Perkins again. She recently said that she was “practical about acting”, adding: “My dream role is always the job you get next.” Producer Jane Featherstone, who has worked with Walker on Spooks, River and The Split, said her biggest motivation was great writing and colleagues. They first met on ITV drama Touching Evil in 1995 when she was fresh from university. “She was just amazing in the audition, and ITV took the punt on her and we got very lucky” she said. Walker’s ability to be simultaneously ordinary and exceptional made her stand out, she said. “She’s quite unusual, she’s quite special but also extremely relatable, and that’s a rare thing. We’re lucky when we get ones like her, honestly.”",Arts/Culture,"Nicola Walker, star of Unforgotten and The Split, returns to the theatre",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/17/nicola-walker-star-of-unforgotten-and-the-split-returns-to-the-theatre
4/17/2022,"In the fictional African country of Jidada, a tyrant known as the Old Horse is finally set to be ousted from power. With his penchant for autocratic rule, clothing emblazoned with his own image, and a scheming, Gucci-clad wife, NoViolet Bulawayo’s ruler is all too recognisable but for one key factor: he really is an old horse. Inspired by George Orwell’s Animal Farm and drawing on elements of creaturely folktales, the author’s vigorous satire of political turmoil in her native Zimbabwe is “peopled” by animals. The military are “ferocious dogs”, a spurious evangelist is a pig, and the first lady is an ass – literally. Still more plausibly, there’s a tweeting baboon in the White House. It’s not long before the ray of hope glimpsed at the novel’s start is extinguished. The Old Horse, whose rule is said to have been longer than the nine lifespans of a hundred cats, is promptly replaced by his equine former vice-president, Tuvy, and things go from bad to worse, with still more corruption, poverty and government brutality. Bulawayo finds plenty of trenchant farce and surreal humour in the situation, imagining a minister of things and a minister of nothing (homophobic affairs and looting are also portfolios), while Tuvy, now known as “the saviour”, plasters his face on everything from cans of paint to condoms. Social media also provides scope for zesty comedy, with chapters comprised entirely of social media threads. The 40-year-old author writes under a nom de plume, and her debut novel, We Need New Names, which was shortlisted for the 2013 Booker prize, explored the empowering potential of naming. This, her second, broadens that preoccupation to consider language in general, questioning whether our vocabularies remain fit for purpose, having been abused by corrupt politicians and used to tell genocidal tale after tale. “Words were power. Words were muti. Words were weapons. Words were magic. Words were church. Words were wealth. Words were life,” gloats Tuvy. He’s so smitten with the latest meaningless pairing in his arsenal – “new dispensation” – that it becomes the name of his pet parrot. Meanwhile, when a goat named Simiso tries to recount the trauma of genocide in her home village of Bulawayo (sharing its name with both the author and a Zimbabwean city where a real genocide took place in the 1980s) she ends up letting the scars on her mangled body do the talking. It’s the story of Simiso and her daughter Destiny that provides the narrative’s emotional focal point, and Destiny, in becoming a writer and capturing her nation’s past and present, offers a chink of optimism for its future, too. Ultimately, language belongs to us all, and it’s with defiance that Bulawayo harnesses the power of repetition. Words including George Floyd’s final “I can’t breathe” are reiterated, filling entire pages, while formulations that evoke ancient oral storytelling bind the book’s many parts, with the phrase “Those who know about things”, for instance, acquiring wryly incantatory resonance. When the novel flows it takes a line like “on the other paw” to remind us that these characters aren’t human in form, which drives home one of Glory’s most vital and universal observations: that in ordinary circumstances, it’s all too easy “to get used to that which should have otherwise been the source of outrage”. Whether it’s piglets and kittens or men and women who are on the receiving end of outrageous acts, it’s our task to remain indignant, and what better way to signal it than with scornful laughter.

4/17/2022,"The climate crisis is driving a new trend that will change the look of your bathroom cabinet for ever: waterless skincare. While wrapping-free, vegan toiletries have long had a place on British high streets, thanks to independent brands such as Lush, the new wave of waterless – or anhydrous – beauty products is driven by a combination of ethical concerns, innovations taken from Korean skincare and new developments in packaging. Waterless beauty products come as bars, powders, sheets and sticks which either eliminate the need for water or allow you to add the necessary amount at home. In 2020, almost 12% of global personal care launches in the soap, bath and shower category claimed to be waterless. They now account for 23% of the personal care market in the US and interest is growing in the UK and Europe. According to business analyst Future Market Insights, waterless cosmetics sales are predicted to grow by 13.3% by 2031. Ben Grace was managing director of British skincare company Bulldog before he set up waterless brand SBTRCT in 2019. “A lot had changed in a short time – awareness of the climate crisis, water waste, overreliance on palm oil,” he said. “That’s what brought me to solid, waterless and zero-waste skincare. Developing a high-performance range that could do this, but without any compromise on efficacy, made perfect sense to me.” As Grace points out, most traditional skincare formulations contain between 60% and 80% water. “That’s just crazy,” he said. “Consumers should be paying for active ingredients. Condensed and waterless solid formulations give you the best ingredients but without bulking out formulations with water.” Ethique is a New Zealand company started by Brianne West with a student loan. The company sells skincare, haircare and has just launched home-compostable lipsticks. “By removing water, we remove plastic, meaning solid bars are not only saving water and plastic, but also fossil fuel emissions,” West said. “Our bars have an average carbon footprint of just 8% that of bottled products.” She says she is starting to see real change within the beauty industry. “In the 10 years since Ethique started, we’ve noticed bars going from a hard-to-find, niche concept to an accepted alternative on the shelves in forward-thinking retailers. I have faith that the industry can continue to grow and become the dominant format in time. All we need is for retailers to make the jump – consumers are increasingly used to the idea and willing to give things a go.” As well as helping the planet, anhydrous products’ innovative designs can be useful for consumers, too. British start-up Plus Body Wash is a just-add-water formula with 100% dissolvable packaging that goes down the plughole while you shower. Its manufacture uses 38% less water than traditional wash and it’s easy to transport on holiday or to the gym. The luxury market is also converting to waterless products. South Korean beauty regimes have become hugely popular in the west, and many of these products are water-free, less the result of environmental concerns than because removing water means ingredients are more concentrated and need fewer preservatives. Sheet masks are predicted to be a $392m global industry by 2026, for example. Stephanie Hannington-Suen grew up helping out in her parents’ acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinic. After working as a graphic designer, she set up Homework, a natural skincare range that includes anhydrous products because she wanted to provide a higher concentration of active ingredients. “As a graphic designer by trade and growing up around TCM, I wanted to create products that apply a modern approach to ancient Chinese philosophy with the guiding principle of living in harmony with nature. So waterless beauty products seemed the obvious choice,” she said. West encourages consumers to look for social as well as personal benefits to their beauty regime. “Look for products that offer more than just ‘solid’ or ‘waterless’. Products that are vegan, cruelty free or solid are great – but they will offer far more environmental benefits if they offer all three, if they can demonstrate a commitment to their producers – direct trade or fair trade – and employees, and a genuine plan to reduce and offset their carbon production.” As 844 million people currently lack access to clean water worldwide, any action by the beauty industry to change consumers’ behaviour is positive. “Water scarcity is a very real problem,” Grace said. “To keep using it unnecessarily as the biggest ingredient in skincare formulations just isn’t sustainable. We must tackle it, and when I say we, I mean the whole industry – brands, retailers, manufacturers, raw material producers, everyone. The beauty industry can’t run from that.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Waterless skincare: the beauty firms tapping into ethical cleansing,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/17/waterless-skincare-the-beauty-firms-tapping-into-ethical-cleansing
4/17/2022,"Like a bald man masturbating alone into an open pedal bin, Boris Johnson’s Brexit Britain disgusts itself. And yet, despite being observed on the gents’ toilet’s security camera that is the modern world stage, it continues its abasement unabashed. After the second world war, the German volk were described as experiencing kollektivschuld, a national shame. But the capacity for shame has been surgically removed from our leaders. And it pulses only weakly, like some underactive perineal muscle, in the electorate that endorses them. Could it be possible instead for the physical mass of a nation, rather than the citizens it comprises, to display the attributes of shame? Brexiter culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, who didn’t know what the customs union was, has called publicly for the removal of public funding for a TV channel that isn’t publicly funded; Brexiter Dominic Raab, who had not appreciated the importance of Calais, went paddleboarding in Crete while Kabul rescue cats fought to get on British planes; and Brexiter Rishi Sunak, who has all his different breads in all his different houses, took lucrative advantage of tax loopholes that the EU he sought to exit had hoped to close. (A judge told a couple fined £2,000 for having a baby shower, days before lockdown ended, they could pay in instalments if they didn’t spend the deferred money on “Sky Sports or anything”. Sunak, who is worth £200m or more, has been issued with a £50 fine for the lockdown breach he seemed to mislead parliament about. He, too, presumably, can pay in instalments as long as he doesn’t spend the deferred money on any $7.2m Santa Monica beachfront homes. Or anything.) (Johnson has assigned Lord Geidt, the wallpaper investigator, to chair an inquiry into Sunak. This is the same as doing nothing. If I worked in a government office, I would have a bin with a picture of Geidt on it and I would use the phrase “Ask Lord Geidt to chair an inquiry into that” as a euphemism for “Just put that in the bin.” After a few weeks, a new member of staff would say: “You’re quite funny. Have you ever thought of trying to do comedy?” I would try to ask them out and it would go wrong.) But consider Boris in-All-Frankness Pays-Fixed-Penalty Unreserved-Apology Anger-and-Frustration Birthday-Exemption Poledancing-Cyberlover Wallpaper-Freeloader Lebedev’s-Party Watermelon-Picaninny Tank-Topped-Bum-Boys Deprogramme-a-Transperson Fifty-Pound-Offender Dead-in-the-Water Vaccine-Rollout All-Purpose-Get-Out Johnson. Having bent human language to associate Kier Starmer with Jimmy Savile, it appears an actual living child molester, in the shape of the Brexiter Imran Ahmad Khan MP, was still a member of his own party. Meanwhile, Johnson has been belatedly fined for the first of the lockdown breaches he lied to parliament and the British public about. He should, of course, resign, but clings on, like a sheet of shatted toilet roll stuck to the sole of the national shoe. Some say now is not the time for Johnson to go, because of the situation in Ukraine. But on Tuesday, parliament couldn’t meet to discuss chemical weapons in case someone asked the prime minister an awkward question about “gatherings”. People shouldn’t die in cellars as human shields for Johnson’s birthday cake. Disposing of Johnson as soon as possible might at least show Putin that the self-serving engine driving the Brexit that Russia so obviously hoped to secure is now no longer a key component of our corrupt political system. And having allowed so many oligarchs and their families to settle in west London and launder their stolen wealth with impunity means there’s still loads more to get rid of! Then Jacob Rees-Mogg can boast to the EU that we are leading the world in dealing with them!! To summarise, at the start of last week the Conservative party included a child molester, a serial adulterer and compulsive liar, a handsome but morally bankrupt financial whiz-kid and a bully who sends immigrants to Rwanda. That’s less like a government and more like a special team of convicted criminals given their freedom in exchange for accepting an impossible mission behind enemy lines in a 1970s Italian-funded war film. Telly Savalas! Klaus Kinski!! Lewis Collins!!! Helga Liné!!!! Operation Dynamite Bastards!!!!! Perhaps it is still too soon after the Brexit referendum for Brexit Britain to shudder fully at its folly. Brexit’s social, economic and political consequences are still conveniently blamed on Covid, Ukraine, Eddie Izzard and the wrong kind of langoustines. But last week I climbed the 832-metre (2,730ft) Cadair Berwyn, south of LLangollen, and as I looked east, it seemed that vast patches of rural England had somehow turned purple. Either that or some jam from a scone I ate in Bala had somehow got mashed into my blepharitis flakes. The staining phenomenon was first observed, I learned from a civil servant friend, in Staffordshire, where a putrefying mountain of 500 tonnes of British beetroot lay rotting, the betanin leaching into the soil to turn the entire landscape the same shade as a Tory MP’s frothing racist face. Brexit has backlogged our beetroot. Publicly, delays are blamed on P&O, bad weather and Covid. You’ll have to scour lorry drivers’ blogs online to learn about the burden of new Brexit customs checks and the fact that the government’s Brexit IT system has been down for more than two weeks. Last week, the BBC literally edited the word “Brexit” out of the Scottish farmers’ union’s president’s explanation of the industry’s current woes. No one wants to mention the B-word. But my contact warned that if the Brexit beetroot backlog isn’t dealt with soon, it appears the topsoil of the entire country may turn an embarrassing shade of beetroot puce, visible from space.

4/17/2022,"The originalThe West Country dairy farm shindig by which all other musical events are judgedWorthy Farm, Somerset; 22-26 June (sold out) From its hippie beginnings, via an unruly fence-hopping middle period to more genteel iterations of late, Glastonbury remains the festival that sets the template for all others. Free milk in the 60s, regular mud baths every couple of years since; it has become something of a rite of passage for Britons to lose an important part of their brain in a field in Somerset. Sturdy, over-the-calf wellingtons help if you’re trudging from one side of the vast site to the other in a wet year, but the payoff comes with pockets of through-the-looking-glass reality in secluded glades, or mass euphoria in front of culture-setting headliners on the Pyramid stage. The alternatives All Points EastAn eclectic array of quality names in one east London parkVictoria Park, London E3; 19-20, 25-28 August Camping is a big part of the Glastonbury experience. But for a similar array of great artists all in one place, London’s All Points East boasts quality names and there’s no tent required. Most predilections are catered for at this grownup four-dayer whose headliners – a Gorillaz festival exclusive, Tame Impala, who are not playing elsewhere in the UK either – come bolstered by inspired curveballs: rapper’s rapper Pusha T, slacker-rock king Kurt Vile and, in smaller print, synth-pop outfit Japanese Breakfast and white-hot UK garage/techno revivalists Overmono. We Out HereAward-winning hip jazz secret garden partyAbbots Ripton, Cambridgeshire; 25-28 August Love camping, and Glasto’s eclecticism? Curated by Gilles Peterson’s label and held in rural Cambridgeshire, where Secret Garden Party used to be, We Out Here celebrates all the hot young rave-jazz the UK has to offer, and “joins the dots between soul, hip-hop, house and electronica”. Pharoah Sanders is the venerable name attached, but the goodness runs deep with cosmic jazz revelation Nala Sinephro, the haunting electronica of Koreless and Obongjayar all playing live; the vast list of DJ sets spans everyone from Marshmello to Sherelle. There are lovely bell tents to sleep in, or campervan pitches. Gong baths and yoga uphold the Glasto vibe, with wild swimming and kids’ activities too. KE The originalAn idyllic setting, pink sheep, and much more than musicHenham Park, Suffolk; 21-24 July One of the few festivals that went ahead at full capacity in 2021, this sprawling, bucolic paradise of arts and crafts still has some tickets available. If the somewhat bland headliners (Lewis Capaldi, Snow Patrol) are not to your liking, there are far better acts further down the bill, from Little Simz to Phoebe Bridgers, Fontaines DC to Rina Sawayama. As always, music is only one facet of this wide-ranging event, with spaces dedicated to literature, theatre and comedy, as well as activities such as swimming and paddle-boarding. It’s perfect for families, with late-night parties in the woods alongside more highbrow offerings for the grownups. The alternatives BluedotEducation, education, raving?Jodrell Bank Observatory, Cheshire; 21-24 July If you can’t make it to Latitude this year, you can still see headliners Groove Armada at Bluedot, which boasts a similar mix of live acts and intellectual stimulation. Bringing together music and science in the shadow of the imposing Lovell Telescope, the festival has a Luminarium (an immersive labyrinthine tunnel experience), talks and panel discussions with leading scholars, and a family-friendly space camp featuring astronaut Tim Peake. Science not your thing? Not a problem: with acts such as Björk, Mogwai, Kojey Radical, Spiritualized, Kelly Lee Owens and more on the music stages, you can do some cosmic adventuring of your own. LeisureSeaside, fairground rides and pioneering female artistsDreamland, Margate; Fri 24 June Over in Margate, a new one-day boutique event brings together an inspired lineup of leftfield musicians. Indie auteur Mitski tours her superb recent album, Laurel Hell (her only festival appearance this year aside from Glastonbury); she is joined by husky-voiced innovator Nilüfer Yanya, brooding, genre-mashing Londoners Sorry and Nashville DIY artist Soccer Mommy, with more acts to be announced. As with Latitude, music is only part of the attraction. The beachfront theme-park setting is surely the clincher: in between sets you’ll be able to enjoy Dreamland’s amusement rides, arcade games and a roller disco. Keep an eye out for the afterparties. KB The originalAll the biggest names, all the biggest bass dropsDaresbury Estate, Cheshire; 25-30 August (sold out) Featuring household name beat-makers and a DJ set for every mood, Creamfields is celebrating its 25-year commitment to hedonism. It’s the festival that sees your poky dance tent and raises you everything from commercial rave-pop to deep house, from Tiësto to Black Coffee, as pyrotechnics light up the night. Despite the often relaxed attitude of security (maybe because of the relaxed attitude of security), the vibe is reportedly not as “aggy” as similar events. It’s not quite the summer of love – the usual festival toilet complaints apply – but there’s catharsis here for everyone from the serious clubber to the fun-forward newbie. The alternatives Creamfields SouthOne massive party, now airlifted to ChelmsfordHylands Park, Chelmsford; 2-4 June This year, Creamfields has a new southern wing at the Chelmsford site once home to the V festival. The two lineups are very similar and Creamfields’ much-loved Steel Yard mega-tent will be there. Carl Cox, Calvin Harris and David Guetta are just some of the rave-pop giants in the house; Maya Jane Coles, minimal techno DJ Charlotte de Witte and drum’n’bass specialist Harriet Jaxxon are among the female names balancing out this big bro-fest. Junction 2Techno, techno, techno (and more) at the end of the Piccadilly lineTrent Park, London EN4; 18-19 June A more curated experience is on offer at London’s Junction 2, a techno-leaning event now relocated from previously advertised location Boston Manor Park in west London on different dates; only Richie Hawtin has fallen off the schedule. Original tickets remain valid – Saturday 3 June tickets are valid Saturday 18 June and so on. J2’s environs will be even leafier than its previous incarnation (some of it under a motorway flyover), but organisers promise the same attention to detail that has made this event so beloved: high-quality sound systems, intimate sets as well as mass shakedowns and a discerning but friendly clientele. Live sets from the uplifting progressive house composer Ben Böhmer and Jon Hopkins are in the offing, while there are umpteen DJ sessions from everyone from Kevin Saunderson’s E-Dancer to go-hard, nosebleed Italians 999999999. KE The originalThe ultimate summer weekend of global soundsCharlton Park, Wiltshire; 28-31 July The global music festival celebrates its 40th birthday this year, with a lineup as ambitious and inventive as ever. In these leafy and wooded Wiltshire fields, you’ll find Angelique Kidjo reimagining Talking Heads’ album Remain in Light, Fatoumata Diawara’s gorgeous Malian protest pop, the Sugarhill Gang’s hip-hop, and the Flaming Lips’ psychedelic brand of Zorb-and-glitter-cannon-fuelled entertainment. Womad also claims the most kid-friendly activities and workshops of any festival, plus a fairground and a great Sunday kids’ parade. Global food, wellbeing spas and art also soothe the soul. The alternatives Love SupremeJazz, funk and soul extravaganza in the South DownsGlynde Place, East Sussex; 1-3 July If a thrilling mix of jazz and soul is what draws you to Womad, Love Supreme also has a stellar lineup for 2022. They have two UK festival exclusives (Erykah Badu and London jazz scene stalwarts Sons of Kemet and Nubya Garcia playing together), plus Ethiopian jazz legend Mulatu Astatke and soul/disco queen Candi Staton. There are stages for late-night sessions, interviews and local talent, all in a dramatic Sussex Downs setting, as well as plenty of stuff for the kids. Long-table banqueting and wellbeing spas give the experience panache. ElementaryIntimate, hands-on world music weekender, with a family focusBraziers Park, Ipsden, Oxfordshire; 30 June-4 July For a more intimate weekend of global hippy vibes, try the “UK’s friendliest little festival”, Elementary. Here you’ll find lesser-known names but buckets of diversity: Ghanaian drummers, sacred choirs, “organic psychedelia”, didgeridoos and djembes, and intriguing characters such as Israeli musician Yogev Haruvi, who calls himself a human rhythm machine. Workshops are also hands-on and absolutely for the free-spirited, including instrument sessions and dance classes to learn Brazilian forró, Shakti, shamanic and holistic practices and styles. End your days with stargazing sessions for maximum mindfulness. JR The original82,000 people, mad for itHeaton Park, Manchester; 11-12 June (only Sunday tickets remaining) Held in Manchester’s Heaton Park, this is very much a city festival, attracting a home-town crowd primed to party: its compact design adds to an intense vibe, more than an “in tents” vibe. Known for its impressive A-list headliners, vast range of acts and a Mancunian commitment to raving, Parklife’s lineups have been hip-hop-oriented of late; this year it re-hosts 2021’s draw Megan Thee Stallion, plus Tyler, the Creator and 50 Cent as a UK festival exclusive. Further down the bill are Bicep, also back for a second year, Mercury-winner Arlo Parks and TikTok revelation PinkPantheress. It’s a young crowd. The alternatives WirelessAll the hottest hip-hop names, no rapper left behindLondon and Birmingham; 1-3 and 8-10 July Yes, Wireless is in Birmingham (or – shudder – London), which is patently not the same as a Mancunian home-town blow-out. But no other UK event boasts a better lineup if hip-hop (and related genres) are your sounds of choice. Megan Thee Stallion, Tyler, the Creator and pop-soul singer Mahalia are just some of the acts doubling up at Parklife and Wireless, and the Wireless names only get bigger: Cardi B, J Cole and Dave, plus Burna Boy and Popcaan, and drillers of the moment Central Cee and ArrDee. Parklife has a few one-day Sunday tickets left at £84.50; but you can get the coach (return) from Manchester and a one-day ticket to Wireless Birmingham for not much more (around £95). LoveboxHuge mainstream names, from hip-hop to pop, relocate to north LondonFinsbury Park, London N4; 16 July Despite its inception as a dance event, Lovebox is another London festival with a very strong hip-hop pedigree and a generous helping of top-tier mainstream acts just like Parklife; its 2022 Finsbury Park setting makes for great transport links to an Airbnb for the night. Frustratingly, this year’s performers are as yet unannounced, but expect a high calibre. Last time, they hosted Tyler, the Creator, Khalid, Little Simz, FKA twigs and Charli XCX. KE The originalThe Brecon Beacons extravaganza that’s become the Welsh mini-GlastonburyGlanusk Estate, Powys; 18-21 August 2022 (sold out) From its beginnings as a 300-capacity psychedelic folk weekender, Green Man now hosts 25,000 diehards every summer and is a Welsh institution (they still have the bilingual signs). The setting is unbeatable – Crickhowell’s Table Mountain glowering gorgeously behind the main stage – and the musical remit favours adventurous singer-songwriters, indie, electronic and jazz artists (Kraftwerk, Michael Kiwanuka and Cate Le Bon are among the big hitters this year). In recent years, late-night electronica and global sounds in the Chai Wallah’s tent have drawn younger festival-goers, while the Talking Shop tent, science and art, and local beer and cider sustain its intimate soul. The alternatives KiteNew early summer festival of music and ideasKirtlington Park, Oxfordshire; 10-12 June Green Man has always given prominent slots to artists who have quickly progressed to bigger stages: last year’s Self Esteem gig marked her big breakthrough. New weekender Kite has a similarly refreshing lineup, hosting her alongside Saint Etienne, Mavis Staples, Grace Jones, TLC and This Is the Kit, a refreshingly female-heavy top tier. It also has an ambitious attitude to non-music programming, with big names such as Ai Weiwei, David Miliband and Tina Brown talking about art, politics and ideas. Doune the Rabbit HoleScotland’s rising festival starCardross Estate, Stirlingshire; 14-17 July If you love Green Man’s folkier edges, Scotland’s Doune the Rabbit Hole looks a treat, with the likes of Peggy Seeger, Burd Ellen and Richard Dawson peppering an exciting programme. International headliners such as Patti Smith accompany lots of beloved homegrown talent, including Teenage Fanclub and Belle and Sebastian. They go even further with their late-night clubbing inclinations, with the Warren Dance Arena and multiple stages around the woods, although their big names – including Orbital, 808 State and Utah Saints – are likely to please middle-aged raving parents as much as the kids. JR The originalA brain-scrambling day in the parkVictoria Park, London E3; Sat 20 August (sold out) Restored to its original location after a temporary foray to south London, Field Day is synonymous with cutting-edge music in the heart of the city. It somehow encapsulates that pleasurable feeling of wandering through a park, dazed and slightly lost, the satisfying thump of beats pulsing in the background as you try to locate the sushi burrito stand you walked past earlier. While past iterations encompassed lineups spanning indie, hip-hop and jazz, the focus this year is squarely on techno and electronica, with highlights including the Chemical Brothers, Kraftwerk, Peggy Gou, Floating Points and Squarepusher. The alternatives Wide AwakeTop-notch electronica, jazz and post-punk, with green credentialsBrockwell Park, London SE24; 27-28 May Set in Field Day’s 2019 location, Wide Awake shares some of that festival’s original founders and eclectic tastes. After elegant electronica? Here are Bicep, Caribou and Floating Points. Want some loud guitars? Enter Fat White Family, Yard Act and Amyl and the Sniffers. Jazz enthusiast? Please enjoy The Comet Is Coming. Expanded to a two-day event after its first outing last September (the planned launch in June 2020 did not go to plan), the festival prides itself on its focus on sustainability: the eco policy promises zero waste in landfill and a ban on single-use plastic. ForwardsA wide-ranging newcomer with a stellar inaugural lineupClifton Downs, Bristol; 3-4 Sept Further afield, Bristol’s new Forwards festival hosts a similarly broad mix of genres. Field Day headliners the Chemical Brothers appear here, alongside Jamie xx, Little Simz, Self Esteem, Sleaford Mods and Texas psych-funk trio Khruangbin. It is perhaps no surprise that this newbie has attracted such an exciting array of musicians: it is promoted by the same team behind Coachella and BST Hyde Park. As the name suggests, it’s a progressive-minded festival – in addition to two main music stages, the website promises a space for activism and debate featuring “experts, disruptors, artists, writers and thinkers”. Don’t check your brain in at the door. KB The originalMusic-focused end-of-summer celebration, now in its 16th yearLarmer Tree Gardens, Wiltshire; 1-4 September (sold out) Sitting right at the end of the school holidays, and packed with 6 Music-friendly alternative, indie and Americana, End of the Road is the perfect record-lover’s farewell to the summer festival season. This year’s lineup includes US heroes (Pixies, Bright Eyes, Magnetic Fields), contemporary darlings (Aldous Harding, Kurt Vile, the Anchoress), and newcomers (Sniffany and the Nits, Apollo Ghosts). There are other attractions – the Wonderland area for kids, book talks in the woodland library, magical installations and happenings in Larmer Tree Gardens’ gorgeous wooded setting – but this one’s all about the bands, and quick to sell out as a consequence. The alternatives SeachangeA music-filled south-west weekend run by a record shopVarious venues, Totnes, Devon; 27-29 May Fans of End of the Road who fancy a weekend with similar quirky character should try Seachange, now in its fifth year. Run by Totnes’ wonderful record shop, Drift, it’s an indie kid’s dream of a three-dayer, and music acts play in venues dotted around the town (including a Grade 1 listed church, a gold-ceilinged ballroom and a restored cinema). The biggest names for 2022 include the Charlatans’ Tim Burgess, Porridge Radio, Keeley Forsyth and Gwenno, and the tickets are less than £100 for the weekend, plus the cost of accommodation. Manchester Psych FestLots of alternative action in the northern city of soundVarious venues, Manchester Oxford Road; 3 September Those not wanting to miss their end-of-summer, back-to-school indie vibes should check out Manchester Psych Fest, which is full of gigs in the alternative venues around the city’s Oxford Road station. It being the same weekend as End of the Road, some acts are also heading up the M5 to be there too, including Kurt Vile and Tinariwen so far. There are also art installations and exhibitions, as well as festival food and booze courtesy of the city’s DIY courtyard complex of breweries and restaurants, Hatch. JR Self EsteemPerforming at: Kite, Glastonbury, Latitude, All Points East, Forwards When I do a headline tour of my own shows I come back and feel like I’m absolutely untouchable, but it’s really good to put yourself in a festival situation and get back to winning crowds over. There’s something really special about that feeling – when it’s sunny and you’re just about to go on stage – that is so evocative and beautiful. At the last Glastonbury I played three shows in a weekend, and it became like an endurance test; there were some fans that came to every single one. It really felt like we’d completed Glastonbury. I’ll never forget that. This summer I’m excited to see Beverly Glenn-Copeland – I’m the biggest fan. It’s really fun when you notice, “Oh, I love that artist. I’ll be there and I can go for free.” The novelty of that doesn’t wear off, since being a 16-year-old girl who goes to festivals, and somehow now it’s their job. BicepWide Awake, Parklife, Glastonbury, Green Man, Creamfields North Andy Ferguson: There’s only so much you can learn from Spotify algorithms; it’s very different walking around a festival and stumbling across new acts. My favourite festival memory was at Glastonbury on a Sunday evening. I was in a bar and it was boiling hot and everyone was a bit frustrated – a guy was trying to get served but he said to the person next to him, “No, it’s you next,” and then that person said, “No, it’s you next,” and it turned into this thing where the whole crowd was going “It’s you next” and nobody ended up getting served. The bar staff stood up and started clapping – it was peak Glastonbury.Matt McBriar: I think it’s the collective enjoyment of music that was really missing through the pandemic. When you experience music with people you don’t know, it’s so much more euphoric. We’re both really looking forward to seeing Slowdive live – we rediscovered them in lockdown and they’re playing at Primavera in Barcelona on the same day as us. I can’t wait. Joy CrookesParklife, Glastonbury A festival weekend is quite primal – there’s not much overthinking. It’s so spur-of-the-moment: not knowing where you’re going to go next, what you’re going to eat, who you’re going to bump into. I love that spontaneity – that intimacy and messiness. My favourite festival memory is seeing Grace Jones perform at Latitude: watching a woman of her age and calibre hula hoop for an entire 60-minute set is not something you ever forget. She was so fiercely unapologetic. I was really impressed. She’s a living legend. I’m really looking forward to her Meltdown in London this year. I’m also excited to see Kendrick Lamar at Glastonbury – I’ve seen him live twice, but I still love every moment of it when I see him. Yard ActWide Awake, Doune the Rabbit Hole, Bluedot, End of the Road James Smith: There’s something about a stage in a field, and everyone being away from the stresses of their day-to-day lives – that’s a feeling you don’t get anywhere else. I’ve missed being surrounded by other human beings in the common cause of music and hedonism. I think my favourite act I ever saw at a festival was Patti Smith at Roskilde in Denmark. I’d recently lost a friend, and she played a straight-up punk cover of the Jim Carroll Band’s People Who Died. It was the most uplifting, spiritual thing. At one point she said, “This is how you do a guitar solo”, and she picked up this black Telecaster, threw herself on the floor and just rolled around for about five minutes. It was hypnotic. This summer I’m hoping to see Little Simz live – I’ve been trying to, but our sets keep clashing. I think that’s gonna be a special one. KB",Arts/Music,Favourite festival sold out?

4/17/2022,"Facebook is struggling to contain pro-Russian and anti-western posts that are contributing to political instability in west Africa, investigators and analysts have said. The platform, which has expanded rapidly across the continent in recent years, has made significant investment in content moderation, but still faces enormous challenges in curbing deliberate disinformation campaigns. One major area of concern is the strategically important Sahel region, which has suffered a series of military takeovers over the last 18 months. Campaigns on Facebook appear to have prepared the ground for many of the coups, pushing an anti-western, pro-Russian agenda that has undermined governments. The efforts are similar to the “hybrid warfare” campaign launched by Moscow in Ukraine and elsewhere. A report by investigators from the Digital Forensic Lab, a global network of digital forensic researchers run by US-based thinktank the Atlantic Council, reveals how pro-Russian Facebook pages in Mali coordinated support for anti-democracy protests and the Wagner group, a controversial Russian private military contractor that was invited into the unstable country last year after the overthrow of President Bah N’daw by the military. The US and others have alleged that Wagner is funded by the powerful businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is closely linked to Vladimir Putin. It has a growing presence in Africa and its mercenaries have been deployed in Mozambique, Sudan, Libya and in Central African Republic, where Wagner group fighters committed human rights abuses while fighting alongside government forces against rebels, according to a group of independent UN experts. Prigozhin and the Kremlin have denied any knowledge of Wagner. Western officials described Wagner as the “thin end of the wedge” and a “Trojan horse” for a Russian effort to extend its influence covertly in resource-rich and unstable parts of the continent. Earlier this year, France announced that it was withdrawing thousands of troops from Mali, ending a near decade-long effort to fight Islamist insurgents from bases there. The Wagner group has deployed between 400 and 600 fighters, trainers and support staff to Mali and appears to have already launched offensive operations against extremists. In early April Human Rights Watch reported that suspected Russian mercenaries had participated in an operation with Mali’s army in March in which about 300 civilians died. HRW did not mention Wagner specifically. The DFR Lab identified a coordinated network of five pages pushing narratives that promoted Russian intervention in Mali while disparaging the west, and France in particular. The pages have published nearly 24,000 posts and are followed by more than 140,000 accounts. In September 2021, the pages of the network began promoting Wagner as an alternative to the French forces. Pages in the network frequently posted identical content, often less than 20 seconds apart, the DFR Lab found. In a second report, DFR investigators found that pro-Russian content spread on Facebook in west Africa in the months before the military takeover in Burkina Faso in January. Hours after the coup there, demonstrators in Ouagadougou, the country’s capital, chanted pro-Russian and anti-French slogans. Independent fact-checkers labelled several posts as misleading, including a pro-Russian page that repurposed images of apparently well-equipped hobbyists in combat gear as Russian soldiers. The DFRLab has an ongoing partnership with Facebook to independently monitor the platform for disinformation campaigns, with a particular emphasis on election interference, and receives funding from Meta. Facebook declined to take down the pages described in the reports when alerted, saying that though posts were clearly part of a coordinated effort, they did not appear to be a front for unidentified users and so “inauthentic”. Many posts that breached Facebook’s moderation polices have been labelled as false or misleading after being investigated by third-party fact-checkers, a spokesperson said. Toussaint Nothias, research director at the Digital Civil Society Lab of Stanford University, who has worked extensively on Facebook, said the decision was surprising and underlined the big challenge of effective content moderation. “The boundary between inauthentic and authentic coordinated behaviour is very tricky to manage. Authentic coordinated behaviour can often resemble social movements, and determining when this behaviour is harmful depends largely on the context and standpoint,” Nothias said. A spokesperson for Facebook’s owner, Meta, said the company took the problem of coordinated campaigns seeking to manipulate public debate very seriously and was taking aggressive steps to fight the spread of misinformation in Africa as elsewhere. “We’ve built the largest global third-party fact-checking network of any platform and in the last few years we’ve more than doubled the number of countries we cover across the continent,” the spokesperson said. “While nobody can eliminate misinformation from society entirely, we continue to consult with outside experts, grow our fact-checking program, and improve our technology to tackle it on our services in the most comprehensive and effective way possible.” Facebook has moved repeatedly in recent years to take down hundreds of “inauthentic” accounts targeting Africa, many linked to Moscow. In October 2019, Facebook took down three networks of accounts linked to Prigozhin. The accounts were actively seeking to influence the domestic politics in eight countries: Madagascar, the CAR, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Sudan and Libya. In 2020, Facebook targeted a second Russian-led network of professional trolls outsourced to Ghanaian and Nigerian operatives. The DFR report on the recent Mali accounts – and Facebook’s decision not to take down the network – underlines the risk of actors exploiting loopholes in the company’s policies. Experts say influencing efforts have become more sophisticated, and are likely to involve hiring individuals who will push a particular narrative. This makes it much harder to establish whether such operations are “inauthentic” and thus breach Facebook policy. “It’s not bots any more. The major [social media] firms are very good at identifying bots … There are real people behind the accounts.” The trend has been a tactical shift for Prigozhin-linked operations. Local operators offer a better understanding of the context on the ground and a level of plausible deniability,” said Shelby Grossman, a research scholar at the Stanford Internet Observatory. Jean Le Roux, author of the new DFR report, said those behind the most recent networks could have been people in Mali who were genuinely supportive of Russia’s efforts and anti-French, or members of a “franchising operation using locals who know the slang, the vernacular”.",News/World news,Facebook struggles as Russia steps up presence in unstable west Africa,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/17/facebook-struggles-as-russia-steps-up-presence-in-unstable-west-africa
4/17/2022,"Six people were arrested after climate-change activists clambered on top of an oil tanker in central London on Saturday. Environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion said three people in Bayswater Road had climbed on top of the Shell tanker where they held up an “End fossil filth” banner while other demonstrators gathered around the vehicle. Among those taking part in the protest were Olympic gold medal-winning canoeist Etienne Stott and fellow British Olympian Laura Baldwin. “I am acting to try to disrupt the toxic fossil fuel industry that is destroying everything we hold dear,” Stott told reporters. Images from the scene show campaigners holding Extinction Rebellion flags. The Metropolitan police said six individuals had been arrested for vehicle interference and added that the road was reopened by noon. The incident was the latest in a coordinated series of Easter protests by demonstrators who are calling for a halt in all investment in fossil fuels in the UK. On Thursday, four activists glued themselves to the top of an Eddie Stobart fuel tanker at the Chiswick roundabout that feeds traffic from west London on and off the M4. From the side of the lorry, they draped flags protesting about Britain’s use of fossil fuels. And on Friday, hundreds of protesters blocked Waterloo, Blackfriars, Lambeth and Westminster bridges in London as part of their campaign. No arrests were made, police said. These protests continued across London on Saturday. According to the Met, activists were walking through central London where they “stopped at various locations along their unspecified route, causing disruption”. Later in the day, campaigners gathered for a major demonstration in Hyde Park. Meanwhile, Warwickshire police said nine people have been charged after a separate climate activist group, Just Stop Oil, held a demonstration at an oil terminal in Kingsbury, near Tamworth in Staffordshire. A dozen activists locked themselves on to pipes there as part of their campaign to get the government to halt all new oil and gas projects. Similar demonstrations have also occurred at the Navigator oil terminal in Thurrock and Grays oil terminal, both in Essex, and follow the decision by a number of key operators – including Navigator, ExxonMobil and Valero – to obtain injunctions to try to prevent protesters from blocking operations there.",News/Environment,Six arrested after climate activists scale oil tanker in central London,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/17/six-arrested-after-climate-activists-scale-oil-tanker-in-central-london
4/17/2022,"On Thursday night last week, Sea Power played a headline gig at the Roundhouse in London, a Grade II-listed former engine shed. A beautiful space and an important centre for youth arts education, it’s one of live music’s success stories. A week later, the band will play at Sheffield’s Leadmill, the centre of a bitter row after the venue’s landlords issued a notice of eviction. Arctic Monkeys, Pulp and the Kaiser Chiefs have all joined a campaign to save the Leadmill, in the vein of dozens of similar efforts over the years to save famous venues, from Manchester’s Haçienda to London’s Fabric nightclub and CBGBs in New York. Many smaller venues have shut after these battles failed. The Bull & Gate, where I first saw Sea Power play 20 years ago, was a pub just up the road from the Roundhouse, and is now closed, a fate shared by many rooms they’ve haunted during their long career. After a battering from coronavirus, live music in the UK continues to struggle, with audiences wary of returning to crowded gigs, and grassroots venues taking on £90m of debt just to survive. A crowdfunding campaign by the Music Venue Trust has raised nearly £4.5m for 270 projects across the country. It can often feel that the picture for live music in Britain is beyond bleak, but it’s more complex than it can at first appear: it’s not just the fault of the usual culprits such as greedy landlords, property developers and moaning neighbours. The decline of regional touring reflects how, in an age of Netflix and gaming, live music now has to compete with far more demands on our cultural time and interest, not to mention wallets, in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. Old tour adverts show that bands would play numerous dates in one city, and visit places that no longer have live venues. The Wake Arms, in the middle of Epping Forest, once hosted gigs by Hawkwind and Genesis, while the now demolished West Runton Pavilion, out on the north Norfolk coast, welcomed the Sex Pistols, Chuck Berry and Black Sabbath. A friend’s uncle who works in one of the shipyards in Plymouth told me the city’s problems went hand in hand with the decline of its music venues. He used to be able to watch bands such as the Fall every week – now most acts tend to travel only as far as Exeter. Without a musical culture, any region suffers. It’s easy to get misty-eyed about buildings, and some, such as the Haçienda, get elevated along with the nostalgia and myth-making for the scene they hosted. Friends who went to the club say that when it opened in 1982 it was often depressingly empty, and before closing in 1997 it had a nasty, heavy vibe, far from the euphoria of its acid house peak. There was widespread anger when London’s Astoria was demolished to make way for Crossrail, yet it was a dilapidated box I remember only for bad sound, overcrowding and overpriced warm lager in cans. Venues come and go, and have their good and terrible phases. The churn of cities is part of what makes them exciting places to live, and that process is often more tricky than we might assume. In 2019, there was a campaign to save the Macbeth on London’s Hoxton Street after noise complaints from neighbours. However, when I lived around the corner in the early 2000s, the Macbeth was a genuine community boozer with an amazing karaoke night, and one year everyone sang me Happy Birthday. It was a blow when it became a music venue, and the formerly mixed crowd was dispersed. When venues serving marginalised people are closed, there tends to be less press outrage or campaigning to save them – the excellent if depressing Instagram account London Dead Pubs, full of before-and-after photographs of old Victorian drinking establishments replaced by anonymous flats, gives the histories of countless venues that served the black community with reggae and dub nights but were shut down with little in the way of mainstream protest. Whether they served a particular group of people, nurtured a musical movement, or (let’s not be snooty) a room where a covers band could get out of themselves for an hour of musical fantasy, the crime is that venues are rarely replaced, leaving many towns and cities without large and grassroots spaces alike. Look beyond the doom and gloom, and the picture is more mixed. In Sheffield, new venues are being created in the redevelopment of the city centre, while Sidney & Matilda, Delicious Clam and Bal Fashions opened fairly recently and are all thriving. Cafe Oto, the London home of experimental music, has just celebrated its 14th birthday. In Yorkshire and Lancashire, the Transpennine underground is sustained by Hebden Bridge’s Trades Hall, Todmorden’s Golden Lion and Manchester’s notoriously feral White Hotel. Like Camden’s Roundhouse, Newcastle’s Boiler Shop saved an important part of our industrial heritage (the first steam locomotives were built there) and puts on industrial music from the likes of Einstürzende Neubauten alongside the wildly popular Bongo’s Bingo. These venues, providing services and entertainment beyond just music, show how it’s possible to adapt to survive. When I look back at the life-changing musical moments in my life (the uncanny murmur of Throbbing Gristle at Heaven, still dancing four hours before I had to get up for work every Monday at Trash at long-closed nightclub The End), it’s not the physical space I remember but the vibrating molecules, the feeling of collective joy within them. The same thing happened at the Roundhouse when, during their pro-immigration anthem Waving Flags, Sea Power lifted the roof off. Music venues are the incubators of connections and memories. As fans of music of all stripes, we need not just to lament the past but support those trying to do something new.

4/17/2022,"Iwas much taken by the recent appointment of Maj Gen Sharon Nesmith as deputy chief of the General Staff, the first female lieutenant general, and her bold “mission statement”: “I feel deeply honoured to be appointed as deputy chief of the General Staff at such a pivotal time for the British army. I look forward to playing my part in leading our Future Soldier transformation to become a more lethal, agile, digitised and expeditionary force.” Blimey, martial or what? Especially the use of the word lethal. And I have no doubt that she will succeed admirably in her aims, but I couldn’t help but be reminded of what the Duke of Wellington said, contemplating his troops on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo: “I don’t know what effect these men will have upon the enemy, but, by God, they frighten me.” I’m eternally glad that she’s on our side. Her remark reminded me of a couple of my favourite military quotes. “C’est magnifique, mais ce n’est pas la guerre; c’est de la folie,” was General Pierre François Joseph Bosquet’s incomparable opinion on the Charge of the Light Brigade, while I especially treasure: “My centre is giving way, my right is retreating, excellent situation, I am attacking,” Marshal Ferdinand Foch’s message to Marshal Joseph Joffre during the first battle of the Marne in 1914. After my column last week on going to hell in a handbasket, I was cheered by an email from Ruth Eversley: “The woman who thought we were ‘going to hell in a handbasket’ may have been influenced by the actor Joan Collins who once said she thought the country was going to hell in a ‘hand castle’.” She also pointed out a priceless remark from Grant Shapps, who recently said his department was going through legislation with a “fine tooth pick”. I fear being Boris Johnson’s chief apologist is finally getting to him.

4/17/2022,"There is a green jacket in the corner of Stuart Lawrence’s room that belonged to his murdered older brother Stephen. It’s from the iconic 90s hip-hop brand Cross Colours, behind the multicoloured shirts famously worn by Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Stuart holds it up to his webcam, so I can read it. The label says: “Post Hip Hop Nation, Academic Hard Wear.” It was so like Stephen to have an item of clothing from the cult hip-hop label, he says. Stephen was his handsome, cool, older brother; the person Stuart looked up to, and occasionally resented for his easy charm. “The jacket was one of the pieces he was most proud of getting,” says Stuart. “He always had the coolest clothes, always had his finger on the pulse of what everyone was wearing.” Stuart can still see Stephen shrugging on the jacket over his grey hoodie and heading out to a hip-hop night. The jacket is much like Stephen’s presence in his life: quietly, unobtrusively there in the corner of the room at every family gathering, every celebration, every milestone. “It means more to me,” says Stuart, fingering the jacket, “than anything I personally own myself. It’s one of the things I’d definitely grab if the building was on fire.” We’re speaking about the release of Silence is Not an Option, a self-help manual for young people based on Stuart’s insights from his 15-year career as a secondary school teacher, as well as his reflections on his brother’s life and death. “I could imagine what Stephen would be like now,” writes Stuart movingly in the book, “but that would be like jumping down a rabbit hole. Imagining would probably bring great sadness. Thinking about what he could have and would have been.” Stephen was 18 when he was murdered in an unprovoked racist attack while waiting for a bus in Eltham, south London, in April 1993. His alleged attackers – Gary Dobson, Neil and Jamie Acourt, David Norris and Luke Knight – were a well-known local gang, and their names were given to the police within days. But the Metropolitan Police bungled the investigation. After campaigning by the Lawrence family the resulting Macpherson Inquiry concluded in 1999 that institutional racism contributed to the Met’s failure to bring them to justice. Finally, in 2012, Dobson and Norris were convicted of murder. Silence is Not an Option is full of accessible, practical insights for young people. Stuart, who is now a motivational speaker and youth engagement specialist, counsels them to take constructive criticism, set goals, limit their screen time, think positively, and surround themselves with people from different walks of life. “It’s about trying to help kids,” he says. “If I can help them navigate this difficult world, and try not to listen too much to the noise outside, then they can really start from a good platform.” Stuart is Zooming me from what looks to be his spare bedroom at home in Brixton, south London. “My son’s not well today,” he apologises, plugging in a ring light so I can see him better, “so I’m not in my usual room.” He is an engaging, voluble and often hilarious interviewee – and I am left wondering whether his wisecracking personality developed in part as a coping mechanism and a way to disarm people following Stephen’s murder. As we’re wrapping up, I tell him, slightly guiltily, that I didn’t expect to laugh so much given the serious subject matter. “I’m glad… I’ve always tried to be an optimist and to have as much hope as I can in my heart,” he responds. He did not always feel this way. When writing the book, Stuart drew upon the experiences of the alienation, rage and estrangement he felt after Stephen’s murder. The day after Stephen died, Stuart, then 16, went to school. “I carried on,” he says, “and, on reflection now, I think to myself, was that the best thing to do? Should I have taken some more time?” But Stuart knew the rumour mill would be operating and he wanted to find out who might be responsible. And he was right: that afternoon, Stuart came home with some names and gave them to his parents, who gave them to a police liaison officer, who did nothing with them. Just a few months after Stephen’s murder, Stuart insisted on taking his GCSEs – and flunked them. He was angry all the time, but he felt he had to suppress this anger, because newspapers were already running with the false narrative that Stephen was a gang member, and Stuart didn’t want to do anything to give these lies credence. “I had to keep the tiger tamed within,” he says. As a result he decided that he’d allow himself to be angry twice a year. “So if I lost my temper in January it was, like, well that’s you: now you’ve got the rest of the year to try and manage that.” He would fantasise about taking revenge on his brother’s murderers. “But what’s that going to do? Lead to shame on my mum and dad, and the police coming down on me. That’s not going to end well.” Stephen’s murder marked the end of what had been a happy childhood – the brothers were close and shared a bedroom, his parents, Neville and Doreen, were strict but loving and, although, looking back, he “had the middle child syndrome going on”, he says he was happy to be the one overlooked. “I wasn’t as cute as Georgina [his younger sister], or as good and clever as Stephen.” And even at school, where he was one of only two Black children in his class, he says he never experienced racism or felt like the odd one out. After Stephen’s murder, all that changed overnight. The Lawrence house filled up with relatives and well-wishers who stayed for months. “I’d leave the house during the day and there’d be my aunt, uncle, my mum and dad, and I’d come home in the evening and there would be another 20 people,” he says. “It just wasn’t something I was used to because we never had lots of people around our house.” In the end, he moved in with his youth club leader for a year, to get some space and focus on finishing his education and getting into university. Controlling his emotions during this time was in itself a form of violence. The Lawrence family had to accept not only that Stephen was dead, but that his killers were free. This cauterised their ability to grieve, because all they could focus on was securing justice. “We should have had time to be able to come to grips with it,” says Stuart, “but we were just in fight mode all the time.” The failure of the Lawrence family’s private prosecution of Stephen’s alleged killers in 1996 was a nadir. “That’s when they gave up hope,” says Stuart of his parents. It took Stuart a little longer. Nearly every year, new information came out about Stephen’s murder. Having his hopes raised, only for them to be repeatedly crushed, was unbearable. “After 2001,” he says, “I came to a point in my life where I was, like, it’s never going to happen. We’re never going to have a positive outcome to this. So there’s no worth in me having any hope. I put it to bed then.” He decided to try to move on, and have as normal and happy a life as possible. But he looks like his brother – they have the same eyes, the same bone structure – and his surname carried with it a portentous weight. “I’ve become more comfortable in it,” he says of the legacy of being Stephen’s brother. “It was something I ran away from quite a lot in my younger years, because I suppose there’s an identity thing where you want to be known for yourself and what you can bring to the table.” As a result, he wouldn’t mention Stephen in conversation and instead would wait for people to work it out. When he met his wife, Angie, at university in Northampton in 1999, he told her to buy a newspaper: “I just couldn’t find the words to tell her,” Stuart explains. In 2011, they had their son, Theo. It was the same year the CPS began its trial of Dobson and Norris for Stephen’s murder. Becoming a father made Stuart confront what his parents had endured all those years previously. “Just looking at Theo for the first time made me realise, clear as day, the pain and anguish of having this little person and them getting ripped away.” He took nine months off work and attended the trial at the Old Bailey every day. He thought he knew the case inside out, but was stunned by the new evidence he was hearing. “It was difficult because it was like someone had hit the reset button,” he says, “and I was back to 1993.” Theo is now 11. “I know in time you will grow into a great and wonderful man and your light will shine bright forever, as you remind me so much of Stephen,” writes Stuart in Silence is Not An Option. Does he worry about Theo walking the streets of London as a young Black male? Young Black men living in London are 19 times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than the rest of the public, while Black Londoners are three times more likely to be murdered than other ethnic groups. “I try not to scaremonger him too much about stuff,” says Stuart, “because what happened to Stephen was totally random.” Yet Theo has seen Stuart pulled over by the police. Stuart recalls him asking: “Why was that man so angry? Why did he talk to you like that?” The week we speak, news breaks of the strip-search of a menstruating Black teenage girl in a Hackney school. Police were called in after staff thought they smelled cannabis on the girl, known only as Child Q. Stuart is horrified. “It makes me feel ashamed of having been a school teacher,” he says, before adding: “Can you imagine how many more cases we’ve got to hear about before we get to the bottom of all this racist treatment of schoolchildren? Because the process takes so long.” The Lawrence family is still awaiting the publication of an Independent Office for Police Conduct report into whether corruption was a factor in the mishandling of the original investigation into Stephen’s murder. “It’s been eight years now,” says Stuart. “And we’re only starting to hear things now because this set of IOPC people are a little better than the ones we had before.” Despite everything that has happened, he doesn’t blame all police officers. “I try not to bash them too much. They’re not all the same,” he says. In November 2021, Stuart called the police after his house was burgled. “I’m not from that world where I can call up the underground and say, ‘I’ve been robbed, put the feelers out,’” he jokes. When officers came around, they noticed a picture of Stephen on the wall. “I saw one of them clock it,” he chuckles. “I do feel I was treated a little differently after that.” Stuart has witnessed his parents’ fight for justice and how their campaign changed policing and attitudes around institutional racism in the UK. His mother, Doreen, is now a Labour peer with a brief around inequality and racial justice. “The number of times that I’m with my mum and people see her and go, ‘Oh my God,’” he smiles. The Lawrence family are arguably the most high-profile racial justice campaigners in the UK today and Stuart feels conflicted about the current state of affairs when it comes to equality. “There’s some institutions that have taken things on and tried to make changes,” he says. “But other institutions have placed their heads in the sand, and said, ‘It’s not us.’” He is scathing about the much-criticised 2021 Tony Sewell report, which was widely perceived to downplay the reality of institutional racism in British life. “[Sewell] came out and said: ‘There’s no problems, we’re fine, give yourself a pat on the back.’ That’s frustrating for me, when we’re not recognising and acknowledging the pain and anguish of people, and there’s a few people out there who believe if we don’t talk about it or complain about it too much, it’s all going to go away. I just feel like it’s Band-Aid time. Pull off the Band-Aid, look at the wound. It’s going to hurt for a while, it’s going to be uncomfortable, we can move on from it. But we’re going to need some brave people in powerful positions to make some choices that are going to upset a minority of people for the majority of people to succeed and move on.” Stuart has not ruled out running for parliament one day. “Sometimes you have to throw yourself into the mix,” he says coyly. What becomes evident from speaking with him is how a person becomes flattened in death – almost a caricature. So, to the general public, Stephen will forever be recognisable only from the photo distributed by police after his death. In it, he stands in front of a pot plant, a half-smile flickering around his eyes, fist balled into the solidarity fist. Like so much of Stephen’s identity, the photo was weaponised against him, used as evidence that he was a gang member, rather than a hip-hop-loving teenager paying homage to one of his favourite artists, the politically conscious rappers Public Enemy. Stuart remembers the moment the photo was taken. The family had been on a day out, and Doreen was finishing off the camera roll before taking it in for processing. She made the children line up against the wall, for photos. Stuart stood beside his big brother, whom he idolised and looked up to, and saw him do the power sign, and so he copied him, of course. “I didn’t really understand the poignancy and imagery and meaning behind it,” Stuart sighs. He understands it now. Silence is Not an Option: You Can Impact the World for Change by Stuart Lawrence is published by Scholastic at £14.99.

4/17/2022,"Anatomy of a Scandal | NetflixDerry Girls (Channel 4) | All 4Killing Eve (BBC One) | iPlayerGentleman Jack (BBC One) | iPlayer In a week in which yet another Tory MP is in the news over sexual assault allegations (that’s four in the past couple of years, by my count), Netflix’s much-hyped political thriller Anatomy of a Scandal debuts. It’s the latest drama to mix the high-stakes environments of law and politics while also throwing in some pretty fundamental questions on consent and class, social and sexual capital. It’s fiction – but you don’t have to look far beyond SW1 for myriad sources of inspiration. Adapted from Sarah Vaughan’s 2018 novel, it has pedigree names behind the camera, including former House of Cards showrunner Melissa James Gibson and David E Kelley, a writer I’ve loved since spending my teenage years watching box sets of Ally McBeal. This time, the action in the courtroom is much, much darker. Rupert Friend (Homeland) plays James Whitehouse, a government minister and best friend of the prime minister (Geoffrey Streatfeild, last seen playing an altogether different type of politician in The Thick of It). James has two kids with his beautiful wife, Sophie (Sienna Miller), who, we learn from flashbacks, he met when both were students at Oxford. We’re also jolted back in time to when James and the PM were both members of the university’s exclusive, raucous, restaurant-destroying posh boys club. Sound familiar? Unfortunately for James, this privileged life, which is all he’s ever known – “Whitehouses always come out on top!” is something he likes to chant with his children – is severely threatened when an affair with his parliamentary assistant is splashed across the front page of the Daily Mail. Soon, events take an even more serious turn. Enter Michelle Dockery’s bespectacled and bewigged prosecution QC sweeping bat-like through chambers. Miller – who I have liked since she was a) brilliant as Edie Sedgwick in Factory Girl, and b) forced to apologise for calling Pittsburgh “Shitsburgh” – is perfectly cast as a woman trying to make her way through the most paparazzi cameras seen outside a courthouse since Johnny Depp’s libel trial. But you get the sense that there’s a lot more to Sophie than her Le Creuset collection. Meanwhile, Friend’s eyebrows put in a typically talented performance, and they’re telling us their owner is not to be trusted. On the subject of significantly expressive facial features, Saoirse-Monica Jackson’s ability to rearrange hers as though she were doing a Rubik’s Cube is just one of the reasons Derry Girls has been the funniest show on television in the past few years. Inspired by creator Lisa McGee’s real-life teendom, when she attended a Catholic school in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, while also indulging in the very best of mid-90s pop culture, it has proved dramatically and comedically to be quite the combination. This third and final series opens with Erin, Clare, Orla, Michelle and, of course, cousin James, the Wee English Fella, awaiting their GCSE results and keeping busy by making a home video documentary that may or may not be in with an Oscars shout – if only aspiring writer Erin can brush up the script. Perhaps she should solicit advice from McGee, whose writing remains sublime. Nicola Coughlan’s perma-anxious Clare, worried about being led astray and failing her exams, says to Erin: “I was a scholar when I met you!” Erin: “You were three.” Expect big-name guest stars, thrilled to be a part of a show that has proved to be a masterpiece of pathos, humour and double denim. Oh, and please, for the love of Jesus, listen out for the revelation of Sister Michael’s full name. Also bowing out is Killing Eve, which burst on to our screens four years ago, after the kind of breathless buildup befitting a show about a Russian assassin on the run from the intelligence services. It was stylistically bold, sharp as a murder weapon (take your pick) and sizzled with the chemistry between then up-and-coming Jodie Comer as Villanelle and Sandra Oh as Eve Polastri. It’s perhaps because Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the writer of series one (who has remained an executive producer throughout), set the bar so high that some measure of disappointment inevitably followed. While maintaining flashes of brilliance and the darkly comic set pieces that are the show’s forte, series two and three felt uneven because of the changing roster of head writers. This final fourth series sees the net closing in on the Twelve, the shady syndicate responsible for more spilt blood than an arterial haemorrhage. Covid filming restrictions have given the whole series a more low-key feel: fuchsia tulle dresses and Venetian apartments out, yellow anoraks and mountain bothies in. But emotionally, everything in this grand finale is full throttle. And there hasn’t been a television snog so desperately anticipated as the one between Eve and Villanelle since Tim and Dawn locked lips in The Office. A lot happens. A lot happens. People are already moaning about it on the internet. Speaking of desperate anticipation, I may be hankering for the third series of the brilliant Sally Wainwright’s Happy Valley (it’s been six years!), but in the meantime I’ll settle for the rollicking 19th-century escapades of Anne Lister in Gentleman Jack. Fresh from unveiling a Halifax statue of the eponymous character, Suranne Jones is back in her dapper waistcoat, only to take it off whenever steaming up mahogany bedrooms. Series two begins with Anne’s paramour, er, Ann (speaking from experience, dual names are an unfortunate same-sex couple hazard), having moved into Shibden Hall after their makeshift nuptials. This bodes well for a more settled love life for our favourite fourth-wall-breaking diarist – but as Eve and Villanelle can attest, the course of true love never did run smooth. Julia(Sky Atlantic/Now TV)Sarah Lancashire plays the American chef and author Julia Child, who transfixed the US in the 1960s with her pioneering TV cookery show The French Chef, in this new eight-part HBI drama. Child is much less well known in the UK, but Lancashire is as watchable as ever, and steers away from what could have been a kitsch performance played for laughs. Thatcher & Reagan: A Very Special Relationship(BBC Two)Following on from a clutch of successful Beeb political documentaries (Blair & Brown: The New Labour Revolution is still available on iPlayer) Charles Moore, former Telegraph and Spectator editor, presents this one. It’s all a bit of a love-in, but worth watching for insight from the likes of Malcolm Rifkind and Bernard Ingham, and, of course, Moore himself.

4/17/2022,"Nina Stibbe’s Love, Nina (2013) was a disarming, intelligent and hugely entertaining memoir based on being a nanny for the children of Mary-Kay Wilmers, the former editor of the London Review of Books, and records encounters with Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, Karel Reisz and assorted literary others. Stibbe followed this with three buoyantly comic and successful novels based on her own life, and is about to publish a delightful fourth, One Day I Shall Astonish the World, her first attempt at fiction with no autobiographical strings attached, about a bumpy friendship between dissimilar women. She is 60 and lives in Cornwall with her husband and two grownup children. Your new novel made me laugh out loud. Are you good at cheering yourself up?I’m not bad at laughing at awful things. I grew up with four close siblings and we laughed at everything. Once, when Mum had gone off for a day to have an operation, we brought the horse inside and it made a mess and broke some furniture – and Mum was furious with us, so furious she burst into tears which just made us howl laughing and then made her laugh. Dad died recently and I accidentally played his funeral music in hospital while he was dying. We were talking about what music he might like and I went on Spotify and started playing his death music – and then I thought: poor man, he’ll think he’s already dead. It was Schubert’s moving String Quintet in C major. In what way has becoming a successful writer changed your life?I grew up in a booky household. My parents, who were divorced, were both book lovers. And for many of my formative years I was living quite nonchalantly among the high-achieving people who featured in my first book. Being successful hasn’t been a shock – because I’ve seen it – even though I’ve always been very ordinary. Love, Nina was discovered by accident, and because Alan Bennett was a central figure it got published, adored and noted. Without him I don’t think we’d be having this conversation. What reaction have you had from Mary-Kay Wilmers and other friends to your success? Was there retrospective surprise about having housed a real writer disguised as a nanny?When I look back, I think they were far more interested in me than I was in them. They liked the real world. They still do. They know they live in this slightly removed world, so when the plumber or nanny turns up, they’re genuinely fascinated. I’d no interest in Alan Bennett writing cutting-edge television or Mary-Kay being this extraordinary editor, I was only interested in me – and so were they. So it was rather good. Mary-Kay would say: “I hope you’re going to write a novel.” I’d read a few good novels. Edna O’Brien was a favourite. I remember thinking: “God, she’s just written about ordinary people … I could do that.” But I’d say to Mary-Kay: “I never will, I’ve not got a big enough vocabulary.” She was always encouraging, whereas Alan Bennett has been a bit … he was a bit grumpy that he wasn’t sexier in the book instead of constantly talking about rice pudding. In between being a nanny and a novelist, what other jobs have you had?I left school at 15. I’ve been a dental nurse, a book sales rep for the Open University, I’ve worked in marketing for Harcourt Brace and was a commissioning editor at Routledge. In Cornwall I became a primary school teaching assistant. I did that for two years thinking I might become a teacher – but realised I never could: nothing is as hard as teaching. What sort of an observer are you?I write everything down, all the time. I’m working on my next novel and it’s like making a soup – you make the stock tastier and tastier… Your novel dwells on the ticklish nature of female friendship. Growing up, did you have a best friend?I had a bunch of really awful friends. I loved them but they were horrible. And I wasn’t very nice to them. I used to think it was because I had loads of siblings so it didn’t matter if I didn’t respect my friends. In fiction, female friendships are either ridiculously saintly or psychopathic … In real life they are neither. Women hang on to friends and don’t just have a friend for ping pong. They have friendships that are embedded and enmeshed. I loved your account of Roy, the narrator’s husband, as a health bore. How healthy are you?I’ve recently become a pilates bore … I’m healthy in that I live in Cornwall and am constantly hiking up mountains and down cliffs, walking my dog and swimming in cold water, but I don’t bore on about cold water swimming because people hate that … We are all jealous, aren’t we? I’m always jealous of people going to the theatre or ballet or doing other lovely things. I noticed, in your acknowledgments, that you thank your husband for letting you have another dog?I’m a dog lover but he is not. I did sneakily get a dog nine years ago. I’ve always wanted to get another, so for the last two books I’ve thanked him for the second dog he hasn’t as yet agreed to. Our dog, Peggy, is a cockapoo. I always pretend she is a rescue dog and say we found her running in a blizzard on the A30 in Devon but people say: “There wasn’t a blizzard …” Actually, we bought her for £650 from a woman in Barnstable (not a puppy farm). I will rescue the next one. Why did you move to Cornwall?We moved here when we had a two-year-old and a baby. We’d been living in a tiny flat in Crouch End and thought: why are we living in London? We came to Cornwall because my husband loves surfing so much. By the time we were ready to come back to London we couldn’t afford it. You’ve grownup children now. What is your top parenting tip?Not to make everything a learning experience. How freaked out were you by the pandemic?I drove to get my daughter from Central Saint Martins in London and she cried all the way home. My son was in his first year doing politics and economics at Queen Mary [University of London]. He is not a rule breaker and would be in the halls of residence kitchen making a lentil dal, on the phone to me, night after night. He was so lonely. And I was in the middle of this novel, which I’d decided to write over an academic year. When Covid happened I thought: I didn’t design these characters to cope with a global pandemic, but then realised: they’ve got to go through it… How do you feel about having turned 60?Mentally, I’m 12. I really want to grow up and be more mature in my outlook. I’ve never been the adult in the room – I just haven’t. If you had a magic wand, what would you do with it?I’d give everyone a magic wand but they’d have to check in with me before they magicked anything. But world peace is the only true answer to that question.  One Day I Shall Astonish the World by Nina Stibbe is published by Viking (£14.99).

4/17/2022,"Idon’t know that I expected a caesarean section to be a spontaneous or improvisational exercise, but the orderliness of the occasion in Homerton University Hospital’s delivery suite was still remarkable. I’m bad with numbers, but I seem to remember there being roughly 140 people in the room, all working at their tasks independently, in that unlikely way ice skaters have of bisecting each other’s paths without clattering into one another. Through it all, my heart was trembling, facing for the first time the terror I’d held there for over a year. Shortly before Christmas 2020, my wife was rushed to hospital in Dublin with a suspected miscarriage. Covid protocols meant we were turned away on account of having been in Northern Ireland the previous week, before it became clear that what we’d thought was a miscarriage was actually an ectopic pregnancy. A fertilised egg had implanted, not in her womb, but in her fallopian tube. As it grew, it caused a tear and as she struggled to remain upright on the hospital steps, it ruptured, causing 2 litres of blood to fill the gap. Action stations were staffed, ashen-faced doctors rushed her to theatre, where the internal bleeding was so severe that the words ‘close to death’ and ‘20 minutes to live’ were repeated by almost all of the staff we met in the days that followed. Suddenly, ‘if’ was the only word in my vocabulary. If we’d been admitted 20 minutes later; if this rupture had happened on the plane we’d been on a week earlier; if the Dublin traffic which had delayed our trip to the hospital that afternoon had presented us with just one more, interminable traffic jam. The grief of baby loss is the pain of missing something you’ve never even got to hold. The physical and emotional toll this event took on my wife, the strongest, most resilient person I know, served as a quiet, needling counterpoint to all our little hopes for the next year, as the word ‘trying’ lived up to two meanings. When we were lucky enough to get pregnant this time, we held that little hope in our hands like a baby bird, never quite daring to believe things would work out again. And then, scan after scan, we nourished that belief into something more solid until we realised we were no longer hoping, but expecting. And now, here we were again in a different hospital, surrounded by doctors, and midwives, only they weren’t ashen-faced and grim, but calm and kind. Calm in that way that burns a tired eye. Kind in that way that makes you want to melt down all your possessions so you can build a statue for every last one of them. They’d hardly started before the sheet was lowered, and my daughter raised above it to say hello, giving proceedings the cheery incongruity of a gory little puppet show. As she was handed to me, my eyes burst like those rubberised bath pellets young girls used to gift each other in the 90s, but which no one has seen or heard from since. My head swam as a tiny hand gripped my finger, and small black eyes gazed back at my own. All of hope, of life, of joy, was held now in my arms.
