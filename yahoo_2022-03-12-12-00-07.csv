3/12/2022,"By Michael Holden, Praveen Menon and Karl Plume (Reuters) - Japanese brands Uniqlo and Japan Tobacco made U-turns and said they were stopping business in Russia, joining the corporate crowd shunning Moscow on Thursday, and Britain escalated sanctions against oligarchs including Chelsea soccer club owner Roman Abramovich. Investment bank Goldman Sachs became the first U.S. bank to quit Russia, and global grain trader Bunge said it had suspended new export business from Russia, although it is still crushing oil seeds for the domestic market.. Russian President Vladimir Putin said that his country would emerge stronger and more independent from Western sanctions, which he said were inevitable. The corporate condemnation of Russia's attack on Ukraine is spreading, but Putin, who calls the war a special military operation, said he had no choice. The fallout is also broadening among Putin's personal allies, as Abramovich and six others including Igor Sechin, CEO of Russian energy giant Rosneft, became the highest-profile oligarchs sanctioned by Britain since the invasion. The action effectively puts Chelsea under UK government control, halting any disposal, and stopping new ticket or merchandise sales. Britain's move came as the first major mining company, Rio Tinto, said it is cutting all ties with Russian businesses, including fuel and other materials' sources for its Mongolian copper operations at Oyu Tolgoi, where possible, and the use of an alumina refinery in Ireland. Japan's Sony and Nintendo suspended deliveries of their gaming consoles; Sony's music businesses and Warner Music Group also stopped business in Russia. HOTELIERS STEP BACK Major fast-food, drinks and consumer goods companies, led by McDonalds and Coca-Cola, have stepped back from Russia following pressure from customers in the West. Hotelier Marriott International closed its Moscow office and joined Hilton and Hyatt in suspending developments. The exodus by Japanese companies picked up steam, with many describing the decisions in practical terms. Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing had told Japanese media that the company would continue operating its 50 stores in Russia because ""clothing is a necessity of life,"" but on Thursday the company said it could not continue business in Russia because of ""a number of difficulties."" Japan Tobacco, which controls about one-third of Russia's tobacco market, said its subsidiary would stop investment, marketing and a launch of a heated tobacco product. Japan's Shiseido suspended exports of its cosmetics to Russia from Europe as well as advertising and promotions, and Mitsubishi Electric said it would stop exports to Russia, where operations were in a ""difficult situation"". Japanese construction machinery supplier Hitachi said it would stop exports and cease most operations in Russia except for vital electrical power facilities, following similar exits by American industrial companies Caterpillar, 3M Co, Deere and Honeywell. ""We took multiple factors including the supply chain situation into account,"" a spokesperson for Hitachi said, echoing a statement from Caterpillar. While some companies such as Ford and Apple have condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, others including Japanese automaker Toyota have taken a more neutral stance, blaming a halt in production in Russia on logistical hurdles. Swiss bank Credit Suisse flagged a roughly $900 million Russian credit exposure, including lending to wealthy clients, following disclosures from Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas. Suzuki's Hungarian factory suspended car exports to Russia and Ukraine, about 10,000 vehicles a year, in one of the first signs of the conflict hitting the broader economy in the region. Sweeping Western sanctions have isolated Russia, while shippers have suspended routes and European Union leaders plan to phase out buying Russian energy in a bid to be less dependent on the country. The war, which entered its third week on Thursday, has killed thousands of people and rendered more than two million refugees. It has decimated the Russian rouble, roiled stock markets and prices of oil and other commodities have skyrocketed, adding to global inflation that was surging even before the conflict began. Alphabet Inc's YouTube and Google Play store are suspending all payment-based services in Russia, including subscriptions, as sanctions start to pose banking challenges. They had earlier stopped selling online ads in Russia. PAY IN ROUBLES Russia plans to order local airlines to pay for leased aircraft in roubles and bar them from returning planes to foreign companies if the latter cancel the lease, according to a draft law published on Thursday. Lessor BOC Aviation said it had 18 planes worth $935 million leased to Russian airlines that could be affected by the sanctions and insurance policy cancellations. Moscow, which calls the war a ""special military operation,"" has warned it might nationalise idled foreign assets in retaliation against Western sanctions. Rio Tinto, which owns an 80% stake in a joint venture with Russian aluminium producer Rusal, said it was ""in the process of terminating all commercial relationships it has with any Russian business."" Italian energy group Eni suspended the purchase of oil from Russia and said it was watching developments closely with regards to gas procurement.

3/12/2022,"A couple of weeks ago, all three of the killers involved in the 2020 death of Ahmaud Abrery were convicted of federal hate crimes. Now two of the killers, Travis McMichael and his father Greg McMichael are looking for an acquittal of their federal hate crimes convictions, according to CNN.
 The father and son, who both filed separate motions for judgments of acquittal on all the federal charges, are arguing that the killing of the 25-year-old Black man did not happen on public streets and that the government did not give enough evidence for them to be convicted.

Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce According to CNN, court records show that William R. Bryan, the third man convicted in the killing of Arbery, has not filed a motion since the federal hate crimes trial ended. The three men had 14 days after the verdicts were issued on February 22 to file post-trial motions. From CNN: In the 43-page appeal for an acquittal, attorneys for Travis McMichael used the first 33-pages to argue the government did not sufficiently prove that Arbery was running on a public street. Federal civil rights laws prohibits the willful harm or intimidation of people in public spaces based on their race. The McMichaels, who were armed, were in one vehicle, while Bryan, who joined while the chase was underway, followed in his own truck, assisting in and recording the chase. Arbery was unarmed. Defense attorneys argued the McMichaels pursued Arbery in a pickup truck to stop him for police because they suspected him of committing a crime, and that Travis McMichael shot Arbery in self-defense as they wrestled over McMichael’s shotgun. The motion stated that the testimony only showed the neighborhood’s “developer offered to dedicate the Satilla Shores neighborhood streets to the county, but the county did not expressly or implicitly accept that offer,” according to the court documents. Prosecutors have not yet filed a response with the court, according to CNN. Greg McMichael’s motion claimed that there was not any evidence that he went after Arbery because of the color of his skin, in reference to the interference of rights convictions. The motion also said that there was no evidence that Greg used the n-word or any other racial slurs. More from CNN: The government “failed to supply the jury with any evidence that Defendant Gregory McMichael associated African Americans with criminality,” even though “it is true that the Government admitted evidence and testimony demonstrating that defendants Travis McMichael and William Bryan may have associated African Americans with the commission of crime,” according to the motion.

3/12/2022,"LVIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia's airplanes and artillery widened their assault on Ukraine on Friday, striking airfields in the west and a major industrial hub in the east, as Moscow's forces tried to regroup from recent losses and their onslaught fast reduced crowded cities to rubble. American intelligence officials offered an assessment of the Russian air campaign, estimating that invading pilots are averaging 200 sorties a day, compared with five to 10 for Ukrainian forces, which are focusing more on surface-to-air missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and drones to take out Russian aircraft. New commercial satellite images appeared to capture artillery firing on residential areas between Russian forces and the capital. The images from Maxar Technologies showed muzzle flashes and smoke from the big guns, as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, outside Kyiv, the company said. In a devastated village east of the capital, villagers climbed over toppled walls and flapping metal strips in the remnants of a pool hall, restaurant and theater freshly blown apart by Russian bombs. Russian President Vladimir Putin “created this mess, thinking he will be in charge here,” 62-year-old Ivan Merzyk said. In temperatures sinking below freezing, villagers quickly spread plastic wrap or nailed plywood over blown out windows of their homes. “We are not going away from here,” Merzyk said. On the economic and political front, the U.S. and its allies moved to further isolate and sanction the Kremlin. President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. will dramatically downgrade its trade status with Russia and also ban imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds. The move to revoke Russia's “most favored nation” status was taken in coordination with the European Union and Group of Seven countries. “The free world is coming together to confront Putin,” Biden said. On the ground, Russia's forces appeared to be trying to regroup and regain momentum after encountering heavier losses and stiffer resistance than anticipated over the past two weeks. Britain's Ministry of Defense said Russia is trying to “re-set and re-posture” its troops, gearing up for operations against Kyiv. “It’s ugly already, but it’s going to get worse,” said Nick Reynolds, a warfare analyst at Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank. With the invasion in its 16th day, Putin said there had been “certain positive developments” in Russia-Ukraine talks, but gave no details. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed Ukrainian forces had “reached a strategic turning point,"" though he did not elaborate. “It’s impossible to say how many days we will still need to free our land, but it is possible to say that we will do it,"" he said via video from Kyiv. Zelenskyy said authorities were working on establishing 12 humanitarian corridors and trying to ensure food, medicine and other basics get to people across the country. Thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been killed in the invasion, along with Ukrainian civilians. He accused Russia of kidnapping the mayor of one city, Melitopol, calling the abduction “a new stage of terror.” The Biden administration, citing American intelligence but no evidence, warned before the invasion of Russian plans to detain and kill targeted people in Ukraine. Zelenskyy himself would be a likely top target. So far, the Russians have made the biggest advances on cities in the east and south while struggling in the north and around Kyiv. Russia said it used high-precision long-range weapons to put military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk in the west “out of action.” The attack on Lutsk killed four Ukrainian servicemen, the mayor said. Russian airstrikes also targeted for the first time Dnipro, a major industrial hub in the east and Ukraine’s fourth-largest city, with about 1 million people. One person was killed, Ukrainian officials said. In images of the aftermath released by Ukraine’s emergency agency, firefighters doused a flaming building, and ash fell on bloodied rubble. Smoke billowed over shattered concrete where buildings once stood. The bombardment continued in Mariupol, where a deadly strike on a maternity hospital this week sparked international outrage and war-crime allegations. Unrelenting attacks have thwarted repeated attempts to send in food and medicine and evacuate civilians from Mariupol, a city of 430,000. In a statement, the Mariupol mayor's office said Friday that the toll of people killed during the now 12-day siege had risen to 1,582. In the face of the unrelenting bombing, “the dead aren't even being buried,"" the mayor's office said. Elsewhere, temperatures were forecast to hit -13 degrees Celsius (8 Fahrenheit) in the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has come under heavy bombardment. About 400 apartment buildings in Kharkiv lost heat, and Mayor Ihor Terekhov appealed to remaining residents to descend into the subway or other underground shelters where blankets and hot food were being distributed. The latest assaults came a day after satellite photos appeared to show that the huge armored column that was stalled for over a week outside Kyiv had spread out near the capital. Military analysts were divided over whether the maneuvering by the Russian convoy signaled the imminent start of a siege of Kyiv or was just an effort to disperse some vehicles to more protected positions. The photos showed howitzers newly set up in firing position, and armored units staged near the Antonov Airport north of the city, according to Maxar. Americans point instead to other forces that are moving toward Kyiv from the northeast and are now about 20 to 30 kilometers (about 10 to 20 miles) east of the city center. Hundreds of miles to the south of Kyiv, at Mykolaiv, shelling damaged a cancer hospital, according to the head doctor, Maksim Beznosenko. No one was killed. The United Nations says it has verified 26 attacks on medical centers, medical workers or ambulances since the invasion began, with 12 people killed. The U.N. political chief said Friday that the international organization had received credible reports that Russian forces were using cluster bombs in populated areas. The bombs scatter smaller explosives over a wide area and are prohibited in cities and towns under international law. Russians and Ukrainians have held multiple rounds of talks near the Belarus border, and the two countries' foreign ministers met again Thursday with no apparent progress. Various third countries have also made attempts to broker a stop to the fighting. Some 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the United Nations. ___ Associated Press journalists Felipe Dana and Andrew Drake in Kyiv, Ukraine, along with other reporters around the world contributed. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"Russian warplanes, artillery widen attack, hit industry hub",https://news.yahoo.com/photos-appear-show-breakup-40-052204722.html
3/12/2022,"By Howard Schneider WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The gusher of money the U.S. government poured into family bank accounts during the coronavirus pandemic, credited with speeding the rebound from the health crisis, may now help limit the economic damage from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and give the Federal Reserve more leeway in raising interest rates. As analysts have begun parsing what sky-high oil prices and new uncertainty might mean, a common theme has emerged: U.S. consumers may get gouged at the gas pump but will likely be able to maintain much of their expected spending on other goods and services due to savings accumulated out of COVID-19 pandemic spending programs that have totaled about $5 trillion. The war in Ukraine is a shock, they note, but one the United States may have unintentionally insured itself against. ""Household savings could help consumers maintain spending volumes in the face of related price increases,"" JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver wrote this week, noting that each 10% increase in oil prices would cost consumers an additional $23 billion each year. Households ""have accumulated about $2.6 trillion of 'excess saving' in recent years relative to the pre-pandemic trend, which all else equal could be enough to cover even a sustained 50% surge in oil and natural gas prices for many years to come,"" Silver wrote. Graphic: Oxford Economics Recovery Index : https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/OXFORDINDEX/jznvnyedlpl/chart.png U.S. consumer price data released on Thursday showed the pace of annual price increases jumped to 7.9% last month from 7.5% in January. The increase was driven by energy and food costs, but still did not reflect the brunt of commodity price increases seen in the two weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine. The month-to-month pace of price increases among some key goods declined, a development Fed officials have been hoping for as they look for signs that overall inflation would begin to moderate. But given the uncertainty flowing from the conflict in Ukraine, the U.S. central bank is likely to keep a wary eye on inflation. Between the higher cost of oil and a consumer price index rising at the fastest pace since the early 1980s, investors now expect the Fed will raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by 1.75 percentage points this year. That would mean a quarter-percentage-point increase at each of its seven remaining policy meetings in 2022. The next meeting is March 15-16. ""The Ukraine/Russia conflict threatens to disrupt the Fed’s tightening plans this year,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. ""But ... The Fed cannot afford to wait and see how financial conditions respond to the geopolitical conflict."" The United States and its Western allies responded to the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine with punishing sanctions on Russia, the world's largest exporter of oil and oil products combined, adding to the updraft in oil prices. The price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude briefly hit $130 a barrel, from around $92 before the conflict, and was trading at $111 on Thursday. The average U.S. price for regular unleaded gasoline has hit a record $4.25 a gallon, though that is about $1 a gallon below the inflation-adjusted peak. While that indicates inflation likely has further to climb, it's less clear what it will mean both for the Fed, as it debates how fast to raise interest rates, and for the U.S. economy as it emerges from the pandemic. Some prior oil shocks, such as the one in the 1970s, were associated with more persistent inflation that prompted the U.S. central bank to react with aggressive rate increases. Others, such as the brief spike during the Gulf War in the early 1990s, came alongside Fed rate cuts because underlying inflation was expected to ease. SIGNS OF SUBSTITUTION, NOT PULLBACK The U.S. economy may have some room to give. Growth entering the year was strong, and even if high oil prices slow things, the outcome for the year is still likely to be solid - not the weak growth and rising prices of a true ""stagflation."" ""The U.S. has become less sensitive to energy shocks,"" with a steady decline in the share of income spent on energy, Bank of America economists wrote in a note. ""With Omicron cases fading, the reopening of the service sector has resumed ... Excess savings built up over the last two years can fund this rebound."" Graphic: Energy's share of U.S. consumer spending: https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/USA-CONSUMPTION/jnvwebrqwvw/chart.png Research on past oil shocks offers a sense of what to expect. Even as gas prices rise, fuel consumption and driving tend to remain steady, partly out of necessity - the daily commute, driving on the job, or family chores - as well as choice. Household budgets then adapt. One 2008 study of periods when gas prices were high found increased bargain shopping at grocery stores and substitution into cheaper brands. One possible bellwether of such a move: Shares of discount retail chain Dollar General Corp have risen about 9% since the Ukraine war began, outpacing the broader market. Nik Modi, a tobacco and household products analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said there was already evidence in late February before the invasion that smokers were trading down to cheaper cigarettes, a trend he expects to continue as gas prices rise. Pump prices had risen nearly 30 cents a gallon from the start of the year to when Russia invaded. They're up another 70 cents since. Yet high frequency restaurant and travel data so far shows little evidence of consumers pulling back. PANDEMIC BEHAVIOR CHANGES Corporate officials who might otherwise expect fallout from higher gas prices said they were hopeful this time will be different. Some studies have found rising gas prices cause families to at least delay larger purchases, but ""the effect of that might be somewhat more muted in this environment than maybe it has historically,"" David Denton, the chief financial officer of home improvement chain Lowe's Cos Inc's, said at the UBS Global Consumer and Retail conference on Wednesday. ""In the past, when gas prices have gone up, demand in this sector has kind of gone down a little bit,"" Denton said, but working from home in particular may have insulated consumers who previously commuted to work. Other pandemic dynamics may also play out. Public transit use remains depressed but could be an acceptable option for former riders as COVID-19 infections decrease. Credit card balances are lower, giving financial space to consumers intent on spending now that social life has resumed more fully. In addition, economists and officials have noted that higher oil prices now have some potential upside in the United States, with the hit to consumers offset by rising employment and investment in domestic energy production. ""Oil prices would need to rise much further from here to seriously threaten the consumer recovery,"" wrote Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics. ""For the broader economy, any hit to consumption should be mostly offset by greater investment in shale production."" Pearce said there may even be some unintended benefits for the Fed. If rising gas prices do curb consumer demand for some goods and services, it could ease inflation by bringing demand closer in line with available supply. ""To the extent this means domestic demand is weaker, we should be seeing less upward pressure on wages and services prices,"" Pearce said.

3/12/2022,"When Russian forces bombed a maternity clinic in the war-torn Ukrainian city of Mariupol on Wednesday, they first insisted the facility was a Ukrainian military outpost and, as such, a fair target in the two-week-old, senseless war. But on Thursday, the Russian Embassy in the U.K. sought to take things one step further, tweeting out a photo of woman who has become the poster person of the atrocity—a young, blonde, heavily pregnant woman in maternity pajamas, wrapped in a dirty blanket with blood dripping down her face. The embassy tried to insinuate that the woman—who has been identified as blogger Marianna Podgurskaya, according to one of the many photographers who took her photo crawling out of the rubble, and whose open Instagram account @gixie_beauty has chronicled her pregnancy—was a crisis actor. “She actually played roles of both pregnant women on the photos,” the Russian embassy tweeted, going on to say the first photo was taken by Evgeniy Maloletka, a freelance photographer and filmmaker who has been risking his life to chronicle the Russian invasion of Ukraine since the beginning—and whom Russia considers a provocateur. The embassy neglected to mention how many other photographers, including Associated Press photographer Mstyslav Chernov, also photographed the traumatized blogger, whose life was threatened in the attack that killed three people. The Daily Beast has reached out to Podgurskaya for comment and it is unclear how her late-term pregnancy is progressing after the attack. Immediately, the darkest fringes of the internet’s conspiracy web latched onto the suggestion that a pregnant woman from Mariupol, who has an online presence and is a known blogger, would not be in a maternity hospital in the 39th week of her pregnancy. 4Chan and other deep-web cesspits have also embraced the fact that she’s famous and recognizable as a reason she couldn’t have been in a maternity ward in her hometown. “Yes, she is pregnant, but she wasn’t there of course, she’s a local beauty-blogger,” one 4Chan poster wrote. The clearly fake information is bad enough, but naming her like this is more than enough to boot the embassy's account off of the platform. As if her and her unborn child nearly dying isn't bad enough, she'll likely be harassed for years now because of this accusation. — Aric Toler (@AricToler) March 10, 2022 Hours later, Twitter removed the Russian Embassy’s tweets on Podgurskaya, telling the BBC it was “in violation of the Twitter Rules, specifically our Hateful Conduct and Abusive Behavior policies related to the denial of violent events.” Unable to control the narrative of the increasingly hostile war, Russian diplomats are going to other extreme lengths, including to fight with journalists as well. The Russian Defense ministry also ridiculously claimed the “so-called ‘airstrike’” was a “fully staged provocation” to support “anti-Russian fervor among Western audience.” And on the sidelines of the meeting in Turkey between Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, CNN correspondent Jomana Karadsheh got into a lively debate with Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova over what was reported to be doctored footage of the bombing at the maternity clinic. Karadsheh asked the spokeswoman if she had a comment about the bombing and the documented evidence of injured pregnant women and children. Zakharova called it a “fake provocation” and tried to shove her own phone with apparently doctored video into the journalist’s view.

Kakharova then went off on a tangent, accusing Western journalists of being “blind” to alleged Ukraine aggression over the last eight years. Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?
