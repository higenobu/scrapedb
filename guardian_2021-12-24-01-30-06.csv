12/24/2021,"Only six people in the world have won the 100m dash in back-to-back Olympic Games. The first was Wyomia Tyus in 1964 and 1968. Next was Carl Lewis, then Gail Devers, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Usain Bolt (who won three times in a row), and Elaine Thompson-Herah. To many people, the name Wyomia Tyus is less familiar than the others. Tyus was not only the first Olympian to win back-to-back gold in its prestige event – she also made history in other ways. At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, when Tyus crossed the line first in the 100 meters, she set a world record of 11.08 seconds. And when she ran, she was wearing dark shorts instead of the team-issued white shorts, a gesture to show her support for human rights.  “I was not doing it for any type of glory or anything,” Tyus says. “It was just for me as a person, as a human being, and my feelings and what I thought about what was going on in the world, and how women – Black women especially – were treated.” Tyus grew up in Griffin, Georgia, in the Jim Crow South and became one of the Tigerbelles, a track and field powerhouse coached by Ed Temple at Tennessee State University. In Mexico City, two days after Tyus’s win in the 100 meters, John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the podium in what became an iconic image. They were swiftly escorted out of the Olympic Village and sent home for their protest. Tyus also won gold in the 4x100 meter relay, and she dedicated her win to Carlos and Smith. No one really picked up on Tyus’s own demonstration, and she didn’t talk about why she wore the dark blue (almost black) shorts. “They didn’t care about what I did, because I was a woman and I was Black,” she says. Leading up to the 1968 Olympics, the Olympic Project for Human Rights discussed ways athletes might demonstrate. But Tyus says she and the Tigerbelles weren’t included in the plans or asked if they were on board. “No one came to us. The whole movement started, and it was more like, ‘Well, this is what we say, and the women are going to follow,’” she says. “I don’t know if those words were spoken, but those are the words I felt.” So Tyus decided on her own to wear her dark shorts. “I grew up with colored bathrooms, colored water fountains, all those kinds of things. It’s not like I did not know how unfair things were happening to Black people, and especially women,” she says. Martha Watson, a four-time Olympian between 1964 and 1976, was one of Tyus’s Tigerbelle teammates. She remembers other members of the 1968 US team talking about plans to demonstrate if they made it to the medals stand. “We knew what was going on,” Watson says. “I mean, we lived it. I grew up in California, and I went to school in Tennessee. I could go shopping, but I couldn’t try clothes on in Tennessee. That was a rude awakening for me.” People who follow track and field know the names of Tommie Smith and John Carlos – as well as Lewis, Devers, Fraser-Pryce, Bolt, and Thompson-Herah. When Lewis won back-to-back gold in the 100 meters in 1984 and 1988, Tyus remembers people celebrating him for being the first, overlooking her achievement two decades earlier. Why did society skip over her? Maybe people just weren’t paying attention to women’s track in the ‘60s. But that’s not the only reason, Tyus says. “Are they going to give a Black woman that kind of power, to be the first one to do this, ever – in the history of the Olympic Games?” she says. “I mean, I go there with that.” At the time, women – especially Black women – were expected to “just sit back and be quiet, and don’t say very much,” says Tyus’s Tigerbelle teammate and 1964 Olympian Edith McGuire, who came in second to Tyus in the 100 meters. She also won gold in the 200 meters and silver in the 4x100 relay with Tyus. At the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, McGuire recalls that the coach of the US men’s team wasn’t going to let the women use the starting blocks designated for the US sprinters. Temple was coaching the women’s team, and he had to fight for them to be able to use the blocks, she says. Tyus and McGuire were both from Georgia. After the Olympics, they were honored with a parade through Atlanta, but it only went through the Black neighborhoods. Despite being Olympic champions, both were slighted for being Black, for being women, or both. “To me, Wyomia has still not gotten the due that she should have for winning back-to-back 100 meters in the ‘64 and ‘68 Olympics,” McGuire says. “If she was a man or a white woman, then I think it would have been totally different.” Even in the history of women’s track, among other Black women, Tyus seems to get overlooked. “When people think of female athletes in track and field, Wilma Rudolph is the only person they remember, or FloJo [Florence Griffith Joyner]. There’s a big void in between,” Watson says. She says part of the reason may be that “Tyus was never really flamboyant--she just went out there and did what she had to do.” “I am still surprised that she has to blow her own horn,” Watson says. “Skeeter [Rudolph] didn’t have to do that. FloJo didn’t have to do that.” Tyus grew up on a dairy farm, playing all kinds of sports with her three older brothers, even though girls weren’t really supposed to do that. For girls, “It was a ‘You can go outside and play, but don’t sweat’ kind of thing,” she says. “I wanted to be as good as my brothers, if not better.… In order to play with them and the other boys in the neighborhood, I had to be good. I had to be able to hold my own.” When she was a teenager, her house burned down, and her father died not long after. Tyus had been close to her father, and after his death, she withdrew and didn’t talk much. That’s when she turned to running track. “I was brokenhearted and depressed, and I was not doing anything. My mom kept saying, ‘You know, your dad would not want this. He would like to see you do something with your life,’” she says. “It was more something to do, and also get my mom off my back.” One summer, Temple invited her to a track camp at Tennessee State. Before then, she hadn’t realized she was very good at track, because another girl at her high school always beat her, she says. “That summer, the camp pretty much changed my life,” she says. “It changed the way I looked at myself. I thought maybe I could go to college – because my mom could not send me to college.” The opportunities available to Black women were pretty much limited to becoming a teacher or a nurse, she recalls. Tennessee State gave Tyus a scholarship – a path Temple created for many women who wouldn’t have been able to afford college, Tyus says. Temple’s team consistently developed Olympic champions, including Wilma Rudolph. More than 40 Tigerbelles competed at the Olympics from the ‘50s to the ‘80s, and they won 23 medals. “The whole relay team in 1960 was from Tennessee State,” Tyus points out. Watson says of the Tigerbelles: “I think it’s probably one of the most special things that’s happened with women in sports, and Black women also.” Tyus wrote a memoir called Tigerbelle, in part to celebrate what Temple had done for women who otherwise could not have gone to college. “To convince an HBCU to do this for Black women – he never really got the credit for it. All the things he’s done – he gave all of us chances,” Tyus says. The Tigerbelles were like a sisterhood that has endured through the decades, McGuire says. She and Tyus also developed a close friendship with Temple up until his death in 2016. “He called Wyomia and I the gold dust twins,” McGuire says. Whenever she and Tyus went back to Tennessee State, they’d visit Temple. “We would sit in his living room and talk like three little old biddies.” Although Tyus’s quiet demonstration in 1968 and historic Olympic wins never garnered much public attention, she still paved the way for today’s athlete activists to demonstrate against injustices. It’s not that women weren’t speaking out in previous decades, Tyus says. “Nobody was putting the mic in front of their face to let them talk,” she says. “But now, women have a platform, and people are seeing them totally differently. I think Title IX has a lot to do with that, too.” In recent years, many athletes – particularly Black women – have used their platform to advocate for change. Tyus points to the WNBA. “They were out front before anybody. ... They wanted to reach the masses of people to say, ‘Hey, look, this is what’s happening, we need to make a change.’” In track and field, Gwen Berry and Raven Saunders have advocated for human rights, including racial justice. Berry echoed Carlos and Smith’s protest when she raised her fist on the podium at the 2019 Pan American Games. She was reprimanded and put on probation by the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee, which has since changed its rules. But the International Olympic Committee still prohibits athletes from raising a fist on the podium. In some ways, today’s athletes are advocating for the same issues Tyus did in 1968. “The changes are happening, but they may not be happening fast enough,” Tyus says. “My dad used to say, ‘You always have to stay in the fight,’” Tyus says. “I have tried to maintain that. And I think that all the women, from Gwen Berry on – they are standing for things that will make this a better world in which to live for everybody, not just for one group of people.” And that fight can take different forms, as Tyus has shown, McGuire says. “You don’t always have to be boisterous,” she says. “No one should say, ‘Well, you didn’t get out there and raise your fist.’ Maybe that’s not my way. My way would be different. Everybody should do whatever they want to do in their own way.” After the Olympics, Tyus was part of a group of women, along with Billie Jean King, who helped establish the Women’s Sports Foundation. They connected while speaking on the “banquet circuit” about their experiences in sports, Tyus recalls. “Women would come up to you and say, ‘I just wish someone had encouraged me in this, that, and the other. And I would like to have my daughters really be recognized and be in a sport,’” she says. Supporting that effort was important to Tyus. “Women shouldn’t have to fight for it like this. Women should be encouraged to be in sports. And that was not happening,” she says. Tyus spent 18 years as a naturalist for the Los Angeles Unified School District, working with kids at a weeklong camp, teaching them about the natural sciences and taking care of the planet. She watched some of them who’d never spent much time outdoors before experience what it was like to be out in nature. You could see them grow in the week they were there, she says. And it took her back to her childhood, when she spent time hiking through the woods with her dad and brothers. “I know that she’s touched some people. They may not turn out to be an Olympic athlete, but they’ll be an Olympic person” who exemplifies the Olympic creed that the journey is more important than winning, Watson says. “She’s my example of that.” “She and Wilma, in my eyes, are the greatest, without a doubt,” Watson says. “I’ve known Tyus for over 50 years, and I’ve trained with her. I know that whatever they did on that track came from them. They had no enhancing things to make them run faster. It all came from blood, sweat, and tears on that track, and determination. … And even though she’s not on the Wheaties box, she’s a genuine champion, her heart and her soul.”",Sport/Sport,Wyomia Tyus: the original athlete activist hiding in plain sight,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/23/wyomia-tyus-athlete-activism-usa-olympics
12/24/2021,"More than 3 million people have been directly affected by the devastation wreaked by Typhoon Rai, which caused widespread power outages and water shortages, and has left some areas completely cut off from relief teams even a week after the disaster. Rai first hit the Philippines last Thursday, and has been described by the Red Cross as one of the worst typhoons to hit the country in December in five decades. The true scale of the destruction is still unknown because of the extensive communication cuts, and damage to roads, ports and airports.  More than 200 municipalities were still without power as of Wednesday evening, according to an update published by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). It warned that children were already becoming ill due to shortages of food and clean water, and said the humanitarian situation may deteriorate further if help is not provided quickly. Alberto Bocanegra, the head of delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in the Philippines, said the agency had been unable to reach communities in parts of Surigao del Norte, Bohol and Cebu. There was little information about the situation on the ground in such areas due to the network outages.“The wind speeds hit the south-western part of the country at more than 185 km/h [115mph] reaching sometimes even 270km/h [168mph] … So it affected roads, it affected general infrastructure like ports and airports. We have problems [such as] no electricity, meaning no access to water, and then of course no communication,” said Bocanegra. In Cebu city, one of the areas experiencing power cuts, water refilling stations have been forced to rely on generators to process potable water, causing delays and shortages. Local media reported that many convenience stores and supermarkets have sold out of water, while street vendors were selling bottles at inflated prices. Long queues have been reported outside gas stations, and many residents have taken to Facebook to share information about where essential supplies are still available. The president, Rodrigo Duterte, has declared a state of calamity in affected areas, allowing local authorities to impose price caps on commodities such as water, and to access emergency resources. Efforts to provide assistance have been further hampered by funding shortages, as many local governments have already exhausted their annual budgets in responding to the Covid pandemic. The Philippines is especially vulnerable to weather-related disasters and typically experiences about 20 typhoons and storms each year. Rai struck the country unusually late in the year since most cyclones develop between July and October. It has forced hundreds of thousands of families from their homes just days ahead of Christmas. “This is a very important time to be together and to be with relatives,” said Bocanegra. “After two years of pandemic and families being separated, it is a big frustration for them.” The Red Cross has provided residents in affected areas with access to satellite phones, so that they can get in touch with relatives and friends. At least 375 people have been killed by Rai. Around 662,000 people are still displaced, while 418,371 people are in evacuation centres, according to the UN. It raised concern over the possible spread of illnesses in such locations. “Children are starting to catch fever, colds, and coughs. Physical distancing and use of protective equipment such as masks are no longer observed in many evacuation centres,” it said. Initial estimates suggest a total of 159,842 houses are damaged, including 61,918 that are completely destroyed. In some areas, the total destruction is even greater than that caused by Super Typhoon Haiyan, the deadliest cyclone on record in the Philippines. It hit the country in November 2013 and left more than 7,360 people dead or missing. Typhoon Rai, which smashed through the southern and central regions of the Philippines, has devastated the livelihoods of farmers, fishing communities and tourism operators. Early estimates suggest that 23,000 hectares of rice have been damaged, and that 12,750 farmers have been affected so far. The cost of such damage is thought to be around US$67m (£50m).",News/World news,Typhoon Rai: more than 3m people directly affected in Philippines,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/typhoon-rai-more-than-3m-people-directly-affected-in-philippines
12/24/2021,"It’s not quite hallelujah time, but the year ends with plentiful reasons for Labour people to be cheerful. Their Christmas cards arrive with scrawled messages of political optimism for 2022, and that’s new. These wilderness years took their toll, with optimism in short supply. Now even Labour’s professional Eeyores are allowing themselves a beam or two of hope: “For the first time, I think we can win,” one tells me, almost surprised to be speaking those words. The poll of polls gives Labour a 6% lead on an upward trajectory. Boris Johnson is plummeting with a 69% disapproval rating against 31% approval and Keir Starmer is now 10 points ahead on who would make the best prime minister with YouGov. Gideon Skinner, Ipsos Mori’s head of political research, points to Starmer now beating Johnson hollow on key measures in their December monitor: best as a capable leader, of sound judgment, understanding the problems facing the country, more honest than most politicians and a good representative for Britain on the world stage. Starmer loses out heavily on “has a lot of personality” and “more style than substance” – but haven’t people had enough of personality and style? On one important measure Johnson still leads by 14 points, as most “patriotic”, so best not to mock the Labour leader appearing in front of a union flag. As for who is “out of touch with ordinary people”, Johnson wins hands down at 63% to Starmer’s 33%.  “This is a new landmark,” Skinner says. “Starmer ahead as the most capable leader is the first time for a Labour leader since Gordon Brown before the 2008 crash. Neither Miliband nor Corbyn ever were.” The government is at its lowest approval rating yet on managing the economy, levelling up and immigration, with seven out of 10 people saying it’s doing a bad job on the NHS and three-quarters responding that it’s doing badly on the cost of living. Pause here to breathe in and relish the moment, because of course there is a “but” coming, so hold the Hosannas. Are we nearly there yet? Halfway, maybe – as no one knows when the election will be, in what economic climate or facing which leader. At last Labour has scotched its dark negatives. “But they haven’t been replaced with positives,” says Skinner. YouGov, which likewise puts Starmer 10 points ahead of Johnson as best prime minister, also finds 55% still don’t think he looks like a prime minister in waiting or that Labour is ready for government. Patrick English, YouGov’s research manager, notes that gains for Starmer and Labour “are clearly built on shaky foundations that could quite quickly crumble if Boris Johnson and his government are able to court favour with the British public once again”. But with Johnson’s low scores on inflation, immigration and health, he “may not find the public so quickly forgiving”. As darts and football crowds chant for his downfall, can anyone recover from such a plunge? His ratings now match the lowest ever for any prime minister, back in 1981, says Skinner. Ah, yes, that was Margaret Thatcher at her lowest ebb, before she went on to win another two elections, followed by one more by her successor. It’s frightening to think this law-breaking, proroguing, treaty-reneging prime minister may even now be pondering how she recovered: she went to war on the other side of the world. The problem, the polls find, is a lack of positive reasons to vote Labour. Too many voters are hanging mid-air, poised to switch, possibly, maybe. YouGov finds a full 20% who voted Tory last time are now undecided: 5% would abstain but only 6% say they would vote Labour instead, so far. Yet after the deep blue rural leavers of North Shropshire’s astounding switch to the Liberal Democrats, something seismic is shifting. They figured out tactical voting, leaping over Labour’s second place to understand that despite the Lib Dems only winning 10% of the vote last time, they had the best chance. An enjoyably mad calculation in the Telegraph shakes with angst: that 34% swing replicated in a general election would produce zero Tory seats, none at all. Its poll mirrors others showing Labour’s current lead would win 320 seats, as the biggest party with no overall majority. One fillip for progressive parties in that byelection was the fading salience of Brexit. YouGov records that 60% of respondents think the government has handled Brexit badly, against 29% saying it was done well. Asked in hindsight was it right or wrong to leave, 49% now say wrong, only 38% right. That gives Starmer’s “Make Brexit work” real traction, especially with Liz Truss at the helm of the sinking Brexit ship. The new year starts with Labour on a bounce, with a newly proactive and pugilistic shadow cabinet. The NHS is an open goal for the combative shadow health secretary Wes Streeting: the Tories have no hiding place from blame for the catastrophic effects of their decade of underfunding and undertraining of medics. It’s time now for Labour to plant more flags giving voters positive reasons to switch. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has made a start: her promise that “the broadest shoulders” will pay for reviving public services has doorstep resonance. More of that is needed on every front to signify policy direction and purpose. Famously, Roy Jenkins mocked Labour preparing for its 1997 win as overcautiously tiptoeing across a slippery floor carrying a Ming vase. Starmer needs to worry a bit less about slipping with that vase, and dare a bit more.

The photo, which also shows Prince Harry with curly haired Archie on his knee, was taken by Alexi Lubomirski this summer at the couple’s home in Santa Barbara, California.  No images of six-month-old Lilibet, named after the Queen’s childhood nickname, have been released before now, and her two-year-old brother’s face has rarely been seen in public. The message on the card reads: “This year, 2021, we welcomed our daughter, Lilibet, to the world. Archie made us a ‘Mama’ and a ‘Papa’, and Lili made us a family. As we look forward to 2022, we have made donations on your behalf to several organizations that honor and protect families – from those being relocated from Afghanistan, to American families in need of paid parental leave: Team Rubicon, Welcome.US, Human First Coalition, Humanity Crew & Paid Leave For All, PL+US, Marshall Plan for Moms. Wishing you a happy holiday season and a prosperous New Year, from our family to yours! As ever, Harry, Meghan, Archie & Lili.” A statement from Harry and Meghan’s Archewell foundation confirmed that the couple had made contributions to the charities, including Welcome.US, which helps Afghan refugees settle in the country, and Team Rubicon, which mobilises military veterans for disaster response.

12/24/2021,"The battle-hardened professional in Bryony Frost will approach the King George VI Chase on Sunday as just another race: in the zone, fence-to-fence, a brief time when nothing on the other side of the running rail can intrude. For everyone else, the sense that a page could be turned in the space of six minutes after the toughest two years of her career is difficult to ignore. The horse, the race and the stage might all have been scripted as a way for Frost to move on from one chapter to the next.  It was in the aftermath of her win on Frodon, a 20-1 outsider, in last year’s King George that rumours emerged of issues between Frost and a weighing-room colleague. “It’s hard for me to chat about it,” she said on the TV cameras trained on her at the time, “because there are still things that need to be sorted out.” Over the months that followed, it emerged that Frost had lodged a formal complaint with the British Horseracing Authority over her treatment by Robbie Dunne. Less than four weeks ago, after a six-day hearing, Dunne was banned from riding for 18 months after a disciplinary panel decided he had subjected Frost to a seven-month campaign of bullying and harassment between February and September 2020. Frost was 22 and still getting a 5lb allowance from senior jockeys due to her inexperience when she climbed aboard Frodon for the first time almost four years ago to the day, on 23 December 2017. Paul Nicholls’s chaser had already had 16 starts in Britain for other riders, including a valuable win in a handicap at Cheltenham in December 2016, but the horse and his new rider bonded so swiftly that it was soon hard to imagine him being ridden by anyone else. In November 2018, Frost rode the 75th winner of her career and joined the ranks of full professionals. It is a rung on the ladder that leaves many young riders racing a struggle to make their mark, but barely a fortnight later, and thanks to Frodon, her ever-dependable ally, Frost made the step up look easy. Under a typically positive ride from the front, and despite giving at least 17lb to all his opponents, Frodon produced one of the best handicap performances of the last 20 years to land a £74,000 first prize, the biggest of Frost’s career to that point. It was a record that survived just three months, before their win in the £196,000 Ryanair Chase in March 2019 made Frost the first female rider to win a Grade One race at the Cheltenham Festival. “He is Pegasus, he’s got wings,” Frost said shortly afterwards. It was a memorable quote, but not one that anyone could have imagined featuring in a disciplinary hearing two-and-a-half years later. But it was this quote, according to Louis Weston, the BHA’s counsel at Dunne’s hearing earlier this month, which the jockey had in mind when he sent a tweet to his 1,500 followers before the Virtual Grand National in April 2020 which appeared to mock Frost’s post-race interviews. “Out of 40 riders … why did you pick on her?”, Weston repeatedly asked Dunne in his cross-examination. Dunne, who had claimed in his witness statement to the hearing that his relationship with Frost was “good or perfect” until September 2020, wriggled and struggled but could not find a worthwhile answer. And so the story returns to Kempton Park on Boxing Day – with one important difference. The grandstands were empty 12 months ago, at a time when Frost told Dunne’s hearing that she was already experiencing “isolation … which I wouldn’t wish on anyone” from other riders which followed her decision to break the weighing-room omerta and lodge a formal complaint with the BHA. Twelve thousand racegoers at Sandown Park on 4 December, midway through the hearing, made their feelings and sympathies very plain as Frost returned to unsaddle after Greaneteen’s victory in the Tingle Creek Chase, the sixth Grade One win of her career. “To feel the support of everyone here is huge,” Frost said. “I was nearly in tears coming in.” Around 20,000 would normally be expected at Kempton for the biggest race of the Christmas programme, and while Covid concerns may well see a lower attendance than usual on Sunday, the prospect of Frodon taking on Minella Indo, last season’s Gold Cup winner, and Clan Des Obeaux, the Kempton winner in 2018 and 2019, will be tough for many to resist. This time around, Frodon is one of the favourites, and Frost’s rivals will be alive to the danger of allowing her a soft lead. But as horse and rider have shown time and again over the last four years, when they are in the zone, it takes a mighty effort to overhaul them. On Sunday, at long last and on her favourite horse, Frost will return to being what she always wanted to be before a weighing-room bully tried to get in her way: an elite jockey in a championship race in front of thousands of fans. And that will make her a winner, no matter what happens on the track.",Sport/Sport,Bryony Frost aims to put bullying case behind her in the King George ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/23/bryony-frost-aims-to-put-bullying-case-behind-her-in-the-king-george-vi-chase-horse-racing
