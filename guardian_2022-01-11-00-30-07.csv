1/11/2022,"Every now and then, a football match comes along that defies explanation. ‚ÄúWas Roma-Juve a comeback or a collapse?‚Äù asked the front-page of Monday‚Äôs Corriere dello Sport, but those options seemed too narrow. This game was a melodrama, a saga, a whole HBO series worth of narratives crammed into 90 minutes, complete with celebrity cameos and premature farewells to your favourite characters. Juventus won 4-3, and that was improbable enough. The Bianconeri had been the lowest-scoring team in the top half of the table, with 28 goals to show for their first 20 matches. Roma had conceded only eight all season at the Stadio Olimpico.  They did so three times in seven second-half minutes on Sunday, throwing away a 3-1 lead after already having surrendered a 1-0 advantage at the start. The last goal was scored by Mattia De Sciglio, a 29-year-old full-back who had found the net just once before in his professional career ‚Äì and that half a decade before. That was not the final plot twist in a game that featured a red card, a penalty, game-changing substitutions, crucial VAR interventions and an injury that could spell longer-term disaster for Juventus but also Italy‚Äôs World Cup qualifying bid. All this with Francesco Totti making a rare appearance in the stands. Perhaps, though, we ought to start at the beginning. Before kick-off we knew that this could be a defining game in both teams‚Äô seasons. Roma, seventh in the table, had a chance to pull level with fifth-placed Juventus. But the Bianconeri needed a win to stay within touching distance of Atalanta ahead of them. Expectations were low for Roma after a disappointing performance against a depleted Milan on Thursday. They had lost 3-1 to opponents missing their first-choice central midfield pairing as well as three-quarters of a starting defence. But Jos√© Mourinho changed up his tactics, swapping away from the three-man defence he used at San Siro to mirror Juventus in a 4-2-3-1. He named Ainsley Maitland-Niles as his right-back, just two days after the player arrived on loan from Arsenal. Bryan Cristante was drafted into midfield and academy graduate Felix Afena-Gyan given a start on the left wing. Incredible drama in Rome! üáÆüáπRoma were cruising to victory but Juventus strike three times in seven minutes to take the lead! ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏èJos√© Mourinho must be LIVID! üëÄ pic.twitter.com/JI2c6sqL1e Individually, those players did not all sparkle. Juventus‚Äôs first goal arrived when Federico Chiesa forced Maitland-Niles on to his heels with a powerful run down the left, before serving Paulo Dybala in the middle. Cristante should have been tracking the Argentinian but was caught ball-watching. Dybala had all the time he needed to pick out the bottom corner. Roma‚Äôs change in shape, however, was effective. Juventus‚Äôs manager, Massimiliano Allegri, was serving a suspension but his sideline surrogate, Marco Landucci, confessed that the switch caught them off guard. Cristante and Jordan Veretout held the middle of the pitch, starving their Juventus counterparts Manuel Locatelli and Rodrigo Bentancur of early possession. Roma won five corners in the game‚Äôs opening 11 minutes and took the lead from the last of those with a Tammy Abraham header. They could have had a penalty, and a chance to go 2-0 up, when Lorenzo Pellegrini‚Äôs shot rebounded from Matthijs De Ligt‚Äôs boot on to his outstretched arm. Instead, Juventus equalised through Dybala. But Roma stayed on top. They retook the lead on a deflected shot from Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Then Pellegrini, Roma‚Äôs captain, scored a magnificent free-kick to make it 3-1. The TV cameras tracked to his predecessor Totti. Here was your story: a passing-of-the-baton moment, the rise of a new Roma team made possible by the emergence of another homegrown captain. A Juventus comeback seemed implausible. Chiesa had exited the game before half-time with what immediately looked like a serious knee injury and has now been confirmed as a cruciate ligament tear ‚Äì a hammer blow for club and country. Landucci sent on √Ålvaro Morata for Moise Kean in the 63rd minute. The Spaniard scarcely saw the ball for the next seven, but then, out of nowhere, conjured a game-changing assist, driving toward the touchline on the right, dragging the ball away from Roger Iba√±ez‚Äôs sliding challenge and floating a cross for Locatelli to head home. Verona 1-2 Salernitana, Inter 2-1 Lazio, Roma 3-4 Juventus, Genoa 0-1 Spezia, Udinese 2-6 Atalanta, Napoli 1-0 Sampdoria, Empoli 1-5 Sassuolo, Venezia 0-3 Milan Just like that, the game was transformed. Dejan Kulusevski fired Juventus level, driving his shot into the ground and up into the roof of the net after Morata‚Äôs initial attempt was blocked. The goal was initially disallowed but VAR confirmed that there was no offside. Then Morata combined with Weston McKennie down the left, before the American chipped the ball over for De Sciglio to run inside. Chris Smalling got his head on the ball but could not intercept it. The full-back finished at the near post. Delirium. And a new story: Juventus rescued by Morata, the forward whose future had been in doubt amid reports of interest from Atletico Madrid. Only, this game still was not done. Roma won a penalty in the 81st minute, De Ligt handling the ball inside the area a second time. The Dutchman, already booked, was shown a red card. The cameras went back to Totti as Pellegrini stepped up, but this time we would not see either man celebrate. A weak spot-kick was saved by Wojciech Szczƒôsny ‚Äì the Juventus goalkeeper who turned his career around during three seasons right here at Roma. When the full-time whistle finally went, half of the people inside the Olimpico looked to be in a daze. Juventus celebrated, but even Landucci joked that he hoped Allegri ‚Äúcomes back soon because I just lost five or six years of my life.‚Äù To throw away such an important game from such a commanding position could only be a hammer blow to Roma. Defeat left them nine points adrift of the Champions League places, and there are more damning statistics to be found. This is the first time since 1988-89 that the Giallorossi have been beaten at home by Juventus, Milan and Inter in the same season. A crestfallen Mourinho sought to portray the defeat afterwards as further evidence of the limitations of the squad he had inherited. ‚ÄúMy heart hurts because I am not used to this profile of team,‚Äù he was quoted as saying in La Repubblica. ‚ÄúI am here to give the lads a way to improve. But I want the team to follow me in going above their limits, not that they should take me to their level.‚Äù Right now the question might be whether they have moved forward at all. Roma are eight points worse off than they were at the corresponding point last season, despite considerable summer investment. The Portugal midfielder S√©rgio Oliveira is set to join on loan and it is possible that the club may do more business before the end of this month. There is no new signing, though, who can restore the opportunity they threw away to beat Juventus this weekend.",Sport/Football,Roma 3-4 Juve: a magical melodrama with more twists than a HBO series | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/10/roma-3-4-juve-a-magical-melodrama-with-more-twists-than-a-hbo-series
1/11/2022,"Boris Johnson will not face a new investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, over the refurbishment of the Downing Street flat, No 10 has confirmed. The prime minister had been accused of failing to be transparent about the financing of the project, the cost of which was initially met by the Tory donor David Brownlow.  Asked about reports that Stone would not pursue the matter further, however, Johnson‚Äôs official spokesperson said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for me to speak for or on behalf of her, but she has confirmed that they won‚Äôt be looking at the flat.‚Äù It is understood that a letter from Stone was received by Johnson last week saying that she was not minded to pursue a fresh inquiry. The letter has not yet been published. The prime minister was criticised last week by his independent ethics adviser, Christopher Geidt, over his failure to hand over WhatsApp exchanges with Lord Brownlow, when a previous investigation into the refurbishment by Lord Geidt was carried out. Johnson issued a ‚Äúhumble and sincere apology‚Äù for failing initially to give Geidt the key messages. Geidt is pressing for more powers in order to cement his independence from Downing Street. Stone, who oversees the code of conduct for MPs, had made clear she would decide whether to take a fresh look at the issue once the Electoral Commission had reported on it. The commission fined the Conservative party ¬£17,800 for failing to disclose payments from Brownlow‚Äôs company of ¬£67,801.72, which it said should have been registered as political donations. Johnson later repaid the money himself. In the WhatsApp messages, published by Geidt last week, Johnson complained that the flat, for which he receives ¬£30,000 a year to maintain it, was ‚Äúa bit of a tip‚Äù. Johnson told Geidt that the missing WhatsApp messages had only belatedly come to light because he had changed his phone. Their existence was revealed by the Electoral Commission report into the funding of the refurbishment. The WhatsApp exchange sparked fresh questions about ‚Äúcash for access‚Äù, with Johnson and Brownlow discussing ‚ÄúGreat Exhibition 2.0,‚Äù a plan favoured by the peer, alongside the funding of the designer revamp of the flat. Brownlow was later given the opportunity to discuss the idea with the then culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, at the Royal Albert Hall. Johnson‚Äôs botched attempt to overhaul the system for policing MPs‚Äô conduct over the case of the disgraced Tory former MP Owen Paterson was seen by some at Westminster as an attempt to prevent Stone prying further into the prime minister‚Äôs own affairs. She can recommend a suspension from parliament, as she did in Paterson‚Äôs case.",News/Politics,Parliament watchdog will not open new investigation over Johnson‚Äôs flat refurb,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/10/parliament-watchdog-investigation-flat-refurb-boris-johnson
1/11/2022,"Liz Vick doesn‚Äôt rest easily in her apartment. She is one of 270 households in the Lamba Court complex in Salford and has recently contributed ¬£3,000 to the cost of a temporary fire alarm system to avoid the need for night watch patrols to give early warnings of fires. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt sleep well,‚Äù the 32-year-old account manager said. ‚ÄúFire alarms go off through the night. I can‚Äôt tell you the feeling when a fire alarm goes off and you know you are in a flammable flat and you have 15 minutes to get out before the building burns down.‚Äù  Engineers found serious faults with the cavity barriers inside the walls that are supposed to stop the spread of fire. Many were missing. She said others were stuffed with plastic bubble wrap, a solution apparently improvised by builders. A survey found ‚Äúa poor quality of workmanship resulting in discontinuous, inadequately secured and missing cavity barriers in the areas required by the building regulations at the time of build‚Äù. The block also has wooden balconies, and the flats are essentially worthless because mortgage companies are unlikely to lend to prospective buyers. Fixing the problems could cost anywhere between ¬£60,000 and ¬£115,000 for each apartment. ‚ÄúThe figures have been hideous,‚Äù she said. The proposals made on Monday by Michael Gove to guarantee that people in medium-rise apartment blocks between 11 metres and 18 metres in height do not have to pay to fix their dangerous homes will not help Vick and her neighbours, because the announcement applies only to cladding. Gove later hinted on BBC Breakfast and Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme that leaseholders would not be held responsible for paying for other work that was not their responsibility in the first place. ‚ÄúI have had meetings with advisers about bankruptcy, which I never thought in my life I would have to do,‚Äù Vick said. ‚ÄúI am very much expecting to end the year as a bankrupt.‚Äù She faces the prospect of moving back in with family or friends. ‚Äú[The announcement] is just cladding, yet again,‚Äù she said, after Gove‚Äôs plans first emerged. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say I am surprised. This isn‚Äôt the first time the government has made this fuss. The announcement comes, and you find out it‚Äôs just cladding and you are heartbroken. This doesn‚Äôt help in any way unless they open it up to other fire defects. It is completely useless to us if it‚Äôs just cladding. Lots of other [affected] people don‚Äôt have cladding either and cavity barriers are one of the biggest issues.‚Äù She bought the flat in 2018 after making careful checks about the fire safety of the cladding, but there was no way she could know about the internal problems. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get on with my life,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt start a family with my fiance. I am now on medication for anxiety and depression and I am due to start therapy. You are constantly in survival mode.‚Äù She has postponed marriage plans ‚Äúbecause there is no possibility we can afford a wedding‚Äù. She said the leaseholders had contacted the developer of the block, Bellway, several times. A leaseholder from Lamba actually went to the developer‚Äôs annual general meeting before Christmas to confront them and deliver a letter signed by leaseholders asking for help with ‚Äúruinous costs‚Äù. She said they were awaiting a response from Bellway‚Äôs chief executive, Jason Honeyman. The freeholder had refused to pay for any remediation and had stopped communication with leaseholders, she said.

1/11/2022,"There is so far only one lesson in the ‚Äúacquittal‚Äù of the tennis player Novak Djokovic on a charge of seeking to enter Australia unvaccinated. It is that something is badly wrong with that country‚Äôs border controls. The judge found that the tennis star had met all reasonable requirements for admission, as was conceded by the Canberra government. He had two separate permits for exemption from vaccination, one from the Australian tennis authorities and one from the state of Victoria. His visa was cancelled at the gate after he had landed, without time to reach his lawyer. He was detained in a notorious hostel used to house asylum seekers. The procedure was bizarre.  Whether Australia‚Äôs cabinet decides to overrule the judge and restore the visa ban has yet to be seen. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, might argue that reinstating the ban will set an example to all vaccination dodgers to beware, even if they have jumped through the correct bureaucratic hoops and met the rules. Alternatively Djokovic may choose to wash Australia out of his system rather than face an unpleasant reception from tennis fans at next week‚Äôs Australian Open. They have suffered extreme lockdowns for want of the vaccinations that Djokovic opposes. However, this particular fiasco has little to do with the fact that Djokovic has refused the Covid vaccine. Equally it should be irrelevant that Morrison ‚Äì and others ‚Äì have so clearly wanted Djokovic‚Äôs high-profile scalp for the pro-vaccination cause. By handling Djokovic‚Äôs case so badly, the Australian authorities have turned this into a test for the cause of natural justice and the championing of human rights. The judge asked not whether vaccination is a good idea, but what the tennis player should have done that he failed to do. There was no answer, leaving the judge ‚Äúagitated‚Äù by the tennis player‚Äôs ‚Äúmanifestly unjust‚Äù treatment, as if he were a plague carrier requiring instant incarceration. At a time when authoritarian governments everywhere are riding roughshod over the rule of law, the Djokovic decision is an admittedly modest victory for its champions. Around the world, including in Australia, rules governing immigration are under extreme strain. British border officials are gearing up to turn back dinghies in the Channel. Syrians are sent back and forth across the eastern Mediterranean. Refugees are dying off the coast of Libya. Latin Americans are making their way through Mexico and hitting Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúwall‚Äù. Dictatorships and democracies alike face internal and external pressures that are bringing anarchy to their borders. Ever more nations on every continent are seeing these borders weaken and break. How they respond will have a dramatic effect on international relations as well as human rights. For every Djokovic at the gate there will be hundreds of thousands whose cases go unheard. Therein lies his relevance.

1/11/2022,"Stories of the disintegrating relationship between the police and young black people are endless, but an artist behind an unlikely new project hopes he can help break down barriers. Kay Rufai was enlisted by West Midlands police last year to be their artist in residence ‚Äì thought to be a first for a police force. He has spent several months taking photographs and film of officers and young, mostly black people who have had dealings with the police. The images were then presented to police in order to spark a conversation and ‚Äúchallenge their preconceptions‚Äù.  ‚ÄúI wanted to use visual media because it‚Äôs a powerful tool to really engage with themes of stereotyping and biases,‚Äù said Rufai. ‚ÄúIn the last few years there has definitely been a spike in violence that‚Äôs affecting young people, especially young black boys. A lot of the political and societal narrative around this is that these young people are gang members and we need to overpolice these communities and increase jail times. But there was nothing in the conversation about preventive measures ‚Ä¶ At the same time, I wanted to present a human side of the police, not just PC 65609. That‚Äôs not who you are ‚Äì that‚Äôs a script.‚Äù The project, called Barriers to Bridges, is being funded by the Coventry City of Culture Trust and the West Midlands police and crime commissioner‚Äôs office, and will be publicly displayed in February. Rufai, who has previous experience of working with young people, including for his SMILE-ing Boys project, said that nothing like this had been done in the UK before. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen young people from marginalised communities and a big structural bureaucratic system like a police force brought together like this. It could really help make a lot of the changes that we‚Äôre hoping to see.‚Äù Local youth services, including Coventry Youth Offending Service, Positive Youth Foundation and Creative Optimistic Visions, helped to facilitate his time with young people. Some of the most evocative images taken for the police included those of David, who is captured getting drumsticks out of his jogging bottoms. ‚ÄúWe see him dipping his hand in his pocket, pulling something out, and then at the point where he pulls out the drumsticks, the audience is like, ‚ÄòOh, wow, I actually thought something different ‚Ä¶ I thought maybe he was trying to pull out a weapon‚Äô.‚Äù There was also Aisha, who experienced an armed raid at her house last year. ‚ÄúThe police kicked the door in looking for weapons,‚Äù said Rufai. ‚ÄúHer photographs and story had a significant effect. I think the fact that she was a girl was surprising.‚Äù Rufai is a police abolitionist, making him part of a movement that advocates replacing policing with other public safety systems. He has also been profiled and mistakenly stopped by the police many times in his life. But he said he was heartened by the discussions and debates he had with officers, some of whom were surprisingly vulnerable. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a particular officer who I took a walk with in an area where a young person, around 13 years old, was killed in a violent way a couple of years ago. RIP was written on one of the shutters of the shops. The officer spoke about how he was a really good kid who loved playing football. The officer provided police support within the kid‚Äôs school, but then because of a shift in his role he wasn‚Äôt able to go into the neighbourhood as much. He sometimes wonders whether he could have averted the kid‚Äôs death. He was so visibly emotional, he was actually in tears. He has sleepless nights over this boy‚Äôs death.‚Äù The chief constable of West Midlands police, Sir David Thompson, was a huge champion of the residency, said Rufai. ‚ÄúHe recognises the necessity for reform. But obviously he occupies a very senior position. The officers who were the biggest challenge to engage with were some of those who were down on the ground.‚Äù So the artist went on ride-alongs and asked officers questions to challenge their ‚Äúbinary idea of good guys and bad guy‚Äù and help them ‚Äúunderstand the racial and social contexts before approaching a young person‚Äù. West Midlands police said the residency offered them a chance to do things differently. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a really innovative way to explore the lived experiences of young people in Coventry, to not only give them a voice but also a platform for it to be heard. We also hoped it would give people insight into policing and humanise the uniform, to foster a better understanding of each other through honest dialogue and strive towards building empathy. It‚Äôs so important that we‚Äôre able to keep young people safe and reduce youth violence, so why not try a different approach?‚Äù ",News/UK news,‚ÄòI wanted to present a human side‚Äô: West Midlands police‚Äôs artist in residence on building bridges,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/10/i-wanted-to-present-a-human-side-west-midlands-polices-artist-in-residence-on-building-bridges
1/11/2022,"On 17 March 2020, the chancellor Rishi Sunak, made a speech about the government‚Äôs intention to help support UK citizens facing the oncoming economic threat of the coronavirus pandemic. ‚ÄúWe will support jobs, we will support incomes, we will support businesses and we will help you protect your loved ones,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe will do whatever it takes.‚Äù And yet, if the data on the number of people falling into destitution since then are anything to go by, then these commitments have fallen far short. As per the definition provided by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), destitution means ‚Äúgoing without the essentials we all need to eat, stay warm and dry, and keep clean‚Äù. For a country as wealthy as the UK, you might expect this number would be very low. But according to the JRF‚Äôs Destitution in the UK 2020 report, more than a million households were destitute in the UK at some point in 2019, a figure representing 2.4 million people. Among them were 550,000 children. On this basis, the JRF calculates that the number of households experiencing destitution in the UK had increased by 35% since 2017, and the number of people experiencing destitution had increased by 54%.  On the face of it, these figures are shocking, but the data was gathered before the Covid-19 outbreak. What is even more concerning is what the report portends for the pandemic‚Äôs impact on those perilously close to destitution. Working alongside the Trussell Trust, a charity committed to ending poverty and hunger, which runs food banks and is therefore in many ways on the frontline of the issue, academics from Heriot-Watt University estimate that destitution levels in the UK will approximately double as a result of the pandemic and the associated economic lockdowns, even taking into account the mitigating effects of relevant policy measures (such as the enhancement of various welfare protections). Almost two years into the pandemic and the Trussell Trust‚Äôs chief executive, Emma Revie, says the report was right to sound the alarm. ‚ÄúDuring the Covid-19 lockdown in spring 2020, food banks in the Trussell Trust network experienced an unprecedented growth in the need for food parcels,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúPeople referred to food banks in the Trussell Trust network are a very deprived group: almost everyone meets the definition of being destitute. In early 2020, three-quarters were severely food insecure, and one in five were homeless. The majority experienced two or more types of deprivation.‚Äù Interestingly though, the Trussell Trust‚Äôs 2021 State of Hunger report [pdf] observed that the demographic of those visiting food banks had shifted during the pandemic: ‚ÄúDuring Covid-19, the profile of people referred to food banks changed slightly: in a survey conducted during the summer of 2020 there were relatively more private renters, people born outside of the UK/Europe, people aged between 25 and 44, and couples with children than before the pandemic.‚Äù It goes on to say that the proportion who were furloughed was relatively small at 4% of all people referred to food banks, suggesting that the furlough scheme for those who were able to receive it managed to hold many families out of destitution. The reasons behind soaring destitution in the UK are manifold. ‚ÄúWithin our research, we looked at the number of people who met that criterion of meeting destitution,‚Äù says Revie, who attributes at least some of this growth to failures within the social security system. ‚ÄúWe know it‚Äôs about access to income. The average household income for somebody coming to a food bank after they‚Äôve covered their accommodation costs is just ¬£57 a week ‚Äì significantly below the average household income of somebody sitting on the poverty line.‚Äù Taking this all into account, says Revie, 95% of people coming to food banks in the Trussell Trust‚Äôs network are experiencing destitution. Those likelier to be more vulnerable to destitution, according to the JRF, include young adults, single mothers and those living in the north-east of England. But there are other factors too, such as the five-week wait between applying for universal credit (UC) and receiving it. The Trussell Trust is actively campaigning to end this as it forces people into debt: as people still have to pay bills during this period, the government offers an advance on that first payment, which has to be repaid from subsequent UC payments, therefore leaving people owing money back to the government, locking them into hardship from the outset. Shockingly, almost half (47%) of people surveyed at food banks owed money to the DWP. Job insecurity is obviously a key factor in pushing people into applying for UC in the first place and has been exacerbated dramatically by the pandemic-enforced lockdowns. According to the Office for National Statistics, the rate of redundancies recorded since the beginning of the pandemic exceeds the highest rate reached during the 2008 to 2009 financial crisis. And though the economy may have started to rebound since the midst of the pandemic, for anyone who has fallen into destitution the long-lasting impacts aren‚Äôt easy to bounce back from simply by getting a job. So what can you do if you find yourself falling into destitution? Revie says to come to a food bank in the Trussell Trust network if you can, where you can access essential items and speak to staff who are trained in helping people to navigate the benefits system. ‚ÄúFirst of all, you‚Äôd be very warmly welcomed,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd sit and have a cup of tea and ensure that you had enough food for yourself and your family and anyone living in your household.‚Äù Beyond that, says Revie, they would also be looking to try to get you specialist support and advice to see if you are getting everything in terms of the benefits you‚Äôre entitled to. ‚ÄúWe signpost on to a wide, wide array of partner organisations to help with housing or benefits challenges, or for people struggling with their mental health,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnything we can do, to walk a little bit on that journey with you, and see if we can provide any support so that if you‚Äôve had to come to a food bank once ‚Äì which for us, is just indicative of the system having failed ‚Äì that you won‚Äôt have to come back in the future.‚Äù",The last 10 years of food banks,The five-week wait: how a delay in universal credit can drive people into destitution,https://www.theguardian.com/the-last-10-years-of-food-banks/2022/jan/10/the-five-week-wait-how-a-delay-in-universal-credit-can-drive-people-into-destitution
1/11/2022,"Jenny, 41, HampshireIn 2019, I had mental health issues and couldn‚Äôt work. My flat was repossessed and I ended up in emergency temporary accommodation and claiming universal credit for the first time. I was living on ¬£291 a month. I never thought I would walk through the doors of a food bank, because there is a stigma involved. It took a lot for me to do it ‚Äì I had no choice because I had no food. But I was greeted by a lovely woman. She could see I was nervous, so she sat me down with a cup of coffee and a slice of cake while we talked about what I needed. That experience changed everything for me because I realised it was OK to ask for help. I‚Äôd love the government to reverse the decision on the universal credit cut. They increased it when people who had previously been working on higher salaries realised that universal credit wasn‚Äôt enough money. To take it away in the beginning of winter is, I think, a disgusting decision to make.  Martin, 55, NewcastleI can‚Äôt work because of my mental health issues and disabilities ‚Äì I am visually impaired and because I have type 2 diabetes, I need to eat regularly. I‚Äôm on what they call legacy benefits. In the pandemic, people on universal credit received ¬£80 a month extra, but we didn‚Äôt get anything at all. Food is going up in price, but your benefits do not go up to match it. I only receive ¬£370 a fortnight. So that‚Äôs why you need the food banks ‚Äì because you cannot buy a healthy diet. I really am grateful, but you shouldn‚Äôt have to rely on food banks in the 21st century. At the end of the day, the Trussell Trust is a charity and they‚Äôre doing the government‚Äôs job. Amie, 41, LincolnshireMy husband left us in 2017, and at the same time I lost my job as a teacher. The jobcentre gave me food bank vouchers to tide us over and I used them for three or four months. The food bank staff were super supportive, making me cups of tea and gathering all the things we could possibly need. I felt instantly valued. The kids were so happy, they were like: ‚ÄúOh what have we got this week?‚Äù I found employment through the jobcentre so I felt a lot more steady after that. I tried to get involved in what different places are doing in terms of eradicating the need for food banks, so I set up a food co-op to share food between people. We‚Äôre saving food from landfill and we‚Äôre also feeding our families. Yuyan, 34, WandsworthI had experienced domestic violence in Spain. I was fired just before the first lockdown and was left with a child to take care of and a flat to pay for, so in September 2020 I came to London. Due to Covid they were not issuing national insurance numbers. Because I had run out of money to rent a room and it was difficult to find a job, I was on the verge of being homeless. The food bank made such a difference ‚Äì it was the only support I had all year. I received food parcels for four months. Thanks to the food bank I also had all the information about doing my paperwork, where to make appointments. I‚Äôve always felt like they were a phone call away for any situation. If there were more centres to give that valuable information to people, and have people as dedicated as they are in Wandsworth food bank, a lot of people would get out of this situation like I did. Sally, 53, Welwyn Garden CityI haven‚Äôt worked in a paid job for about nine years. I suffer from depression and anxiety, which is why I‚Äôm on ESA (employment and support allowance). I‚Äôm also a carer for my adult disabled daughter. I had to go to the food bank because I just did not have enough to live on. I used it about three times. I tried to hold out from going because of embarrassment. But the food banks in this area are run by very nice, caring people ‚Äì you‚Äôre made to feel very welcome. The Department for Work and Pensions called me up out of the blue and told me I hadn‚Äôt been paid enough all that time and I did get a substantial amount as a back payment. It‚Äôs not uncommon ‚Äì I‚Äôve heard of it happening a lot. It would be ideal if they calculated things correctly in the first place. Jade, 34, WandsworthI‚Äôve been unemployed for the past couple of years ‚Äì before that I‚Äôd been employed all my life. After my dad‚Äôs death I fell off the rails a bit due to depression and anxiety. I‚Äôm on universal credit and I‚Äôve been using the food bank for the past three months. If I didn‚Äôt have it I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôd do for food right now. Because of my mental health condition, asking for help is difficult, so the food bank provides me with a safe space to be able to talk and to find help, especially with Citizens Advice, which helped me get my studio flat. I spend two hours there every week. It doesn‚Äôt take two hours to pick up my food parcel, but there are so many kind, caring people that dedicate their time to speak to people who don‚Äôt often have conversation or can feel lost and lonely. Steve, 43, FulhamI had a back injury at work, and had to move to a desk job. I coped with the pain with alcohol and ended up with alcohol dependency and had to go into rehab. When I came out I was on the basic level of ESA, just above the benefit cap, and my accommodation was a studio flat, so my housing benefit wasn‚Äôt even covering the rent. The food bank was a lifeline. There‚Äôs no way that I would have survived without it. And just having that support to get me back on my feet was really important. The benefits system needs to be reformed so that it supports the people who really need it. When we‚Äôre told that everybody is a scrounger, it‚Äôs really disheartening. Having reforms so that people get the benefits they need will change things so much. Some names have been changed.",The last 10 years of food banks,Seven people on how food banks have supported them: ‚ÄòI wouldn‚Äôt have survived without it‚Äô,https://www.theguardian.com/the-last-10-years-of-food-banks/2022/jan/10/seven-people-on-how-food-banks-have-supported-them-i-wouldnt-have-survived-without-it
1/11/2022,"For people who were already in poverty before the pandemic, the past 18 months have hit particularly hard. Many have had to deal with a drastic reduction in income as a result of loss of employment, and those on benefits now face the combined blow of a ¬£20 cut to universal credit, inflation at its highest rate for 10 years and a major hike in fuel prices. It is, says Matt Copeland, head of policy affairs at National Energy Action, a ‚Äútoxic cocktail‚Äù. Indeed, a study by the Legatum Institute found that 700,000 people had already been plunged into poverty in 2020. Many people who relied on casual work were suddenly unemployed and ineligible for furlough schemes during this period, exacerbating the problem.  Between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, the Trussell Trust‚Äôs network of food banks distributed 2.5m emergency food parcels ‚Äì an increase of a third on the previous year and a 128% increase on the same period five years ago, as tens of thousands found themselves using a food bank for the first time. ‚ÄúIf somebody is unable to afford food, the likelihood is that they are already struggling to afford heating and their core utilities, as well as other things, including their accommodation costs and personal hygiene items,‚Äù says Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust. Even before the rise in fuel prices, she adds, 95% of people in need of assistance from food banks were already experiencing destitution. But as the cost of natural gas soars, there are fears that far more households will be thrown into fuel poverty. This term can be defined a number of ways, but one definition is a household that spends more than 10% of net income on energy bills. By this measure, 2.5m households were already in fuel poverty in 2021, and a study by York University predicts the figure will rise to nearly 3.5m this year. Those households will be faced with what Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, describes as the ‚Äúterrible choice‚Äù between turning on the heating or paying for food. ‚ÄúCertain groups are more likely to fall through the safety net than others,‚Äù says Revie. Disabled people, she says, are significantly overrepresented at food banks. But families with multiple children are badly affected too, due to the combined costs of cooking regularly for more people and keeping the house warm. Those on the frontline are already observing this play out. Between mid-October and mid-November, the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) says it saw a 10% increase over the previous month in people seeking referrals for food banks and for extra charitable support, including for toiletries and other essentials. Kayley Hignell, head of policy for Families, Welfare and Work at CAB, says that since the cut to universal credit, advisers have seen an increase in people needing crisis support. ‚ÄúThat means food bank referrals so families can put a meal on the table and fuel vouchers so they can have the heating on,‚Äù she says. Others are in extremely desperate situations due to the overlapping effects of illness and poverty. Hignell cites as an example a cancer patient referred to CAB who is only able to afford to heat one room in their house because money is so tight following the universal credit cut. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre struggling to afford healthy food and are worried about rising bills this winter,‚Äù she says. But the rise in natural gas prices doesn‚Äôt just mean higher bills. Twenty-eight energy suppliers went out of business in 2021, with potentially devastating repercussions for those behind on their bills. When user debt from those suppliers is transferred to an administrator, different rules can apply, says Copeland: ‚ÄúWhile an energy supplier has to have detailed conversations with you to make sure you‚Äôre able to pay, and that you‚Äôre on a reasonable debt repayment plan, you could just be visited by the administrator and asked for the money, and debt collection agencies can get involved very quickly.‚Äù Further, says Copeland, if a household uses a prepayment meter, and their supplier goes out of business, the infrastructure allowing them to top up their meter may stop working ‚Äì leaving them with no energy. Households on low incomes are entitled to apply for the government‚Äôs Warm Home Discount Scheme, a one-off ¬£140 discount to electricity bills for households on low incomes. If the discount has been agreed with the supplier, but not yet paid, however, and the supplier goes bust, there is no guarantee it will be transferred to the new supplier, says Copeland. Only limited help is available. The ¬£500m Household Support Fund and the Cold Weather Payment of ¬£25 for each seven-day period of very cold weather were introduced to help poorer households. They will make a difference, says Copeland, but not enough. Food banks in the Trussell Trust network also help by signposting users to specialist welfare advisers who make sure they are receiving their full entitlement. But, says Revie, even the full entitlements available can often not be enough in practice. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing people at food banks who have their maximum entitlement or who have secured everything they can and are still not able to afford those essentials,‚Äù she says. Revie is deeply concerned about what the next year may have in store for those on the brink of destitution. ‚ÄúEmergency food parcels are a sticking plaster,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe know [demand] is driven by people not having enough money. A substantial rise in energy prices for households who are already struggling will have a catastrophic impact ‚Äì I think we can‚Äôt really overstate it.‚Äù",The last 10 years of food banks,The eight-year high: how fuel spikes have created a winter heating crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/the-last-10-years-of-food-banks/2022/jan/10/the-eight-year-high-how-fuel-spikes-have-created-a-winter-heating-crisis
1/11/2022,"In a bare and violent patch of land in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 75,000 people are living in what one UN field officer described as ‚Äúhellish conditions‚Äù. Food and water are scarce. Even the flimsiest shelters are in short supply and sanitation is nonexistent. Girls have been raped by militiamen while attempting to find food in fields around the site. Ibrahim Cisse of Unicef says people here are effectively being held hostage. Rhoe ‚Äì a remote camp of internally displaced people (IDP) approximately 45km northeast of Bunia, the capital of DRC‚Äôs Ituri province ‚Äì is ‚Äúa tragedy waiting to happen‚Äù, according to those who have visited.  Ituri province is home to what is possibly Africa‚Äôs largest unexplored gold reserve, and in diplomatic circles has been called ‚Äúthe bloodiest corner of DRC‚Äù. But even by Ituri standards Rhoe camp is grim, and the significance of the UN‚Äôs appeal for urgent support here should not be underestimated. For many in Rhoe it will be not the first or even second time they have become refugees in their own land. The three DRC warlords convicted at the international criminal court (ICC) for their part in the ongoing violence ‚Äì Thomas Lubanga, Germain Katanga and Bosco Ntaganda, the subjects, respectively, of the ICC‚Äôs first ever conviction, in March 2012, first case in which crimes of sexual violence including rape and sexual slavery were charged (although he was acquitted) and the longest sentence ever issued ‚Äì began their killing careers here. In 2003, the EU deployed its first autonomous military intervention in Ituri. It was an attempt to shield a population not being protected by government or international peacekeepers. Now Ituri is burning again. A militia group known as the Cooperative for the Development of Congo, or Codeco, which distinguishes itself by its copious use of machetes and flamethrowers against civilians, is terrorising the population. According to UN briefings seen by the Guardian, the situation started to deteriorate on 12 November when Codeco began ramping up attacks on villages and within camps, placing pressure on already struggling relief operations. In one attack, in Tsuya, 1,296 houses were destroyed by Codeco militia. No one knows how many died. At around the same time, Codeco men armed with ageing AK-47s attacked the villages of Buki, Ngazba, Kpaluba, Tata and Litsinga; opening fire at random and torching houses. In Reta, in the furrows of Djugu territory, not far from the Drodro camp, a two-month-old baby girl was killed during a Codeco attack. Unicef says militiamen also destroyed three hospitals and two schools in the area, and have made any kind of humanitarian assistance impossible. Those who survived the assaults fled to camps at Tch√© and Drodro. On 21 November, Tch√© was attacked; 950 shelters were destroyed. Codeco also attacked Drodro, killing at least 35 and destroying 14 of the 18 housing blocks that sheltered IDPs. Over the last eight weeks militiamen have attacked at least four IDP camps in Ituri. These accounts shed light not only on the violence unfolding in Ituri but also reveal that at least 35,000 children, almost half of Rhoe‚Äôs population, are at risk of death through starvation or disease. What will happen to people without any food, including the 19 breastfeeding women who gave birth in the camp in December? Built to shelter 6,000 households, Rhoe was already a humanitarian tinderbox, hopelessly over capacity. Aid agencies can reach the camp only by helicopter. In December, Unicef counted over 14,000 households in the camp, making up a total of 75,000 people; there is one toilet for every 1,300 people and sewage flows openly. Three cases of measles have been identified. People are dying of respiratory illnesses, diarrhoea and malaria. There is no equipment to hold funerals. There is also only one clinic, run by Doctors Without Borders, with an adjacent twometre sq delivery room for women in labour. These conditions are alongside impunity-fuelled violence, starvation and displacement that has festered since 1996, leaving the government unable to keep its citizens safe, secure or fed. More than 27 million are facing starvation. Approximately 5.5 million people, including 3.2 million children and 1.2 million women, have now been displaced from their homes because of violence. In May 2021 DRC‚Äôs president, Felix Tshisekedi, declared a state of emergency in Ituri and neighbouring North Kivu. Yet Tshisekedi has appointed Floribert Ndjabu as his evoy for the region, a man who served 15 years in preventive detention on suspicion of the murders of nine UN peacekeepers in 2005. Last August, he employed another former rebel leader, Tommy Tambwe, three months before Tambwe‚Äôs militia gang M23 allegedly attacked Bukavu. Tshisekedi has promoted many figures the UN has labeled ‚Äúred generals,‚Äù some of whom are under UN and EU sanctions for human rights violations, including Gen Gabriel Amisi, Gen Muhindo Akili Mundos, Fall Sikabwe Asinda, Thierry Ilunga Kibambi and Egide Ngoy. How can you protect civilians from violence if the very men who caused it are in power? Unicef says it needs $356m (¬£260m) to hold back hunger and disease in Ituri, including Ebola, measles, meningitis and cholera. But there has been no indication from London, Washington or Brussels that any programme will be funded. Everyone of course understands that money will only address the symptoms and not the fundamental problem. It is largely a question of political will: whether or not to send-in UN lawyers ‚Äì not troops ‚Äì to end the impunity still fuelling the ongoing violence, starvation and displacement.",News/Global development,"As violence in the Congo escalates, thousands of displaced people are effectively held hostage | Vava Tampa",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/10/as-violence-drc-democratic-republic-congo-escalates-thousands-are-effectively-being-held-hostage
