2/18/2022,"I walk up the lane in the dark. Inside the car, all the glows betrayed the sky, but now I’m out, I can see its light goes deep. Deeper with every step. Soon I’m the only sound. I slow my walk and lighten my steps. I’m hoping for owls, which I’ve seen hunting here. What I hear is rodents, agitating the hedges to the left, and at my feet when I climb a stile, its surface shimmering with frost. Now in the field, I look right until the house appears.  It’s a husk: chimneys from a square, like bottles in a carrier. Anyone who comes up here could find many things to ponder about what this place could represent with the slightest of metaphysical squints. I’ve done it myself. The ruin of what in the 17th century was a commanding house, on a hill – rare in itself here – now crumbling, and surrounded by a trifecta of time and place: the stone town of Stamford one way, the A1 another, the grand estate of Burghley the last. And in the middle of this intersection, Wothorpe Towers. Mainly I come here because it’s atmospheric. By day, the road-roar corrupts any serenity, but late at night, it lessens. And nothing’s lit. No unnecessary “accent lighting”, as planners call it. A few cottages with lampglow in the windows down the hill, and that’s it: a column of pristine darkness, or close enough. As a human, the towers conjure unease. Empty windows like skull sockets, evoking the rural spooks of MR James or Susan Hill. But the nature around it, particularly at night, unexpectedly calms the edge. The grand tree to the left. A tawny owl, which I can’t see but hear. And the luminous sky. Stars go back in time, of course. A glance at them and you’re seeing light that left its origin four, 10, hundreds of years ago, thousands for some. A million temporal journeys, and here you are to receive them all. I look at the tower, and at the stars. Think of the twitch of the rodents, and the hiss of the traffic. All parallel lifespans, all intersecting, and all here.

2/18/2022,"This time Eileen Gu didn’t leave things late. After her first two events at the Winter Games came down to nail-biting finishes, the emerging American-born superstar representing China lay waste to all-comers in the Olympic freeski halfpipe final, adding to her big air gold and slopestyle silver to complete an unprecedented hat-trick of medals in the mountains northwest of Beijing. The 18-year-old soared into history on Friday morning in becoming the first action-sports athlete to win three medals at a single Olympics, delivering on years of hype that intensified in the months leading up to the Beijing Games and grew to deafening levels over the past week-and-a-half as her culture-straddling origin story has become the subject of intense public debate on both sides of the Pacific.  Gu pumped her fist after putting down a formidable score of 93.25 on her opening run that none of her rivals would approach, then notched up the difficulty and amplitude on her second trip for a 95.25, creating even more distance atop the leaderboard as hordes of bundled-up spectators and volunteers chanted her name at the bottom of the course. With her second Olympic title in hand after no one came within four and a half points of her benchmark, a beaming Gu made a casual trip down the Secret Garden halfpipe on her final run before gliding into the finish area and mobbing her fellow medalists in celebration. “It has been two straight weeks of the most intense highs and lows I’ve ever experienced in my life,” Gu said. “It has changed my life forever. The second I landed the last 16 in big air I knew my life was never going to be the same. Even then I would have never imagined that I’d walk away with another silver and another gold.” A pair of Canadians filled out the podium as defending Olympic champion Cassie Sharpe won the silver with a best score of 90.75, three points clear of teammate Rachael Karker, who took bronze. The Estonian triple-threat Kelly Sildaru, who turned 20 on Thursday, finished in fourth with a high score of 87.00 on her second run, a fraction of a point out of the medals on a sunny 0C (-18F) morning that offered reprieve from the bitterly cold conditions of the past week. Great Britain’s Zoe Atkin fell on her first two runs but was clean on her final trip and moved up to ninth. Gu’s ability to perform under pressure shone repeatedly in her first two outings. She was in danger of missing the big air final entirely after a ski popped off on her second run, but she confidently landed her last attempt, then won the gold from third place entering her final run by throwing down a 1620, a four-and-a-half-revolution manoeuvre that she had never even attempted in practice. She then avoided a shock exit in Monday’s slopestyle qualifying after an error-strewn opening attempt to make the final, where she surged from eighth place to the silver with a clutch final run that included a double-cork 900 punctuated with a Buick grab. No such dramatics were required in Friday’s halfpipe, Gu’s best event, at Zhangjiakou Genting Snow Park, the sparkling new venue nestled in the tree-lined southern foot of Xiaohaituo Mountain.",Sport/Sport,Eileen Gu soars to hat-trick of medals at Beijing Games with gold in freeski halfpipe ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/18/eileen-gu-soars-to-hat-trick-of-medals-at-beijing-games-with-gold-in-freeski-halfpipe
