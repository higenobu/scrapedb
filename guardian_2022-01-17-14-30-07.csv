1/17/2022,"The countdown to the end of the six-month-long talks in Vienna on the future of the Iran nuclear deal has begun. No deadline has been formally set, but if there is no progress in less than two weeks the process will come to an end leaving a dangerous vacuum. The White House has already been rolling the pitch preparing its political lines for a breakdown by saying the US withdrawal from the agreement by Donald Trump in 2018 has proved to be a disaster. If there is no agreement, the Biden team intend Trump will take the blame.  Ned Price, the US state department spokesperson, warned: “The runway is very, very short – weeks not months.” Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, has given the same time frame but said such are the advances in Iran’s nuclear programme, including levels of uranium enrichment at 60%, faster progress is needed. Those close to the talks say they think there can be an agreement, but that from a western perspective it will possibly be so limited in scope it is will be seen as temporary. If so, as Enrique Mora, the chief EU negotiator has said, it will not be for lack of trying. Surrounded by the gilt of the Palais Coborg hotel in Vienna, the large and expert teams of negotiators meet daily in different permutations delivering non-papers to one another. The one thing that is constant is that Iran refuses to meet the US negotiators, so discussions are carried out indirectly via the European, Chinese and Russian delegations. Full-scale talks will resume on Monday, with both the UK and Germany represented by new chief negotiators, Stephanie Al-Qaq and Tjorven Bellmann respectively. Detail on progress is being kept to a minimum. Mikhail Ulyanov, the Twitter-happy Russian ambassador to the talks and a key interlocutor, occasionally sends out cryptic tweets designed to give a sense of momentum. There are occasional noises off, quite literally. Explosions across western Iran on Saturday night, the Iranian government assured a jumpy nation, were explained by lightning, not an Israeli attack. But the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, has warned his country will not be bound by any agreement. Others are also seeking to influence the balance of forces in Vienna. A cast list of sceptical Gulf ambassadors have shown up to be briefed by the US special envoy, Robert Malley. The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, travelled to China to secure a 25-year partnership agreement, a move designed to show the inflation-wracked Iranian economy can if necessary survive without the west. Ebrahim Raisi, the Iranian president, will travel to Moscow this week with the same purpose. Meanwhile, Evin prison’s terrifying revolving door keeps turning, with Iranians linked to the west being either reprieved or punished. One morning last week, Aras Amiri, a British Council employee, was released to return to the UK – the final hiccup was a Home Office demand she pay £1,000 to renew her expired indefinite leave to remain visa. But later that afternoon it was announced the French-Iranian academic Fariba Adelkhah had her furlough withdrawn and was ordered to return to Evin, a possible punishment for the French being deemed by Iran to be the bad boys of the E3 talks in Vienna. From interviews and briefings Iranian officials have given at home, the sticking points are clear. On lifting sanctions differences remain on how to classify whether a sanction relates to the nuclear deal, and so now should be lifted, or is related to other issues, such as Iranian terrorism or human rights abuses that the US and others say must remain in place. A second issue surrounds the guarantees Iran is seeking that the US will not repeat Trump’s withdrawal from the deal in May 2018. The US cannot offer a legally binding treaty since the Senate would never agree to one. Price said: “There is no such thing as a guarantee in diplomacy and international affairs. We can speak for this administration, but this administration has been very clear that we are prepared to return to full compliance with the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] and to stay in full compliance with the JCPOA as long as Iran does the same.” A UN security council resolution might be a bare minimum of comfort for Iran, but is hardly binding on the parties. Tehran wants binding commitments that if the US quits the deal, the EU will do more to defy secondary US sanctions by injecting real cash into the abortive trading mechanism Instex set up by the EU to bypass US sanctions. A third issue is verification. What are the metrics by which Iran can verify that sanctions have been lifted in reality and not just on paper, and consequently that it must stop enriching uranium at levels of purity not allowed under the agreement? There has been loose talk that the US believes the lifting of sanctions could be verified in 48 hours, but Iran wants a longer process with benchmarks. The final issue is how to handle both the technical knowledge, including advanced centrifuges and large amounts of enriched uranium that Iran has acquired during the period it has ended its commitments to the JCPOA.",News/World news,Iran nuclear talks deadlock risks dangerous vacuum,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/iran-nuclear-talks-deadlock-risks-dangerous-vacuum
1/17/2022,"Depicting a rainswept Paris street, the Nazi-looted painting has long hung on the walls of one of Madrid’s top art museums. Its fate is now in the hands of the highest court in the US, in a case that has long pitted the Spanish institution against the heirs of Jewish refugees. At the centre of the US supreme court hearing, set to begin on Tuesday, is an 1897 painting by impressionist Camille Pissarro. For decades the piece – titled Rue Saint-Honoré in the Afternoon, Effect of Rain – graced the walls of the Cassirer family homes in Berlin and Munich after it was bought directly from Pissarro’s art dealer.  In 1939, as escalating Nazi oppression made it clear the prominent Jewish family would have to leave Germany or risk death, Lilly Cassirer Neubauer scrambled to find a way to leave. She was told that exit visas could be obtained, but at a cost: the family would have to hand over its prized Pissarro painting. A Nazi-appointed appraiser offered a paltry $360, paid into a blocked account that the family was unable to access. Cassirer later spent years searching for the oil on canvas work, according to her heirs. After concluding it had been lost or destroyed, she accepted $13,000 in reparations from the German government in 1958 but did not waive her right to seek the painting’s return. More than 40 years later, her grandson Claude discovered that the painting was on display at Madrid’s Thyssen-Bornemisza museum. After Spain rebuffed his request for its return, he sued in his home state of California, setting off a legal battle that has rumbled on for more than 15 years. When Claude died in 2010, his son David took up the claim. “This has been three generations of the Cassirer family trying to take back what is theirs,” said the family’s attorney, Stephen Zack of the US law firm Boies Schiller Flexner. The turbulent past of the painting, whose value has been estimated at $30m (£22m), is not contested. “Unlike many cases where there is a dispute about the facts, no one disputes the fact that this painting was owned by the Cassirers and was taken by the Nazis without compensation,” said Zack. Instead the legal battle – including the question now being put to the supreme court – has centred on whether California or Spanish law should be used to determine the painting’s rightful owner. The painting changed hands several times before it was bought by Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza in 1976. It subsequently passed to Spain in 1993, when a state-backed non-profit foundation paid the baron $338m for much of his collection, to be installed at a museum bearing his name. In 2015 a California court ruled that ownership of the painting fell under Spanish law, meaning it was property of the museum as per a Spanish clause that defines ownership as six years of uninterrupted possession. The ruling was upheld by an appeals court in 2020. The Cassirers had asked the courts to apply local law. “Under California law, there’s no possibility of a person getting good title to a stolen piece of property,” said Zack. The appeal court, however, chided Spain for failing to abide by its “moral commitments” to return art that had been stolen by the Nazis. “It is perhaps unfortunate that a country and a government can preen as moralistic in its declarations, yet not be bound by those declarations. But that is the state of the law,” read the 2020 ruling. The Thyssen-Bornemisza museum referred all questions to a press note published in October after the US supreme court agreed to hear the case. “At the conclusion of the case … the foundation anticipates that its ownership of the painting – already recognised by the district court and the ninth circuit – will be affirmed,” it said. The museum highlighted the court’s finding that both the baron and the foundation had bought the piece without knowledge that it had been stolen. “The evidence demonstrated that in 1958, the German government paid the plaintiff’s predecessor, Lily [sic] Cassirer, her requested compensation (the then-fair market value of the painting) to compensate her for her loss,” it added. The case comes as heirs around the world continue to fight to reclaim some of the 600,000 artworks looted by Hitler’s Germany. In Spain the main governing bodies of the Jewish community have submitted briefs to the court in support of the Cassirer family, describing the years-long wrangle as exacerbating the deep wounds left by the Holocaust. “Further harm and offence is caused to the Jewish population in Spain when a government-funded institution publicly displays and claims rightful ownership over an artistic work looted by the Nazis during the Holocaust,” the Jewish Community of Madrid and the Federation of Jewish Communities in Spain said in their submission. Bernardo Cremades Román, one of the attorneys representing the organisations, contrasted Spain’s quiet, steadfast refusal to return the painting with the country’s high-profile effort to ease the path of citizenship for the descendants of Jews expelled from Spain in the late 15th century. “I think Spain is trying to put a good face out there.” Reluctance to heed the claim also clashes with Spain’s status as a signatory on the Washington principles, a 1998 agreement pledging to return artwork confiscated by the Nazis to its rightful owners or provide restitution, he noted. “It’s the right thing to do,” said Cremades Román. “If you see someone that’s been stripped of his or her property illegally, the right thing to do is to return that property. Regardless of whether it’s of Jewish nature or not.”",Arts/Art and design,Fate of Nazi-looted Pissarro to be decided by US supreme court,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/17/nazi-looted-pissarro-us-supreme-court
