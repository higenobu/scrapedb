2/5/2022,"To this day, there are still people who think the monkey story is true. That during the Napoleonic wars in the early 19th century, a monkey really did wash up on the Hartlepool shore and was immediately assumed by the credulous townspeople to be a French spy. That the monkey was arrested, questioned, put on trial and – unable to account for its actions – hanged. It’s not true, obviously. I mean, give it a moment’s thought. Hartlepool is a port town. It’s been a trading centre since Roman times. They’re going to know what other people look like. Actually, the monkey legend originates in a music hall song written by Ned Corvan in the 1850s. But part of the reason people still want to believe it is because it verifies their vague caricature of what Hartlepool must be like. A dim backwater. A scared, unworldly place. They thought a monkey was a Frenchman! Hah! No wonder they voted for Brexit.  Even now, on the rare occasions Hartlepool punctures the national news, it tends to be as a source of wacky comedy or half-baked political analysis. Hey, did you hear about the time they chose a man in a monkey costume as their mayor? Hey did you see the club issued an official statement mourning the death of Meat Loaf? Meanwhile, last year’s byelection saw the entire Westminster freakshow descend on the town for 72 hours to emote, nod sagely and point at things. Boris Johnson kicked a football. Keir Starmer drank a pint. Both disappeared within hours. “People here saw through the bullshit, they know what they’re voting for,” says Stuart Drummond. He was the man in the monkey costume, the football club mascot who famously won the inaugural mayoral election in 2002 on a platform of free bananas for schoolchildren. Less well known is what he did next. He cleaned up the town centre. He healed rifts in local government. He was re-elected twice with a larger majority. And of course, the kids got their bananas. “I call it the world’s biggest village,” Drummond says of his home town. “You don’t pass through Hartlepool on your way to anywhere. If you’re there, it’s because you’re from there. We can often be quite scathing about our town, but when someone else says it, we close ranks.” What’s missing, paradoxically, is a town itself. In 2020 the thinktank Onward produced a “social fabric” index ranking local authorities not just on metrics like health and poverty but things like volunteering, public space, trust in politics. Hartlepool came 375th out of 380. Hollowed out by austerity, fractured and forgotten by politicians, people in Hartlepool have essentially been left to fend for themselves. And so, insofar as this town does have a beating heart, a place to come together, it’s football. Which is all the more remarkable when you think about the football club itself. They have never played in the top two divisions. When they won a play-off against Torquay last June to return to the Football League, it was the first trophy of any kind in the club’s history. Hartlepool have spent most of the last century staving off relegation or extinction. They have never been past the fourth round of the FA Cup. That, at least, is something they can now put right. Early on Saturday morning, a convoy of buses will leave Hartlepool for south London, where they will play Crystal Palace for a place in the last 16. All 4,700 away tickets were snapped up within hours. “That shows the type of support this football club’s got,” says centre-half Gary Liddle. “They haven’t had too many good times to enjoy.” For Hartlepool it has been a long road back from the brink. Four years ago, after being relegated to the National League, it was on the edge of ruin until a last-minute takeover by businessman Raj Singh saved it. Now 16th in League Two, things are looking up. Seven new players arrived in January. The academy, which went with the club’s Football League status, is being reopened. The tired, weathered Victoria Park has had a refurb. “We’re no longer embarrassed to bring people here,” says chief operating officer Stephen Hobin. “When I started, it was dilapidated. It didn’t look like a place you’d be proud to work.” The squad has been built around a strong local core, with a former player as its manager in Graeme Lee. “My whole career I’ve wanted to come back in some capacity,” he says. “It’s a family club. We do a lot of work on character. It is difficult sometimes to bring people from the south this far north-east. But the ones we’ve brought in are the right type of people.” For him, playing a Premier League team is a sign of the club’s progress, but he warns his players: “If you swap your shirt, there isn’t a spare one.” Money is still tight, not just at the club but in the region at large. But still they come, 5,000 or more every week, and a noticeably younger demographic too. “It’s a football town,” Hobin says. “There are not many football clubs where 50% of your gate receipts are taken two days before the game. About 1,500 wait until they get paid on Friday afternoon. Then they’ll queue round the block at the ticket office. That’s unheard of.” Drummond, to his great regret, will not be going to London. He and his family are self-quarantining before flying to Australia to start a new life. Of all the things he’ll miss about Hartlepool, football will be felt most keenly of all. “It’s been more hard times than good,” he says. “But you actually become more of a fan when you’re away. I’ll be watching them from afar.” Hartlepool will probably lose. That’s not the point. The point is that in a game becoming ever more unequal and divided, where clubs go to the wall and others scream silently for help, it’s easy to lose yourself in abstracts and numbers. In the wider tableau of English football – trophies, fame, revenue, global footprint – maybe Hartlepool means very little. But to some people, it means everything. Like many stadiums, there is a wall outside Victoria Park containing bricks dedicated by Hartlepool fans, each with a personal engraving. “Pop Bluckert, 1899-1987.” “Lexi Freeman, born 29 Jan 08, Poolie Princess.” “Heslop family, Koh Samui.” “Owbridge/Wilson, 5 generations of Poolies.” Young and old, local and distant, here and departed, every brick tells a story. Every fan matters. Every club matters. It all matters, or none of it does.",Sport/Football,Proud Hartlepool out to storm Palace and rise above the monkey business,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/proud-hartlepool-out-to-storm-palace-and-rise-above-the-monkey-business
2/5/2022,"“Terrific, Mr Mayor. We found the shark!” It has been hard to find any great sense of resolution in the departure this week, by mutually lawyered-up consent, of the head coach, the batting coach and the “managing director” of the England men’s cricket team. In fairness Chris Silverwood never seemed that convinced himself, carrying out his public duties with the fearful, haunted look of a man who only left the house to fetch a pint of milk but finds himself 11 hours later still in his pyjamas, 18 Jägerbombs deep, a tattoo of monkey on his neck, and being asked now to give the opening remarks at a stadium-capacity advanced calculus conference.  Graham Thorpe’s prospects of hanging around pretty much began and ended with the job title “batting coach”. As for Ashley Giles, well, he just had to go. The farewell note listing his apparently unbroken run of successes was telling in itself. And while the idea of Ashley Giles as the dark mastermind behind England cricket’s systemic collapse is unlikely to survive a first meeting with Ashley Giles, the failings of management and indeed directing are clear enough. But it is still important to retain a sense of scale here. Zoom out a little and the idea these departures signify actual change brings to mind that scene in Jaws where a gummy-mouthed tiger shark is strung up on the docks while the furtive and shifty local mayor strides around in his candy-striped jacket announcing that the show is over, the water is now safe, and, hell, this isn’t the time or the place for some kind of half-assed autopsy. This is the time, and it is the place. Because our Great White it still out there. His name is all over the farewell press releases, massaging the message in familiarly nauseating style. It is time to talk, in earnest, about Tom Harrison, a chief executive who professed himself shocked by “the culture” of the England cricket team after seven years in charge of the ECB; who claims to be astonished by systemic racism which anyone with any stake in the sport already knew about; who has overseen years of shrinking back; and who is still, in a note of genuine scandal, intending to take his cut of a £2.1m executive bonus from our shared national sport. This is not news. The story of that planned golden screw-you-all emerged in these pages in August. But we do now have a moment to focus on this. And it matters for reasons that go far beyond cricket. It is a feature of public discourse in these strange times that so much seems to get lost. Selfish, exploitative behaviour raises a howl of dismay, but may then be consumed by other noises, lies, powerlessness, fatigue, a state best described as Johnsonian Dissonance. But the fact is, we don’t have to take this lying down. The ECB will claim it is an employment contract issue. It isn’t. It’s a morality issue. This week it emerged Justin Langer had refused to take his own bonus from Cricket Australia because he felt it was wrong to do so when others were being made redundant. The Harrison bonus scheme was drawn up before the pandemic, before 52 ECB staff lost their jobs, before cricket’s grassroots infrastructure was further imperilled by wider financial collapse. And this is the keynote in this scandal. No body that receives public funding should be spewing out seven-figure executive bonuses. The ECB is given £2.2m each year by Sport England. This taxpayers’ money is awarded on the basis it will be used to nurture the grassroots to a satisfactory degree. The ECB’s own articles of association state that its purpose is “to encourage maximum participation and interest in the sport of cricket”. It has demonstrably failed to do this. The ECB will point to the existence of assorted well-meant schemes, and indeed to the Hundred, as a driver for inclusion, but this is simply eyewash. The Hundred is a piece of IP to secure the future profits of the ECB. To dress it up as a tool for noble causes, to pretend this is the key detail here, would be an act of shameless cynicism. In reality the ECB has overseen an era dominated by those with means and pre-existing access, transforming the shared summer sport into something that is simply invisible to those outside the velvet rope. The idea those who managed this should be rewarded with one last massive payday is simply repugnant. What to do? So far that bonus has been an arch line in an article or an outraged tweet. But this an actual thing. And it should be stopped. Why has it not been mentioned at the ECB’s parliamentary hearings? Sky Sports is the ECB’s key partner. Do they really think this is acceptable? Or that their customers do? The players can’t be happy either given their own pay cuts. Say something, Joe Root. Stand up and condemn this. As for sponsors, do you really want to fund an executive pay scandal? And yes, this is also small fish, a tiger shark affair. The bite radius of Harrison’s bonus does not match the wounds in the water. But this is a string that should be pulled, because it leads directly to the real problem here, the uneasy line between public assets and private enterprise. Here is an entity that embodies perfectly the harm done by allowing our shared sporting institutions to dress themselves up as profit-obsessed limited liability companies. Why not change that? The ECB is only 25 years old. It was called into existence to manage the new pay-TV wealth around the England team, at the time the big issue in the sport. That era has passed. Franchise leagues are the future. The key problem is the basic disappearance of the sport, its barriers to entry, its shrinking relevance. Why not replace the ECB, as the TCCB was replaced, with a body better able to address this landscape?",Sport/Sport,"After all the failings and public money, it’s time to talk about ECB bonuses | Barney Ronay",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/04/after-all-the-failings-and-public-money-its-time-to-talk-about-ecb-bonuses
2/5/2022,"There are myths about Murrayfield that we hear about every year. Some I agree with, some I don’t, but I can honestly say it is a stadium where the conditions can be like nowhere else. It is one of the hardest stadiums to play in because the shape of it means that when the wind gets inside the bowl it just doesn’t stop swirling. The key for England, then, is to get their preparation right. You can try to acclimatise in the warm-up and that does make a difference, but if the players have not got their mental approach right in the buildup it’ll be a long day at the office because the forecast looks dreadful. For me, that would start on a Monday morning. One of the first things I would do is check the weather forecast and from that moment on I was able to start my mental prep.  If rain and wind were predicted I immediately knew that my defence and my aerial skills would be paramount. I would spend time in training honing those skills, or if there wasn’t time within the sessions, I would scrub up on them before or after. I just don’t subscribe to the viewpoint that players can be taken by surprise by the conditions. It has to play a huge part of players’ preparations so you can plan accordingly. I expect that George Ford has been raining spiral bombs down on England’s back-three players all week to get them ready. It’s a tactic that makes the ball so unpredictable in its movements, it disables players from trying to get up into the air, trying to own the space and be protected. That will absolutely help and I fully expect to see him try it if and when he comes off the bench. On top of that, I’m sure Eddie Jones will have had the buckets out, soaking the balls in water. From a coaching point of view, most of them are control freaks by nature but the weather is a variable over which they have no control – except when it comes to the Principality roof – but you can be certain that they will plan for every eventuality to account for that loss of control. To refer to my initial point, however, I’m not sure I buy into the idea that Murrayfield is a particularly daunting place to go. It can be hostile but as a player that is something I would feed off. Those types of gladiatorial atmospheres are exactly what you want as a player and personally speaking, I preferred the emotional response from being booed more than being cheered. There’s no better feeling than being a player away from home and getting booed because, from a performance perspective, the only reason that is happening is because you’re playing well. There is nothing worse than being clapped off, it’s just belittling. Being booed is a mark of respect and I found chasing that feeling a great buzz. If you looked around after the national anthems knowing that it’s you plus 22 other players against 60,000 and it’s only us who can get the job done, it was so empowering. They’ll be loud at Murrayfield, they’ve got missing out on a first win at Twickenham since 1983 to make up for, and now they can get there and enjoy it. My advice to England players sampling it for the first time is to relish it. I believe that they will, and I think they will pip Scotland, but I had two concerns when I saw the team announced. The first is the absence of out-and-out gas without Jonny May on the wing. And the second is size, again a problem largely brought on by injury issues with no Manu Tuilagi. I can’t remember the last time, going into a Calcutta Cup match, that I’ve looked at both lineups and thought the Scotland pack has the physical edge. Not in the front row but these days front-rows can often neutralise each other in terms of what they can do around the park. But in the back five of the scrum, I look at Jonny Gray, Grant Gilchrist, Jamie Ritchie, Hamish Watson and Matt Fagerson and I believe they have the physical edge on paper. We have two teams who want to play flat and fast, and the way you slow that is with gainline and at the breakdown. This Scotland team look better set to impose that defensive game than this England team. Because of that, if England are going to be victorious it’ll be down to their replacements. This is the most inexperienced team Jones has picked in the Six Nations in terms of caps, but by contrast it is the most experienced set of replacements he has selected. Joe Marler, Jamie George, Alex Dombrandt, Ford, Jack Nowell, Harry Randall – that is a bench of huge quality. Sam Simmonds starting ahead of Dombrandt will have been a marginal call but I can see Dombrandt and Randall dovetailing together in the last quarter if Jones looks to up the tempo. The kicking game will be crucial – it always is – but in Max Malins, Freddie Steward and Joe Marchant I believe England can have the edge there. I have doubts about Duhan van der Merwe aerially and it is an area of the game where Ireland and South Africa have both had success at Murrayfield in the past 12 months. They have shown England the blueprint to follow.",Sport/Sport,England must feed off Murrayfield hostility to weather the Scotland storm | Ugo Monye,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/04/england-murrayfield-scotland-storm-wind-six-nations
2/5/2022,"The former Derby chairman Mel Morris has invited Middlesbrough and Wycombe to take their claims to the high court against him personally, in an attempt to remove a major obstacle in the financially stricken club’s attempt to secure a new owner. Morris has proposed to take on the liabilities facing Derby for gaining an advantage at their rivals’ expense to ease the looming threat of liquidation. The Championship club, aided by the sales of players in January, are thought to have enough cash to cover the remainder of this month.  Middlesbrough and Wycombe are seeking compensation worth millions after Derby breached financial rules. Boro missed out on the play-offs in 2018-19 and Wycombe were relegated to League One last season after finishing a point behind Derby. Morris said he has informed Quantuma, the club’s administrator, of his proposal so they can discuss it with all parties, including the English Football League and potential bidders. “I sincerely hope the EFL, Boro and Wycombe will respond urgently and constructively to my proposal to unlock the impasse,” Morris said in a lengthy statement released on Friday. On Thursday the league urged all parties involved to engage in urgent talks to resolve the impasse. Middlesbrough said the administrator had “consistently refused to engage” over their claim since Derby entered administration in September. They have been docked 21 points this season. The manager, Wayne Rooney, has said rivals have “taken advantage” of their plight, with the youngsters Luke Plange, Dylan Williams and Omari Kellyman departing for Crystal Palace, Chelsea and Aston Villa, respectively, during the transfer window. The EFL has made clear it disagrees with the administrator’s view that, under insolvency legislation, the club could avoid defending Middlesbrough and Wycombe’s claims and that they should not be treated as football-related debts. “MFC has always maintained that its claim against Derby County is a football-related debt and that it should be treated as such,” read a Middlesbrough statement in response to the league. “MFC welcomes the EFL’s confirmation that it shares this view. If the administrators believe that the EFL are not entitled to take this stance, MFC has offered to refer the matter to a judge to decide.” The EFL has, however, maintained that the compensation claims are one of a number of issues that require attention. Derby owe HM Revenue & Customs £29.3m and about £20m to MSD Holdings, an investment firm owned by Michael Dell, via loans secured against Pride Park, the stadium Morris owns. Arsenal are also owed instalments for the £8m transfer of Krystian Bielik, Derby’s club-record signing. The club lease their Moor Farm training base from the Locko Estate. An EFL spokesperson said: “The EFL notes the comments published and the proposal tabled by Mr Morris this evening. It will now review in detail before considering its position and determining an appropriate response. In the meantime, as per Thursday’s statement, the offer to engage with Mr Morris and all other stakeholders remains in place as we seek to find the compromises required to protect Derby County in the long-term. The league will not be commenting any further on this specific matter at the current time.”",Sport/Football,Former Derby chairman invites clubs to make compensation claims against him,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/former-derby-chairman-invites-clubs-to-make-compensation-claims-against-him
2/5/2022,"New details have emerged about a 22-year-old Black man who was fatally shot by Minneapolis police during the execution of a no-knock warrant, with police officials confirming the man was not named in any search warrant. During a press conference on Thursday held by the Minneapolis police department (MPD), officials confirmed that Amir Locke, who was shot early on Wednesday morning during the search, was not named in any search warrant carried out by MPD police. Locke was shot by the Minneapolis officer Mark Hanneman, according to city officials and documents.  “My son was executed on 2-2 of 22,” said Karen Wells, Locke’s mother, during a press conference on Friday. “And now his dreams have been destroyed.” The video of the police shooting, which was also released on Thursday, seemed to contradict early claims from police officials that officers had “loudly made themselves known before entering the apartment”, where Locke was. The video instead showed officers announcing their presence once they were already inside the apartment. The video released by the Minneapolis police department shows officers entering the apartment unit by unlocking the door with a key, shouting “police, search warrant, get on the ground, get on the fucking ground,” as they entered the unit, reported Reuters. An officer then kicks a couch Locke was lying on underneath a blanket, appearing to wake Locke up. Locke, who was holding a handgun, looks up to see officers surrounding him and begins to stand, with the handgun becoming visible. Almost immediately, officers fired three shots, killing Locke, who was still twisted up in the blanket. Locke’s parents, Andre Locke and Karen Wells, initially declined to comment on the video, with his mother telling the Star Tribune on Thursday, “We want justice for our son.” In a press conference on Friday, Locke’s parents spoke more about their son, noting that he had no criminal record and had multiple relatives working in law enforcement. Wells said the couple had talked to their son on how to act around police and to do “what they needed to do whenever they encountered police officers” given the danger to “unarmed Black males”. Nekima Levy Armstrong, a community organizer and a civil rights attorney, said that Locke’s family told her that Locke was a registered gun owner with a conceal carry permit who did not live in the apartment and was not being searched for by police, reported CBS. Armstrong also confirmed that Locke was not named in the search warrant carried out on Wednesday. Hanneman was hired by the MPD in 2015 and had received three complaints that were all closed with disciplinary action, according to city records. A fourth complaint from 2018 was also recorded, according to data collected by the Communities United Against Police Brutality organization, reports CBS. Hanneman has been placed on administrative leave, which is routine, pending an investigation. The family is being represented by the civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who has previously worked with the families of police shooting victims, including the family of George Floyd. In a statement, Crump compared the shooting of Locke to the 2020 killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, during a police raid. “Like the case of Breonna Taylor, the tragic killing of Amir Locke shows a pattern of no-knock warrants having deadly consequences for Black Americans,” said Crump. “This is yet another example of why we need to put an end to these kinds of search warrants so that one day, Black Americans will be able to sleep safely in their beds at night.”",News/US news,Black man killed by Minneapolis police was not named in no-knock warrant,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/04/amir-locke-police-minneapolis-no-knock-warrant
2/5/2022,"Greetings card designers are being urged to stop using pugs and other flat-faced dogs and cats on Valentine’s Day cards as those sold by big retailers show how popular such images remain despite animal cruelty warnings from vets. The British Veterinary Association (BVA) has written to the Greeting Card Association and card retailers, including Moonpig, Paperchase, WH Smith, Scribbler, Clinton’s and Funky Pigeon, reigniting a call to action it first made four years ago to ban such images.  Its #HugsNotPugs campaign is aimed at curbing a worrying demand for flat-faced pets. The BVA believes using images of pugs on cards and gifts is normalising these breeds’ short noses and big eyes, which can cause pain for the animal and prove costly for the owner to treat. Despite raising the alarm in 2018 with its #BreedtoBreathe campaign, the BVA said there had still been no real change on the ground, and a look at Valentine’s Day cards in the shops this year throws up a similar array of animals bred for “cute” looks, it said. The BVA’s president, Justine Shotton, said: “Flat-faced dogs and cats like pugs, French bulldogs and Persians and ‘long and low’ breeds like dachshunds continue to remain popular on greetings cards and gifts this Valentine’s Day, even four years after vets started the #BreedToBreathe campaign. “These animals add a ‘cute’ appeal to merchandise but their looks mask a host of potential health and welfare problems. Valentine’s Day is a day for showing love, so giving a gift or card depicting an animal that can suffer because of how it has been bred is not the right message to give a loved one. That is why we are asking everyone to choose hugs not pugs to show your love this year. “Some card retailers and associations engaged with us when we wrote to them back in 2018, but, sadly, we have yet to see any real change. While stock for this year is already in the shops, we hope that card retailers will work with BVA to reduce the visibility and, hopefully, the popularity of these breeds in the future.” More than half of the brachycephalic dogs and a quarter of the brachycephalic cats that vets see need treatment for health issues related to how they look, according to the BVA’s Voice of the Veterinary Profession survey. In a letter sent to retailers, Shotton wrote: “Animals with extreme features who have been bred for looks over regard for their health have boomed in popularity over recent years, fuelled by the media, celebrities and the use of these animals in merchandising and advertising. “These are breeds that struggle with serious and often life-limiting health problems. For example, dogs and cats with short muzzles (pugs, French bulldogs and Persians, among others) can struggle to breathe and can also suffer from a range of other problems including eye ulcers, skin infections and spinal abnormalities. “We appreciate that the images on your cards are meant to be fun, however, we fear that further visibility of flat-faced dogs and cats or ‘long and low’ pets will only create higher demand for the animals.”",News/UK news,Vets call for end to use of flat-faced dogs on greeting cards,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/vets-call-for-end-to-use-of-flat-faced-dogs-on-greeting-cards
2/5/2022,"The former Labour peer Nazir Ahmed has been jailed for five years and six months after being convicted of sexual offences against two children in the 1970s. The 64-year-old, who quit the House of Lords but retains the title Lord Ahmed of Rotherham, was found guilty at Sheffield crown court in January of serious sexual assault against a boy aged 11 at the time, and twice attempting to rape a girl, when he was a teenager.  On Friday, Mr Justice Lavender told Ahmed: “Your actions have had profound and lifelong effects on the girl and the boy, who have lived with what you did to them for between 46 and 53 years. “Their statements express more eloquently than I ever could how your actions have affected their lives in so many different and damaging ways.” The survivor of the attempted rapes read her own victim personal statement in court, saying: “An overwhelming feeling of shame remained with me throughout my childhood and early adult years. “It was a burden I was made to carry, and it silenced me for many years. It is now time for me to pass that burden to him – the paedophile who I know feels no personal shame.” Ahmed’s two older brothers, Mohammed Farouq, 71, and Mohammed Tariq, 66, were also charged with indecent assault in relation to the same boy abused by Ahmed. Both men were deemed unfit to stand trial, but a jury found that they carried out the acts alleged. Farouq and Tariq were both given absolute discharges after the judge said the only other two options – a hospital order or a supervision order – would not be appropriate in this case. A victim personal statement from the male complainant read in court said being sexually abused by the three men had “affected me on a daily basis” and left him unable to show affection to his own children. He said: “I buried the abuse and carried it with me on my own for years and years. I feel shame because of what these men did to me. This is not about revenge, this is about justice.” In mitigation, Imran Khan QC said Ahmed had devoted his life to public service and that his “fall from grace” had been “in the full glare of publicity” including a campaign for him to be stripped of his title. The judge said that according to legal guidelines, the sentence must be in line with what would have been imposed at the time the offence was committed. He jailed Ahmed for three-and-a-half years for the offence of buggery, and imposed two concurrent sentences of two years for each of the attempted rapes. Buggery was the legal term for the specific sexual assault at the time of the offences. Lavender also adjourned the case for six weeks to determine whether Ahmed could pay prosecution costs. During the trial, the prosecutor Tom Little QC said Ahmed claimed the allegations were a “malicious fiction” but a recording of a 2016 phone conversation between the two victims showed they were not “made up or concocted”. Appointed a life peer by Tony Blair, Ahmed resigned from the Labour party in 2013. He then resigned from the House of Lords in November 2020 after a conduct committee report found he sexually assaulted a vulnerable woman who sought his help. The report made him the first peer to be recommended for expulsion, but he resigned before this could be implemented. The male victim, known as Mr B to protect his anonymity, told BBC Newsnight on Thursday that Ahmed should be stripped of his title, which can be done only by an act of parliament. “That title is bestowed upon people that have got some honour, some dignity, and he’s got none of that,” he said. “I’m demanding the government take that peerage away from him.” The House of Lords confirmed that, as the title is created by letters patent from the Queen, it has no power to remove it and legislation would therefore be needed to strip Ahmed of it.",News/UK news,Peer Nazir Ahmed jailed for sexual offences against children,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/peer-nazir-ahmed-jailed-for-sexual-offences-against-children
2/5/2022,"Boris Johnson’s attempts to rally his dilapidated top team floundered on Friday after a second cabinet minister distanced himself from the prime minister and another Conservative MP called for him to go. In a bid to shore up support, Johnson wrote to MPs promising them a “direct line to Downing Street”, but his move came as Sajid Javid followed the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in rejecting Johnson’s remarks linking Starmer with the failure to prosecute paedophile Jimmy Savile.  The health secretary said Starmer had done “a good job” as director of public prosecutions and that “he should be respected for it”. Javid said he was glad Johnson had “clarified” his remarks – though the prime minister has not apologised. Sunak said of Johnson’s comments on Thursday: “I wouldn’t have said it.” The attempt to smear Starmer led to the departure of Johnson’s longstanding policy chief, Munira Mirza, on Thursday. In another sign of Johnson’s waning authority, Newcastle-under-Lyme MP Aaron Bell became the ninth Tory backbencher to confirm publicly that he had submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister. “The breach of trust that the events in Downing Street represent, and the manner in which they have been handled, makes [Johnson’s] position untenable,” Bell said in a statement on Friday. The MP was widely believed to have submitted a letter after he challenged the prime minister in the House of Commons on Monday. Bell told MPs he had followed the lockdown rules meticulously, driving three hours each way to his grandmother’s funeral without hugging his family or stopping for a cup of tea, and asked pointedly: “Does the prime minister think I’m a fool?” If 54 letters are sent to the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, a vote of no confidence will be called – and if Johnson loses it, his premiership will be over. Some senior Tory MPs believe the total number of letters may be close to 40, though the total is never made public until the threshold is reached. More are likely to when details emerge of whether Downing Street staff have been fined for breaching lockdown rules. The Met is investigating a dozen parties in Downing Street and Whitehall and has been handed a bundle of evidence including 300 photographs. One person who has seen some of them said, “It looked like a party to me”, adding that they would not be surprised if up to 20 No 10 staff ended up being given fixed penalty notices. Johnson sought to placate Conservative MPs on Friday with a conciliatory letter detailing plans to include them in future policymaking. He is also planning a policy blitz next week, according to government sources, with announcements expected “pretty much every day”, including on health and a potential overseas trip for discussions on the crisis in Ukraine. Johnson flew to Ukraine earlier this week, and No 10 subsequently released a publicity video about the trip with a movie-style soundtrack. This week also saw the publication of the long-awaited levelling-up white paper and Sunak’s cost of living measures, but Downing Street has struggled to wrench the headlines away from the ongoing chaos in No 10. Johnson told MPs in his letter: “I understand the deep importance of engaging with colleagues in parliament and listening to your views, and that is why I want colleagues to have a direct line into 10 Downing Street,” he wrote. “I promised change and this is what we will now deliver together.” One former cabinet minister said they believed the departures from the PM’s team on Thursday evening – which left him without a director of communications, a principal private secretary or a chief of staff – could hasten Johnson’s own exit. “The mass exodus is obviously bad for Boris and may bring forward decision day,” they said. Another former minister said: “I think there are probably a lot of people who are going to be wrestling with their consciences over the weekend.” They said the exodus from Downing Street “all looks a little bit like panic”. Elena Narozanski, a special adviser to the prime minister on women and equalities, culture, media and sport and extremism, became the fifth aide to depart on Friday morning. Johnson’s spokesman said new appointments would be made “in the coming days”. Some MPs say they are awaiting for these before judging whether Johnson has fulfilled the promise he made to overhaul his top team. One Tory insider said the situation was “very fluid” but that No 10 would want to make the appointments before the weekend was out. Among those being tipped for a communications job are Simon McGee, a former Foreign Office press head, and the current press secretary, Rosie Bate-Williams. For more strategic roles, insiders suggested David Canzini, an ally of Lynton Crosby, and Ross Kempsell, a senior political operator at Conservative campaign headquarters. Lord Frost has already made clear that he will not come back into the fold while the National Insurance rise is going ahead, and former aides Lord Lister and Will Walden are also thought to be resistant to returning. Another senior figure in communications said he had turned down the job previously and would not go to a “sinking ship”. The prime minister gathered No 10 staff in the cabinet room for a pep talk on Friday morning, quoting the Lion King to tell them “change is good”, after five members of his senior team, including Mirza, had quit in the space of less than 24 hours. Johnson’s spokesman said: “He reflected on the privilege of working in No 10 in order to deliver for the British people and reiterated his and No 10’s commitment to serving the public by keeping people safe, improving lives and spreading opportunity.”",News/Politics,Johnson struggles to rally team as pressure on him builds up,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/boris-johnson-struggles-to-rally-team-as-pressure-on-him-builds-up
2/5/2022,"MJ, a megawatt new jukebox musical on Michael Jackson which opened on Broadway this week, is from the outset a dubious proposition. There is, first of all, the challenge of finding new things to say about an artist who is both ubiquitous – his music and dancing elemental to modern pop – and famously inscrutable. And then there’s the permanent stain on any mention of Jackson’s legacy: the allegations of child sexual abuse, detailed at length in the disturbing, meticulous 2019 HBO documentary Leaving Neverland. (The Jackson estate, which collaborated on the development of MJ the Musical, vehemently denies all allegations; Jackson was acquitted of child molestation in 2005.) If your head is not in the sand, there’s no way to enter the Neil Simon Theatre without a load of uncomfortable baggage.  MJ the Musical, directed and choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon from a book by the Pulitzer-winning dramatist Lynn Nottage, mostly ignores that baggage via an electric and absorbing spin through Jackson’s career. It’s a rollicking parade of hits, vocal high points, and a sanitized spin through Jackson’s life that sketches demons without filling them in. It’s also a discomfiting experience, in both what’s obviously left off-stage (this is a commercial Broadway musical which ejected a Variety reporter for asking cast about the allegations at the premiere) and its portrayal of Michael Jackson as a lonely Peter Pan in turmoil. The tone is triumphant; the story is a tragedy. MJ opens in 1992, in the final rehearsals for the Dangerous tour, a decision which bypasses many of Jackson’s infamous tabloid stories – the hyperbaric chamber, Bubbles the chimp, his disappearing nose; also the molestation trial and his death from a cocktail of prescription medications in 2009. MJ (an outstanding Myles Frost), as his team calls him, is on edge, making extensive last-minute edits played for uneasy laughs. Unbeknown to him, his tour manager, Rob (Quentin Earl Darrington, who doubles as Joe Jackson), has permitted an MTV journalist, Rachel (Whitney Bashor), and a cameraman, Alejandro (Gabriel Ruiz), to film rehearsals. The tension is obvious – the dancers are overworked (yet still sinuous, enjoyable to watch), the tour is hemorrhaging funds and MJ is reliant on painkillers. As Rachel presses, MJ begins to reflect on his life, prompting several seamless, Technicolor flashback sequences that lift the pall of what we now know about Jackson. There’s Little Michael (an excellent Christian Wilson, and in other performances Walter Russell III) in the Jackson 5, coaxed into the spotlight by his older brothers, abusive and demeaning father Joe, and pliant mother Katherine (Ayana George, whose stunning voice prompted cheers from the audience multiple times). There’s Motown and Soul Train and teenage Michael (a remarkable Tavon Olds-Sample) busting at the seams with creative energy and insecurities; there’s Quincy Jones (Apollo Levine) and Thriller and the eight Grammys and Bad. This roll through the hits, like Jackson the pop star, casts an alluring spell. At the performance I attended, audience shouts of “Sing it!” and “Whew!” peppered the performance, the magic of Jackson’s art, even when embodied by others, still that potent. The spectacle is effective; a reimagining of Thriller as a haunted carnival of MJ’s psychological demons – the toll of perfectionism and the ghosts of bad ideologies with a phantasmagoric Joe Jackson presiding – brought the house down. Sound design by Gareth Owen layered a bass so thick I thought it gave me a heart arrhythmia (in a good way). Orchestration and arrangement by Jason Michael Webb and David Holcenberg, lighting by Natasha Katz, and costumes Paul Tazewell are Technicolor, whimsical and exact. If you can forget, it’s a fun ride. As for that forgetting: it’s not total. There’s no mention of “abuse” but there is a demand from a reporter in a scrum – “What do you have to say about the recent allegations?” – wedged in with questions about his tour, fame and plastic surgery. But it’s a small out – the elephant in the room cast in the dimmest light, nodded at once or twice. Though the musical – and the audience, in the show I attended, as I imagine all the others – are firmly on the side of Jackson as the hero and creative visionary, there are glimpses of different visions: Jackson the mercurial star on the wane, the addict, the unreasonable boss, the eerily childish adult, the exacting perfectionist, the pop star who spent lavishly and traveled with an unusual entourage. “Who is this family he wants to bring on tour?” a member of his beleaguered staff asks, the other moment when the script gestures to the shadow looming overhead. Frost accomplishes the impressive feat of embodying the King of Pop – moonwalk, willowy yet commanding presence, delicate voice – as both haunted human and alien, unsure what it means to love and live. His MJ is a fragile stress ball, an electric performer and a strange creature. “I want to keep this about my music,” he tells Rachel in one interview, when she presses on his feelings. MJ the Musical is bound by design and collaboration with the estate to that request, honored to at times mesmerizing, ultimately discomforting effect. Certainly many viewers will abide by the same compartmentalization and have a guiltless good time, and others, myself included, will find that impossible.",Arts/Stage,MJ the Musical review – mesmerizing parade of hits doesn’t look in the mirror,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/04/mj-the-musical-review-broadway
2/5/2022,"Stuart Hogg, on the eve of his ninth Calcutta Cup game, was reminded it is now 10 years since his first thrilling foray into the wider sporting conscience. A Friday night in Galashiels saw the then 19-year-old dance his way to a 60m try for the Scotland A side against England Saxons, the highlight of a thumping 35-0 win for the hosts.  A week later Hogg was propelled on to the bench for the senior Scotland side in Cardiff and made his Test debut as a replacement on the right wing. “It’s quite scary that was 10 years ago already,” he says. “It means that I’m getting old. I’ve absolutely loved it and it’s been a good journey so far but I’m far from finished.” In many ways Hogg – and Scotland – are just getting started. An international career that has brought 88 Scotland caps so far and three Lions tours began with four straight defeats. That was the way it was with Scotland back then: sporadic victories which ignited hope, swiftly dashed. At 29, and embarking on his 11th Six Nations campaign, Hogg has no hesitation in declaring this the “best squad I’ve ever been involved in”. The Exeter full-back lost his first five Calcutta Cup matches from 2013 to 2017, the latter a record 61-21 shellacking at Twickenham. But he has won two of his last three – he missed the helter-skelter 38-38 draw in 2019 with injury – and believes there is no longer any fear in the home ranks when the red rose ranks come calling. “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t used to worry about playing England, especially in the early years,” he says. “For me growing up some of the names that used to play against us made playing them quite a scary task. But not now. I truly believe in the ability of myself and of the squad. I believe that we can go out there and win.” On and off the field the mood music is overwhelmingly upbeat. Scotland have become an increasingly competitive Six Nations force because allied to the attacking razzle-dazzle, under the guidance of Steve Tandy – “the best defence coach in world rugby” according to Hogg – they now enjoy keeping the opposition out too. Since the Welshman came in after the 2019 World Cup Scotland have conceded 28 tries in 18 Tests, an average of 1.56. “Because he cares so much, the boys love defending and love going out there to show what it means to represent our country, and that’s down to Steve as a person,” Hogg says. Scotland start with seven-eighths of the pack that won at Twickenham for the first time in 38 years a year ago, and an unchanged backline from the one which finished the autumn series. It is a settled side with a host of players in their mid-to-late 20s who are close to, or already at, their peak. Eight of the starting XV toured with the Lions last summer and all but one, Zander Fagerson, saw Test action. Such was the impact of Finn Russell’s performance in the third Test, it was easy to imagine the series outcome might have been different if the fly-half had been fit to take a full part. “Finn is absolute quality,” Hogg says. “He cares deeply about this sport and about getting the best out of himself. When he’s firing and he’s got a forward pack going forward, he is one of the best 10s in world rugby. I’m sure England will have a strategy to try and keep him quiet, but I’m sure he’ll find ways in and around that to have a big impact on the game.” Hogg sees shades of Russell in the man charged with lighting England’s fires amid what are likely to be wet and windy conditions at Murrayfield. Hogg has seen enough of Marcus Smith already to believe he will “thrive” on the biggest stages, and was similarly effusive in his admiration for Exeter teammate Henry Slade –“someone else who makes the game of rugby look incredibly easy”. But behind the pre-match diplomacy, there is no mistaking the overriding mood in the home ranks. Anything less than victory today will be a major disappointment. “We’re confident in what we’re going to do, we’re confident that the challenges England chuck at us we know we can deal with,” Hogg adds. “It’s just about going out there and executing it the best we possibly can.”",Sport/Sport,Stuart Hogg has high hopes for ‘best Scotland squad he has been in’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/stuart-hogg-has-high-hopes-for-best-scotland-squad-he-has-been-in
2/5/2022,"A controversial Tennessee pastor led a book burning on Wednesday night to fight “demonic influences”, with a crowd incinerating copies of books including Harry Potter and Twilight. The burning, which was livestreamed on Facebook, followed last month’s decision by a Tennessee school district to ban the Holocaust-based graphic novel Maus.  “We are well aware what we are stepping into. Bring it all. Stop allowing demonic influences into your home,” pastor and pro-Trump conspiracy theorist Greg Locke wrote in a Facebook post that has since been removed. “We will be in our continued series on Deliverance from Demons. We have stuff coming in from all over that we will be burning. We’re not playing games. Witchcraft and accursed things must go,” wrote Locke. Locke’s event in the Nashville suburb of Mt. Juliet drew large crowds as participants threw in copies of the Harry Potter and Twilight series , among other books. Prior to the burning, Locke said in a sermon that he was fighting the “Free Mason devils” and that “I ain’t gonna be suiciding myself no time soon”. “I ain’t messing with witches no more, I ain’t messing with witchcraft…I ain’t messing with demons… I’ll call all of them out in the name of Jesus Christ,” said Locke, as crowds of attendees cheered and applauded in response. According to Tyler Salinas, a photographer who was present at the bonfire, there was one counter-protester, who held up copies of Fahrenheit 451 and On the Origin of Species, and threw a book into the fire that he said was the Bible. The American Library Association said it has recently seen an “unprecedented” rise in book ban requests: it counted 330 books that were challenged as objectionable in the fall of 2021 compared to 156 in all of 2020. “In my twenty years with ALA, I can’t recall a time when we had multiple challenges coming in on a daily basis,” said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, the director of ALA’s Office for Intellectual Freedom.",News/US news,Tennessee pastor leads burning of Harry Potter and Twilight novels,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/04/book-burning-harry-potter-twilight-us-pastor-tennessee
2/5/2022,"The Professional Cricketers Association (PCA) will become the latest members of cricket’s hierarchy to give evidence to parliament’s DCMS committee over the racism scandal that erupted at Yorkshire CCC but has touched the entire sport. The session, to be held next Tuesday, will be the third time cricket has been forced to sit down in front of Julian Knight’s panel in as many months. It follows Azeem Rafiq’s original testimony in November last year, and appearances from the ECB’s Tom Harrison and county chairs – Mike O’Farrell et al – last month.  The PCA representatives – James Harris, the union’s chair, Anuj Dal, the vice-chair, Julian Metherell, the non-executive chair, and Rob Lynch, the chief executive – are expected to be asked about the support they provided to Rafiq during his period of conflict with Yorkshire, which has since resulted in a mea culpa financial settlement from the club and an overhaul of its leadership under new chair, Kamlesh Patel. In his evidence to the DCMS committee last November, Rafiq described the PCA’s response as “incredibly inept”, claiming that the union had refused to support him as he sought legal redress against Yorkshire for institutional racism, and that they only checked on his health during a period when he was suicidal due to “box-ticking”. Rafiq went on to say “The PCA kept telling me when the report comes out, they would support me. Once it did, they said we have no powers, we can just push the ECB. An organisation that should have been there for me and supported me left me to fight on my own.” The committee is also expected to explore the PCA’s involvement in the ECB’s 12-point plan to combat racism which it has embarked upon as it attempts to act upon the issues raised by Rafiq. The situation at Yorkshire also reared its head during Friday’s post-Ashes cull briefing at Lord’s. Tom Harrison was asked about the latest situation at Headingley, following the cancellation of the club’s EGM and Lord Patel’s claims that individuals were trying to derail reform at the club. Harrison said: “We had a board meeting on Tuesday and a delegation came down from Yorkshire to give us a very comprehensive presentation on the progress that Lord Patel and his team have made in the very short time that they have been in charge of YCCC. “The only reflection I would have on the stuff overnight – and believe it or not I haven’t spent a lot of time looking at it because there’s been a few other things going on – but I would just reflect on a broader note that any suggestion that there is not a problem with racism in Yorkshire is a cause for great concern.” In an email to members sent on 2 February, Yorkshire CCC made it clear that they intended to hold a further EGM before the end of this month.",Sport/Sport,Cricketers’ union called to give evidence to DCMS committee on racism scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/cricketers-union-called-to-give-evidence-to-dcms-committee-on-racism-scandal
2/5/2022,"An Oxford college’s three and a half year battle to oust its dean amid claims of scandalous behaviour, unsound judgment, avarice and sexual harassment has ended in a settlement involving a substantial payoff. Martyn Percy, the dean of Christ Church, will step down voluntarily from his position after a mediation process, the college said in a statement. An allegation of sexual harassment has been settled, and an employment tribunal scheduled for next year will not go ahead.  The college will pay a “substantial” sum in compensation to Percy and reimburse his legal costs, the dean’s supporters said. The college has also agreed to an independent review of its governance. The dispute, which began with Percy’s suspension in 2018, has cost millions of pounds and caused serious reputational damage to the 476-year-old college, which has produced 13 British prime ministers, 10 chancellors of the exchequer and 17 archbishops. In December, Lord Patten, a former cabinet minister who is now chancellor of Oxford university, said the “protracted and ongoing dispute” was damaging the university’s reputation. In 2020, the Charity Commission also said the dispute was “damaging to the reputation of [the college], and affecting its ability to govern itself”. The statement from Christ Church, issued on Friday, said “a resolution has been reached that is acceptable to all parties” after mediation “to resolve a number of outstanding issues” between the dean and the college’s governing body. It added: “The individual who made the allegation of sexual harassment against the dean has agreed to settle her claim in terms which on her request are confidential.” It was alleged that the dean briefly stroked and commented on the hair of an unidentified woman, an allegation that Percy denied. In a separate statement, the woman said: “I am pleased that the dean has agreed to step down … and, in return, I have agreed to settle my outstanding claims against him.” She thanked Christ Church for supporting her right to make a complaint. In a statement, Percy said: “While the past four years have often been harrowing, I have drawn great comfort from the unwavering support from colleagues, alumni and friends … Christ Church has been around for nearly 500 years and I sincerely hope it flourishes for many centuries to come. I hope the independent review overseen by the Charity Commission will succeed. “I sincerely hope that the same standards in public life we have come to expect of our most cherished national institutions – including integrity, transparency and accountability – will flourish and bear fruit here.” One of Percy’s supporters accused the college of conducting a “witch hunt” against Percy. Another said the dispute had “riven the college, cost millions of pounds and caused untold distress, unhappiness and harm to those caught up in it”. At the heart of the dispute was Percy’s pay and his efforts to reform the college’s governance. He was originally suspended after being accused of behaviour of an “immoral, scandalous or disgraceful nature”, the wording of the college’s statutes under which a dean can be removed. The college hired Sir Andrew Smith, a retired high court judge, to chair a tribunal on the dispute. After a hearing behind closed doors on June 2019, Smith dismissed all 27 complaints against Percy and ordered his reinstatement. However, efforts by the governing body to remove Percy from his post continued. As well as enormous legal fees, the dispute is believed to have cost the college millions in cancelled bequests and donations. Percy, who was appointed in 2014, will step down in April.",News/Education,Oxford college dean steps down after settlement reached in three-year dispute,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/04/oxford-college-dean-steps-down-after-settlement-reached-in-three-year-dispute
2/5/2022,"For many months, the man on the motorbike would come and go from the house and a mechanic’s workshop in the Syrian border town of Atme. No other adult in the three-story building ever seemed to emerge, least of all a second man who signed a lease last spring and moved in with two women and three young children, never to be seen publicly again until the early hours of Thursday.  By then, both men were dead, the mechanic in the room he shared with his wife on the ground floor, and the phantom who lived above him – one of the most wanted men in the world – lying on a lawn outside. The violent end of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, leader of the Islamic State, met little public reaction online among the group’s members, in contrast to the fanfare that followed the death of his predecessor, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, just a short distance away two years ago. But among the small working-class enclave surrounded by olive trees and camps for displaced people, a stone’s throw from Turkey, it was the talk of the town. “We never saw his face,” said local resident Abdullah Amin. “The guy downstairs, however, we saw a lot. He had a place to fix cars in town and people used to go to him.” The suspicion among locals, partly corroborated by regional security sources, is that the unnamed man was a lieutenant for Qurayshi, receiving and passing on messages from couriers who arrived in Atme. In the wake of the prison break last month in Hasakah on the other side of Syria, messages are believed to have been delivered more frequently. Qurayshi is understood to have played some role in the attack and to have received regular updates about its progress. It was to be the last such audacious plot to be launched under his leadership. “There were several security lapses on his behalf along the way,” said an official with knowledge of the operation to kill him. “But the most important one was recently.” Locals who spoke to the Guardian say there were no signs of strangers in town and no hint that the IS leader was hiding among them. “We are still shocked,” said Amir. “I live a short distance from that house and I did not have a clue.” Rescue workers and local militants continued to scour through the partially ruined home on Friday, in a search of body parts and clues to the violent explosion that is thought to have caused the bulk of the casualties. US president Joe Biden said Qurayshi had detonated a bomb that killed him and his family, and blast damage, as well as blood splatter inside the home, adds some weight to that view. However, skepticism of the US account lingered, fuelled in part by a lethal drone attack in Afghanistan that killed 10 civilians, including seven children, in the wake of last summer’s chaotic withdrawal. “There were helicopters and planes and there was shooting … but there was also an explosion inside the house,” said Amir. A second Atme resident, a volunteer with the first responder organisation, the White Helmets, said several bodies of women and children had been taken to a forensic institute in nearby Idlib. The Pentagon claims that the US army Delta Force unit that carried out the raid was able to extricate 10 women, children and babies from the building before opening fire, and that only three children were killed. However, local reports say that 13 people, including six children, were killed, and observers who saw photographs of the dead said there were signs to suggest some were killed by heavy-calibre rounds. There is also controversy over whether the two members of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who were shot at the scene as the US soldiers were leaving, had opened fire on the departing helicopters. The Pentagon has said it will review the evidence. The raid took place less than a week after the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, ordered a comprehensive review of US posture towards protecting civilians in conflict. HTS members took the bodies of Qurayshi and his family from the scene. It is not known what happened to them. Before HTS moved in, keeping bystanders away from the scene, US forces were able to take a DNA sample from Qurayshi’s body to match against a sample they had stored from his days as a prisoner in Iraq. Qurayshi spent several years in the US detention centre, Camp Bucca, in southern Iraq, where he earned a reputation as an informant, who passed on information to his captors to lead them to eliminate his rivals. “Having this guy living here is strange,” said Momammed Mahmoud, an Atme grocer. “There wasn’t a clue about him being in town. There are checkpoints on three sides of town and none of [the militants] who run them like Isis. We would rather be known for different reasons.”",News/World news,‘We are still shocked’: the Syrians who discovered Islamic State’s leader was their neighbour,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/we-are-still-shocked-the-syrians-who-discovered-islamic-states-leader-was-their-neighbour
2/5/2022,"Before the end of the last school year, the principal of Brisbane’s Citipointe Christian College, Brian Mulheran, brought his teaching staff together and asked them to pray. Multiple teachers recall how Mulheran ran a PowerPoint presentation that listed the key elements of the federal government’s proposed religious freedom bill. As he went through them in turn, he led staff in a prayer that each measure would be enacted in 2022.  Citipointe college and its principal jumped the gun this week, attempting to force families to sign enrolment contracts that contained anti-gay and anti-trans provisions that lawyers say likely breached Queensland’s existing anti-discrimination laws. Mulheran initially framed it as “a legitimate exercise in religious freedom” but by the end of the week, the attempt to enforce the contracts – and some say momentum for the government’s religious freedom laws – had collapsed. In the process, what has become increasingly clear is the extent to which Citipointe – both the Pentecostal megachurch and its school – has promoted conservative political activism alongside what it preaches. A Guardian Australia investigation has discovered extensive links to the Liberal National party, including church figures who are significant LNP donors; attempts by churchgoers to infiltrate party branches; and overt political campaigning by the church’s leadership. Brisbane’s south-east is often called the city’s bible belt; brick and tile houses built in the 1960s and 70s, where several Pentecostal and Baptist churches brought God to the suburbs soon after the first major housing developments. In 2018, when the Queensland parliament decriminalised abortion in the state, one of the local LNP MPs, Steve Minnikin, voted with his conscience and supported the bill. Text messages, shown to Guardian Australia this week, sent among Citipointe churchgoers in the months after the vote, listed the nearby suburbs within Minnikin’s electorate and sought people there who were “willing to get political and fight back”. By February 2019, more than 40 new or transferring members had applied to join Minnikin’s party branch. The LNP executive intervened to prevent a preselection contest. While there is no suggestion the church leadership was involved in recruiting people to join the branch, Citipointe’s senior global pastors, Mark and Leigh Ramsey, have been vocal in their support for LNP politicians and attacks on Labor. On her social media accounts, Leigh Ramsey described the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, as “irrational” and “deplorable” and posted frequent criticisms of her in the months before the 2020 election. Ahead of the 2019 federal election, Mark Ramsey posted a portrait of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and said: “This election is not about what party you prefer, it’s about Good Godly Leadership.” Attempts to contact Mark and Leigh Ramsey were unsuccessful. Guardian Australia was told by the church they would not return calls and could not be emailed. Certainly some Citipointe leaders and members have clear links to the LNP. The chairperson of the Citipointe Christian College board, Graham Packer, is a significant fundraiser for the LNP. Packer, and two of his family leather companies, have donated $100,490 to the LNP in the past three years. He did not respond to questions. Brisbane’s lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, is a graduate of the college, and state opposition frontbencher and former deputy leader, Fiona Simpson, is a parishioner of an affiliated church. One of Citipointe’s youth pastors, Daniel Myhill, worked in the office of the federal MP Luke Howarth last year, and the former state MP for Capalaba, Steve Davies, is a Citipointe member. At the last state election, the LNP selected Citipointe pastor Janet Wishart to run in the local electorate of Mansfield. Her campaign posters were strung along the fence-line of the Citipointe campus and many of her volunteers were drawn from the church, including paid staff members. Wishart now works in the office of the leader of the opposition, David Crisafulli. Meanwhile, the Australian Christian Lobby – one of the bodies leading the push for the religious freedom bill – was birthed at Citipointe by a lay pastor, John Gagliardi, who once worked at the same church complex where school families were last week asked to sign enrolment contracts declaring homosexual acts were “immoral” and “offensive to God”. There is no suggestion Gagliardi was involved with the contracts. The Citipointe campus at Carindale is set out like its own private village. On-site is the massive church auditorium, with a coffee shop, information booth and an Eftpos machine for collecting payments and offerings. The complex also includes the school, with 1,700 students, a tertiary college, Christian Heritage, and a childcare centre. The church runs its own Hillsong-style music group, Citipointe Worship, and has established outposts in the US, New Zealand and Bulgaria. Its governing body, the Christian Outreach Centre (branded publicly as the International Network of Churches) reports about $54m in annual income and $250m in assets. The school has long had a positive reputation, one that many parents say was built by the former headmaster, Ron Woolley, who ran the college for more than 30 years and brought its teaching in line with the Queensland curriculum. Concerned parents and teachers say this week’s furore over enrolment contracts is simply emblematic of the shift towards a more literal religious doctrine that has taken place since Woolley retired in 2018 and Mulheran was brought in to run the school. Concerns include the way Mulheran sermonises to children, often speaking about homosexuality as “sin” and “going bright red when he does”. The principal has previously claimed he was “cured” of debilitating headaches by the prayer of a healing pastor. In a letter to the church community on Thursday, Mark Ramsey addressed the increasingly damaging media reports about the school. “Little did we realise that at the end of the first month of 2022 we as a church and school would be under the spotlight of government, media, the public and the communities in which we are located,” Ramsey wrote. “We believe that every person is made in the image of God, is equally loved by God and is of equal value. We know everyone matters to God, therefore, everyone matters to us. “I know some of you may have questions and maybe even feel disappointment in some aspects of this situation, and if you do, that’s ok.” Announcing the withdrawal of the school’s demand for parents to sign enrolment contracts, Mulherin this week offered an apology. “We deeply regret that some students feel that they would be discriminated against because of their sexuality or gender identity, and I apologise to them and their families on behalf of the college,” Mulheran said. “As stated previously, the college does not and will not discriminate against any student because of their sexuality or gender identity. It is central to our faith that being gay or transgender in no way diminishes a person’s humanity or dignity in God’s eyes.” But given the extent of Citipointe’s political involvement, some have wondered aloud whether the attempt to institute enrolment contracts was deliberately timed to coincide with the federal debate about religious freedoms. Teachers at the school say Mulheran was “acutely aware” of the political context, and he has been politically active on such matters in the past. In 1996 he lobbied the Senate to give employers “the right to discriminate”. “I have got a friend whose brother is a homosexual,” he said. “He does not feel harassed or anything by discussions that we have. (But) I do not accept his moral behaviour. “People who employ other people ... should have the right to discriminate.” Mulheran has also lobbied state MPs on discrimination laws and has previously been a state advisory board member of the rightwing Christian lobby group, FamilyVoice. The same group this week said criticism of Citipointe college showed “Australians are now in bondage to woke and LGBTIQA+ ideology”. The Queensland education minister, Grace Grace, who is also the parent of a non-binary child, earlier this week questioned the motivation of the school. Asked about the school’s LNP and political links, and the contracts being released while the religious freedom debate was happening, Grace said: “I certainly have suspicions about the timing. “Why is a new contract being put to parents at 5pm on a Friday when school resumes for some students on the Monday?” Grace said. “I sincerely hope this has nothing to do with chasing votes at the upcoming election. “I hate to think that vulnerable students could ever be used as part of a political stunt in that way.” If the contracts were connected to the religious freedom debate, they appear to have brought elements of that campaign to heel. Matilda Alexander, from the LGBTI legal service, said the contracts provided people with clear evidence what faith-based schools could attempt if certain elements of the laws were imposed; but that the backlash also showed community sentiment was firmly against those sorts of moves. Schrinner came out publicly and said he would not sign the contracts for his own children, who attend the school. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, also condemned the contracts and announced on Thursday the government would amend the religious freedom bill to explicitly prevent students being expelled for their sexuality or gender. The irony was not lost on those teachers at Citipointe who had been asked by Mulheran to pray for the legislation to remain intact. “Perhaps we should have prayed harder,” said one teacher. “Or then again, maybe some of us were praying for a different outcome.”",News/Australia news,‘Good Godly Leadership’: Citipointe Christian College’s extensive links to Queensland’s LNP,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/05/citipointe-christian-college-pastor-brian-mulheran-brisbane-school-lnp-liberal-national-party-queensland
2/5/2022,"New South Wales authorities have approved new fossil fuel projects expected to release at least 3bn tonnes of greenhouse gas – six times what Australia emits in a year – since the start of the landmark Paris agreement five years ago. The state’s Independent Planning Commission and its predecessor, the Planning Assessment Commission, have approved 23 coal and gas projects since the global climate deal formally came into force in November 2016, according to analysis by the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF).  That was also the month the NSW Coalition government promised to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Four coal developments – at Rocky Hill, Bylong and in the Illawarra and southern highlands – were rejected over that period. Another six major fossil fuel projects were awaiting a decision. They include Whitehaven’s proposed underground coalmine extension at Narrabri, which is the subject of public hearings this month. Based on documents submitted to the commission, ACF found emissions stemming from the approved projects – including those released on site (called scope one), from electricity used to run the operations (scope two) and the ultimate use of the coal and gas, often overseas (scope three) – would be about 3.2bn tonnes. That would reach 5bn tonnes if all currently proposed projects were approved. Annual emissions within Australia are about 500m tonnes. Using a carbon budget approach – which calculates the remaining emissions possible to give the planet a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – ACF found the approvals in NSW since 2020 were equivalent to 1% of the global total. Annica Schoo, the group’s lead investigator and a former federal government compliance and policy officer, said this was a conservative assessment as some companies did not fully disclose their expected lifetime emissions, and estimates of the true heating impact of methane – a more powerful heat-trapping gas than carbon dioxide – had increased in recent years. Schoo said the planning commission was not acting on its duty to make decisions that served the interest of the NSW people. Most of the projects would result in thermal coal being mined into the 2030s and 2040s. “I don’t think anyone who witnessed the bushfires a couple of years ago would say that more carbon in the atmosphere is good for NSW,” Schoo said. “While UN climate framework rules mean Australia is not held accountable for some of these emissions because most of the coal and gas from these projects is burned elsewhere, Australia has a moral responsibility not to keep pushing climate-wrecking fuel on the world.” The NSW government referred questions to the planning and environment department. A department spokesperson said NSW was “one of the first places anywhere in the world” to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, and government modelling showed its renewable energy, electric vehicle and hydrogen policies were expected to trigger a 50% cut in state carbon pollution by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. “This places NSW as one of the top jurisdictions anywhere on the planet when it comes to emissions reduction commitments,” they said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Schoo said a decision last year by the federal court that found the commonwealth environment minister had a duty of care to protect children from the climate crisis when exercising approval powers should be seen as a precedent for the state planning commission and other government decision makers. The NSW approvals are consistent with other decisions to continue to approve and support fossil fuel projects across the country, although the federal government and both Coalition and Labor state governments have promised to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. Western Australia supports significant gas developments off the state’s north-west, and Queensland backs coal developments including in the Galilee basin, the site of Adani’s Carmichael mine. Both have been supported by the federal government. The Morrison government’s position on fossil fuels is that cost and global markets will dictate the pace of the shift to cleaner technology. It has approved the expansion of four coalmines since September and in July granted a $175m loan for a new metallurgical coalmine in Queensland. On gas, it has said it hoped to develop four more basins after Beetaloo.

An analysis found they could result in nearly 1.7bn tonnes of greenhouse gases a year, equivalent to about 5% of global industrial emissions, if all went ahead. A new analysis by the Australia Institute found the federal government had committed $749m to programs that supported fossil fuel industries since it set a national net zero emissions target for 2050 in October. Most of that money – $500m – was dedicated to a $1bn low emissions technology commercialisation fund and to supporting “clean” hydrogen, which includes hydrogen made from gas and coal as well as renewable energy. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said the key issue was that government was yet to introduce a promised hydrogen certification scheme that would show what type of fuel was used to produce it. Until that was in place, the extent to which support for hydrogen would be encouraging fossil fuels rather than renewable energy remained unclear, he said.",News/Australia news,NSW fossil fuel projects approved since Paris agreement set to release 3bn tonnes of emissions,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/05/nsw-fossil-fuel-projects-approved-since-paris-agreement-set-to-release-3bn-tonnes-of-emissions
2/5/2022,"Criticism is as inevitable as breathing, or so TS Eliot would have us believe. But the debate over whether criticism is applied fairly to women in sport continues to do the rounds, questioning why our female athletes are not criticised for their mistakes in the same way their male counterparts are. The problem is of course that this question springs from an assumption that we have equality in sport in the first place. That it is only a lack of fair criticism holding women’s sport back from achieving its peak. With the rise of women’s sport over the past five years, you don’t have to look very hard to see female athletes described as “golden girls”, role models or being compared favourably to male athletes for their behaviour and composure. The likes of Ash Barty, Ellyse Perry and Liz Watson are often given as examples of how an athlete can be talented and successful as well as gracious and humble.  While that may seem complimentary to these women, it only adds to the messaging of what is acceptable for girls and women. It conjures the image of a primary school teacher admonishing the boys for misbehaving and praising the quiet and obedient girls. It tells girls and women that you must be subservient to succeed, but even then you won’t get the same opportunities as your free-spirited male equivalents who are rewarded for their misdemeanours with more media coverage and higher pay. The other problem arises when our “golden girls” fail. When Barty exits a tournament in its early stages or Perry drops an easy catch in the outfield, the instinct is to preserve their reputation, to avoid criticism lest we recognise that these athletes we have put on a pedestal are in fact only human. For those who have followed and nurtured women’s sport for years, there is a strong desire to move on from this limited view and embrace the humanity of female athletes, but we are wary of outsiders who stalk in and demand the right to criticise. As much as we want the sports to be taken seriously, every potential piece of criticism sparks the memories of comments on our stories telling us that no one cares about these sports that we have poured our hearts and souls into. We are protective of the athletes because we have followed their careers, we understand their sacrifices and don’t want to throw them to the wolves who want the right to belittle their skills and pass judgement on their appearance. If Pat Cummins bungles his field placings or declares too late to ensure a result, people can speak their mind and point out his mistakes without critics emerging to suggest that men probably aren’t suited to Test cricket. If Tom Rogic misses an open goal, that can be discussed without anyone saying that he’s ugly and suggesting he should get back to the kitchen. Male athletes can make mistakes that represent only an individual failing. When female athletes make mistakes, bad faith critics hold them up as an example of their gender, a reason why women don’t belong in the cutthroat world of sport. Criticism is good and healthy, but criticism of women’s sport is so often rooted in misogyny that there is an understandable fear of opening the sports up to too much of it. The balance is hard to strike, but if you look beyond the back pages of the mainstream newspapers there is nuanced and contextual criticism to be found. Analysis from critics who understand that while male cricket captains have 10 Tests a year to hone their decision making, women are lucky to have one. Who know that an AFLW season is made up of shortened games, no full home-and-away season and played in the height of summer by athletes who fit full time jobs around their football. Who can see the lack of scrutiny applied to the often all-male coaching and selection teams whose decisions have as big an impact on the situation on the field as the mistakes that the players make. So how do we solve the problem and allow for more constructive criticism of women’s sport? The answer is simply more coverage from more diverse voices. When women’s sport takes up the same amount of space in newspapers, websites and TV news bulletins as men’s sport, there will not be the option to fall back on stereotypes because there is space that needs to be filled, which means more than one story needs to be told. When the people who cover the sports in the mainstream media have the appropriate context and understanding of the sports they are following that space will be filled with legitimate analysis. As is the case with almost every perceived problem that can be found in women’s sport, the first step is to level the playing field. There is no quick fix, the only solution is equality.",Sport/Sport,Criticism of women’s sport is healthy but the right balance can be hard to strike | Megan Maurice,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/05/criticism-of-womens-sport-is-healthy-but-the-right-balance-can-be-hard-to-strike
2/5/2022,"Draped over an armchair lies a woman in a puffy yellow frock. Head hanging and face shielded by forlorn, folded arms, she is a pastel portrait of misery. After all, she is on the Australian cover of Meg Mason’s 2020 novel Sorrow and Bliss. Mason’s book was a huge hit around the world. Now, a catalogue of well-dressed and apparently distressed, faceless women are appearing on covers. Among them is Genevieve Novak’s debut No Hard Feelings, to be published in Australia in March this year. The cover features a woman flopped atop a bed, legs bent and arms sprawled to hide her face. The title is large, and followed by a teaser: “Hungover, underpaid and overwhelmed.”  Similarly, Kimberley Allsopp’s upcoming release, Love and Other Puzzles, with its synopsis “life doesn’t always go according to plan”, has a woman in a bright yellow coat, leaning head-down and fed-up against a pink wall. She Is Haunted by Paige Clark, a debut short story collection published last year, features the same bold title font and a woman staring out a window. And then there’s Careering by Daisy Buchanan, which is out in March this year. Among greens and watermelon reds, and another sad synopsis (“On the right track … or coming off the rails?”), a woman in pink skirts lies face-down on a couch. While an obvious trend is emerging, the primary inspiration for a design for any book cover “is always the text itself”, says Mietta Yans, vice-president of the Australian Book Designers Association, and designer of Novak’s cover. “And all of these books coming through are about distressed women in their 20s, reflecting on the chaos of life at that point. Maybe it is a result of the pandemic, but I fully relate to these books,” she laughs. “I feel it makes it easier for me to design them.” “You know it is a trend,” Mark Campbell, head of HarperCollins’ design department, says. “Especially when separate designers from separate publishing houses are coming to the same place by themselves.” Campbell says “a saturation of illustrated covers” followed the publication of Sally Rooney’s Normal People back in 2018. The novel featured a large bold title and minimalistic line art of lovers embracing in a tin, against a muted olive backdrop. Campbell calls it a “sad, lonely illustration style. A person frustrated with the world. It hit a nerve.” With Normal People becoming a huge hit and landing plenty of awards, “publishers wanted to follow its success – designers go, ‘this book is similar, so let’s make it look similar too’,” he says. James Ross, operations manager at Gleebooks, says he has been seeing “variations on Sally Rooney covers” coming through his bookshop – like Diana Reed’s Love and Virtue, Holly Wainwright’s I Give My Marriage a Year, and the international cover of Mason’s Sorrow and Bliss. They tend to appeal to “anyone who is a fan of the greats, like your Didions” as well as “a younger audience with geometric shapes and colours”. “Bold colour pallets, type-led, graphic and visual” are all design choices made to “romanticise the ideas and experiences in the book”, says Yans. Choosing a faceless woman over a portrait “adds an anonymity that lets the reader imagine the story as their own”. But “at the back of every trend, there is something emerging that is the opposite, or pushes it further,” she says. “As a designer, you are looking for something that will reach the same mass audience … but in a different way, setting the story apart.” “Illustrated covers had their moment,” says Campbell. Post-Rooney, cover designers are opting for photographs instead to invoke “a similar feeling and message of that loneliness or frustration”. He recalls the 2020 novel Kokomo by Victoria Hannan as one of the first to branch out from the “illustrated uncomfortable person to the photographic version of the same thing”. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The early seeds of this trend, he thinks, came with the 2018 reissue of Rachel Cusk’s Outline books. There are no distressed women in sight – just arty, Polaroid-style images, framed by a thick white border and grounded by bold type. But put them next to titles like Sorrow and Bliss and No Hard Feelings, and “you start to see trends blend together”, he says. “You would see literary covers with arty images, and then commercial covers with big text and illustrated characters. Every publisher wants their book to fall in the sweet spot, and the photographic covers feel halfway in between this,” he says. In his bookshop, Ross has noticed that covers trends “tend to shift with one groundbreaking, or an indefinable book”. “It takes a book that is not similar to the stuff that you have been seeing before,” he observes. “A challenging, intriguing text usually has a cover that is also challenging, intriguing and fresh.” And just like any trend, all these sad young women will disappear from covers soon. “Eventually, too many things look the same,” Campbell says. “Then a writer will come along and demand a cover that is different. They make us ask, how do we reinvent the wheel? How can we move the dial forward? How do we find the sweet spot in that genre without trying to look the same?” But it may not be this year, and we may see even more before the trend disappears entirely, says Yans, who anticipates seeing more of the same “type, colour and design-led things” in 2022. “It is what the audience wants to see,” she says. “And the more it works in commercial, the more publishers start to trust designers.”",Arts/Books,Well-dressed and distressed: why sad young women are the latest book cover trend,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/05/well-dressed-and-distressed-why-sad-young-women-are-the-latest-book-cover-trend
2/5/2022,"ANazi flag hangs on one side of the hall, the Australian flag on the other. Between them, a floral arrangement lines the steps leading to a framed portrait of Adolf Hitler above which a sign in German says “50 years”. Who took the photograph inside a German club in Adelaide on 20 April 1939 is not known but more than 80 years later the image of the decorations laid out to mark Adolf Hitler’s 50th birthday is a reminder of an episode in Australia’s history now barely remembered.  Many of the details have been lost: how many people attended, who they were and what speeches they gave at the podium draped in a swastika. What is known is that the decorations were overseen by Ilma Bohlmann (née Menzel), an Australian citizen and Nazi sympathiser, who during the war denounced members of the German community for their disloyalty to Hitler’s dictatorship. The photo is not the only record of Nazi activity in Australia in the years before the second world war, when a small but determined network sought to expand the party’s influence among German migrants and others across the country. Others that survive show a cheerful group on the steps of the Carrington Hotel in the Blue Mountains town of Katoomba, and a solemn scene at a German memorial for first world war victims in Sydney’s Rookwood cemetery. The historian Barbara Poniewierskihas mapped out the activities of these groups and built a list of every known Nazi party member in Australia that included their membership number – an important piece of evidence to challenge any later claims that they had no involvement. “Nothing happened to them after the war,” she says. “They went back to their farms, back to their work. Thought they got away with it. Which they did, I suppose. “But they left a legacy of shame that reflects on the rest of the German community [in South Australia]. Unfairly, because most of them were loyal.” Today the Barossa in SA is known for shiraz and picturesque views, but more than half a century ago the close-knit German community of Tanunda served as the launching point for the Nazi party’s effort to expand in Australia. This work was organised Dr Johannes Heinrich Becker, a first world war veteran who arrived in Australia in 1927. Becker joined the party on 1 March 1932, about a year after he was asked by a member of the Reichstag to set up local branches in Australia. From Tanunda, Becker coordinated with his counterpart in Sydney, Johannes Frerck, the owner of a continental deli in Darlinghurst. Frerck and his wife, Elsa Bachman, had joined the party together in 1925, only a few years after its formation. His membership number was 9,028 and hers 9,029. As membership was reserved for German citizens, and the party leadership was hesitant to admit those living overseas, the earlier a person joined the more trusted they would be. Though his membership lapsed – either for financial reasons or because of a personal grudge – Frerck’s status as one of the first 10,000 meant he was considered an “old fighter”, earning him clout. Together Frerck and Becker began to recruit, setting up branches in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, and quickly planning a takeover of the German clubs in each major city. Two German clubs operated in SA, one for working-class members whose politics leaned socialist and one on Adelaide’s Pirie Street, whose members typically belonged to the upper middle class. The Pirie Street club was targeted for takeover and, though an attempt was made to resist, it became a focal point for Nazi organising in the state. With only 12 members each, the two Nazi party branches in SA were smaller than their Sydney and Melbourne counterparts but potentially more influential, thanks to the large German community in and around Adelaide. Another organisation was created for Australian citizens who could not join the party, initially called the Friends of the Hitler Movement but later tactfully renamed the Club for Further Education. Becker is believed to have taken the group photo with the earliest members of the Adelaide Nazi party branch in front of a vineyard along Gomersal Road in Tanunda in about 1934. Those present include Pinaroo storekeeper Carl Christoph Fienemann, Ernst Emil Starke, Karl Johan Rohde (a visiting member of the Brisbane branch), stonemason Heinrich Wallenstein, Wilhelm Friedrich Abel, Walter Ernst Bartsch, Harry Hahn and Oluf Bohlens. The photo was later be passed to Australian intelligence, and those who had not returned to Germany were interned during the war. As national branch leader for the Australian party, Becker was also made the head of the Gestapo in Australia. Though he did not have the powers of a police officer, the position meant that even the German consul general, Rudolf Asmis, had to consult with him on certain issues. The Gestapo in Australia operated under the innocuous name of the Harbour Service and their official role was to entertain German sailors in port. In fact they were watching visiting Germans, running background checks on those applying for visas to return home and reporting on German-Jewish refugees. There is at least one recorded instance of a sailor who complained about the dictatorship while visiting his brother in Tanunda being arrested on his return to Germany. The power quickly went to Becker’s head and a feud with Asmis eventually erupted into public abuse. Asmis thought Becker mentally ill and a tyrant; Becker considered Asmis low class and a careerist of questionable loyalty. The clash ended when Asmis had Becker removed from his post. By 1938 the organisation had been restructured, with some branches dissolved. In 1939, after an SS officer, Alfred Henschel, took charge of the Australian Nazi party, records obtained by Australian intelligence services show there were 177 paying members across the country, including 33 women. The list was found by new tenants under the kitchen lino of a Sydney flat that once belonged to the party’s treasurer, who had hidden it there before being interned. Coverage of the Nazis by the Australian press generally focused on what was happening in Germany rather than locally, and ranged widely in tone, sliding into outright propaganda at times. A 1934 article in the Adelaide evening paper the News headlined “Hitler does not want warfare”, maintained that “Hitler has the whole of Germany on his side in as far as he was able to free the German people from the intellectual domination of the Jew”. As war became certain the mood changed decisively and sympathisers in Australia came under more scrutiny, culminating in glowing coverage of police raids on party members across Australia, who were described in the Sydney Sun as “Goebbels’ agents”. From 1933 the Australian government made efforts to keep an eye on the Nazis, dispatching two spies to monitor the community in Tanunda. The first was Sergeant Otto Bieri, a Swiss who had previously reported on Nazi activity in New Guinea. After an “indiscretion” exposed his work, he was replaced by a pastor, Luis Alfred Tepper. Working under the codename “A4”, Tepper and his family became accepted as Nazi sympathisers and he generated detailed reports about covert activities during the war, though it came at a personal cost – his son was taught to heil Hitler and draw swastikas. He wrote with sympathy about the town’s only Jewish resident, who did not know what was said about him in private, and how Lutheran pastors, particularly those involved with the United Evangelical Lutheran church, were Nazi sympathisers. “What impressed me was he was so outraged and heartbroken at what he found in Tanunda,” Poniewierski says. “He was Australian-born, but of German descent. And he couldn’t believe there was so much treachery there.” As the war drew to a close Tepper, who died a “retired school teacher” in 2006, could foresee how the story would end. In his reports he wrote how outspoken Nazis and their supporters would “crawl and cringe to the world pleading their innocence and saying they never harboured any sentiments of disloyalty”. “These people at and around Tanunda will get away with the whole rotten show,” he said. Tepper’s prediction was accurate. After the war an inquiry was held to determine what should happen to party supporters who had been interned, with the Argus in Melbourne reporting a judge’s view that Friederich Wilhelm Heim was “as Nazi as ever”. Some ended up like Becker, who was deported in 1947 and died in Germany in 1961. Others who had been Nazi sympathisers, but not necessarily party members, simply faded back into the community. In one instance, a man who had threatened to shoot his sons if they enlisted to fight against Germany began using their service on behalf of the Allies to demonstrate his Australian patriotism. Much later an effort would be made to rewrite history and claim Germans had faced persecution, although just 21 native-born Germans in SA were interned at the start of the war – a fraction of the 20,000 living in the state. The journalist Mark Aarons, author of War Criminals Welcome, says the story continued along familiar lines in the decades after the war. Some German Nazis and collaborators from eastern Europe found a new home in Australia, and Aarons says he confirmed a group of ex-SS officers set up a clandestine organisation in SA to keep their ideology alive. Aarons says successive Australian governments sought to avoid asking too many questions about the past, as many former Nazis and their collaborators went on to be recruited by intelligence services during the cold war, or became involved in politics. “As far as I’m concerned, the cover-up continued until the 1990s,” Aarons says. “It all goes back to that extraordinary photo from 1939, which really illustrates how Australian politics didn’t care about the Nazis. “A gathering of Nazis in 1939, celebrating Hitler’s birthday, was not an exceptional thing at all.”",News/Australia news,"Happy birthday, Hitler: how Australia’s Nazis got away with ‘the whole rotten show’",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/05/happy-birthday-hitler-how-australias-nazis-got-away-with-the-whole-rotten-show
2/5/2022,"Stewart Hayter is at his wits’ end. You can hear it in his voice, which breaks with emotion as he recalls the two years he’s spent separated from his UK-based daughter Charley, his severely autistic grandson Tyler, eight, and his granddaughter Annabella, seven, who also lives with autism.  Where so many other families were given a reprieve from border restrictions allowing them to reunite before Christmas, Hayter’s nightmare has continued in a farcical fashion. In October, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced he was opening the international border to immediate family members of Australians and permanent residents, so long as they were vaccinated. But the rules create a bizarre situation. Currently, adult children of Australian residents are not considered immediate family, but the parents of Australian residents are. That means Hayter’s daughter is not allowed to travel to Australia without an exemption. Neither are her two children or her husband. “I can cope with anything, you can throw me any situation and I’ll deal with it,” he said. “But this is beyond me, and that’s not something I say easily. So if it’s having this effect on me, how does it affect eight-year-old little Tyler?” The confusion was so significant that Hayter booked $7,000 worth of tickets for his family to fly to Australia in March which now cannot be used. He’s since watched on as Morrison opened up the country to working backpackers and students – telling them to “come on down”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It’s just a slap in the face. It says we don’t give a stuff about your emotional health,” he said. “I’ll put it this way, I’m on my last reserves of emotional strength, and I have just enough to get to March. And I’m alone. I’m not lonely – I’ve got mates, good mates. I’m not lonely, I’m alone.” The current rules confine an “immediate family” member to someone’s spouse, de facto partner, dependent child, or the parent of a dependent child. It is unclear why the federal government is maintaining its limited definition of immediate family, given the widespread nature of Omicron, and the fact the border has been opened to virtually every category of temporary visaholders with imminent plans to open to tourists. Questions to the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, were referred to the home affairs department, which repeated earlier statements about the need to protect Australia from Covid-19. “Parents of adult Australian citizens and permanent residents, spouses, de facto partners, dependent children and legal guardians are all considered to be immediate family members for the purpose of exemptions to Australia’s travel restrictions,” a spokesperson said. “This ensures a path for Australians to travel to overseas and be reunited with friends and family, until Australia’s restrictions are eased to allow further exemption-free international travel.” Tyler and Annabella’s support workers in the UK wrote a supporting statement saying the trip to Australia would be crucial, not only for the grandchildren, who are extremely close to their grandfather, but also for their parents, who were in need of respite. The supporting statement has done nothing to change the government’s position. Hayter has been told he must have his daughter, her husband and grandchildren apply for visas and then apply for travel exemptions. He has attempted to apply for visas for them and been told they are not eligible. Travel exemptions are also rarely being granted. For holders of bridging visas, another group still facing a closed international border, roughly 70% of exemption requests are being denied. A petition by people like Hayer was presented to parliament prior to Christmas, signed by more than 1,200 people in a similar situation. “Covid has created a cruel divide for many families and it has caused further separation in that immediate family members have not been considered as such and have been unable to connect,” it said. “Australia’s population is multicultural and for all to thrive, immediate family members need to be recognised as such.”",News/Australia news,‘I’m alone’: grandfather says to still deny adult children entry to Australia is ‘a slap in the face’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/05/im-alone-grandfather-says-to-still-deny-adult-children-entry-to-australia-is-a-slap-in-the-face
2/5/2022,"An abandoned sound system left outside a club. A giant paper elephant 2m long and 1m high. A group of puppets, waiting to be liberated. Annual kerbside cleanup days are, for some, akin to Christmas – a holy time for up-cyclers and “waste warriors” to forage the streets for a speck of gold.  But wastage concerns are seeing councils increasingly moving away from annual collections to online booking services of varying quantities, making it harder for scavengers to bring home a haul. The vast majority of council collections are unable to be reused once disposed, and end up being crushed for landfill. Australians are among the largest per capita waste producers in the globe, trailing behind only the US and Canada. In 2020-21, Melbourne’s Yarra city council collected 2,946 tonnes of hard rubbish – of which more than 2,000 tonnes weren’t able to be repaired or recycled. The council now offers two hard waste pick-ups a year but encourages residents to “reduce before you book” and re-home or donate unwanted items before leaving them on the street. In the City of Port Phillip – south of the Melbourne CBD – residents are entitled to between four and six hard and green waste collections a year. Mayor Marcus Pear says the council has undertaken an on-demand hard rubbish collection for the past 15 years. “It allows us to better respond to the individual needs of our community,” he says. The City of Sydney provides a free weekly service for bulky waste, mattresses and green waste including “real or plastic Christmas trees”, currently delayed due to Covid-19, while Sydney’s Inner West council is working towards zero waste targets by redirecting resources away from landfill through “needs based” collections online. About 82% of household items and furniture it collects ends up in landfill. While most councils are careful to discourage the practice of hard rubbish on environmental and wastage grounds, others threaten fines for scavenging on the street. Darebin city council – in Melbourne’s inner north – runs two seasonal hard rubbish collections in spring and winter, but threatens a $300 fine for anyone picking up items. In the City of Port Phillip, the figure is $660, with a recycling recovery rate of 60 to 70% due to separate pre-sorting collections of hard and green waste. But the practice of street scavenging also runs by unwritten rules. Once on the nature strip – fair game. But if it’s in the bin? Leave it. Street bounty groups that pop up on social media are one way waste warriors and diehard collectors have overcome the move from annual hard rubbish days. Annie Lenne is one of the thousands of members of Darebin Hard Rubbish Heroes, a Facebook group that promotes the concept of recycle and reuse by keeping preloved items out of landfill. Lenne’s latest find was a bag of discarded hardcover art books. “I love seeing stuff on the side of the road and being like – ‘oh my God, who’s getting rid of this? This is perfect’,” she says. Lenne frequents op shops, but finds something special in “saving trash and giving it a whole new life”. “Sometimes it’s fully functioning and working, and some of the time it needs a bit of work or TLC,” she says. “I’ve upcycled big furniture pieces – an armchair picked up off the road, a hallway table that just needed a light sanding, refinishing and screwing the legs back on.” Apart from chance encounters and social media posts, Lenne follows council pickup times and, when a hard rubbish date is set, goes on day trips with her housemates. “I don’t understand why it’s illegal to pick up from other people’s piles,” she says. “What’s the harm? You’re saving things from ending up in the trash, and I find it’s such an achievement. While leaving junk on the curb without a hard rubbish booking is illegal, councils decide individually whether, once disposed of, items are fair game for salvaging. Many don’t actively ban it, but encourage residents to recycle or re-home before placing items on the street. Others have local laws prohibiting the practice, and threaten fines of a few hundred up to several thousands dollars related for scavenging on safety grounds. But the fines are rarely issued, and rely on residents self reporting culprits. “Sometimes you’re walking down the street and it’s exactly the thing you need … it appears just like fate.” Lenne is finishing a furniture course and is used to repurposing items into something new, but wants hard rubbish collecting to be more widely accepted. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “People don’t know how to dispose of things, and a lot of the time it can be confusing and hard to find the right information,” she says. Chris Anders has perfected the art of salvaging since he used to set up empty wool packs in frames in the Wimmera, for locals to fill with aluminium cans and plastic bottles. Working as a scrap dealer, he’d then sell the cans and transport the five cent deposit containers to the South Australian border. Anders now runs an antique store in regional Victoria and runs his own YouTube Channel – ‘the Ultimate Recycler’. He hasn’t done a load of general rubbish to the tip in 15 years. “I’ve always liked fixing rather than throwing out,” he says. “I got involved in recycling before people even had recycling bins”. Anders says his love of hard rubbish was hardwired in him by his parents, who grew up in the Great Depression and used to wash plastic bags and dry them over a wood stove to reuse them. “That’s the culture they grew up in – waste not, want not,” he says. “You can discover things you never would have before.”",News/Australia news,Australia’s hard rubbish heroes risk council fines to recycle and re-home their kerbside plunder,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/05/australias-hard-rubbish-heroes-risk-council-fines-to-recycle-and-re-home-their-kerbside-plunder
2/5/2022,"Residents of the inner municipalities of Melbourne, Yarra and Port Phillip woke this week to bands of flame orange and fluoro green e-scooters adorning local street corners, tram stops and back roads – like small armies of benevolent Daleks. As part of a 12-month trial, 1,500 rentable Lime and Neuron e-scooters have been placed around the three LGAS. They have a maximum speed limit of 20km/h, and their usage will be restricted to bike lanes, shared paths and low-speed roads.  Melburnians could be forgiven for having a rather sceptical view on the viability of shared micro-mobility programs, since, as Dr Elliot Fishman, director of the Institute for Sensible Transport, put it: “Melbourne doesn’t have a particularly successful history of running these schemes.” Those past failures, include the “blue-bikes” scheme that ran from 2010 to 2019 before being pulled off the roads due to poor uptake – at a cost of around $2m per year in public subsidies – and the disastrous O-bike scheme. The bright yellow bikes that were famously, frequently thrown into the Yarra River or hoisted up trees, before the company leasing them eventually went bankrupt. The Port Phillip mayor Marcus Pearl says the council has “learnt a lot from the O-bike experience”. He cites the guidelines set out for current e-bike schemes, including no-ride, no-parking and slow zones, and says “while we cannot control the behaviour of individuals, the strict guidelines … have proven effective during this ongoing trial”. “Similar principles for the management of shared e-scooters have been included in the agreement with shared e-scooter operators,” he says. And, “as with the shared e-bikes, the operators will be responsible for all costs associated with e-scooter recovery from parks and waterways”. E-scooters come with their own baggage too. In Canberra and Brisbane, they have been met with vociferous opposition and, in Hobart, two city councillors have called for a suspension of the city’s current e-scooter trial amid safety concerns. Internationally, safety issues have also come to the fore. In Paris the use of e-scooters was restricted after a fatal incident involving a pedestrian in June 2021. London has also recently banned them from being brought on to public transport after a spate of battery fires led to vehicles combusting. Still, as an e-scooter virgin, I was keen to give them a spin. After scanning the QR code through the Neuron smartphone app, a mellifluous female voice instructs me to “test the brakes” and provides a gentle reminder that “riding isn’t permitted on footpaths” followed by a cheery bell sound. I removed the helmet from its clip-in holster and hit the road. As an avid e-bike rider, the first thing I noticed is that these scooters feel relatively slow and stable to ride, and much heavier than I’d imagined. They are completely GPS-operated, meaning the scooters slow down in slow traffic zones, and simply power off when ridden into no-riding zones such as heavily pedestrianised malls. But after spending a few days scooting around the quiet tree-lined backstreets and beachside bike paths of St Kilda, I realised there is something liberating about being able to simply step on to an e-scooter and ride for as long (or short) a distance as I required. It feels like the start of a tiny-wheeled transport revolution. One of the positives about the rental scheme is the cost – 45c a minute with a $1 activation fee makes them pretty accessible for short trips. I rode from my home to the beach, a journey that would take about 15 minutes to walk, in about five minutes – costing a grand total of $3.25. Learning the ropes of riding was a matter of trial and error – for example, you have to park them in designated parking areas, which means checking the map before you head off, so you know where to end the trip. This also means they won’t be as likely to end up blocking pavements which has been a problem, particularly for people with mobility issues, in other cities. If you’re like me, you will probably ride into no-ride zones once, and learn to avoid them on future rides. A more serious current restriction is that the devices are a nodal transport system – meaning they will only operate within particular areas. At present it isn’t possible to ride from St Kilda to Chapel Street, for instance, because the adjoining municipality of Stonnington isn’t part of the trial. This worries Fishman, who says “one of the things that will end up minimising the success of these schemes is the lack of connected bike infrastructure and lack of connected slow streets.” “In a city of five million people, in Melbourne we still don’t really have enough of those to make this a solution that most people would consider for themselves.” But he does see promise. “It is part of a transition that a lot of global cities are going through to try to reduce the impact of people’s mobility on things like emissions, road safety and congestion.” Locally, opinions are divided about the arrival of the e-scooters. When I canvassed opinions on a St Kilda residents group, some people immediately branded them a “menace”. One local resident, Tamahine Willenberg, commented that “the trial allowing them on shared paths is a disaster waiting to happen … 20kph is just too fast for shared path”. However, other locals were supportive. St Kilda resident Paul Jonathan said: “The more people we can get out of cars, the safer our roads are. We also urgently need to reduce transport emissions due to the climate emergency.” According to Dr Alexa Delbosc, a senior lecturer in transport engineering at Monash University, that’s the key benefit of e-scooters: they provide a genuine alternative to help people travel without cars in congested urban areas. “The challenges around safety and suitability are the same that cyclists face every day. But if programs like this make more people interested in scooting, it provides even more reason to roll out safe infrastructure for people on bikes or on scooters,” she says. Fishman agrees. He says the trial’s success or failure will come down to its scale and cost. “I think the expansion … to cover the whole city area is the thing that is going to make it work,” he says. “At the moment it is quite restricted. It is also crucial that the pricing of these schemes is such that it allows people to use them as a regular means of transport rather than just a one-off.” Ultimately, Fishman says, e-scooters are taking up public space, “so they need to provide a public good”.",News/Australia news,Liberating but limited: road testing Melbourne’s new e-scooter rental scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/05/liberating-but-limited-road-testing-melbournes-new-e-scooter-rental-scheme
2/5/2022,"Rose learned there was an outbreak in her aged care home in New South Wales when “an enormous man” she had never seen before stood over her bed and woke her up at midnight. “He was all dressed in PPE and said, ‘you have to have a rapid antigen test [RAT] – we’ve got a case of Covid in the home’,” the 81-year-old says.  “It was quite a shock. When he left I pulled the sheet over my head. I could hear other residents crying because they would have been very frightened to have been woken like that. It wasn’t very well handled. I think the staff panicked.” Since the highly infectious Omicron strain of Covid-19 emerged in Australia in late November, the virus has spread through aged care like wildfire. In January, 499 aged care residents died with Covid-19, more than the total number who died in Australia in 2021. Most deaths were in New South Wales. In February so far another 34 aged care deaths have been reported, bringing the total in 2022 to 533. There were 625 aged care deaths in the whole of 2020. Currently, 1,176 aged care facilities are battling an active outbreak. Most are in NSW (525 homes), followed by Victoria (275), Queensland (202) and South Australia (137). Across the country, 11,980 aged care residents and staff had an active case on 4 February. Two years into the pandemic many residents and staff at affected homes report dangerous staff shortages, with cleaners and lifestyle workers being called on to handle personal care and food preparation roles outside their skillset. On Friday, the defence minister, Peter Dutton, raised the prospect of troops being sent in. Residents and staff in different locations have told Guardian Australia that when an outbreak occurs, many homes panic and seem unsure of their own plans. Some residents are immediately locked down, meaning they are unable to see family and friends for weeks. Different homes have had different policies on visits throughout the Omicron wave, even when there is no active outbreak. The home where Rose lives was in lockdown from mid-January to early February. She was not allowed outside for fresh air but was permitted to go to the cafe under supervision for one hour in the mornings to read the sport news from the paper for a friend and fellow resident who is blind. “My granddaughter wanted to come to the glass front door and just wave to me,” Rose says. “That wasn’t permitted sadly. And so all I can say is thank goodness for the internet. But not all residents can use the internet and [they] are just sitting in their rooms watching television 24/7. I think the lack of communication would be most sorely felt by them.” Rose makes it clear she does not blame staff for the way the outbreak was handled and that they showed care and compassion – but she is baffled by the lack of government support for them. “A lot of staff have been off sick of course, and the outside staff [such as gardeners and maintenance staff] have been filling in doing a magnificent job, not with personal care, but with delivering meals and helping with the laundry, all that sort of thing. But I think the government’s been really lacking, and a lot more could have been done sooner. I think the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, is an absolute disgrace. I mean going to the cricket … what are his priorities, really? Does he know what’s going on?” The nursing manager of the home where Rose lives says she based her outbreak management plan on the federal government’s Covid support plan for aged care, which promised a surge workforce in times of outbreak. But when the home experienced its outbreak and she desperately needed extra staff, “there was no surge workforce,” she said. “I didn’t get a single additional staff member.” Now that the outbreak is over, the PPE supplied by the federal government has started to arrive. The home managed only because the nursing manager “hoarded and locked up PPE I found myself for the past two years in preparation for this”, she says. “I wasn’t going to rely on the government to supply it,” she says. “No way. Now it’s arriving of course, and I have 20,000 gowns I don’t know what to do with. But we may have another outbreak, so I will keep them.” The nursing manager says the outbreak began when three staff members working in the same section of the home tested positive within 32 hours, so she made the call to send staff in that same night to test those residents at the highest risk of being exposed. She says she believes residents were woken up closer to 10pm than midnight. “But it wasn’t ideal,” she says. “However, I made that call because I didn’t want any staff going in to help a resident throughout the night and then spreading it. It was also the advice the public health unit gave me. “I am close to retirement and I have managed hospitals, worked in intensive care and acute care … and I have never felt pressure like this. I am proud that where I work now, I have had one of the highest retention rates of my staff in the industry. But not now – not since Omicron hit. The reality is, this government has made a huge amount of mistakes. My staff should not be on the pittance they are being paid. I don’t think anyone in aged care is OK.” According to the public health researcher and director of Aged Care Matters, Dr Sarah Russell, the federal government has a “hands-off approach”, treating each aged care home as an individual business. “As a result, many federal aged care homes are a law unto themselves,” she says. There are inconsistent and sometimes inhumane policies around visits, Russell says, as well as different policies on staff ratios. In state-run care homes the rules are different again. Victorian-owned public aged care homes, for example, operate under the Safe Patient Care Act, which prescribes ratios of registered nurses. “On the morning shift, one registered nurse is required for every seven residents; in the afternoon, one registered nurse for every eight residents; and on the night shift, one registered nurse for every 15 residents,” Russell says. “Compare this with staffing in privately-owned residential aged care homes, where a single registered nurse is often required to look after more than 100 residents. Not surprisingly, deaths in aged care homes during the current outbreak in Victoria are almost exclusively a private sector aged-care issue. And all residents in Victoria-owned aged care homes were offered a booster before Christmas.” Of the 46 aged care deaths in Victoria during the Omicron outbreak to 31 January, just four were in state-run care homes. Jess, who works in a private aged care home in Sydney, says the facility “makes up their own rules”. A lifestyle worker, her role is to facilitate outings and activities for the residents. Instead, with Omicron spreading through the home, she has found herself working as a personal care worker, bathing residents and feeding them. “I showed up to one shift and there was just one carer per 45 residents and they only managed to find one relief staff member,” she says. “It was awful. The manager told me I had to work the floor doing caring and feeding, even though I’ve never been trained in all the things that carers are taught how to do. Then the residents are just asking us constantly, ‘When can I go out?’, ‘When can I leave my room?’, ‘When can I see my family?’. They are just devastated.” Jess says she has seen people still in bed at 1pm because they need two staff members to help them out or into a wheelchair – but there are no staff free. “I feel helpless because I can’t lift them and haven’t been trained to use a hoist,” Jess says. “In the last three weeks especially, they’re yelling out for help. I have noticed their buzzers to call for assistance are being turned off by the staff, or moved just out of reach for them. “Everyone’s just calling and calling for the nurse but if they’ve got two nurses it’s just physically impossible for everyone to be seen. But I have plugged a few buzzers back in or moved their bedpan close enough to reach. “One of the worst situations I saw was a lady with quite severe dementia, and she was sitting in her own poo and urine. I went and tried to get the nurse but there were only two nurses on that day, and they needed two people to use the hoist machine. And so this poor lady had to wait until they were both available. It just took forever and this lady had to sit in her own poo, which had also gone all over the floor. It was an infection risk and a slip risk and I was just thinking: this is a fucking nightmare.” An assistant nurse working in an aged care facility in Newcastle, NSW, says personal care, such as showers, is the first thing to suffer during staff shortages. There is also no time to talk with residents or take them outside. “When you’ve only got four staff you have to prioritise,” she says. “It means Betty down in room 204 might have to go without a shower. Safety, administering medication, watching dementia patients and preventing them from wandering and falling all have to come first. It’s not fair, because for some people, a shower is the only thing they have to look forward to. “Just in the past month, those hard choices have really had to be made. Yes, staffing was challenging before, but we were able to still provide personal care. The government is letting us all down with a lack of resources and support.” She says she loves her work, but the Omicron outbreak has compelled her to leave the industry. “Usually, at full staff for 256 residents, we would have two registered nurses, an enrolled nurse, and between seven to 10 staff on the floor,” she says. “Lately we have one registered nurse, often an agency nurse who doesn’t know the residents, and five or fewer staff on the floor. Up to 60% of our staff on any shift are wiped out. I get text messages every day from the person doing rosters saying they urgently need at least five people … it’s exhausting. I feel like I’m deserting my residents”. The final straw, she says, was when she was left managing the facility one night due to staff shortages – even though she is only qualified to work as an assistant nurse responsible for personal care. “The residents are like family to me and leaving is the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make,” she says. “But I’m going to work every day with anxiety thinking, ‘what am I going to be faced with today and how am I going to get through my shift?’. I’ve been placed in positions that I should never have been placed in since Omicron hit.” The only way to improve the situation is to make aged care more specialised, requiring a higher level of training and education nationally, and to increase pay substantially to reflect that training, the nurse says. She is angry that two years into the pandemic this is not happening. “We don’t just need more staff, we need the right staff,” she says. “When I did my course five years ago, 40% of the people that were there didn’t really want to do it. One of the questions we were asked was: ‘what would you do to make a person with dementia’s day better?’ And one person responded: ‘why would you bother to try since they don’t even remember anything anyway?’ “We need to make sure we’re attracting quality people who really want to be there and improving the level of education and pay is key to achieving that.” Amid growing unrest among staff, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on Monday that aged care workers would receive two pre-election bonus payments worth up to $800. The Health Services Union was scathing, describing it as “too little, too late” and inadequate to address gross underpayment spanning years. Meanwhile, family members of residents have taken to social media to share their stories, and have expressed anger at the deaths being described as in people who were “palliative” by the time they got Covid. Compiling experiences from a dementia unit in Victoria, one person described finding their father “swimming in faeces”. Another person couldn’t find their father in his room, only to discover he was “sitting asleep in the shower chair in the bathroom of another resident’s room”. The federal minister for aged care services, Richard Colbeck, told Guardian Australia the Omicron variant, combined with continued circulation of the Delta variant, was “significantly impacting the residential aged care sector”. But he says the spread in aged care was being driven by community transmission and not through a lack of aged care resources. He denied there was a lack of booster shots being administered or poor infection control. “The strongest predictor of cases in aged care are high case numbers in the community – through staff exposures in the community, residents leaving the facility and visitors entering,” Colbeck said. “There has been an unprecedented increase in outbreaks in facilities over the last month, driven by significant increases in cases in the community. Each outbreak has different factors that impact the risk of transmission on site.” But Russell rejects this assessment. “He always uses community transmission as an excuse,” Russell says. “His job is to protect residents in the face of community transmission. The way to do that is to get people their booster shots and get rapid antigen tests and staff before they [governments] let it rip.” Carolyn Smith is the national aged care director for the United Workers Union, which represents workers in aged care. The latest outbreaks – and deaths – were evidence that aged care homes were unprepared and abandoned by the government to “fend for themselves”, she says. “Workers have told us there is no visible surge workforce, the booster program has been a shambles, many facilities lack even the most basic PPE, and RAT tests have not been available.” Queensland aged care worker Mandy says none of the staff where she works were RAT-tested, despite an Omicron outbreak in the home. “Rumour has it that some are coming in – everything is rumour,” she says. Meanwhile double shifts are being regularly requested. “You almost feel like you are coerced into doing them … I said I can’t leave my dog 16 hours so they said I could have my dog on site for the second shift. There are no signs of a surge workforce. “We have no cleaner, we have no cook. I worked my day off as a cook. I’m not trained as a cook – it’s that desperate.” She says staff were made to work between parts of the facility with Covid-positive and Covid-negative residents – and that at the start of the outbreak there was confusion when it came to donning and doffing PPE. “N95 masks didn’t start coming out until staff and residents began getting sick – so too late,” she says. Prof Nigel McMillan, the head of infectious diseases from the Menzies Health Institute in Queensland, says N95 masks are the only type that should be used by aged care workers during the Omicron outbreak. “N95 are well known to be the most effective, and surgical or cloth masks are not going to do a good job,” he says. Mandy says while staff struggled, isolated residents suffered the most. “We had one dementia resident [in isolation in their room] who had no TV, radio, nothing,” she says. “Frustrated, angry residents see it as being our fault they are locked up. I care. Who is going to look after these people if we don’t? But we’re an ageing workforce. I’m 58. Half our staff are over 50. And plenty are getting to the point where this is the last straw.”",News/Australia news,‘Yelling out for help’: the atrocious conditions inside Australia’s aged care homes,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/05/yelling-out-for-help-the-atrocious-conditions-inside-australias-aged-care-homes
2/5/2022,"John Souisa had spent five days at sea when relief washed over him – the Australian navy was approaching their boat, which was carrying 53 asylum seekers. After dodging Indonesian patrols, battling rough seas, and warding off hunger, the group had finally made it. And just off the coast of Darwin, a huge warship was there to guide them safely to shore.  It was the year 2000 and behind them, John and his son Paul had left a terrible conflict in a remote and rarely visited part of Indonesia, one that led to more than 5,000 deaths and the displacement of 700,000 people. On 16 January this year, John, 78, became one of the 42 South Australians to die from Covid that day. He chose not to get vaccinated and deteriorated so rapidly after going to hospital that his son did not get to say a proper goodbye. “He was a great man,” says Paul. “He was brave and always encouraged others. He cared about the human rights issues of his country.” Paul thinks his father died from medical negligence after doctors refused to treat John with ivermectin – an antiparasitic drug that has been widely debunked as a treatment for Covid. “I advised the doctor, I would like to hold his hand. The doctor said you cannot do that. We won’t allow you to do that.” The Australia that John and Paul encountered when they arrived in the year 2000 was a much more welcoming place than refugees find today. The Howard government had not started playing the “tough on border” politics that would dominate national discussion for the decade to come. The Tampa crisis, where a Norwegian cargo ship carrying 433 asylum seekers it had rescued was denied permission to enter Australian waters, was still more than a year away. John’s boat would be highlighted in cabinet two months after its arrival when then-immigration minister Philip Ruddock noted it. His submission began: “A boat carrying 52 Christians from Maluku province, Indonesia, was intercepted on 22 January 2000.” Cabinet historian Chris Wallace would later write: “This opening sentence from immigration and multicultural affairs minister Philip Ruddock’s cabinet submission to cabinet’s national security committee quietly foreshadowed a new era of Australian politics which would explode the following year in the Tampa crisis.” The Maluku Islands are known for their abundance of clove and nutmeg. The spices have sat at the heart of the centuries-old colonial struggle for ownership of the archipelago. The islands, which had a population of 1.7 million in 2019, were ruled by Indonesia in the 1990s when tensions broke out between the Muslim and Christian communities. “It was a holy war,” Paul says. “Before the war, it was a beautiful island, there was peace and harmony between Christians and Muslims. “There was no help from other nations. Everyone was silent. Even Australia was silent and Indonesia thought they had control.” The Indonesian military claims to have stayed neutral throughout the conflict, but some records show it fired 80% of the ammunition expended. Paul accuses the government of wanting to destroy the islands’ Pela Gandong culture – where people live as equals despite differences in belief or ethnicity. John found himself in the middle of this conflict. A skilled mariner, John grew up on the island of Java before joining the Indonesian defence force at 17. He was sent to Russia for training and rose through the ranks to work on the KRI Samadikun destroyer – Indonesia’s best warship at the time. A sergeant living on a naval base with his young son, who was not born on the islands, was not the typical recruit for the independence movement. But through a family connection, by chance John met the first president of independent Maluku, Johanis Hermanus Manuhutu, just before he died in 1983, and during their meeting was recruited to their cause. “He was chosen to become part of the high command for freedom fighters,” Paul says. The late 90s was a troubled time for the area, with the fall of Indonesian president Suharto, who was widely acknowledged as a dictator, and the wider Asian financial crisis flaring tensions across the archipelago. In 1998, Maluku was about to descend into a brutal armed conflict. The navy became suspicious of John’s allegiances and held him as a political prisoner. “He was beaten, he was tortured. We would visit him to bring food, they didn’t give him enough food [to survive],” Paul says. After a year his case was investigated. There was no evidence John had received financial help from the Maluku government in the Netherlands so they released him just as fighting between Christians and Muslims broke out. The fighting was brutal, with religious militia from both sides waging attacks on homes, schools, places of worship and markets. Rumours fuelled the conflict, with mobs burning houses to the ground and murdering children in broad daylight. Residents of both faiths tried to stop the fighting, but the violence spread to the surrounding islands. “They were targeting us. We were not safe,” Paul, who was 18 at the time, says. “I asked my father to bring us to Australia, and my father said yes. We were waiting for money from the Netherlands because our family boats were broken, we needed to fix it so we could go. “The villages around us were burning, people were dying.” At the harbour one day Paul met another Christian who had gathered a group together and was planning to flee. “They had a boat but they didn’t have a captain. Our group had a captain but no boat. It was a good match,” Paul says. “Because my father had travelled a lot with the navy, he knew the routes of their patrols, so he could avoid them. “He read the stars, he only used a compass and map. We made a tent at the front of the fishing boat to cover our heads to sit under.” On the second day, the boat had run out of food so they stopped at Wetar Island near Timor. At first the locals were apprehensive, but one person who could speak the dialect explained they were leaving for Australia. “They came to pick us up in a traditional canoe and take us to shore. They welcomed us, they climbed the coconut tree to give us food and sukun, a tropical fruit, to take with us to Darwin.” Word travels fast on a small island and soon the police arrived. The younger men from the boat wanted to fight them off, and John knew if the police caught on to where they were going they might be killed. John told the asylum seekers to turn out their pockets and used the money to bribe the police into leaving for the night. “In the middle of the night at full speed, he took off,” Paul says. The elation of escape was short-lived. In the morning, a huge storm descended on them, snapping the chain that connected the steering wheel to the engine. “There were huge waves, it was smashing our boat,” says Paul. “People were panicked and crying. Some of them even said we have to throw our gold or rings in the water, just to pay it off. “I was praying, I was scared, I thought this was the end of our life.” Using a piece of twine, John managed to fix the chain. By the morning, he could steer again, and the waters were completely still. “For us, we thought we were going in circles. The fishing boats don’t go fast, but my father knew exactly where he was heading.” After five days at sea, an aeroplane appeared in the sky. Excited, the group unravelled an SOS banner they had made before leaving. They watched the aeroplane fly away, and for an excruciating moment, the boat was completely alone again in the vast expanse of ocean – until the line on the horizon was interrupted by a small black dot. An Australian warship had arrived to help them navigate the reef around the coastline and get them safely to Darwin. The asylum seekers were taken to Port Hedland, where they stayed for a total of 10 weeks. Afraid to set up a new life in a foreign country, 40 of them decided to return to Indonesia while the other 14 relocated to Adelaide, Paul says. The difference in experience to how modern asylum seekers – who are now locked up indefinitely for years – are treated is stark. Paul knows they were “very lucky with the timing” of their arrival. “The Australian government needs to change the policy, it’s not fair for human rights,” he says of the situation now. With help from the government and the Uniting Church, Paul and his father made a new life for themselves. Paul worked in various jobs to support John, who never stopped campaigning for Moluccan independence. “He fought his whole life for independence,” Paul says. “He was a political prisoner, he was chosen by his underground government to become a high commander for the freedom movement, he met with Alexander Downer and sent letters to John Howard.” John’s greatest wish – to see a free and independent Maluku – is far from reality, but now Paul will take up the mantle. “I am grateful for the Australian government and I was thankful they protected us,” he says. “But still, not enough has been done for what we are asking for. We are asking the government to help the Maluku Islands.”",News/Australia news,‘He fought his whole life’: independence advocate who fled persecution dies from Covid-19,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/05/he-fought-his-whole-life-independence-advocate-who-fled-persecution-dies-from-covid-19
2/5/2022,"Scott Morrison doesn’t have to imagine the things that could cost him government in a few months’ time. Chaos and animus closed in this week. New South Wales – the division supposed to deliver the Coalition its fourth federal term – made a big show of resisting Morrison’s urgent electoral imperatives, and the brinkmanship of his proxies intent on shoring up their own preselections. Morrison needed tranquility, and the state division of the Liberal party obliged him by roiling.  The bushfire in the Coalition’s base also burned through to Canberra. Protesters opposed to vaccine mandates – Australians who feel economically and culturally dispossessed by the creep of government during pandemic – spilled up the forecourt of Parliament House. There were sovereign citizens, anti-vaxxers, doomsday preppers, Trumpers and enraged owner-drivers, yes; but also grey nomads with packed lunches, Thermos flasks and sunsmart hats. A woman from a property just out of town told me she was there because it was impossible to know what, or who, to believe any more. Nothing made much sense. Most people, she thought, just needed simple solutions. When the freedom lovers learned Morrison wasn’t in his office, the convoy rolled out their swags in the parliamentary triangle, and then converged on the National Press Club on Tuesday. Morrison had gone there to change the conversation about the election. The prime minister knows voters want to give him a kicking because they are exhausted and frustrated by a government that seems to repeat its past failures of anticipation in an endless loop. But some of the backlash isn’t yet baked in. Tuesday was about giving Australians permission to forgive him. The self-interest here is obvious: if voters hold a grudge, Morrison is all out of miracles. Morrison on Tuesday was sorry, not sorry – sorry enough to soften the edges of prime ministerial arrogance, but not sorry enough to accept any serious liability. He was sorry he was too optimistic before the summer. He had got people’s hopes up, and Omicron had dashed them. He was sorry he hadn’t sent in the army sooner to correct the infamous vaccine “strollout”. But self-initiated show trials have limits. Morrison submitted his plea bargain. Dealing with Omicron was like dealing with a whole new virus. So the undertone of Tuesday’s reboot was: shit happens, guys, it’s not really fair to blame me. Given this was courtship, the prime minister praised the good sense of the Australian people. Australians were too smart to “have an each way bet on Australia’s economic future and our national security” by voting Labor. People would “make careful judgments about what’s important, and they know that the times we face are very challenging”. With Morrison there is always a line, a crescendo that he builds to, and we got there eventually. The prime minister declared the coming election was not a referendum on the government’s performance. Elections were sober risk-management exercises, not expressions of transient pique. It was the frustration flip. It’s what leaders under political pressure do. John Howard pulled this same pea-and-thimble trick in more than one election – I know you are sick of this, I know you don’t entirely trust me, but trust me – you trust that other bloke a whole lot less. If you can land the flip, you win. If you can’t, you bleed out. You become a memory, a jumble of anecdotes, a portrait on the wall of the Liberal party room. Morrison is fighting for his political life, but he kept his presentation workmanlike, perhaps even dour. Tuesday’s tamped-down performance felt deliberate. Telling people an election is not a referendum on the performance of a government – when it very obviously is – is an act of hypnotism. The hypnotist’s trick is monotone, no sudden movements. Or possibly he was just exhausted. There could be no covert mini-break in Hawaii during the dispiriting summer of Omicron. Morrison had to plough through his miscalculations in the arid company of the premiers. Rhetorically, the press club reboot was textbook. But Morrison’s problem was that everything was out of sync. All the visual cues said siege and encirclement. As the prime minister spoke, sporadic bursts of fury were audible from outside. “Remove ScoMo.” “No vaccine mandates.” If the protesters had been climate activists in koala suits, nothing would have seemed amiss. But this was a convoy of rightwing grievance. This crowd would have given “ScoMo” version 2019™ the thumbs up before the pandemic. The persistent ruckus outside put the twitch in Morrison’s security detail, who stood sentry at the perimeter of the room. The ill-temper also flared inside. Sky News Australia’s political editor, Andrew Clennell, wondered if the prime minister was sufficiently in touch to know how much a loaf of bread cost? (He wasn’t). Peter van Onselen of Network Ten, at the microphone, with mobile phone in hand, wondered whether Morrison agreed with the assessment of an unnamed colleague that he was a complete psycho. “I’ve been provided with a text message exchange between the former New South Wales premier and a current Liberal cabinet minister.” The room inhaled, and held its breath. “I’ve got them right here.” As Morrison absorbed the ambush, as colleagues watching on remotely wondered what he’d done to invite the wrath of the parliamentary press gallery, it was clear the combined might of Ray Hadley and Paul Murray would be required to sweep up the debris. Liberal prime ministers on the sticky paper are rarely bereft of media friends. This week was a cyclone. It shook the government. In the past, Morrison’s faith in himself has been absolute. He knows he can win. He’s done it before. He also knows his opponent lacks that certainty. Elections are battles of strategy and psychology. Anthony Albanese has a taller mountain to climb because he has to imagine winning. He hasn’t yet been on the podium. But Morrison’s frustration flip didn’t quite stick. So the confidence player, the relentless bulldozer, looked a bit battered and bruised. Behind the prime minister’s eyes was a flicker of self-pity. Right now, Morrison’s belief has been downgraded to hope. Hope the cosmos hasn’t shifted. Hope that Albanese isn’t about to inherit the earth. Assuming they are accurate, opinion polls tell the story. If you can’t read a poll, you can ring any number of government MPs who will tell you the Coalition would lose any election held today. People say voters are mulish; sick of the pandemic and its uncertainty, sick of the governments they rewarded for most of the first two years of this crisis, and sick most of all of Morrison. Metropolitan Liberals are also worried professional women are waiting for Morrison with baseball bats after the prime minister’s very obvious failure to rise to the occasion during federal parliament’s #MeToo reckoning. That visceral anger, Liberals say, has not dissipated. Some fear the coming election is already lost. Others are more optimistic. They point to the government’s key structural advantage after the Labor rout in 2019 – seats held with significant margins. Some MPs say they are more confident of hanging on now than they were during the last election. Basic electoral mathematics suggest that in the absence of a decisive anti-government swing in all the right seats in the right parts of the country, Albanese is going to struggle to get a majority. Most elections are tight. The routs are rare. This could all change in a heartbeat, but right at the moment, it looks as though there are enough Liberals who are inclined to hope to keep Morrison in his job. When you ask key people whether the government plans to dish up its habitual pre-match unhinging – change the leader, deliver a budget and speed up Dunrossil Drive to see the governor general – the response is there’s not enough time, and not enough internal consensus, to change the frontman. Not at the moment. As one Liberal puts it: “We didn’t win in 2019 because we changed the leader, we won despite that.” One of the avowed optimists is veteran MP Warren Entsch, who holds the north Queensland electorate of Leichhardt – one of three seats Labor is targeting in that state. Enstch wanted to retire, but was persuaded to hold on to maximise the chance of retaining the seat. He extracted a significant price. Morrison agreed to a reinsurance scheme for north Queensland in last year’s budget, and more funding for the Great Barrier Reef. Entsch says when Morrison ventured north over the summer, he braced himself for trouble from disaffected locals, but the opposite happened. The prime minister was “well received”. He says businesses in the electorate are starting to fret that Morrison will lose. He thinks when the time comes to cast a ballot, his constituents will be more inclined to forgiveness than retribution. “There’s no scripted plan for how you deal with a pandemic,” Entsch says. There has certainly been a local backlash about the slow pace of vaccinations, and one about mandates. “I still get people screaming at me that vaccines are experimental drugs,” Entsch says. “Look you are damned if you do and damned if you don’t. But generally, people think he’s done a good job.” If in doubt, generate new television pictures. Breaking. Morrison finally held a hose. The prime minister was out in Melbourne on Friday, hamming it up at a hairdresser, washing the various derangements and disappointments of the week out of the hair of a voter. Back in the capital, police were attempting to move protesters out of their new Canberra campsite. Resolutely off-camera, an attempt was also under way to secure a truce in the civil war inside the NSW division of the Liberal party – to agree on a path for the remaining preselections before any more explosive texts emerged. The vicious factional warfare in Morrison’s home state appeared to be the backdrop for the exchange revealed on Tuesday by Van Onselen – a Liberal minister allegedly calling Morrison a “complete psycho” and Berejiklian allegedly branding him a “horrible, horrible” man. Van Onselen says the anonymous minister is one of Morrison’s colleagues. Morrison isn’t loved beyond his circle of intimates, and it is entirely plausible frustration could have boiled over during a tense moment. But a number of senior government players are privately sceptical. The theory goes that a conversation like the one depicted in the reporter’s account of the texts could only have happened between Berejiklian and one of the former premier’s two long-term friends in Canberra – Paul Fletcher or Marise Payne. Both have denied it was them, and no one believes either would be loose enough to flame the prime minister in a discoverable exchange, and then leak it afterwards to blow up the government in sight of an election. People smell bullshit. But the purveyors of truthiness also know any scepticism is academic. When things unravel in politics, facts can become technicalities rather than fixed points. As the government limped towards the weekend, a truce in NSW looked more possible because of electoral necessity. No one wants to be blamed for sinking Morrison’s re-election chances. Although you have to wonder how long a Band-Aid adheres to an open wound. And there was more trouble on Friday night when a fresh text exchange critical of Morrison surfaced. In a private message last March to the former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins, passed on to her by a third party, Barnaby Joyce – then a backbencher – supplied another excoriation. Joyce, candid as ever, said he did not get along with Morrison. He found the prime minister “a hypocrite and a liar” – a person he had “never trusted”. This bracing character assessment surfaced as a controlled detonation – with both Morrison and Joyce issuing separate statements lauding their current relationship. Adding to the sense of a government fraying in plain sight, Morrison’s base leakage problem also persists. Activists in yellow United Australia party T-shirts weaved through the crowd at the Canberra protests this week. Clive Palmer helped Morrison defeat Bill Shorten in 2019. Morrison’s miracle was secured in part by Palmer’s stonking advertising buy. But things could be different this time – if Craig Kelly’s testimony can be taken as gospel. Kelly, the former Liberal, now parliamentary leader of the UAP, says Palmer wants to win the balance of power in both Houses of Parliament, not re-elect Morrison. When I tell him I cannot see a former Liberal, like him, and Palmer, acting against the political interests of the Coalition, he points me to the current field evidence. “This time, there’s been millions of dollars spent attacking the prime minister,” he says. “We did a YouTube ad featuring the prime minister saying there would be no vaccine mandates in the country. That spend was over $1m. We did that on television as well. So this time, you can’t accuse us of putting all the advertising money into attacking the Labor party, in fact if you look at a lot of the advertising, it’s attacking the government.” The goal is balance of power, then a burst of frenzied horse-trading. “We would have a shopping list of demands and we would horse trade between the two parties. We’d do a reverse auction.” Kelly wraps with never a truer word. “We are equal opportunists.” As well as the rusting-off on the right flank, the government is also battling disaffection in the centre. Liberals are facing competition from the teal independents in a number of heartland city seats. Some Liberals in these contests think community interest in the Climate 200-backed independents may have peaked too early in the political cycle. The former ABC journalist Zoe Daniel is running against Liberal Tim Wilson in the seat of Goldstein. When I put this view from Liberals to her, she is surprised. “I don’t get any sense of anything going off the boil. The only thing I’d say is it was Christmas and new year. Everyone was engaged in their holidays then getting kids back to school. I’ve detected in the last week a real resetting – people saying ‘let’s go, we are going sprint from here to the election’.” I ask whether locals are negative about Morrison. “Yeah, I think so. There’s a trust gap and the trust gap continues to widen,” Daniel says. “There is definitely an anti-Scott Morrison sentiment among a lot of the people I talk to. “My husband and I went up the street and had a glass of wine with some of the residents up the hill and there were about 15 people there and they were all older, long-term residents of Goldstein, lifelong Liberal voters. I think of the 15 of them, only one had decided not to vote for me. That person had a personal relationship with the incumbent. “That, to me, was really interesting, that those people of a particular older conservative demographic who have voted a particular way forever, had decided to vote differently because of their frustration on the integrity issue and the trust issue.” She thinks the coming election will be a referendum on the government, and on politics as usual. “People are really over it. They feel like the status quo is not good enough and they want something different. They are looking for sincerity and honesty and accountability. “The main thing you get from people when you talk to them in the street is that shake of the head, of ‘Oh God, we’ve got to change something … we want someone who will get in there and speak for us sincerely’. That comes across incredibly strongly, even when I talk to people who have voted Liberal all their lives, which is a lot of people in this electorate.”",News/Australia news,"Frustrated, frazzled and under siege – Scott Morrison’s faith in himself takes a hit",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/05/frustrated-frazzled-and-under-siege-scott-morrisons-faith-in-himself-takes-a-hit
2/5/2022,"The Yawuru people of the west Kimberley have a philosophy of “mabu liyan”. Literally translated as “good/strong spirit”, it is a way of living well, with all the things that give meaning to their lives – country, people, community and culture. Yawuru woman Nini Mills, who is the chief executive of the Nyamba Buru Yawuru (NBY), Yawuru’s development and investment company, explains it better: “‘Mabu’ means good in Yawuru language, and ‘liyan’ is a Yawuru word used throughout the west Kimberley and it can be described in many ways. For Yawuru people, it’s your spirit, your intuition, your moral compass.  “Our broader vision is to create mabu liyan for always, and we want Yawuru people to have strong spirit and a strong sense of well being. “The stronger your connection to all of those facets, the stronger your spirit will be. And when your spirit is empowered, it enables you to move forward in the modern society that we live in today, being grounded in your cultural identity and values.” This week, Yawuru took over the pastoral operations at Roebuck Plains Station and export hub on Gumaranganyjal, near Broome. It’s been a long story. In 2006, Yawuru were granted native title over more than 530,000 hectares of their traditional country, including the land and waters in and around Rubibi (the town of Broome). In 2014, the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation (ILSC) – the federal organisation set up to assist traditional owners acquire and manage rights and interests in land, salt water and fresh water country – bought Roebuck Plains station and export depot and then managed both of them until the Yawuru were ready to take over the reins themselves, which officially happened this week. The station is located on rich marine floodplains 30km east of Broome, with the capacity to support 20,000 head of cattle. The business will support training and employment opportunities for young people on country. Mills says taking over the station means a new era for Yawuru participation in the cattle and pastoral industries in the Kimberley, which were built on “the back of our old people’s blood, sweat and tears”. “For us to now be in the position to take control of the station is a tribute to their legacy and their sacrifice,” she says. “I think of the resilience that must have taken for them to hold that vision, under their predicament, at that point in time. It’s phenomenal.” The Yawuru worldview means balancing those interests with important cultural and environmental values, such as teaching the young people and taking care of important natural and cultural sites, Mills says. “Our approach is factoring in broader and sustainable opportunities for Yawuru people. So, yes, we’ll be looking for people to work on the cattle station itself but we have an Indigenous Protected Area, and fundamental to protecting that is to ensure that we have Yawuru people in positions there. “Our old people have set a vision that we’re committed to, so this new opportunity for us is to ensure that it’s not just a job, the contribution is much more meaningful.” Dianne Appleby’s father, Thomas Edgar, was an important figure in the history of Roebuck Plains station, where he was known as the “windmill man” because of his cultural knowledge of the water of the plains and the surrounding hinterland. “[My father] was a man of great learning, learning it from a country that was rich, and he gave that learning to others. So many of them – my grandfathers, my uncles and aunties and my grandmothers – all did the same thing,” Appleby says. “My mother said when you teach, you teach with mabu liyan, you teach with good liyan, good feeling. How you expect people to learn if you are bitter? That’s what she tells me. Very wise words, my mother: how do you expect people to respect you if you’re going to be bitter?” As part of the transfer of management of the station, NBY will buy 15,000 head of cattle from the ILSC. The return of the station makes Appleby think back to when the first Europeans arrived, and the way they treated Yawuru elders in their quest for grazing land. “By the 1800s Aboriginal women and men of Yawuru descent as well as the other neighbouring groups came to work on Roebuck plains,” Appleby says. “We still had our senior elders with us telling us of these stories that are so significant, so strong. They never forgot the dreaming of these areas. “They said: we need this country because the country is part of us. We’ve tilled this soil, we’ve worked on the soil, we’ve slept on this soil, the Earth that has so much meaning to us. But we built those fences as well, with our bare hands. “The care for this country has always been in our heart, to remain true to those things.” She was asked to speak with the current cohort of young Yawuru people in the traineeship program on the station. “Going there and sitting and feeling and smelling the country gives me a sense of pride in what my old people did, of sharing everything to us and giving back to us. “Because my mother said, don’t ever hold back, give it back so that we can continue the good stories, the good fight, the pride that we want to give back to our children. “This news of Gumaranganyjal, which is the country and the station, now back into Yawuru possession, that is the most wonderful thing.”",News/Australia news,‘The good fight’: Roebuck Plains Station and its return to Indigenous owners – photo essay,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/05/the-good-fight-roebuck-plains-station-and-its-return-to-indigenous-owners-photo-essay
2/5/2022,"Of all the unhelpful and saccharine career aphorisms in recent times, surely the most grating is “do what you love, and you will never work a day in your life”. Close on its heels in second place comes the quote by the late mythologist Joseph Campbell, who encouraged his students to “follow their bliss”, a comment which has been co-opted and de-contextualised by the inspirational quotes crowd and is responsible for launching a million pilgrimages of self-discovery to India.  These days, the holy grail of work is to find a job that taps our deepest talents, transforms us as people and pays the bills. Good-enough work, work we don’t hate, will simply not do; we must find a job we love, or die hustling. As US journalist Sarah Jaffe writes in her book Work Won’t Love You Back: How Devotion to Our Jobs Keeps Us Exploited, Exhausted and Alone: “The idea that work should be a source of fulfilment has become common sense in our world, to the extent that saying otherwise is an act of rebellion.” Inundated with messages about our right to deeply fulfilling work, many of us try to shoehorn our passion, that thing we love doing when we are not at work, into billable hours. In doing so we run the risk of commodifying it, of transforming the passion into a joyless chore that calcifies within the constraints of the labour model. What is joyful, creative and fun becomes hard graft. A friend of mine worked in a bookstore in his 20s and during those years he stopped reading novels as they became too closely associated with the nine-to-five. Another friend has sworn off fiction entirely because he teaches English five days a week and would prefer not to be reminded of sentences when he is at home. Why do we do this to that which we love? Surely we enjoy our hobbies and our passions largely because they are not work? Why can’t we just let work be what it inherently is, which is to say, work? To be fair, sometimes this relentless passion-seeking pays off. Sometimes an account manager really does need to quit her job to become a yoga instructor and she, and the world, are richer for it. Sometimes the right path really is a miraculous Venn diagram of overlapping passion and clamouring market demand. Many of us are grateful to the artists and writers who throw caution to the wind and devote their life to their passion, sans back-up plan. But to promote this path as the key to a fulfilling career is to succumb to the late-capitalist ideology that work must complete us. After all, it’s easier to labour under the illusion that the perfect job, like the perfect relationship, is out there somewhere, just waiting to receive our passions and abilities, rather than face the sobering reality that work is mostly what we make of it. To be clear, I am not advocating that we should accept the hellishness of a toxic work culture. Nor should we put up with work that is dehumanising. There is nothing noble or edifying about sticking at a job you hate, of living for the weekends, of smiling and nodding in meetings until you lose the will to live. I’ve been in these jobs, and no amount of positive thinking, meditation or team development days were going to change my mind about it. Thus the solution to soul-crushing work is not likely to be found in monetising our passions, but in seeking out “good-enough” work that is well-suited to our skills and personalities. It will look slightly different for each of us but for me good-enough work is defined by a measure of autonomy so I can make the work mine and thereby meaningful. Good-enough work also allows me the space to pursue my true passion: pretending to write a novel, while taking pictures of my dog in weird outfits. So perhaps to really “follow our bliss” we should begin by seeking out jobs that don’t ask us to forfeit so much of ourselves; a career, in other words, that allows for enough mental real estate at the end of the workday for us to enjoy the passions and the people that we love and that, crucially, love us back.

2/5/2022,"While economists parse every Reserve Bank of Australia murmur on what it implies for interest rates, there’s another variable many of us will be eyeing just as closely now global borders are finally opening up: the Australian dollar. And oddly enough, the central bank is not a very helpful guide at all, and nor, it turns out, is the government, when it comes to the exchange rate.  Here’s where analysts think the Australian dollar is headed, and why those outward bound may have additional reasons for cheer. As of mid-Friday afternoon AEDT, the Australian dollar was buying 71.4 US cents, a rise of about 2% over the past week. The trade-weighted index, based on the composition of Australia’s merchandise goods and services trade, was sitting at 60.1 as of Friday’s close. (China’s yuan is about a third of the weight.) These are good markers because those two rates – 71 US cents and a TWI of 60 – also happen to match the assumed values used by the quarterly RBA’s Statement on Monetary Policy released by the central bank on Friday. Key RBA forecasts – such as GDP growth accelerating from 4.75% in 2021 to 5.5% in 2022 before slowing to a 2.5% clip in 2023 – are based in part on those exchange rates. The previous statement, in November, assumed 74 US cents and a TWI at 62. Commercial bank economists tend to be more optimistic about the dollar, at least against the greenback. Among the big banks, for instance, the ANZ expects the dollar to appreciate to 75 US cents by the end of year. NAB forecasts it will be worth about 77 US cents, Westpac 78 US cents, and the CBA 80 cents by then. That’s promising news if you’re planning that overseas trip, but it’s a trend that seems counterintuitive. Other central banks – such as the Bank of England earlier this week and the US Federal Reserve next month – have started to raise interest rates or soon will. The RBA, meanwhile, is only saying a rise in its official cash rate is “plausible” this year, and seems eager to hold off as long as possible. If other nations are paying more to hold their debt, shouldn’t the Aussie dollar wilt? No, says Catherine Birch, a senior ANZ economist: “The first six months of a [US] Fed tightening cycle are generally negative for the USD. This is because the bulk of positioning adjustment has occurred well in advance of the first actual hike. This cycle looks no different.” Kim Mundy, a senior CBA currency strategist, agrees: “[T]he global economy will have more momentum – and more inflation – at the start of this tightening cycle than in any other cycle of the past four decades. This should support assets like the AUD that are leveraged to the global cycle.” In other words, Australian rocks and other commodities are in demand, and hence the Aussie dollars needed to acquire them. If the Aussie dollar appreciates, it will be getting closer to its “fair value”. According to CBA’s Mundy, the dollar is “significantly undervalued”, at least according to a calculation based on the RBA’s commodity price index and relative interest rate differentials between Australia and the US. “We estimate fair value is centred on 86 [US] cents,” she says. The calculus, then, implies the Australian dollar should be about 20% stronger. Interestingly, that differential is not far off another popular international gauge, the Economist’s Big Mac Index. Running since 1986, the index tracks how much a hamburger that is essentially identical around the globe costs in different nations. “A Big Mac costs A$6.40 in Australia and US$5.81 in the United States,” the newspaper said this week. “The implied exchange rate is 1.10. The difference between this and the actual exchange rate, 1.42, [and] suggests the Australian dollar is 22.4% undervalued.” Apart from buying more overseas, a stronger dollar has implications for those RBA and government forecasts. Mind you, the central bank is fully cognisant that exchange rates shift, but views it a mug’s game to try to predict them. Instead, they base each quarterly set of predictions on the Aussie dollar’s value at the time. The RBA deputy governor, Luci Ellis, explained the logic in a speech last year where she noted that – particularly in the midst of a pandemic – “forecasting in this environment is inevitably an exercise in humility”. The federal government operates along similar lines, and so its mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) is based on the dollar at 75 US cents and 62 on the TWI that prevailed at the time it was compiled by Treasury. The RBA typically doesn’t publish a range of scenarios but it did explore what the effects of currency changes would be on other forecasts in a 2019 monetary policy statement. It examined what a sustained 5% depreciation of the exchange rate would do, but the reverse can also be assumed if the dollar strengthened. GDP growth would be roughly half a percentage point lower than in the central forecasts at that time with a 5% stronger dollar. Such a shift in the exchange rate – if not more – is what private economists are tipping. The slowdown in GDP growth largely reflects a substitution away from Australian goods and services following the exchange rate appreciation, which leads to a rise in imports and a drop in export volumes. The jobless rate would be 0.4 percentage points higher and the year-ended trimmed mean inflation – used by the RBA in its rates decision – drops by about 0.3 percentage point under this 5% strengthening scenario for the Aussie dollar, all else being equal. Justin Smirk, a senior Westpac economist, said his bank incorporates those influences in its rate outlook. “[I]f our forecasts are correct, we will see more benefit of a stronger AUD in moderating Australian inflationary pressures in 2023-2024,” he says. And so, should a stronger dollar come to pass, some of the pressure on the RBA to lift interest rates this year and beyond could ease. If so, those on variable mortgage rates might have cause to celebrate – perhaps with an overseas holiday.",News/Business,Why the price of a Big Mac tells us the Australian dollar is undervalued – and most economists agree,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/05/why-the-price-of-a-big-mac-tells-us-the-australian-dollar-is-undervalued-and-most-economists-agree
2/5/2022," For fans of: The Black Crowes, Audioslave, Myles Kennedy If you are the type of music fan who keeps the dial locked to Triple M and has the Four Symbols tattooed on your skin, you may be a little bemused at recent reports of guitar music receding from the culture, of pop stars and hip-hop producers crowding charts. If this is you, the Black Cardinals are your new favourite band – a riff-roaring, stage-stalking rock’n’roll beast, possessing all the swagger of Jagger and none of the Maroon 5 references. Built upon a distorted Eastern guitar riff that sits somewhere between Cochise by Audioslave, Israel’s Son by Silverchair and the Party of Five theme, vocalist Craig Cassar roars like the third Robinson brother, alongside a band that deals out a steady, bluesy backbeat. You better believe all this is leading to a thrilling wah-wah-assisted shredding solo. Lighters out, please.

For fans of: Charli XCX, Solange, Madonna After years of jangle pop tunes and sugary shoegaze, Harriet Pilbeam has spun on to the dancefloor, with Quicksand sounding suspiciously like the pop music of 2022. This is quite a stylistic shift from an artist whose music previously sat somewhere between the twee songs of Sarah Records and pedal-crushers like Ride and Slowdive, but it works a treat. Quicksand contains the same glittering joy of Madonna’s William Orbit tunes, with underwater reverb swimming towards a euphoric chorus that just might cross over into So Fresh territory. Despite her claims in the chorus of sinking into quicksand, Hatchie soars well above the terrain on this skybound gem. For more: Album Giving The World Away is out in April.

For fans of: Human League, Tears For Fears, Savage Garden It’s been 10 long years since Darren Hayes last released music, and given that Bruno Mars, the Weeknd and a host of other artists have since laid claim to his brand of eyeliner-smearing, 1985 AM disco – scoring billions of streams in the process – it’s high time the Brisbane boy returned to show the recent challengers just what a warm drum machine and his fantastic falsetto can really achieve. As is befitting of the man who could write a Savage Garden radio hit in his sleep, it takes all of five seconds for the song’s hook to present itself and worm into your brain, after which he pounds it over and over, as if triggering a soul sample. While Hayes’s version of EDM doesn’t involve a preprogrammed beat soullessly revving to a preordained drop, he achieves a similar effect in the bridge with a congo beat that sprints with wide-eyed, childlike excitement towards the hook. For more: Hayes is headlining the 2022 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade on 5 March. For fans of: MGMT, the Avalanches, Empire of the Sun A hypnotic call-and-response track that sees vocalist Jake Webb and guest Stella Donnelly almost stuck in a state of echolalia, the trance-like repetition of words and phrases creating a perfect rhythmic device. After the pair spend a few gleeful moments bouncing syllables at each other over a stabbing backing track, the track swells into a dreamy interlude that sounds like Luke Steele was tasked with soundtracking a NeverEnding Story remake. This is an extremely odd pop song, but it’s so damn hooky that its quirks will remain unexplored by many. Give it 20 listens and you’ll still be noticing cool little production flourishes buried in plain sight. For more: New album Are You Haunted? is out 22 February. For fans of: Teenage Fanclub, Big Star, the Springfields With an inbuilt swagger that sits at a slightly lagging tempo (akin to wandering through a pool with jeans on), The Cradle kicks the door down and saunters in confidently with the jangle and joy of a Teenage Fanclub song and a laconic antipodean drawl to boot. Sydney-based one-man-band A Place in the Sky is the product of Gavin Angus-Leppan’s lockdown malaise, with the fog of the shoegaze-style production at glorious odds with the bright vocal harmonies, major/minor melodic jumps, and the jingle jangle of a sunny morning peering through the curtains. It’s deceptively layered, with pitch-perfect vocal harmonies allowed to slightly drag, draped lazily across the main melody as if they were recorded in one take by a ragtag psychedelic collective. For more: EP Isolation is out now. For fans of: Augie March, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Anohni Always New Day Always beams in like a sepia-stained standard, the type of full-bodied record that would crackle out of old gramophones as couples slow-dance while the heartbroken fight back tears in the corner. Cummins’ voice is a truly arresting instrument – warm, deep, vulnerable and imbued with a timeless quality – which is good, considering it takes centre stage on this starkly rendered ballad, with a carefully strummed acoustic the only thing competing for space. A flourish of backing vocals swoop in towards the end and carries this criminally short song into the heavens as a calm washes over the world. For more: The entire Storm Queen album is similarly wonderful. For fans of: Baker Boy, Kendrick Lamar, Anderson .Paak First Nations artist Tasman Keith starts 2022 off the back of a Midnight Oil collaboration, an impressive team-up with rapper Kwame and a new contract with Sony. You’d be forgiven for thinking that Keith is ready to celebrate his recent wins; his laid-back flow certainly suggests he is having a relaxed time of it. But listen closely to the lyrics of 5FT FREESTYLE and you will see piles of bodies lying in his wake, as he slays time after time, rhyme after rhyme, with some of the deftest putdowns since Eminem decided to foster a grudge against Moby. “[I] swim good, to be Frank,” he starts, namechecking new labelmate Frank Ocean, in the only complementary shoutout on this track. I won’t go through all the one-liners, it’s more fun to go in blind, but rest assured, these are just the warning shots. For more: Keith is touring the east coast in March. For fans of: Holly Throsby, Big Scary, Judy Collins With all the stress of a dying planet, uncertain financial markets, a burgeoning civil war, the never-ending pandemic and leaders scoring brownie points on social media platforms owned by evil corporations – and the sale of Wordle – isn’t it time we all took a breath and turned towards something a little more gentle? I Believe in Kindness is a wispy tune, operating much as Savage Garden’s Affirmation did: a wishlist for a broken world. Mitchell believes in kindness, education, silence, conversation and love being an intrinsic part of human nature. It’s a good start. “Can you feel it?” she asks, and I almost can. For more: Lisa Mitchell will tour nationally from May to July. Her fourth album A Place to Fall Apart will be released in 2022. For fans of: Technotronic, Snap!, C&C Music Factory Back in the early 90s when Sydney dance label Central Station were pumping out faceless, interchangeable Eurotrash dance singles, hoping for one to land in the charts and make them a fortune, they would have jumped at the opportunity to release Feels Like a Different Thing. An anthemic dancefloor filler anchored by a bright, plastic piano sound and a drum machine breakbeat too obnoxious to argue with, Confidence Man seemingly wrench lyrics straight from an Aerobics Oz Style VHS and drench the chorus in life-affirming gospel vocals. Like they say, it feels like a different thing. For more: Confidence Man’s album Tilt is out 1 April. For fans of: Jen Buxton, Tim Rogers, Lincoln Le Fevre Camp Cope slide ever so masterfully into alt-country territory with Running With the Hurricane, the second taste of their third album following recent single Blue. Starting, like all good depressions do, in a hole she cannot climb out of, songwriter and vocalist Georgia Maq details her ceaseless, brutal self-examination. Luckily, the Melbourne trio deal in hope, too, with hard-won sentiments like “the only way out is up”, “breaking these chains”, and “I push through the pain” hollered hopefully towards the end of this hooky, heartfelt ode. It turns out that movement is the key – “moving with the bodies that move to a different sound” helping to push through the anguish. Luckily, with such a killer bassline, movement is irresistible. For more: Listen to recent single Blue. Album Running With the Hurricane is out 25 March.",Arts/Music,"Darren Hayes, Lisa Mitchell and Hatchie: Australia’s best new music for February",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/05/darren-hayes-lisa-mitchell-and-hatchie-australias-best-new-music-for-february
2/5/2022,"Preventing future pandemics at source would cost a small fraction of the damage already caused by viruses that jump from wildlife to people, according to scientists. Each year on average more than 3 million people die from zoonotic diseases, those that spill over from wildlife into humans, new analysis has calculated. Stopping the destruction of nature, which brings humans and wildlife into greater contact and results in spillover, would cost about $20bn a year, just 10% of the annual economic damage caused by zoonoses and 5% of the value of the lives lost.  The scientists heavily criticise approaches by global bodies and governments that focus only on preventing the spread of new viruses once they have infected humans, rather than tackling the root causes as well. “That premise is one of the greatest pieces of folly of modern times,” said Prof Aaron Bernstein, of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at Harvard University, who led the new assessment. It details three key actions: global surveillance of viruses in wildlife, better control of hunting and trade in wildlife, and stopping the razing of forests. These actions would also pay huge dividends in fighting the climate emergency and the biodiversity crisis. Wildlife is known to harbour vast numbers of viruses, and outbreaks are increasing in frequency and severity. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, experts have repeatedly warned that the root causes must be tackled. Inaction has left the world playing an “ill-fated game of Russian roulette with pathogens”, they have said, and protecting nature is vital to escape an “era of pandemics”. “Our salvation comes cheap [because] prevention is much cheaper than cures,” Bernstein said. “If Covid-19 taught us anything, it is that we absolutely cannot rely on post-spillover strategies alone to protect us. Spending only five cents on the dollar can help prevent the next tsunami of lives lost to pandemics by stopping the wave from ever emerging, instead of paying trillions to pick up the pieces.” Bernstein said action to stop pandemics at source had been ignored because pandemic response was led by medical scientists and organisations that were unfamiliar with the protection of nature in preventing spillover. “Also, this primary prevention does not result in profits for corporations,” he said. The analysis, published in Science Advances, uses stark language that is unusual in a scientific journal. “Prominent policymakers have promoted plans that argue the best ways to address future pandemic catastrophes should entail ‘detecting and containing emerging zoonotic threats’. In other words, we should take actions only after humans get sick. We sharply disagree,” it says. It specifically criticises the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB), a joint initiative of the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO), and a G20 high-level panel on financing for pandemic preparedness, whose reports and strategies do not mention tackling spillover. The analysis assesses every zoonotic virus over the last century known to have killed more than 10 people, including the Spanish flu, repeated bird flu outbreaks, Marburg virus, Lassa fever, Ebola, HIV, Nipah, West Nile, Sars, Chikungunya, Zika and Covid-19. The researchers calculated the average annual deaths and economic costs from these viruses and compared these with the cost of action to prevent spillover. They found the benefits of action were so large that it would be cost-effective even if it cut the risk of a major pandemic by only 1%. The action recommended includes a global project to identify wildlife viruses to highlight hotspots of danger, better enforcement of controls on hunting and trade in wildlife, and cutting deforestation. The cost-benefit analysis did not include the damage caused by family deaths, lost jobs, delayed medical treatments, and lost education, or the cost of viral outbreaks in livestock or crops, which can run to many billions of dollars. Prof Marcia Castro, also of Harvard University, said. “Making these investments in primary prevention brings returns to human health, environment, and economic development.” Neil Vora, an expert in outbreak response who worked on tackling Covid-19 in New York and is now at Conservation International, said: “Unfortunately, dominant voices in public health have historically neglected pandemic interventions like ending deforestation. This reflects a bias towards immediately measurable public health victories, such as the number of vaccines administered, over those that require a longer time horizon before their benefits are realised. Many of these distant benefits are immeasurable as their goal is for a pandemic not to occur at all.” A spokesperson for the GPMB said it supported the conclusions of the analysis. “We agree that there are substantial gaps in knowledge, institutional capacity and financial resources which limit the ability to avert pathogen emergence. We also agree that preventive action is substantially more cost-effective compared to the direct impact upon global economies and lives lost. Spillover and prevention at the source are specific areas of work that would benefit from global leadership.” The spokesperson said GPMB reports had noted that global health security requires systems to predict, prevent, identify and detect the emergence of pathogens with pandemic potential. A framework for monitoring the state of the world’s pandemic preparedness would be launched later in 2022, she said, and was “likely to include indicators related to biodiversity loss, deforestation, animal trade and animal health.” Prof Stuart Pimm, a co-author of the new analysis, said: “Pandemics are not a problem that are going to go away. The world’s human population is increasing and becoming very much more urbanised. It’s going to get worse and we’re going to be at greater risk.”",News/Environment,"Failure to prevent pandemics at source is ‘greatest folly’, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/04/failure-to-prevent-pandemics-at-source-is-greatest-folly-say-scientists
2/5/2022,"“It was never a good thing, a positive thing being Māori when I was growing up,” says Bic Runga. She sighs audibly into the phone. Runga, who is of Chinese and Ngāti Kahungunu descent, shot to international fame in her 20s with 1997 album Drive, and went on to become one of New Zealand’s leading songwriters. “I was someone that grew up with pretty sustained, garden-variety racism,” she says. “I don’t really have the words for it – it’s just like a wash of backdrop. It’s the actual scheme that the whole thing is built on … It’s like asking a fish to describe water. It’s in the very makeup – we’re a settler colony, you know?”  But Runga is now part of a wave of popular musicians who have not only embraced te reo Māori, the indigenous language of New Zealand, they have propelled it on to the world stage. The past three years have been marked by a series of high-profile releases by artists across the musical spectrum: Runga re-recorded hit single Sway as Haere Mai Ra, Rob Ruha and Ka Hao’s song 35 hit No 1 in January and became a TikTok sensation with tens of millions of shares, and Australian Idol winner Stan Walker released a full-length album in Māori. Last year saw Lorde’s release of an EP entirely in te reo, and some of the country’s most promising young performers – including TEEKs, whom Vogue called “the male Adele”, and country singer-songwriter Marlon Williams – now regularly perform in their native tongue. For many of them, the moment has been a long time coming. “When I first got into the industry, it was a ‘never’ thing: it was never gonna happen. It wasn’t a matter of if, or when, or how – it just wasn’t going to happen,” says Walker, a mainstay of New Zealand pop and R&B, who released Te Arohanui last year. Despite learning to speak Māori as a child, he says: “I had to build up the courage to be able to sing in my own language.” Runga didn’t learn to speak Māori as a child, and began exploring te reo translations of her music around two decades after her first album. “You feel quite cut off from your own culture – and in a way you’ve had to be cut off, in order to succeed and to thrive,” she says. For years in New Zealand, te reo Māori was violently suppressed, and students who spoke it in school were often beaten. As a result, many did not teach their children the language, and the portion of speakers dropped precipitously, to sit at around 1 to 3% of New Zealanders. “My grandparents were beaten for speaking their native tongue. My parents didn’t think anything of it because their parents never taught them,” Walker says. “My parents used to tell me, ‘the reo’s not going to get you anywhere, not going to get you a job’,” he says. “That’s what they were taught, and that’s all they knew.” When Dame Hinewehi Mohi stepped off stage after singing New Zealand’s national anthem at the 1999 rugby World Cup final, she was met with a wave of anger. Not for her voice – a bright, clear soprano – but for the language she sang in. Rather than the English verses considered traditional at the time, Mohi had sung the anthem in Māori, and taken the rugby union, broadcasters, crowd, and millions-strong broadcast audience by surprise. The backlash that followed shocked the softly spoken singer. “It was devastating at the time,” she says. In the years since, however, she has helped to shepherd in an era where the sound of te reo Māori is no longer a surprise to stadiums or radios. Mohi was one of the driving forces behind Waiata/Anthems, a compilation project released in 2019 that worked with artists – including Runga, Walker and TEEKS – to reimagine their songs in te reo Māori. “It was the most intense kind of work that I’d ever done in the music industry, but the most rewarding because people’s lives were changed,” she says. “The response from every artist that was involved was so overwhelming – and showed that there was a real desire to do this work and for people to reconnect with the language and culture.” Popular music gives the language a crucial platform, she says – for breaking down remaining stigma, and for normalising it in accessible, everyday ways. “Language is the cornerstone of our culture,” she says. “Without it we’re just paying lip service to our true identity.” Sir Tīmoti Kāretu, 84, is one of New Zealand’s foremost linguists, and has turned his hand to assisting artists to translate their songs. Brisk, no-nonsense, and known for his unwaveringly high standards, Kāretu says he welcomes the wave of te reo emerging in pop music. “If anybody’s going to go to all that trouble of learning it correctly, pronouncing it correctly and wants to sing in the language, then I think it’s good,” he says. “You could never get the same dissemination of language as you can through song. Song and music in every culture is one of the most important elements.” But the popularisation of te reo – particularly among Pākehā New Zealanders – can sometimes cause uneasiness, as well as celebration: why should those whose ancestors devoted their energy to wiping out the language now be welcome to embrace it? For those who have had their language stolen or suppressed, it can provoke feelings of shame or trauma at what was lost. Te Karehana Gardiner-Toi, who releases music as TEEKs, says he understands the reservations – but ultimately believes the language needs mass use to survive. “The more people that take up the language, the better,” he says. “I understand there is a little bit of controversy around that. But at the end of the day, I think for the language to thrive, we have to be able to let non-Māori in, to be a part of the healing. It’s going to take a collective effort.” Gardiner-Toi grew up listening to his father, a school principal, sitting in the lounge, composing waiata [Māori songs] on his guitar. The strum would echo through the house, he says, and through his childhood memories. Māoriness is part of his musicality, whether he is singing in te reo or English. “Even if my songs are not in te reo Māori, when I’m in public space, when I’m standing on stage, or if I have to say something – I always open in Māori, and I speak Māori first because it’s my first language. The more we hear it, the more it’s normalised. “I look at TikTok and see how far it’s travelled internationally, how all these different people from different cultures and different backgrounds are jumping on this train, embracing this language that they know nothing about, but it sounds good to them, and they appreciate good music? I don’t think the language is a barrier.” The rise of Māori culture in the music world is not only a matter of language, Runga says. Beneath the surface is an equity movement, working to get recognition, rights and royalties for the myriad of Māori artists who write waiata. “There’s a feeling you get, when you hear a haka and it’s making all your hair stand up.” She likens it to the poet Lorca’s discussion of duende, describing the dark, elemental or ineffable qualities of some artworks that prompt a visceral response. “It’s basically death and sex,” she says. It’s those attributes of Māori music and performance that she also wants to draw into music-making, Runga says, “bringing the really elemental parts into pop music, rather than just straight translations”. When Runga looks back on her younger self, projects she has collaborated and sung on like Te Ao Marama, the Lorde Māori-language EP, are some of what she wished she’d had. “If an international pop singer with that much reach had been singing in te reo Māori in the 80s when I was, you know, terrified, walking through the square past skinheads – I would have actually felt quite a lot more security in a cultural way,” she says. “I can’t say enough good stuff about that. It makes me want to cry.” For Walker, there’s a joy in seeing indigenous language as an insurgent force: infiltrating the mainstream, resonating through radio rotations, turning up as melodies the minds of those who might have disparaged it. “Suddenly our reo has made its way, through music, into people that wouldn’t necessarily ever have accepted it,” he says. “The same people who will write nasty comments are humming these songs.”",News/World news,From outrage to No 1 hits: how Māori musicians conquered the charts in their own language,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/from-outrage-to-no-1-hits-how-maori-musicians-conquered-the-charts-in-their-own-language
2/5/2022,"Boris Johnson ends a bruising week with a vacuum at the heart of Downing Street and cabinet ministers beginning to distance themselves from his leadership. The loss of his communications director, Jack Doyle, his chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, and his policy chief, Munira Mirza, all in one day leaves the Tory party unsure who is now running the Johnson project in No 10, what its aims are and who will carry out their pursuit.  While the first three have notionally agreed to stay on until replacements are found, many MPs are beginning to doubt whether a team can be stitched together in time to stave off a confidence vote. With every day that passes, Tory MPs agree among themselves that Johnson’s premiership has an “end of days” feel to it – and yet the threshold of 54 letters signalling a loss of support in the prime minister has not been reached, leaving the party and government in a paralysed limbo. Johnson started the week with a schedule of announcements designed to overshadow the damaging revelations of the Sue Gray report and the Met police investigation into the Downing Street parties. A day trip to Ukraine was set up to make him look like an involved international leader, and there was the launch of his flagship policy on levelling up. MPs appeared temporarily boosted by the news that Sir Lynton Crosby, his elections guru, would be back giving him advice. But on closer inspection, each of these events only served to make him look weaker, as he ran shy of the press by taking just a Sun journalist with him to Kyiv, and failed to take the lead on the white paper, sending out the cabinet minister Michael Gove instead to do a statement and media interviews. It also became increasingly clear that Crosby’s involvement would be at arm’s length only. A bellicose performance at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday also triggered at least one of the resignations – that of policy chief Munira Mirza. Johnson slung out a slur against the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, falsely claiming he was responsible, when he was director of public prosecutions, for a failure to prosecute the serial child abuser Jimmy Savile. For all the furore around the parties, it is the prime minister’s flailing response and lack of contrition over the Savile slur that appears to have been the last straw for Mirza, along with some other MPs, such as Gary Streeter, who was one of at least five to put in letters of no confidence this week. And all the while, his cabinet ministers are watching from the sidelines, wondering whether the moment will come soon for a leadership contest. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor and the frontrunner to succeed Johnson, was the first to draw a line between himself and the beleaguered prime minister, saying he would not have made the Savile comment about Starmer. And then Sajid Javid, the health secretary, another possible rival, also laid down a marker that he did not approve of the remarks, saying Starmer as director of public prosecutions did a “good job and he should be respected for it”. Several of the cabinet – Liz Truss, Nadhim Zahawi and Grant Shapps – are in isolation with Covid, but the collective role of Johnson’s top team will become increasingly important in the days to come. Should Johnson manage to cobble together only a weak and insubstantial team over the weekend to replace his losses in No 10, then MPs may begin to lose the faith even before the conclusion of the Met police investigation and full publication of the Gray report. In this situation, they will increasingly be looking to the cabinet heavyweights and potential leadership challengers to give them the nod that now is the time to start submitting letters in droves. That moment has not yet come – but MPs and Downing Street are on tenterhooks.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s ministers watch and wonder as MPs sense the ‘end of days’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/boris-johnson-aides-departures-analysis
2/5/2022,"Andrew Bailey wants British workers to think again when they ask for an inflation-busting wage rise. “I’m not saying nobody gets a pay rise, don’t get me wrong, but I think, what I am saying, is we do need to see restraint in pay bargaining otherwise it will get out of control,” the Bank of England governor told BBC radio. With inflation already high and soaring skywards to more than 7%, Bailey was warning that Thursday’s increase in interest rates to 0.5% would be the first of many if workers did start a rush of demands for double-digit wage increases.  Such comments from someone who earns £495,000 a year were met with a hostile response from unions, while the PM’s spokesperson sought to distance No 10 from them. Summing up the general feeling, Unite boss Sharon Graham said: “Why is it that every time there is a crisis, rich men ask ordinary people to pay for it?” Yet this has not always been the trade union position when economists plead for help slow rising prices. In the three years after the 1974 election, unions pledged to do their bit to keep wages below inflation – just as now, when pay was soaring after an energy shock – as part of a social contract. But in 1977 unions abandoned the vow and have not made such a commitment since. In 1975, the first year of the deal, pay increases spiked at 29.4%, above the annual inflation rate of 25%, but in the two succeeding years, real wages fell. In contrast, wages growth without bonuses stood at 3.8% in November last year – the most recent month for which official figures are available. The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, which Bailey leads, estimates that pay growth rose a little higher last month to 4.5%. Bailey expects wage demands to increase dramatically from this level, after vacancies hit an all-time high of 1.1m and employment became “the first, second and third” item on the agenda of every employer he spoke to on trips round Britain. Bailey says his stance is backed by the Bank’s staff in regional offices, who take the temperature of local businesses. But while these chats may provide a useful guide, they are not definitive when the firms consulted are self-selecting and most likely members of their local chamber of commerce. They are not the down-at-heel, call centre businesses that pay rockbottom wages. Official statistics face the same problem. They ask questions of firms that tend to be better resourced and are prepared to fill in forms. Skill shortages caused by Brexit and the pandemic mean there are sectors where reports of rocketing salaries are a daily occurrence, such as the legal, accountancy and tech industries. At the other end of the pay scale, many hotels have gone from the national minimum wage in favour of something a little more generous. But these positive stories are offset by reports on the pay bargaining of millions of low and middle earners, which showed settlements last year increased from 2% to 2.5%. Such increases are unlikely to trouble those fearful of a 1970s-style wage-price spiral. Hours after Bailey made his plea, the Bank’s chief economist Huw Pill, revealed why the governor was so keen for workers to keep their wages in check. Pill said the central bank’s forecasts for inflation were based on wages remaining well below inflation. The fear is that “second-round effects” from higher wage demands would feed into future business costs, leading to still higher prices. So Bailey’s warning, however poorly received, was meant to work as an insurance policy, not a prediction. The Bank knows that with trade union membership at little over 6m and the gig economy employing millions, workers are emerging from the pandemic with strength in some areas, but not across the board and not enough to recreate the 1970s.",News/Business,Andrew Bailey’s wage restraint call is not a forecast of 1970s-style inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/04/andrew-baileys-wage-restraint-call-is-not-a-forecast-of-1970s-style-inflation
2/5/2022,"The National Trust has expressed surprise at plans to create a parliamentary group dedicated to them chaired by a Tory MP at the forefront of criticising the charity over issues such as a report into its properties’ connections to colonialism and slavery. While it is not unusual for all-party parliamentary groups to be dedicated to bodies such as the BBC, or have charities involved in their running, the trust said it was “unusual” for an “organisation-specific” APPG to emerge without that organisation’s knowledge or involvement.  The chair of the new APPG will be Andrew Murrison, who has boasted on his website of “leading the charge” against the trust and accused it of “tarnishing the reputation of Winston Churchill” in a report on the colonial history of its properties. A weekly circular emailed to MPs and peers to update them on all-party groups said the inaugural meeting of the APPG on the National Trust would take place next week. It stated that the group’s purpose “is to apply parliamentary scrutiny to the operational and strategic direction of the National Trust” and invited any MPs or peers wishing to join the meeting to contact Murrison’s office. “Sadly, we weren’t notified about the new group,” said a spokesperson for the trust, who questioned why the APPG was being set up, since a number of other APPGs already covered aspects of its work. As an independent charity, it is also regulated by the Charity Commission. “We don’t yet know what the new APPG will be used for, but like any charity, we’re always happy to engage in good faith with politicians who have an interest in our work. We would be happy to provide secretariat for the group, as is customary for organisation-specific APPGs.” The development comes on the back of a recent onslaught of criticism of the National Trust by MPs, sections of the Conservative press and Restore Trust, an insurgent group that has been waging a campaign against the perceived “wokeness” of the charity. Restore Trust (which has no connection to the Restore Trust, a Bristol-based non-profit) was set up after a report the charity published in 2020 showed the connections between 93 of its historic places with colonialism and slavery. Murrison, who has called for an independent review of the National Trust, secured a parliamentary adjournment debate on the charity’s future in 2020. The MP, whose South West Wiltshire constituency is home to one of the trust’s principal properties, Stourhead, has accused the trust of departing from its charitable purposes and seeking to “force the worldview of its leadership on the public”. He published a statement on his website in 2020 under the heading: “Andrew leads charge against National Trust.” It quoted him as saying: “The National Trust should be a politics-free space, a great mediating institution, not an organ for promulgating a particular worldview.” Murrison has been contacted for comment. Hilary McGrady, the charity’s director general, told the Guardian in January that she recognised that members and visitors had been “really cross and angry with us” over the issues raised by Restore Trust, which claimed to represent grassroots opposition to what it characterised as the trust’s “woke” agenda. But she added: “There were also people really delighted and relieved that we are finally looking at the history that they want to learn.”",News/UK news,Tory critical of National Trust to chair parliamentary group dedicated to charity,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/tory-mp-sets-up-all-party-group-on-national-trust-without-telling-charity
2/5/2022,"Such was the bewitching beauty of the ceremony that opened these XXIVth Winter Games in Beijing, it almost performed a trick on the mind. But as this two-hour show reached its spectacular denouement, and two young athletes bounded forward to light the Olympic flame, there proved to be a sharp sting in the tail. One of those performing the symbolic act was the Chinese cross-country skier Dinigeer Yilamujiang, who is of Uyghur heritage. That, to put it mildly, was a highly provocative act. Human rights organisations have branded these Olympics “the genocide games”, and accused China of holding a million Uyghurs against their will in re-education centres. China’s response told those groups it didn’t care, and these Games would be held on its terms.  Ironically, before then, the overwhelming message of the opening ceremony was all about peace. At one point placard holders of all 91 countries competing in Beijing came together to form a giant snowflake and symbolise all people living in harmony. At another, hundreds of young children danced and smiled and held white doves in the air as this spectacular show reached its denouement. In between, John Lennon’s Imagine played as speed skaters created harmonic images on the stage, and Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, called for an Olympic truce between warring nations. It was masterfully put together by the film director Zhang Yimou, who also directed the opening and closing ceremonies in 2008, and amounted to a sensuous tugging of the heartstrings. But it was also a mirage. For no amount of odes to peaceful coexistence can hide the fact that these Games will be the most controversial and difficult since Moscow in 1980. Perhaps even Berlin 1936. The fact that the US, Britain, Canada and others are staging a diplomatic boycott in protest at China’s human rights record is obviously a major factor. But the severe Covid restrictions, athletes in quarantine, the lack of real snow, and a shortage of spectators are significant too. On the eve of these Games, Bach had refused to be drawn on the repression of more than a million Uyghurs, insisting that the Games must stay politically neutral otherwise they would fracture and fall apart. No one, though, had passed the memo to China’s president, Xi Jinping. When Xi was introduced to the crowd of around 25,000 bussed-in spectators before the ceremony began, TV cameras captured him waving and accepting applause for longer than usual, as if he was accepting several encores before the Games had even started. Within the first 15 minutes, a Chinese flag was also passed through a crowd of people said to represent ethnic groups across the country, while soldiers carrying the flag were then seen marching across the stadium. When it comes to the Olympics, as Clausewitz almost said, sport is the continuation of politics by other means. Later, when Xi declared the Games open, the ferocious fireworks that followed sounded like a 21-gun salute. Officially this Winter Olympics is all about engaging 300 million Chinese people in winter sports, and also promoting – to quote Xi – “regional development, ecological conservation, green and innovative solutions and the betterment of people’s lives in China”. No one believes that. China is proud that Beijing is the first city to host both summer and winter Games, and over the next 17 days it will hammer the point home. As Cai Qi, the president of the organising committee, told the crowd: “Seven years ago we promised the world a joyous rendezvous on pure ice and snow, setting out a new Olympic journey. China is now writing a new chapter in the history of the Olympic movement. A long cherished dream is becoming a reality.” Meanwhile Bach – whose faith in the Olympics is such he probably believes it could turn water into wine – made the Games sound like an evangelical experience. “Over the next two weeks you will compete with each other for the highest prize,” he said. “At the same time, you will live peacefully together under one roof in the Olympic Village. There – there will be no discrimination for any reason whatsoever. “In our fragile world, where division, conflict and mistrust are on the rise, we show the world: yes, it is possible to be fierce rivals, while at the same time living peacefully and respectfully together. “This is the mission of the Olympic Games: bringing us together in peaceful competition. Always building bridges, never erecting walls. Uniting humankind in all our diversity.” Bach wasn’t finished there. Addressing a rogue’s gallery of leaders that included the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince accused of approving the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, he added: “In this Olympic spirit of peace, I appeal to all political authorities across the world: observe your commitment to this Olympic truce. Give peace a chance.” Earlier, when crowds arrived at the Bird’s Nest stadium they were handed hats and blankets to protect them from the freezing conditions, as well as mini Chinese flags. Plenty then waved them at the home team as they stepped out to the accompaniment of Ode to the Motherland, a communist anthem written in 1950. “Five-star red flags are fluttering in the wind,” it begins. “How clear and bright are the sounds of victory songs! Singing for our dear motherland, from now step towards prosperity and strength.” At one point the camera panned to a smiling Xi, who was no doubt satisfied with a job well done.",Sport/Sport,China opens Winter Olympics with peace doves and a mighty provocation,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/china-opens-winter-olympics-with-peace-doves-and-a-mighty-provocation
2/5/2022,"Anti-hate groups including the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, the Auschwitz Memorial and Hope Not Hate have condemned Jimmy Carr for his comments about the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller community in his Netflix special. The show, called His Dark Material, was released on Christmas Day but received widespread attention on Friday after a clip was posted and shared online.  Carr said: “When people talk about the Holocaust, they talk about the tragedy and horror of 6 million Jewish lives being lost to the Nazi war machine. But they never mention the thousands of Gypsies that were killed by the Nazis. “No one ever wants to talk about that, because no one ever wants to talk about the positives.” The statement prompted laughter and clapping from the audience. The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust – a charity founded by the government to support the UK’s national commemoration day – said on Friday that the jokes were “abhorrent”. Olivia Marks-Woldman, its chief executive, said: “We are absolutely appalled at Jimmy Carr’s comment about persecution suffered by Roma and Sinti people under Nazi oppression, and horrified that gales of laughter followed his remarks. “Hundreds of thousands of Roma and Sinti people suffered prejudice, slave labour, sterilisation and mass murder simply because of their identity – these are not experiences for mockery.” In the special, Carr, known for his standup and roles on shows such as 8 Out Of 10 Cats, went on to explain why he thought it was a good joke, saying that it was “fucking funny”, “edgy as hell” and had an educational value. “It’s a joke about the worst thing that’s ever happened in human history, and people say ‘never forget’, well this is how I remember,” he said. “There is an educational quality. Like everyone in the room knows 6 million Jewish people lost their lives to the Nazis during the second world war. But a lot of people don’t know, because it’s not really taught in our schools, that the Nazis also killed, in their thousands, Gypsies, homosexuals, disabled people and Jehovah’s Witnesses.” But his justifications did little to assuage the reaction. Hope Not Hate, the UK’s leading anti-fascism and anti-racism campaign group, said: “Comedy is an amazing tool for progressive change and it’s such a shame that Jimmy Carr decided to use his platform to celebrate the murder of one of the most marginalised groups in society.” The Auschwitz Memorial urged Carr to “learn about the fate of some 23 thousand Roma & Sinti deported to Auschwitz” in a tweet to its 1.2 million followers. Meanwhile, the Labour MP Nadia Whittome wrote to Netflix urging the company to remove the material from its platform. She said she had also requested an update from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on progress to bring streaming platforms under Ofcom regulation. I have written urging Netflix to remove Jimmy Carr’s vile anti-GRT and antisemitic material.I have also requested an update from @DCMS on progress to bring streaming platforms under Ofcom regulation.My full solidarity with GRT communities, today and always. pic.twitter.com/We6MRJVyjb “In funding, streaming and profiting from this material, Netflix is legitimising and perpetuating racism,” Whittome wrote in her letter. “Material of the kind on your platform does not exist in isolation and it has real-life consequences.” It will be an unwelcome row for Netflix, which last year faced an intense backlash and a staff walkout after comments made by Dave Chappelle about transgender people in his comedy special. Mikey Walsh, the author of the bestselling memoir Gypsy Boy, tweeted that he didn’t know what he should be more “disgusted” by, “the kind of Racism that us GRT people are forced to live with every day … that it’s still absolutely ok to demonise us & our demise as a joke … or the reactions of whooping and cheering from the audience”. Absolutely zero accountability will come from this..we as Travellers, Roma & Gypsies in the UK know full well that hatred towards us is seen as a good thing.Ever seen one of the many GRT racists in Parliament ever held accountable?That’s because GRT Racism Is a vote winner here Netflix and representatives of Carr have been contacted for comment.",Arts/Culture,Jimmy Carr condemned for ‘abhorrent’ Holocaust joke about Roma people,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/04/jimmy-carr-condemned-for-joke-about-gypsies-in-netflix-special
2/5/2022,"No one asked for generosity – only justice. Self-interest as well as decency should have encouraged fairer distribution of vaccines: no one is safe until everyone is safe. Yet two years into the pandemic, with 8,400 people dying each day, the prospect of anything approaching vaccine equity remains as remote as ever. More boosters have been delivered in the developed world than first and second doses in low-income countries – the places that can least afford other measures such as restrictions on movements. In high-income countries more than two in three people have received at least one dose, but in low-income countries only one in nine. As of November, only one in four African healthworkers was fully vaccinated. “What we understood to be equitable treatment is not the way rich nations looked at it. [To them] it means: we get [them] first, and when we are done with saving our own people, we will then attend to you,” observed Strive Masiyiwa, African Union special envoy on Covid-19, and head of the African vaccine acquisition task team.  Covax, the vaccine-pooling scheme, hoped to deliver 2bn shots by the end of last year. It has only provided half that, and recently warned that it cannot accept more donations of doses, because it lacks the cash to buy syringes. Wealthier nations should provide funding now. But a deeper rethink is needed. The Omicron wave has highlighted the risk posed to everyone by variants. New ones could prove more lethal. Poorer nations are also thinking about the next pandemic; Covid-19 has been a painful lesson. Richer nations have engaged in vaccine nationalism – hoarding doses (in some cases, later thrown away unused) so that the African Union was unable to buy anything with the $2bn it had in hand. They have taken up vaccine diplomacy: campaigners recently pointed out that Australia had distributed 18m doses to neighbouring countries, but committed not one to Covax. Put under pressure, they have pledged donations but delivered only small portions of them, and dumped nearly expired doses – so developing countries are unable to use them in time. Covax alone cannot fix this. Médecins Sans Frontières recently warned that, for all its good intentions, the scheme has fundamental flaws, including a failure to involve governments and civil society from lower-income countries, and its commitment to a global health model that considers protecting the intellectual property of pharmaceutical firms to be essential. It also counted on Indian production for African needs. When the Delta variant hit India, and its government imposed an export ban, Africa was left without even the inadequate supply it had been promised. The lesson, says Mr Masiyiwa, is that those with production assets are the ones who can vaccinate their people. National leaders will not prioritise another population over their own; realistic plans must treat vaccine nationalism as a given. There has been some progress: Pfizer’s partner, BioNTec, is building Covid vaccine manufacturing plants in Rwanda and Senegal. South Africa has made its own version of the Moderna vaccine. But this can be only a start. With discussions beginning on a global pandemic response accord, there is growing demand for a requirement for knowledge to be shared in future outbreaks. That will unquestionably face intense pushback from pharmaceutical businesses and their supporters. But patent waivers – backed by the US, but still opposed by the UK and EU – and technology transfer should begin now. Poorer countries can wait no longer.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on vaccine justice: the developing world won’t wait | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/the-guardian-view-on-vaccine-justice-the-developing-world-wont-wait
2/5/2022,"The Democratic Unionist party pulled the plug on post-Brexit Irish Sea border checks this week and then resigned its joint leadership of Northern Ireland’s power-sharing executive. These were dramatic gestures. They are a reminder of the chronic instability that has continued to dog Northern Ireland governance, in spite of the Good Friday agreement. They are also a reminder of the particularly destabilising effects of Brexit for Ireland as a whole. But they are, above all, a sign of DUP political weakness, not strength. They are a foolish gamble that the DUP can get its way in a Brexit argument to which compromise is, in the long run, the only solution. In the short term, however, the DUP’s action has been provoked by electoral fear. An assembly election is due in Northern Ireland in three months’ time. The DUP’s positions as both the dominant unionist party and as the largest party in the assembly are under threat amid the anxieties triggered by Brexit. The party has been losing support to more moderate and more fundamentalist rivals alike.  All this has fuelled, and has been intensified by, bitter internal clashes. These led to the removal of Arlene Foster as party leader last May, and then of her successor Edwin Poots a month later, when he was replaced in turn by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. Splits inside the DUP and within unionism are helping to provide an electoral gift to Sinn Féin, which may be poised to become the largest party, with the right to nominate the new first minister. This instability is fuelled by the Brexit settlement, under which a trade barrier in the Irish Sea was conceded by Boris Johnson as the price of maintaining a soft border between north and south. The DUP supported Brexit in 2016 but has proved incapable of dealing with its consequences. Sir Jeffrey came to power with a reputation as a DUP politician whom others could do business with. Early on, he talked of removing the flaws of the Northern Ireland protocol. But hostility to the protocol has increasingly become a litmus test of hardline unionist identity. Nowadays, Sir Jeffrey talks only of scrapping it. The party is now gambling that a more intransigent stance will restore its ascendancy among unionist voters and within Northern Ireland politics more widely. This is why Mr Poots, as agriculture minister, ordered the border checks to cease (a court stayed his decision on Friday) and why Paul Givan quit as first minister the next day (though other DUP ministers remain in place for the time being). It is possible that such stunts will prove a vote-winner when the election comes. But they also imply that power-sharing will not be resuming any time soon, before or after the vote. The DUP’s actions are not designed to make a settlement of the protocol dispute any more likely. The UK and the EU may nevertheless be edging slowly towards finding a solution to their differences. Any such settlement would clearly fall far short of the scrapping of the protocol that the DUP is demanding. But the DUP is out of step with majority opinion in Northern Ireland on Brexit – and always has been. Mr Johnson should not give in to its threats. Instead, he should reach a sensible compromise with the EU of the kind that the majority in Northern Ireland have shown they would be likely to support.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the DUP: signs of weakness and woe | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-dup-signs-of-weakness-and-woe
2/5/2022,"Michael Gove ignored repeated warnings that the “Trojan horse” allegations of an extremist takeover of schools in Birmingham was “bogus” and pressed ahead with divisive interventions, according to evidence revealed in a New York Times podcast. A briefing by Birmingham city council in February 2014 for Gove, then education secretary, said it had found “a serious credibility gap” regarding the anonymous letter, saying it contained “serious factual inaccuracies and, in a number of areas, contradictions” in allegations of an Islamist plot to subvert state schools in the city.  The evidence collected by Hamza Syed and Brian Reed, two journalists working on the podcast, reignites the controversy surrounding the alleged plot, which triggered a series of raids, takeovers and turmoil in schools in central Birmingham with high proportions of Muslim pupils. But despite investigations by the government, Ofsted and Birmingham council – including one by Peter Clarke, a former national head of counter-terrorism, commissioned by Gove – the origins of the letter have never been discovered, and little or no evidence of a concerted plot or radicalisation of pupils was ever established. The eight-part podcast, The Trojan Horse Affair, said Gove was also told that Birmingham city council’s independent auditors had investigated allegations against schools named in the Trojan horse letter. According to the briefing given to Gove, the audit “had come to a clear view there was no basis” for the allegations. Sir Albert Bore, the leader of Birmingham local authority at the time, supplied the journalists with notes of his meeting with Gove on 12 February 2014, before the Trojan horse letter had reached the national media. The notes show that Gove was told that the recommendation of the West Midlands police, including its counter-terrorism unit, was that the letter was “bogus”. However, the letter circulated within Whitehall became a flashpoint between Gove and Theresa May, the then home secretary, who privately berated Gove for failing to act. Shortly afterwards, the letter reached the national media, at a time when fears of British Muslims travelling to fight alongside Islamic State in Iraq and Syria were high. Asked to respond, a government spokesperson said: “We make no apology for working to protect young people from all forms of harm. All children, from whatever background and no matter what challenges they face, deserve a safe environment in which they can learn. “The Trojan horse investigation led by Peter Clarke rightly focused on whether the events and behaviours that were alleged actually happened, and the findings have subsequently been confirmed by a number of independent reports.” A high-profile disciplinary hearing against senior leaders at one school, Park View, collapsed after flaws were exposed in the government’s legal handling, costing the Department for Education hundreds of thousands of pounds in fees. The podcast’s journalists also obtained a copy of Birmingham city council’s audit report into events at Adderley primary school in Saltley, Birmingham, which is covered in great detail in the Trojan horse letter. The independent auditors investigated an employment dispute between four teaching assistants and the head of Adderley school, Rizvana Darr, including claims by teaching assistants that resignation letters in their names accepted by the school had been forged. Concerns over the tribunal and the council’s investigation led to a rift between Adderley school and the council. But after the Trojan horse letter emerged, Birmingham council officially retracted the audit report and restored its backing to Adderley’s legal defence. Birmingham city council also threatened the podcast journalists with an injunction if they used or published the independent audit report. The podcast concludes without any firm evidence of the Trojan horse letter’s author or origin, but says the timing of the letter’s appearance coincides with the legal difficulties between the council and Adderley school – suggesting it may have been intended to influence the employment tribunal. A Birmingham city council (BCC) spokesperson said: “It is important to remember that amid all the speculation, commentary and debate, there were investigations to get to the heart of the matter by both BCC and government. As a result we took steps to address any concerns raised and as a city we have moved on, while ensuring we learned from these experiences. “The diversity of this city is one of its strengths and we must celebrate it, but we must also continue to work hard to strengthen our community cohesion and ensure communities don’t feel isolated. We have done a lot of work to engage with communities and stakeholders and to nurture a sense of belonging and togetherness for all who live and work in the city.” Michael Gove was also contacted for comment.",News/Politics,Gove acted on ‘bogus’ allegations of Islamist plot to take over Birmingham schools,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/michael-gove-acted-on-bogus-allegations-of-islamist-plot-to-take-over-birmingham-schools
2/5/2022,"Mark Zuckerberg’s virtual reality business is to introduce a mandatory distance between people’s digital avatars after warnings that the social media tycoon’s plans for a metaverse will lead to a new wave of online harassment. Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, is making a multibillion-dollar bet on VR as the next source of growth for his empire but his strategy has already been dogged by warnings that virtual worlds are rife with abuse.  In December a user testing Horizon Worlds, a VR app owned by Zuckberg’s Meta business, complained of being groped online and called for a protective bubble around their avatar, or digital representation of themselves. “Sexual harassment is no joke on the regular internet but being in VR adds another layer that makes the event more intense,” said the user. Meta announced on Friday that it is introducing personal boundaries on two VR apps: Horizon Worlds, where people can meet fellow VR users and design their own world; and Horizon Venues, which hosts VR events such as comedy shows or music gigs. The company said the distance between people will be the VR equivalent of four feet. “A personal boundary prevents anyone from invading your avatar’s personal space. If someone tries to enter your personal boundary, the system will halt their forward movement as they reach the boundary,” said the company. Meta is introducing the 4ft boundary as a default setting and will consider further changes such as letting people set their own boundaries. “We think this will help to set behavioural norms – and that’s important for a relatively new medium like VR,” said Meta. The UK data watchdog has also said it is seeking clarification from Meta about parental controls on the company’s popular Oculus Quest 2 VR headset, as campaigners warned that it could breach an online children’s safety code. The Information Commissioner’s Office said it would talk to Meta after research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a campaign group, flagged multiple instances of abuse on VRChat, a top-selling social app for Oculus headset users. Zuckerberg renamed his company from Facebook Inc to Meta last year in a signal that the future of his business lies in the metaverse, a concept where the physical and digital worlds combine via virtual and augmented reality. Although the notion of a fully fledged metaverse is many years away, Meta already announced a $50m (£37m) investment programme to ensure the concept meets regulatory and legal concerns, distributing the money among organisations and academic institutions such as Seoul National University and Women in Immersive Tech.",News/Technology,Meta to bring in mandatory distances between virtual reality avatars,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/04/meta-to-bring-in-mandatory-distances-between-virtual-reality-avatars
2/5/2022,"The former fiance of the late television presenter Caroline Flack has been jailed for a campaign of harassment against the journalist Dan Wootton. The judge, Jeremy Richardson QC, said Andrew Brady’s claims that the former executive editor of the Sun newspaper was in some way responsible for Flack’s death were “wholly irrational”.  Brady, 31, from Sheffield, was jailed for four months after admitting harassment at a hearing this week. Richardson told Brady at Sheffield crown court that his social media attacks on Wootton, a MailOnline columnist and GB News presenter, had “everything to do with your craving for celebrity status and your irritation that the press were not in the least interested in your somewhat uninteresting life”. “This must stop,” the judge added. He said Wootton was a friend of the Love Island presenter, who died in February 2020, aged 40. Richardson noted that, given the time the defendant had served on remand, he would be released in the “very near future”. He imposed a 10-year restraining order banning Brady from contacting Wootton, posting anything about him online or going within 200 yards of his home or workplace. Describing some of the social media posts and messages about Wootton as “utterly outrageous”, Richardson warned Brady he faced a prison sentence measured in years if he breached the order. Last August, an inquest ruled that Flack killed herself after learning she would be prosecuted for allegedly assaulting her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, after a long struggle with “fluctuating mental health” that was exacerbated by the stress of fame.

2/5/2022,"My father-in-law, Abdul Quddus, who has died aged 80, was for many years a senior education officer at Leeds city council. He and his wife, Parveen, were also social entrepreneurs, setting up secular organisations that focused on enabling all communities to participate fully in the city’s social, cultural and civic life. During the 1980s and 90s, communities in Leeds originating from south-east Asia still had poor educational and work outcomes, with high unemployment and low-skilled jobs. Abdul worked to address that by securing government funding for and setting up Bangladeshi, Pakistani and other centres in the city, run by members of those communities and helping them access adult education, welfare and housing support. The centres were non-religious, with equal rights and responsibilities for women and young people.  Abdul and Parveen also helped to set up voluntary and community organisations such as the Bengali cultural society Purobi, a women’s empowerment project, Asha, and a Bengali language school for children. Born in Pabna, Bangladesh, Abdul was the son of Nurul Islam and Halima Nur. After school he gained a BA from the Agriculture College in Dhaka (1964), then a master’s (1968) from Mymensingh Agricultural University (now called Bangladesh Agricultural University). He married Parveen Akhtar in 1972, and they travelled to Leeds that year. He obtained an MA in economics from Leeds University in 1973, with a focus on rural economics of developing countries. While working towards a PhD he volunteered at Leeds Citizens Advice Bureau, leading to a job as an education officer at Leeds city council, from 1983, rising to senior education officer. As well as the usual duties he worked on specific projects to support those newly arrived from south-east Asia. In 1988 he created 40 teaching assistant posts for members of those communities so that parents could better support their children in school. He also helped to appoint a number of black and minority ethnic headteachers in Leeds. Thanks to his work, today many people of Bangladeshi descent living in Leeds are in professional jobs, in academia or successful entrepreneurs. Abdul also ensured more individuals from Bame communities gained the relevant qualifications to take up youth worker and education jobs in the council. After retiring in 1999, he undertook consultancy work on mentoring projects for disadvantaged young people. This was funded through the EU, and he travelled to a number of European countries, including Hungary, Greece and Norway. A humanist, Abdul loved Bengali classical music and poetry, and the writings of Rabindranath Tagore. He and Parveen would appear in Bengali plays through the Purobi cultural society. A role model for young people, Abdul would cite the words of Barack Obama “Don’t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope.” Abdul is survived by Parveen, their daughter, Archi, and grandson, Sobitha.

2/5/2022,"The US economy appeared to shake off the Omicron variant in January as employers added 467,000 new jobs, the labor department reported on Friday. Data for the report was collected in mid-January when the Omicron variant was at its peak in the US. While some economists – and the White House – had predicted a dramatic slump in jobs growth, the number of jobs added was far better than expected.  The unemployment rate remained low overall at 4%, down from a pandemic high of 14.8% in April 2020 but up from 3.9% in December. The news comes at a sensitive time for the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve. The US economy is wrestling with soaring inflation and signs of an economic slowdown after last year’s strong rebound. Joe Biden celebrated the jobs news in a speech in Washington. “America is back to work,” Biden said. “History’s been made here.” His comments were in stark contrast to those made by White House officials earlier in the week. In a highly unusual move, the White House sought to manage expectations ahead of the latest jobs figure release, cautioning that Friday’s jobs report could be “confusing” because of the timing of the survey and suggesting that the US would add few or even lose jobs in January. Covid infections have fallen sharply across the US since the report was compiled. The government report follows on from a survey conducted by ADP, the US’s largest private payroll supplier, which reported that companies cut jobs in January for the first time in more than a year. Payrolls fell by 301,000 for the month with more than half the losses coming from the pandemic-sensitive leisure and hospitality industries. “The labor market recovery took a step back at the start of 2022 due to the effect of the Omicron variant and its significant, though likely temporary, impact to job growth,” said Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist. There were signs that the jobs market is still recovering ahead of Friday’s report. On Thursday, the labor department reported that new unemployment claims fell to 238,000 for the final week in January, dropping 23,000 from the week prior, a second straight week of falls.",News/Business,US appears to shake off Omicron and adds nearly half a million January jobs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/04/us-jobs-figures-january-omicron-covid
2/5/2022,"Police have arrested the suspect in a violent altercation that badly injured a San Francisco 49ers fan after last weekend’s NFC championship game between the 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams at LA’s SoFi stadium. Inglewood police lieutenant Nicole Loudermilk confirmed that the suspect was taken into custody Thursday night, but released no further details.  The incident occurred on Sunday during a confrontation in the parking lot of the stadium after the NFC championship game between the Rams and the 49ers, and raised concerns about security at the upcoming Super Bowl to be played at SoFi next week. One man injured in the fight, 40-year-old Daniel Luna, remained in a medically induced coma, California officials had said Thursday. James T Butts Jr, the Inglewood mayor, said that video of the incident showed Luna mingling in a crowd of about 16 people at SoFi stadium, most of them wearing what appeared to be 49ers jerseys, when he pushed a man wearing a Rams jersey from behind, Butts said. Before that, Butts said, “there didn’t seem to be any hostilities”. When Luna turned to walk away, the man pushed Luna back, the mayor said. When Luna turned, the man punched him in the mouth, causing Luna to fall to the ground and hit the back of his head, Butts said, estimating that the encounter lasted less than five seconds. “It looked like a small altercation that went very bad,” he said. “From one punch and someone falling, hitting their head on the ground. It wasn’t like you had people ganging up on somebody and beating them.” Luna’s face was fractured and he was placed in a medically induced coma to prevent internal bleeding from swelling his brain, Butts said. The mayor said the video isn’t clear enough to provide a description of the suspect but he was seen talking to some people in a car. Police want to find the car and talk to the occupants to see if they were involved, Butts said. Security won’t be increased because of the incident, the mayor said. “I’m very comfortable there was sufficient security” in the parking lot, he said. “There is plenty of security in the parking lot. You’re not going to stop every altercation, argument between fans. It’s just not going to happen.“ Next week, the Rams will welcome the Cincinnati Bengals for Super Bowl 56 at the SoFi stadium.",News/US news,Suspect arrested after violence outside LA’s SoFi Stadium left man in coma ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/49ers-fan-medically-induced-coma
