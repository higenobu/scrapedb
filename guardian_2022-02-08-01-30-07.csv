2/8/2022,"A man who was paralysed in a motorcycle accident in 2017 has regained the ability to walk after doctors implanted electrodes in his spine to reactivate his muscles. Michel Roccati lost all feeling and movement in his legs after the crash that severed his spinal cord, but can stand and walk with electrical stimulation that is controlled wirelessly from a tablet.  The research team said the electrical implant had helped Roccati and two other patients – all men aged 29 to 41 – to stand, walk, ride a bike and even kick their legs in a swimming pool, raising hopes that small, implantable devices can help paralysed people regain more independence. Rocatti now uses the device as part of his routine training and rehabilitation to help strengthen his muscles and keep fit. “Now it’s a part of my daily life,” he said. Developed by Prof Grégoire Courtine, a neuroscientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, and Prof Jocelyne Bloch, a neurosurgeon at Lausanne university hospital, the system uses a soft, flexible electrode that is laid on top of the spinal cord nerves, underneath the vertebrae. The electrode delivers electrical pulses to spinal cord nerves that control different muscles in the legs and torso. The pulses, in turn, are controlled by software on a tablet that issues instructions for a certain action, such as standing, walking, cycling, or kicking the legs for swimming. The device helped all three patients to stand within hours of the operation, but their performance improved with three to four months of practice and training. “It was not perfect at the beginning, but they could train very early to have a more fluid gait,” said Bloch. She added that she expected similar results in women. “Thanks to this technology, we’ve been able to target individuals with the most serious spinal cord injuries,” Courtine said. “By controlling these implants, we can activate the spinal cord like the brain would do naturally to have the patient stand, walk, swim or ride a bike.” The patients are following a training programme that has let them rebuild lost muscle and move around more independently, even allowing them to stand and drink in a bar. To perform a particular movement, the person selects the appropriate option from their tablet. The tablet then contacts a pacemaker-like device in their abdomen that sends signals to the implanted electrode. This stimulates the different sets of muscles for the right time and duration to push up into a standing position, or swing the legs to walk, for example. Details of the system are reported in Nature Medicine.",News/Science,Paralysed man walks again thanks to electrodes in his spine,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/07/paralysed-man-walks-again-thanks-to-electrodes-in-his-spine
2/8/2022,"The mutual insurer LV= has launched a boardroom clear-out following the high-profile failure of its management to sell the company to a US private equity firm last year. The 197-year old firm, which failed in December to win enough support from its members for a plan to sell itself to Bain Capital, said its chairman would step down from the start of April, while three other directors would also leave.  Alan Cook, who had faced heavy criticism over the demutualisation plan, will be replaced by Seamus Creedon on an interim basis. He is a non-executive director at the firm and will lead the process to reshape the board. The company confirmed that talks with its fellow mutual insurer Royal London had been reopened following the failure of the Bain Capital deal, reigniting a process that supporters of keeping LV= in mutual ownership said could have offered a better solution than selling to a private equity firm. LV= said three other non-executives would also leave as it reshapes the board, including David Barral, who will depart after reaching the end of his six-year term on 7 March, while Alison Hutchinson and Luke Savage will also step down. Hutchinson had faced criticism for sitting on the board of the member-owned Yorkshire Building Society at the same time as backing the demutualisation of LV=. However, LV= said its chief executive, Mark Hartigan, who had faced stiff criticism over the Bain Capital plan, would remain with the company. Creedon said Hartigan had been doing an excellent job of running the insurer. “The board takes full responsibility for the unsuccessful transaction, which Mark actively advocated on its behalf, and my colleagues and I have high confidence in him and his team,” he said. Creedon said the firm had common interests with Royal London in promoting a healthy and vibrant mutual sector. “We felt it right to take time to understand the message members gave the board. Put simply, our members told us that what they viewed as the modest financial advantages of the transaction were not worth the loss of ownership and voting rights for our million-plus members,” he added. Gareth Thomas, the Labour and Co-operative MP who chairs the all party parliamentary group for mutuals, said he hoped LV= would now be more open with its members about the risks and benefits in their talks with Royal London. He said: “After LV=’s dismal and thankfully unsuccessful attempt to demutualise and sell up to the controversial US private equity giant Bain Capital, it’s good to see the board have heard their members’ message and are now committed to a mutual future.”",News/Business,LV= chairman to step down after failure of sale to US firm,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/07/alan-cook-lv-chairman-step-down-failure-sale-us-firm-bain-capital
2/8/2022,"This dull, stilted, suspense drama is not to be confused with either the excellent TV series of the same name starring Stephen Graham and Jodie Comer, or the Beatles’ larky 1965 collaboration with director Richard Lester (same title, but with extra punctuation). Perhaps this Help’s writer-director, Blake Ridder, and his producers were hoping that folks surfing streaming platforms might click on their production thinking it was either of these two far superior entertainments. Accidental viewers are not likely to stick with this unless they really want to know what happens to three or so thinly drawn characters locked in a psychodrama of suspicion, betrayal and unconvincingly faked lust.  Having just split up with her long-distance lover, Grace (Emily Redpath) comes to visit her old friend Liv (Sarah Alexandra Marks) and partner Edward (Louis James) in the countryside. A neighbour, David (played by Ridder himself), who appears to either be autistic or have another neurodivergent condition, warns Grace enigmatically as she arrives that “it’s bad”. This, presumably, applies to Liv and Edward’s tempestuous relationship but could just as easily be a judgment on the film itself. Gradually, Grace realises that there is violence happening behind closed doors, but the big twist reveals that things are not as they seem. While we wouldn’t want to spoil the surprise, we can’t let it pass that the reveal is predicated on a very dodgy understanding of a particular type of domestic violence. This is Ridder’s first full-length feature after having made dozens of shorts (according to IMDB), on many of which he is credited as cinematographer, editor, producer and actor as well as writer-director. You would think after all that practice, this step-up to feature making would be a bit better. The biggest problem, apart from the turgid pace and confused screenwriting, is directing actors: the cast perform with the wooden, inert energy of hostages making a proof-of-life video. Worst of all, a cute jack russell terrier named Polly gets accidentally offed. Some cinematic crimes are unforgivable.  Help is released on 14 February on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Help review – dizzying psychodrama that gets domestic violence all wrong,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/help-review-a-dizzyingly-dismal-psychodrama-blake-ridder
2/8/2022,"Lata Mangeshkar, “the nightingale of Bollywood”, who has died aged 92 after contracting Covid-19, was a much-loved Indian national and international figure, whose songs provided the backdrop to the lives of millions for seven decades. Music sung by her was heard constantly across India, in shops, restaurants, taxis or on the radio, and she became known as “Didi”, or sister, because so many people identified with her often emotional songs. And yet she was best known as a playback singer, a vocalist who does not appear onscreen but provides the soundtrack for films in which actors lip sync to her singing.  Her output was extraordinary – she is estimated to have recorded some 25,000 songs, which appeared in more than a 1,000 Hindi films, and she also sang in more than 20 different Indian languages. With an impressive vocal range, covering four octaves, she became massively popular with film directors for her ability to understand the context in which her songs would be used. Mangeshkar did not just sing, but made sure that her performance matched the storyline and the character, saying that she always read the lyrics and listened to the tune before agreeing to sing. She first came to national fame in India with the song Aayega Aanewala (meaning “the one who is destined to come will definitely come”), which she recorded in 1949 while still a teenager. A charming and dramatic song, which featured in the film Mahal that year, it was the start of a remarkable career in which she interpreted work by all the major Indian film composers. For more than three decades she recorded hundreds of songs by the composing duo of Laxmikant-Pyarelal (Laxmikant Shantaram Kudalkar and Pyarelal Ramprasad Sharma), including such hits as Sheesha Ho Ya Dil Ho (from the film Aasha, in 1980). She also worked with SD Burman, and later with his celebrated son the composer RD Burman (who would marry her sister Asha), recording RD Burman songs including Bahon Mein Chale Aao (from the film Anamica, 1973). Later she collaborated with the most internationally celebrated Bollywood composer, AR Rahman, and sang several of his best known songs including Jiya Jale (from the 1998 romantic thriller Dil Se) and Luka Chuppi (from the 2006 film Rang De Basanti), which she recorded when she was in her mid-70s. Rahman remembered how carefully she would rehearse: “She would sit with her assistant, and would start singing very slowly, with every lyric clear.” She was, he said, “part of a soul, part of a consciousness of India”. If she had any competition as India’s finest playback singer, it was from her younger sister Asha Bhosle. After all, it was Asha who had Cornershop’s 1997 hit Brimful of Asha written about her, and who had recorded the most number of songs (according to The Guinness Book of World Records Lata was ahead in 1974 but Asha overtook her), and it was Asha who recorded with the experimental Kronos Quartet. Lata insisted there was no sibling rivalry, saying; “we’re very close, we never competed with each other.” Mangeshkar was born in Indore, in what is now Madhya Pradesh state, the oldest child of Shevanti (later renamed Shuddhamati) and Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar, a musician and teacher who ran a touring theatre company. Lata never went to school, as she quit on the first day when the teacher refused to allow her to bring her then 10-month-old sister Asha into the classroom. Much of her childhood was spent singing alongside her father at concerts. He died in 1942, when she was 13, and she then had to support her mother and four siblings. A close family friend, Vinayak Damodar Karnataki, offered her work with his film company Navyug Chitrapat, acting in minor roles. When the company moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1945, she and her family moved with them. She said she disliked acting “because I was very small and hated putting on makeup and having to laugh and cry in front of the cameras”. But she loved playback singing, and was given her first break with a song in the film Majboor (1948). Then came the film Mahal, which included her hit song, and she rapidly became known as India’s Playback Queen. Though most celebrated for her film work, she also gave concerts in India and abroad. In 1963, shortly after the Sino-Indian war, she sang the patriotic Hindi song Aye Mere Watan Ke Logon (“Oh people of my country”) to an audience including Jawaharlal Nehru, the prime minister, who is said to have been moved to tears. In 1974 she performed many of her Bollywood hits at the Royal Albert Hall in London, backed by musicians including SD Burman, and was hailed as the first Indian artist to have performed there. Away from music, her passions included fast cars and cricket – she would insist on taking time off to watch matches. The former Indian captain Virat Kohli was among those who paid tribute to her, as did Imran Khan, another leading cricketer and now Pakistan’s prime minister. He wrote that “the subcontinent has lost one of the truly great voices the world has known” – a reminder that she had a vast following beyond India’s borders. Mangeshkar may have recorded thousands of emotional love songs, but she never married. Asked about her private life by the Hindustan Times, she said, “there are some things only for the heart to know. Let’s keep it that way.” In 2001 she received India’s highest honour for civilians, the Bharat Ratna. She is survived by her younger siblings Meena, Asha, Usha and Hridaynath, all of whom are singers or composers.

2/8/2022,"With just a few words, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, perfectly crystallised the state and the fate of the nation. Tone-deaf and socially oblivious, the voice booming out from the economic seat of power captured the history of the last lost decade. “We do need to see restraint in pay bargaining, otherwise it will get out of control,” Bailey told the BBC last week. As wages continue to fall, inflation is set to hit 7.25% in a couple of months, while pay will rise by far less. TUC leaders protest that “workers have been hammered and now they’re coming back for more.” “This is a very tough message to swallow when take-home pay is falling,” the Institute for Fiscal Studies director, Paul Johnson, tells me, pointing to a decade of lost pay – the longest period of pay stagnation in many years.  The governor’s Marie Antoinette insouciance struck a wearily familiar chord. This authentic voice of social negligence has made the British economy one of the most unequal and unproductive among its European equivalents. Pre-pandemic, real wage growth in the UK became the weakest among the advanced nations in the G20. The prime minister and chancellor brag of the “fastest growth in the G7”, but only as we climb out of the deepest slump. When the governor says “we do need to see a moderation of wage rises”, he ignores his own prediction of falling incomes. “Why wages? Why didn’t he call for profits to be squeezed?” Torsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation asks with a rhetorical flourish. He tells me: “The big picture is that wages have been rubbish the whole decade, while productivity plummeted after 2016 due to Brexit uncertainty.” The governor’s destructive interest rate rises are a doomed response to global price inflation that lies beyond the Bank’s control. This kneejerk call to cut pay is just a natural banker’s reflex. A silent class war has taken place during the past decade, as the winners have carried off undreamed-of booty. Thanks mostly to the Bank’s quantitative easing which inflated assets, not productive investment, the decade created billionaires, whose wealth rose by 310% according to The Decade the Rich Won, a new documentary on BBC Two. There were no such calls for a modicum of “restraint” from those whose wealth ballooned after the financial crisis. Quantitative easing gifted such a vast asset bonanza to the already wealthy that it astounded even the English financier Guy Hands. “Those of us in private equity got incredibly wealthy. The effect was the rich got richer,” he told the BBC. Was he grateful? He removed himself and his company, Terra Firma, to shelter in Guernsey. This is the great levelling down: pay and homeownership is falling. Over the past decade, property prices have risen by around 60%. Public sector pay has been hit the hardest, falling 2.4% just in the year to November, says the IFS, despite Boris Johnson proclaiming the pay freeze to be over. Local government workers’ annual salaries are down by £1,600, with teachers 8% behind on their 2010 salaries, according to the TUC. Falling pay isn’t just about hungry families relying on food banks. It damages public services, too. In the NHS, with its impossible waiting list, nurses’ pay is already down by £2,700 a year. I talked to Ella, a highly specialised neurosurgery nurse, precious to the NHS; but she has just left, sad to go. She was paid £29,000 – around the national median – but now she earns more than £41,000 in a private hospital. It’s not just the money: in her NHS section there were 12 staff vacancies, and she alone cared for eight very sick patients. “It gives you nightmares and panic attacks that you’ll make mistakes. You do bank shifts to make up the pay and it’s very, very hard.” Now she cares for four patients with a senior nurse supervisor, in a department with no vacancies: nine other experienced nurses left her NHS hospital with her. “If they had the staff, if the work was manageable, if the pay was enough without overtime, none of us would leave the NHS.” Her story is a warning: an underfunded NHS that underpays and understaffs will break the health service if the contrast with private health grows too great. The governor’s spectre of wages rising “out of control” was greeted with such indignation that No 10 slapped him down, the prime minister desperately seeking popularity. However, the austerian chancellor’s silence was widely taken as approval for Bailey’s stance. His trope summons up scary 1970s folk myths, in which unions were blamed for striving to keep up with mushrooming inflation. In 1974, Labour forged a social contract to curb inflation by holding down prices if unions held back wage demands. It fell apart when wages still fell below prices. Nowadays the governor offers nothing in exchange for pay “restraint”, a sign of how weak unions have become. They are virtually absent in a private sector where an insecure, atomised workforce faces “fire and rehire” and temporary contract threats. Only a few niches, such as HGV drivers, gain anything from current labour shortages. Though unions are stronger in the public sector, pay is hardly “out of control” there. While nurses and teachers feel the moral arm-twisting of caring for their patients and pupils, the comparatively good pay of train drivers proves the value of flexing union muscles. Meanwhile, as Johnson woos his rightwing MPs by ditching any “lefty” policies, the government’s promised employment bill – which was supposed to ease the worst of gig economy brutality – has vanished. Expect no aspirant for Johnson’s job to to pay injustice. The one hope for wages, says the TUC, is a Labour government implementing Rachel Reeves’ pledge for fair pay agreements across every sector. Labour would end zero-hours contracts and bogus self-employment, with guaranteed access to a union and employee working rights from day one. Until that day, the boot is on the banker’s foot.

The setter’s name often links to an interview with him or her, in case you feel like getting to know these people better.  At prime minister’s questions last week, the prime minister gave a strong whiff of “you’re not still angry – I thought we’d agreed we were past that”. He would be advised not to turn to crosswords for escape.

Here’s a clue from Pasquale in the quiptic, the Guardian’s puzzle “for beginners and those in a hurry”: 19d Churchill is victorious – then not, after upset (7)[ wordplay: synonym for ‘is victorious’ + NOT backwards (‘after upset’) ][ definition: Churchill ] It’s WINSTON, a name that has been given to various Churchills down the years and which, the Oxford Dictionary of First Names tells us, was invented by the Churchills. Unrelated to the old name Wynnstan, the first Winston was a 1620 Churchill who was given his mother’s surname as a first name, the surname itself coming from a Cotswolds village. Nowadays, you don’t have to be landed to pull off the surname-to-first-name switch, and the practice of assigning to a baby what used to be called its mother’s birth name is occasionally flagged up as the latest trend. A different quirk of naming seems to me to remain largely the preserve of the posh: the unexpected pronunciation. My favourite example, and the subject of our next challenge, belongs to another prime minister. According to family tradition, there is a perfectly good reason why it’s not pronounced the way it looks: when caught during a cattle-rustling expedition, the prime minister’s ancestor called out his name to alert his henchmen to his plight. They misunderstood him, and all went home, which is why the clan has since pronounced it “Hume”. So, reader: how would you clue DOUGLAS-HOME? Now is as good a time as any to recall this paper’s late journalist Simon Hoggart on the former PM: Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who was British prime minister for one year from 1963-64, used to produce crosswords for the Times of London, back in the 1930s.

2/8/2022,"Two years ago, I prayed that the government might make permanent the cancelling of GCSE exams because of Covid. This wasteful, costly, cruel and pointless ritual of teenage evaluation could at last be binned; schools could revert from being testing machines to actually educating children. No such luck. This week, thousands of young people will start their “mocks”, driving through to exams beginning in May, then results in August to prepare for further examination at A-level. For some, half a year will have been spent being measured. Ever since Michael Gove abolished continuous teacher assessment, the exam hall has become the high temple – or torture chamber – of schooling, the great God of metrics rules.  This year, in case the chaos of the past two years has not been “fair”, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, has decided to make things a bit easier. Maths and science exam papers will include formulas which are normally memorised, and humanities papers will allow a wider range of essay topics. In addition, examiners are being asked to be “more generous” to allow for the disruption of the pandemic. Lower scores can fit higher grades. We might ask if, in future, individual children can have their results upgraded if their personal year has been “disrupted”. On the other hand, Zahawi is angry that teachers who have been “informally” assessing their pupils over the past two years have been biased in their favour. How dare they think their pupils might have done better outside the diktat of Zahawi’s sacred regime? Indeed, how dare they know their pupils better than he does? That is a job for statisticians, not teachers. Zahawi is retaliating with proposed tests at 14 as well as at GCSE, with increased central inspection and with a state national tutoring company, costing £25m, whose “catch-up” tutors actually sit in schools. It should do wonders for teacher morale. The truth is, only exams matter. No other European country has subjected its state education to such total nationalisation. The irony is that China, whose dirigiste schools have long entranced Whitehall, is now moving in precisely the opposite direction. President Xi last year ordered an end to early years testing and homework. He cracked down on private tutoring and promoted practical courses at the expense of academic ones. Whitehall should catch up with its hero. We can only weep to think how much learning relevant to a child’s life in the community is being sacrificed in favour of Zahawi’s maths formulas – which not one child in a thousand will ever see again. I cringe to look at a GCSE curriculum. Compulsory maths and science, but no compulsory health, economics, law, civics, computing or human relationships. History and geography are mere “options”. What cult is in charge of this monastery? We have passed through three years of a golden opportunity. Without GCSEs we could have seen whether three years of a different sort of schooling – one involving home and school, online and in-person, individual as well as group experience – might have given a cohort of children a better preparation for life. Instead all we have demonstrated is that we have a public service in the grip of archaic interests and lobbyists with too much to lose – that, and an education secretary lacking the guts to stand up to them.

2/8/2022,"Margaret Atwood, Ben Okri and JM Coetzee have joined more than 100 writers from around the world in calling on the Rwandan president to intervene in the case of the poet Innocent Bahati, who disappeared one year ago today. According to human rights organisation PEN International, Bahati was last seen at a hotel in Nyanza district, in the Southern Province of Rwanda, on 7 February 2021. The poet, who is well-known in Rwanda and had published poetry on YouTube and Facebook, as well as regularly performing at live events, failed to return to Kigali, and his phones have been switched off since.  Media reports state that his disappearance was reported to the Rwanda Investigation Bureau on 9 February, with a spokesperson claiming that he was not in the agency’s custody, but that an investigation was “ongoing”. Bahati is also a teacher at the Green Hills Academy in Kigali. Now more than 100 writers and artists have written to Rwandan president Paul Kagame to express their “grave concern” about Bahati’s life and whereabouts, stating their belief that Bahati’s disappearance is “in relation to his poetry and critical expression on issues affecting Rwandan society”. “We are bringing this matter to your attention, with a plea for urgent action because, one year later, Bahati is still missing and his situation unknown. We note with concern that the Rwandan authorities are yet to disclose any progress or outcome of investigations on his case,” say the authors, led by PEN International president Burhan Sönmez, and also including major international names from Paul Auster to Gioconda Belli, Jonathan Franzen, Yann Martel, Elif Shafak and Michael Ondaatje. They point to reports that Bahati disappeared in a similar manner in 2017 after posting a critical comment on Facebook, reappearing in police custody after several days, and subsequently being imprisoned without trial for three months, although he was not charged for any offence. Bahati was only freed after a court order. And they highlight media reports of a speech in March 2021 attributed to the Rwandan secretary of state in charge of culture, Edouard Bamporiki, in which Bamporiki is reported to have said that “when poetry loses its way, it can mislead the public. It is for this reason that I ask you to forget the difficulties that Rwandan poetry community has known in recent times, but rather to do our part to advise and reprimand those amongst who stray from the right path.” “Coming shortly after the disappearance of Bahati in 2021, these chilling remarks by an official of your administration are hardly coincidental. They suggest a pattern of intolerance to free poetic expression by officials, and they legitimately raise suspicions that Bahati may have been disappeared in relation to his poetry,” say the authors. “We believe that someone within the Rwandan administration knows about the whereabouts or fate of Bahati … Poetry is not a crime. The world awaits to hear the voice of Innocent Bahati, again.”",Arts/Books,Margaret Atwood joins writers calling for urgent action over missing Rwandan poet,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/07/margaret-atwood-joins-writers-calling-for-urgent-action-over-missing-rwandan-poet-innocent-bahati
