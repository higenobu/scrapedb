2/3/2022,"Northern Ireland has been plunged into political crisis amid reports that the first minister, Paul Givan, is to resign over Brexit. Such a move, reported by the BBC’s Stephen Nolan show, would threaten the future of the Stormont government and trigger the resignation of the deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, Sinn Féin’s leader in Northern Ireland.  Neither leader can stay in power if the other quits. The reported move comes just days after the DUP gave Brussels a 21 February deadline to resolve the dispute over Brexit checks and just hours after Stormont’s agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, also a DUP representative, ordered a halt to Brexit checks on food and farm products coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. The resignation of the first and deputy first minister would not trigger the immediate collapse of the Stormont executive allowing it to stumble on till the elections in May. Under the rules, the parties would have six weeks to nominate replacements. But rivals including the Ulster Unionist party say the resignation of the two ministers will further destabilise Northern Ireland and prevent key decisions on an upcoming budget being made. Doug Beattie, the UUP leader, said a Givan resignation would not create leverage in the negotiations over the Irish Sea border but “create more destabilisation here in Northern Ireland”. He told the BBC: “It will create more hardship for the people of Northern Ireland; [we] will not be able to get a budget agreed and through, and at the end of it all, the protocol will still be there.” The latest DUP manoeuvres are being seen by rivals as positioning ahead of the May elections and come amid repeated threats by the party leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, to quit Stormont over the Brexit checks. The party’s popularity has fallen over its handling of Brexit, leaving Sinn Féin in pole position to the be the largest party for the first time according to recent opinion polls. Alliance party MP Stephen Farry said the resignation of the first minister would be “an act of huge harm” to Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland executive would be unable to approve a three-year budget which is currently out to consultation. Also under threat would be the appointment of a victims’ commissioner to deal with troubles legacy killings and injuries and a grant scheme to give householders a £200 grant against rising energy bills. The Traditional Unionist Voice leader, Jim Allister, told the BBC’s Stephen Nolan it was “about time” the first minister resigned, saying it would be “better later than never” if Givan carried out his threat. “There can never be a settlement on this issue,” he said of the Northern Ireland protocol. “The protocol is worse than a pandemic for our constitution position, the protocol kills the union [of the United Kingdom], said Allister.",News/UK news,"Northern Ireland first minister poised to quit over Brexit, reports say",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/03/northern-ireland-first-minister-poised-to-quit-over-brexit-reports-say
2/3/2022,"Windjammers 2 has a character selection screen cheat code. It’s a simple thing: spin the analogue stick in circles a few times and you’ll unlock a dorky superhero named DiscMan. He plays much the same as the rest of the roster, so really it’s a minor visual difference. But this arcade throwback is Windjammers 2 in a nutshell: this game is an ode to the old school so joyfully realised and tightly executed that you can almost hear the percussive jingle of pocket change underneath the hyperactive guitars and bit-crunched commentary. The series had lain dormant since 1994, but French developer DotEmu has revived it with flair. Boiled down to the basics, this stylised sports game is effectively Pong, or Air Hockey. Two opponents punt a plastic Frisbee-style disc back and forth, aiming to throw the other off and score a hit behind the goal line. The longer the disc stays in play, the more momentum it gathers and the tenser things get. Blocking the disc’s path is enough to intercept and throw a shot back, but before long you’ll need to get more creative.  Thankfully, getting creative is where Windjammers 2 makes strides over its 1994 predecessor. It’s also where it becomes apparent that it shares as much, if not more, of its lineage with games such as Street Fighter than with sports games. Special meters, combos, the compressed cheers of an adoring, three-frame animated crowd – it’s all here. Time it correctly and you can follow an intercept with a dazzling special move, sending the disc careening back in flames at breakneck speed. If your opponent has saved their special, they can counter and knock your fancy return straight up into the air, before leaping up and yeeting it back to the other side of the court. Throw in jumps, knockbacks and dashes, and there’s enough strategy and room for mastery here to keep you on your toes constantly. If the phrase “puddle-deep ocean” describes huge games that lack depth, then Windjammers 2 is a bottomless cocktail. Like DotEmu’s Streets of Rage 4, it’s uncompromising about recreating the controller-threatening difficulty of the arcade era but it never feels arbitrary, and it provides a brilliantly fun skillset to eventually master. As long as you don’t mind a few hours of failure while you learn how to commit yourself to the way of the disc, Windjammers 2 is this winter’s sport of the summer.

2/3/2022,"Medal count winnerFour years ago, Norway edged Germany atop the table with a staggering 39 medals (including 14 golds), besting their previous high as the host country in 1994. This time it won’t be nearly as close. The familiar dominance in cross-country skiing, in addition to likely medals in alpine skiing, biathlon, curling, freestyle skiing, ski jumping, snowboarding and speed skating, should end in another record haul. No mean feat for a nation with a smaller population than greater Atlanta. BAG The only question for Norway is whether they’ll match or beat their record of 39 medals from 2018. Gracenote’s final projection: 44. You can’t bet against a country in an event that doubles as a mode of transportation for its citizens, and yes, Norway will dominate in cross-country skiing and biathlon once again, but they’re also strong in the Alpine events and basically anything that involves snow. The resurgent ROC may slow the Norwegian procession, as may host China, which excels in winter sports with flips, twists and other forms of gymnastics. BDCovid will ...... be responsible for at least one completely out-of-nowhere gold medalist thanks to China’s strict ‘Zero Covid’ protocols – which include daily throat swabs for testing and enhanced ‘close contact’ tracing – meaning athletes will face minimum two-day isolation for a positive test and risk missing their competition even if they are asymptomatic. The early days inside the closed loop for athletes and other participants have gone smoothly enough, though an outbreak looms as the doomsday scenario. BAG  ... be all but forgotten by day three. I said the same thing for the Summer Olympics, and when I get one of these predictions right, I have to stick with it. We may see a few more Covid-related absences this time around because omicron is more contagious, but China and the IOC both have plenty of experience building bubbles. BD Breakout starBesides Eileen Gu? Let’s take a flyer on Jordan Stolz. The 17-year-old speed skater from the Wisconsin village of Kewaskum followed up his maiden World Cup medal at Calgary in December with a breakout performance at last month’s US Olympic trials, smashing double Olympic champion Shani Davis’s track record in the 1000m to become the third-youngest American man to make an Olympic team in long track after Eric Heiden and Emery Lehman. BAG Norwegian Alpine skier Aleksander Aamodt Kilde has hit his peak at age 29. He had no top-12 finishes in his prior two Olympics, but won the overall World Cup title in 2020 and leads the speed disciplines this season. Oh, and he’s dating Mikaela Shiffrin. For the USA, curler Chris Plys is competing in mixed doubles and has moved up to vice (second-in-charge) for John Shuster‘s defending gold medalists in the men’s event. For Australia, Jakara Anthony finished fourth in moguls in 2018 and has only gotten better, holding the lead in the overall World Cup standings. For Canada, short-track skater Courtney Sarault has successfully moved up after a strong junior career. For Team GB, it’s all a potential three-medal performance in curling, with the relative newcomer being Jennifer Dodds in mixed doubles and the women’s event. BDBold predictionThe highest-profile border war on the medal table comes down to the women’s ice hockey final, where Canada’s win ensures it will finish with more medals than the United States for only the third time in history. BAG After taking no medals in 2014 and just one in 2018, the US long-track speed skaters bounce back with six medals in Beijing. BDCan’t miss eventAlpine skiing, women’s slalom (9 Feb, 12.45am ET). The Mikaela Shiffrin-Petra Vlhova rivalry that’s captivated the sport all season – they’ve been one-and-two atop the overall World Cup standings while pulling away from the pack all year – reaches a flashpoint on the unknown piste in Yanqing. Shiffrin has dominated the sport’s most technical discipline like no one before her, but Vlhova has won six of the last slaloms on the World Cup circuit dating back to last season. BAG USA v Canada in anything. In women’s bobsled, Kaillie Humphries goes for her third and fourth Olympic golds after switching nationalities and accusing Canadian officials of verbal and mental abuse. In curling, Canada will aim to shake off disappointment from four years ago but will find 2018 gold medalist John Shuster and 2021 world championship bronze medalist Tabitha Peterson in their way. Both countries have contenders in most of the X Games-ish freestyle and snowboard events. And the main event will be the all-but-certain quadrennial (annual, if you add in world championships) showdown in the women’s hockey final.

2/3/2022,"Steph Jones jokes that she used to think she was psychic. The psychotherapist says she can often tell instinctively what a client’s issue is before they’ve even sat down. “I can say to them: ‘All of a sudden my throat is tightening,’ or: ‘I feel dizzy,’ or: ‘I can see a particular image – does this mean anything to you?” she says. This is because Jones has the ability, she explains, to experience not just other people’s emotions but their physical sensations in her own body. And it is a skill that has been invaluable for her work. It was only after she was diagnosed with autism that she realised this was simply part of her neurodiverse profile. “It’s called mirror-emotion or mirror-touch synaesthesia and is part of what being autistic means for me, as well as having hyperawareness, hyperperception, hyperempathy and hypermemory – all of which come in very handy as a therapist,” she says.  People with mirror-touch synaesthesia vicariously experience other people’s emotional and physical sensations in their own bodies. The condition, which is believed to affect 2% of the general population, varies from person to person: it can mean individuals feel the same sensation – like touch – in the same part of the body that another person feels the sensation. Others describe it as an “echo” of the touch. Some clients, understandably, are disconcerted by Jones’s reading of their issues. “But once I explain what it is and it makes rational sense to them – rather than it seeming frightening or paranormal – they usually feel completely elated that someone gets them on that kind of deep level.” It is, she says, “fast-track rapport-building …Being able to tune into someone so quickly means it can feel like we’re skipping the starter and getting right into business, whereas other therapists may need to spend much longer building relationships. I can only describe it as some kind of instant resonance. Clients will often describe how it feels like we’ve always known each other – and it’s just as intense for me as it is for them.” There are more ways, Jones believes, that having autism can turbocharge a mental health specialist: autistic people often excel at problem-solving, enabling them to pick up cues that neurotypical therapists might filter out. They’re unlikely to judge people, enabling clients to feel genuinely accepted, and often have intense interests, which can lead to an obsession with research, training and further education. Jacqueline also feels her autistic traits have helped in her job as an advanced nurse practitioner in a 24-hour crisis assessment team – especially being open-minded. “I am very good at remaining neutral when doing urgent crisis assessments of highly distressed people and their families, which often involve the police and emergency services,” she says. “I am fairly direct and to the point. Again, when you need to assess a difficult situation quickly this is a good skill to have,” she adds. “I also see patterns and themes because my mind likes to find solutions to problems.” Zoë, a specialist neurodevelopmental clinician, credits her autism with allowing her to qualify in several psychotherapy specialisms with ease. “My autism does actually feel like a superpower: I have focused and studied so hard that I have a wealth of experience that clients often reference, saying how it makes their therapeutic process so much easier,” she says. Yet while the mental health experts I speak to say their autism has benefited their work, sadly, it is something they have felt they need to keep from colleagues. Jones, for instance, says – until now – her diagnosis has been a closely guarded secret. “Admitting openly that I am autistic could be professional suicide,” she says. “I’m terrified that, in ‘coming out’, I may fall foul of a misconception: the now widely debunked myth that autistic people are not capable of empathy or feelings.” A keen blogger (under the handle of autistic therapist), Jones was recently thinking about the fact that only 22% of autistic adults are in paid employment. Autistic people can have strengths that may be beneficial to employers, such as tenacity and the ability to see things in a different light, which can be great for problem solving. But getting and keeping a job can be difficult: autism affects communication skills, so people may struggle during job interviews, misunderstanding questions and being judged for not making eye contact. Once in a workplace, the noise of open-plan offices and anxieties over unwritten social rules can be overwhelming. Jones asked her online network of professional autistic people what they did – and was surprised to wake up the next morning to 450 responses, a number that kept growing. They came from people in every walk of life, but Jones was struck by how many worked in mental health, and how many said their greatest fear was colleagues and employers finding out that they were autistic. “I was receiving hundreds of messages from other autistic therapists, psychologists, practitioners, social workers and clinicians, most of whom have chosen not to disclose their diagnosis in work because they were too afraid of stigma, prejudice, unhelpful myths about autism – and discrimination,” she says. In response, she formed an Instagram group, the Autistic Professional Network. Within days, it had 586 followers. “I felt it was important to set up a group where we can safely network, find others who ‘get it’ and remain anonymous if we wish,” says Jones. “Sadly, the common theme we all share is autistic burnout due to hiding who we truly are.” Masking and camouflaging – terms used to describe neurodiverse individuals who seek to hide or minimise their autism traits to fit in with the neurotypical world – are an uncomfortable and exhausting experience, often linked to mental health issues ranging from stress and anxiety to depression, burnout and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts. It might seem counterintuitive to neurotypical people that neurodiverse people who find social interaction complex should choose a career with empathy and connection at its heart. But, says Jones, it makes perfect sense. “Around 1% to 2% of the UK population is autistic, but in my postgraduate year of around 80 students at least five were neurodiverse: over 6%. We’ve spent a lifetime trying to figure ourselves out, often misdiagnosed with mental health issues and desperate for answers. We’ve become accidental experts in that respect.” Maria, a mental health nurse in her mid-50s, agrees that a career in mental health might seem a curious choice to those who know her. She once found talking to people so difficult it was hard for her to speak at all. “It may seem very strange that someone like me, who had so little confidence, was so very shy to the point of mutism, and who had such difficulties with people, interaction and social functioning, was drawn to a career that requires all of those skills, but I was filled with compassion, empathy and a desperate desire to help people, especially those that were also misunderstood,” she says. “I don’t think I actually realised that everyone else didn’t have this extreme anxiety, constant nervousness and incredibly strong sense of justice and fairness,” she adds. “I think what was really driving me was to stop anyone else having to feel the way I always had, to help people where I had been left to my own devices.” Nadia also became interested in psychology after struggling with her own undiagnosed autism. “I often felt that I didn’t understand myself or others,” she says. “I’ve spent most of my life trying to be ‘normal’ and fit in, which has involved huge amounts of time trying to understand people, and I wonder whether this process of understanding others is continued in my work.” Like Jones, Nadia feels her autism has meant she is better at her job. “Despite the common myth that autistic individuals don’t have empathy, I find the opposite, in that I can really connect with the people I work with, and can feel what they feel,” she says. “My brain is quite analytical and notices patterns, which can be helpful in various phases of therapy (assessment, formulation, treatment). I also find clinical conversations a lot easier to have compared with generic, informal small talk.” But Nadia is also worried that divulging her neurodiversity to colleagues could wreck her career. “There can be a lot of misconceptions about autism, and I worry others will assume I am not competent or capable, that I cannot communicate with others,” she says. Abdullah Shahjan, an autistic therapist who works with the National Autistic Society, agrees that disclosing can be dangerous. “Autistic mental health practitioners who want to be open about their condition are all too likely to experience intolerance and negativity, which could seriously damage their careers. The risk is far greater than in other professions. “Neurotypical mental health practitioners aren’t any different from the general public when it comes to understanding autism: that is, they have a negative perception,” he says. “This is exacerbated by the fact that as mental health specialists, the only openly autistic people they are likely to see are patients in crisis. This will inevitably lead them to link autism with an inability to function. “An added problem is that mental health services are still in their infancy,” he adds. “As a specialism, it’s still struggling to be taken seriously as a science and to define best practice. That means that when an autistic practitioner comes along who doesn’t conform, there’s a risk-adverse defensiveness that kicks in.” Jess Hendrickx is director of Hendrickx Associates, a UK-based specialist in autism spectrum conditions, which provides training sessions to employers within the mental health sector. “We need to get rid of the stigma of being autistic in general but especially in the mental health sector,” she says. “One way to do this is for there to be a wider understanding that autistic people are not flawed or broken, but instead process environments and information differently from non-autistic people. These differences can provide clients with a diverse but equally effective approach. “Giving the wider public more positive information on autism should help to challenge any biases people may have about being treated by an autistic mental health professional,” she says. “This, in line with education and training for all staff and managers in mental health settings, will hopefully encourage more autistic people in the field to speak up, and more people to consider this as a career path.” Of course, not all autistic people experience disadvantage in their workplace, but the fear among autistic people working in mental health about “being out” is widely felt. Oxana is an assistant psychologist. “Being autistic for me means that I am on high alert most of the time,” she says. “I tend to overthink social interactions, notice patterns of behaviour, have an excessive urge to understand systems and organisations. This makes me a good therapist because I ask a lot of questions and facilitate patients to find their own truth. I do not have any preconceived notions of one ‘right’ way to solve their problems.” But she wouldn’t dream of disclosing her autism. “I have witnessed how professionals would discuss someone autistic and doubt their abilities,” she says. “I feel that instead of gaining credibility for going through any mental health or neurodiverse difference, I might actually lose some.” Among autistic professionals who have disclosed their autism to colleagues and employers, however, there have been positive outcomes. Karen is a PhD student studying the support of marginalised groups. “My autism helps me in my work because I am a very empathetic and at times an emotionally sensitive person,” she says. “I’ve been told that makes me very relatable and approachable. “I opened up to my employers about my autism recently because in a meeting I couldn’t string a sentence together and was so ashamed. I blurted it out in tears but it was such a relief. Now I know that they have an understanding of why I am the way I am at times. It helps tremendously.” Jones, who has decided to start being more open about her autism, is hoping for a similarly positive experience. “I recently told a long-term client of mine. It was the first time I’d ever disclosed in a professional sphere and I was understandably worried what she might say. But her response was brilliant: surprised, kind of excited and definitely curious.” Jones is now determined to be completely open about her neurodiversity. “I work with hundreds of autistic professionals who are afraid to disclose in work for fear of judgment, so they mask all day, go home and have meltdowns, and it’s the same again the next day,” she says. “I’m taking a huge risk in putting myself out there but I hope that in the long run it will be worth it, not just for me, but for others like me, so they feel brave in owning who they are too.” Some names have been changed.",News/Society,‘Clients say it feels like we’ve always known each other’:  the mental health experts who believe their autism has turbocharged their work,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/03/clients-say-it-feels-like-weve-always-known-each-other-the-mental-health-experts-who-believe-their-autism-has-turbocharged-their-work
2/3/2022,"The image of Vicky McClure, in her latest strong, female cop role, was used the other day by UK counter-terrorism policing to recruit more women into the police. “Strong female leads aren’t just on TV,” the tweet said, above a picture of the actor as Lana Washington, the dynamic, brave, take-no-nonsense bomb-disposal operative in Jed Mercurio’s latest ITV drama, Trigger Point.  And an attractive lure it is. Washington, with her slicked-back hair, chiselled visage and burning passion to save lives, could well turn the heads of intelligent young female graduates, or girls leaving school, to consider a career in policing. But sadly this is drama, not reality. The latest poster boys for the Metropolitan police, a force where less than one in three officers are women, well below the national average, are a breed of men who flaunt only their toxic masculinity, aggressive misogyny and deeply embedded rape culture, which they pass off as mere banter. It is worth repeating a bit of the dialogue of this latest Met police drama, as revealed by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) watchdog. The characters are 19 male officers in Charing Cross police station, the time frame 2016-2018. Hardly a period piece, the subject of this excerpt is how to seduce a woman. “Getting a woman into bed is like spreading butter. It can be done with a bit of effort using a credit card, but it’s quicker and easier just to use a knife.” Or this gem to a female colleague. “I would happily rape you … if I was single … if I was single I would happily chloroform you.” And this piece of marital advice: “You ever slapped your missus? It makes them love you more. Seriously since I did that she won’t leave me alone. Now I know why these daft c**ts are getting murdered by their s****** boyfriends. Knock a bird about and she will love you. Human nature.” Followers of this particular horror show will know these latest revelations come after the rape and murder of a young woman, Sarah Everard, by a Met officer, Wayne Couzens, who was part of another unit, the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command, which is now subject to a root-and-branch review of its culture by the Met. Then there were the scenes of officers manhandling women who attended a peaceful vigil for Sarah at Clapham Common after her death. In previous episodes of how not to persuade women to join up, male officers guarding the murder scene in a London park where the bodies of Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry lay fatally stabbed – surely the most sensitive of duties – instead decided to abuse their position to take photos, some showing their bodies, shared them in WhatsApp groups and called the victims “dead birds”. Yet the Met tried to say this week that this was not about institutional misogyny. Instead, the behaviours exhibited so dramatically at Charing Cross were those of a small number with attitudes and beliefs that were not welcome in the force – AKA the bad apple theory; never mind that the police watchdog, the IOPC, explicitly rejected this theory and said what was on display was part of an offensive Met police culture. The bad apple excuse has long been trotted out. It was given to me 10 years ago, when, as crime correspondent for this newspaper, I exposed for the first time the hidden reality of police officers abusing their positions to sexually abuse, rape and stalk women who were victims of crime or witnesses – the sort of abuse of power exhibited by Couzens so many years later when he used his warrant card to stop Sarah Everard as she walked home. While the official line in 2012 to my reporting was the “bad apple” excuse, one senior female officer telephoned to thank me for shining a light on abuse by male officers because it had been known about but swept under the carpet for too long. Back then, there were, as now, promises of change, talk of a determination throughout policing to identify and remove those who betray the reputation of the overwhelming majority of officers etc, over so many years. But now it is 2022 and I, like every other women I speak to, am enraged again at the behaviour of police officers. It seems that nothing has changed – indeed, the unchecked, pervasive and violent attitudes to women seem more, not less, prevalent. A young female relative, a graduate who is brave and intelligent – all the qualities displayed by McClure in her fantasy portrayal of the life of a female cop – told me this week that she was ripping up her application to join the police, so horrified is she by what she sees and hears. When I protested that women such as her could forge change from within, she shook her head in refusal: “Why would I put myself through that in my life, just why?” Sandra Laville, a former Guardian crime correspondent, is now its environment correspondent",Opinion/Opinion,An entire generation of women is being turned off a career in the police | Sandra Laville,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/03/generation-women-turned-off-career-police
2/3/2022,"Officials in Texas are rejecting thousands of mail-in ballots ahead of the first 2022 midterm primary votes next month, raising serious alarm that a new Republican law is going to disenfranchise droves of eligible voters.  The state’s 1 March primary is being closely watched as the first important testof one of the dozens of voting restrictions GOP-controlled state legislatures enacted in 2021. Last August, Texas Republicans passed a sweeping new voting law, SB 1, that imposes new identification requirements in the mail-in voting process, prohibits election officials from soliciting mail-in ballots, provides partisan poll watchers with more autonomy at the polls and outlaws 24-hour and curbside voting. They claimed it was to reduce fraud, despite little evidence of it being committed in 2020. Critics smell discrimination. The March primary is the first election cycle the new law is in effect as voters go to the polls to choose their party’s nominee for US House races and the state governor, among others. County election officials are already seeing significant consequences from the new rules around mail-in voting. So far, they have rejected 2,202 of the 32,817 applications for mail-in ballots submitted – a 6.7% rejection rate, according to the Texas secretary of state’s office. Texas already has strict limits on who can vote by mail, allowing only those who are age 65 and older, disabled or out of town for the entire election period to do so. Those who qualify can continue to request mail-in ballots until mid-February, and officials and voting advocates are worried that the number of rejections could rise as more people submit their applications. They also say it does not portend well for the general election in November, when turnout will be higher. “It’s already a clusterfuck,” said Charlie Bonner, a spokesperson for Move Texas, a group that works on voter mobilization in Texas. The source of the vast majority of those rejections is a new provision in state law that requires voters to provide either their Texas driving license number or the last four digits of their social security number – or both – on their application for vote by mail. Some voters registered originally with only one of those numbers, and if they now put the other on their application, it gets rejected. “We’re going to lose a lot of voters and I don’t think they’re going to be coming back. I think it was purposely done to try to cull out voters and make it harder for them to participate in our democracy,” said Grace Chimene, the president of the Texas chapter of the League of Women Voters, a non-partisan group that works on voting issues. The rejection numbers in some of the state’s largest counties are extremely high. In Travis county, home of state capital Austin, a little under one-third of the absentee ballot applications were rejected because of problems with the ID requirements. In Dallas and Tarrant counties, election officials have rejected 12% and 16% of mail-in applications already because of ID issues. “The reason why these are happening is to make it harder to vote in Texas and it impacts poor people, it impacts voters of color, Black voters especially, Hispanic voters and disabled voters and right now, older voters,” Chimene said. Advocates also dismissed the idea that the difficulties in Texas are growing pains that will diminish as the state and election officials get used to administering the new law. “Their intent was never for this to be a one-time problem,” Bonner said. “This is working exactly as it was intended – to confuse people, to create simple mistakes that get applications and ballots thrown out … they are trying to create the problems to justify what they have done.” One of the people denied a ballot was Kenneth Thompson, a 95-year-old second world war veteran who registered to vote before the state required voters to provide a driver’s license or social security number when they registered. He told Click2Houston he has never missed a vote, but that now his request for a mail-in ballot was denied twice. His daughter re-registered him to vote to ensure he could cast a ballot in the primary. Bonner said: “It’s one of these problems of when they legislate in conspiracy theories and not actually in fact. Real people get hurt when you are not legislating in reality.” The Texas secretary of state’s office says they are taking steps to lower the likelihood of rejection. In a 20 January video, John Scott, Texas’ GOP secretary of state, released a video encouraging Texans to put both their state ID number and last four digits of their social security number on the mail-in ballot application. The state is also working to update voter records to include both the social security numbers and driver’s license numbers, and recently released guidance to local election officials on how to help voters fix deficient applications. But election officials face another problem. SB 1 makes it a state jail felony for election officials to solicit mail-in ballot applications from voters. That provision has made local election officials wary of what they can say to voters about mail-in voting, said Isabel Longoria, the top election official in Harris county, the most populous in the state. “I’ve got to be able to talk about mail ballots. I’ve got to be able to encourage people here who can vote by mail, we still encourage people to vote by mail if they are infirm in a pandemic … even me saying that in this interview, that may not be legal,” said Longoria, who is suing the state over the anti-solicitation requirement. “How shocking of a world is it where it’s not that I just can’t send mail, we’re even having to tiptoe around how we even talk about mail ballots.” There have been problems outside the mail-in voting process, too. Texas does not have online voter registration, and the Texas secretary of state initially refused to provide the League of Women Voters with thousands of new paper forms they could use to register voters, citing a paper shortage and supply chain problems. After a warning it might be running afoul of federal law, the Texas secretary of state’s office provided the League with 7,000 voter registration forms. “I was irritated. It just didn’t make any sense to me,” Chimene said. “I don’t know what changed. Probably all the pressure of being in the news, made the secretary of state finally provide the forms. No apology.” The Texas Democratic party announced plans in January to print 500,000 voter registration postcards.

2/3/2022,"Afrayed sheet of A4 paper bearing the lyrics to Turn Your Lights Down Low, with scribbled corrections; a pair of old football boots still with mud in the cleats; the surface of a battered acoustic guitar, deteriorated through overuse. Such poignant relics are few and far between in the first touring exhibition devoted to Bob Marley, which relies largely on portraiture, framed gold discs and staged recreations to tell its tale. Promising an immersive experience illustrating the philosophy, vision and drive that made Marley one of the most famous singers on the planet, the Bob Marley One Love Experience unfolds across six rooms, over two floors of the Saatchi Gallery, London. And the giant red, green and gold replica of the multiplatinum Legend compilation album that takes centre stage in the opening One Love Music Room sets the tone. Aside from his date and place of birth displayed on a banner on the wall, there is precious little information about the man himself, though many may already be familiar with the tale. There’s the award to mark his 1994 induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and some backstage tour passes, but the most striking thing in the room is a wall-length portrait by Mr Brainwash that cleverly incorporates all of the Island Records album covers, displayed opposite replicas of the albums themselves.  The One Love Forest offers a chance to slouch on beanbags or mount a rope-swing, but we’re hardly transported to the Jamaican countryside; beneath the hazy green lights and chirping birdsong, the fug evokes disinfectant and artificial grass, the plastic plants reminding us that we’re in Babylon and not the idyllic hills of Nine Mile, where Marley spent his formative years. The semi-immersive aspect continues in the Soul Shakedown Studio, where Bluetooth headphones allow us to enjoy concert footage on various video screens. There are previously unseen photographs on display, including live shots from early tours, Marley flanked by Jamaican politicians Michael Manley and Edward Seaga at the One Love Peace Concert, and an alternative of the lift shot that adorned the back cover of Uprising, evoking key moments of his career. The Beautiful Life zone salutes Marley’s love of football and table tennis, but there’s a gratuitous display of the family-sanctioned Adidas Ajax third kit shoe, ironically beneath the song quote, “Don’t gain the world and lose your soul / Wisdom is better than silver and gold,” emphasising the tussles between art and commerce at the heart of the posthumous Marley industry. Upstairs, a long corridor littered with stage gear leads to the Concrete Jungle and Fan Art exhibition, which has more Mr Brainwash pieces and a range of portraits by largely uncredited artists – many of which are captivating. A piece made with discarded mobile phone components is particularly striking; others suggest Marley as a cosmic warrior, or biblical prophet. The final room honours widow Rita and the children and grandchildren who have become feted performers in their own right (including Ziggy, Stephen, Julian, Damian and Skip). Then exit through the gift shop, where One Love mugs and jigsaw puzzles are prominently displayed. As implied by the name, the Bob Marley One Love Experience is not especially nuanced, nor trying to be deep; this is very much a commercial enterprise celebrating Marley as an industry success story as much as a creative force. Nevertheless, the family-friendly format is inclusive (if not hugely instructive), and whether diehard devotee or casual listener, there is plenty to savour for an hour or two if approached with an open mind.  Bob Marley One Love Experience is at Saatchi Gallery, London, until 18 April.",Arts/Music,Bob Marley One Love Experience review – corporate exhibition can’t satisfy the soul,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/bob-marley-one-love-experience-review-saatchi-gallery-london
2/3/2022,"A decision by a Democratic Unionist minister to halt all Brexit checks on food and animals entering Northern Ireland has been described by Ireland’s European commissioner as “an absolute breach of international law”. The move announced by the devolved administration’s agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, on Wednesday has been branded an electioneering stunt by opposition parties in Northern Ireland and has set the UK on a collision course with the EU.  Mairead McGuinness, the finance commissioner in Brussels, said the two sides were working “tirelessly” to resolve the dispute over the checks, and the move – which came into effect on Thursday – was unhelpful. “This announcement has created uncertainty and unpredictability and certainly no stability, so I’m not sure what the purpose of this move is … it’s an absolute breach of international law,” she told RTE. A spokesperson for the European Commission said the issue would be raised at a meeting between the UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič later on Thursday. “The European Commission will closely monitor developments in Northern Ireland pursuant to this announcement. It recalls the responsibility of the UK government for the respect of the international obligations it has entered into. The protocol is the one and only solution we have found with the UK to protect the Good Friday (Belfast) agreement.”. That Brussels did not reference any legal action in its statement indicates that diplomacy will be the first line of offence in the latest row. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, also described the move as “a breach of international law”. But the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, told ITV that the decision was a matter for the Northern Ireland government and that such unilateral action “was exactly the sort of thing” London had been warning the EU may happen to ensure goods move across the Irish Sea seamlessly. The DUP MP Sammy Wilson confirmed to BBC Good Morning Ulster that the advice was given by the former Northern Ireland attorney general John Larkin. He predicted the move would accelerate a solution after almost a year of negotiations between the UK and Brussels. “If it requires a bit of a kick for a bit of reality to come into these talks, then what has happened today is a bit of kick. This will also test whether the checks are really necessary because 95% of the goods are not going near the Irish republic.” Simon Hoare, the Conservative MP and chair of the Northern Ireland select committee, suggested the move had put the reputation of the UK at stake. He tweeted: “In relation to NI Protocol checks: I’m a Conservative. I believe in the Rule of Law and adhering to obligations we voluntarily entered. There’s no ifs and buts on this. The reputation of the UK on these matters is important. Anyone who cares about the UK should feel the same.” It was not clear at Belfast port on Thursday morning if Anthony Harbison, the permanent secretary at Northern Ireland’s Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, was carrying out Poots’s order. Lorries coming off the 6am ferry from Cairnryan in Scotland were still being directed to the border control post with officials in hi-vis jackets seen conducting checks in the back of at least one lorry. Seamus Leheny, of the trade association Logistics UK, told BBC reporters at the port that the order only applied to checks on the 3% of lorries carrying food and animals. He added that the removal of checks would not mean a reduction in the customs administration and other paperwork his members were obliged to complete. Northern Ireland is due to hold elections in May and opinion polls suggest the Irish nationalists Sinn Féin could overtake the DUP to become the largest party for the first time. Poots, who was leader of the DUP last May, is also facing local turmoil. Last week he lost out in his attempt to be selected for the South Down constituency in the upcoming local election.",News/Politics,Halt to Northern Ireland Brexit checks ‘a breach of international law’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/halt-to-northern-ireland-brexit-checks-a-breach-of-international-law
2/3/2022,"The US decision to deploy more than 3,000 US troops in Germany, Poland and Romania is a “destructive step” that makes it harder to reach a compromise over Ukraine, Russia’s deputy foreign minister has said, as Moscow continues to build up its forces. Alexander Grushko said the move by Joe Biden would “increase military tension and reduce scope for political decision”, and would “delight” Ukrainian authorities, who would continue sabotaging the Minsk agreements “with impunity”. The Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015 were designed to reach a political settlement in the east of Ukraine, including greater autonomy.  The US said on Wednesday it was sending 1,700 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division to Poland, while a headquarters unit of about 300 from the 18th Airborne Corps will move to Germany and a 1,000-strong armoured unit was being transferred from Germany to Romania. The move is in response to Russia’s deployment of an estimated more than 125,000 troops within striking distance of the Ukrainian border, including nearly half of its available battalion tactical groups and support units. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesperson, said the US movements were “designed to deter aggression and enhance our defensive capabilities in frontline allied states. We expect them to move in coming days.” Vladimir Putin “continues to add forces, combined arms, offensive capabilities; even over just the last 24 hours he continues to add in western Russia and Belarus, and in the Mediterranean and the north Atlantic”, Kirby added. “He has shown no signs of being interested or willing to de-escalate the tensions.” Meanwhile, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Thursday that Russia had been moving 30,000 combat troops and modern weapons to Belarus in recent days, Moscow’s biggest military deployment to the country since the end of the cold war. The deployment included Spetsnaz special operations forces, Su-35 fighter jets, dual capable Iskander missiles and S-400 air defence systems, Stoltenberg said. “All this will be combined with Russia’s annual nuclear forces exercise,” he added. The term “dual capable”, which Stoltenberg used for the Iskander missiles, is used to describe weapons meant for conventional and nuclear warfare. The moves come ahead of a fresh flurry of diplomacy. On Wednesday Boris Johnson warned Putin in a phone call that any further incursion into Ukraine would be “a tragic miscalculation”, according to Downing Street. The Kremlin account of the call said Putin had complained that his demand for security guarantees had not been met and accused the Kyiv government of “the chronic sabotage” of the Minsk agreements. On Thursday the Turkish president and wildcard of Nato diplomacy, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will fly to Kyiv to offer himself again in the role of mediator between Ukraine and Russia. The Erdoğan mediation proposal has not yet been picked up by Russia but Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, and İbrahim Kalın, the chief adviser to Erdoğan, spoke on Tuesday about their commitment to “deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine”, according to a White House statement. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, was also due to speak to Putin on Wednesday evening, their third conversation in less than a week. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Wednesday night that he would meet Putin in Moscow “soon”, without providing a precise date. Scholz, who faces criticism at home and abroad for acting too passively over the Ukraine crisis, said “endangering the territorial sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine would come at a very high price” and that Russia was aware of this. While the former German chancellor turned Russian gas lobbyist Gerhard Schröder has accused Ukraine of “sabre rattling”, Scholz said he was not taking advice from his centre-left predecessor. “I didn’t ask him for advice, and he didn’t give me any,” Scholz told the broadcaster ZDF. Biden and Macron pledged to coordinate their response to the crisis in a phone call on Wednesday, while the French leader’s office said he would be talking to Putin again on Thursday evening. The decision to deploy US troops follows diplomatic efforts that have so far failed to deliver any progress in defusing the crisis. The Kremlin claims it has China’s support in the standoff – backing that would be demonstrated when Putin meets Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was the latest Nato leader to visit Kyiv on Wednesday in a show of support, meeting the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. After the talks, Zelenskiy said Ukraine was focused “only on peace”, but that it had the right to defend itself. Rutte said it was “essential for dialogue to continue” between Russia and the other players. There has also been exchange of documents over the past few weeks between the US, Nato and Russia setting out their respective positions on European security, and a series of phone calls between the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The US has suggested a number of areas for negotiation and possible confidence-building measures but has insisted there can be no compromise over Ukraine’s right to join Nato. The alliance has also stated that is non-negotiable. Russia’s central demand is for guarantees that Nato will not expand farther eastward.",News/World news,Ukraine crisis: Russia criticises US military moves as ‘destructive step’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/ukraine-crisis-russia-criticises-us-military-moves-as-destructive-step
2/3/2022,"The hundreds of bush fires that hit southern Australia on 7 February 2009 felt, according to witnesses, apocalyptic. It was already hellishly hot that day: 46.4C in Melbourne. As the fires erupted, day turned to night, flaming embers the size of pillows rained down, burning birds fell from the trees and the ash-filled air grew so hot that breathing it, one survivor said, was like “sucking on a hairdryer”. More than 2,000 homes burned down, and 173 people died. New South Wales’s fire chief, visiting Melbourne days later, encountered “shocked, demoralised” firefighters, racked by “feelings of powerlessness”. Australians call the event Black Saturday – a scorched hole in the national diary. There, it contends with Red Tuesday, Ash Wednesday, Black Thursday, Black Friday and Black Sunday on Australia’s calendar of conflagration. But recently it has been surpassed – they all have – by the Black Summer, the cataclysmic 2019-20 fire season that killed hundreds with its smoke and burned an area the size of Ireland. A study estimated that the bushfires destroyed or displaced 3 billion animals; its stunned lead author couldn’t think of any fire worldwide that had killed nearly so many.  This will keep happening. As the planet heats, combustible landscapes will dry and ignite. Less fire-prone lands, such as Greenland, will start catching fire, too. Environmentalists now urge us to imagine the whole world aflame. If our old picture of climate breakdown was a melting glacier, our new one is a wildfire. Its message is simple and urgent: the higher we crank up the heat, the more everything will burn – call this the “thermostat model”. With headlines reporting enormous fires from Sacramento to Siberia, it’s easy to feel that we’re already on the brink of a devastating global conflagration. The truth, though, is stranger. Satellites allow researchers to monitor wildfires around the world. And when they do, they don’t see a planet igniting. Rather, they see one where fires are going out, and quickly. Fire has a long and productive place in human history, but there’s now less of it around than at any point since antiquity. We’re driving fire from the land and from our daily lives, where it was once a constant presence. What used to be a harmonious relationship between humanity and fire has become a hostile one. Fewer fires burn today, but the ones left are formidable. Our pyroscape has become deranged, with fire taking on new shapes, visiting new places and consuming new fuels. The results are as confounding as they are unsettling, and our instincts are poor guides. Although we often hear about fires where rich people reside, such as in Australia’s south and the US west, fires kill the most – by far – in places where poor people live, like south-east Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The deadliest fires aren’t the largest and most spectacular ones, but the smaller, regular ones that are rarely reported by global media. They kill by smoke rather than flame, and their main cause isn’t global heating. Many are kindled by corporate-driven land clearance. None of these conclusions should be particularly comforting. What they suggest, rather, is that fire is more complex than the thermostat model suggests. It’s shaped by how we grow our food and place our settlements as much as it is by how we fuel our cars. Addressing our fire problem will thus require more than managing the rising temperatures of recent years – though that’s still essential. It will also require us to confront a longer history that, since the Industrial Revolution, has thrown our relationship with fire out of whack. Our rapid economic growth has taken fire from old places and carried it to new ones. The climate crisis has unbalanced things further. Today’s unpredictable fires are a complex product of our economy and ecology. They’re just not ones we’ve prepared ourselves for. Humans didn’t “start the fire”, the noted pyrohistorian William Martin Joel has argued. “It was always burning, since the world’s been turning.” The Joel Hypothesis, we now know, is only half right. People didn’t invent fire – that part is true. But, surprisingly, it’s a relatively recent phenomenon. For something like the first nine-tenths of Earth’s history, a stretch of around 4bn years, the planet was an unburnable rock. Fire requires fuel, oxygen and a spark. Lightning, volcanoes and even tumbling rocks can provide ignition, but without vegetation and oxygen, nothing will burn. It was only after cyanobacteria pumped the atmosphere full of oxygen and mosses and stemmed plants spread over land, which they did around 450m years ago, that the world’s first fire broke out. That wasn’t just the first fire on Earth, but also the only fire within trillions of miles. The sun, despite appearances, isn’t aflame; its heat and light come from nuclear fusion, not combustion. (“Don’t think of the sun as a giant campfire,” advises physicist Scott Baird, but as “a giant hydrogen bomb”.) We know of no other planet, even outside the solar system, where fire exists. Fire flourishes where life does, and the two depend on each other. There are pyrophilous (“fire-loving”) plants and animals that organise their lives around fire, such as the beetles that lay eggs in burned trees or pine cones that need flames to release their seeds. More than individual species, whole ecosystems depend on fire to clear space. In many habitats, fire is “as fundamental to sustaining plants and animals” as sun and rain are, a 2005 scientific survey found. The most successful pyrophilous species is Homo sapiens. Early humans used fire for light, warmth, social gatherings and protection from predators. Fire lets us absorb nutrients quickly through cooking, rather than spending hours chewing every day as our primate cousins do. Chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas all eat raw food, and they all have much smaller brains. The caloric boost of cooking underwrites our large, resource-heavy brains. Simply put: no fire, no us. No us in an evolutionary sense, and no us in a historical one, too. Every known human society has used fire. Our ancestors didn’t just dispel darkness and prepare food with it, they shaped their environments: repelling pests, flushing out game and making clearings. With spears, they could hunt individual animals; with firesticks, they could alter whole landscapes. It’s easy to think of our forebears, using their torches to set forest fires, as vandals, but it’s more accurate to see them as gardeners. Fire let people domesticate spaces by opening pathways, creating meadows and beating back the wilderness. The ancient Romans referred to a clearing burned in the woods as a lucus, a sacred grove where the light came through – it shares a root with “lucid”. People also set their surroundings alight to protect themselves against wildfires; doing so let them regularly burn away fuels that, if left to accumulate, might feed a hard-to-control blaze. Thus did “fires of choice”, in the words of the anthropologist Henry Lewis, replace “fires of chance”. What must it have been like to use fire this way? Victor Steffensen sheds some light in his recent book Fire Country: How Indigenous Fire Management Could Help Save Australia. In it, he tells of two brothers, Poppy Musgrave and Tommy George, Aboriginal elders and the last speakers of the Awu Laya language. The pair grew up in the era of the stolen generations, the long stretch from the early 20th century to the 70s when Australian authorities forced vast numbers of Aboriginal children to assimilate by removing them from their parents and communities. Musgrave and George dodged that fate by hiding from the police in mailbags. By evading capture, the brothers served, until their deaths, as key repositories for an imperilled culture. Not only did they carry their language into the 21st century, they also carried firesticks. “The old people used to burn the country all the time,” Musgrave told Steffensen. For Musgrave and George, fire wasn’t destructive, but purifying. Thick vegetation, the sort others might interpret as lush or abundant, elicited howls of frustration from them. The overgrown country, in their view, was “sick” and “suffering”. “We need to burn it,” they exclaimed, to make it healthy. The name in English for someone who starts fires is arsonist. It’s telling that there’s no familiar word for someone who carefully tends a landscape with flame. But Steffensen’s book shows this to be as venerable a calling as any other. It bulges with wisdom relayed by the brothers: when and how to light boxwood country afire so nearby ecosystems remain intact, which gum trees to burn and which to leave be. Australia, where Aboriginal people once travelled with firebrands and kindled the brush as they walked, offers a prominent example of firestick farming. But there’s every reason to suppose that the practice was global. From the 16th century onwards, Europeans encountering the peoples of Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Pacific reported seeing intentionally set fires in all those places. This shouldn’t have been surprising; Europeans had nurtured their own lands by burning them, too. The history of humanity is the history of fire, but you wouldn’t know that from seeing how people live today. Fire – natural and human-made – has been banished from view, to the point where we regard its return with great apprehension. Some of that fear makes sense. For centuries, cities had been built largely of organic materials – wood and thatch were common – and burned easily. London’s 1666 fire, which destroyed more than 13,000 structures, is famous, but it wasn’t anomalous. A fire perhaps 20 times that size had levelled Constantinople six years earlier. Europeans extinguished those “astonishingly frequent” fires, the historian Eric Jones argues, by switching to flame-resistant material. The “brick frontier”, as Jones calls it, spread through Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, and soon elsewhere. As brick, concrete and eventually steel structures replaced wooden ones, urban blazes grew rare. But Europeans fireproofed more than just their cities. Their inventions also drove fire from daily life. Steam technologies moved burning from hearths to boilers. Electricity provided energy, light and heat cleanly and quietly, with no indication of its origins. Our lifestyles today depend on combustion, in that more than five-sixths of global energy comes from burning fossil fuels. But aside from the tightly controlled flame of a stovetop gas burner or the occasional candle or cigarette, many of us can go weeks without seeing fire. Is that a problem? It might have been to the ancients, many of whom worshipped fire gods. And yet the dominant mindset of modernity has been one of intense pyrophobia. The Enlightenment, as its name suggests, prized illumination. But it did so as “light without heat”, the philosopher Michael Marder has observed. As western technologies banished flames, western thinkers came to see firestick farming as dangerously primitive. Or, perhaps, just dangerous. European scientific forestry, which emerged in the 18th century and spread around the world, took as its mission the extirpation of fire. “Only YOU can prevent forest fires” was the message the US Forest Service drilled into children starting in the 1940s through its famed mascot Smokey Bear. But should forest fires – which occur naturally and have been profitably kindled by humans for millennia – be prevented? Forestry officials wouldn’t entertain that question seriously until the late 20th century. Until then, they sought to snuff out flames everywhere. Today, forest managers have backed off their suppression strategy and are coming to appreciate cultural burning. (An Australian university granted the Aboriginal elders Poppy Musgrave and Tommy George honorary doctorates before they died in 2006 and 2016.) But the widespread fear of fire remains. This is surely why environmentalists latch on to images of wildfires. There’s nothing unnatural, novel or even necessarily worrisome about a forest burning. But we are children of the Enlightenment, and fire terrifies us. Infernos blaze hot on our screens. And yet overall, as scientists have repeatedly noted, the amount of land burning yearly is going down. By a lot. Between 1998 and 2015, it decreased by a quarter, according to a 2017 study in the journal Science. Even flame-addled California, where fires have increased in the past two decades, is still markedly less fiery than it once was. Stephen Pyne, a brilliant chronicler of fire’s history, estimates that before Europeans arrived in California, fires, natural and anthropogenic, burned twice the area that they now do. This counterintuitive finding – the global decrease in fires – isn’t good news. The main reason fires are dwindling is that humanity is expanding. Sprawling settlements and industrial farms act as firebreaks in the savannas of South America and Africa and the grasslands of the Asian steppe. Livestock consume vegetation that otherwise might feed big burns. “A shift toward more capital-intensive agriculture has led to fewer and smaller fires,” the authors of the 2017 Science study concluded. And that decrease – especially in flame-reliant landscapes in sub-Saharan Africa and northern Australia – outweighs the uptick in headline-grabbing megafires. It might seem that extinguishing wildfires has made the world safer. But what it has really done is made the fires stranger. Where flame grows rare, biomass that would normally have regularly burned instead piles up as kindling. Decades of fire suppression is enough to build timebombs, and the supercharged blazes that do break out are more severe and harder to control. This is what the US now experiences every year: overall, the number of its fires is shrinking, while their size and the cost of fighting them are growing. Purposeful burning can relieve the dangerous accumulation of fuel loads, but, without the intimate knowledge of a landscape that comes with centuries of tending it, it can also go badly awry. In 2000, a prescribed burn in a federally protected area of New Mexico got out of hand. More than 18,000 people had to flee, and the fire came perilously close to the tritium facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (had it burned, radioactive contaminants would have spread widely). “The calculations that went into this”, confessed the secretary of the interior, “were seriously flawed.” Surely they were, but in place like New Mexico, where decades of settlement spread and fire suppression have starved the land of flame, the slightest contact between industrial life and dry vegetation – a downed power line, an exhaust pipe brushing grass – can mean conflagration. In 2018, a blaze in California known as the Ranch Fire burned 1,660 sq km. Its start? Sparks from a rancher striking a metal stake with a hammer. The resulting fire lasted 160 days. Such eruptive fires will only worsen with global heating, which dries fuels in fire-prone places. But global heating itself is a consequence of our modern relationship to fire. Because, despite appearances, we haven’t actually stopped burning things. Instead, we’ve extinguished open and visible fires and relegated burning to boilers and vehicular combustion chambers. There, fire feasts not on living grasses, shrubs and trees, but on fossilised plants that died hundreds of millions of years ago. The difference is vast. Societies using living vegetation for fuel are tightly limited by what the land can grow, and what people and animals can haul. With fossil fuels, however, we dig deep into concentrated stores of ancient organic matter, incinerating whole centuries’ worth of buried plant life annually. The coal, oil and gas we burn each year required as much organic matter to make as the entire planet grows in roughly 600 years. And as we burn it, we release long-dormant stores of carbon into the atmosphere. This has changed our relationship with time, the fire historian Pyne has observed. We used to burn what grew around us, with effects largely limited to our own day. Now we excavate plant matter from the deep past, burn it in the present, and send its byproducts wafting into an uncertain future. One thing we already know about that future is that it will be hot. And that heat is lengthening fire seasons in the most flame-prone environments. After Black Saturday in 2009, Australians recalibrated their index of fire danger, adding a new category, “catastrophic”, to describe the record-breaking weather conditions that they now regularly encounter. Thus far, the raised temperatures haven’t resulted in more fire overall; the global trend is still downward. But like fire suppression, the increased heat is encouraging new kinds of unruly fires, such as those in the far north. Arctic lands contain huge reservoirs of peat – ancient vegetation that hasn’t entirely broken down. Historically, much of that peat has been buried under frozen ground or protected from flames by cold and damp conditions. But as permafrost melts and summers lengthen, those rich peatlands encounter fire and burn furiously. Scientists are now wrapping their heads around “zombie fires” that can survive through winter by feeding on smouldering peat underground and emerge in the spring, releasing huge stores of sequestered carbon. We’re now well into a geologic epoch in which our behaviour is the main driver of the climate. The Anthropocene is what we usually call it – the age of humanity. Pyne thinks we might just as well call it the Pyrocene – the age of fire. It was burning that got us here, and now we’re facing the consequences of Earth’s “unhinged pyrogeography”. Seeing flames lick the suburbs of Athens, Greece, or Boulder, Colorado, it’s hard to disagree. We’re addicted to burning things, but we’ve kept fire like a shameful secret, hiding it from sight and bottling it up in boilers. Now it’s spilling out, uncontrolled: the return of the repressed. The wildfires tormenting combustible landscapes such as California – which has experienced eight of its 10 largest recorded fires in just the past five years – highlight the threat of climate breakdown. And yet the California fires, for all the attention they’ve received, have been more dramatic than deadly. The 2018 Ranch Fire, which burned for months, only directly killed one person. California’s entire 2020 fire season, the largest in its modern history, was about as lethal as three days of traffic accidents on California roads. That’s something we rarely acknowledge about megafires: they burn plants and animals, but spare humans. The Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters at the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium maintains a database of more than 22,000 large global disasters since 1900. The earthquakes in its database killed on average more than 2,500 people, and the floods nearly 11,000. But the wildfires? They killed on average 23, rounding up. It’s not that fires are harmless. It’s rather that the ways they harm people aren’t the ways that come most readily to mind. Unless you’re a firefighter, you’re extremely unlikely to die in a big blaze. But you might shave years off your life by inhaling the particulates and chemicals that fires release. The death toll from wildfire smoke is enormous: 339,000 die a year from such smoke-related maladies as strokes, heart failure and asthma, according to the Australian public health scientist Fay Johnston and her fellow researchers. A few die in the affluent places known for their telegenic fires, such as North America and southern Australia (more than 400 from Australia’s 2019–20 Black Summer, Johnston and her colleagues have estimated). But the vast majority die in poorer places, where fires are smaller, yet chronic: sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia. The south-east Asian fires are particularly worrisome. Rather than visiting land that has regularly burned for millennia, they’re feeding on Indonesian forests and peatlands newly penetrated by economic development. These aren’t thermostat fires, where global heating is the main culprit (though it’s not helping). They’re chainsaw fires, lit as timber, palm oil, rubber, petroleum and gas firms pry open the closed-canopy forest. Moisture floats out, wind blows in and a largely fireproof ecosystem becomes combustible. Plantation managers have sped things along by torching trees to clear the land. And it seems that the people those plantations evicted may be setting fires in retaliation. In 1996, as industrial development pressed on Indonesia’s rice lands in Java, the nation’s president, Suharto, initiated the Mega Rice Project to convert the peatlands of Central Kalimantan into Indonesia’s new rice bowl. Over the quiet grumbles of experts – Suharto, then nearly 30 years in power, was not known for his receptivity to dissent – he had tens of thousands of workers dig 6,000km of canals through Central Kalimantan’s waterlogged peat forests. Developmentally, this accomplished little – even drained, the area was a poor place to grow rice. But environmentally, it exposed long-submerged peatlands, with their vast stores of prehistoric carbon, to the flames. No single one of Indonesia’s many fires in recent decades has been especially noteworthy. But altogether they’ve been cataclysmic. In 1997, a dense haze of airborne particulates from Indonesia’s fires was perceptible as far as the Philippines and Thailand. That year, on Sumatra – centre of Indonesia’s fires – a commercial plane crashed due to poor visibility and killed all 234 aboard. The next day, two ships collided off the coast of Malaysia for the same reason, and 29 crew members died. The economist Maria Lo Bue found that Indonesians who were toddlers during the 1997 haze grew less tall, entered school six months later and completed almost a year less of education than their peers. Another economist, Seema Jayachandran, found that the fires “led to over 15,600 child, infant and fetal deaths”, hitting the poor especially hard. Indonesia’s fires keep coming back, as does its haze. School closures, business losses and flight cancellations due to air quality are now routine. In 2015, another bad year, the plume from Indonesia’s fires stretched from east Africa to the middle of the Pacific. Those fires, feeding largely on dried peat, were also shooting ungodly amounts of previously sequestered carbon into the skies. At the height of the 2015 fire season Indonesia was emitting more greenhouse gas daily than the US. This catastrophe, engulfing the world’s fourth-most populous country in a choking haze and badly exacerbating global heating, would seem to be a story with legs. And yet international coverage of Indonesia’s fires has been sporadic at best. You can find recently published books covering California’s wildfires from virtually every angle: investigative journalism about incarcerated women working as firefighters, an inspiring chronicle of a high-school football team from a burned town, a children’s book about escaping wildfire and an account of Zen practitioners defending their monastery from a blaze. But a search on Amazon turns up only one book published in English about Indonesia’s fires in the past 20 years: an 80-page economist’s assessment of governmental mitigation programmes. The result of this unbalanced coverage is a warped understanding. When we think of how humanity is kindling fires, we think of global heating, which is the sum of our energy use in general. Our “burning planet” becomes an existential crisis, linked to modernity, rather than one tied to any specific company, activity or governmental scheme. And we think mainly of how fire affects the affluent people whose property is at stake, rather than the poor people whose lives are. Picture a dangerous fire and you’re likely to imagine a thicket of tall trees blazing in a drought-stricken climate. But a more accurate image is smouldering peat or scrub burning by a tropical logging road. The real threat isn’t catching fire, but the slow violence of breathing bad air. You’ve got a hacking cough, your father suffers a stroke and you watch your daughter – short for her age – leave school a year early. Fire is not in itself a bad thing. Many landscapes, built to burn, simply couldn’t exist without regular fires, either natural or intentional. Though foresters once sought to tamp blazes out everywhere, we now recognise that as a grave mistake. A fireproof planet isn’t something we can get, or should even want. It helps to think of fire as like rain. Our world needs precipitation, and some ecosystems even depend on floods. But, as we know, it’s possible to have too little rainfall in one area and too much elsewhere, to see some places parched and others dangerously inundated. Something similar has happened with fire – we’re getting too much and too little at the same time. We badly need a healthier relationship to combustion. Rather than erratic, runaway fires, we need regular, restorative ones, like we used to have. Our forebears didn’t shun flame – they were relentless fire-setters. But they adhered to two important limits. First, they fed their fires with living vegetation, which reclaims lost carbon as it regrows. Second, they were guided by long-acquired experience with fire’s complex paths and consequences. We’ve blasted far past both of those limits. We’re now burning fossilised vegetation, which sends carbon on a one-way trip to the warming atmosphere. And we’re kindling fires that bear little resemblance to the ones we’re used to. There’s no generational wisdom telling us what to do when we drain the peatlands of Central Kalimantan or let dry fuel pile up precariously in the California countryside, all while raising the temperature to hitherto unrecorded heights. Books about fire typically end with prescriptions: we must invest in science, reclaim lost cultural knowledge, burn intentionally, build resiliently and power our grids renewably. All that is true, surely. But given how complex fire is, and how unprecedented nearly everything we’re doing with it is, the best advice would seem to be: slow down. We have scrambled our landscape, changed our energy diet, altered the climate and revised our relationship to flame, all in a very short time. It’s not a surprise that fire, once a useful if obstinate companion to our species, has now slipped our grasp. The world won’t burn up, as we sometimes imagine. But the fires of tomorrow will be different from those of yesterday, and we’re racing headlong into that unsettling future, burning tankfuls of gas as we go.

2/3/2022,"James McAvoy is talking about Cyrano de Bergerac, the long-nosed, lovestruck poet he first played on stage in 2019, and is now about to reprise. But every now and again he interrupts himself with off-piste observations that have nothing to do with 17th-century libertines and doomed love triangles. It slowly becomes clear that he is inside his car, which is parked at the stage door of the Harold Pinter theatre in London, ready to jump into rehearsals after our chat. “What’s this guy doing?” he says, in his meta commentary of people-watching. “Oh my God. There’s a labourer walking down the road and he doesn’t have any trousers on. He’s just in long johns and he has got the biggest penis I think I’ve ever seen.” Wait, how can he tell? “Because he’s wearing long johns! And he’s packing a nine-inch –”  All right, back to Cyrano. How does it feel to return to the loquacious swaggerer? “Partly,” he says, “it makes you feel like two years haven’t happened. Most of the lines were still just there in my head, without me having to worry, which has never happened before. I once sat with Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen and both of them had a ‘Macbeth-off’ where they started speaking Macbeth to each other. I had just finished doing Macbeth and I swear I could not remember a syllable, man. It was awful.” The show is directed by Jamie Lloyd, who dispensed with the idea of “characters” early on in the original run. Instead, he asked the cast to bring themselves to their parts. This, says McAvoy, is what makes it a tricky endeavour: “The show relies on being authentic and you’re two years older now. So you’re slightly different people. Then Jamie went even further and said, ‘I don’t want you guys to wear costumes.’ And we ended up wearing a slightly heightened average of what we all wore a lot of the time.” Lloyd’s production is a daring reconceptualisation, using everything from rap and beat-boxing to poetry slam mics front of stage. Edmond Rostand’s Alexandrine verse has been freely – audaciously – adapted by Martin Crimp, who adds modern parlance and street slang, all of it striking for its intensity and speed of delivery. What’s more, Cyrano’s relationship with Christian – the handsome young lover for whom he writes words, to help him woo the woman they both love – comes with homoerotic edges. What does McAvoy make of these reworkings? “It’s radical in lots of ways but it’s quite classical as well. Martin really sticks to the couplets and rhyme of Rostand’s original, more than a lot of versions. The fact that it sounds like rap at times or poetry slams is partly down to Martin, but also down to the fact that Jamie cast people who create those beats, and for whom spoken-word performance is part of their everyday.” Even the homoeroticism doesn’t seem particularly radical to McAvoy, because it was always nestling in the subtext of the story. “I feel like it’s daft not to explore it when you’re talking about a love triangle. If I had to spend all my time loving a woman through a man who loved her and who loved him back, I would have to love him, too. The fact that it doesn’t get explored in other versions, I think, is about what people want to see and what they are ready for.” And what about the absence of Cyrano’s biggest comic feature? Why no big nose? McAvoy replies: “As soon as Jamie and I said, ‘Let’s do Cyrano,’ he said, ‘I don’t want to do any noses.’ I said, ‘Oh, but it’s about a nose.’ And he said, ‘No it’s not. The first act’s about a nose – but the rest is about objectification.’” After London, the show is transferring to New York but before that it will go to Glasgow, where McAvoy spent his childhood. His parents split up when he was seven, after which his father dropped out of his life. When his mother became ill, McAvoy was sent to live with his grandparents, who partly brought him up. How does it feel to be taking this show home, if Glasgow is still home? “It’s where I was born, where I grew up. I’ve still got a place there and all my family there. I see myself as a Glaswegian and a Londoner – a Glaswegian Londoner.” McAvoy, who is 42, separated from his former wife, Anne-Marie Duff, in 2016, and met the Philadelphian Lisa Liberati on the set of M Night Shyamalan’s thriller Split (Liberati was Shyamalan’s PA). They began a relationship a couple of years later and, he confirms, recently got married. So he’s now an honorary Philadelphian, too, isn’t he? “Yeah, it’s like a second home for me,” he says, but does not want to elaborate on this side of his life for fear of creating tabloid fodder. Acting wasn’t McAvoy’s first or only vocation. He thought about becoming a missionary so he could go to “far flung places”, then almost joined the Royal Navy. He grew up on a council estate but the ambition was to have a big life and broaden his horizons. In the end, he chose to go to drama school, at what is now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, graduating in 2000, and his career didn’t take long to sky-rocket. It hasn’t really come down, with such acclaimed films as The Last King of Scotland and Atonement under his belt, alongside the X-Men blockbusters and the BBC/HBO series His Dark Materials. In 2015, he pledged a significant sum of money to a 10-year scholarship programme at his old drama school. Was that about greater access into the industry? Not really, he says. “I don’t really care if all the people who have been through the scholarship process end up becoming actors or not. It would be a symptom of things getting better if our stages and screens continued to be diverse for the next 40, 50 or 100 years. But being exposed to art at an early age is not about creating artists – it’s about creating better people who are more able to communicate and feel worth something. Art, in all forms, allows you to see beyond your physical confines. If you do that then anything’s possible.” McAvoy has spent the entire pandemic in Britain, taking only UK-based film projects, and co-parenting his 11-year-old son, Brendan. He has done his part to help the NHS, too: in March 2020, he donated £275,000 to a crowdfunding campaign. Having been here throughout the lockdowns, how does he feel about partygate? “I’ve been disappointed in our political system for decades. So the fact that it’s letting us down isn’t a massive shocker.” So he feels disappointed by the system rather than by Boris Johnson? “I think the system relentlessly produces people that disappoint.” As for partygate, he adds: “We’re not even asking that they be held to a higher standard – and they can’t even fucking do that.” McAvoy has spoken about Scottish independence. Does he think Scotland should reach for this now? “The fact that Boris and his company of people who enjoyed a drink while they were telling everybody not to isn’t necessarily something that will make me go, ‘Oh yes, Scottish independence’ – even though he is iconic of an educational and elitist class system that plays into Scottish independence massively. Independence could be a fantastic thing but it needs to be done for the right reasons. Don’t choose it because we don’t like Boris. Choose it because we want it. We can’t just define ourselves by our relationship with England. I’m sick of that.” What about post-pandemic life? Does he feel safe under the new relaxed rules, in theatres particularly? He says he recently contracted the Omicron variant, even after being double-vaccinated and boosted. It put him out of rehearsals for a while. Although there is a risk, he says, there is also the importance of congregating as a society, in which theatre plays a vital part. “Every time you step outside you are taking a risk. But how long can we maintain a society that doesn’t move, that doesn’t connect? If you feel comfortable coming, we’ll see you. If you were a regular theatregoer and you’re not coming, we’ll see you in a couple of years. But if we wait to put on shows until this whole thing is truly over – if that’s ever going to happen – then things like theatre and music might not exist.” McAvoy has sometimes nodded off in the wings, a result of experiencing the same kind of tired tension a boxer might feel before a fight. He did so with Macbeth in London in 2013, which demanded so much, physically and emotionally. But he loved the part and would like to take on more Shakespeare. Maybe Hamlet? “Nah, I’m not that bothered about doing Hamlet. He’s always seemed a bit of a moaner to me.” King Lear? “Yeah, I’d love to, when I’m 100. You can do whatever you want in a production – but I want to feel I’m giving something of myself. So if I’m playing someone on their deathbed, I want to at least feel nearer to it.”  Cyrano de Bergerac is at the Harold Pinter theatre, London, until 12 March, then at Theatre Royal Glasgow, 18 to 26 March, and at Brooklyn Academy of Music from 5 April to 22 May 2022.",Arts/Stage,James McAvoy: ‘Play Hamlet?
