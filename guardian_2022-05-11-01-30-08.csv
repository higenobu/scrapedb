5/11/2022,"When the war started journalists in Ukraine found themselves at the centre of the biggest story in the world. They became war correspondents overnight. Ukrainian journalists were spotlighted this week when the Pulitzer prize board awarded them with a special citation, hailing the country’s reporters for the “courage, endurance and commitment to truthful reporting” they have shown since the Russian invasion. But initially, writing stories and making television reports was secondary for the reporters, editors, and producers who heard explosions around them and scrambled for safety. For more than a month many Ukrainian journalists focused on survival. Some have since returned to work, but often they lack protective equipment and hostile environment training. “Lots of journalists left Kyiv,” said Kristina Berdynskykh, a journalist at one of Ukraine’s major independent publications, Novoye Vremya. “They weren’t thinking about whether they’d be fired, they were just thinking that they had to get their families out.” After the first few days almost all of the staff of Ukraine’s prominent newsrooms fled westwards to Lviv where many remain. Lviv quickly became the new temporary capital when Russian forces surrounded Kyiv. “From the print journalists I know, there was maybe a handful left in Kyiv,” said Berdynskykh. “It is mostly the TV stations who had small teams of war correspondents who had experience in the Donbas. For everyone else, the situation was an absolute shock.” Those who stayed in Ukraine’s hotspots embarked on new careers. Berdynskykh spent 18 nights sleeping on the floor in Kyiv’s metro to avoid the shelling and conducted phone interviews. Without a car or taxis, and with shells flying into the city, in-person interviews were near to impossible for the first month she said. “At first it was practically just western journalists – war correspondents – doing on-the-ground reporting,” said Berdynskykh, who was a leading political reporter but is now focusing on the experiences of ordinary Ukrainians around the country. “But I’m grateful to them because we were still adapting.” Original reporting has since returned to Ukraine’s news sites but most newsrooms cannot afford to simultaneously provide their staff with protective equipment and pay salaries, said Katerina Sergatskova, who founded 24.02 Fund, whose aim is to raise money to help equip reporters and newsrooms with the necessary equipment. The income from online advertising which many Ukrainian news sites relied on dried up when the economy shut down. The demand for protective equipment from Ukrainian journalists has increased as journalists return to work, said Sergatskova. After a month of searching for suppliers, amid a worldwide shortage of bulletproof vests, the 24.02 Fund has now sourced 150 vests and helmets as well as first aid kits and it is working with other organisations to provide first aid training to journalists. Sergatskova, who is a managing editor of Zaborona, another independent Ukrainian publication, fled Kyiv on the seventh day of the war to evacuate her two small children. “When we saw a Russian plane being shot down from our [apartment’s] window, we decided we had to get out,” said Sergatskova. “At first, we took the children to Lviv and then rockets started to hit there, so we took them to live with friends in Europe. Now we can work knowing that they’re safe.” Others, such as Kirill Gonchar in Ukraine’s eastern city of Kharkiv, found themselves even more in the deep end. Gonchar was a creative director of a production company, who shot commercials and promotional videos for newsrooms and businesses before the war. Russian bombs devastated Kharkiv in the first few weeks of the war and the city is still shelled several times a day. When Gonchar realised that Kharkiv’s journalists had either left or could not leave their basements, he ventured out into the city’s streets under shelling to start filming. He said he was almost the only person working on the ground and was soon sending his footage to the BBC, the Associated Press, CNN and others. “I just felt I had to act and this was something I could do,” said Gonchar. “At first I thought I’d make a documentary but then I realised that I just needed to just do news so I could share what was happening.” Gonchar said he started looking for a vest and helmet and writing to people after the first week. But it was only after five weeks of working on the ground that some of his former employers managed to source a vest and helmet for him. Asked how he felt about working without equipment, he said that in some ways he did not know any different. When international journalists started arriving in Kharkiv in late March with full kit, it started to figure more heavily on his mind. “There were several times when I was almost hit,” he said. “One of the houses that my friends and I moved into because it had a basement was completely destroyed by a rocket a week after I moved out. “Those who were in the basement survived,” said Gonchar, whose friends were seriously injured in the attack. “But I can’t say I was scared [to work] because I knew other people had it worse than me.” Since 24 February, at least seven journalists have been killed while working in the field and dozens have been injured, according to Ukraine’s Institute of Mass Information, a media development organisation.",News/World news,‘I had to act’: How Ukrainian journalists became war correspondents overnight,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/i-had-to-act-how-ukrainian-journalists-became-war-correspondents-overnight
5/11/2022,"Gloucester are to seek financial compensation from Worcester following the late postponement of the Premiership fixture between the clubs on 25 March. An independent panel has ruled that Worcester could have done more to field a team despite several squad members being unavailable because of illness and injury. The Warriors pulled out of the game citing a lack of tighthead props and Gloucester were subsequently awarded a 20-0 “victory” and five league points. Following the release of the full reasoned judgment by Sport Resolutions UK, however, Gloucester’s chief executive, Lance Bradley, has made clear the club do not consider the matter entirely closed. “We are pleased the independent panel rejected Worcester’s claims that the cancellation was due to Covid-19 and that they did everything they could to field a team,” Bradley said. “As is evident in the report, clearly neither of these things was the case. The club will now seek compensation from Worcester Warriors through the relevant channels.” While a Worcester official did approach other Premiership club team managers via WhatsApp to request assistance in finding spare props at short notice, the panel found that no phone calls were made and concluded the Warriors had not tried hard enough to obtain loan cover, causing major inconvenience to the host club Gloucester. “The impact of Worcester’s decision to cancel the match was significant across the club and amongst both sets of fans, not least due to doing so within only a few hours of the scheduled kick-off,” Bradley said. “It was frustrating for both sets of fans who had been looking forward to a good game of live rugby, whether at Kingsholm or live on BT Sport, and it was frustrating for our players, coaches and other staff who had been working hard to prepare for the game. “We refunded all match ticket holders, season-ticket holders, box holders and hospitality guests; all of which resulted in significant financial loss for the club. There were also huge financial damages incurred through lost food and drinks sales, not only for Gloucester Rugby, but also for numerous establishments around the city.” Round 1 9/10/11 December 2022 Round 2 16/17/18 December 2022 Round 3 13/14/15 January 2023 Round 4 20/21/22 January 2023 Round of 16 31 March/ 1/2 April 2023 Quarter-finals 7/8/9 April 2023 Semi-finals 28/29/30 April 2023 EPCR Challenge Cup final Friday 19 May 2023 Champions Cup final Saturday 20 May 2023 Next year, meanwhile, the European Champions’ Cup will not feature the two-leg home-and-away round of 16 which proved a popular innovation this season.

5/11/2022,"Prosecutors decided that it was not in the public interest to prosecute an undercover police officer who stole the identity of a dead baby, despite concluding last year that there was enough evidence to bring him to court. The police spy had taken the identity of Rod Richardson and used it when he pretended for three years to be an environmental and anti-capitalist protester. For years, undercover police officers who infiltrated political groups regularly adopted the identities of dead children and used them to construct fake personas in what amounted to common practice in the covert deployments. Police chiefs have been forced to apologise for the use of the technique which has been condemned as being “ghoulish and abhorrent”. The real Rod Richardson had died two days after he was born in 1973. His mother, Barbara Shaw, pursued a long campaign to compel the police to disclose the truth of what had happened. In 2013, political activists and the Guardian exposed Richardson’s undercover mission. At that time, Shaw said: “It’s wrong that someone took Rod’s identity without us knowing … He is still my baby. I’ll never forget him.” Shaw died in May last year – two weeks before her family was informed by the Crown Prosecution Service of its decision. The CPS had initially concluded that there was a realistic prospect of securing a conviction against Richardson on the grounds that he had broken the 1925 Criminal Justice Act by making an untrue statement to obtain a passport. It then decided a prosecution was not in the public interest as Richardson had followed the training and working practices of the undercover unit to which he belonged. The decision was disclosed on Tuesday at the judge-led public inquiry that is examining undercover policing. The inquiry is looking at how 139 undercover police officers spied on more than 1,000 political groups in clandestine operations that started in 1968 and ran for more than four decades. Many of the undercover officers trawled through birth and death certificates to select suitable candidates. They then created aliases based on the details of the dead children and were issued with identity records such as passports, driving licences and national insurance numbers. The inquiry has heard conflicting explanations of why officers and their managers started using the technique in the 1970s. One explanation was they had learned that the Soviet spy agency, the KGB, used this tactic and believed it to be a secure method of creating alter egos. The other is that they had picked up on it after the tactic had been popularised by the author Frederick Forsyth in his 1971 novel, The Day of the Jackal which was made into a film. Richardson is the last undercover officer known to have relied on this technique when he infiltrated leftwing groups between 2000 and 2003. Fiona Murphy, representing six bereaved families, told the inquiry that they were devastated and horrified after learning that the identities of their dead children had been stolen by police spies. She said the undercover officers “developed practices that were the stuff of spy novels and movies, and the managers presided over that operation without regard for morality or legality”. The inquiry is currently hearing two weeks’ of public evidence that centres on the conduct of the managers who supervised the undercover operations between 1968 and 1982.",News/UK news,"Police spy who stole identity of dead baby was not prosecuted, inquiry hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/police-spy-who-stole-identity-of-dead-baby-was-not-prosecuted-inquiry-hears
5/11/2022,"The judgment of the markets was swift and brutal. Currency traders took one look at what the Bank of England was predicting for the UK economy and launched a sustained attack on the pound. It was noon last Thursday when Threadneedle Street announced it was expecting that a 40-year high of more than 10% for the annual inflation rate would coincide with a shrinking economy. Bank governor Andrew Bailey told a press conference he wasn’t keen on the term stagflation – considering it imprecise. But the parallels with the 1970s were precise enough to trigger sharp losses for sterling. By the end of the day in London, the pound had lost two and a half cents against the US dollar. By UK standards, what has happened in the past few weeks qualifies as a wobble rather than a full-blown crisis of the sort that forced sterling off the Gold Standard in 1931 or out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism by speculators led by George Soros on Black Wednesday 30 years ago this year. Nor was the sell-off as serious as that seen in 1976, the crisis that persuaded the then Labour government to ask for financial support from the International Monetary Fund. For the pound’s current weakness to become as legendary as 1931, 1976, 1992 or the postwar devaluations of 1949 and 1967, it would have to fall from today’s level of about $1.23 against the US dollar to parity, where £1 buys $1. Even so, sterling’s weakness has implications. Stephen King, senior economic adviser at HSBC, thinks there is a risk of a feedback loop whereby the fall in the value of sterling adds to inflationary pressure by making imports dearer, and the evidence of higher inflation then leads to a renewed drop in the value of the pound. Sterling, King says, is in the sights of the “vigilantes” – investors who look around the world for the weakest currencies and then attack them. Part of the recent fall in the value of the pound has been due to the strength of the dollar, which always tends to attract support in times of trouble. Since the start of the year, the reasons to be nervous have mounted: the impact of the Omicron strain, China’s zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine. Ominously, though, in recent weeks the pound has been weak not just against the US dollar but against the euro and other currencies such as the Australian dollar. Nick Parsons, head of research at the impact investment firm ThomasLloyd, said: “The UK is set for the slowest growth in the G7. It is going to have the highest inflation in the G7. It has the greatest political uncertainty. That’s a pretty unpleasant combination.” The recent sell-off in sterling came despite the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee raising interest rates at a fourth successive meeting. Traditionally, dearer borrowing costs make a currency more attractive to investors, but that was not true this time. The reason was simple. Financial markets had been expecting interest rates to be raised to 2.5% by this time next year, but the threat of recession meant the Bank pushed back against that idea. With markets not entirely clear whether the MPC is more worried about growth or inflation, sterling is now lower than it was before rates were first raised late last year. Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist at Netwealth and one of Bailey’s rivals to be Bank governor, says: “At this rate a self-made sterling crisis could be next. Having wrongly eased aggressively when growth was recovering and inflation was rising last year, the Bank now continues to hike as it forecasts a sharp slowdown and likely recession ahead.” A lower pound has its consolations. It will attract American tourists back to the UK and make UK exports more competitive on global markets. Conversely, imports and foreign holidays will be more expensive. Parsons says any short-term boost to the pound is likely to prove temporary. “What would lead to a sterling rally? Aggressive rate hikes from the Bank of England? That’s not going to happen. Faster economic growth? You can rule that out. A big increase in exports? Dream on.”",News/Business,"Weak pound could add to UK inflation, say economists",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/weak-pound-could-add-to-uk-inflation-say-economists

5/11/2022,"Just five runners go to post for the Musidora Stakes at York on Wednesday but the field includes two of the first four fillies in the Oaks betting – Emily Upjohn and Life Of Dreams – as well as The Algarve, a potential improver from the Aidan O’Brien stable, which supplied last year’s 14-1 winner, Snowfall. O’Brien has carried all before him in the Epsom Classic trials over the last 10 days, and while The Algarve has yet to race outside maiden company, the fact she is a daughter of Imagine, the 2001 Oaks winner, will also catch the eye of many punters. This looks like a strong renewal of the Musidora, however, and the unbeaten fillies Emily Upjohn and Life Of Dreams have as much scope for improvement and stronger form already in the book. Life Of Dreams, from the Charlie Appleby yard, won a Newbury maiden with ease on debut in mid-April but the clear form horse for Wednesday’s feature event is Emily Upjohn (3.35), who defied a penalty to win by nearly 10 lengths at Sandown last month. Frankie Dettori suggested that John and Thady Gosden’s filly had the “wow factor” afterwards, and the current joint-favourite for the Oaks – with O’Brien’s Tuesday – could well be the clear market leader by Wednesday evening. York 1.50: Gaassee arrives with a similar profile to Ilaraab, who landed this competitive handicap for William Haggas on his seasonal debut 12 months ago. The form of his easy five-length defeat of Trevolli at Kempton in December was franked when the runner-up went on to win his next three starts, so a 9lb rise may not be enough to hold him back. Newton Abbot 2.05: Tulin was below his best last time out in December but has an obvious chance on earlier form and is back after a wind op on a 4lb lower mark. Newton Abbot: 1.00 Jean Genie, 1.30 My Lady Grey, 2.05 Tulin, 2.35 Oxwich Bay, 3.10 Noahthirtywored, 3.45 Rosy Redrum, 4.20 Wotzizname.

York 2.25: Just Frank should give the low-numbered stalls a useful tow into the race with Mr Wagyu in close pursuit. John Quinn’s gelding was much improved last year when his five wins included a victory over this course and distance. He has eased slightly in the handicap and should be spot on for this after a promising reappearance in a strong race at Newmarket’s Guineas meeting. York 3.00: There is a distinct air of unfinished business around Minzaal, who has made just three appearances since a deeply impressive success in the Gimcrack Stakes over course and distance in August 2020. A leg injury kept him on the sidelines for much of his three-year-old season but he returned to finish third in the Group One sprint on Champions Day in October and can start making up for lost time here. York 4.10: Samburu, the likely favourite at around 7-4, has obvious potential but an opening mark of 88 is high enough on his bare form to date so Code Purple is an interesting each-way option at around 12-1. He got his recent win in the stewards’ room but fully deserved to be awarded the race, having confirmed the improvement he showed on his three-year-old debut at Pontefract in early April.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Emily Upjohn can prevail in strong Musidora renewal,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/10/talking-horses-emily-upjohn-can-prevail-in-strong-musidora-renewal

5/11/2022,"Survivors of the brutal regime of the late Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos have described his son’s apparent landslide presidential election victory as the product of trickery and disinformation, warning it is unlikely the billions stolen by his family will be recovered, and that human rights in the country will be weakened. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr had won more than 30.8m votes in a highly divisive presidential election by Monday, according to an unofficial count. His vote tally is more than double that of his closest challenger, the human rights lawyer and current vice-president, Leni Robredo, who had campaigned based on transparency and good governance. Marcos said he would bridge political divides in his country, urging people: “Judge me not by my ancestors, but by my actions.” His message has not convinced survivors who were tortured, imprisoned, or whose relatives were killed, during his father’s 20-year rule. Nor is it likely to win over critics who want the family to return the vast sums it took from state coffers. As much as $10bn was plundered. The Marcos family and its supporters have attempted to rebrand the rule of Marcos Sr as a golden era of peace and prosperity. Social media has been flooded with false claims relating to the family and its opponents, prompting media and academics to begin factchecking initiatives. Bonifacio Ilagan, convener of Campaign Against the Return of the Marcoses and Martial Law, said Marcos Jr’s calls for unity were “empty and self-serving for as long as he does not address the basic questions concerning his father’s dictatorship, of which he was very much a part”. Ilagan was tortured and imprisoned as a student, and his sister was disappeared.“I for one – and I think I can represent a lot – will never accept a president who continues to be the chief administrator of an estate that embodies plunder,” Ilagan said. On Tuesday in Manila, crowds, many wearing black, gathered in front of Commission on Elections office to protesting against the return of the Marcoses, alleging cheating and questioning why results had appeared so quickly. Election officials have rejected claims of rigging and said results were processed more quickly than in previous years because equipment had been upgraded. The results were in line with the findings of opinion surveys conducted by pollsters in the run-up to the election. Activists say that, either way, Marcos did not conduct his campaign fairly. “He flooded social media with historical distortions and refused to engage the media to answer the painful questions that we wanted him to address,” said Ilagan, who said the campaign was based on “trickery and historical distortions”. Although Marcos Jr has denied the existence of any organised online campaign, he was the overwhelming beneficiary of false claims circulating on social media. The majority of disinformation was either designed to undermine Robredo’s reputation or enhance the images of the Marcoses, according to analysis by the factchecking coalition Tsek.ph, which monitored disinformation in the run-up to the election. Cristina Palabay, the secretary general of Karapatan, a human rights NGO, said Marcos and his running mate, Sara Duterte, the daughter of the outgoing president, Rodrigo Duterte, “represent the worst brand of traditional politics and governance in our nation’s history”. “Under Duterte, the human rights crisis has spiralled with extrajudicial killings, arrests and detention, forcible evacuation and other human rights violations, including violations on press freedom and freedom of association,” Palabay said. Marcos has said he will not allow prosecutors of the international criminal court to visit the Philippines to investigate Duterte’s “war on drugs”, shielding him from prosecution. Survivors of the Marcos regime fear public understanding of the period, already distorted by online misinformation, will be further damaged. “Although there are efforts now to try to put the correct version in the textbooks of the children, I don’t think that’s going to be continued,” said Doris Nuval, who was imprisoned for nearly five years under Marcos, the longest of any female political prisoner at the time. “It’s just a sad fact that the young Filipinos will never learn of what’s happened until after his term.” “[Marcos Jr] has absolutely no concept of human rights,” added Nuval.",News/World news,Philippines election: torture survivors from Marcos era in shock after son’s win,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/philippines-election-torture-survivors-from-marcos-sr-era-in-shock-after-sons-win
5/11/2022,"The first memoir by Bono will be released this year, publisher Penguin Random House has announced. While the U2 frontman’s career has been written about extensively, this will mark the first time Bono has written about it himself. Titled Surrender, the autobiography will span the singer’s early days growing up in Dublin, including the sudden loss of his mother when he was 14, the success of U2 and his activist work fighting against Aids and poverty. Surrender will contain 40 chapters, each named after a U2 song. Bono has also created 40 original drawings for the book. A video, in which Bono narrates an extract from the memoir, has been released across U2’s digital platforms. It uses animations based on Bono’s drawings to illustrate an extract from the Out of Control chapter, which is about how he wrote U2’s first single on his 18th birthday, exactly 44 years ago today. Bono said his intention was that the book would “draw in detail what [he’d] previously only sketched in songs. The people, places and possibilities in my life.” He said he chose the title because, having grown up in Ireland in the 1970s, the act of surrendering was not a natural concept to him. Bono, whose lyrics have frequently been inspired by his Christian beliefs, said that “surrender” was “a word I only circled until I gathered my thoughts for the book”. “I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the band, in my marriage, in my faith, in my life as an activist,” he added, describing the book as “the story of one pilgrim’s lack of progress … With a fair amount of fun along the way.” Bono’s book editor Reagan Arthur said that he and his colleagues were “lucky” that the Irish rock star “not only has a dramatic personal history to tell”, but is also “a truly gifted writer”. “Surrender is honest, intimate, irreverent and profound – a dazzling memoir of a remarkable life,” he said. Venetia Butterfield, who is overseeing Surrender’s UK publication, added that the title is “an extraordinary book by an extraordinary man”, promising that it will “delight readers around the world”. Bono, born Paul David Hewson, met The Edge, Larry Mullen Jr and Adam Clayton at school, and they formed U2 in 1976, releasing their first album, Boy, in 1980. Since then, they have released a further 13 studio albums, and their 360° Tour, which ran from 2009 to 2011, remains the second highest-grossing concert band tour of all time. To date, U2 have sold more than 157m albums and won 22 Grammys, more than any other duo or group. Bono is also well-known for his activism. (RED), a campaign he co-founded, has generated more than $700m for the Global Fund to treat and prevent Aids in Africa. In 2016, Bono co-founded the Rise Fund, which invests in companies that are driving positive social and environmental change. Bono has received a number of awards for his music and activism, including Chile’s Pablo Neruda Medal of Honour, the Légion d’honneur from the French government, an honorary British knighthood, the Fulbright prize for international understanding, and Time magazine’s person of the year (along with Bill and Melinda Gates).

5/11/2022,"All the discussion around the results of the Northern Ireland assembly elections and the conditions placed by the DUP on the establishment of a new executive (Northern Ireland elections: what happens next, 7 May) bring to mind the reasons for the situation we are now in. Back in time, Theresa May decided that, even though the pro-Brexit margin in the referendum had been a narrow one, she was going to pursue a hard Brexit that excluded any involvement in a customs union with the EU. She was unable to muster support in the Commons, and there were two attempts by MPs to find a solution on which all could agree. Among these were motions advocating participation in a customs union. This concept, which would have avoided the need for the Irish Sea border, was defeated by margins of six and three votes on those two occasions. And it was defeated because the DUP joined the government in opposing it. If the Northern Ireland protocol, along with all the other impacts of rejecting the customs union (supply chain issues, queues at Dover) had not been so damaging, it would be comical to watch the current antics of the DUP.Chris PiggottHigh Wycombe, Buckinghamshire  My late wife, who lectured on the Florentine Renaissance, told me that there were significant differences in the detail of contracts to paint frescoes, depending on whether the artist was Fra Angelico or Fra Filippo Lippi; the reason was that the former could be trusted not to mix inferior products into the paints he made, while the latter could not. Lisa O’Carroll’s article (UK will do ‘whatever necessary’ to reform Northern Ireland Brexit protocol, says minister, 8 May) on the Northern Ireland protocol reminds me of that. In principle, there can be no problem with goods entering into Northern Ireland from Britain being free of customs checks, provided they are neither going to move to the Republic or elsewhere in the EU, nor going to be components of products that do so. The problem is how that proviso can be verified. In outline, the UK government’s argument is “you can take it on trust from us if we say so” and the EU’s argument is “we need to be able to check everything in detail”.

The prime minister disguises his autocratic powers under the royal prerogative. If it’s his speech, let’s say so and stop pretending the monarch has anything to do with it. We must sever the monarchy from the political system: a democratic imperative that is centuries overdue.Nick InmanLarreule, France  Xenotransplantation “is a real killer”, says your correspondent (Letters, 8 May).

5/11/2022,"Beijing has accused Washington of “political manipulation” and attempting to change the status quo after the US state department quietly amended its website to remove a line stating it did not support Taiwanese independence. In a delicate geopolitical balancing act, the US has long acknowledged, but not supported, China’s claim to Taiwan under its version of the “one China principle”. However, experts say that policy has been eroded as Beijing has become more assertive. In an updated page on the state department’s online “fact sheet” Washington last week removed some key lines from the 1979 US-PRC joint communique. It included a line saying “the US recognised the government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is a part of China”. The line saying the US “does not support Taiwan independence” – which appeared in a previous version published on 31 August 2018 – has also been removed from the website. The new version said theUS “continues to encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait differences consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan”. It added: “The United States has a longstanding one China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three US-China joint communiques, and the six assurances.” Beijing sees Taiwan as a part of China and has vowed to take it back, with force if necessary. On Tuesday, a spokesperson at the American Institute in Taiwan – the US’s de-facto embassy on the island – said Washington’s commitment to Taipei was “rock solid”, and that it “contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region”. On the same day, Beijing criticised the change. A foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, called the edit “an act of political manipulation and an attempt to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, which will backfire and the US itself will get burned”. The edits took place on 5 May, the state department’s website showed. The latest fact sheet on Taiwan begins with the line that “as a leading democracy and a technological powerhouse, Taiwan is a key US partner in the Indo-Pacific”. The state department also said that the US and Taiwan “share similar values, deep commercial and economic links, and strong people-to-people ties”. It is not immediately clear if recent changes to the fact sheet reflected the Biden administration’s latest policy on China. Anthony Blinken, the secretary of state, was scheduled to deliver a major speech last week laying out the government’s framing on China. The activity was cancelled due to Blinken’s Covid test results. Tensions between Washington and Beijing over the island of Taiwan have continued to rise since Biden became US president last year. In January, Qin Gang, the Chinese envoy to the US, warned the two countries could face a “military conflict” over the future of Taiwan, in an unusually explicit reference to the prospect of war.",News/World news,Beijing accuses US of ‘political manipulation’ in latest Taiwan row,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/beijing-accuses-us-of-political-manipulation-in-latest-taiwan-row
5/11/2022,"Rugby league’s governing bodies in the UK have agreed a groundbreaking 12-year strategic partnership deal with the global media brand IMG to revolutionise the sport’s long-term prospects. The Rugby Football League and Super League have been in discussions about a new joint-venture company for almost a year, with the end goal finding a third party that could maximise the sport’s growth. That process has now reached a conclusion with IMG, one of the most recognisable sporting and events brands in the world, joining forces with the sport. Rugby league has not sold any of its assets or competition rights to the brand, with IMG instead coming on board as a strategic partner to help deliver improvements on everything from digital transformation to competition restructuring and the distribution of the game’s media rights. IMG will be central to a new commercial arm of the sport that will drive all event, marketing and sponsorship rights. That will enable the RFL and Super League to focus on its own on-field competition matters. “Rugby league is loved for its thrilling, fast-paced action and we see tremendous potential to further energise the sport and its competitions in the UK, engage with fans on a deeper level and drive long-term growth,” said the co-president of IMG, Adam Kelly. “We are excited to embark on this long-term partnership with the RFL and Super League and look forward to utilising IMG and Endeavor’s [IMG’s holding company] unparalleled expertise, experience and global network to create and add value for rugby league and its commercial partners.” The chairman of Super League, Ken Davy, said: “Over the last 18 months, Super League has focused on analysing and defining the future of the competition, with two key elements being identified. These were to grow commercial revenues in a realignment with the RFL and the other was to find a strategic partner. “We consulted widely on the strategic partner to find someone who bought into our vision for the Super League competition and the sport of rugby league as a whole. In IMG we have a world-renowned partner that has all the requisite strengths to ensure the sport’s continued growth and development.”",Sport/Sport,Super League and RFL announce 12-year deal with media giant IMG,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/10/super-league-rfl-12-year-deal-img-rugby-league
