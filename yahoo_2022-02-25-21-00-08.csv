Former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told CNN he was in ""disbelief"" over some Republicans' support for Russian President Vladimir Putin during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. When asked about former President Donald Trump's recent praise for Putin, Kelly told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday that he doesn't ""get it."" ""[Putin] is a tyrant. He's a murderer. He has attacked an innocent country whose only crime is that they want to be free and democratic and they're working in that direction and have been working in that direction,"" Kelly said. ""Is Putin smart?"" he added. ""Yes. I mean, tyrants are smart. They know what they're doing. But … I can't imagine why someone would look at what's happening there and see it [as] anything other than a criminal act."" Kelly, who served as Trump's chief of staff from 2017 to 2019, did not mention his former boss by name. You can watch the interview below: Russia attacked Ukraine early Thursday morning after stationing hundreds of thousands of troops at its border. Explosions pounded cities across Ukraine, including its capital Kyiv. In the last few weeks, Trump and many other leading conservative figures, including Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, had praised Putin as he threatened the attack. Trump told the ""Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show"" on Tuesday that Putin's justification for invading Ukraine was ""savvy"" and ""genius."" In an interview with the Center for the National Interest last week, Trump's former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, also expressed ""enormous respect"" for Putin.

2/25/2022,"Few places conjure more foreboding than Chernobyl, the site of the deadly 1986 nuclear disaster. So alarm bells rang in the West when Russian forces seized the decommissioned power plant in the early hours of their invasion of Ukraine on Thursday. Why would Russia make a radioactive wasteland one of its very first targets in Ukraine? While the full answer may be known only to top officials in Moscow, the site happens to lie along one of the most direct paths to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. “The location is important because of where it sits,” retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commanding general of U.S. Army Europe, said in an interview. ""If Russian forces were attacking Kyiv from the north, Chernobyl is right there on the way, almost in the way."" Chernobyl is less than 10 miles from Ukraine's border with Belarus, a Russian ally where Moscow has been massing troops in preparation for its attack. From there, it's a relatively straight shot of about 80 miles south to Kyiv. The route from Belarus to Kyiv through Chernobyl might be particularly appealing to Russian military planners because it would allow them to cross the Dnieper River in Belarus, avoiding a potentially hazardous crossing of the major river, which bisects Ukraine, behind enemy lines. ""They want it because they want to take control of the whole effing country,"" said Evelyn Farkas, who was deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia in the Obama administration. ""They want to surround the capital."" A large ""exclusion zone"" surrounds the damaged reactor at Chernobyl and the abandoned nearby city of Pripyat, where workers have spent years painstakingly dismantling the former power plant and cleaning up radioactive debris. After the 1986 explosion, a radioactive cloud drifted across much of Europe. The radioactivity of the area around the plant has decreased in the decades since the disaster, and studies have found thriving wild animal populations in the exclusion zone, despite contamination in the soil, according to the World Nuclear Association. Recent fighting in the area this week could stir up contaminated soil and other debris, raising concerns about the possibility of harmful environmental impacts that could spread far beyond the grounds. Farkas said that even if Russian President Vladimir Putin has no interest in the decommissioned plant itself, Moscow would want to secure the facility, especially with the potential for a protracted fight with Ukrainian insurgents if Russia proceeds to occupy the country. ""They certainly don’t want loose nuclear material floating around,"" she said. ""They understand the danger there."" The Soviet Union built the Chernobyl plant when it controlled Ukraine, and many view the 1986 disaster there as a contributing factor to fall of the former superpower a few years later. The disaster has been a subject of historical revisionism in the decades since then as Putin and his allies try to recast the Soviet Union in a more positive light. After the popularity of a 2019 HBO miniseries about Chernobyl, which portrayed the disaster as a product of Soviet mismanagement, a Kremlin-backed TV network ran its own series blaming the CIA. Undamaged reactors at the plant continued producing power for Ukraine until 2000, when the plant was shut down for good. “It’s a useless piece of real estate,” said a congressional aide who has been briefed by U.S. officials. “But if you want to take Kyiv fast, you go through Chernobyl.”",World/NBC News,Why would Russia want to take Chernobyl?,https://news.yahoo.com/why-russia-want-chernobyl-220627131.html

2/25/2022,"As Ukraine buckles under Russia’s brutal invasion, sparking the worst military bloodshed on European territory since the end of World War II, European leaders are haggling over sanctions, making sure being tough won’t hurt their own economies too much in the process. Hours after the invasion began on Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised “massive” sanctions that would cripple Russia’s financial standing. But it was soon clear that Russia’s tentacles are so deeply embedded in Europe’s strongest economies, that punishing Putin will come at a high price. Italy has asked that luxury goods so dear to Russian oligarchs to be excluded, Germany pushed for an exemption on the energy sector before eventually halting Nord Stream 2 certification but on Thursday refused to agree to block Russia from the SWIFT bank payment system. Other countries, including Hungary, dug in hard to block the toughest sanctions on the table. Former President of the European Council Donald Tusk tweeted an angry missive to European leaders who have so far blocked the sanctions. “In this war everything is real: Putin’s madness and cruelty, Ukrainian victims, bombs falling on Kyiv,” he wrote Friday. “Only your sanctions are pretended. Those EU government’s, which blocked tough decisions (i.a. Germany, Hungary, Italy) have disgraced themselves.” These Nerds Saw Ukraine Invasion Start On Google Maps Before Putin Said a Word After negotiations failed to produce the “massive sanctions” promised on Thursday, European leaders will go back to the negotiation table on Friday, likely adopting what is referred to as an “incrementalist” approach even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told them he may not speak to them again because Russian special agents are out to assassinate him. “He told us he doesn’t know whether he will be able to speak with us another time so it’s tough,” Luxembourg prime minister Xavier Bettel said Friday, according to Reuters. “We have to know how serious the situation is in Ukraine.” On Friday, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi told reporters he was fearful for the Ukraine leader. “Zelenskyi told us that he is hiding somewhere and that Ukraine has no more time,” Draghi said according to a tweet by a reporter. “He was supposed to attend a phone call at 9.30am but he couldn’t make it.” Among the exclusions many European leaders want to “keep up their sleeves” are visa-free travel to Europe for Russian diplomats and anything that would make it difficult for nations to pay for Russian energy. Massive and targeted sanctions, agreed by EU leaders, will have severe consequences for Russia.These sanctions cover:⛔️The financial sector⛔️The energy and transport sectors⛔️A ban on the export of aircraft spare parts⛔️Access to important technology⛔️Visa policy pic.twitter.com/dp9ktDA8yP — European Commission 🇪🇺 (@EU_Commission) February 25, 2022 Leaders, speaking at the end of Thursday’s talks, admitted punishing Putin was proving difficult. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte told reporters “more work needs to be done to assess what happens if Russia is cut off” with regard to blocking Russia from using SWIFT, as has been suggested by most of the G7 leaders outside Europe. Some sanctions that are likely to go through are limiting Russia’s access to some of Europe’s financial services, and prohibiting the sale of equipment to Russian oil refineries and blocking the sale of European aircraft to Russian airlines. Also on the table are targeting specific oligarchs, like those who own property in Italy, Malta and Spain—and whose super yachts have mostly all suspiciously disappeared from ports in Sardinia and elsewhere, likely moored in friendlier waters. One unnamed EU diplomat expressed frustration with his colleagues to the Financial Times. “The question is, what are we waiting for on the other sanctions?” he said. “If we can’t do Swift, can’t we at least not be slow on oligarchs?” Read more at The Daily Beast.
