3/22/2022,"A Senate committee has recommended against legislation to stop ministers vetoing grant funding, despite strong support for the bill from the academic and research community. The education and employment legislation committee, chaired by Nationals senator Matt Canavan, has recommended against passing a Greens private member’s bill that would amend the Australian Research Council Act 2001. The bill would prevent ministers from vetoing projects that have been recommended for funding by the Australian Research Council (ARC). A Senate inquiry was launched after widespread condemnation of a decision by the acting education minister, Stuart Robert, to block funding for six ARC research grants in the humanities. The inquiry heard on 9 March that ministerial vetoes had a “chilling effect” on academic independence and was making it harder to attract international research talent to Australia. An inquiry report has concluded that the current legislation “serves the national interest”, but concedes that the ARC Act “may no longer be fit for purpose” and may need to be amended in light of “broader concerns about the ARC and its governance and research funding processes”. The only Greens senator on the committee, Mehreen Faruqi, said government and Labor members had “teamed up” to oppose the bill and “disregard overwhelming evidence in support of it”. Faruqi said: “Despite an overwhelming majority of contributors supporting the removal of the veto, the committee majority have relied selectively on evidence provided by a very small number of witnesses.” “Politics has trumped good policymaking as both the government and Labor have refused to concede their political power to interfere with individual research grants,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A dissenting Greens statement said the process of drafting the report had been “utterly flawed, undemocratic, a breach of due process, and completely lacking in transparency”, and that “no time was allowed for discussion of proposed Greens amendments”. The statement said: “Of the more than 80 submissions received by the committee, the overwhelming and clear majority, that is more than 85%, are in support of removing the ministerial veto. “The position of researchers, experts, academics, peak bodies and many universities is also clear from the evidence provided during the hearing held by the committee, where the vast majority of witnesses argued for the removal of the ministerial veto.” Labor senators said they did not support the bill, despite “strong concerns about the way in which coalition government education ministers have arbitrarily exercised their power to veto grants”. Labor committee members instead recommended that the ARC Act be amended to require that ministers table within 15 parliamentary sitting days the “reasons, evidence and advice received” for any grant veto decision made. A broad independent review of the ARC was required, they added, which should “go to the issue of the ARC’s role in the research system, including the operations of the ARC”.",News/Australia news,Federal bill to prevent ministers vetoing research grants rejected by Senate committee,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/federal-bill-to-prevent-ministers-vetoing-research-grants-rejected-by-senate-committee
3/22/2022,"Former New South Wales deputy premier John Barilaro was “broken” and “wanted to hide” during the state’s Delta outbreak due to the abuse from members of the public that followed a series of Friendlyjordies videos, a defamation trial has heard. On Tuesday, Barilaro took the stand in his case against tech giant Google over a series of videos made by the YouTube comedian Jordan Shanks, who uses the nom de plume Friendlyjordies, in late 2020. Barilaro told the court about his “anger” at Google for refusing to take down videos at the centre of the case despite repeated requests from his staff, and recalled telling his staff he was contemplating self-harm after receiving significant online abuse. “I was in a dark place,” Barilaro told the court. “The pile on, pile on, pile on, pile on. It’s hard to admit to your friends how you’re feeling [but] I did say those things and I’ve thought about those things often. “When you’re away from your family in your apartment in Sydney, up late at night deleting abusive comments [online], I tell you what, you start looking at the balcony for a way out.” Barilaro launched legal action against both Shanks and Google, the owner of YouTube, over two videos titled bruz and Secret Dictatorship, claiming they were “vile and racist” and brought him into “public disrepute, odium, ridicule and contempt”. The claim against Shanks was settled in November last year, with Shanks apologising for any hurt caused, editing parts of two videos and paying legal costs but not damages. In his apology, Shanks accepted that some of the videos he posted were “offensive to Mr Barilaro”, his lawyer, Matthew Collins QC, told the federal court last year. However, the case against Google has continued. On Tuesday, Barilaro told the court that statements in the Friendlyjordies videos including repeated use of the words “wog”, “greasy” and “slimeball” made him feel as if he was at school where, he said, he suffered racist abuse because of his Italian heritage. “For a moment there I felt like nothing’s moved on,” he told the court. “Racism still exists. [We] talk about the migrant story and how great immigration has been for this country [but] we were called ‘wogs’ or ‘dagos’ or ‘garlic breath’ because we ate salami and olives. I felt like life had just gone back to where I was when I was a young boy. “You can use comedy in a way to highlight the differences of our heritage and culture and that happens in other cultures, and it can be done in a way that’s not offensive, but look at the way he used the word ‘wog’. “I grew up with the word ‘wog’ and ‘dago’. I used to go to school in primary school and would start the day in a punch-up because I was called a ‘wog’.” “Anyone who wants to use the word ‘wog’ and think it doesn’t offend, well ‘wog’ was not used as a term of an endearment, I grew up with that.” Barilaro made no secret of his anger at the tech company for refusing to apologise for the videos, despite having dropped the majority of its defences days before the trial was due to begin. “I hate Google,” he told the court. “If they can’t see these videos for what they are, well then there’s something bloody wrong with corporate Australia or corporate America or corporations.” An at times emotional Barilaro gave evidence that he had been the subject of intense abuse by members of the public following the videos, including a series of public confrontations which left him fearing for his family’s safety. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Barilaro told the court that in early 2021 he was at a shopping centre in Sydney’s eastern suburbs with his young daughter when a man approached him and asked whether he was the deputy premier. “I’m always polite and said ‘yes’, and he said ‘you’re a corrupt piece of shit’,” he told the court. Describing the man as “very aggressive” Barilaro said his daughter, who is six, “held on to my leg” and was clearly afraid. “I said, ‘I’m with my daughter, can you bugger off’. I might have used stronger language than that. [But] this was beyond me being stalked or attacked, it could impact on my family,” he said. On another occasion, Barilaro said, he had been drinking in a bar with staff when an intoxicated man “started abusing me, [calling me] a corrupt piece of shit”. “He got really confrontational and aggressive,” Barilaro said. “This guy was going to punch-on, no doubt, he wasn’t just happy to abuse me.” The trial continues.",News/Australia news,John Barilaro tells court he felt ‘broken’ after Friendlyjordies videos appeared on YouTube,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/john-barilaro-tells-court-he-felt-broken-after-friendlyjordies-videos-appeared-on-youtube
3/22/2022,"Hundreds of children have been detained by the Myanmar military since it seized power more than one year ago, with many held ransom by soldiers and police who are seeking to arrest their relatives, according to a minister of the country’s National Unity Government. Naw Susanna Hla Hla Soe, minister of Women, Youths and Children Affairs Ministry in the NUG, which was formed last year by elected lawmakers to challenge the junta, said 287 children under the age of 18 had been detained since 1 February 2021. Most had been held in police station detention centres, and some in prisons. A further 80 school children aged under 12 were detained for about 36 hours at a Buddhist monastery in Yinmabin Township in Sagaing Region, according to local media reports last month. The area was targeted by the military as it sought members of the armed resistance. The whereabouts of children taken by the military since the coup is mostly unknown, according to Naw Susanna Hla Hla Soe. She referred to the detention of Dr Htar Htar Lin, the former head of Myanmar’s Covid vaccination programme, who was taken by the military in June 2021 along with her husband, seven-year-old son and their family dog. Dr Htar Htar Lin was targeted because she had returned 168 million kyat ($US94,580) in funding to the UN, preventing it from being seized by the military. Her family’s location is still unknown, said the minister. “[The children] are doing nothing wrong, but the military tried to arrest the activist and also NLD members and the political activists,” said Naw Susanna Hla Hla Soe, referring to Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, National League for Democracy. “When they could not find the people, they arrested the children as a ransom. They also ask the activist to come and be arrested so that this child will be released,” she said. Parents face an impossible choice, fearing they, or older relatives, could be killed if they come forward. “So many parents are heartbroken people. The children were arrested but they couldn’t do nothing because they have to run for their lives,” she said. A previous estimate by Unicef suggested hundreds more young adults have also been detained. It said last year that about 1,000 children and young people aged up to 25 years old had been held by the military without apparent reason. Naw Susanna Hla Hla Soe spoke to the Guardian while in hiding inside Myanmar, where she continues her work for the NUG, which comprises elected lawmakers, ethnic minority representatives and activists. The NUG, which has been labelled a “terrorist” group by the junta, has sought to gain international recognition as Myanmar’s legitimate government. The UN General Assembly last year deferred a decision on who should take the country’s seat, allowing representative Kyaw Moe Tun, a critic of the junta, to remain in place. In the wake of the coup, Naw Susanna Hla Hla Soe stayed with doctors, wearing a medical coat to avoid detection. She eventually travelled to an area of the country that is controlled by an ethnic armed group that supports pro-democracy activists. Like many civilians, she has faced the continued threat of airstrikes, and suffered from dehydration and diarrhoea due to the conditions in which she has been forced to seek shelter. The military has unleashed a campaign of terror on the public in order to crush a pro-democracy movement that continues to oppose its rule. At least 1,600 people have been killed by security forces since the coup, according to the UN. More than 12,800 have been arrested, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma), an advocacy group that tracks detentions. Naw Susanna Hla Hla Soe also raised concern over the military’s use of sexual violence against those who oppose the coup, but said data is hard to gather. It was young people, she said, who were leading the struggle for democracy in the face of such brutality. Many have taken up arms in response to military violence, while others are using peaceful forms of protest to disrupt the junta. Their fight was not about supporting Aung San Suu Kyi or her party, but was driven by a determination not to “go back to the dark age”, and by a desire to rid Myanmar of age-old discrimination – against ethnic minorities as well as on the basis of age or gender, said Naw Susanna Hla Hla Soe. She referred to apologies made by young protesters, who have said they should have done more to support the Rohingya, who received little public sympathy when they were subject to a brutal campaign of violence by the military in 2017. UN investigators later said the violence was carried out with “genocidal intent”. Naw Susanna Hla Hla Soe, previously an NLD lawmaker, has made a similar apology. Older politicians should follow the lead of young people, she added. “My opinion is that [young people] are fighting in this revolution to completely tear down the military dictatorship and to end the old-established discriminations based on gender, age, skin colour, race and religion. The dictators are abusing nationalism to promote hate between us to preserve their status quo. We are fed up with them and we won’t be divided any more. They can’t divide us any more. We’re going to turn the system upside down.” Translation by Lone Lone",News/Global development,"Hundreds of children detained by the Myanmar military, minister says",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/22/hundreds-of-children-detained-by-the-myanmar-military-minister-says
3/22/2022,"Russia’s false accusation that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons is a “clear sign” that a desperate Vladimir Putin is considering using them himself, Joe Biden has said. The US president said Putin’s “back is against the wall and now he’s talking about new false flags he’s setting up including, asserting that we in America have biological as well as chemical weapons in Europe – simply not true. I guarantee you,” Biden said at an event on Monday. “They are also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine. That’s a clear sign he’s considering using both of those. He’s already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful of what’s about to come.” Putin “knows there’ll be severe consequences because of the united Nato front,” he said, without specifying what actions the alliance would take. The remarks echo previous comments by officials in Washington and allied countries, who have accused Russia of spreading an unproven claim that Ukraine had a biological weapons program as a possible prelude to potentially launching its own biological or chemical attacks. Biden spoke after the Pentagon said it had seen “clear evidence” Russian forces were committing war crimes and that it was helping collect evidence. Last week, the US president said he thought Putin was a “war criminal”, as well as a “murderous dictator” and “thug”, comments the Russian foreign ministry said were “unworthy of a state figure of such a high rank” and risked rupturing US-Russian ties. The UN’s international court of justice has already ordered Moscow to halt its invasion, and a prosecutor at the international criminal court has launched a war crimes investigation. On Monday night, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy again urged direct talks with Putin, saying: “Without this meeting it is impossible to fully understand what they are ready for in order to stop the war.” He also said his country will never bow to ultimatums from Russia and cities directly under attack, including the capital, Kyiv, and Mariupol and Kharkiv would not accept Russian occupation. In other developments: Biden talked to the leaders of the UK, France, Germany and Italy on Monday as part of his effort to maintain a unified front to Moscow, amid signs of cracks within the EU on how far to go in imposing sanctions on Russian oil and gas. Earlier in the day, Biden warned the US business community of intelligence pointing to a growing Russian cyber threat and urging companies to “immediately” prepare defences. “It’s part of Russia’s playbook” in response to sanctions, he said Almost 10,000 Russian soldiers may have already been killed in the war in Ukraine, and more than 16,000 wounded, according to defence ministry figures reported in a pro-Kremlin tabloid newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda. Previously, the official death toll was 498. The paper later released a statement claiming it had been hacked. Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, heralded new plans to develop an “EU Rapid Deployment Capacity” that could allow the bloc to swiftly deploy up to 5,000 troops for different types of crises. He insisted a “European army” will not be created. An Associated Press reporter has told the story of the desperate conditions inside the besieged city of Mariupol after spending more than two weeks there, being hunted by Russian soldiers amid the shelling. In Kyiv, a brand new shopping centre was destroyed in a missile attack that killed at least eight people, the largest attack yet on the capital. Here, witnesses tell their story of the destruction of Retroville. Russia’s defence ministry has accused Kyiv, without providing evidence, of planning a chemical attack against its own people in order to accuse Moscow of using chemical weapons in the invasion of Ukraine that began nearly a month ago. Earlier this month, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with Nikolay Patrushev, secretary of Russia’s Security Council, warning him of consequences for “any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine”. The White House did not specify what those consequences would be. Biden also said Russia used a hypersonic missile to destroy a weapons depot on Saturday “because it’s the only thing they can get through with absolute certainty”. An administration official clarified on Monday evening that Biden was confirming Russia’s use of such an advanced missile, but noted that the impact of the attack was unknown. One senior US defence official had earlier raised questions about the legitimacy of the Russian account. Russia’s invasion has largely stalled, failing to capture any major city, but causing massive destruction to residential areas.

3/22/2022,"Wattle has had a cultural use spanning 50,000 years, a study analysing ancient campfires in Australia’s Western Desert has found. The practice of archaeobotany was used by researchers to analyse charcoal preserved in the oldest archaeological site on Martu Country. The research, led by Chae Byrne from the University of Western Australia alongside Martu traditional owners, found Australia’s floral emblem has been integral to Indigenous survival for tools, food and medicine for more than 50,000 years. By examining desert rock shelters in Katjarra (the Carnarvon Ranges) and Karnatukul (Serpents Glen), Byrne found the earliest uses of firewood in the region, confirming wattle had been a constant, dependable source in a harsh environment. “Wattle was critical to the lives of the Martu and essential to the habitability of the arid landscape of the sand plains and rocky ridges of the Western Desert – and it still is,” Byrne said. “We have all grown up looking at the coat of arms and seeing green and gold – it’s so iconic in Australia. But this gives us a deeper meaning … wattle expands through time, it’s a central part of our nation.” More than 100 species of wattle have been used by Aboriginal communities for firewood, to make tools, as food and as medicine. But the study was the first to confirm early Indigenous explorers settled and prospered in the arid part of the Western Desert during harsh changes in climate which saw widespread drought and desertification when polar ice sheets grew. Byrne said preserving areas where wattle was growing was vital to traditional owners’ survival in the region through the extreme climate fluctuations.

Wattle has also been demonstrated to treat aches, pains and infections, most commonly through infusion and smoke treatment. “There is a purpose and significance for every type of tree and bush; an ancient grocer and pharmacy which has provided and prospered for tens of thousands of years,” Byrne said. The research was one of the first times archaeobotany – the practice of using plants in archaeological studies – has been used to examine Australian deserts. In certain conditions, delicate fragments of plant remains can be preserved and survive in the natural environment for thousands of years. By sampling trees currently growing in the region, researchers were able to compare the specimens to ancient charcoal fragments discovered from campfires in the archaeological sites. “Looking at plant remains is particularly useful in studying Australian Indigenous heritage, given the persistent importance of natural resources like trees and the rarity of other cultural remains in the deep time record,” Byrne said. “It shows how they moved through the landscape, how they followed certain areas like watercourses, and then by looking at scattered remains – all that charcoal represents lots of different uses over time and we can reconstruct those environments. “There’s so much we can learn from charcoal, not just about the people that produced it but also in environmental science and climate change.”",News/Australia news,"Wattle used for tools, food and medicine by Western Desert traditional owners for 50,000 years, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/wattle-used-for-tools-food-and-medicine-by-western-desert-traditional-owners-for-50000-years-study-shows
3/22/2022,"The Morrison government failed to follow through on a promised $2m to facilitate consultations with traditional owners over its controversial plan to allow fracking in the Beetaloo Basin, an inquiry has heard. The federal government has handed fracking companies tens of millions of dollars to accelerate exploratory drilling in the basin as part of its “gas-led recovery” from the pandemic, despite evidence that exploiting the region’s gas would drive up Australia’s emissions by 13%. Before production can take place, consent must be secured from traditional owners across the vast area that makes up the Beetaloo. The Northern Land Council, tasked with liaising with traditional owners, told a Senate inquiry on Tuesday that it had been promised $2m from the Morrison government to help it consult over the Beetaloo plan. The money, promised in the last federal budget, had so far failed to materialise, the inquiry heard. In fact, the NLC said it had not even received a draft grant agreement for consideration. “We don’t yet have a funding agreement, we have not yet received a draft agreement for our consideration,” Greg McDonald, the council’s branch manager for resources and energy, said. “This was an announcement that was made at last year’s federal budget, and that’s where the NLC first heard about it, when that public announcement was made.” Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy said: “So we’re coming up to the next budget of the Morrison government, and you’re still waiting on this money, is that right?” McDonald responded: “That’s correct.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The NLC told the inquiry it had already secured consent for exploratory drilling to be conducted in parts of the Beetaloo Basin, but was yet to consult on production more broadly. The inquiry heard that consent was at odds with opposition from a number of traditional owners, including those giving evidence to the Senate inquiry on Tuesday. Ray Dimakarri Dixon, a Mudburra man and traditional owner in the Beetaloo, said the fracking threatened his land and had prompted serious concerns about water, sacred sites, the environment, and his connection to country. “Fracking uses a lot of chemicals underground and that’s what we are worried about,” he told the inquiry. “This is going to contaminate the water and it’s going to make it bad for our children. It doesn’t matter where we are. It doesn’t matter where we live, what colour, what race, what tribe we are. The water is very important for us … it’s life.” “I think we shouldn’t have fracking in our country. They’re using our water. They’re using our sand. It’s going to destroy our future, our culture, everything that we have.” Lock the Gate, an environmentalist group opposed to fracking, on Tuesday released an analysis of the impact of current and proposed exploratory drilling projects in the Beetaloo, based on the environmental management plans released by proponent companies. It found the exploration activities will use 2,272m litres of water and more than 1m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. The gas industry peak group, Australian Petroleum Exploration and Production Association, told the inquiry that opening up the Beetaloo would create thousands of jobs and increase the supply of gas to both domestic and export markets. “This is both an export and domestic opportunity,” APPEA chief executive, Andrew McConville, said. The inquiry heard concerns about the way traditional owners were treated during consultations over fracking. GetUp’s first nations justice director, Larissa Baldwin, said there were instances where traditional owners were not afforded due and proper process, despite fracking companies claiming they had secured consent through the NLC or Central Land Council. “We’ve heard from traditional owners time and time again that on many occasions there has been no process of informed consent,” she said. “Meetings without translators provided, no detailed description of what will occur, where they will drill and [conduct] production, no information about the long-term impact and the risk to water, health, and cultural heritage.” “The communities are not willing to trust these companies on their words.”",News/Australia news,"Beetaloo traditional owners yet to be consulted on production of fracking gas, Senate inquiry hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/beetaloo-traditional-owners-yet-to-be-consulted-on-production-of-fracking-gas-senate-inquiry-hears
3/22/2022,"New South Wales Premier Dominic Perrottet has demanded the resignation of independent New South Wales MP Gareth Ward after he was charged by police over allegations of sexual abuse of a man and a 17-year-old boy. Police confirmed the member for Kiama had on Tuesday been charged with three counts of assault with acts of indecency, and one count each of common assault and sexual intercourse without consent. In a statement, Ward denied the charges and says he looks forward to proving his innocence in court. Ward stepped down from his role as the minister for families in May last year, and left the Liberal party room to join the crossbench, after he revealed he was the subject of a police investigation. He said at the time he had not been contacted by police and denied any wrongdoing. Police will allege Ward indecently assaulted a 17-year-old boy at Meroo Meadow in February 2013 and sexually abused a 27-year-old man in Sydney in September two years later. A NSW police spokesperson said a man had been charged after an investigation “into the historic alleged sexual abuse of a man and teenage boy”. “In May 2021, detectives … established Strike Force Condello to investigate allegations of sexual violence-related offences. “Following extensive inquiries, a 40-year-old man attended Oak Flats Police Station about midday [on Tuesday].”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app In a statement, Ward denied the charges. “I am completely innocent of the charges brought against me. I will be instructing my lawyers to seek to bring this matter before the courts as quickly as possible and I look forward to demonstrating my innocence there,” he said. “While others have already attempted to prosecute my case in the media rather than the courts, out of respect for our system of justice I will not be doing the same.” Perrottet has called for Ward to resign immediately, warning he would move a motion to remove him from parliament if Ward did not do so. “While Mr Ward is entitled to the presumption of innocence, as any citizen is, the standards expected of an elected member of parliament are not compatible with the seriousness of the charges he is facing,” Perrottet said in a statement. “Following discussion with the acting premier, I have therefore attempted to contact the Kiama MP to seek his resignation from the parliament with immediate effect. “Should Mr Ward not resign, the government will move a motion to remove him from the parliament.” Perrottet has also written to the state director of the Liberal Party to ask for Ward to be suspended from the party pending the outcome of the trial. “Mr Ward is entitled to defend himself against the serious charges against him but he must do that as a private citizen,” he said. Ward has been granted conditional bail and will appear before Port Kembla local court in May. He did not say if he would be seek to remain in parliament while he fought the charges.

3/22/2022,"Two women died after being stabbed at a high school in southern Sweden on Monday, police said, adding that an 18-year-old student had been arrested. The two women, both in their 50s, were employees of the school, the police said in a statement following the attack at Malmö latinskola, a secondary school in the centre of Malmö, the country’s third largest city. Local media said the alleged attacker called the emergency number to say where he was and that he had put down his weapon and admitted to having killed two people. He was armed with a knife and an axe, according to several Swedish media. The suspect was arrested without difficulty shortly after the arrival of the first patrol, according to the police account. Earlier in the evening, police had initially reported two injured among the around 50 people in the school at the time of the incident. The two victims “were taken to the hospital but their lives could not be saved”, the authorities said. “This is absolutely terrible,” the school principal Fredrik Hemmensjö told the Aftonbladet newspaper. Police were alerted around 5:15 pm (1615 GMT) and a first patrol was able to enter the school. Footage shows heavily equipped and armed police inspecting the interior of the building. The incident took place in a new annexe of the school, which was founded in 1406 when the pope issued a letter of privilege allowing for its construction and operation. It was originally meant to educate local youth in Christian doctrine and Latin. The school remained cordoned off with police tape several hours later, and numerous police cars and ambulances were still at the scene. After initial reports of screaming in the school, “we have had more information that pointed to a serious crime being committed and that violence was occurring in the school,” police spokesman Nils Norling told AFP. “The first police patrol on site was able to arrive at the school and arrest a male suspect. They were also able to see that there were two injured people inside the school,” he said. No motive has been established so far. After extensively inspecting the scene and interviewing witnesses, the authorities are convinced the suspect acted alone. “A lot of work remains ahead of us to understand what happened and the motivation behind this appalling act,” said Asa Nilsson, one of the heads of the investigation.",News/World news,‘Absolutely terrible’: two women dead after violent incident at Malmö school,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/sweden-two-injured-after-suspected-serious-at-malmo-school
