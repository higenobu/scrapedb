4/30/2022,"It Figures is Yahoo Life's body image series, delving into the journeys of influential and inspiring figures as they explore what body confidence, body neutrality and self-love mean to them. Aly Raisman's muscles might have helped her win Olympic gold medals, but the former athlete is still making peace with her figure, calling her relationship with her body a ""work in progress."" Gymnastics had a detrimental impact on how she sees herself, Raisman tells Yahoo Life. ""The pressure of trying to be thinner was such a big part, unfortunately, of my gymnastics career,"" the 27-year-old admits. ""I felt like there was so much pressure for me to be a certain size and it kind of always felt like my body wasn't enough, that I needed to be thinner and thinner."" Raisman, who started in the sport as a kid and retired in 2020, can now reflect on how the community played a part in how she's treated and viewed her body throughout most of her life. ""There's a lot of pressure in the sport to be a certain body type and it's really hard because I was balancing trying to have enough energy to be able to do the long hours of training and everything I was doing, but then also the pressure to lose weight and be thinner,"" she explains. ""It's just a very unhealthy thing to navigate."" She's also grown aware of how gymnastics fostered a complicated relationship with puberty and didn't allow her to come to terms with the ways in which her body was maturing as a teen. ""I felt like I was kind of being pressured to lose weight when my body was naturally changing, when I was getting my period and all of the healthy things that we go through, and when we naturally put on weight, which is a healthy part of being a female,"" she says. ""I felt like there was something wrong with my body."" A part of this negative perception Raisman credits to a general lack of education of the natural processes that young women go through. The gymnastics environment bred even more pressure and a basis for harsh comparison to other young girls going through puberty themselves. ""When I was training, I was in a leotard so it's very easy to get obsessive over a few pounds here or there and it can be very, very unhealthy very quickly,"" she says. Being overly critical of each pound was something she learned from people in leadership positions. It was later reinforced as she became a female athlete in the spotlight. ""I faced a lot of scrutiny from the gymnastics world, from coaches or judges, but also scrutiny just from social media. And I can remember being 18 years old and there was a photo of me that somebody took and posted online. I remember a lot of people were saying that I put on so much weight and I looked pregnant, and I was so devastated about it, and so self-conscious about it,"" she recalls. ""Unfortunately, I have a lot of friends who can relate to that.""    A post shared by Alexandra Raisman (@alyraisman) Fellow gymnasts including McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles maintain a special place in Raisman's inner circle as a result of their uniquely shared experiences. ""Having a support system is really important,"" she says. Still, she acknowledges that it's not that easy. ""Especially if people you love or people that are supposed to be your support system aren't there for you and are the ones that are actually shaming you and being mean to you about your body."" This was certainly the case within the USA Gymnastics organization. Raisman was just one of many young women who felt unprotected during their time on the team. This was highlighted as she joined others who came forward to share that she had been abused by Nassar. While the former team doctor was sentenced in 2018 for 40 to 175 years in prison on sexual assault charges, Raisman says she's still working through the trauma that it left her with. ""There's so much shame and so much struggle that people go through after they've been abused. And it's not just something that people suffer in the moment,"" she says. ""Unfortunately, it can take a really long time to kind of feel back in our body and feel safe in our body and to feel connected to who we were."" Working with Aerie has helped Raisman on this path back to feeling confident and comfortable in her own skin.    A post shared by Alexandra Raisman (@alyraisman) ""I feel like working with Aerie has personally helped me on my journey of accepting myself because Aerie doesn't retouch any photos. I think it's really empowering to walk into a store and just to see everyone's body is unique and beautiful in their own way. And I think that's really special,"" she says. The brand also aligns with Raisman's own mantra of using social media for good. ""I know social media can be toxic at times but I really think also there's a lot of amazing things about social media,"" she says. ""I think it's great that Aerie is focusing on the positive of that, and also encouraging people to be aware of how they feel after they're scrolling through social media and making sure that we're following accounts or surrounding ourselves with things that make us feel good, that lift us up, that maybe challenge us, but not something that's making us feel bad about ourselves."" It's that same mindful approach that's allowed Raisman to come to a place of body acceptance. ""When I'm more present and I'm doing things that bring me joy, my relationship to my body is good. So I try to find things throughout the day that bring me calm or bring me joy, whether it's going for a walk outside, playing with my dog, being with people that make me laugh, gardening,"" she says. ""Over the years, I started to get a little bit of a better handle on things that might trigger me. And I notice that if one thing bothers me it's like a ripple effect and affects my body image, it affects my insecurities, it affects me overthinking things. So I just really try to stay on a sort of routine that helps me stay on track. And I also just know that I'm human, and there's going to be days where I feel more insecure than other days, or where I feel a little bit more self-conscious. I've kind of just tried to remember, I'm also human, and if I'm having a tough day, it's okay, and the day is gonna pass."" Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox?

4/30/2022,"Trump called 2020 Senate candidate Sara Gideon ""very attractive,"" according to a new book. ""Not that I've looked at a woman that way in five years—five years at least,"" he added. Trump ""could not resist weighing in with what he might call locker room talk"" about Gideon, the book says. President Donald Trump called 2020 Democratic Senate candidate Sara Gideon ""very attractive"" in meeting, adding, ""not that I've looked at a woman that way in five years,"" according to a forthcoming book by two New York Times reporters. Authors Jonathan Martins and Alexander Burns detail Trump's involvement in downballot races and 2020 meetings with party leaders in their forthcoming book ""This Will Not Pass,"" which Insider obtained ahead of its May 3 release. Then-Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, they wrote, tried to avoid bringing up races where Trump disliked the Republican incumbent, like GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who openly criticized and broke with Trump on key issues during his presidency. But in ""several meetings"" with Senate Republicans and campaign strategists, Trump ""could not resist weighing in with what he might call locker room talk"" about Gideon, ""the telegenic Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives,"" the book said. ""Sara Gideon — very attractive. Very attractive,"" Trump said on one occasion, according to the book, before adding: ""not that I've looked at a woman that way in five years—five years at least."" Trump has been married to his third wife, former first lady Melania Trump, since 2005. He has denied allegations that he had an affair with former Playboy model Karen McDougal from 2006 to 2007 and that he had sex with adult film actress Stormy Daniels in 2006. At least 26 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, including assault, since the 1970s. In the meetings, Trump would ""veer back and forth between edicts of intimidation"" against Republicans he saw as disloyal and ""playing the class clown to a chortling audience,"" the authors wrote. One frequent target of Trump's broadsides was former Arizona Sen. Martha McSally, who Trump, according to the book, called ""a horrible candidate,"" adding, ""no one likes her."" Gideon ran a high-profile campaign against Collins, who has represented Maine in the Senate since 1997, hoping to capitalize on mounting liberal anger against Collins — and particularly over her vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. Despite Gideon significantly outraising and outspending Collins, bringing in an eye-popping $74 million for her campaign and spending over $62 million, the incumbent was decisively reelected by over eight percentage points – even as President Joe Biden easily carried the state in the presidential race. Representatives for Trump did not immediately return Insider's request for comment.

4/30/2022,"A former F-35 test pilot weighed in on the fighter jet’s performance in the Ukraine conflict and how it represents a massive leap forward from Cold War-era aircraft. Billie Flynn contends the F-35 is so different from Soviet Cold War fighters that pilots used to the latter would be unable to transition to the F-35. Flynn also thinks the F-35 is the most survivable aircraft for the dangerous skies over Ukraine. One of the most noted authorities on the F-35 has some interesting things to say about the jet, including how it would fit in with European air forces, and how suitable the fighter is for the air war over Ukraine. Billie Flynn, a former Lockheed Martin test pilot, also talked about how the jet represents a massive leap forward from older, Soviet-designed fighter jets, noting that the pilots who train them would be unable to learn how to fly the F-35. Flynn also believes the F-35 is the only jet that can survive in the lethal air environment over Ukraine. Billie Flynn is one of the most accomplished test pilots around. Flynn originally flew CF-18 Hornets for the Royal Canadian Air Force, and later flew as a test pilot for the Eurofighter Typhoon. He later went on to fly for Lockheed Martin for 17 years, from 2003 to 2020, in support of the Joint Strike Fighter program. Flynn is a big fan of the F-35, and if there’s anyone who knows the jet inside and out, it’s him. In a wide-ranging interview with The Aviationist, Flynn touched upon a number of points about the F-35. One of the most interesting is his assertion that pilots in Eastern European countries that still fly Soviet-era fighters are just going to be unable to fly a fifth-generation jet like the F-35. Three NATO countries—Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Poland—still fly the Soviet MiG-29 fighter jet, classified by NATO in the 1980s as the “Fulcrum.” The MiG-29, designed in the late 1970s, is the equivalent of the American F-16 Fighting Falcon. The collapse of the Warsaw Pact in 1989 and the absorption of most countries into NATO means that some countries fly both MiG-29s and F-16s. And, as it continues to modernize, Poland will soon be in the unique position of flying MiG-29s, F-16s, and F-35s. Does this mean a Polish pilot could fly all three? Not so fast, says Flynn. He contends that pilots that have flown Soviet-era fighters for the bulk of their careers would simply be unable to effectively fly the F-35. The MiG-29 is a completely different aircraft built with different design philosophies in mind. The MiG also lacks the technological sophistication of the F-35, from the stealthy design to the distributed aperture system that allows the pilot to “see” through the side of his aircraft. A pilot unused to such advances, flying on muscle memory and learned instinct, might not properly take advantage of everything the F-35 has to offer. Flynn believes that Poland’s air force, which could soon fly all three jets, would likely push F-16 pilots into the F-35, leaving MiG pilots to close out their careers on the aging jets. Flynn also believes that the F-35 would dominate in the air war over Ukraine, because it is exactly the environment the jet was built to excel in. The war has already claimed more than three dozen fighters and attack jets from both sides. Ukrainian Air Force jets, for example, not only have to deal with Su-30M Flanker and Su-35 Flanker-E twin engine, multi-role fighters, but S-400 long-range air defense systems and short-range battlefield air defense systems. Russian fighters must contend with Ukrainian fighters, Ukraine’s original air defense network, and now an increasing number of surface-to-air missile systems donated by NATO. The F-35 is only the second fighter jet in history developed with stealth technology from the ground up, and specifically with the S-400 missile system in mind. Furthermore, Flynn believes the jet’s network of sensors, and ability to share data with other aircraft and ground assets, would make it an efficient air-defense killer, identifying S-400s and similar platforms and then killing them with ruthless efficiency. Flynn asserts that while nobody wants NATO dragged into the war, if it was, it would “completely destroy the Russian forces.” You Might Also Like This Device Can Send Messages Without Cell Service The Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere The Best Video Game the Year You Were Born",Business/Popular Mechanics,F-35 Pilot: NATO Could ‘Completely Destroy the Russian Forces’,https://news.yahoo.com/f-35-pilot-nato-could-172200905.html
4/30/2022,"Danica Patrick is speaking out about why she had her breast implants removed. The racecar driver took to Instagram Friday to share that she underwent explant surgery, noting that she first went under the knife in November 2014. “I got them because I want to have it all. I was really fit, but I didn’t have boobs,” she wrote. “So I got them. Everything went well, and I was happy with them. Fast forward about 3 years to early 2018, and I noticed that my hair was not as healthy and was breaking off. I also gained a few pounds and had no luck losing it.” She added that by late 2020, “the wheels came off” in terms of her health. “I had cycle irregularity, gained more weight, my hair wasn’t looking healthy at all and my face was a different shape (weird I know),” she continued. “So I went down the rabbit hole to figure it out. I did every test that could be done.” Patrick listed her symptoms, which included hypothyroidism, dry scalp, adrenal fatigue, face swelling, dizziness, swollen lymph nodes, hair loss and a slew of other puzzling things she attributed to her breast implants. “I had them removed on Wednesday,” she continued, saying that she noticed a difference within hours. “I could take a 30% deeper breath into my chest already, and I had so much energy when I woke up.” ""The condition that is not universally recognized is called breast implant illness,"" she went on to say. ""There are a host of issues that women have dealt with and I have many, but not all. After watching over 100 stories on YouTube.... my belief is, it’s not if but when you develop symptoms. Some are right away, others are over 15 years later. Silicone is a foreign object and leaches chemicals (look up that huge list!) that’s why the body produces a capsule around it."" She concluded, ""If this post helps just one get to the root of their issues, it did it’s job. I will share my progress as I go along."" Patrick received praise for her candor in the comments section. TV personality Catt Sadler wrote, “Wow Danica — what an important post! So happy you’re FREE and thank you for sharing this story ! Feel better.” Chef Serena Poon added, “So proud of you and so excited for you for this new chapter of health and vitality.” News host Jen Herrera, who has opened up about her own experience with breast implants and published the book Are Your Fake Boobs Making You Sick? shared, “Welcome to the club. Best decision ever. You will never look back. I was diagnosed with a crazy autoimmune disease- horrible rashes and joint pain. As soon as they came out symptoms gone. Congrats!” Breast implant illness is not yet an official medical diagnosis, however, many patients have reported feeling a collection of unusual symptoms after their implant surgery. In 2019, the FDA held a conference on the matter. Following the conference, the organization issued a statement, which said, “While the FDA doesn’t have definitive evidence demonstrating breast implants cause these symptoms, the current evidence supports that some women experience systemic symptoms that may resolve when their breast implants are removed, referred to by some patients and health care professionals as breast implant illness. We believe women considering a breast implant should be aware of these risks.” Dr. Tim Sayed, a board-certified plastic surgeon who performs explant surgeries, previously told Yahoo Life that he has no doubt that breast implant illness is real. ""Breast implant illness is a term given to a phenomenon where some women who have implants experience symptoms not localized to the breast,"" Sayed tells Yahoo Life. ""So that means symptoms connected to other organs — symptoms like brain fog, fatigue, joint pain, rheumatologic types of symptomatology, GI issues, rashes, hair loss and other things."" Patrick isn’t the only star to go public about removing her breast implants. Last year, The Bachelorette’s Clare Crawley said that her implants were making her sick as well. She, too, decided to have explant surgery. ""As much as I've loved having these [implants], I love my health more, I love my well-being more,"" Crawley said at the time.

4/30/2022,"Denys Karlovskyi - Friday, 29 April 2022, 20:49 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has explained that many Ukrainians will want to take revenge on Russian occupiers who have committed mass murders in Ukraine without waiting for them to be convicted by international tribunals. Source: Zelenskyy in an interview with Polish media According to Zelenskyy: ""I know that there are people in our society who will seek out every [Russian soldier who has committed mass murders of Ukrainian civilians - ed.]. Nothing can be done about it. This is not a threat. I'm telling you frankly, as a father, as a husband. I know that there are many people who feel like that in Ukraine. How they've been fighting and how they've held out shows just how many of them there are. Some will wait for an international tribunal, while others will wait for the night, as we say. That's all there is to it."" Details: Zelenskyy believes that international condemnation is also very important if Russians are to develop a sense of historical guilt and complicity for the tragedy of the war in Ukraine in the same way as Germans feel historical responsibility for the atrocities committed by Nazis during World War II. Background: In his nightly address on 28 April, President Zelenskyy threatened Russian soldiers who have murdered and tortured civilians in Ukraine with swift punishment by international courts and tribunals. At the same time, he admitted that some will not face trial because they will have received appropriate retribution from Ukrainian defenders on the battlefield. The President had also said earlier that the level and scale of atrocities committed by the Russian occupying forces in their attempts to conquer Ukraine are so glaring that history textbooks will have a special word for this phenomenon - ""Ruscism"".

The clip comes courtesy of a 20-year-old Waffle House employee named Nirajah Taylor (@nirajah.t). According to her post, the TikToker has been working at the 24/7 diner chain since she was 16. Federal Reserve raises interest rates for first time since 2018 In her video, Taylor shares photos featuring large stacks of money and checks with tips of up to $100. The clip took many viewers by surprise, although many Waffle House employees jumped in to comment that the job can be surprisingly lucrative. Taylor’s clip is part of an ever-growing trend on the app, in which users post transparently about their jobs and pay. Recently, other TikTokers have shared similar videos, including NFL water boys, notaries and even online trivia hosts. Although Taylor’s post doesn’t specify exactly how much she makes, it does make it clear she’s happy with her situation. She even asked viewers to tag the official Waffle House TikTok account in their comments. While the earnings surprised many users, some said they’d learned firsthand how well the job can pay. “I miss working there,” one user wrote. “Was nothing to make $1,000-$1400 a week.” “I believe this 100%,” another agreed. Rupaul's Drag Race' winner Symone dishes her post-drag skincare secrets: “I know the ppl that work there make good money,” another added. “I be in there drunk tipping like I’m rich all because of the conversation.” Other commenters pointed out that some Waffle House employees earn minimum wage. However, there are countless roles at the company that pay much more than the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour. According to Indeed, the average grill cook makes $12.91 an hour, while the average server makes $13.33. Meanwhile, there are managerial roles that pay salaries averaging close to $60,000 per year.

4/30/2022,"China has slammed Australia for opposing its security pact with Solomon Islands, calling it a colonialist myth-driven violation of sovereignty and saying Canberra had no right to lay down any ""red line"". This came as Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said a Chinese military base in the South Pacific nation would be a ""red line"" for his government, days after Beijing and Honiara confirmed the signing of the deal without revealing details. Talk of China building a naval base on Solomon Islands was ""purely fake news"", Chinese defence ministry spokesman Tan Kefei said on Thursday, accusing the Australian government and media of intentionally distorting facts and creating tension. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Cooperation under the new security pact would involve ""maintaining social order, protecting people's lives and property, humanitarian assistance [and] natural disaster responses"", Tan reiterated. Addressing an online event with Pacific Island nations the same day, China's vice foreign minister Xie Feng said negotiating and signing a framework security cooperation agreement was ""the sacred right of two sovereign countries"" in line with international laws and norms, and no one had the right to point fingers at China. ""On what grounds can Australia draw a 'red line' for Solomon Islands, 2,000km [1,200 miles] away, and China, 10,000km away? If not an infringement of another country's sovereignty, interference in another country's internal affairs and a breach of international rules, what is this?"" Xie said Australia's stance amounted to ""disinformation, defamation, coercion and intimidation"", and proof that it was still ""obsessed with colonialist myths, exercising coercive diplomacy, trying hard to control the Pacific islands to maintain a so-called sphere of influence"". ""The Pacific is the common home of regional countries, not someone's 'backyard' or 'turf', and should be a stage for international cooperation, not a chessboard for geopolitical games,"" he declared. The China-Solomon security agreement is ""open and transparent [and] not targeted at third parties,"" Xie told a virtual event launching a cooperation centre on climate change for China and Pacific Island countries, in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong. He said China understood the climate change challenges facing the island nations and was willing to provide help ""as a good friend, partner and brother."" Attending the event virtually were officials from Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Niue, Samoa, Tonga, Micronesia, Kiribati, Fiji and Vanuatu.

Photo: AFP> ""China has no selfish interest in developing relations and cooperation with Pacific Island countries,"" Xie asserted. ""[It] does not seek 'spheres of influence' or engage in bullying and coercion but is always a constructive force for peace and development."" Since being announced last week, the China-Solomon Islands security pact has sparked strong concerns from the United States and its Pacific allies. The White House sent a high-level delegation to Honiara to warn Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare of unspecified action against his country. US ally Japan on Monday also dispatched a foreign vice-minister, saying the deal with Beijing could affect the security of the entire Asia-Pacific region, while fellow Pacific nation New Zealand has also questioned whether it will destabilise the region. Australia, which is the Solomons' biggest aid donor and has security ties with it, reacted even more strongly. It had tried to pressure Sogavare into not signing the deal when the news first broke in March. And while Morrison has reiterated his opposition to a Chinese naval base, other politicians have presented even stronger rhetoric on the impact of the deal on Australia's national security. Sogavare has sought to reassure all that a Chinese base was not in the offing, urging critics to respect his country's sovereign interests and said that traditional partners, such as Australia and New Zealand, remained important.

4/30/2022,"KHARKIV, Ukraine (AP) — Viktor appeared nervous as masked Ukrainian security officers in full riot gear, camouflage and weapons pushed into his cluttered apartment in the northern city of Kharkiv. His hands trembled and he tried to cover his face. The middle-aged man came to the attention of Ukraine’s Security Service, the SBU, after what authorities said were his social media posts praising Russian President Vladimir Putin for “fighting with the Nazis,” calling for regions to secede and labeling the national flag “a symbol of death.” “Yes, I supported (the Russian invasion of Ukraine) a lot. I’m sorry. … I have already changed my mind,"" said Viktor, his trembling voice showing clear signs of duress in the presence of the Ukrainian security officers. “Get your things and get dressed,” an officer said before escorting him out of the apartment. The SBU did not reveal Viktor's last name, citing their investigation. Viktor was one of nearly 400 people in the Kharkiv region alone who have been detained under anti-collaboration laws enacted quickly by Ukraine's parliament and signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. Offenders face up to 15 years in prison for collaborating with Russian forces, making public denials about Russian aggression or supporting Moscow. Anyone whose actions result in deaths could face life in prison. “Accountability for collaboration is inevitable, and whether it will happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is another question,” Zelenskyy said. “The most important thing is that justice will be served inevitably.” Although the Zelenskyy government has broad support, even among many Russian speakers, not all Ukrainians oppose the invasion. Support for Moscow is more common among some Russian-speaking residents of the Donbas, an industrial region in the east. An eight-year conflict there between Moscow-backed separatists and Ukrainian government forces had killed over 14,000 people even before this year’s invasion. Some businessmen, civic and state officials and members of the military are among those who have gone over to the Russian side, and Ukraine’s State Bureau of Investigations said more than 200 criminal cases on collaboration have been opened. Zelenskyy has even stripped two SBU generals of their rank, accusing them of treason. A “registry of collaborators” is being compiled and will be released to the public, said Oleksiy Danilov, head of Ukraine’s Security Council. He refused to say how many people were targeted nationwide. Under martial law, authorities have banned 11 pro-Russian political parties, including the largest one that had 25 seats in the 450-member parliament – the Opposition Platform For Life, which was founded by Viktor Medvedchuk, a jailed oligarch with close ties to Putin. Authorities say pro-Russian activists in southeastern Ukraine, the scene of active fighting, are acting as spotters to direct shelling. “One of our key goals is to have no one stab our armed forces in the back,” said Roman Dudin, head of the Kharkiv branch of the SBU, in an interview with The Associated Press. He spoke in a dark basement where the SBU moved its operations after its building in central Kharkiv was shelled. The Kharkiv branch has been detaining people who support the invasion, call for secession and claim that Ukrainian forces are shelling their own cities. Allegations of collaborating with the enemy carry strong historic resonance in Ukraine. During World War II, some in the region welcomed and even cooperated with invading forces from Nazi Germany after years of Stalinist repression that included the “Holodomor” – a man-made famine believed to have killed more than 3 million Ukrainians. For years afterward, Soviet authorities cited the cooperation of some Ukrainian nationalists with the Nazis as a reason to demonize today’s democratically elected leaders of Ukraine. Human rights advocates know of “dozens” of detentions of pro-Russian activists in Kyiv alone since the new laws were passed, but how many have been targeted nationwide is unclear, said Volodymyr Yavorskyy, coordinator at the Center for Civil Liberties, one of Ukraine's largest human rights groups. “There is no complete data on the (entire) country, since it is all classified by the SBU,” Yavorskyy told AP. “Ukrainian authorities are actively using the practice of Western countries, in particular the U.K., which imposed harsh restrictions on civic liberties in warring Northern Ireland. Some of those restrictions were deemed unjustified by human rights advocates, but others were justified, when people's lives were in danger,” he said. A person in Ukraine can be detained for up to 30 days without a court order, he said, and antiterrorism legislation under martial law allows authorities not to tell defense attorneys about their clients being remanded. “In effect, these people disappear, and for 30 days there's no access to them,” Yavorskyy said. “In reality, (law enforcement) has powers to take anyone.” The government knows the implications of detaining people over their opinions, including that it risks playing into Moscow's line that Kyiv is repressing Russian speakers. But in wartime, officials say, freedom of speech is only part of the equation. “The debate about the balance of national security and ensuring freedom of speech is endless,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told AP. Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the U.N. human rights office, said her agency has documented “cases of arrests and detention allegedly made by Ukrainian law enforcement authorities, which may involve elements of human rights violations” and is following up with the Ukrainian government. She said her office is looking into eight cases that “appear to be disappearances of people considered as ‘pro-Russian,’ and we have documented two cases of unlawful killings of ‘pro-Russians,’” along with cases of vigilantism, in which law enforcement and others punish those suspected of being pro-Russian, In the town of Bucha, now a symbol of horrific violence in the war, Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk said collaborators gave invading troops the names and addresses of pro-Ukrainian activists and officials in the city outside Kyiv, with hundreds of civilians shot to death with their hands tied behind their backs or their bodies burned by Russian forces. ""I saw these execution lists, dictated by the traitors -– the Russians knew in advance who they’re going to, at what address, and who lives there,” said Fedoruk, who saw his own name on one list. “Of course, Ukrainian authorities will search for and punish these people.” In the besieged port city of Mariupol, officials accused collaborators of helping the Russians cut off electricity, running water, gas and communications in much of the city. “Now I understand perfectly why the Russians were carrying out such precise, coordinated strikes on objects of critical infrastructure, knew about all locations and even times when Ukrainian buses evacuating refugees were supposed to depart,” said Mayor Vadym Boychenko. Political analysts say the invasion and the brutality by Russian troops against civilians have turned off many Moscow sympathizers. Still, many such supporters remain. “Russian propaganda took deep roots and many residents of the east who watch Russian TV channels believe absurd claims that it’s Ukrainians who are shelling them and other myths,” Volodymyr Fesenko of the Penta Center think tank told AP. “Naturally, Ukrainian authorities in the southeast are afraid of getting stabbed in the back and are forced to tighten security measures.” Unlike Viktor, whose Kharkiv apartment was raided, 86-year-old Volodymir Radnenko didn’t seem surprised when Ukrainian security arrived to search his flat Saturday after detaining his son, Ihor. The military said the son was suspected of helping the Russians in shelling of the city — some of which occurred in Radnenko's neighborhood about 15 minutes before the officers showed up, with the smell of smoke lingering. At least two people were killed and 19 others wounded in the region. “He is used to thinking that Russia is all there is,” Radnenko told AP after the officers left. “I ask him: ’So who is shelling us? It’s not our (people), it’s your fascists.’ And he only gets angry at that.” —- Karmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

4/30/2022,"Denmark has become the first country to suspend its COVID vaccination program as health officials say the country’s epidemic has been brought under control. “Spring has arrived, vaccine coverage in the Danish population is high, and the epidemic has reversed,” the health authority said. “Therefore, the National Board of Health is now ending the broad vaccination efforts against COVID-19 for this season.” According to official data, 89% of people over the age of 12 in Denmark have been fully vaccinated against COVID, while 76% of adults have received a booster shot. Almost half of children aged between five and 11 have had one dose of a vaccine, while a third have been given two doses. On Wednesday, Denmark recorded 1,386 new cases of the virus, according to Our World in Data. In an emailed statement on Thursday, the Danish Health Authority told Fortune that the epidemic situation in Denmark is “favorable.” “We can therefore close the general vaccination program for the spring and summer, which means that new invitations to be vaccinated are no longer being sent,” the authority said. Officials are set to stop sending out invitations for vaccinations as of May 15. But the health authority said it continues to recommend vaccination against COVID, particularly to those who are at greater risk of serious disease. Those at the greatest risk are eligible for a fourth vaccine dose in Denmark. “We will continue to monitor the development of the epidemic closely, and we are ready to resume the general vaccination program should the need arise before a new COVID-19 season is expected to begin in the autumn,” the Danish Health Authority told Fortune. The authority is likely to resume its broad vaccination program in the fall, with officials saying there will probably be a need to vaccinate ahead of an expected seasonal uptick in infections. Denmark’s withdrawal of its aggressive vaccination strategy reflects the country’s somewhat hands-off response to COVID through the course of this year. In February, Denmark lifted almost all of its COVID restrictions despite being in the middle of a huge Omicron wave and cases of the virus being at record highs. Danish health officials have touted so-called hybrid immunity—widespread population immunity achieved through a combination of vaccination and infection—as a reason for the country’s COVID epidemic becoming more controllable.

4/30/2022,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's government does not plan to hold a referendum if its parliament decides to proceed with an application for NATO membership, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said on Friday. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced both Sweden and Finland to review long held beliefs that military neutrality is the best means of ensuring national security, with both countries expected to make a decision in the coming few weeks. Andersson said that a referendum was a ""bad idea"". ""I don't think it is an issue that is suitable for a referendum,"" she told reporters. ""There is a lot of information about national security that is confidential, so there are important issues in such a referendum that cannot be discussed and important facts that cannot be put on the table."" Sweden's parliament is reviewing security policy with a report expected in mid-May. Separately, Andersson's own party, the Social Democrats, are looking at whether to drop their objections to NATO membership. With a majority in parliament backing membership, the ruling Social Democrats are seen as the biggest hurdle to Sweden applying to join the 30-nation alliance. The leader of the Moderates, the biggest opposition party, has also rejected calls for a referendum on the issue. ""Voters ... are not naive about Russia,"" Ulf Kristersson told daily Aftonbladet earlier this week in a debate with Left Party leader Nooshi Dadgostar. ""It's very clear that Swedish voters have understood what happened on 24 February and have drawn their conclusions."" Dadgostar, whose party opposes NATO membership, told Aftonbladet that Swedes should get a say in the decision. ""This .. has to go back to the voters, there has to be very strong democratic support in this question,"" she said. Sweden holds a general election in September. An opinion poll by Demoskop in daily Aftonbladet published on April 20 showed 57% of Swedes in favour of joining NATO, up from 51% in March.

4/30/2022,"A disgraced Republican lawmaker charged with raping a teenage intern testified on Thursday that he believed the act had been consensual, following a first date he described as a successful one. But in the middle of her own testimony a day earlier, former Idaho State Rep. Aaron von Ehlinger’s accuser, identified in court filings only as “Jane Doe,” became so distressed that she fled the courtroom, saying, “I can’t do this” as she walked out. When it became apparent that Doe would not be returning, the prosecution rested its case, bringing an abrupt end to a lurid trial that has captured national attention. Given Doe could not be cross-examined, Judge Michael Reardon ordered her testimony stricken from the record, telling jurors to disregard everything she said. The jury will now have to deliberate “as if she never showed up at all,” said criminal defense lawyer David P. Shapiro, who is not involved with the case but who has handled numerous similar ones. “It’s hard to unring that bell,” Shapiro told The Daily Beast. Still, he continued, “It will be very very difficult, if not impossible, to get a conviction without her testimony.” Prosecutors allege von Ehlinger, 39, forced Doe, 19, to perform oral sex on him, and penetrated her with his finger at his Boise home after the two went out to dinner in March 2021. Von Ehlinger resigned the next month before he could be expelled from the state legislature, following a bipartisan ethics committee’s finding that he engaged in “behavior unbecoming.” That September, a warrant for his arrest was issued. He was taken into custody later that month at Atlanta’s international airport as he returned to the U.S. from an extended vacation in Central America—which von Ehlinger’s lawyer insisted had been pre-planned and not an attempt to evade justice. Doe, for her part, was targeted by von Ehlinger’s fellow Republicans from the get-go. Last August, Rep. Priscilla Giddings, a Republican from the tiny town of White Bird, exposed Doe’s identity on social media and in an email to constituents, with right-wing blogs subsequently posting Doe’s name and photo online. In his testimony, von Ehlinger said he met Doe and gave her his cellphone number after inviting her up to his office to look at his artwork in January 2021. He said they would see each other around the Statehouse once in a while, and would talk. But he was not hitting on her, he insisted. The two made dinner plans in early March after Doe texted him to say hi, according to von Ehlinger. He picked her up in his roommate’s car, and took her to eat at Barbacoa, a Spanish steakhouse in Boise, he testified. Neither of them drank any alcohol during the three-hour meal, he said. Doe held his hand on the ride back to his place, von Ehlinger claimed, noting that when they arrived at his apartment building, he parked in a handicapped spot and took Doe upstairs. “Things were going well, and I asked… if she would like to move to the bedroom,” von Ehlinger said Thursday on the stand. “She said ‘Sure.’ We got up, held hands and walked into the bedroom.” Doe said previously that von Ehlinger always carried a gun, and that he had unholstered it upon arriving home and placed it on the nightstand. In court, von Ehlinger denied this, saying that he “very rarely” carried his gun, which he claimed was in the closet that night. “I complimented her, I let her know how beautiful she was,” von Ehlinger testified. Libertarian Youth Group’s Ex-Boss Charged With Raping Classmate Von Ehlinger claimed Doe never said she was uncomfortable with what was happening, and “willingly” performed oral sex on him for about 15 seconds. Then, he said she stopped, saying that “tonight is probably not a good night to have sex” because she hadn’t shaved and was not on birth control. He then stimulated himself manually and ejaculated on Doe’s stomach, he said in court. “She never once gave me any indication that she did not want to participate in this,” von Ehlinger said. In a criminal complaint filed last October, along with testimony this week, prosecutors laid out a raft of details they argued undercut von Ehlinger’s claims. Doe resisted von Ehlinger’s unwanted advances, the complaint states, however “her resistance was overcome by…an objectively reasonable belief that resistance would be futile or that resistance would result in force or violence” by von Ehlinger. In her opening arguments earlier this week, prosecutor Katelyn Farley described the case as being “about power—power wielded in the wrong hands.” She said von Ehlinger told Doe that he needed to stop by his apartment after dinner to pick something up but once they got there, von Ehringer allegedly carried her into his bedroom and assaulted her, forcing his penis into her mouth and pinning her arms down with his legs as he ejaculated on her. “He didn’t stop and he didn’t listen to [Doe],” Farley told the jury. On Thursday, Cox told the jury that von Ehlinger, an Army veteran, injured his back in a helicopter crash during his service, and thus could not have lifted Doe and carried her as she described. GOP Lawmaker Under Fire Over Texts to Inmate Facing Child Porn Charges Jurors also heard testimony from Doe’s mother, who said her daughter had been a volunteer at a domestic violence advocacy center before the alleged assault, as well as Anne Wardle, a nurse who administered a rape exam and said Doe was in tears as she recounted what happened. Wardle said Doe had a “goose egg” from her head hitting the wall of von Ehlinger’s bedroom as she struggled to get away. On Wednesday, Doe took the stand for direct examination by prosecutors. She struggled visibly, staring at the defense table and glancing toward the exits as she spoke. Farley implored Doe to focus on her and her testimony, to which Doe said, “I can’t.” As she began to describe what happened that night at von Ehlinger’s apartment, Doe stopped suddenly and said, “I can’t do this,” before walking out of the courtroom. She never came back. This, said Shapiro, set up a “Sixth Amendment confrontation issue,” which would deny von Ehlinger his Constitutional right to confront his accuser. “So her entire testimony is being stricken because the defense did not have a chance to cross-examine her,” Shapiro told The Daily Beast. “What they do have is the testimony from the nurse who… was able to get in some of the accuser’s statements,” Shapiro explained, noting that Doe’s mother’s testimony also remains on the record. “So the jury gets to hear some of what the accuser said to her, but it is historically very difficult for a jury to return a verdict of guilty in any case, especially a sexual assault case, if they have zero testimony to consider from the accuser.” In essence, Shapiro said, the case went “from a ‘He said, she said,’ but now there’s no longer a ‘She said,’ because her testimony was stricken. The defense was not that it didn’t happen—they found his DNA all over her body.” The jury began deliberations on Thursday. Von Ehlinger, who was appointed to the Idaho House of Representatives in June 2020 to finish out a dead lawmaker’s term, stepped down after serving for less than a year. If convicted of rape and forcible penetration by use of a foreign object, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

4/30/2022,"By Karen Freifeld and Luc Cohen NEW YORK (Reuters) -A New York judge expressed surprise on Friday that Donald Trump, a man he described as perhaps the world's most famous real estate developer, was unable to provide any documents sought in a probe of the Trump Organization, his family company. Justice Arthur Engoron in New York state court in Manhattan said at a virtual hearing that he would go on holding the former U.S. president in contempt of court and fine him $10,000 a day despite a request from Trump's lawyer to lift both orders. ""He's Donald Trump, the most famous real estate developer in the world, arguably,"" the judge said. ""I am surprised he doesn't seem to have any documents; they're all with the organization."" On Monday, Engoron issued the orders over Trump's failure to comply with New York Attorney General Letitia James' subpoena for documents. On Wednesday, Trump signed an affidavit saying he did not believe he had any relevant documents and, if there were any documents, the Trump Organization would have them. On Friday, Engoron, who read Trump's affidavit at the hearing, said the document bore ""his inimitable signature"" in what appeared to be a Sharpie. But he said that it lacked useful detail about where Trump kept his records. In order to purge the contempt finding, Trump would have to submit an affidavit swearing to where his files were located, how they were stored, and who had access to them, as well as state whether he turned over his personal electronic devices for searching and imaging, the judge said later in a written order. At the hearing, Engoron homed in on the small pieces of paper with an adhesive strip on one side that Trump is known for using. ""He's famous for post-its,"" the judge said. ""When he wants something done, he puts a post-it on something. I don't think we've received any post-its."" Trump Organization general counsel Alan Garten testified as part of the attorney general's probe that Trump used post-it notes to communicate with employees, court records show. But Trump lawyer Alina Habba said Trump does not have any post-its. ""You can fine us for 10 months but you're not going to get any more documents from Donald Trump,"" Habba said. ""He doesn't have the documents that you want."" James says her probe has already turned up evidence that the Trump Organization - which manages hotels, golf courses and other real estate around the world - has given banks and tax authorities misleading financing information in order to obtain financial benefits such as favorable loans and tax breaks. Engoron said he would consider Habba's request to terminate the fine. ""But if you don't hear from me, the clock is still ticking,"" he said. A Republican, Trump denies wrongdoing and calls the probe politically motivated. James is a Democrat. Habba said on Friday that she would continue appealing against both the contempt order and the fine following Engoron's oral ruling.

4/30/2022,"How do we know when wearing a specific outfit is or isn’t appropriate for boarding an airline’s business class? A South Korean DJ learned this lesson the hard way. According to an article published by the Australian website Dmarge, DJ Hwang So-hee, known as DeeJay Soda, was kicked off her American Airlines business class flight for wearing pants that airline staff considered inappropriate. She also claims she was intimidated into taking them off in public. The artist was coming back from JFK to LAX with American Airlines. The incident happened because she was wearing pants with the inscription “F*ck you” all over the clothing. The pant was designed by a brand that sponsors the artist. “I was forced out of the plane and was harassed to take off my pants in front of the flight crews at the gate. I have never had an issue with wearing this pair of pants before in my many months of touring in North America and they did not have any problem with me wearing it at the time of check-in nor when I sat down at my seat,” DeeJay Soda said on her Instagram account. She has over 4,3 million followers. DeeJay Soda revealed that initially she entered the plane without any issues and was very welcomed by American Airlines business class crew members. She said that after boarding the flight, she was drinking in the airline’s business class when a staff suddenly approached her and took her off the plane with her belongings without any kind of explanation. “As I was escorted off the plane, they claimed that my sweatpants were ‘inappropriate’ and ‘offensive’ telling me that I need to take the next flight,” she commented. Soda added that she had an important meeting set up in LA on that day, and she did not have other options but to fly to LA on that AA flight. “I pleaded to stay on the flight but was ignored by the staff and the flight attendants. I even offered to get changed but the request was denied. What happened next was horrendous.” Then, in order to comply with the AA staff requirements and reboard the plane, she decided to take off her pants. “With my broken fingers, I hardly ended up taking off my pants in front of the whole crew and standing half-naked while they still refused to board me on the flight. They even sarcastically commented that I could have taken off my pants earlier. When they finally let me enter, I put my pants inside out and finally sat down after an hour of delay causing inconvenience to the members of the flights on board. I was mortified and trembling in fear for the next 6 hours on my flight back to LA.”

4/30/2022,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Solomon Islands signed a security pact with China because a similar deal with Australia was inadequate, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said, adding his country knew the cost of war and would not be part of any militarisation of the Pacific. Addressing parliament on Friday, Sogavare made his first public comments since talks with White House Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell, who visited Hoinara days after the security pact with China was announced. China's attempts to extend its military influence in the Pacific have put Western allies on guard, and the security pact with the Solomons has roiled the Australian election campaign. While details of the pact with China have not been disclosed, Sogavare has ruled out a military base and said it covers domestic policing. Sogavare said on Friday the security agreement with China was needed because an agreement with traditional partner Australia was ""inadequate"". Opposition parties have criticised the government's secrecy over the terms of the pact with Beijing, and Western allies are concerned that it could provide a gateway for a Chinese military presence. Australia and New Zealand have warned the pact could upset long standing regional security cooperation. Sogavare said Campbell and a separate Japanese delegation had warned him against allowing China to build a naval base because it was not in the region's interests. Sogavare, who has previously said that there were no such plans, said he agreed with the delegations. ""We don't need to be reminded of the cost of war,"" Sogavare told parliament. He said the Solomon Islands would never accept the militarisation of the Pacific after what it experienced in World War Two, and criticised the United States for failing to include the islands in funding for post-war reconstruction. Campbell had agreed to speed up the removal of unexploded World War Two ordnance, Sogavare said. Echoing comments made by China's foreign ministry, Sogavare also criticised Australia's signing of the AUKUS defence alliance with the United States and Britain last year without consulting Pacific island nations. ""The AUKUS treaty will see nuclear submarines in Pacific waters. I learnt of the AUKUS treaty in the media. One would expect that as a member of the Pacific family, Solomon Islands... would have been consulted."" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Friday he spoke to Sogavare the day after the announcement of AUKUS and he had not raised any objections.

4/30/2022,"Putin's propaganda machine will struggle to hide the consequences of the Ukraine war for much longer, a former Kremlin insider says. ""In three months, the shops and factories will run out of stocks,"" Sergei Pugachev told the Washington Post. ""And the scale of deaths in the Russian military will become clear,"" Pugachev added. It's only a matter of time until Russians begin to see through Russian President Vladimir Putin's propaganda on the Ukraine war, according to a former Kremlin insider who spoke to the Washington Post. ""In three months, the shops and factories will run out of stocks, and the scale of deaths in the Russian military will become clear,"" Sergei Pugachev, once part of Putin's inner circle, told the Post. Pugachev, formerly known as ""Putin's banker,"" fled to London in 2011 after falling out with the Russian leader. The ex-Russian banker, who's been accused of embezzlement by the Russian government, has said the deterioration of his relationship with Putin made him fear for his life, per BBC News. Russia is estimated to have lost up to 15,000 soldiers in Ukraine since the war began roughly two months ago, but Putin's propaganda machine has obscured the true death toll and vied to keep it hidden from the public. Meanwhile, Russia's economy has been left reeling from the slew of sanctions imposed on it by countries across the globe. Major companies have left Russia and inflation is skyrocketing. Despite the dire situation, Putin has sought to paint a rosy picture of Russia's economic outlook. He's declared that Western sanctions have failed. But Elvira Nabiullina, the governor of Russia's Central Bank, on Friday told reporters, ""We are in a zone of colossal uncertainty."" And according to the Post's reporting, many of Russia's wealthiest people have seen their business empires decimated as a result of the Ukraine war. ""In one day, they destroyed what was built over many years. It's a catastrophe,"" one Russian businessman told the Post. The man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, was among a group of wealthy Russians who were called upon to meet with Putin the day he launched the unprovoked invasion in late February. As they waited roughly two hours for Putin to arrive at the meeting, one participant told the Post, ""Some of them said, 'We've lost everything.'"" That said, the Post's report also said that Russian magnates are still wary of publicly speaking against the war or Putin. The Russian leader, whose critics often wind up dead or behind bars, signed a law shortly after the invasion that could see people sentenced to up to 15 years in prison for spreading ""fake news"" on the Russian military. ""What they say is subtle: The context is that the West, NATO is to blame…They are talking about this as though it is a conspiracy against Russia,"" Pugachev told the Post. But as the war drags on and the pain of the economic penalties is felt more acutely across Russia, some say Putin will become increasingly isolated and more people will turn against him. Vladimir Ashurkov, the executive director of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, earlier this week told Insider that the Ukraine was has accelerated Putin's downfall because of the immense consequences for the Russian elite. ""The beginning of the end of Putin started some time ago. But I'm confident that this war has made many people in Russia and outside of Russia unhappy with him.

4/30/2022,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters) By Peter Apps LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Some 10 miles inside Russia at a military base near the village of Golovchino, dozens of damaged, burnt and blasted Russian armoured vehicles have been dragged into scattergun positions as workers attempt to repair and salvage spares. As Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine enters its third month, the scene – recorded by a Ukrainian-built Leleka drone flying inside Russian airspace and then shared with British tabloid the Sun as propaganda – is a reminder of just how far the campaign has been from the short, victorious war the world expected and the Kremlin hoped for. All sides appear to be hardening their positions, rhetoric and actions. Russia this week accused the West of risking a wider nuclear confrontation by arming Ukraine in a ""proxy war"", while the United States and its allies now talk openly of helping Ukraine ""win"" and inflict a strategic defeat on Russia that will limit its ability to threaten its immediate neighbourhood. Like all major military conflicts, the Ukraine war is becoming an economic, technological and industrial confrontation, one with actions and implications escalating well beyond Ukraine. This week has seen suspected Ukrainian missile strikes on fuel and arms facilities within Russian territory, explosions and increasing talk of escalation in neighbouring Moldova and Moscow cutting gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, as well as Tuesday's meeting of NATO and allied nations on arming Ukraine further. On Tuesday, UK Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said Britain would have no problem with long-range missiles it was supplying being used to strike targets within Russia, describing them as ""a ""legitimate"" part of war. That produced a furious response from the Kremlin, including a warning to hit ""decision-making centres"" in Kyiv regardless of whether Western military advisers were there. Ukraine has not confirmed if it is hitting Russian territory. The global consequences of war, meanwhile, are escalating – particularly through the economic effects of rising food and fuel prices. With Russia bombing its railways and targeting agricultural infrastructure, Ukraine must bring in and export one of the world’s largest grain harvests between now and September. WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC SHOCK This week, the World Bank said the Ukraine war had delivered the largest commodity price shocks since the 1970s. In Europe, the price of natural gas has doubled while the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisations says food prices are at record highs. A Monday report by polling firm Deltapoll showed 90 percent of Britons saying they had noticed a significant increase in the cost of living this year, with 50 percent worried they would not be able to make ends meet within six months. In the developing world, it will be worse still, potentially bringing starvation and political upheaval. The International Monetary Fund expects inflation across the developing world to rise to 8.7 percent this year, up from an already painful 5.9 percent in 2021. Between them, Russia and Ukraine make up almost 30 percent of global wheat supply, almost all through now-blocked Black Sea routes. The Bank of America estimates lost Ukrainian supplies in the two months of war so far – down 80 percent – ""equate to about 10 days of world food supply"". That may get even worse if Ukraine cannot get its harvest in the summer, or if blocked exports and overfilled silos mean it cannot be stored. In March, the World Bank predicted the Ukrainian economy to shrink by as much as 45 percent, while even Kremlin-owned state media predict a Russian economic contraction of 10 percent or more. No one seems to be backing down. Tuesday saw the first meeting of the 40-nation U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Consultative Working Group, which U.S. officials say will now meet monthly to coordinate arms supplies. Following a visit to Kyiv the previous day, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin paid tribute to Ukraine for standing fast against Putin’s offensive. MILITARY SUPPLY BATTLE Since the invasion, the United States and its allies have committed around $5 billion in military aid, $3.7 billion from the U.S. alone. According to experts from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC, Russia may have now lost twice the 250 tanks it is believed to be able to build a year, while other estimates say it has used an even higher proportion of precision missiles and is now struggling to get the microchips for more. This month, one U.S. official told the Washington Post it was possible Ukraine now has more working tanks in service than Russia. The authorities in Kyiv, however, want more to push back Moscow in the Donbas, one of the reasons Germany’s willingness to provide Gepard tanks and anti-aircraft weaponry is so important. Those new tanks, however, may require months of training and ammunition from Switzerland -- not the only supply squeeze for Kyiv. This week, Raytheon, manufacturer of the Stinger anti-aircraft missile, said it must now look to restart manufacturing to meet demand – but that shortages of key chips and components might delay that process. Other kit, however, is being rushed out. On April 21, the Pentagon announced a new $800 million support package would include a ""loitering munitions"" kamikaze drone dubbed ""Phoenix Ghost"" specifically developed by the U.S. military for Ukraine in recent weeks. It did not provide further details, but other unmanned vehicles reportedly earmarked for first use in Ukraine include unmanned maritime vehicles previously unused in combat. With explosions reported on Monday in Moldova’s breakaway Transdniestria region blamed by Russian-speaking separatists on Ukraine, the war may yet widen further – Russia’s military has declared its intent to grab Ukraine’s entire coastal strip. Ukrainian officials say the Monday blasts – which targeted radio transmitters – bear all the hallmarks of a Russian “false flag” operation to justify more military action. For now, all sides seem to believe that they can win more than they have – with the next question whether that pushes Moscow’s calculus ever closer to the use of chemical, biological or small-scale nuclear weapons. The next month could be critical. *** Peter Apps is a writer on international affairs, globalisation, conflict and other issues.

4/30/2022,"Russia conducted a successful test of its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. Sarmat is the largest nuclear-tipped missile ever built, tipping the scales at nearly half a million pounds. The missile was likely built to overcome U.S. missile defenses, but such a plan is not without risk. Russia has tested the world’s largest and heaviest nuclear missile, the RS-28 Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The missile, which lifted off from northern Russia last week, weighs 458,000 pounds, or as much as 11 F-22A Raptor fighters. Sarmat can deliver up to ten thermonuclear warheads and has the range to strike anywhere on Earth. But as powerful as it is, the missile has distinct trade-offs that could make it less impressive than it sounds. 🇷🇺Today at 15:12 Moscow time, Sarmat, land-based intercontinental ballistic missile, was successfully launched from a silo at the Plesetsk state testing cosmodrome in Arkhangelsk Region. pic.twitter.com/xLsAUIDdIX — Минобороны России (@mod_russia) April 20, 2022 The Sarmat missile lifted off on April 20 from Russia’s Plesetsk Cosmodrome and delivered a warhead onto a target 500 miles away on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Russia’s TASS news agency, one of several government-controlled media outlets, quoted the country’s Ministry of Defense, stating: “The launch’s tasks were achieved in full. The designated characteristics were confirmed at all the stages of its flight. The practice warheads arrived at the designated area at the Kura proving ground on the Kamchatka Peninsula. “The new missile is capable of striking targets at long ranges, using different flight paths. The Sarmat features unique characteristics that enable it to reliably breach any existing and future anti-ballistic missile defenses.” (The Ministry of Defense website is currently offline to visitors from the United States.) TASS described Sarmat as “cutting-edge,” “powerful,” and a “breakthrough” weapon that will replace the Voyevoda ICBM (known to NATO as the SS-18 “Satan”) starting later this year. Here’s another perspective of the launch: 🇷🇺 Successful launch of Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile was held today at Plesetsk Cosmodrome from a silo launcher.🚀📹 Here is HD footage. pic.twitter.com/lzmygsolp8 — Минобороны России (@mod_russia) April 20, 2022 Sarmat is simply a large ICBM, the largest ICBM anyone has ever bothered to build. The three-stage, solid-fuel missile is 115 feet long and 9.8 feet wide with a total, fueled weight of 458,000 pounds. The missile can boost up to ten tons into low-Earth orbit, including, “Ten large warheads, 16 smaller ones, a combination of warheads and countermeasures, or hypersonic boost-glide vehicles.” Why is Sarmat so big? Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the U.S. several times that its missile defense capabilities put Russia’s nuclear arsenal at risk. Under the policy of Assured Destruction, the United States and Russia—and indeed all the nuclear powers—intrinsically hold each other hostage to a counterattack, or “second strike,” with no one side able to attack the other with nuclear weapons without risking being attacked in return. If one side with missile defenses, such as the United States, is able to defend itself from nuclear attack, other potential adversaries might feel less secure, worrying that the U.S. could launch a surprise attack and defend itself from the inevitable second strike. The U.S. does have limited missile defenses in the form of the Ground-Based Interceptor, designed to protect the nation from a limited attack from rogue countries such as North Korea. But the system has less than 50 missiles and could credibly defeat an incoming attack of ten missiles or less at best. For countries like China and Russia, each with hundreds of missiles, that’s not a problem ... yet. However, both countries have expressed concerns that the U.S. missile defense system could be scaled upward to handle many more incoming missiles. Here’s a 2019 Ground-Based Interceptor test that involved intercepting an ICBM-like target: Sarmat will be able to launch up to ten large warheads at once, and in turn present enemy missile defenses with ten warheads to deal with at once. The idea is that even if the defender has enough interceptor missiles to go around, missiles like Sarmat can overwhelm the defender’s ability to shoot down threatening missiles at a specific moment, allowing at least some to slip through. Sarmat’s long range, up to 11,184 miles, also means planners could get creative with how the warheads approach their targets, perhaps going around local defenses.  Sarmat’s huge capacity is a double-edged sword. If the missile encounters a mechanical problem and fails to launch, that’s ten nuclear weapons stranded in Russia and a large hole in Moscow’s targeting plan. Russia’s ability to use Sarmat will also be constrained by the New START arms control treaty, which limits both the U.S. and Russia to 800 missile launchers or bombers and 1,550 deployed warheads. Just 150 Sarmat missiles, each maxed out with warheads, could carry almost all of Russia’s allowable nukes, leaving just 50 for the rest of Moscow’s nuclear triad, including mobile ICBMs such as the truck-mounted Topol-M, Borei-class missile submarines, and strategic heavy bombers. The constraints of New START make it likely Russia will build only a limited number of Sarmats in order to beat down U.S. missile defenses, giving the rest of Moscow’s nuclear forces a freer hand. Is all this necessary? The U.S. has no stated intention of boosting the number of missile interceptors in its arsenal, and even if it wanted to, doing so could be astronomically expensive. For now, Russia’s nuclear deterrent is secure, but as far as Moscow is concerned, it’s better to be safe than sorry. The war in Ukraine will also make Sarmat more useful, though more as a political tool than a military tool. Russia’s military is also taking a beating in Ukraine, and its conventional forces will take years to rebuild. In the early 1990s, a period of severe economic turmoil in Russia, nukes were the only credible defense Moscow had. That time is likely coming again, worsened by wartime economic sanctions imposed by the West. Being able to boast about having the largest missiles in the world, whether that matters or not, will be the kind of chest-puffing that keeps enemies at bay. That is, if Moscow can afford it.

4/30/2022,"After purchasing 50,000 yuan (approximately $7,621) worth of chocolates to cheer up her classmates during lockdown, a Chinese graduate student was cyberbullied for “showing off.”

As Shanghai goes into its fourth week of lockdown, Chen Zhenzhen, a graduate student studying philosophy, sought an opportunity to cheer up her classmates after a university counselor encouraged students to keep a positive attitude.

“Chocolates are no substitute for meals, but might give them [classmates] psychological comfort and make them feel love from others,” Chen told Shanghai Daily via English East Day.

Chen, who runs online stores and has been a photographer for wedding events and other occasions, originally planned to use the money on a camera lens. Instead, she spent 50,000 yuan (about $7,621) of her savings to purchase a bulk order of chocolates from a local supermarket, reported the Shanghai Observer via South China Morning Post.

“It’s also the biggest purchase I have made in my life,” Chen told Shanghai Daily. “But I think it’s worth it because it can make so many people happy.”

After the university delivered the chocolates to students who were locked in their dormitories on April 4, the graduate student posted about her experience on Chinese social media platforms, where she initially received praise and gratitude. Students would send photos of the chocolates shaped as “Thank U” and Chen’s initials, “CZZ.”

 

The positive messages, however, quickly turned spiteful, as internet users began directing abusive remarks at Chen, with many accusing her of seeking attention and recklessly spending her parents’ money. The bombardment of hostile comments caused the graduate student to stay off the internet for a week after feeling afraid and heartbroken.

One internet user, for example, blatantly accused Chen of faking her kindness for attention stating: “You seem to be trying to seek the public’s attention, but why do you pretend to be a kindhearted person? Rubbish.”

A lawyer at a Shanghai law firm told the Morning Post that he believes the online abuse in Chen’s case calls for a lawsuit in accordance with a defamation guideline that came out in 2013.

The new 2013 guideline for anti-defamation laws in China states that if a hostile message is seen more than 5,000 times or is shared more than 500 times, then the individual may face up to three years in prison. The guidelines were created to help fight the spread of misinformation across the internet.

4/30/2022,"By Greg Torode, Martin Quin Pollard and Yew Lun Tian HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - From countering a Western ""information war"" during a Taiwan conflict to using ""shock and awe"" to swiftly subdue the island's forces, Chinese strategists are soaking up lessons from Russia's Ukrainian quagmire, diplomats, scholars and analysts say. Chinese military experts are discussing the conflict in private chat groups, offering their takes on Western involvement in Ukraine and Russia's perceived failings, say two scholars and four Asian and Western diplomats who are in touch with Chinese strategists. Although their conclusions have yet to surface in official military journals or state media, Russia's failure to quickly crush the Ukrainian military is a key topic - as are fears about how well China's untested forces would perform. ""Many Chinese experts are monitoring this war as if they are imagining how this would unfold if it happened between China and the West,"" said Beijing-based security scholar Zhao Tong of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Russia's approach in the early stages of the war did not subdue Ukrainian forces, which emboldened the international community to intervene with intelligence sharing, military equipment and the economic isolation of Russia. ""China probably should think about conducting a much stronger and much more comprehensive operation at the very beginning to shock and awe the Taiwanese forces to secure a major advantage,"" Zhao said, referring to observations from Chinese strategists. They believe securing that advantage would ""deter enemy forces from being willing to intervene"", he said. Singapore-based scholar Collin Koh said such an approach would create its own problems for China's People's Liberation Army. ""If you are going to 'shock and awe' Taiwan with overwhelming force in the initial stages, there might be a lot of civilian casualties,"" said Koh, of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. That would make occupation difficult and harden international opposition. ""The Chinese can't have any illusions now that they will be welcomed as liberators in Taiwan and given supplies and assistance,"" he said. Taiwan also has greater missile capabilities than Ukraine, allowing for pre-emptive strikes on a Chinese build-up or attacks on Chinese facilities after an invasion. Neither China's defence ministry nor China's Taiwan Affairs Office immediately responded to requests for comment. Russian forces invaded eastern Ukraine starting on Feb. 24, reducing towns and cities to rubble amid stiff resistance, losing thousands of troops as well as tanks, helicopters and aircraft. British officials estimated this week that 15,000 Russian troops have died; other sources suggest a higher number. More than 5 million people have fled after what Russia describes as a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and Western governments say this a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression by President Vladimir Putin. INFORMATION WAR Chinese strategists also worry about how Russia is contending with indirect Western military assistance, a factor China would also face in a Taiwan scenario, say two scholars and four diplomats. Chinese experts are privately arguing about the need for Beijing to better compete in the so-called information war, which has complicated Russia's position on the battlefield, Zhao said. Besides isolating Russia economically, Western diplomatic efforts - and reporting on atrocities in the war zone - have made it easier to provide aid for Ukraine and harder for Russia to find outside support. Zhao said that to Chinese strategists, one of the most important parts of the current conflict was how Western nations ""are able to manipulate, from their perspective, international opinion and decisively change the international response to the war."" Some Chinese strategists believe that the control of information has created a much worse impression of Russian performance than is warranted. ""There are a lot of discussions about how China needs to pay great attention to this information domain,"" Zhao said. LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES Some analysts note that the Ukrainian campaign was under way long before Russian forces invaded in late February, with months of build-up on the Russian side of the border. Those efforts were easily tracked by private sector open-source intelligence firms and repeatedly highlighted by U.S. and other governments. ""Taiwan would present a far greater logistical challenge than Ukraine, and to ready an invasion force on that scale undetected would be incredibly difficult,"" said Alexander Neill, who runs a strategic consultancy in Singapore. China's military leaders also have for decades looked to Moscow for not just weapons but also structural and command doctrine. Russian and Chinese forces have staged increasingly intensive joint exercises in recent years, including large-scale combined arms operations in Russia in September 2020. Strategic assumptions from this collaboration, however, are being tested. In 2012 the PLA adopted units similar to Russian Battalion Tactical Groups (BTG) - supposedly swift, nimble and self-supporting units. But Russian BTGs have become bogged down in Ukraine and proven vulnerable to attack. Russia has also struggled to coordinate the involvement of several military districts in the Ukraine war. Chinese analysts worry a Chinese invasion across the Taiwan Strait - widely seen as a far greater military challenge - would face similar problems, as it requires smooth co-operation across its recently formed Southern, Eastern and Northern Theatre Commands. Russia's forces in Ukraine have had command breakdowns and low morale. Analysts say it's unclear how Chinese troops - untested since they invaded northern Vietnam in 1979 - would perform in a modern conflict. ""We've seen signs of alarming indiscipline from Russian troops, which is a reminder that there is so much we don't know about Chinese troops would perform under the pressures of war,"" Neill said. ""For all the political indoctrination, we just don't know how resilient they would be.""
