4/4/2022,"Downing Street staff have been issued with fines by police over a party that took place the night before Prince Philip’s funeral, in the first decision by Scotland Yard that Covid laws were broken inside No 10 at the heart of government. After the Guardian revealed that fixed penalty notices were handed out to those who attended a leaving do for an aide to Boris Johnson in the Cabinet Office in June 2020, sources said those who partied into the early hours in No 10 on 16 April 2021 had also been warned they would receive fines. The event caused consternation due to the contrast between it and the Queen’s strict adherence to social distancing rules by sitting alone at the funeral of her husband of 73 years. Meanwhile, Downing Street staff were said to have got so drunk that they broke the swing used by the prime minister’s son, Wilf, in the No 10 garden, while a staff member was sent out to the local supermarket to pack full a suitcase of wine and another acted as a DJ. Two parties took place that evening – one to mark the departure of Johnson’s director of communications, James Slack, and another for one of Johnson’s personal photographers. At the time, England was in step two of the strict roadmap out of lockdown, meaning all indoor mixing was banned. Many of those who partied in No 10 on 16 April were sent questionnaires by the Met asking them to provide a reasonable excuse for their attendance. But in an email, the Operation Hillman team investigating the string of lockdown-busting events told some of them that it had been “assessed that there are reasonable grounds to believe that you committed an offence in contravention of the regulations”. The notification, which was received by some late last week, added: “In light of this, you are to be reported for the issuance of a fixed penalty notice (FPN), offering you the opportunity of discharging any liability to conviction for the offence by payment of a fixed penalty.” The Met said further correspondence confirming the details of the fine would be sent by ACRO – the criminal records issuing office. Downing Street declined to comment. No 10 apologised to the Queen in January after details of the parties were reported. The apparent confirmation that Covid laws were broken inside No 10 will lead to further questions over whether Johnson misled parliament about the dozen parties under investigation. He told Keir Starmer during prime minister’s questions on 1 December 2021: “What I can tell the right honourable and learned gentleman is that all guidance was followed completely in No 10.” Scotland Yard said it would not confirm which events fines had been issued for, or the identity of anyone who received a fixed-penalty notice. A spokesperson for the Met told the Guardian: “Unlike other incidents of Covid regulation breaches, the investigation under Operation Hillman remains ongoing, and as such we are not releasing further information at this time. “At its conclusion, we will review what information can be released whilst still working to the NPCC [National Police Chiefs’ Council] principle of not releasing information that will lead to any individual being identified.” Daisy Cooper, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the revelation that fines were to be issued for the 16 April 2021 event “confirms what the British public have known all along” – that Johnson was “a liar and must resign”. She told the Guardian: “The emotional images of the Queen sitting alone at her husband’s funeral were the hallmark of the British spirit through the pandemic. “Boris Johnson’s Downing Street didn’t show an ounce of respect for this country. There can be no more cover ups and no more lies. For the good of the country, and for all those who lost loved ones during the pandemic, he must go.” It is believed the fines handed out to those who attended the 16 April 2021 party were among those the initial tranche of 20 announced by the Met on Tuesday. The only two people No 10 have committed to identifying if they are fined is Johnson and the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, who had to be recused from leading the internal Whitehall partygate investigation after it was discovered a gathering was held by his team in December 2020. A Labour frontbencher on Sunday called for everyone fined to be publicly named. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, told Sky News that anyone who is issued with a fine – including the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson – should have their identify made public. “I think anyone who’s been in Downing Street should be named if they have been part of this. Because there’s been so much dishonesty, so much obfuscation from the people at the top in Downing Street, from the prime minister and his immediate circle downwards, I think people just want to know what really went on. Let’s have some transparency, let’s have some honesty.”",News/Politics,Fines issued over Downing Street party the night before Philip’s funeral,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/03/fines-issued-over-downing-street-party-the-night-before-philips-funeral
4/4/2022,"Antonio Conte declared his Tottenham team to be “now in the race” for Champions League qualification after they swept Newcastle away with a devastating second-half performance. Tottenham’s third successive win, and their sixth in eight, lifted them into the top four for at least 24 hours and the manner in which they cut loose to score five goals may look ominous for their rivals. Conte has urged caution about their prospects since being appointed in November, suggesting more than once that they are well short of the level required for Europe’s elite, but he has seen enough improvement to believe they have a realistic shot at finishing the season successfully. “When I arrived I found one type of situation and at that time it was very difficult to believe [we would] be in the race for the Champions League,” Conte said. “But I think in the last period I have seen my team is now in the race, because I have seen great improvement. “Now you can see a team that has specific characteristics. You can recognise the idea of football, and for this reason I said that we are in the race to try to take a place in the Champions League, because in this moment this team is a team. A team with an idea of football.” Conte went out of his way to praise Harry Kane, who was heavily involved in Spurs’ second and third goals but did not score himself, and said he wants to ensure the England captain is convinced about the club’s long-term direction. “He deserves the best because he’s a great worker,” he said. “He was a big example for his teammates. When you see him working this way, you have the desire to continue to work and to work very hard. For this reason I want to tell him thanks, because he is always a big example and I hope to give him satisfaction. I think he is enjoying playing this type of football and we have to try to continue together because I’m seeing great improvement in many players. Everyone is improving their level and for this reason Tottenham is going up and up.” Eddie Howe was disappointed by the way Newcastle, who had led through Fabian Schär, responded to going behind and said the defeat was a reminder that their relegation fight has yet to conclude successfully. “I’m being careful to not go too over the top with my criticism,” he said. “But we need to be smarter. It was in our desire to get back into the game. What’s to come is a key week for us. We’re in a position that we didn’t expect to be in. Maybe this is a little jolt that we can’t get ahead of ourselves.”",Sport/Football,Conte says Tottenham are in Champions League race after Newcastle win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/03/conte-says-tottenham-are-in-champions-league-race-after-newcastle-win
4/4/2022,"“I am enjoying watching the team,” wrote Antonio Conte in his pre-match notes. It would have been somewhat of a surprise if the Tottenham manager felt the same after 40 minutes of this encounter. Despite dominating the opening exchanges against a disciplined Newcastle side, Spurs found themselves trailing to Fabian Schär’s opportunistic free-kick and with a mountain to climb to maintain their hopes of finishing in the top four this season. Down on the touchline a furious Conte could barely contain his frustration as he stamped his feet. Luckily for the Italian, Son Heung-min was in one of his moods. Having needlessly fouled the lively Joe Willock on the edge of the penalty area in the build-up to Newcastle’s goal, for the next 15 minutes either side of half-time he set about making amends in clinical fashion. An inch-perfect cross which was gleefully headed home by Ben Davies for the equaliser took Son level with Aaron Lennon on 45 Premier League assists for Tottenham before Dejan Kulusevski returned the compliment just after the break for the South Korean to score their third goal. This time, Conte could not contain his excitement as he leapt into the arms of his assistant. When Son dragged an effort wide of the target seconds after Emerson Royal had made it 4-1 to the hosts with more than 25 minutes to play, it was hard to believe that this was the same team that had struggled to create meaningful chances before falling behind so meekly. At that stage it seemed obvious that, despite the promptings of the elegant Uruguay midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur, Tottenham were in desperate need of a player who is capable of opening up organised defences. Someone such as Christian Eriksen perhaps? It is a little more than two years since he left north London, having joined in 2013 as part of the splurge on players following Gareth Bale’s world record transfer to Real Madrid but at times this season that must have felt like a lifetime for Spurs fans. The Denmark midfielder was directly involved in 113 Premier League goals in his seven years at Spurs and still ranks inside the league’s all-time top 20 for assists on 63, one ahead of Newcastle’s former Peruvian stalwart Nolberto Solano but still five behind Darren Anderton. Eriksen’s performance in Brentford’s 4-1 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday was a reminder of why Mauricio Pochettino once described him as “the complete player”, with his goal rounding off an emotional week after also scoring in successive matches for Denmark. His exploits for Brentford have certainly not gone unnoticed in this part of north London, with Tim Sherwood, the former Spurs manager, urging Daniel Levy, the chairman, to bring him back for next season. “This guy shouldn’t be at Brentford. He shouldn’t be there,” said Sherwood rather dismissively of the club who have given Eriksen a short-term deal until the end of the season after his contract with Internazionale was terminated in October. “He should be at Tottenham.” Asked whether that could be a possibility a few weeks ago, Conte was polite but non-committal, although he did hint that a reunion with the player he signed for Inter could be on the cards. “To come back here would be a good opportunity for him, for me, for the club, but now he’s signed for Brentford, only six months, and we’ll see what happens,” he said. One big question would be how Eriksen would fit into this system, which is designed to get the best out of Kulusevski and Son. Along with Bentancur, the Sweden international’s versatility has been a major addition to the Spurs squad since he joined from Juventus in January, having already provided two goals and five assists. Harry Kane has also been forced to adapt his game since Eriksen’s departure and it was his combination with Kulusevski which provided the spark for Son’s game-changing goal. Kane can do pretty much everything these days, although tackling remains a major weakness on the evidence of his wild hack at Allan Saint-Maximin in full flight that earned the England captain a serenade of “You’re just a shit Alan Shearer” from the visiting supporters. One searing half-volley from Kane was destined for the top corner until it struck the unfortunate Emerson clean in the face. While Kulusevski and Bentancur were given standing ovations when they were substituted late on to allow Steven Bergwijn to wrap up the victory in style, the loudest applause at the final whistle was reserved for Son. More than seven years after joining from Bayer Leverkusen and with his contract extended last summer until 2025, the test for Tottenham and Conte is whether they can once again give him and Kane the stage that their talents deserve.",Sport/Football,Christian Eriksen could be missing link in Tottenham’s revived attack | Ed Aarons,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/03/christian-eriksen-could-be-missing-link-in-tottenhams-revived-attack
4/4/2022,"Chelsea returned to the top of the table in some style, putting five goals past Reading in front of a full house at the Kingsmeadow. Emma Hayes’ side played the late kick-off after Arsenal had also won by five goals against Leicester. Neither factor, however, seemed to affect their performance as they flexed their attacking muscles despite being without key players. Chelsea, buoyed by the return of fans in the stands, looked to reward their support from the onset in the form of an early charge at Grace Moloney’s goal. Leading the attack was the talismanic Sam Kerr, bouncing passes off Erin Cuthbert, and seeping through the gaps of Reading’s stringent back four. Without Fran Kirby, Pernille Harder, and Ji So-yun to supplement her play, the Australian instead depended upon the five-player midfield behind her to help fuel counters. One of the five was the in-form Guro Reiten, who had scored five times in her last nine games, and the Norwegian was orchestrating the play from her preferred position off the left. Liverpool will return to the Women's Super League next season after securing the Championship title with a 4-2 win at Bristol City. Goals from Niamh Fahey, Jas Matthews, Katie Stengel and Missy Bo Kearns secured victory in front of 5,752 supporters at Ashton Gate, a record attendance for the division. City were Liverpool's closest challengers, but defeat leaves them 14 points behind with three games left to play. 'We've worked incredibly hard to get back [to the WSL], said the Liverpool manager, Matt Beard, who led the Reds to the WSL title in 2013 and 2014. 'Our aim and ambition will be to be sensible, consolidate ourselves and then progress year-on-year.' Vivianne Miedema scored twice in a second-half flurry of goals, as Arsenal shook off their Champions League exit with a 5-0 win at Leicester. Beth Mead’s volley put the Gunners ahead at half-time, before Miedema struck in the 67th and 75th minutes. Ashleigh Plumptre turned a cross into her own net four minutes later, and Tobin Heath got the fifth goal late on. Manchester United kept up their push for a Champions League place with a 1-0 win over Brighton. Leah Galton scored the second-half winner in a hard-fought contest to help United move three points clear of Manchester City in third place.  Tottenham are 10 points behind United as their faint hopes of European football suffered a blow in a surprise home defeat to Aston Villa, Ramona Petzelberger scoring a late winner for the visitors. It was through her that Chelsea first got the chance to score from a free-kick. Reiten attempted a cheeky low shot which only narrowly missed the goal. Opportunities were few and far between, partly down to Reading’s attempts to snuff out the spaces for Chelsea’s attack to flood in to. It took until just before half-time before a similar chance would come, this time for Bethany England. The forward was through on goal but was forced to the byline and her shot blocked. That was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Moments later, Cuthbert looped a cross into the box that Jessie Fleming plucked from the sky before firing into the bottom corner to open the scoring in the 40th minute. On the other side of half-time, Reading’s response was to beef up their attack by releasing Deanne Rose in a free role, perhaps looking to replicate her goal in December’s match between the sides. However, when she last faced Chelsea, Hayes’ defence were in an experimental phase. There would be no waltzing through this time around, not with the hosts’ back three far more experienced in the 3-5-2 setup. In the 51st minute, England showed just how well that formation is working for her. She stole back possession on the Reading left flank and dashed into the box to receive an inch-perfect pass from Reiten which she volleyed home to make it 2-0. Reiten bagged her second assist of the game 14 minutes later, making the most of a mistake in the Reading back four to tee up, with some inevitability, Kerr, for Chelsea’s 25th goal in six games. The combination of a possession turnover, attack down the left and a Reiten assist would nightmarishly recur for the third time in the evening in the 76th minute. Reading gave away possession sloppily and Kerr converted in the box for her second, and Chelsea’s fourth, goal of the game. With a 92nd-minute penalty conversion from England to make it 5-0 there were no doubts about Chelsea’s dominant and convincing return to the summit of the WSL. The equation from here on remains simple: win the rest of their games and they successfully defend their title for the third year in a row. Hayes’ team returns to the Kingsmeadow on April 28 when they host Tottenham Hotspur in a rearranged fixture.",Sport/Football,Sam Kerr double helps Chelsea past Reading and back to top of WSL,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/03/chelsea-reading-wsl-match-report
