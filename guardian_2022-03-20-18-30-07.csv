3/20/2022,"Russian mercenaries fighting in Ukraine, including the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group, have been linked to far-right extremism including an organisation designated by the US as terrorist, analysis reveals. Although Vladimir Putin says his “special military operation” is aimed at the “denazification” of Ukraine, an investigation has found links between pro-Russian forces and violent rightwing extremism, including those directly affiliated with Wagner. One post on the messaging app Telegram, dated 15 March, shows the flag of the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM), a white-supremacist paramilitary organisation which the US lists as terrorist, allegedly flown by Moscow-backed separatists in Donetsk. The post was shared by a pro-Putin channel. Much of the extremist content, posted on Telegram and the Russian social media platform VKontakte (VK), relates to a far-right unit within the Wagner Group called Rusich with others linked to pro-Kremlin online communities, some bearing the name and logo of Wagner Group. Adam Hadley, the executive director of Tech Against Terrorism, a London-based initiative supported by the UN counter-terrorism executive directorate, said their analysis indicated that Russian-backed forces in Ukraine, including the Wagner Group, are “almost certainly connected with extreme far-right organisations”. Hadley added: “Given Putin’s absurd demands for the ‘denazification’ of Ukraine, we suggest he should first root out neo-Nazis in his own ranks before pointing the finger at others.” One of the most secretive organisations in Russia, the Wagner Group doesn’t officially exist. However, reports suggest hundreds of its members are fighting in Ukraine with claims shortly after the invasion that its mercenaries were operating in Kyiv with orders from the Kremlin to assassinate the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. It is also understood that efforts are being made by private messaging groups in Russia to recruit a new brigade of mercenaries to fight in Ukraine. Recently, the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, announced that 16,000 fighters from the Middle East had volunteered to fight with the Russian army. One account on VK is dedicated to the Rusich “sabotage and assault reconnaissance group” which appears to be operating in Ukraine, according to a post on 17 March. The Rusich logo features a Slavic Swastika known as a Kolovrat. Another recent VK posting lists Rusich as part of a coalition of separatist groups and militias including the extreme far-right group, Russian National Unity. One image shared on VK by a Rusich-affiliated account shows fighters, seemingly in Ukraine although it has proved impossible to verify, holding a Valknut flag, a symbol also commonly appropriated by white supremacists. It has been reported that mercenary units recruited to Wagner are being given names like “The Hawks”, possibly to steer away from the group’s reputation after repeated accusations of human rights abuses in its operations in Syria and Libya. The Tech Against Terrorism analysis found a prominent Wagner Group-affiliated Telegram channel sharing an image in May 2021 of the Kolovrat allegedly daubed on a cliff in Palmyra, Syria. It also found Telegram channels – named “Wagner PMC” in Russian – sharing footage and memes as recently as 4 March relating to the torture and beheading of a Syrian captive by Wagner mercenaries in 2017. The Wagner group was first identified in 2014, when backing pro-Russian separatists in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. It is owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, one of Putin’s closest allies, and has since conducted covert operations across Africa and the Middle East. Military experts believe that mercenaries allow the Kremlin – which has always denied any links with mercenary groups – to keep its death toll down. In an effort to control its narrative, Russia recently opened a criminal case against Facebook’s owner, Meta, accusing it of being an extremist organisation. The move by Russian prosecutors came after the the US tech giant temporarily allowed the use of terms such as “death to the Russian invaders”. Hadley added: “We condemn Russia for weaponising terrorism in this way and subverting international counter-terrorism norms.” ",News/World news,Russian mercenaries in Ukraine linked to far-right extremists,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/russian-mercenaries-in-ukraine-linked-to-far-right-extremists
3/20/2022,"The Metropolitan police was rebuked by a watchdog for conducting “unjustified” strip searches on children two years before officers performed an intrusive search on a black 15-year-old schoolgirl in a case that has sparked a racism scandal. Scotland Yard was forced to apologise last week after it emerged that the teenager, known as Child Q, was strip-searched at her school in Hackney after a teacher wrongly suspected her of carrying cannabis. An official investigation into the girl’s treatment, published on Monday, concluded that the search in December 2020 was “unjustified” and that racism was “likely” to have been a factor. The force was also criticised for its disproportionate use of the tactic on black and ethnic minority suspects in a 2019 report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, which found that not all the searches were “warranted or properly justified”. While the inspectors’ report related to searches in custody suites, it mirrors the findings of the investigation into the case of Child Q. Published in January 2019, it was based on an unannounced inspection of 15 custody suites in London in 2018 and found that 10,278 people were strip-searched in a 12-month period, amounting to 16% of detainees. Inspectors said the figure was “higher than we normally see”, adding that those subject to searches included “many children and a significantly higher proportion of black and minority ethnic detainees”. “We concluded that overall not all strip searches were warranted or properly justified,” they wrote. The investigation into the Child Q case by the City & Hackney Safeguarding Children Partnership raised similar concerns, also finding that there had been “no reasonable justification” for that search. “The review panel held a firm view that had Child Q not been black, then her experiences are unlikely to have been the same,” it added. Temi Mwale, founder of the campaign group 4Front, called for an end to strip searches on children altogether, and said police had “clearly not” learned from past warnings about their overuse of the tactic. “The power is being abused and so it needs to be taken away,” she said. She added that strip searches could be deeply traumatic for children. “It isn’t just traumatic on that day. This experience stays with them. They feel violated, humiliated and degraded. It stays with them for a long time,” she said. The Met apologised for the Child Q case, saying it was “truly regrettable” that the search had been carried out. It said it understood that intimate searches had a significant impact on individuals and that they must be carried out with “respect and dignity”. It claimed the use of “More Thorough, Intimate Parts Exposed” searches – a type of strip search not carried out in custody – was very limited. “In 2021, the Met carried out MTIP searches in fewer than 2% of stop and searches. Under-18s make up only 6% of all MTIP searches,” a spokesman said. He said the policy for MTIP searches was being reviewed, adding that “all opportunities for wider learning” were “acted on immediately”. As well as criticism of the Met, the case of Child Q has led to fierce criticism of her school, with nationwide protests outside police stations. On Friday, video emerged of a large protest by pupils inside the girl’s school. In one video a pupil described the school as a “breeding ground for discrimination”. “School only functions as a place of education if we can trust the teachers to keep us safe. As long as we cannot do that, this is not a school,” he told fellow students. Ofsted, the schools watchdog, is being called on to examine safeguarding concerns raised by the Child Q case, with campaigners questioning why police were called in the first place. Ofsted said on Friday that it could not confirm whether further inspections would be conducted of the school – rated “good” in its latest inspection – because it had not been named to protect the child’s identity. Victor Olisa, former head of diversity at Scotland Yard, said there were “unquestionably concerns” relating to safeguarding and pastoral care for students. “There needs to be a real understanding of why the school called the police and why they allowed officers to search the girl,” he said. He added that the officers involved in the Child Q case were not “bad apples”, but part of a wider culture. “I think the Met created an environment where officers felt comfortable to behave in that way,” he said. “The only way we’re going to deal this is if we hold leadership to account.” Chanel Dolcy, a solicitor at Bhatt Murphy, which is representing the family, said Child Q had launched civil proceedings against the Metropolitan police and her school. In a statement, she said Child Q “seeks to hold both institutions to account including through cast-iron commitments to ensure this never happens again”.",News/UK news,Met rebuked for strip searches two years before Child Q case in Hackney,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/20/met-rebuked-for-strip-searches-two-years-before-child-q-case-in-hackney
3/20/2022,"I am not a fan of seaside towns in summer. I hate the crowds, the narrow, winding roads that trap you, so you can end up surrounded by angry second-homers ready to bust a neck vein in indignation at you daring to drive down a perfectly legitimate, if tiny, road and ending up having to do a 23-point turn in remorse, while they watch. But I love an English seaside town in winter. Thus it was that I found myself in North Norfolk’s Sheringham. I watched two steam trains pull in at the station, couple, uncouple, pull out again and douse the station with steam (‘Daddy, my Daddy!’ as Bobbie memorably said in The Railway Children.) It started to rain. Along the high street I cheered up at the sight of a ‘chocolate shop’ only to recoil when I saw the reality, which we need not speak of here. Luckily I found a Harris & James shop, we bought ice-creams – of course, this being winter – and I oscillated between the Salted Caramel chocolate bar, £1.85/48g or the Peanutty bar, £1.85/60g. In the end I opted for the latter, fooling myself that some protein would lower the glycaemic hit. Then we walked up Beeston’s Bump, the ‘alps of Norfolk’ as a friend later told me, which sits 205ft above sea level. Over yonder we could see the storm coming in, a huge black cloud being pulled across the skyline. Just time, I thought, to stand and look out to sea and eat the bar, barrel-shaped and coated in rich dark milk, the innards all caramelised milk and salted peanut butter.

3/20/2022,"It must have been heaven to be alive and watching dance in New York from the late 1960s until the early 1980s, when a group of young choreographers – Lucinda Childs, Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer and Trisha Brown among them – came together in the basement of the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village and rethought the nature of dance. I went there on my first trip to New York, to pay homage, and was rather surprised to find it was still just a church. I wanted plaques and statues and celebratory fireworks. Now, I just eagerly await revivals of the work, marvelling at the clarity and beauty their experiments unlocked. Because of their collaborations with other pioneers, the dance-makers came to represent an entire artistic avant garde and so their work often ends up in museums and galleries nowadays. Tate Modern is hosting an exhibition centred on Trisha Brown’s 1983 creation of Set and Reset, with set and costumes by Robert Rauschenberg, score by Laurie Anderson and lighting by Beverly Emmons. Around the display, a sequence of performances is being staged as part of the Dance Reflections festival. In the coming week, Candoco will present its version of this seminal work, but first up it was Rambert’s dancers who recreated its shimmering movement, full of little details of arched or slashing arms and stretched feet, but giving the sense of constant, serene flow. In addition to the structures floating over the action – a cube and two pyramids on to which a stream of black-and-white American news footage is projected – Rauschenberg provided gorgeous, floaty costumes. The whole effect is as fresh and wondrous as the day it was made; it lasts less than 30 minutes yet is so rich in scope and shape you could watch it for ever. The contemporary contributions from Dance Reflections, however, both seemed to turn down blind alleys. There’s something mesmeric about Katerina Andreou’s BSTRD, in which the dancer walks on, puts a skull-shatteringly loud techno soundtrack on a turntable and then starts to dance, in endlessly repetitive sequences of hops, skips, runs. Watching feels a bit like standing at a bar at a rave: exhausting, frustrating, not really going anywhere. But at least Andreou seems to have some sense of purpose. Christian Rizzo’s une maison remains stubbornly opaque. A cast of 14 group themselves into various tableaux; sometimes, they appear in animal masks; sometimes, they move vigorously; more often, they are still, heads resting often on each others’ shoulders. They change their clothes from greys to colours. The stage is dominated by a large, florescent light sculpture whose tubes intermittently judder into movement, altering the shape. There’s a pile of dust that gets thrown across the stage and went in my eyes and hair. I think it is about home, and homelessness, and friendship, but I really didn’t care. If Trisha Brown’s fleet movement represents contemporary dance at its most generous, this work by Rizzo seems deliberately alienating.

3/20/2022,"Introducing its financial results earlier this month for the fourth quarter of 2021, the community-based social networking platform Nextdoor reiterated its core mission: “Our purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighbourhood they can rely on.” It’s a noble aim that’s certainly gaining attention. The network was launched in America in 2011 and has enjoyed steady growth. But, as digital media consultant Martin Ashplant says: “The Covid pandemic and subsequent lockdowns supercharged that. Suddenly, the hyperlocal view on the world that Nextdoor offered became vital for many.” According to the company, the network is now used in over a quarter of a million neighbourhoods in 11 countries around the world. Yet users of the platform do not always cultivate kindness in a way self-help experts might recommend. By way of illustration, last week in my local Nextdoor group in west London, one contributor began a post in this fashion: “Had a black man knock on my door last night...” She went on to describe a scam in which the man asked for £10 to get to a hospital to retrieve a key – he was locked out, he claimed – from his wife whom he said was a nurse. The contributor said she gave the man the money and it was never returned. The responses were largely supportive, though several pointed out that the man’s skin colour had been used by the poster less as means of description than as a cause of suspicion. In turn, these people were denounced as “snowflakes” and harbingers of “political correctness gone mad”. The original poster was offended by the suggestion that she was guilty of racism, but after reading the post and the responses, you wouldn’t have wanted to be a black male walking through her neighbourhood, let alone one seeking any kind of community help. It was a small but not untypical case of how the platform works, which points to why it has been subject to criticism. There is a body of opinion that sees Nextdoor as weaponising curtain-twitching. Instead of creating community cohesion, these opponents suggest, it fosters animosity and division. In America, Nextdoor has been accused of racial profiling and creating an atmosphere, as one mayor put it, of “paranoid hysteria”. In a country where black males have been shot for entering white neighbourhoods, such accusations are not to be dismissed. Nextdoor responded to the criticism with more detailed guidelines and an increased number of volunteer moderators. But neither development has quashed the belief in some circles that the platform is routinely used as a means to pit the white and wealthy against the black and the poor. In reality, most postings on the platform have little or nothing to do with issues of crime or race. Missing cats, piano teaching or reliable drain-cleaners are the usual fare. It’s the place to go to when you want to give away household items, and during Covid restrictions it was frequently used to identify vulnerable neighbours and organise help. “It can be really positive,” says Rita Begum, a Labour councillor in Maida Vale. “People came together during the pandemic using it, and it’s good for charity and community organisation.” In many respects, it’s simply a digital version of those handwritten cards that used to be displayed in post office and corner shop windows advertising local handymen and yoga lessons. There is something genteel and reassuring, like the workings of a village fete, about neighbours asking what they should do with a broken kettle or organising a place to stay for a Ukrainian refugee. But the tone shifts to one of urban embattlement when the subject switches, as it frequently does, to crime. Reading through the notices it’s not hard to gain the impression that there is a malevolent army out there, working day and night to breach your security and walk off with your property. “It can give a bad impression of an area,” says Begum. “People should be made more aware of what they’re posting. No one ever seems to intervene. Nextdoor should be more active in enforcing the rules.” A couple of weeks ago, while casually looking at the app on my phone during a break from work, I was confronted with video footage, taken by a front-door security camera, of a man breaking into a nearby house. You could see him in close-up, as if he were deliberately staring into the camera. He wears a face mask, gloves, a sports jacket, polo-neck sweater and beanie hat. He looks through the letter box then turns to survey the street before removing a flat object – perhaps a credit card – from his jacket pocket. He takes about 15 seconds to open the door. It was rather like in a TV drama when a burglar fiddles mysteriously with a keyhole and the next moment he’s in. I’d always thought that was artistic licence, assuming the job of picking or jemmying a modern lock was a far lengthier business. I was wrong. “Do you know this man?” the poster asks, understandably upset at being burgled. You can’t see much of his face, but you can see he is black. There are no explicit racial comments, but one poster writes: “His whole ugly face is distinctive to me. He looks like he is capable of anything.” How do you moderate that? Another poster asks if it’s worth contacting a local paper. Of course, local papers used to be the medium through which people were alerted to crimes in their locality. Despite vivid, sometimes lurid, reports, they were and are constrained by journalistic guidelines, libel law and sub judice. In a way, social media networks like Nextdoor have replaced the role of local papers, delivering news almost as it happens, with instantaneous, unedited feedback. As Richard Osley, editor of the award-winning Camden New Journal, says: “There is an issue with the fact that the uploads on the app do not seem to be bound by any fear of libel risk. We could not operate in the same way. You see serious accusations made without the same rigour you’d expect from a team of journalists.” Another recent post on my group claimed to be gathering a legal challenge to a local GP practice. People piled in, most with their own nightmare stories of neglect and incompetence, naming specific doctors. The post was eventually removed, but not before some grave allegations were made. As Osley argues, if people seek their news from what is essentially street gossip and “nobody does the basic requirement of investigation and holding institutions to account – something Nextdoor can’t really do – then we will all be losers in the end”. That may be true, yet in an obvious sense Nextdoor is also an empowering tool. To be forewarned is to be forearmed, and the strength of numbers of neighbourhood users may help prevent a victim of a burglary from feeling isolated, particularly as there is little chance the police will be interested. But at the same time, the weight of participating voices can be misleading and distorting, as each person adds unverifiable anecdotes and contributes to what can sometimes seem like a vigilante clamour. In another case on my group, a poster put up a video of a would-be burglar who came to his door but failed to gain access. He notes that had he broken in, he would have been confronted by two mastiffs. Other posters take up the theme. “Kill! Go Mastiffs!” one comments, and many echo the sentiment. When a lone poster says the guy may have mental health problems, she is swiftly told: “Mental health or not, I catch him doing that outside my house and I will smash him to pieces.” A lot of this, no doubt, is letting off steam, a safety-valve for the angst of city life. But even so, it’s hard to fit it into the corporate narrative of cultivating kindness. Indeed, you could argue that Nextdoor is cultivating the very things it purports to challenge: hatred, bigotry, fear and suspicion. After all, no one ever went broke by stirring up that particular set of emotions. Which brings us to the business end of Nextdoor’s operation. Set up by a group of Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurs with venture capital backing, Nextdoor was valued last year at $4.3bn. The platform’s revenue comes from advertising – security systems feature prominently, along with local services. In that final quarter announcement that came with the “kinder world” message, total revenue was $59m, up almost 50% year-on-year, and a public offering realised a cash balance of over $700m. The phrase “surveillance capitalism” takes on another meaning here, with revenue being generated not as a consequence of digital companies spying on people so much as from people spying on each other. That Nextdoor is a player with ambitions to rival the largest social media outfits is underlined by last year’s decision from Facebook (now Meta) to launch Facebook Neighbourhoods, which replicates many of Nextdoor’s features. For Nextdoor to triumph over Meta, says Ashplant, it will need to continue growing users in a post-pandemic world and show it can turn a profit. To do this, he says, it will have “to prove it is able to effectively police misinformation and retain trust”. While communities evolve over time, they can also be rapidly affected by new social conditions. Like Facebook and Twitter, Nextdoor is inherently disruptive. Such platforms become part of contemporary life by displacing previous systems, customs and habits. In recent years in this country, mirroring more advanced trends in America, there has been a growing separation between the rich and the poor, a process whose logical conclusion is economic segregation, with the wealthy cut off and securely protected from the supposedly dangerous world beyond. It has been claimed in America that Nextdoor is most active in neighbourhoods not badly afflicted by crime, but in which there is an exaggerated fear of it. The company maintains that the network is used across all communities. Whatever the truth, a healthy community steadfastness against crime is easily parlayed into hostility towards strangers, outsiders, minorities, the poor and the mentally ill. In turn, that hostility can create a virtual gated community that, sooner or later, leads to the real thing. It’s a cycle that may prove profitable for the well-heeled and well-protected, and for those who service them, but it’s unlikely to make for a kinder world.",News/Media,Is media platform Nextdoor a friend in need or a vigilante nightmare?,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/20/is-nextdoor-a-friend-in-need-or-vigilante-nightmare
3/20/2022,"At the beginning of Elena Ferrante’s last novel, The Lying Life of Adults (2020), the narrator recalls a moment of shame from early adolescence that left her feeling permanently untethered. “I slipped away, and am still slipping away, within these lines that are intended to give me a story,” she writes. Describing herself as “only a tangled knot”, she says: “Nobody, not even the one who at this moment is writing, knows if it contains the right thread for a story or is merely a snarled confusion of suffering, without redemption.” The sense of self-estrangement, the ugly-beautiful imagery, the mood of anguish – these are the constants in Ferrante’s fiction, from her early first-person stories about desperate women whose lives are going to pieces to her Neapolitan Quartet that made Ferrante an international phenomenon – as well as the world’s most famous literary recluse. She has always been fascinated by the way reality is transformed into art. Who gets to tell whose story? What if the story I’m telling leads nowhere? Is fiction more truthful when seen behind a veil of lies? These questions of neatness and truth rear up at the beginning of In the Margins, a slim book containing four lectures written by Ferrante, but delivered by actors last year. Their subject? Ostensibly, the “pleasures” of writing and reading – though it rarely sounds that pleasurable. Ferrante has been acclaimed for her “singular”, “uncompromising” voice, and her “ruthless” honesty. But what emerges from the first lecture, Pain and Pen, is just how cramped and conflicted she felt trying to develop this voice. It was an agonising negotiation between a “compliant” style of writing that stayed “diligently within the margins” and a more “impetuous” approach, which allows “unexpected truth” to spill out on to the page. She traces her compliance back to elementary school, when she used notebooks with two vertical red lines to denote the margins. These margins become a metaphor for the tension in her writing between “careful” precision and a more “unruly” instinct, where the words “erupt” and overflow (she also likes to draw on volcanic imagery). “Beautiful writing becomes beautiful when it loses its harmony and has the desperate power of the ugly,” Ferrante writes. She feels the same way about her characters: “I become passionate about them when they say one thing and do the opposite.” Part of her struggle between compliance and unruliness was to do with her sex. Growing up in the “literary patrimony”, she was drawn to literature by men and initially tried to imitate their work. She was saved by a close reading of the Italian Renaissance poet Gaspara Stampa: “If, a lowly, abject woman, I / can carry within so sublime a flame / why shouldn’t I draw out at least / a little of its style and vein to show the world?” These lines reminded her to acquire her own “style and vein”. But curiously, it was Gertrude Stein who inspired the second phase of Ferrante’s career. Following the critical success of her first three novels, she felt imprisoned by first-person narratives and was convinced she would never write again. After reading The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas – which allowed Stein to write about her own life through the guise of her lifelong companion – Ferrante was guided towards the use of “the necessary other”. This helped her develop a new fictional voice embodied by Lenu and Lila. Indeed, My Brilliant Friend was initially called The Necessary Friend. The standout lecture of the book is Histories I, in which Ferrante explains how she sees her writing as a kind of “deforming” of existing literary forms. “Overload the genres with conventional expectations? Yes, but in order to disappoint them.” Her final lecture celebrates Dante and his “boldest creation: Beatrice”. In his depiction of Beatrice, Ferrante finds “the most intense desire of the writer and storyteller: the yearning to untie yourself from yourself … a flow of language and writing without feeling otherness as a barrier”. It’s not unusual to hear readers talk of how Ferrante’s novels have somehow got inside their mind. Despite its insights, I’m not sure this tour of Ferrante’s own mind offers the same rewards. The book feels uneven, tantalising in places, opaque in others. Her ideas can be distilled down into: powerful prose emerges from dutiful prose; all writing is built on the shoulders of great literature; the paradox of realism is it requires truthful lies; and it’s a real bitch to get what’s in your head on to the page. Ferrante can’t help but arouse intrigue and admiration, but I was left wanting more – ideally fiction.

3/20/2022,"Have you been enjoying the sunshine? Perhaps that’s a redundant question: it has been difficult to avoid the delicious grins on people’s faces, the exaggerated generosity in their manners, the readiness to smile at strangers. Even the traditionally uptight denizens of London have been seen to unfurrow their brows and actually catch each other’s eye. Something feels different. Something feels – and forgive me if I’m speaking out of place here – not completely awful. Nature’s good at that, of course. Give the lady her due, she always turns it around at the end of winter. In this part of the northern hemisphere we spend a good third of a year convinced that the world is cold, dark and possibly going to hell in a handcart, then out pop the daffodils and it’s like someone’s thrown us a surprise party but remembered only to invite our more cheerful, better behaved alter egos. Last week’s sudden transformation – the rocketing of temperatures from the bitter bottom of the thermometer, the dialling up of colour across sun, sky and surroundings, as if a nine-year-old got loose with the Insta filters – has felt more welcome than ever. None of us expected to emerge from the pandemic only to face, immediately, the terrifying horror of war in Europe. Against the grim grey images of smoking buildings that have dominated our thoughts and wrung our hearts for the past three weeks, the blossom and bulbs have, perhaps, seemed to bud more brightly than usual. The atmosphere of relief and release, in public spaces, has been palpable. Here was life finally giving us the smallest of breaks. Yes, you’d just received the email warning that your energy bills were about to go up by 100% – but just for a couple of days, you could turn the central heating off, and maybe even shed a layer. The streets were filled with unexpected sounds. The barely remembered noise of pubgoers spilling out on to the pavements for their after-work drink, and the tinkle of the never-too-soon-for-ice-cream van. The thrum of convertibles, decanted from the garage at the first opportunity. The creep of free-floating jazz covers from buskers who can at last dare to play without their instruments freezing to their fingers. We’ve been here before, of course. Two pandemic springs and summers have offered similar moments of collective relief. Everyone is wiser now, experienced enough to appreciate that one government minister’s back-to-normal is another government scientist’s false dawn. And, yet, there are genuine grounds for hope added to the mixture this time. The latest data collected in England shows that a case of Covid now carries a smaller risk of death than a flu infection, thanks partly to the less harmful effects of Omicron and partly to the population’s increasing immunity. There’s a notable increase in people’s confidence to mix indoors, and a visible decrease in the numbers of masks and face coverings we see on a daily basis. This is, without doubt, the closest that things have felt to the life we knew in 2019. It doesn’t have the feeling of a breakthrough, precisely, but it does feel like the gradual, groggy return to reality after an all-consuming bad dream. In fact, like a dream, some of us are already struggling to entirely inhabit the memories of what we’ve just been through. Last week, I visited my local library for the first time since it reopened, and the librarian told me that he couldn’t remember huge swathes of the past two years, whether because they were too nondescript or too traumatic to recall he wasn’t sure. Arriving back home, I bumped into a neighbour, and we talked about the sunshine and the fact we’d both be out in our gardens soon. We remembered Brian, the presiding spirit of our street, whose life had been claimed by Covid at the start of 2021. We talked of my neighbour’s mother, who died of the virus earlier this year, and of the lifelong friend I had lost, and the household we knew just up the road that had buried three members of their family. It was strange to observe, a little impassively, how our communal history is already absorbing such extensive losses. The that-was-then unreality of empty skies and specially built Nightingale hospitals may be receding from our outer consciousness, but there’s still plenty around to stoke our internal fears, whether that’s the invasion of Ukraine or rising costs of living. Statistics from the ONS show that adults in the UK are still reporting high levels of anxiety in their daily life; since the end of February, almost in line with Putin’s acts of aggression, those levels have begun to climb again, while overall happiness levels have fallen. We know – we’ve always known – that a happy-ever-after is not how a pandemic ends, and that both the mental health and economic toll would be considerable. Global events, inflation, energy crises – all of these things will only add to our worry. An Ipsos poll last week revealed that financial pessimism in the UK has regained its highest level since tracking began 44 years ago: three out of four people believe the economy will worsen in the next year. Only twice before have we been so gloomy about the future, and the last time was in the middle of 2008’s financial crisis. But maybe that makes this current spring-like sensation all the more vital to our wellbeing. The spirit of renewal is abroad, from the extravagant blooming of the magnolia trees to the diaries quietly but quickly filling with exciting new social lives.

3/20/2022,"Banger upon banger has preceded the release of Spanish singer Rosalía’s third album, Motomami, not least the ubiquitous La Fama, a meditation on fame on which Canadian R&B superstar The Weeknd croons in Spanish. Rosalía describes “motomami” as being “an energy” – one personified, perhaps, by female stunt bikers in the video for Saoko, one of those bangers. (Motomami is also the name of the artist management firm run by her mother.) Images of transformation like butterflies (mariposas) abound on what Rosalía reports is her most personal album yet. The album’s feminist slant is “implicit” and reggaeton – the Latin American style heavily influenced by Caribbean sounds – powers a handful of sassy party flexes, a first for this artist, better known for her flamenco background. Staccato rhythms figure heavily, maintaining this unconventional pop artist’s edge. All that energy is balanced out by heartbreak on quieter ballads such as Como Un G and a handful of tracks where Rosalía’s first-class voice is allowed to take more traditional flight. Best of all is Bulerías (a flamenco rhythm, but also “mocking”), replete with vocal fireworks. Some are overtly Auto-Tuned, most overtly not. Here, Rosalía emphasises her refusal to compromise, citing Lil’ Kim, MIA and flamenco artists Niña Pastori and José Mercé as inspirations.",Arts/Music,Rosalía: Motomami review – energy and heartbreak from a first-class voice,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/20/rosalia-motomami-review-energy-and-heartbreak-from-a-first-class-voice
3/20/2022,"There is something about singing in public that solicits everyone’s attention instantly and demands a reaction. It makes its own weather system wherever it happens. Even singing that is wildly off-tempo and off-key, like drunken karaoke, can’t be ignored. And when the singing is beautiful, it declares the singer’s emotional state and replicates it in the listener, gluing them together briefly in a moment of shared attention. We have seen and heard this in videos that have emerged from Ukraine in the past few weeks and gone viral. MPs lustily singing the Ukrainian national anthem as they returned to parliament. Parents singing folk songs to their children in underground stations to keep their spirits up. A young girl silencing the other occupants of a Kyiv bunker with a rendition of Let it Go from Frozen. Singing stops us in our tracks in a way that speech rarely can. I have always loved to sing. For most of my adult life, though, I have just sung to myself – in the shower, in the car, or along the corridors at work. Then, three years ago, I joined a sea-shanty choir. Liverpool, where I live, has a rich shanty tradition and our choir’s leader, Professor Gerry Smyth, is a leading scholar of the form. We were an unlikely crew to be singing these rough-hewn sailors’ work songs, meant to accompany the hauling of ropes on ship. Women outnumbered men in our group, as they do in most choirs, and none of us looks as if we could heave up an anchor. I get seasick on the Mersey ferry. But the sense of incongruity soon wore off, and I found, along with the two million other people in the UK who belong to choirs, that singing in unison and harmony with others is a joyful thing. We started doing gigs in pubs and bars, the first time I had sung for an audience since concerts at school. Writing, my only other creative outlet, connects with its readers one-sidedly and remotely. Mostly it generates polite interest or indifference, or any enthusiasm is long-delayed – as if you’d dropped a stone down a really deep well and heard, months or years later, the tiny splash of a reader’s response as it hit the water. When we sang, the response was instant. We woke up the room. And then Covid silenced us. Some choirs migrated online, with varying success. We had a couple of desultory meetings on Zoom, but soon realised that you can’t sing in unison because of the millisecond time lag. The urge to sing remained. So, to raise my spirits in the boredom and anxiety of lockdown, I started singing to karaoke backing tracks on YouTube. I soon acquired a weirdly eclectic repertoire, mostly governed by the singers (Frank Sinatra, Glen Campbell, David Cassidy) who sing in the same keys as me. On my daily walk, I would turn a corner and find myself singing full-throated to a startled-looking dog walker. It was worth the odd awkward encounter. Singing, I am sure, has got me through the last two difficult years. Its mental and physical health benefits are well established. It has been found to reduce stress, release mood-boosting hormones and increase the body’s tolerance of pain. Graham Welch, professor of music education at the UCL Institute of Education, has collated this evidence for more than 30 years. For him, the physiological and psychological effects of singing both derive from its status as a primal act, “interwoven with core emotional states that are central to the human condition”. When you sing, you feel your chest and head vibrating and the lungs properly filling and emptying. It reminds you that you are a living, breathing, sentient body, taking up its own space in the world and making its own noise. Amateur singers tend to delude themselves about how good they sound. A voice always sounds better to its owner than to an audience, because it resonates more sonorously through the bones of the skull than through the air. (This explains why we find recorded versions of our voices so thin and disappointing.) Still, I admit it: I like the sound of my own voice. The voice is the oldest musical instrument of all – and the most complicated. At root it is just an exhaled breath, the noise made when the air rising up from the lungs vibrates against the glottis, the V-shaped aperture between the vocal folds, before being modulated by the jaw, tongue, lips and teeth as the air travels through them. But really singing is done with the whole body, and every aspect of our carriage and posture affects it. Any bit of tension in the shoulders, chest or abdominal muscles, even locked knees or a sprained ankle, affects the sound that comes out of our mouths. That sound is your vocal tone, something as unique to you as your fingerprints. It might delight or mortify you, but you can’t be indifferent to it, any more than you could be indifferent to the face that greets you in the mirror. Like it or not, it is you. Even the most angelic-sounding voice still feels fully human, with its own knotty grain and texture, its own unreproducible flaws and glitches. The philosopher Martha Nussbaum argues that we measure aesthetic achievements, as we do athletic achievements, against the constraints of the human body. “Human limits structure the human excellences, and give excellent action its significance,” she writes. When a soprano pulls off those outrageous top Fs in the Queen of the Night aria from The Magic Flute, it astonishes and delights because it’s just, but only just, within the limits of human lung power and vocal range. Like Usain Bolt running 100m in 9.58 seconds, this kind of singing feels virtuosic, but still something that a mere mortal could do. In her book about singing, Naked at the Albert Hall, the musician Tracey Thorn points out what a mundanely technical business it is. “There’s more thinking in singing than you might think,” she writes. The singer must learn to breathe in all the right places and release the air slowly, take little top-up breaths where they can, work their tongue round the trickier consonants, and train their swallowing muscles, near the larynx, to sit still while the larynx does all the work. That swoon-inducing effect achieved by moving dramatically up and down the scale is a matter of managing what opera singers call the passaggio: the transition between the deeper and thicker “chest voice” and the higher and lighter “head voice”. I don’t much care for the bravura style of singing on The Voice and other TV talent shows, with its love of portamento (sliding up to the note) and melisma (using lots of notes on one syllable). It feels like singing as competitive sport, all vocal pyrotechnics at the expense of the words. And learning a song for me is about getting to know the words intimately, savouring them in the mouth before letting them flow into the melody and metre. It means going over the chewier diction, thinking carefully about stress and intonation, and noting where you need an extra breath to sing through a line break without breaking the syntactical sense. Singing every day is heartening because you can hear yourself improving. Almost without trying, I found my tone getting smoother, my range expanding and my breath sustaining for longer notes and phrases. As the pandemic wore on and the days melded into a homogeneous mass, singing gave my life at least some measure of progress and momentum. Still, I longed to sing in a group again. Group singing was one of the last activities to be released from coronavirus restrictions, because the respiratory droplets and aerosols that singers exhale are thought to make it high-risk. Even before Covid, singers would fret constantly about the state and health of their voices; throat-knackering air conditioning, dry sinuses, or that little tickle that might be a cold, or worse. Singers know that the voice is like life itself – a fragile, mortal, capricious thing that can falter and founder without warning. The lungs lose power as we get older, and the muscle fibres in the vocal folds become stiffer and thinner. The voice is the only musical instrument that is alive, and the only one that ages and dies with its owner. And yet this fragility is precisely what makes the voice so magical. The ugly and unreliable mechanics of singing, all that flapping around of laryngeal cartilage and muscle, are invisible. The voice has no proper home, in the body or anywhere else; it is pure action, existing only when released into space. So when it materialises in the presence of other people it feels like a small miracle, as if we were mainlining the contents of another human heart. To sing, as Joan Baez once wrote, is “to coast into the hearts of the people who listen, to tell them that life is to live, that love is there, that nothing is a promise, but that beauty exists, and must be hunted for and found”. Singing in public is as near as our disenchanted world gets to the “winged words” that the heroes of Greek epics speak, which fly like feathered arrows to pierce their listeners and leave them changed. At the end of March, our shanty choir will perform in public for the first time in over two years – the first of many more gigs, I hope. I feel like I’ve already wasted too much of my life just singing to myself. Now, whenever I get the chance, I will sing to anyone who wants to hear.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Hitting the high notes: the lessons of all singing from the same sheet,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/20/perfect-harmony-singing-with-others-is-a-joyful-thing-even-in-difficult-times
3/20/2022,"Few countries can be quite as dedicated to a good, or at least a frequent, cup of coffee as Ukraine. Even war, with nightly bombing raids and Russian troops committing atrocities just a few dozen kilometres away, hasn’t shut down supplies of daily caffeine kicks in Kyiv. Valentyn Kononeko, 22, offered to help out a friend at a stall in fashionable Podil district when he reopened on Monday. He is one of millions who stayed on in the city, by choice or by necessity, and is now trying to feel his way towards some kind of wartime routine. “If I have to sit around worrying about whether a rocket is going to land on me, I would rather do it here,” he said after dealing with a 20-minute queue of customers. “You have something to do, taking up some of your time.” Olena Osadcha, 51, an accountant, was picking up two espressos to go, determined to stay even though her employer has shut down. “I’ve always lived here, and I can’t imagine life without Kyiv,” she said. Like many in the city, she talks lightly of the Russian missiles that rip into apartment blocks every evening, including one recently just a few kilometres away. “To hold your nerve during all of this, you have to try to live your normal life as much as possible.” At least half of Kyiv’s population has left, its streets are dotted with roadblocks, offices are closed and pavements eerily empty. But those who have remained are often proud – and defiant. The city’s trademark trams are running regularly, now free for anyone who needs them. “I can’t leave my mum for long, so it’s good to be able to stock up between curfews,” said one shopper heading home with bulging bags. Many women were walking around with bunches of tulips, handed out by shops after flowers once destined for the city’s many florist kiosks were used to create a giant trident – the Ukrainian national symbol – in the centre on Friday. “Some employers picked them up from the trident, and we have been handing them out to give everyone something to be cheerful about,” said Yuri Melnyk, 30, working behind the bar at First Point cafe. Outside customers are sitting in the sun, stroking a husky. They even had a few freshly baked croissants left, made from dough frozen before the war, although it is likely to run out soon. At a nearby restaurant specialising in pastries from the western city of Lviv, which has mostly been coordinating community volunteering but still makes pies to sell to hungry locals, handmade luxury chocolates on display are also selling well, says Victoria Patichenko, 20. Customers now include armed men guarding the nearby roadblocks, but she looks as fashionable as she would have a month ago, when the streets were packed with drinkers each evening, not emptied by the nightly curfew. “Where should I go if I leave? I’d rather die here than go and have to come back to a city occupied by Russians,” she said. “I recognise the sound of the anti-aircraft guns at night now, and I know they are working.” Danilo Horlushko, 21, works at Rozetka, a Ukrainian chain of internet and real-life stores a little like Amazon. He’s still sleeping at home in an area of northern Kyiv which has suffered multiple attacks. He shares an apartment with his grandmother and grandfather, who refuse to go into a bomb shelter. “When they started shelling Obolon, I asked them to at least come into the corridor, where it is a bit safer. My grandma agreed to come, but said ‘let me finish cooking my pancakes first’,” he says with a shrug. In their 70s, they have lived through a lot of turmoil, and simply don’t want to leave home. “People are thinking more about their kids and pets, we are selling a lot of things for them, and also for soldiers. Things like torches, and memory sticks.” Some people are still coming to work simply because they have to. Marina Pshenkovskaya now faces a commute of up to four hours, because the metro runs so infrequently from her home in the outer suburbs of the city to the tobacconist where she works. She still has rent to pay, and a 13-year-old son to feed, so she is making the exhausting trek daily. She has been selling a lot of cigarettes, even after the popular brands sold out. “People smoke more when they are anxious,” she says. But stock will only last another week and she doesn’t know what she will do after that. Along the roadside leaving Kyiv, Tetiana Gudima set up a small stand to sell the tulips she grows herself. A landscape gardener, she used to own a flower shop in Kyiv but the war forced her to close. “I had a good, profitable business, but now it’s gone,” she said, as a customer stopped to buy a flower to bring his wife a little joy. “(I’m doing this) because you need to live somehow and you need something to buy bread.”",News/World news,"‘I’d rather die here’: coffee, flowers and defiance on the streets of Kyiv ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/id-rather-die-here-coffee-flowers-and-defiance-on-the-streets-of-kyiv

3/20/2022,"Stopping the spread of Covid-19 through public health measures remains vital to curbing the pandemic, one of Britain’s most senior scientific figures has warned. On the eve of the second anniversary of the lockdown that began the UK’s Covid response, Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, called for investment in next-generation vaccines and better access to vaccinations for poorer countries. Farrar joined several of the UK’s most eminent scientists in praising the extraordinary response to the pandemic by the clinicians, researchers and business leaders. But with Covid infections and hospital admissions rising across the UK, measures such as masks, social distancing and ventilation are key. “Progress made by researchers over the last two years has been remarkable, from delivering vaccines and treatments in record time, to the hard work of genomic sequencers tracking the spread of the virus and identifying new variants,” said Farrar. “We must ensure more vaccines reach low and middle-income countries while also investing in research into second and third-generation vaccines that give broader protection and block transmission. “Focus now needs to be on maintaining key public health interventions alongside vaccines, and developing and ensuring equitable access to new treatments and strengthening the supply chains for PPE and oxygen. Stopping the spread will help to break the constant and unsustainable cycle of reacting to new variants.” Another of the country’s most eminent scientists said Britain’s universities and private laboratories should be handed a permanent role in testing hospital and care home staff in the event of a pandemic, to avoid one of the main mistakes of the early response to Covid. Paul Nurse, the Nobel prize winner and director of the Francis Crick Institute, said that the failure to harness the equipment and lab expertise of workers willing to offer “public service” meant that testing capacity took far longer than necessary to set up, leaving health and care settings fatally exposed. “There was no imaginative thinking about how to get testing rapidly in place,” he said. “They simply farmed it all out to commercial operations, working from big Lighthouse labs, which didn’t have a chance of getting working in time to be of any use in the first round of the epidemic. “We cannot keep big commercial labs running like this for the next 10 years, 15 years, waiting for the next virulent virus outbreak. We do not have a sustainable system in place. Why not actually make use of exactly what we did, which is to identify a range of institutions around the country – universities and publicly funded research places like the Crick – so in an emergency you could activate a network very rapidly, relying on public service and not simply a commercial programme?” John Edmunds, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), also said that work should begin now on vaccines for the most likely candidates to provoke the next pandemic. “I sincerely hope that we will not need to take such extreme measures as lockdown again,” he said. He added: “One way to help reduce the chances of having to impose very harsh measures on everyone is to improve our surveillance both nationally and internationally. We must also invest in vaccine platforms and develop vaccines against a range of currently rare diseases that have epidemic potential, so that we can adapt them rapidly should we need to.” Last week the seven-day average for UK hospital admissions related to Covid rose above 1,700, with more than half being admitted directly because of Covid, the NHS Confederation said. Nearly 5% of people in England had Covid in the week ending 12 March, according to the Office for National Statistics’s weekly Covid infection survey. NHS staff absences have begun to rise again too, while emergency departments are also under pressure: in a seven-day period earlier this month nearly a quarter of ambulances in England faced a delay of more than 30 minutes before being able to hand over patients. “The single biggest lesson from this pandemic is to act early, decisively and globally to prevent problems becoming much bigger,” Farrar said. “At the heart of this is the need for solid, trustworthy, international cooperation, with focus on long-term solutions that will help us to achieve a meaningful and long-lasting recovery. “This means preparing for all possible scenarios when dealing with an unpredictable virus, not only for the easy outcome where we hope this crisis blows over. The global response can and must be better than what we have experienced.” Nearly two years after the first lockdown began on 23 March 2020, at least 185,000 people have died with Covid on their death certificate. More than 38.5 million people – or almost 58% of the UK population – have received at least three doses of the vaccines that were created, tested and delivered by scientists and pharmaceutical companies around the world. About 487m virus tests have been conducted in the UK, most of them at the network of Lighthouse labs that was built after successive governments had allowed the public health laboratory system to run down. Now many of the Lighthouse labs are also being shut down, as part of the government’s “living with Covid” plan. Some of the institutions that played a crucial role in advising the government how to cope with the virus are also gone. Sage, which was made up of some of the most eminent academics in the UK, has been mothballed, while funding has ended for many of the research projects that it relied on such as Imperial College London’s React-1 survey of infection prevalence, the CoMix social contacts survey and the Isaric-4C (Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium) information network that used healthcare records to discover Covid’s clinical features. Three months after it was established on 23 March 2020, the Recovery trial, based at Oxford University, had discovered that dexamethasone reduced the chances of death for the sickest patients, and has since established the effectiveness of three other treatments. Sir Martin Landray, Recovery’s joint chief investigator and professor of medicine and epidemiology at Oxford Population Health, said he “would not have thought it possible to go from a blank piece of paper to enrolling the first patient in nine days, to finding the first life-saving treatment within 10 weeks and for it to be made standard NHS policy within three hours”. Landray said he hoped the progress in how research is conducted would continue. “We cannot afford to go backwards. Recovery was integrated into the routine care being delivered in our hospitals, and there was a commitment to act quickly and minimise bureaucracy.” With NHS staff keen to continue, he added, it “could herald a new age for research, not just for this pandemic and the next but for other common infections such as influenza and chronic diseases” – if policy-makers invest and maintain existing staff and structures.",News/World news,"Public health measures are key to curbing Covid in UK, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/public-health-measures-are-key-to-curbing-covid-in-uk-say-scientists
3/20/2022,"Rishi Sunak is renowned at Westminster for his nice manners. One Conservative MP who lobbied the chancellor for a policy change, but came away empty-handed, says: “I have never been told to fuck off so politely.” For a people-facing profession, politics is populated with many characters who have the people skills of a hippopotamus with toothache. In an environment where it is often absent, charm can take you a long way and it has been one of the key drivers of the sensationally swift ascent of the 41-year-old chancellor. He looked close to reaching the very summit in the early part of this year when Number 10 was engulfed by the torrent of revelations about partygate. When asked whether he had confidence in Boris Johnson, some of his answers were studiedly ambiguous, he skipped a session of prime minister’s questions to put distance between them, and he publicly rebuked the next-door neighbour for attempting to use the crimes of Jimmy Savile to smear Sir Keir Starmer. When the Johnson premiership dangled by an extremely fragile thread, the chancellor was regarded as the man most likely to succeed by Conservative MPs, party members, pundits and voters. There has been a radical change in the atmosphere over the past three weeks as a result of Russia’s vicious assault on Ukraine. Partygate has been effaced from the headlines by a conflict that has become the all-consuming focus of attention. “The war is obviously grim, but it has helped Boris,” one Conservative MP told me recently. As he said this, his voice dropped to a mutter. He felt suitably sheepish to be sharing calculations about the Tory leadership when Ukrainian cities were being pounded into rubble. Yet, he is correct. Johnson loyalists and opponents alike think that the raddled king is more secure on his throne, at least for now. At the same time, the young pretender next door is confronted with challenges that make his position hellishly more difficult. That will be underlined this week when Mr Sunak makes a spring financial statement. It has been timed to coincide precisely with the second anniversary of the imposition of the first pandemic lockdown in the UK. Pre-Ukraine, the chancellor’s plan was to proclaim that Britain was bouncing back from Covid while boasting that his emergency measures spared us the tsunami of business collapses and unemployment many were forecasting at the outset of the pandemic. He hoped to be able to argue that we have left the dark valley and are heading towards sun-dappled uplands, while appeasing Tories who don’t like his tax rises with suggestions that he will be able to deliver tax cuts before the next election. That was the shape of his script until it was shredded by Vladimir Putin. One of the chancellor’s allies puts it this way: “Covid was receding in the rear-view mirror, and then – boom! – Ukraine.” The costs of essentials were already rising before the Russian invasion, but the effect of the war has been to turn inflation from a bad headache for the Treasury into an excruciating migraine. Ballooning prices for gas, oil, minerals and cereals are the most obvious, but not the only, components. Britons face the fiercest battering to their living standards since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s in the wake of the Yom Kippur war. Inflation is already approaching 6% and the Bank of England reckons that it will be running at 8% by June. A growing band of rattled ministers share the view of gloomy business leaders that it will hit 10% before the end of the year. This is a frightening terra incognita for many Britons and their politicians. This country hasn’t experienced double-digit inflation since 1981, when the chancellor was just one year old. “It’s going to be horrible,” shudders a senior Tory, who is old enough to remember how rampant inflation ravages people’s livelihoods, and thinks the cabinet has yet to appreciate fully the gravity of what is upon us. Britons are not alone in facing a brutal crunch, but Mr Sunak is unlikely to win the hearts of voters or the confidence of colleagues by telling them that Americans and other Europeans are afflicted too. Some ministers blithely contend that they can blame it on the Kremlin – “Putin’s price rises” – but that will have limited mileage. Politicians are paid to address crises, not to seek excuses for them. Treasury questions in the Commons last week was a final opportunity before the spring statement for MPs to make public pleas to the chancellor for remedial measures. The clamour for action was as noisy from the Conservative benches as it was from the opposition’s. Slashing duties on fuel would please Tory MPs, but also crimp the tax take and increase demand for oil. Cancelling the big hike in national insurance, due to bite on pay packets in April, would win the chancellor a lot of cheers from his backbenchers on the day, but at the steep cost of enfeebling his credibility and depriving the exchequer of funds earmarked for clearing NHS waiting lists and improving social care. There is a gathering cross-party consensus that Britain needs to spend more on defence, but no unanimity about what sacrifices should be made elsewhere to pay for it. Some of the most intense pressure on the chancellor is to do more to soften the blow of skyrocketing energy bills. He has self-limited his room for manoeuvre by setting his face against gathering extra cash from a windfall tax on the oil and gas companies, which will rake in bumper profits as a result of the war. There are plenty of precedents for this step. Mrs Thatcher and Sir Geoffrey Howe, neither of whom was anyone’s idea of a revolutionary Marxist, set one when they imposed a windfall tax on banks in the early 1980s. On top of the immediate demands to relieve the strain on household budgets, soaring costs present the chancellor with stark dilemmas about public spending. Welfare payments and spending totals have been set on wrong assumptions that inflation would be much lower. Without compensating action, that means an extremely painful reduction to the real terms incomes of public sector workers, a recipe for demoralisation and discontent. An inflation-driven degradation of services will return us to the austerity that the Johnson government was supposed to have abandoned. Allocating extra funds for public services and welfare to protect them from rising costs will go down very badly with the many Conservatives who think that the state has already grown too large under a Tory government. It will be a surprise if the chancellor does nothing for hard-pressed families, but the indications are that he plans to do the least that he thinks he can get away with politically. One of his parliamentary supporters tells me that Mr Sunak wants to “hang tough” because he thinks that many of the measures being pressed on him will themselves turn out to be inflationary. The Treasury as an institution is nervy about the resilience of the national finances. In his recent Mais lecture, the chancellor projected himself as a fiscal conservative who believes that government can’t intervene to solve every problem. He has been heard to argue that there is no sense in taking dramatic steps this week when there is so much uncertainty about the course of events. “He’s desperately hoping that something will turn up,” remarks one former Tory cabinet minister. The chancellor wants to delay confronting his toughest choices until the autumn budget, in the hope that by then things might look clearer and better. That is designed to sound prudent, but it is actually highly risky. Failing to take decisive action now will leave him exposed to the charge that he is a “do nothing” chancellor who fiddles while his fellow Britons are burned by the worst living standards crisis in a generation. A reluctance to respond will be contrasted with the speed and agility with which he moved to limit the damage of the pandemic. Then he surprised expectations in a good way by setting aside his ideological predispositions to do “whatever it takes” to protect the economy. His programme had its flaws, but for a lot of the public he was the chancellor who splashed the cash to save their livelihoods. His approval ratings sparkled so brightly that he became the most liked politician in the country – and by a handsome margin. The pandemic made his reputation. Misjudging the cost of living crisis will break it. Charm isn’t going to get him through this. However politely he says it, there will be nothing popular about telling suffering Britons to “fuck off”.

3/20/2022,"Last spring, I finally moved out of town. That makes it sound like I gave in after decades of edgy murder-mile living, rivers of piss, my children playing with syringes. I did a tiny bit of that back when you could still see blowjobs and drug deals from the window of my east London flat and not men in ironic Deirdre Barlow glasses selling rare succulents for £700, but mainly I lived in a quiet corner of Brussels. When I moved back to the UK, it was to a provincial city centre where I complained constantly, like those idiots who pay millions to live in Soho, then decide they don’t like the noise of people having fun. So after a year enveloped in the blessed peace of the outer suburbs, what have I learned? Well, after a lifetime of aching for the first frost, fetishising boots and boring on about hygge, I admit it: I was wrong about winter. It turns out that when you move somewhere with no insulation as an energy crisis starts to bite, no amount of woodsmoke-scented candles and hot chocolate will keep you cosy. When people recommend turning your thermostat down a degree, I laugh, my breath dancing spirals in the morgue-cold air: the modest number on ours is a mad aspiration, like me saying I’ll do a 7am yoga class. Getting out of bed (two duvets, blanket, electric blanket, flattened and grilled like a human panini) requires superhuman effort: I put my clothes on top of my pyjamas, so no skin is ever exposed, mummying myself in so many layers my arms stick out like a toddler in a padded snowsuit. It’s very sexy. The upside to this is the way the seasons mean more. We are all, surely, familiar with that profoundly true graphic describing them: winter, fool’s spring, second winter, spring of deception, third winter (“spring of personal betrayal” a SAD-suffering friend adds). Now, even in the snatches of fool’s spring, a suggestion of sun between bruise-coloured clouds, I press my pasty face against the window like the ghost of a Victorian orphan, hungry to see nature slowly coming back to life. Apologies if this bit becomes an idiot’s nature diary. In my former life, I was always basically pro-flora, except in hayfever season (that’s the one after “third winter”) and extremely pro-fauna, entertained by gulls, foxes, even, grudgingly, the rat that clung to my urban bird feeder with its determined little pink toes. Now, though, I’m perennially astonished and delighted by the evolving spectacle a little bit of wildness offers. I’m no gardener – the neighbours wince when they look over the wall – so I’m late to the fizzing, extraordinary anticipation that comes from every bud, every pale spike poking through hard earth and every pollen-dusted catkin. I get it now. Then there are the birds, my God, the birds. I didn’t realise spring had a playlist until I moved here: every day it’s earlier and richer, a raucous polyphony of seduction, aggression and the simple fact of being alive. Watching them is even better: like a superior Pokémon Go, the thrill of spotting something a bit different: lollipop-shaped, long-tailed tits, surely designed in some Pixar cuteness lab. But even the regulars are spectacular. The resident sparrows brawl, shag and shout like nightmare neighbours from a Channel 5 show. Starlings drop by in gangs, cocky and peacock-iridescent, with an eery, almost-electrical, click and whistle. A magpie keeps trying to carry a far-too-big branch up a tree, like an over-ambitious Labrador: how am I supposed to work when I can watch that? The blackbirds are best. I put seeds on my windowsill and multiple times a day I look up, watch a blackbird’s undulating flight towards me, feel the satisfying feathery whump as it lands and the thrill of getting checked out by a yellow-ringed eye. Walking the neighbourhood later on, when the sky gets that deeper blue or pink tinge, they sing on every fence and gatepost now, and in some primal part of me, I know it means spring – the real one – is coming. My heart lifts like it’s filled with helium. I’m happy, I suppose. I didn’t imagine happiness could be so easy and so close: a furred magnolia bud and a song at dusk between the MOT garage and the Spar. I hope it’s OK to say that. It’s hard to know what to do with happiness at the moment, when spring is unfurling east of here, too – flowers blooming, lambs being born – and two million people are missing their bulbs coming up, or the tree they like down the street blossoming. When it’s the backdrop to outrageous suffering. Poetry sometimes helps: William Carlos Williams’s Landscape with the Fall of Icarus is good on that dissonance of pain while the world goes about its perennial business. It was spring, it goes, “the whole pageantry of the year was awake tingling with itself”. But I don’t believe happiness makes you indifferent. It makes you aware of what it might be to lose a home, birdsong, the simple animal joy of being alive. Spring.
