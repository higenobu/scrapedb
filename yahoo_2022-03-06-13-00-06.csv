3/6/2022,"Sean Hannity suggested on his podcast that Russian President Vladimir Putin be assassinated. ""You cut the head of the snake off, and you kill the snake. And right now, the snake is Vladimir Putin,"" Hannity said. The Fox News host also floated the idea that NATO bomb Russia's military convoy. Fox News host Sean Hannity has suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin be assassinated and that NATO should bomb Russian troops, implying that this would help solve the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. ""What we really need in this crisis, more than anything else, is a worldwide condemnation,"" Hannity said on the Wednesday episode of ""The Sean Hannity Show."" ""And it's a simple new rule that if you invade an innocent sovereign country, and you kill innocent men, women, and children, you don't deserve to live. That's the bottom line."" Pretending to be someone else raising a point, Hannity said: ""'Well, Hannity, we have an executive order that prohibits assassination of foreign leaders,' and I'm like, 'You cut the head of the snake off, and you kill the snake.'"" ""And right now, the snake is Vladimir Putin,"" he added. Hannity was referencing a 1976 executive order signed by then-President Gerald Ford, which bars the US government from conducting political assassinations. The Fox News host doubled down on the idea of a Putin assassination in a tweet on Thursday, writing: ""I added that anyone who invades a sovereign country (even one with a history of corruption like Ukraine,) and kills innocent men, woman and children like Putin has, they forfeit their right to lead a country, and they deserve to be taken out by any means necessary."" In the same podcast, Hannity suggested that NATO bomb the Russians and take out the ""entire Mother Russian convoy"" in Ukraine. ""You know, if we can see on satellite imagery where the convoy is, I don't know, maybe some smart country, maybe NATO might take some of their fighter jets, or maybe they can use some drone strikes and take out the whole damn convoy. And then nobody takes credit for it, so then Putin won't know who to hit back,"" Hannity said. ""'Well, he's threatening nuclear weapons, Hannity, you're talking about nuclear war.' I'm not talking about nuclear war, nor would I support one American boot on the ground here. But at what point is this gonna end?"" he added. Experts told The Washington Post that an assassination of Putin or a NATO bombing would not resolve the crisis in Ukraine. ""If the Americans assassinate Putin, they will make him a martyr at home rather than allowing his cult of lies, impunity, arrogance, egomania, and inhumanity to undo him,"" said Steven Fish, a political science professor at the University of California at Berkeley, per The Post. ""There is no poetic justice in our assassinating Putin and doing so would not discredit Putinism in Russia and around the world."" Rachel VanLandingham, a professor and national security law expert at Southwestern Law School, told The Post that bombing Russia would only be a good idea if NATO is willing to enter into World War III. ""It is foolishly naive to believe that just because Putin doesn't know who hit him he won't respond with significant armed force against a NATO ally — look at the threats he's already made,"" VanLandingham said, per The Post.

3/6/2022,"The annual ritual is nearly here. The start of daylight saving time, which subtracts an hour of sleep, is fast approaching. The seasonal time change when we ""spring forward"" will occur on Sunday, March 13, a full week before the official start of spring on March 20. Daylight saving time begins at 2 a.m. which is the official hour to set all of our clocks ahead one hour. That's when local time will instantly become 3 a.m. and people lose an extra hour of time. Here's more about daylight saving time: It's daylight saving time not saving's or savings time. It's singular, no matter how people around you say the phrase. Since 2007, daylight saving time begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November. Previously, it had started on the last Sunday of April and ended on the last Sunday of October. Daylight saving time was not started to help out American farmers. According to timeanddate.com, daylight saving time was first used in 1908 by a few hundred Canadians in Thunder Bay, Ontario. But Germany popularized daylight saving time after it first set the clocks forward on April 30, 1916, to save coal during World War I. Daylight saving time became a national standard in 1966 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Uniform Time Act, which was established as a way to continue to conserve energy. The thinking was if it's light out longer, that's less time you'll need to use the lights in your house. Presently, Hawaii and Arizona are the only two U.S. states that do not observe daylight saving time. Neither do the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and Northern Marina Islands. In the past four years, 19 states have passed legislation or resolutions seeking to make Daylight Saving Time the standard time in their states, if Congress takes action, according to the National Conference of State Legislators. The states include: Alabama, Georgia, Minnesota, Mississippi and Montana in 2021. Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wyoming in 2020. Arkansas, Delaware, Maine, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington in 2019. Florida in 2018. California voters also authorized a change, but legislative action is pending. Massachusetts and Maine also commissioned studies on the topic. There's a similar bill pending in New York, to make daylight saving time the year-round standard. It would be contingent on a repeal of the 1966 federal law, and would only take effect if neighboring states went year-round, too. The New York bill hasn't made it out of committee. Daylight saving time is now used in more than 70 countries worldwide and affects over one billion people every year. The beginning and end dates vary from one country to another. Most phones and computers automatically adjust for the time change, though manual clocks need to be reset. It's also a good time to change the batteries in your smoke alarm. Daylight saving time will end at 2 a.m. Sunday, Nov. 6, 2022, when we will “fall back” and again gain an hour of sleep. Contact Victoria Freile at vfreile@gannett.com.

3/6/2022,"Phoenix Mercury All-Star and two-time Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner has reportedly been detained in Russia on drug charges. The New York Times reported that the Russian Federal Customs Service detained an American basketball player at Sheremetyevo Airport near Moscow after finding hashish oil vape cartridges in her luggage. The Customs Service didn't identify who was arrested, saying only that she'd won two Olympic gold medals. A Russian news service identified the player as the 31-year-old Griner, and a security video viewed by the Times shows a player that appears to be her. In the video, Griner is going through security wearing a sweatshirt and face mask, and then it shows someone, presumably a customs employee, remove something from her bag. According to independent Russian news agency Interfax, the arrest happened in February, just after Griner had arrived at Sheremetyevo Airport from New York. Via the New York Post: A drug-sniffing dog indicated narcotics in luggage, and when the bag was X-rayed, “so-called ‘vapes'” were discovered “with a specific odor,” according to Interfax, which cited the Russian Federal Customs Service. Griner hasn't posted on social media since Feb. 5. A statement released by the Customs Service says a criminal case has been opened into the ""large-scale transportation of drugs."" In Russia, a conviction on those charges carries a sentence of 5-10 years in prison. Griner has played in Russia during the offseason since 2015, where salaries are higher for WNBA players. Her reported arrest came several weeks before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, though Americans playing in Russia had not been advised to leave the country, with the WNBA continuing to ""closely monitor the situation."" Griner's agent has not yet released a statement on her reported detainment, but the Mercury released a statement on Saturday morning. “We are aware of and are closely monitoring the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia. We remain in constant contact with her family, her representation, the WNBA and NBA. We love and support Brittney and at this time our main concern is her safety, physical and mental health, and her safe return home.” The WNBA also released a short statement about Griner. “Brittney Griner has the WNBA’s full support and our main priority is her swift and safe return to the United States,"" a WNBA spokesperson said in a statement to USA Today on Saturday.",World/Yahoo Sports,Mercury center Brittney Griner reportedly detained in Russia on drug charges,https://news.yahoo.com/wnba-mercury-brittney-griner-reportedly-detained-in-russia-on-drug-charges-153753082.html
3/6/2022,"LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Friday that Russian soldiers had committed rape in Ukrainian cities. Kuleba did not give any evidence for his claim. Reuters was unable to independently verify the claim. ""When bombs fall on your cities, when soldiers rape women in the occupied cities - and we have numerous cases of, unfortunately, when Russian soldiers rape women in Ukrainian cities - it's difficult, of course, to speak about the efficiency of international law,"" Kuleba told an event at Chatham House in London. ""But this is the only tool of civilization that is available to us to make sure that eventually all those who made this war possible will be brought to justice,"" said Kuleba, who was speaking in English.
