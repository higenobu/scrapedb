4/22/2022,"Just as most Americans have caught wind of the BA.2 variant of Omicron — which overtook the original Omicron as the dominant strain in the U.S. less than a month ago — another possibly faster-growing version of Omicron is quickly making inroads. The new Omicron sublineage BA.2.12.1 now accounts for 19% of all new cases specifically sequenced for variants in the country, according to data released Tuesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. That means the strain — barely on the national radar two weeks ago — is now being identified in close to 1 in 5 newly-sequenced cases, up from 1.5% less than a month before on 3/19. Given that, Americans trying to keep up may be experiencing a form of variant whiplash.

Both are sublineages of the BA.2 variant, and thought to have a 23%–27% growth advantage over BA.2, according to the New York State Department of Public Health. BA.2 is thought to have an estimated 30% growth advantage over the original Omicron. New York officials announced last week, seemingly out of nowhere that “For the month of March, BA.2.12 and BA.2.12.1 rose to collectively comprise more than 70% prevalence in Central New York and more than 20% prevalence in the neighboring Finger Lakes region. Data for April indicate that levels in Central New York are now above 90%.” Then: “State health officials have determined that these highly contagious new variants are likely contributing to the rising cases.” At the end of the first week of March, the 7-day average number of daily new cases in the state was well under 2,000. By April 13, it was over 5,000, according to the New York Times, with the total number of new positive cases that day, according to state data, at 6,546. Since then, while case numbers have risen and fallen with fluctuating daily test numbers, the 7-day average test positivity in New York has risen from 4.6% to 5.9%. BA.2.12 is said to be made up of North American and European lineages, while BA.2.12.2 is said to derive its lineage from the USA and Canada, with some speculating the first case was identified in Canada. That may explain why it has taken off more quickly in the Northeast. CDC data released this week indicate that, for the three-state region comprised of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, BA.2.12.2 already accounts for the majority of new cases (52%). It’s fellow subvariant, BA.2.12, has not kept pace. Its numbers are now being folded in with those cases attributed to BA.2. The two together are estimated to be causing 46% of new cases, down from about 85% in data released just one week ago on the region. In the southwestern region made up of California, Nevada and Arizona, the new CDC data indicates that BA.2.12.2 is responsible for about 9% of new cases. Some states such as California, however, do not break Omicron data out into sublineages, a practice that made it hard to track the rise of BA.2 and is now making it hard to chart BA.2.12.1. But that state’s largest metropolis has released data that shows, as of April 2, BA.2.12.1 only accounted for 2% of its sequenced cases. That number is more than two weeks old, however. Since that date, cases attributed to the variant have more than doubled nationally. Given trends with the new sublineage, it’s a fair guess the same has happened in Los Angeles, especially since cases have been rising steadily in the same period.

",Business/Deadline,"Covid Whiplash: Now-Dominant BA.2 Variant Being Quickly Overtaken Across The U.S. By Yet Another Faster-Growing Omicron Offshoot, Says CDC",https://news.yahoo.com/covid-whiplash-now-dominant-ba-004116151.html
4/22/2022,"Corporate executives are demanding their employees come back to the office—yet a recent survey finds that the bosses are often staying at home themselves. Or, at least, working somewhere else. After two years of remote work from the COVID-19 pandemic, companies are trying to return to in-person work. Corporate leaders, from Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon to JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, are trying to use carrots and, increasingly, sticks to get their employees back to their desks. Even President Joe Biden is exhorting workers to start commuting again, saying that “it’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again” at his State of the Union address in March. However, a recent survey from the Future Forum, a consortium backed by Slack that conducts research on working culture, is finding that some executives aren’t walking the walk when it comes to returning to the office. Future Forum’s April 2022 Pulse Survey of more than 10,000 ""knowledge workers"" across the U.S., Australia, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.K. found that 35% of non-executives were now commuting into the office each day—while only 19% of executives were doing the same. Future Forum defines “executives” to be anyone in the C-suite, or those with the title of “president.” Future Forum found that just 21% of both executives and non-executives wanted to return to in-person work, which suggests that at least some non-executives who are back at the office don’t want to be there. Both executives and non-executives also reported that their work-life balance had deteriorated in the first quarter, although non-executives reported a decline in work-life balance at least five times greater than their bosses. Non-executives also reported worse scores when it came to work-related anxiety, which Future Forum called a “troubling double standard in who is feeling the pain of return-to-office policies.” Companies that publicly committed to bring workers back to the office have struggled to actually get their employees commuting again. Goldman Sachs, which initially demanded that workers return to the office in February, found that only half its workers showed up on the first day of the office’s reopening. JPMorgan is also letting half its employees work in hybrid or fully remote settings, despite CEO Jamie Dimon saying that work from home “doesn’t work for people who want to hustle"" last year. Getting the balance between in-person and remote work wrong could have dire consequences for companies. Future Forum’s survey found that workers dissatisfied with their level of flexibility are now three times more likely to say they will “definitely” look for a new job in the coming year.

4/22/2022,"A Chinese businessman was charged with torture and sentenced to 20 years in prison by a court in Rwanda after he was filmed beating a local worker who was tied to a pole last year.

Sun Shujun, 43, is seen in a video yelling at the Rwandan man hunkered on the ground and whipping him with a rope while other men in orange jackets watched.
 


Sun was arrested after the video circulated online in August 2021. He was later released on bail.

Renzaho Alexis, a Rwandan man who is considered by the court to be an accomplice in the beating, was also sentenced to 12 years in prison.

Judge Jacques Kanyarukiga said that Sun had “tortured the victims and issued corporal punishment with malicious intent, and this is a grave crime.”

While prosecutors accused Sun of assaulting four people, he only admitted to assaulting two workers. He said he beat them because he was “frustrated and fed up of them constantly stealing minerals.”

Witnesses told the court that workers suspected of stealing from Sun were tied and whipped.

Sun, a manager of a mine that produces cassiterite in the Rutsiro district, said that his two victims received compensation of more than 1 million Rwandan francs (approximately $1,000) and a reconciliation letter.

Prosecutors, however, argued that the victims only accepted his payments because “they were traumatized and afraid of him.”

In a statement, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Rwanda wrote, “The Chinese Embassy in Rwanda has taken note of the recent ruling of 20 years’ imprisonment by a Rwandan court regarding a Chinese citizen. The Embassy always asks Chinese citizens in Rwanda to abide by local laws and regulations.”

“Meanwhile, the Embassy calls for the case to be handled appropriately in a rational, fair and just manner, and requests the legitimate rights of Chinese citizens to be properly protected,” the spokesperson added. “The Embassy will continue to follow the case. The Chinese Embassy remains committed to promoting relations between the two countries and friendship between our people.”
