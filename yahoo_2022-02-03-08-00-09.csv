2/3/2022,"Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) has apparently had enough of Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley ― and doesn’t care who knows what he thinks of his fellow Republican. Spoiler alert: It’s not very nice. On Wednesday, Hawley criticized President Joe Biden’s decision to order troops to Europe as Russia increases its military presence on its border with Ukraine. At the same time, the senator asked the White House to drop U.S. support for Ukraine joining NATO, according to The Hill. Kinzinger wasn’t impressed by Hawley’s suggestion that America not support its ally, especially considering that he serves on the Jan. 6 select committee, while Hawley was seen raising his fist in solidarity towards a crowd of Donald Trump supporters ahead of the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6. And he didn’t mince words, calling Hawley “one of the worst human beings,” and “a self egrandizing con artist” in a fiery tweet, adding, ”When Trump goes down I certainly hope this evil will be layed in the open for all to see, and be ashamed of.” I hate to be so personal, but Hawley is one of the worst human beings, and a self egrandizing con artist. When Trump goes down I certainly hope this evil will be layed in the open for all to see, and be ashamed of. https://t.co/3LirLgeuMz — Adam Kinzinger (@AdamKinzinger) February 2, 2022 Kinzinger got some support for the tweet, but many conservatives mocked his misspellings and suggested his tweet was actually an endorsement of Hawley. The Missouri senator told Business Insider that he didn’t understand Kinzinger’s animosity. “And what prompts this outburst?” Hawley asked, before adding, “Weird.” Kinzinger agreed via Twitter that “we are in weird times,” and said the proof is a Senator like Hawley who seems “more interested in pleasing Tucker [Carlson, of Fox News] and playing to worst instincts than leading. Denying Jan 6th truth despite fomenting it, among other things.” It is weird. We are in weird times. Like having a Senator more interested in pleasing Tucker and playing to worst instincts than leading. Denying Jan 6th truth despite fomenting it, among other things. https://t.co/Uovrh172dh — Adam Kinzinger (@AdamKinzinger) February 2, 2022 CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Adam Kinzinger represented Ohio.

2/3/2022,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House and Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday urged the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to reconsider its plan to buy a new multi-billion-dollar fleet of primarily gasoline-powered delivery vehicles. The Environmental Protection Agency sent a letter to the Postal Service on Wednesday urging it to hold a new hearing on its 10-year contract with Oshkosh Corp that could be worth $6 billion or more to build up to 165,000 next-generation delivery vehicles. White House Council on Environmental Quality chair Brenda Mallory said in a letter https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/USPS_letter_02022022.pdf that EPA ""has communicated grave concerns with the adequacy of the environmental review that the USPS has conducted to date."" She urged USPS to complete a supplemental environmental impact statement. A USPS spokeswoman declined comment. USPS awarded a $482 million contract to Oshkosh's defense unit, which will make the next-generation vehicles, in February 2021 that could ultimately be worth $6 billion. U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy previously told lawmakers the agency was committed to having electric vehicles make up 10% of its next-generation fleet as part of its multibillion-dollar plan to retire its 30-year-old delivery vehicles. The EPA said USPS' proposed new gas-powered vehicles ""are expected to achieve only 8.6 miles per gallon (mpg), barely improving over the decades old long-life vehicles that achieve 8.2 mpg."" EPA said greenhouse gas emissions from the gas-vehicles ""will total nearly 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide"" over 20 years and the present value of the climate damages from these emissions would exceed $900 million. EPA wants USPS to first purchase the ""full minimum committed"" EV volume before purchasing new gas-powered vehicles and also purchase commercially available electric vehicles for some routes. The Sierra Club praised the Biden administration effort. ""Shifting to a 100% electric Postal Service is a no-brainer. Electric mail trucks will reduce noise, air, and climate pollution in communities across the nation, while slashing fueling costs,"" the environmental group said. Biden's spending and climate bill would award $6 billion for USPS to purchase electric delivery vehicles and infrastructure. USPS has said with the funding that ""all delivery fleet acquisitions could feasibly be electric by 2028, and a corresponding 70% of our entire delivery fleet by"" 2030 could be EVs. Mallory wrote Wednesday that the White House supports USPS ""using its existing resources, including its significant cash reserve or through a credit strategy, to invest in our nation's health, environment and competitiveness."" The contract allows for delivery of between 50,000 and 165,000 of the vehicles over 10 years. The USPS rejected a proposal from electric-vehicle maker Workhorse Group. DeJoy said last year USPS had agreed to spend $500 million on the next-generation vehicles to make them convertible to EVs from internal-combustion models at a future date.
