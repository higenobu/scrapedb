1/1/2022,"Lafayette City Court Judge Michelle Odinet resigned Friday, weeks after a video surfaced that depicted her using racist remarks as she and her family watched security footage of an attempted burglary at their home. “I take full responsibility for the hurtful words used to describe the individual who burglarized the vehicles at my home. I am sorry for the pain that I have caused my community and ask for your forgiveness, as my words did not foster the public’s confidence and integrity for the judiciary,” Odinet said in a letter submitted to the Louisiana Supreme Court filed by her attorney Dane Ciolino. Ciolino told HuffPost Odinet “understands that this is the end of her public service, but only the beginning of what she must to do to earn the forgiveness of the community.” Odinet confirmed the video, published by The Current on Dec. 13, was shot in her home. It depicts a television showing security footage of a burglary as several voices laugh and recap the incident while repeatedly using the N-word. Ciolino told The New York Times Odinet was one of the voices heard using a slur in the video. After the video surfaced, Odinet asked for “forgiveness and understanding,” claiming she had taken a sedative at the time of the video and had “zero recollection” of the incident. She requested an unpaid leave of absence before being temporarily disqualified from the bench. Ciolino told HuffPost Odinet, who has four adult children, is “humiliated, embarrassed and sorry for what she has done and the trouble that she has caused to her community.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

1/1/2022,"PARIS (Reuters) - France on Friday condemned Iran's satellite rocket launch and said it was ""all the more regrettable"" as nuclear talks with world powers were making progress, echoing concerns expressed by the United States and Germany. Iran said on Thursday it had used a satellite launch rocket to send three research devices into space, as indirect U.S.-Iran talks take place in Austria to try to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal. The satellite launch was in breach of U.N. Security Council resolutions, France's foreign ministry said. ""These activities are all the more regrettable as they come at a time when we are making progress in the nuclear negotiations in Vienna,"" the French foreign ministry said. ""We call on Iran not to launch further ballistic missiles designed to be capable of carrying nuclear weapons, including space launchers."" Iranian state TV showed footage on Thursday of what it said was the firing of the launch vehicle from the Imam Khomeini Space Center in northern Iran at dawn. The U.S. State Department said on Thursday Washington was aware of reports on the launch, adding such launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution enshrining the 2015 nuclear deal. A German diplomat said such launches could be used to test technology for ballistic missiles which in principle could be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Tehran denies its space launch activity is a cover for ballistic missile development. The 2015 deal extended the time Iran would need to obtain enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb - if it chose to - to at least a year from about two to three months, in return for a lifting of sanctions. The latest indirect talks between Iran and the United States on the 2015 deal resumed on Monday. On Tuesday, Washington expressed caution over upbeat comments by Iran and Russia about the talks, saying it was too soon to say if Tehran had returned to the negotiations with a constructive approach.
