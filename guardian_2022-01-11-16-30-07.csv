1/11/2022,"An audience wearing face masks sits around the edges of a nondescript room in an unassuming building in the centre of Nairobi. Sparsely furnished and decorated with a few posters advertising PrEP, a drug that reduces chances of contracting HIV, there is a low hum of excited chatter. Then the speakers crackle into action, playing Sweet Dreams by Beyoncé, and in struts Toyo, a 23-year-old transgender woman, wearing a figure-hugging sparkly blue dress accessorised with bright red painted nails and the ubiqitious face mask, in black. She walks to the end of the room, strikes a pose and struts back out. Toyo is followed by Miss K – or Kelvin, when not in drag – 24, who is wearing a red strappy dress, long black wig, fake Louboutin heels, and plenty of makeup.  Toyo and Miss K are in the Dolls – a group of gay, transgender and non-binary people who volunteer at Ishtar, a drop-in centre for men who have sex with men, and the venue for today’s show. For half an hour or so, members of the Dolls model an array of outfits on their makeshift catwalk and perform two lip-synced songs. The Dolls formed in late 2018 with four members. Now they are 35, an example of the growing confidence of the LGBTQ+ community in Kenya, where homosexuality is criminalised and people face stigma, discrimination and violence. Ishtar, which receives funding from the Global Fund, belongs to the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya which began in 2006 with six organisations under its umbrella. Now there are about 20 member groups, including some in rural areas, according to Peter Njane, Ishtar’s director. Njane says verbal abuse and discrimination remain but adds: “I’m seeing hope because we are seeing gay men out and about … A lot of changes have happened in this country.” Toyo, one of the Dolls’ founding members, first heard about Ishtar from a gay man in her neighbourhood. “I was excited when I was told about an organisation like that,” she says. “I thought I was alone in this world. In my village, everyone threw stones at me saying “You’re so feminine, you’re so this …” Volunteering at Ishtar, Toyo found a sense of community and began thinking about how she could spread the word. She had done some modelling and had a large following on Instagram, so teamed up with other volunteers and started experimenting with fashion, makeup and performing. Then she saw RuPaul’s Drag Race – a US reality television show that documents a search for drag stars – and was immediately inspired. “I saw myself in RuPaul – I could get into character, look perfect, everyone was happy. Then I got out of character and no one could remember me. It’s like you’re two people in one body,” she says. “We could only do these events, wear the clothes and makeup, at Ishtar. Outside, we are very different people.” It wasn’t long before people started asking to join the group. Kelvin first saw the Dolls perform in 2018 when he was studying at fashion school. He joined last year after he couldn’t afford to continue his studies. As Miss K, his first performance was lip-syncing to Whitney Houston’s I Will Always Love You in front of about 70 people. “I cross-dressed in school and in public, but I wasn’t as happy,” he says. “In Kenya, when you cross-dress, people say something is wrong with you. They pray for you to get demons out of you. I wasn’t doing it with other members of the LGBTQ+ community – people who know me, appreciate me for who I am.” He adds: “The Dolls support each other, mentor you. If there’s a problem, you can tell them.” Before Covid hit, the Dolls were gaining momentum and had started being invited to perform at other LGBTQ+ organisations and some private events. They had introduced an annual Miss Ishtar pageant. Despite problems caused by the pandemic, Toyo has big plans for the Dolls’ future. She wants to create a clothes line for their fashion shows. Currently, buying outfits, accessories, shoes and makeup is a challenge. Sometimes members get women to buy items, or buy in bulk and from charity shops to avoid unwanted attention, then customise outfits on the sewing machine at Ishtar. She gets messages from people across Kenya, from Mombasa and Kisumu, asking how they can set up their own version of the Dolls. “We are like a pilot project everyone is looking at,” says Toyo. “We want to make the Dolls stronger and an example for others, and have other branches. It is through these events that we create awareness; I hope we can go to the mainstream media where people will stop judging us on our sexuality and start seeing our talent, our ability to do other things … It’s about diversity, teaching other people about who we are.” The Global Fund and their partners provided transport for the Guardian in Kenya Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,‘I saw myself in RuPaul’: how Drag Race inspired LGBTQ+ Kenyans to find freedom,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/11/i-saw-myself-in-rupaul-how-drag-race-inspired-lgbtq-kenyans-to-find-freedom
1/11/2022,"Aformative trauma befell Christopher “Peacemaker” Smith when he was around 12 years old, and he’s never gotten over it. The psychopathic quasi-superhero (his power is mostly just having the body of star John Cena) leading the new HBO Max series spun off from the Suicide Squad franchise is reintroduced to us fresh off a four-year prison stint, but he’s really been locked in a state of arrested development since tweenhood. His is a world of rocket launchers and fleshlights, bong rips and dick jokes, junk food and cheap beer. He certainly has the boastful, non-stop libido of the newly pubescent, not just game for the odd barfly hookup or MMF threesome, but fully assured that his prowess could sow doubt in the staunchest of lesbians. His idea of wit is naming his bald eagle sidekick Eagly. He swears as if he’s just learned the words.  The eight episodes spent with this defender of justice – no matter how many men, women and children he has to kill to do it – are dialed into his same set of immature predilections, in tune with his description from showrunner James Gunn as “the world’s biggest douchebag”. Characters bicker with the juvenile circularity of kids who need to be separated, constantly pointing out the flaws in each other’s equally absurd logic. (Every episode reiterates the “why would someone put penises all over the beach?” exchange from its big-screen predecessor in some form, to diminishing returns.) The hyper-charged sensibility of violence treats each explosive headshot like one of the power chords in Wig Wam’s Do Ya Wanna Taste It, the theme song for the inexplicably lengthy opening titles in which the cast members all do a silly dance. The soundtrack favors this stripe of cock-rock, all hair metal and 80s-styled guitar lixx. In one of Peacemaker’s tenderest moments, he bonds with an agent over their shared love of Finnish glam progenitors Hanoi Rocks. That scene encapsulates the usual appeal of Gunn’s work, which tends to raise the low ceiling on the taste of adolescent boys through earnestness and pop-cultural fluency. Those virtues have yielded one of the more accomplished entries in Troma Entertainment’s canon of Z-grade cheapies as well as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, bringing greater proficiency to the bottom of the barrel and a looser sense of personality to the blockbuster. Caught in the awkward middle ground of quasi-prestige TV, however, his technique as a director lands in a less satisfying in-between, too polished to be schlock and too modest in scale to run with the superhero big dogs. Gunn works well in close quarters, the first season’s highlight sequences almost all being contained mano-a-mano fights. But too often, the televisual terrain proves inhospitable for him, as a storyteller and stylist of action. Like so many streaming series in recent years, with their odd run times and small episode orders, this one’s trying to fill its 40ish-minute installments with a feature’s worth of narrative. Peacemaker, his BFF Vigilante (Freddie Stroma, doing Rorschach from Watchmen as a huge dork), and his black-op handlers face a twofer of threats, the combined might of which still leave these episodes feeling padded and sparse. As the head honcho of the local neo-Nazi contingent, Peacemaker’s father (Robert Patrick) lands at odds with his monomaniacally driven son, and an invasion of the body snatchers plays out elsewhere in their Pacific north-west suburb of Evergreen. Assorted subplots checking in with such members of the squad as disrespected tech nerd Economos (Steve Agee) and newbie Adebayo (Danielle Brooks) go nowhere, their personal business offering more distraction than character shading. Cena himself is the show’s strongest attribute, his veiny musculature lending a much-needed weight to face-offs that falter when ramping up the plastic-looking CGI. It’s something like physical comedy that the bass has been cranked into the red every time he hits a wall or floor, letting us feel the heaviness of his elephantine body. He’s well-suited to the role as a budding comic performer too, his alpha-man-boy bluster the ideal fit for Gunn’s sophomoric hijinks. (Cena’s goofy bulldog self-seriousness brings to mind Danny McBride, a comparison that really clicks when that actor’s constant collaborator Jody Hill stops by to direct an episode.) In spite of his dedicated douchebaggery, Peacemaker’s a likable lunkhead easy to spend time with, the main raison d’etre for a series that dims whenever he’s not onscreen. He’s locked on to a serviceable shtick, even if its pull-my-finger gags worked better alongside an ensemble of equally colorful wackos in film form. At his best, he wears down our grownup defenses and taps into the Mountain-Dew-chugging, loogie-hocking teenage dirtbag laying dormant within all of us. Peacemaker launches on HBO Max in the US and Binge in Australia on 13 January, with a UK date to be announced.",Arts/Television & radio,Peacemaker review – John Cena mostly sells DC’s puerile new series,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/11/peacemaker-review-john-cena
1/11/2022,"Millions more people in China have been ordered into lockdown and Hong Kong has banned transit passengers from 150 places as China continues to battle outbreaks across several provinces a few weeks before the Winter Olympics. China’s national health commission reported 110 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases for Monday, including 87 in Henan province, 13 in Shaanxi, and 10 in Tianjin.  The cases in Henan, which include at least some of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, prompted the lockdown of five million residents in the city of Anyang on Monday evening. Anyang recorded 58 of the 87 Henan cases. At least two Omicron cases have been confirmed in the city in recent days, linked to an outbreak in Tianjin, about 500km away. Anyang residents have been ordered into their homes and banned from driving on the roads, according to the state news agency Xinhua. Non-essential businesses have been closed down. Also in Henan, Zhengzhou city has closed schools and kindergartens and barred in-restaurant dining, while Yuzhou remains in lockdown. Xi’an city in northern China is in its third week of strict lockdown, while Shenzhen in the south has implemented targeted lockdowns of some housing compounds and launched a mass testing drive. Across numerous Chinese cities, public and long distance transport has been reduced or suspended, including multiple flights from the US. Tianjin is of particular concern to authorities over its proximity to Beijing, and officials have pledged to fulfil the city’s role as a “moat” to protect the capital. The origin of the Omicron strain is eluding officials. Zhang Ying, the deputy director of the city’s CDC, recently said it may have been spreading “for some time” before it was detected. With the Winter Olympics just around the corner, there are mounting concerns and rumours circulating about harsher restrictions to come. On Saturday a 39-year-old woman was arrested for allegedly disseminating false information about plans to shut down the popular Beijing party district Sanlitun, and on Tuesday the Beijing organising committee rejected rumours of plans to close some or all of the city during the games. Deputy director Huang Chun said the Omicron variant was spreading quickly around the world but the “closed loop” system for athletes, employees and others attending was running “smoothly” and there was no need to adjust it unless there was an outbreak within it. In Hong Kong, where a relatively small number of Omicron cases have also been detected, authorities have reportedly planned to ban all international transit passengers coming from about 150 places. Bloomberg reported on Monday the ban would be extended to air passengers from “Group A” countries, which have been designated high-risk, from 15 January to 14 February. According to Bloomberg, diplomats, government officials, athletes and staff travelling to the Games would be exempt from the ban. China is under pressure to maintain its official commitment to a zero-Covid strategy which has been challenged by the latest outbreaks and Omicron cases. As of December officials claimed to have fully vaccinated more than 82% of the population. However there are concerns that Omicron has a substantial ability to evade immune responses and current vaccines are less effective. China uses Sinovac and Sinopharm, two domestically developed and produced vaccines based on inactivated viruses. Dr Daryl Cheng, medical leader for the Melbourne vaccine education centre, said there were concerns that these types of vaccines appear to have a higher rate of breakthrough infections with Omicron. “We’re stuck in a perfect storm at the moment where Omicron is significantly infectious, and in places like China where they may have a higher rate of breakthrough infections,” Cheng told the Guardian. “It puts the population at significant risk of infection … [and] if you’re going for Covid-zero it puts higher strain on resources.” Cheng said Sinovac and Sinopharm – like all currently used vaccines – were developed before Omicron appeared, and so it was expected that they all would have reduced effectiveness, as happens with vaccines against new variations of the flu, which are adjusted each year. “The question is whether or not further boosters of the same vaccine achieve greater effectiveness [against Omicron], versus needing to mix and match, versus developing a newer version of the traditional vaccine,” he said. “It’s a very complex and multifactorial discussion because you may not have the time or availability [to get it to people].” Some countries are giving a booster on top of citizens’ two doses with a different type of vaccine, often an mRNA type. China had indicated it would approve the mRNA vaccine developed by Pfizer for domestic use in 2021 but has not done so. There are no mRNA vaccines approved for use in China. Cheng said China may be developing an mRNA vaccine but Omicron was “spreading by the day”.",News/World news,Millions more Chinese people ordered into lockdown to fight Covid outbreaks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/millions-more-chinese-ordered-into-lockdown-to-fight-covid-outbreaks
1/11/2022,"Therapists dwell in the land of emotions. It is our job to receive the emotional tenor of our analysands, to follow their speech patterns, their repetitions, their haltings, speedings-up and silences. We endeavour to find the words to decipher the complexity and subtlety of what is wanting to be conveyed and understood. It is not a simple job. The therapist’s emotional capacities are stretched. We register a feeling in the person we are working with, such as fear. But it isn’t just fear; there is a tinge of despair that alerts us to a closing in, almost, a collapse and a freeze. Or we register anger, and simultaneously tucked into the seam of that anger is disappointment, a very different kind of feeling, but which, once recognised, can disperse the anger. Getting to the accuracy of the feeling allows for an emotional sigh of understanding. The feelings can be digested, and in time flow through and out of the body. Feelings, emotions, are profoundly physical. Whereas once it was thought that they were distractions from thought, we now know that emotions are precursors to thought and profoundly implicated in consciousness. Or, as the American philosopher Owen Flanagan argues in his new book, How to Do Things With Emotions: The Morality of Anger and Shame Across Cultures, emotions are things we do. How we enact them, he insists, what sense we have of them and their purposes, are culturally inscribed and made sense of through the communal embrace of the rules they enforce.  Flanagan is mainly talking about the attitudes that police society through instilling in children the correct ways to behave. In a long discussion on anger and shame, he makes an ethical argument – that we in the west need to turn up shame and tone down anger, because our society suffers from too much explosive fury and too little modesty and embarrassment about personal behaviour and desires. He visits the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra in Indonesia, where shame is the main instrument of socialisation. For the Bara people of southern Madagascar, it is parental anger that is deployed to show children what is allowed. Flanagan contrasts our libertarian view of anger, in which we feel free to let rip privately and publicly through trolling, road rage and sending intimate photos, for example, with more homogeneous societies, where anger is used to discourage antisocial behaviour and enhance respect. Being scolded, being shamed, is sanctioned by all as an accepted form of child rearing. In such communities, anger is not the expulsive emotion to which we have grown accustomed. For the Minangkabau, tantrums and protest are simply not tolerated. Children are taught to withdraw quietly to manage their shame privately. But lest you think we have re-entered bourgeois Victorian England, Flanagan contends that this form of control isn’t damaging. The emotional harm that we might imagine shame and anger cause are, he argues, eviscerated as the cultural prescription is internalised as conscience, as morality and rules for living. If there is a fair bit of naivety in Flanagan’s project, there is also much to be admired. As he deconstructs the forms of anger used by westerners, he seems delighted to turn back the clock, as if we could disregard the different cultural forces, including the anonymity of the internet slanging machine, the noise of Fox News, the radio shock jocks and various therapies that claim that anger requires healthy expression and shame requires deconstruction. He ponders the philosopher’s question: which ways of living are best in allowing us to step outside the imprisonment of our personal upbringings? He wants us in the west, in North America and Britain, to reject libertarian values and strive for emotions that enhance rather than splinter society. Reputation tracking, which Flanagan applauds, pertains to small groups in which transgressive behaviour isn’t tolerated because we are responsible to our community. That’s appealing, but it doesn’t reflect late modernity, in which such a group composition seems unrealistic and in which individuality – how I feel, how you feel – is highly valued. Many young people crave recognition – whether online likes or even negative responses – and the nature of these engagements is very different to the day-to-day encounters within our social groups. Ultimately, Flanagan asks this important question: what do emotions do, and do they do the right thing? His answer draws on his work as a philosopher anthropologist, an approach to which I am sympathetic as a psychoanalyst who often experiences herself as an anthropologist of the mind. Like him, psychoanalysts and therapists understand the individual mind as the sum of other minds and yet unique. We make sense of ourselves by reference to our personal and social behaviour. The American physicist and bestselling author Leonard Mlodinow’s new book, Emotional: The New Thinking About Feelings, in which he popularises the findings from neuroscience over the past 50 years, is of a different nature. Mlodinow shows, through reports of psychologists’ experiments and a series of quizzes, that recognising how much we are motivated by emotions allows us to be more thoughtful and present, more rational. Feelings are private, personal and social. Emotions are the building blocks of consciousness and thought. Both books argue that we should see this work of emotions as central to who we are and can be. Susie Orbach is a psychotherapist, psychoanalyst and writer.

1/11/2022,"He is the online shopping tycoon billed as the UK’s answer to the Silicon Valley tech titans – with a personal fortune put at more than £2bn last spring and whose penchant for displaying his toned torso at pre-pandemic yacht parties has anchored many a tabloid newspaper rags-to-riches story. Yet for Matthew Moulding – the founder, chief executive and chair of the e-commerce company The Hut Group (THG) – 2021 proved a humbling year.  The acclaim that greeted his company’s £4.5bn London stock market flotation in the autumn of 2020 evaporated in 2021, as parts of the City of London turned on the company that owns online beauty and nutrition brands including Espa and Myprotein, as well as providing e-commerce technology to firms such as Unilever. THG’s shares – which had soared after the group floated – slumped by 71% between January and December. That fall cost its investors, among which Moulding is its biggest shareholder, about £6.9bn in paper losses. The reversal has heaped yet more scrutiny on a business that has not been shy of giving critics targets to snipe at: group companies have made significant donations to the Conservative party; while THG cocked a snook at City convention prior to its stock market debut by retaining Moulding in both the chair and chief executive roles. The board also signed off a pre-flotation deal that saw Moulding acquire THG’s offices, warehouses and leisure facilities – before immediately becoming the company’s landlord by leasing those buildings back to the company for an annual rent of £19m. That property deal was frowned on by City figures at the time, but justified by the company on the grounds it cut THG’s debts. Yet some investor questions have lingered, including should the company have sold the buildings to its founder before floating? What was the exact value of that deal and the price paid? And why wasn’t THG more transparent about all the relevant numbers? The company does not seem to have explicitly disclosed how much the property portfolio cost Moulding. But a Guardian analysis of THG’s accounts, which pieces together figures in THG’s annual report, suggests the deal was worth £297m – but Moulding might not have parted with any cash at all. Instead, the entrepreneur could have waived £76m of THG shares he was due to receive, as well as taking on £221m of the property portfolio’s debts and other liabilities. The company did not dispute the figures. And if they are accurate, this could raise new questions for THG – because a £297m price does not appear to reflect the company’s own historical filings about the value of individual properties in the portfolio. THG published specific individual values for 14 of the 18 properties in the portfolio, in a collection of its own annual reports and Companies House accounts between 2015 and 2020. The historical filings suggest that, at those points in time, the 14 properties had values that add up to £295m – just £2m less than the figure Moulding appeared to pay for all 18 buildings. Of course, property values rise and fall. The value of each of the 14 may have changed. But what about the four outstanding properties in the portfolio? According to the Guardian’s calculations, their current value could be as much as £55m. They include a new 56,873 sq metre (612,180 sq ft) warehouse near Wrocław in south-west Poland, for which THG has disclosed it pays Moulding a rent of €3.7m (£3.1m) a year. Such a rent – the third highest in the portfolio – would imply a property value of about £50m, according to research on typical yields collated by the statistical website Statista and property firm Cushman Wakefield. THG says the building is worth £43.3m. Three further offices in Northwich, Cheshire, charge rents that suggest the buildings are collectively worth as much as £5m, according to financial and property experts. Richard Kleiner, a managing partner of the City accounting firm Gerald Edelman, said: “I agree with the Guardian’s analysis … presumably, THG can more fully explain the accounting so that the analysis can be interpreted in a different way.” Moulding has had a mixed relationship with followers of his company, and has criticised the City and financial journalists for their coverage and analysis, even going as far to suggest that he regrets ever having taken the firm public. At the weekend it emerged he has handed a dossier to regulators over what THG described as a coordinated attack on its share price. However, the entrepreneur has never fully explained why he became THG’s landlord just as the company joined the stock market, although last January the company said: “The transaction removed in excess of £200m of debt from THG’s balance sheet immediately which increases to in excess of £400m over the near term as THG completes its infrastructure rollout programme globally.” The online retailer also previously said that a chief executive acting as a public company’s landlord was “not unique”, while adding that the property sale “was agreed on arm’s length terms with the independent non-execs’ and professional shareholders’ oversight. Mr Moulding paid the market value as independently valued by a global top tier accountancy practice appointed by THG on behalf of all shareholders.” Even so, THG declined invitations to provide an on-the-record comment to the Guardian’s most recent questions in December about the value of the property deal. It said the transaction was completely lawful, had been concluded only after taking extensive advice from a range of property and financial experts and that the company disputed it had valued the 14 properties at £295m. It said the Guardian’s calculations were wrong, but did not respond to repeated requests to provide a breakdown of the individual property values. THG added that the portfolio’s valuation was assessed by “[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors] accredited experts, following the recognised ‘Red Book’ global standard”. Its 2020 annual report also disclosed that the board’s related party committee – created after the property deal had concluded – found “no significant matters … as part of this subsequent review [of the property sale]”. Still, THG would not respond to further questions about the identities of the firms it hired to conduct the “Red Book” valuations, or the dates when the research was concluded. Nor would it make clear its position on specific buildings, where seemingly legitimate questions about valuations remain unanswered. For example, the portfolio’s most valuable piece of real estate – at least from a rental point of view – is a new four-building development called Icon, which the company constructed at Manchester airport to “house 2,000 people and … focus on video production and photography to be used across THG’s and clients’ digital offerings”. THG pays Moulding an annual rent of £7.78m for use of those buildings, according to the company’s listing prospectus, which also calls the site a “state-of-the-art facility”. Meanwhile, THG’s 2019 annual report informed shareholders that the Icon buildings were “a £135m THG investment”. Those figures would imply a yield – or rate of return – of about 5.8% for Moulding, which sits in line with the market rate for properties predominantly rented on 25-year leases by a public company tenant, according to property and financial experts. However, THG told the Guardian that Icon was actually valued at £62.25m when it was sold to the company’s founder. It did not explain why the company would pay the tycoon the 12.5% annual return on his investment such a valuation would imply. Moulding has also pledged all annual profits from his THG property arm to charity, although the company has said that, because of the debt on the portfolio, it would be “barely income generating” in the first year. THG has said that it does not endorse any political party and has also donated to the Manchester mayor’s office and Labour-controlled Manchester city council.",News/Business,Matthew Moulding: the curious case of THG founder’s property deals,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/11/matthew-moulding-the-curious-case-of-thg-founders-property-deals
1/11/2022,"Polar bears snore. Perhaps not all of them, but certainly the hulking beast that slept near me, my wife, Nicola, and our two young children. Deep, growly exhalations, not dissimilar to my own, I was cheerfully informed by George, nine, and Lottie, seven. The nocturnal habits of the world’s largest land-living carnivore were revealed to us during a stay over at Pairi Daiza (Persian for paradise), a peculiarly beautiful zoo and botanical gardens in a most implausible location: deepest Wallonia, the Francophone and economically struggling region of southern Belgium.  Founded in 1993 as a humble bird sanctuary around the remnants of a 12th-century Cistercian abbey and a neighbouring stately home, today Pairi Daiza is home to 7,000 animals, along with the largest Chinese and Indonesian gardens in Europe, spread across 65 hectares (160 acres) of picture-perfect landscape. To put this in context, London zoo houses 16,000 animals on just 15 hectares on the edge of Regent’s Park. Pairi Daiza, voted Europe’s top zoo for the past three years by the Diamond Theme Park awards, the Oscars of the zoological world, is vast and ever-expanding. It was the park’s latest growth spurt into the Belgian countryside in the municipality of Brugelette, an hour’s drive from Brussels, that offered the opportunity for us to hear a polar bear’s nightly snorts. Two years ago, in recognition that its sheer size makes it difficult for even the most sprightly of wildlife spotters to cover in a day, let alone a young family, Pairi Daiza opened 50 rooms with views of the bears, wolves, deer and seals. Last year they went further. A new section of the zoo, entitled the Land of the Cold, was opened, complete with a further 50 bedrooms sharing glass walls with the polar bears, walruses, penguins and Siberian tigers. The new high-spec accommodation includes sub-aquatic rooms, so you can watch water-dwelling animals swim underwater and feed, all from the comfort of your bed, or indeed your own whirlpool bath. The rooms are not recommended for those who fancy a lazy start to their day, although the polar bears were courteous enough to keep their roars around us to a minimum. We experienced the snoring during a rather eerie walk, late at night, back from one of the zoo’s restaurants. But the new “immersive” accommodation has proven immensely popular, and it is easy to see why in a setting like this. Pairi Daiza is the “childhood dream come true” of former lawyer and financial consultant Eric Domb, 61, who is obsessive enough about the place to live in it, and keep a treehouse holiday home for himself among the red pandas. Domb is, to put it mildly, a collector. His favourite animal is said to be the elephant. The zoo has 23 – two African and 21 Asian – the largest herd in Europe. He also has a fascination with China: he travelled to Shanghai and brought over a team of landscapers to help build his Middle Kingdom world – home to five giant pandas – and Chinese garden, full of pink and purple flowering azaleas, camellias and maples. Visitors are advised that it is best enjoyed barefoot. On a trip to Vancouver, Domb spotted a Twin Beech seaplane that he thought would inspire his guests. After multiple stops, the plane arrived in 2015 at Lac de la Plate Taille, south of Charleroi, the only water surface in Belgium big enough for the landing, before being transported to sit alongside the zoo’s lake, where it is a cause of curiosity for both the visitors and the harbour seals that live in that part of the zoo. Like many theme parks, Pairi Daiza has a train encircling it, but this one is run by a fully functioning, early-20th-century steam engine salvaged from Poland that whistles along at a pace just on the right side of alarming. Zoos need to work hard to justify their existence, and the image of an eccentric Belgian collecting baubles from around the world for a European audience could be offputting to some. I arrived as a zoo-sceptic, and my son wanted to know where the animals had been taken from. But the stated purpose of Pairi Daiza is to save species from extinction and introduce them into the wild if possible, while seeking to educate visitors about the wider culture of the lands the animals originate from – and why all of that matters. The zoo has been a member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquariums since 1994, coordinating breeding programmes for endangered species to ensure a healthy gene pool. There are fewer than 26,000 polar bears in the wild, with numbers diminishing quickly as their sea-ice habitat shrinks. Pairi Daiza is currently introducing two males and two females. The NGO Polar Bear International has granted the zoo “ambassador” status in recognition of its efforts. Scientific programmes include finding a cure for elephant herpes and inventing a pregnancy test for pandas. It is also a place of refuge. Two underweight walruses recently arrived from a zoo in St Petersburg that closed during the pandemic, and they are now doing well. This autumn, the local media was full of a story about a stowaway racoon offered a home after being found onboard the Dutch freighter Singelgracht on its return from a trip to Baltimore. Last year, 477 turtles, snakes, lizards and caiman crocodiles, discovered by border control or left abandoned by owners, were taken in by the zoo’s Mersus Emergo, a former whaling ship anchored by the lake as accommodation for the park’s reptiles and amphibians. There is no set route around the park – guests are encouraged to get a little lost, find something new. Waterways or steep landscapes are used wherever possible as a means to parcel off enclosures. As we arrived, and a flock of pelicans soared overhead, my first impression was of something akin to Jurassic Park, albeit with a brewery and a replica wood-framed Taoist temple that serves Chinese food, as two of nine catering outlets. As part of the accommodation package, visitors have two full days of access to the park, which we fully exploited. But we will have to return. There was simply too much we did not have time to see or, indeed, hear. I wonder if Siberian tigers snore? The trip was provided by Pairi Daiza: Le Jardin des Mondes.

1/11/2022,"Alot of people, particularly at this self-improvement stage of the year, spend a great deal of time worrying about what makes them look old. Is it the bags under the eyes or the invisible triceps? This is daft, since, if you have a ring light or – better yet – are willing to pretend that your camera isn’t working, no one needs to know what you really look like unless they live with you (and those people have a fair idea already). The giveaway now is how you use your phone. You can absolutely carbon-date yourself in a single exchange. If you leave voicemail, that makes you a boomer, according to assorted experts. If you send a voice note, you are (spiritually, at least) a millennial, or even generation Z. This makes no sense, since, to your interlocutor, these are two identical experiences: an annoying taped message that they are burdened with listening to. However, if you query the rules, that puts you back in boomer territory.  If you trail off a text with “…”, this situates you right in the middle of generation X, but if you ask a younger acquaintance what is so wrong with ellipsis, you doubly age yourself, first by using ellipsis and second by knowing what it is called. Between two people over 40, switching from a text to a phone call in the middle of an exchange is a little infra dig, but not drastic. You might just be at a loose end. In the 30 to 40 bracket, to call anyone at all without scheduling it first is considered incredibly impertinent. To the under-30s, this counts as de-escalation – don’t intensify the tone, change the platform. Boomers answer their phone the minute it rings, like it is a smoke alarm. They could be in the middle of getting knighted, or being diagnosed with a terminal illness, and they would still go: “Ooh, unknown caller ID – could be important.” There is a generation above, sometimes called the “silent generation”, where they keep their phone in a drawer, forget it is there and might call you back a month later. This used to really bug me, but now I find it ineffably charming and nostalgic, like vinyl. Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,"Want to seem younger?

1/11/2022,"Karen Dejesus, 54, was cooking breakfast for her young granddaughter and her son when she heard fire alarms on Sunday morning in the Bronx borough of New York. Dejesus and her family have lived in the high rise apartment building for almost 19 years. Alarms in the building went off erroneously so often that residents on Sunday didn’t register the sirens as real, she told the Guardian.  “So many of us were used to hearing that fire alarm go off, it was like second nature to us,” said Dejesus. But when plumes of smoke and flames began to flood her third-floor apartment, the same floor the fire started on, along with screams of help from residents trapped inside, Dejesus realized the alarms were real. With no fire escapes on her Bronx high rise, Dejesus and her family had to escape through the window, aided by attending firefighters. “[You’re] in a building that’s burning and you don’t know how you’re going to get out. You don’t know if the firefighters are going to get to you in time,” said Dejesus. “Obviously, the building was not fireproof like we thought it was.” Over 200 New York City firefighters responded to the fire in the Bronx that killed 17 people, eight of them children, in the deadliest fire in the city in over 30 years. The five-alarm fire that also left 60 residents injured began when a space heater in one of the apartment units malfunctioned, said New York City fire commissioner Dan Nigro, and quickly spread through the complex’s stairwells and into other units via an open door. “Some of the kids that died, I knew. That’s what’s going through my mind over and over and over,” said Cookie Dennis, 72, who was on the third floor when the fire broke out. Dozens of residents were rushed to area hospitals, with 32 sent to five borough hospitals in life-threatening condition. Investigators confirmed that victims of the fire, often with severe smoke inhalation, were found in stairwells on every floor of the apartment complex, with many found in cardiac and respiratory arrest. Many residents who survived the fire escaped through stairways obscured with smoke or waited, hoping for assistance from firefighters. Dennis described how she waited in her apartment until the fire was out before getting assistance from firefighters. “After the fire was out and everything was set, they knocked on the doors and said, ‘Can you breathe? Are you breathing in there?” said Dennis. Dennis, who mostly lives alone, was only able to take her medication after the blaze, leaving nearly all of her belongings behind while she stays at a friend’s home temporarily. “The smoke was still so bad and it was pitch black and there were wires hanging and water [everywhere],” said Dennis. “It looks like a war zone,” said Dejesus. Support from neighbors in this tight-knit community has been overwhelming, as donations of money, food, clothing and other supplies have poured in for residents in need. “I think that the community is really, really coming together,” said Keisha Sillah who visited the site of the fire on Monday to see where she could donate supplies for impacted residents. “A lot of people are devastated because some way or another, you know someone from someone.” Elizabeth Fermin, 54, who lives across the street from where the fire broke out, has donated several bags of clothing from a store her son owns to victims of the fire, directing other neighbors interested in helping to donation drop-off points around the neighborhood on Monday. “It’s very sad cause I just go on the news to see if I recognize one of my friends,” said Fermin. “I know a lot of people from there. I got a lot of friends there.” Fermin has lived in the neighborhood for nearly 22 years, often donating clothes and toys to residents who would stop by. She watched the fire from her apartment window as first responders rescued people trapped inside, including several young children and infants. “I feel sorry for them. I’ve got pain in my heart since yesterday. I’ve never seen nothing like that. I’ve seen fire, but not like that,” said Fermin. As affected residents recover from the blaze and search for housing and resources in the coming days, many are grateful that they survived the fire, but anxiously wait on word of how their neighbors fared. “I just thank God that we’re here,” said Dejesus.",News/US news,‘It looks like a war zone’: horror as Bronx apartment building went up in flames,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/11/bronx-fire-apartment-building-new-york-city
1/11/2022,"A group of North Carolina voters told state officials on Monday that they want Republican congressman Madison Cawthorn to be disqualified as a congressional candidate, citing his involvement in the 6 January attack on the Capitol. Cawthorn questioned the outcome of the presidential election during the “Save America Rally” before the Capitol riot later that day that resulted in five deaths.  At the rally, Cawthorn made baseless claims that the election had been stolen from Donald Trump, and has been accused of firing up the crowd, many of whom went on to storm the Capitol. Lawyers filed the candidacy challenge on behalf of 11 voters with North Carolina’s board of elections, which oversees a process by which candidate qualifications are scrutinized. The voters say Cawthorn, who formally filed as a candidate last month, cannot run because he fails to comply with an amendment in the constitution ratified shortly after the civil war. The 1868 amendment says no one can serve in Congress “who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress … to support the constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same”. The written challenge says the events on 6 January “amounted to an insurrection”, and that Cawthorn’s speech at the rally supporting Trump, his other comments, and information in published reports, provide a “reasonable suspicion or belief” that he helped facilitate the insurrection and is thus disqualified. “Challengers have reasonable suspicion that Representative Cawthorn was involved in efforts to intimidate Congress and the Vice-President into rejecting valid electoral votes and subvert the essential constitutional function of an orderly and peaceful transition of power,” the complaint read. The complaint went on to detail the ways Cawthorn allegedly promoted the demonstration ahead of time, including him tweeting: “The future of this republic hinges on the actions of a solitary few … It’s time to fight.” The complaint also details reports of Cawthorn meeting with planners of the 6 January demonstration and possibly the Capitol assault. Cawthorn, 26, became the youngest member of Congress after his November 2020 election, and has become a social media favorite of Trump supporters. He plans to run in a new district that appears friendlier to Republicans. He formally filed candidacy papers just before filing was suspended while redistricting lawsuits are pending. Last September, Cawthorn warned North Carolinians of potential “bloodshed” over future elections he claims could “continue to be stolen”, and questioned whether Biden was “dutifully elected”. He advised them to begin amassing ammunition for what he said is likely American-v-American “bloodshed” over unfavorable election results. “When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes your duty,” he said, in addition to describing the rioters who were arrested during the January 6 insurrection as “political prisoners”. He said “we are actively working” on plans for a similar protest in Washington. Ron Fein, legal director of Free Speech for People, a national election and campaign finance reform group backing the challenge to Cawthorn, told the Guardian the complaint was “the first legal challenge to a candidate’s eligibility under the disqualification clause filed since post civil war reconstruction in the 19th century.” He said: “It sets a line that says that just as the framers of the 14th amendment wrote and intended, you can’t take an oath to support the constitution and then facilitate an insurrection against the United States while expecting to pursue public office.” Fein said the challenge will be the first of many against members of Congress associated with the insurrection. Free Speech for People and the group Our Revolution announced last week they would urge state administrators to bar Trump and members of Congress from future ballots. He said: “This isn’t just about the voters of that district. The insurrection threatened our country’s entire democratic system and putting insurrectionists from any state into the halls of Congress threatens the entire country.” The challenge asks the board to create a five-member panel from counties within the proposed 13th district to hear the challenge. The panel’s decision can be appealed to the state board and later to court. The challengers also asked the board to let them question Cawthorn under oath in a deposition before the regional panel convenes, and to subpoena him and others to obtain documents. John Wallace, a longtime lawyer for Democratic causes in North Carolina, who also filed the challenge, told the Guardian: “The disqualification of Representative Cawthorn certainly should provide a deterrent to others who might try and obstruct or defeat our democratic processes.” Cawthorn spokesperson Luke Ball said “over 245,000 patriots from western North Carolina elected Congressman Cawthorn to serve them in Washington” – a reference to his November 2020 victory in the current 11th district. Now “a dozen activists who are comically misinterpreting and twisting the 14th amendment for political gain will not distract him from that service,” Ball wrote.",News/US news,Voters move to block Trump ally Madison Cawthorn from re-election,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/11/madison-cawthorn-trump-republican-north-carolina-voters
1/11/2022,"A coalition of influential political activists in Georgia that boosted turnout in a state that was crucial to Joe Biden’s victory in 2020 is now collectively refusing to attend the visit planned on Tuesday by the US president and Kamala Harris to speak on voting rights. The group had previously warned the president and vice president that they needed to announce a specific plan to get national voting rights legislation passed or risk their high-profile trip to Atlanta being dismissed as “a waste of time”.  On Monday evening, the coalition of activist groups – Black Voters Matter, Galeo Impact Fund, New Georgia Project Action Fund, Asian American Advocacy Fund, Atlanta-North Georgia Labor Council – along with James Woodall, the Georgia NAACP president, announced that “we will not be attending” when Biden and Harris give addresses on Tuesday afternoon. “Instead of giving a speech tomorrow, the US Senate should be voting tomorrow. What we need now, rather than a visit from the president, vice-president and legislators is for the White House and Senate to remain in DC and act immediately to pass federal legislation to protect our freedom to vote,” the groups said in joint statement. Instead of giving a speech tomorrow, the U.S. Senateshould be voting. What we need now, rather than a visit from @POTUS, @VP, and legislators, is for the @WhiteHouse and Senate to remain in DC and act immediately to pass federal legislation to protect our freedom to vote. Biden and Harris have planned a joint visit to Atlanta to advocate for flagship bills, currently stalled in the US Senate, to protect voting rights, which are increasingly under threat across the country, including in Georgia. But many Georgia activists and organizers have spoken out to make it clear they don’t support the leadership using the state and its civil rights legacy as “a photo-op” without a meaningful plan of legislative action. “If this is just a rhetorical exercise, just an attempt to perform advocacy, then I think it might be a waste of time,” Nse Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project voting rights advocacy, told the Guardian prior to the news that the coalition of groups will stay away. She said it was the work of local organizers that helped deliver the Democrats’ White House and Senate victories, and she’s pushing for the elimination of the filibuster rule that requires 60 senators to bring laws to a vote, while the Democrats only have 50 seats and Republicans won’t support the voting rights legislation. “There needs to be a federal standard for elections or the 2022 midterms are going to be chaotic,” Ufot said. Last Thursday the coalition of activists released a scorching letter warning the leaders not to travel without a “finalized plan” for new laws. It noted that Georgia voters “made history” to flip the state blue in November 2020, the first time it put a Democrat in the White House since 1992, with a huge turnout from Black voters in particular, then also elected Georgia Democrats Raphael Warnock and John Ossoff to give the party the edge in the US Senate. The letter said of those Georgia voters: “In return, a visit has been forced on them, requiring them to accept political platitudes and repetitious, bland promises. Such an empty gesture, without concrete action, without signs of real, tangible work, is unacceptable. Don’t come to Atlanta without a plan to pass voting laws! - @BlackVotersMtr @ngpaction @AsianAAF @GALEOImpactFund#GaPol #Georgiahttps://t.co/VsJcHyDmzH “As civil rights leaders and advocates, we reject any visit by President Biden that does not include an announcement of a finalized voting rights plan that will pass both chambers, not be stopped by the filibuster, and be signed into law.” The bills blocked by Senate Republicans using the filibuster are the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. The latter would create a “baseline national standard for voting access”, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The former, named after the late Georgia congressman and civil rights activist, would restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibiting states with a history of voter suppression from making changes to voting laws without federal approval, a key provision removed by a 2013 supreme court decision. Georgia passed a new voter restriction law in spring 2021 dubbed “Jim Crow in the 21st century” by Biden. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer hopes to change the filibuster rules if necessary to pass national voting rights legislation. But he faces opposition from centrist Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who also stand in the way of Biden’s Build Back Better bill. Cliff Albright, executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, said that potential speeches on Tuesday without a specific plan of action could send the message that the administration believes it’s possible to continue to “out-organize voter suppression”. “That’s just a bad strategy,” Albright said. “It’s not that we don’t want the president talking about these issues, but we don’t want it to just be a photo-op.” James Woodall, the Georgia NAACP president, said activists understand the challenges but it’s time for the White House to figure out how to make change. “We understand civics. We get it. They’re not senators and there are processes in place, like the filibuster, that require reform. But, that’s not our job,” Woodall said. “Our job was to get Ossoff and Warnock elected and to ensure that Donald Trump was not the president… Biden won and it was all because of what we did here in Georgia. Now, we’re asking them to do their part, which is to protect democracy.” Atlanta’s Bishop Reginald Jackson of the AME church, who pushed Georgia-based Coca Cola and Delta Air Lines to criticize voter suppression, said he “strongly supports” the visit. “They’ll be coming at a time when our democracy and its future is at great risk,” he said. But Ufot warned that if election integrity isn’t protected in time for midterm elections: “We’re talking about losing a generation of voters who think this is a Banana republic and their vote doesn’t matter.”",News/US news, Georgia activists warn Biden against a ‘photo-op’ visit that lacks voting rights plan,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/11/georgia-biden-harris-visit-voting-rights-bill
1/11/2022,"Good morning from me, Warren Murray, and welcome to your daily scene-setter.  Boris Johnson has been accused of an “utterly outrageous” breach of lockdown rules after a leaked email showed one of his top officials invited more than 100 Downing Street staff to a “bring your own booze” party. The police are investigating. The PM is believed to have attended the No 10 garden party on 20 May 2020 along with his then fiancee Carrie. At the time, social mixing was banned except with one other person from another household outdoors in a public place. An email by Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, seen by ITV News, encouraged staff to “make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening”. Johnson will now come under huge pressure to explain how he was involved. A spokesperson declined to comment in light of a continuing inquiry into potential breaches of lockdown in Downing Street. No 10 did not deny this weekend that Johnson and his wife, Carrie, whom he married in May 2021, attended the event. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “Boris Johnson has consistently shown that he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us … At the time this party took place, key workers on the frontline were working round the clock to keep us all safe, people suffered loneliness and loss in unimaginably tough circumstances.” With Conservative MPs again furious, Ian Blackford, the SNP Westminster leader, said Johnson “has no moral authority left, and as he won’t go – his Tory MPs have a duty to remove him from power.” Push for five-day isolation – Boris Johnson has ordered officials to examine plans to cut Covid isolation to five days in England. Scientists have urged caution – Prof Peter Openshaw, from the government’s virus advisory group Nervtag, said it was a “reasonable” idea but he had not seen evidence to back such a change. Meanwhile experts have told our science correspondent Linda Geddes that we can’t rely on the popular notion that it’s in Covid-19’s own interests to become more mild over time. Once a virus has spread via a person, it no longer needs that person, and doesn’t care whether they get sick or die afterwards. Even as more and more people gain immunity, Sars-Cov-2 could still evolve again, worsening the situation. The good news is this becomes less likely the more of the world’s population is vaccinated – the fewer infected, the fewer chances for the virus to evolve. Djokovic visa still on the line – The Australian Border Force is investigating whether Novak Djokovic incorrectly declared, in a form completed by an agent on his behalf, he had not travelled and would not do so for two weeks before his flight to Australia, in the latest twist in the tennis star’s visa cancellation saga. Social media posts seemingly show he was in Belgrade on Christmas Day before flying to Australia from Spain on 4 January. Despite winning back his visa in court, Djokovic’s fate may be determined by Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, who has the power to cancel it again. That would likely be met with a fresh legal challenge from Djokovic, who is trying to remain in Melbourne long enough to play in the Australian Open where he is chasing a male record 21st grand slam singles title. Lords watchdog receives Mone complaint – The House of Lords commissioners for standards are considering a complaint against the Conservative peer Michelle Mone, relating to the PPE business awarded £203m government contracts after she referred it to the Cabinet Office in May 2020. It comes after the Guardian reported that leaked files appear to suggest Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man-based financier Douglas Barrowman, were secretly involved in the company, PPE Medpro. After the company was awarded contracts in May and June 2020, Mone and Barrowman have consistently denied any “role or function” in PPE Medpro. Lawyers for Mone, who ran the lingerie company Ultimo before David Cameron made her a peer in 2015, have said she “was not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity”. Mone’s representatives declined to comment on the complaint. Mone’s lawyers have said the Guardian’s reporting is “grounded entirely on supposition and speculation and not based on accuracy”. Star jumps and porridge – Britain’s third-biggest energy supplier has apologised and said it was “embarrassed” after it advised customers to keep their heatings bills low by “having a cuddle with your pets”, eating “hearty bowls of porridge” and “doing a few star jumps”. MPs called the guidance from SSE Energy Services, part of Ovo, “insulting” and “offensive”. Millions of UK households are facing a “cost of living catastrophe” in the spring, including a rise in energy bills to as much as £2,000 a year on 1 April for an average household on a direct debit tariff. Labour will hope to pile pressure on Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson today with a binding vote in parliament on cutting VAT on home energy bills. Sunak, the chancellor, will attempt to quell Tory unrest over the cost of living as delegations of MPs press him to cancel a planned tax rise and ditch the VAT on energy bills in exchange for savings on tackling the pandemic. Dying man gets pig heart – Doctors in the US have transplanted a genetically modified pig’s heart into a patient who did not qualify for a human donor heart. David Bennett, 57, was on Monday breathing on his own while still connected to a heart-lung machine to help his new heart. Surgeons used a heart from a pig that had undergone gene-editing to lessen the chance of organ rejection. “It was either die or do this transplant. I want to live. I know it’s a shot in the dark, but it’s my last choice,” Bennett said a day before the surgery at the University of Maryland medical centre in Baltimore. Roman ruins on HS2 route – A wealthy Roman trading town has been discovered half a metre below the surface of a remote field in Northamptonshire. A 10-metre-wide Roman road, domestic and industrial buildings, more than 300 coins and at least four wells have been unearthed at the site, where 80 archaeologists have been working for the past 12 months. The field is on the route of the HS2 rail network and one of the associated archaeological effort’s most significant findings to date. It is known as Blackgrounds after the dense black soil that has helped preserve the Roman remains, and was used for pasture until the archaeological dig began. An iron age village, formed of more than 30 roundhouses, stood on the site at the time of the Roman invasion in 43BC. It expanded during the period of the Roman occupation which lasted until AD410. The US jail in Cuba has been beset by allegations of torture since it was set up 20 years ago. But despite all the promises to close it down, it remains operational with no end in sight, says Julian Borger.

Steven Gerrard refused to blame a lengthy VAR call that led to an Aston Villa equaliser being ruled out for offside for his team’s elimination from the FA Cup by Manchester United last night, with the manager instead urging his team to “flip” the result when hosting them in the Premier League on Saturday. Villa lost the third-round tie at Old Trafford 1-0 having conceded Scott McTominay’s early header but then dominated throughout. United also rode their luck as Villa had two goals ruled out in the second half. Sam Billings, fresh from the Big Bash League, has answered a call-up to England’s Ashes squad for Friday’s fifth Test in Hobart, 90 minutes before his intended flight for the T20 team’s upcoming Caribbean tour. Fresh doubt has been cast on European fixtures involving English rugby clubs playing in France this week amid fears strict travel rules could wreak more havoc on the Champions and Challenge Cups. Newcastle are due to play in France on Friday, as are Bath and Sale at the weekend, and while the organisers, European Professional Club Rugby, said last week that all fixtures will go ahead as planned, the key stumbling block is that clubs must isolate for 48 hours upon arrival before their matches, according to current travel rules. Stocks across Asia have carried on the downward trajectory set by Europe and Wall Street yesterday as concerns about rate increases by the US Federal Reserve weighed on the minds of investors. The FTSE100 looks like opening up around 0.3%, however, with the pound on $1.359 and €1.198. A full roundup of today’s front pages can be found here – our usual summary follows. The normally pro-Boris Johnson Express blasts a full-throated warning in its splash headline: “Enough Boris! You MUST end ‘partygate’ farce now”. The Mail takes a similar line and says “Boris rocked by new party revelations”. Others are more scathing with the i picking up on a particularly galling line from the leaked email invitation to the gathering on 20 May. “‘Bring your own booze’”. Our Guardian front page uses the same line: “Fury as email reveals No 10 ‘bring your own booze’ lockdown party”. The Mirror describes the email as “Invite to do what you like”, while the Metro goes with a play on words – “Downing it Street” – alongside a picture of Johnson quaffing a pint of beer. The coverage contrasts with that of the Times and Telegraph, neither of which choose to lead with the party revelations. The Times does have the story on its front page – “No10 celebrated ‘lovely weather’ with lockdown drinks party” – but leads on limits to sporting fixtures being eased. Ditto the Telegraph, which says “Johnson received invite to lockdown party” but leads on cabinet anger over misleading isolation guidance.
