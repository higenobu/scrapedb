4/1/2022,"A “callous” Florida man was dealt a life sentence last week by a circuit judge for intentionally running over a 75-year-old pedestrian, whom he left to die in the street. Justyn Pennell, 24, will spend the rest of his life behind bars without the possibility of parole for mowing down 75-year-old grandfather and Vietnam War veteran Michael Pratt with a Chrysler hatchback in January 2020. He’d pleaded no contest to the first-degree premeditated homicide, according to court documents obtained by Oxygen.com. Pennell, who appeared in an orange corrections jumpsuit, hung his head as Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Mary Handsel delivered the ruling on March 23, according to a Court TV video. “This is a tragedy that is felt by both families today,” Handsel told Pennell prior to sentencing him. “What you did was a lifetime sentence to yourself, to your mother, to your sister, and to the Pratt family…You chose the option that you chose even though you had other options.” Pennell was behind the wheel of a PT Cruiser on Jan. 9, 2020, running errands, when he spotted Pratt walking on Aripeka Road near Old Dixie Highway in Aripeka, Florida, according to the Tampa Bay Times. He ultimately turned the car around and accelerated at the 75-year-old, striking him, prosecutors said. Pratt, who unsuccessfully tried to jump out of the vehicle’s path, was pronounced dead at the scene. Pennell dialed 911 after his car broke down about a quarter mile from the scene of the deadly collision and confessed to dispatchers and responding deputies. Under questioning, Pennell told detectives he smiled and laughed when he saw Pratt’s face prior to fatally hitting him with the compact sport utility vehicle. During a January 2020 press conference, Pasco Sheriff Chris Nocco described him as “pure evil.” Prosecutors for the Sixth Judicial Circuit previously indicated they wouldn’t have sought the death penalty against Pennell had the case gone to trial. During his sentencing, the judge also thanked the 24-year-old for sparing Pratt’s family a lengthy trial. “The only thing I do want to do is thank you for saving the families, both yours and the victim’s family, from this trial,” Handsel said. “We who sit in this courtroom every day know hard it is on the families, on the jurors, that have to hear these types of cases and have to make these decisions. This case would have been one of the most difficult cases for these families to have heard.” The judge specifically pointed to transcripts of Pennell’s 911 call and interviews investigators conducted. “I can only imagine what it would have been if we heard it live, your voice saying these words that were, as the doctor put, callous without remorse,” Handsel said. ""It would have caused such emotional distress to the families in this matter. I think Mr. Pratt’s daughter said she was dreading hearing it and I can imagine it could have been worse if she would have had to do that. For that, I thank you.” The judge also ordered Pennell to pay several thousand dollars in various restitution fees and advised him he had 30 days to file for an appeal. A pair of bailiffs later escorted the shackled Florida man out of the courtroom. Pennell was released from a county detention facility on Thursday and was transferred into the custody of Florida Department of Corrections, according to online jail records obtained by Oxygen.com.

4/1/2022,"Jose Castillo, a current Walt Disney Company employee who is running for Congress in Florida as a Republican, told Fox News Digital that Disney's new political activism may come back to bite the company… in its pocketbook. Florida legislators have floated the idea of repealing the 1967 Reedy Creek Improvement Act, which gives Disney the autonomy to effectively run its own government in the area around Disney World, in response to the company's recent advocacy against the parental rights law H.B. 1557, which critics have branded the ""Don't Say Gay"" law. Repealing the law would subject Disney World to the government of Orange County. DESANTIS BROACHES REPEAL OF DISNEY WORLD'S SPECIAL SELF-GOVERNING STATUS IN FLORIDA Castillo warned that, if Disney's advocacy against the law spurs this repeal, it will hurt the company's bottom-line, especially if the company continues left-wing advocacy. ""I think that if Disney is going to continue this leftward lurch, and the legislature votes to give Disney the left-leaning policies that they’ve asked for, then they’ll be subject to the tyrannical rule of the mayor of Orange County, which they will soon regret,"" Castillo told Fox News Digital. ""If Disney falls under Orange County regulations and taxes, I suspect they’ll think twice before pushing for more of them."" Castillo declined to comment on whether he supports the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, but he did say that as a ""free market capitalist,"" he opposes ""the government giving special advantages to certain companies and individuals. It’s not the government’s job to pick winners and losers."" ""It is also probably in part because of these privileges and the considerable sway that Disney has in Florida that creates the impetus for them to weigh in on issues such as the Parental Rights in Education Bill,"" he added. ""It bothers me when I read public statements saying things like ‘we’ believe the bill shouldn’t have been passed,"" the employee added. ""I’ve been with Disney for 13 years and am proud of my role in the company. When the company uses words like ‘we’ it should mean all of the Cast Members, and right now, that’s not the case."" ‘SILENT MAJORITY’ OF DISNEY EMPLOYEES SUPPORT FLORIDA LAW, DISNEY EMPLOYEE RUNNING FOR CONGRESS SAYS Castillo previously told Fox News Digital that a ""silent majority"" of Disney employees support the law, even the the company has taken a public stance against it after LGBTQ employees protested. Despite critics branding it a ""Don't Say Gay"" bill, H.B. 1557 does not ban the word ""gay"" in school settings. Neither does it ban casual discussions of topics relating to sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. It does not require schools to notify parents if their child identifies as gay or transgender. ""Conservative Disney cast members are afraid to speak out because of the company’s very public stance opposing the Parental Rights in Education bill,"" he said. ""I think that’s a grave miscalculation on Disney’s part because the vocal minority doesn’t speak for the majority of cast members or the majority of Florida parents who don’t want their young children to be taught about sexuality by public school teachers."" Castillo told Fox News Digital that he believes in the mission of the Walt Disney Company, ""but I believe the current trajectory of the company- vowing to repeal this law- is missing the essence and the principles upon which Disney was founded.""",U.S./Fox News,Disney employee issues dire warning about the economic consequences of new 'leftward lurch',https://news.yahoo.com/disney-employee-issues-dire-warning-073649571.html
