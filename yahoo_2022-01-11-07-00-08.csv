 The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol accused Rep. Jim Jordan of backtracking on his commitment to cooperate after the Ohio Republican said Sunday he would refuse to voluntarily appear before the panel. ""Mr. Jordan has previously said that he would cooperate with the committee's investigation, but it now appears that the Trump team has persuaded him to try to hide the facts and circumstances of January 6th. The Select Committee will respond to this letter in more detail in the coming days and will consider appropriate next steps,"" a committee spokesperson said Monday. Jordan previously said he has ""nothing to hide"" with regard to his actions surrounding Jan. 6. In a four-page letter sent to the committee Sunday night, Jordan said he has ""no relevant information"" that would assist the committee's investigation. ""At the time of the security breach of the Capitol, I was present in the House Chamber performing my official duties pursuant to the U.S. Constitution and federal law. The other topics referenced in your letter likewise related to the performance of official duties. Your attempt to pry into the deliberative process of informing a member about legislative matters before the House is an outrageous abuse of the select committee's authority,"" Jordan wrote in the letter shared on Twitter. ""This unprecedented action serves no legitimate legislative purpose and would set a dangerous precedent for future Congresses,"" he added. The panel requested Jordan's assistance in a Dec. 22 letter largely geared toward learning more about the lawmaker's communications with former President Trump. Jordan has acknowledged he spoke with Trump that day. The committee's Monday statement goes further, alleging that Jordan had knowledge of Trump's plans for contesting the election and that the former president's legal team may be pressuring the Ohio lawmaker not to cooperate. ""Mr. Jordan's letter fails to address the principal bases for the Select Committee's request for a meeting, including that he worked directly with President Trump and the Trump legal team to attempt to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Jordan has admitted that he spoke directly to President Trump on January 6th and is thus a material witness. Mr. Jordan's letter to the committee fails to address these facts,"" the committee continued in its statement. Beyond his communications with the president, other texts from Jordan have also surfaced during the committee investigation. Texts from Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows show Jordan forwarded him a text message calling for former Vice President Mike Pence to buck his ceremonial duty to certify election results. And another text from Meadows's trove shows that Fox News host Sean Hannity also communicated with Jordan, apparently raising new possible options ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration. Jordan is one of three people from whom the committee has sought voluntary cooperation. Similar letters have been sent to Hannity and Rep.

Hannah Cardenas sent her footage to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). The FWC, explaining that mink sightings are rare because of the animals’ elusive nature, shared the footage via Facebook on Monday, stating: “Imagine the surprise seeing this Everglades mink scampering across the road carrying DINNER! A mother and daughter were on their way home from a nature hike in Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park when they spotted this mink run across the road in front of them – seconds later, it ran BACK across the road with a GIANT SNAKE in its mouth!” Mink occasionally prey on snakes longer than their body lengths. They also eat fish, birds, and small mammals. RECENTLY ON FTW OUTDOORS: Crappie anglers busted with 152 fish over the limit According to the FWC website, mink are difficult to study in terms of abundance and distribution “because this species is small sized, fast moving, and excellent at remaining out of sight.

1/11/2022,"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Monday he plans to remove Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) from their respective committees if Republicans retake the House majority. Why it matters: McCarthy's comments offer a preview of the scorched-earth tactics Republicans may adopt if they win back control of Congress in 2022. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. McCarthy has long said the removal of Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) from their committees sets a new standard that his party will not hesitate to use against Democrats. In a floor speech opposing the Gosar's ouster in November, McCarthy said certain members, including Schiff, Swalwell and Omar, will ""need the approval of a majority"" to remain on their panels. Republicans also point to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's refusal to seat two of McCarthy's picks for the Jan. 6 select committee as another precedent-setter. What they're saying: ""He will not be serving there,"" McCarthy said of Swalwell's placement on the House Intelligence Committee in an interview with Breitbart. ""Ilhan Omar should not be serving on"" the House Foreign Affairs Committee, McCarthy added. ""Adam Schiff, he should not be serving on Intel."" McCarthy pointed to Swalwell's association with a Chinese spy, reported by Axios. Swalwell, who cut ties with the spy after being alerted to her activities by federal investigators, has not been accused of wrongdoing. In the case of Omar, McCarthy quoted her 2019 remark that a pro-Israel lobbying group's influence in Congress is ""all about the Benjamins,"" which was blasted by members of both parties at the time as anti-Semitic. McCarthy also said Schiff ""lied to the American public"" with his support of the unverified Steele Dossier, which alleged extensive ties between former President Trump and Russia. The other side: “It is always difficult to take Kevin McCarthy seriously,"" Schiff spokesperson Lauren French told Axios. ""Nevertheless, allowing McCarthy to get anywhere near the Speaker’s gavel would be catastrophic — not just because of his propensity for falsehoods and smears, but because he will exist solely to do Donald Trump’s bidding — even potentially overturning the 2024 results.” Swalwell's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but he responded to McCarthy on Twitter: ""McCarthy is targeting me for 1 reason: I’m effective. He wants to carry water (& sort Starbursts) for Trump’s Big Lie & not be called out. He’s projecting onto me b/c he’s incapable of facing down the Ku Klux Klan elements in his caucus.

1/11/2022,"A former Tulsa police officer was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted of killing his daughter’s boyfriend in 2014. Despite being convicted of second-degree murder, the ex-cop maintains that he is innocent and acted in self-defense. The Associated Press reports that on Friday, Jan. 8, an Oklahoma federal judge sentenced Shannon Kepler, 61, to 300 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. He was sentenced for using a firearm in the commission of second-degree murder. In April of 2021, a federal jury convicted Kepler in Jeremy Lake’s slaying. U.S. District Judge Gregory Frizzell further ordered the father to pay restitution to pay for a headstone for Lake, the 19-year old he shot and killed. The 24-year police veteran said he shot Lake because he felt threatened, believing the teenager had a firearm. He has claimed for eight years his actions were in self-defense. However, police were unable to locate a weapon on Lake’s person or around the scene of the crime. Witnesses also testified that they did not see the young Black man with a gun either. Kepler would also claim that his daughter had run away from their home on the Muscogee Nation, one of the state’s historic Native American reservations and that he was nervous for her because she was at the time living in a bad neighborhood. Still, the court of law found him guilty, believing that he should serve time for killing the young man. In a statement released on the DOJ’s website, U.S. Attorney Clint Johnson stated, “Nineteen-year-old Jeremey Lake died almost immediately after Shannon Kepler gunned him down in the street in 2014.” “Kepler, at the time, was sworn to uphold the law but instead made a series of decisions that led to the young man’s murder,” he continued. “Today’s 25-year sentence provides a measure of justice to Mr. Lake’s family, though I know their healing continues.” The statement provided by Johnson’s office detailed the circumstances around the murder, which differ from Kepler’s original assertion. The courts found that Kepler took his 18-year-old daughter to a homeless shelter a week before the shooting, and left her there after taking away her cellphone and leaving her with no change of clothes or money. He then logged into her Facebook, where he noticed that she changed her status to “in a relationship” with Lake. He used his access to police databases to research the boy’s criminal records. He planned, days after tapping into her social media, to confront Lake at the address he secured from the police database. He put on dark clothes and got into his wife’s dark car to go to where Lake was staying, securing a loaded revolver in the waistband of his pants. He waited for him, however, after seeing his daughter approaching with the young man, he shot twice hitting Lake both times in the chest. He then turned and shot in the direction of his daughter, Lake’s brother, and a third person. Judge Frizzell dismissed one of the assault charges against Kepler related to this particular incident. The bench noted that the statute of limitations for this crime had expired and thus, he would not be accountable for the violence perpetrated against Lake’s brother. During the sentencing, Lake’s father was afforded an opportunity to speak about his first-born son, sharing the toll that the process of securing justice has impacted his life emotionally and physically. According to KJRH 2 News, the first three trials ended in mistrials. In his fourth trial, Kepler was convicted in 2017 in a state trial of manslaughter. The jury recommended 15 years in prison for the crime. He appealed this ruling on the grounds that since the shooting happened on the Muscogee Nation’s Reservation, and he is a citizen of the tribe, Oklahoma prosecutors lack the authority to try him. In November of 2020, he was charged with first-degree murder in a federal court and The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals overturned the 2017 manslaughter conviction in March. Lake’s death was days before that of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old Black boy gunned down on a street in Ferguson, Missouri. Both teenagers were killed by officers, and are said to have contributed to the launch of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014.

As the lunar rover made a closer approach, a log of its activities revealed the object was actually just a rock on a crater rim. The revelation came as the lunar rover drove closer to the formation that was once believed to be as tall as Paris' Arc de Triomphe, according to a post published Friday on ""Our Space,"" a Chinese media channel affiliated with the China National Space Administration. Instead, it was much smaller and had a peculiar shape. Upon a closer view, the rock looked like a ""jade rabbit"" holding carrots, the post said. ""The Moon's surface is 38 million square kilometres of rocks, so it would have been astronomically exceptional for it to be anything else,"" Space News journalist Andrew Jones wrote on Twitter.

China landed Yutu 2 as part of its unmanned Chang'e 4 mission. Yutu 2 first encountered the object while driving across the Von Kármán crater in November during the mission's 36th lunar day, according to Our Space. The rover, which was 80 meters away (about 262 feet), sent back images of the object on the horizon, sparking theories about what it could be on social media, with some joking it could be an alien base. While the results of the rock may have been underwhelming for some, it's all part of China's rapidly accelerating space program.

1/11/2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Backed by soaring revenues amid the pandemic, California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday proposed a budget that would pay for the health care of all the state's low-income residents living in the country illegally, while cutting taxes for businesses and halting a scheduled increase in the gas tax later this summer. California taxpayers already pay for the health care of young adults and people 50 and over living in the country illegally, provided they meet certain income requirements. Now, Newsom wants California to become the first state to cover all adults who are living in the country illegally, a move that would eventually cost $2.2 billion per year. “We're doing something that no other state has done,” Newsom said. Newsom said his $286.4 billion budget proposal tackles five of the state's biggest problems — what his administration called “existential threats” — including the surging coronavirus pandemic; wildfires and drought worsened by global warming; homelessness; income inequality including the lack of health insurance for some immigrants; and public safety, including combatting a recent flurry of coordinated smash-and-grab robberies. The “existential” label is usually applied to climate change and the pandemic, Newsom acknowledged, but he said homelessness, the rising cost of living and public safety are “understandably top of mind in terms of people’s concerns.” The governor said his budget includes a $45.7 billion surplus, which is larger than previous estimates because his administration uses a different definition of what counts as surplus. The proposed $2.2 billion program to aid immigrants in the country illegally would not take effect until January 2024 to include “all low-income Californians, regardless of immigration status,” Newsom said. The state has made great strides in reducing its uninsured population in recent years, but the largest single group left behind under the state's Medicaid program are low-income residents in the country illegally. The state began covering immigrants 26 and under in 2019, and those 50 and older last year. The governor's budget address kicks off months of haggling with his fellow Democrats who control the state Legislature, talks that will intensify when Newsom presents an updated spending proposal in May. Some progressive legislative Democrats last week proposed creating in California the nation’s first universal health care system, backed by steep tax hikes that would have to be approved by voters. But Newsom touted his own more incremental approach. Among steps to ease the state's rising costs, he proposed pausing a scheduled increase to the state's gas tax on July 1. It was one of 10 tax incentives he touted. He also proposed $45 million to promote tourism; $40 million to waive filing fees for new businesses; and $26 million to provide technical assistance to new businesses Newsom also has pledged to spend $300 million on boosting law enforcement efforts to combat retail theft and another $2.7 billion to spend on things like coronavirus testing and hospital staffing. He additionally on Monday proposed spending $648 million to back wildland firefighters and buy more helicopters and bulldozers, plus another $1.2 billion on top of the current budget year's $1.5 billion for forest management. Another $750 million would go to drought relief, on top of the current budget year's $5.2 billion water package. Also on the environmental front, he pledged to keep reducing California’s reliance on fossil fuels. “On the surface, there are certainly things to like in this proposal; funding for clean water, wildfire prevention and homelessness are all worthy goals,"" Assembly Republican Leader Marie Waldron said in a statement. “But look at the details and you’ll see that much of this spending isn’t going to transformative projects to improve the lives of Californians, but rather to clean up from years of Democratic mismanagement."" Sen. Jim Nielsen, ranking Republican on the Senate's budget committee, said the state should devote its budget surplus to building reservoirs, increasing forest management to alleviate wildfires and supporting law enforcement. To confront the state's seemingly intractable homelessness problem, Newsom proposed spending $2 billion for mental health services, housing, and clearing homeless encampments. That's on top of last year's $12 billion package. The combination would create a projected 55,000 new housing units and treatment slots. To help with the ever-growing cost of living in California, Newsom proposed “doubling down” on the state's existing plan to provide free universal pre-kindergarten; adding thousands of child care slots and boosting before-, after- and summer school programs. He also proposed continued aid to small businesses hit hard by the pandemic by waiving fees and providing hundreds of millions in grants and tax breaks. Newsom's massive projected budget and surplus brings the state a long way from the gloom of 2020, when Newsom and state lawmakers cut spending, raised taxes and pulled money from the state's savings accounts to cover what they feared would be a pandemic-fueled $54 billion deficit. That deficit never happened. Instead, state revenues soared like never before. In September, collections from the state's three largest taxes — personal income, sales and corporation — were 40% higher than September 2020 and nearly 60% higher than September 2019, before the pandemic hit, according to the Legislative Analyst's Office. ___ Associated Press reporter Don Thompson contributed.",Politics/Associated Press,California's Newsom wants health coverage for all immigrants,https://news.yahoo.com/californias-newsom-wants-health-coverage-050112809.html

As you celebrated the holidays with your family in 2021, know that my family suffered through the first Christmas in 24 years without my dear, sweet, son, Jacob. He’s dead because your department was called to help him and instead, your officers spent hours shouting commands at a confused, homeless, schizophrenic man, and then shot and killed him because he failed to comply. There was no crime in progress. He was a threat to no one but himself when your officers appeared on the scene. Your ineffective, antiquated department policies and the fumbling, bumbling trained killers deployed at the scene, apparently had no choice when faced with one homeless man, but to gun him down? An officer fired a high powered rifle bullet through his young body, piercing his heart and lungs, destroying him, killing him. Jacob should be alive and receiving treatment. Instead, I am forced to be on this planet for decades without my first born child, my beloved son, because I asked for your help.
