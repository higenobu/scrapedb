5/9/2022,"This weekend, Bitcoin (BTC) fell back to sub-$35,000 for the first time since February. There was no weekend relief rally in the wake of Thursday’s sell-off, with the broader crypto market also on the slide. Bitcoin’s technical indicators continue to flash red, with Bitcoin sitting well below the 50-day EMA. On Saturday, bitcoin (BTC) fell for a third consecutive day, with the crypto market finding little support following Thursday’s Fed-driven sell-off. Investor sentiment towards inflation and Fed monetary policy continued to hit riskier assets going into the weekend. With no direction coming from the US markets until Monday, the bears remain in control. On Saturday, BTC fell by 1.50%. Following a 1.47% decline on Friday, BTC ended the day at $35,469. Thursday through to Saturday, the crypto total market cap fell by $180 billion to $1,608 billion. This morning, the Fear & Greed Index slid from 23/100 to 18/100. The decline saw the Index fall deeper into the “Extreme Fear” zone. Last month, the Index hit a month high of 53/100 on April 05, which coincided with Bitcoin revisiting $47,000 levels before hitting reverse. The “Extreme Fear” zone reflects investor expectations of further price deterioration and is aligned with the technical indicators. At the time of writing, bitcoin was down by 2.27% to $34,666. A bearish start to the day saw BTC slide through the First Major Support Level at $34,828. Bitcoin will need to move through the First Major Support Level at $34,828 and the day’s $35,478 pivot to target the First Major Resistance Level at $36,119. Bitcoin would need broader market support to break out from $35,500. In the event of an extended rally, bitcoin could test the Second Major Resistance Level at $36,119. The Third Major Resistance Level sits at $38,062. Failure to move through First Major Support Level and the pivot would bring the Second Major Support Level at $34,186 into play. Barring another extended sell-off, bitcoin should avoid sub-$33,500. The Third Major Support Level sits at $32,895. Looking at the EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (below), it is a bearish signal. Bitcoin sits below the 50-day EMA, currently at $37,518. This morning, we saw the 50-day EMA pull back from the 100-day EMA, delivering downside pressure. The 100-day EMA also fell back from the 200-day EMA, BTC negative. A move through the 50-day EMA would support a look at $38,000.

5/9/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia cut oil prices for buyers in Asia as coronavirus lockdowns in China weigh on demand, countering uncertainty around Russia’s supplies as the Ukraine war drags on.

The state-controlled company dropped its key Arab Light crude grade for next month’s shipments to Asia to $4.40 a barrel above the benchmark it uses, from $9.35 in May. That’s in line with a Bloomberg survey of refiners and traders from late April that forecast a $5 decrease. Aramco also lowered all grades for the north west Europe region and almost all for the Mediterranean. Prices for U.S. customers were kept unchanged from May. Saudi Arabia raised its crude to record levels in the past two months after prices surged above $100 a barrel when Russia invaded Ukraine. Russian exports have already fallen and may drop further as the European Union moves closer to formally sanctioning energy supplies from the country. While the war has tightened the global oil market, Beijing’s Covid Zero strategy has lead to China’s largest demand shock since the early days of the pandemic. Consumption of gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel last month was expected to slide 20% from a year earlier, Bloomberg reported on April 22. China’s Strategy Chinese Premier Li Keqiang warned in a statement on Saturday of a “complicated and grave” employment situation as the government tries to contain Covid. China’s leaders doubled down on their strategy last week, warning against any attempts to question the approach even as economic activity contracts amid factory closings and supply-chain disruptions. Still, the world’s biggest independent oil trader said on Sunday that China’s measures were working as far as stopping the spread of the virus is concerned. “It’s obviously a terrible situation for citizens of Shanghai and entire parts of Beijing have been told to work from home,” Mike Muller, Vitol Group’s head of Asia, said Sunday on a podcast produced by Dubai-based Gulf Intelligence. “But it hasn’t spiraled or snowballed into something really, really dramatic. Therefore people have not worsened their demand-loss projections from China.” Aramco’s decision comes days after OPEC+, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, agreed to continue increasing crude output only gradually, adding 432,000 barrels a day to the market in June. The 23-nation group has struggled to meet even that modest target. Saudi Arabia sends more than 60% of its crude exports to Asia, with China, Japan, South Korea and India being the biggest buyers.

5/9/2022,"The interest rate on America’s most popular home loan moved back up this week, reaching its highest level in nearly 13 years, a widely followed survey shows. The historic surge in the 30-year mortgage rate — now two full percentage points higher than at the start of the year — is beginning to have a slight cooling effect on the market. Aspiring buyers are being priced out and competition is softening ever so slightly as the cost of borrowing for a home has spiked 55%, according to some estimates. Though some markets remain hotter and more cometitive than others. But the near constant rate hikes could moderate, according to Mortgage Bankers Association economist Mike Fratantoni, who said this week that they are likely to “plateau near current levels.” Get the latest personal finance news sent straight to your inbox with the MoneyWise newsletter. The average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage jumped this week to 5.27%, up from 5.1% a week ago, housing finance giant Freddie Mac reported Thursday. Last year at this time, the 30-year rate was 2.69%. The upward move comes amid a newsworthy week for the economy, which is experiencing the highest inflation it's seen in decades. To fight off sky-high consumer prices, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point, the largest rate increase since 2000, making all sorts of consumer loans more expensive. As fewer borrowers can afford to finance the purchase of a new house, record-high appreciation in the housing market is expected to slow. “While housing affordability and inflationary pressures pose challenges for potential buyers, house price growth will continue but is expected to decelerate in the coming months,” says Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. 3 simple ways to invest in real estate without the headaches of buying a house To win in this year’s hot US real estate market, buyers skip inspections and pay over asking Inflation adds to financial stress this year — but should it change how you invest? The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is now averaging 4.52% — also up from last week when it was 4.4%, Freddie Mac says. A year ago at this time, the 15-year rate averaged 2.3%. Higher rates across all types of mortgages have held back buyers as well as those seeking to refinance their loans. The increase in rates over just the past two months has triggered a 49% drop in refinance activity, says Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting. The five-year adjustable-rate mortgage also moved higher last week, averaging 3.96%. That’s compared with 3.78% a week ago. A year ago at this time, the 5-year ARM averaged 2.7%. With a 5/1 ARM, the interest rate is set for the first five years, then adjusts annually — sometimes going up sharply — over the remaining course of the loan. ARMs, however, have lower initial rates than longer loans. They can be attractive to some buyers who don’t plan to be in their homes for a long time. These loans typically adjust in tune with the prime rate. If rates were to fall after an initial period of an ARM, borrowers could potentially refinance into a lower rate at a longer term. But there’s also the risk that rates go higher. After several years of sub-4% mortgage rates, “a new reality has emerged” for buyers, says Joel Berner, senior economic analyst for Realtor.com, as list prices reach all-time highs and monthly financing costs soar. Yet there’s a silver lining to the shifting market. The number of homes for sale, which is still below pre-pandemic levels, is showing signs of improving, Berner says, citing a recent 3% increase in the number of new listings on Realtor.com compared with the same period last year. “As prospective buyers budget for a new mortgage and evaluate whether to continue their home search in light of affordability challenges, they might find that the competition is thinning out just as more home options come onto the market,” he says. Even so, buying a home is now 55% more expensive than it was a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors. “Mortgages now compared to just a few months ago are costing more money for home buyers,” Lawrence Yun, the group’s chief economist said during a nationwide meeting for real estate agents this week. “For a median-priced home, the price difference is $300 to $400 more per month, which is a hefty toll for a working family.” Get the latest personal finance news sent straight to your inbox with the MoneyWise newsletter.

5/9/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Commodity firms will find it much harder to buy and sell Russian oil from the middle of this month, according to the world’s biggest independent crude trader, as Europe tightens sanctions on Moscow for invading Ukraine. Most Read from Bloomberg Elon Musk’s Fixer Is Quietly Tending the World’s Biggest Fortune Abortion-Rights Protest Targets Homes of Kavanaugh, Roberts Russia Can’t Shake Default Risk After Last-Minute Bond Payment Heirs of Hitler’s Billionaires Need to Reckon With the Past China Premier Warns of ‘Grave’ Jobs Situation as Lockdowns Weigh Russia’s exports of crude and oil products have probably dropped by around 1 million barrels a day from 7.5 million before the attack in late February, Mike Muller, head of Asia at Vitol Group, said Sunday on a podcast produced by Dubai-based Gulf Intelligence. They could fall further after May 15, he said. Many trading houses interpret European Union regulations as prohibiting them from dealing with Russian state energy companies beyond then. “We’re virtually on top of that date where the international banking system just cannot make payments to Russian entities work,” Muller said. “EU sanctions prohibit a whole number of things from May 15.” There will be a “different reality” even for companies that have until now kept up Russian energy purchases because they have contractual obligations to fulfill, he said. Geneva-based Vitol, which traded 7.6 million barrels of crude and refined oil a day in 2021, said last month that it intends to stop dealing in Russian-origin products by the end of this year. Oil jumped to a multi-week high of around $110 a barrel last week as the EU moved closer to formally banning imports from Russia. The bloc intends to sanction Russian crude in six months and oil products by the end of the year to punish the Kremlin for the war. Some members, notably Hungary, are trying to prevent a ban, however. Many traders, shippers, insurers and banks are already shunning Russian energy for fear of breaching existing financial sanctions or to avoid reputational damage. Some smaller merchants will continue dealing with Russia beyond this month, said Muller. Still, there will be delays and bottlenecks as they struggle to find shippers and insurers willing to take on exposure to Russian barrels. “An entire segment of the shipping market will need to be dedicated to this trade,” Muller said. “There are many words for it, but it’s clearly not mainstream. The oil will trade at a discount and the ships will trade at a premium because the ship owner engaging in this business may find his ships aren’t accepted by anybody else for some time to come.” Few nations beyond the U.S. and Europe have imposed sanctions on Russia and many are keen to buy more of its oil, which is being sold with hefty discounts. India, one of the world’s biggest crude importers, has increased purchases from Russia since the invasion and is trying to get even bigger price deductions, Bloomberg reported last week. Germany has invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a Group of Seven leaders’ summit next month as a special guest, part of an effort to forge a broader international alliance against Moscow.
