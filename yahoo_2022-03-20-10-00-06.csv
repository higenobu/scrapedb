3/20/2022,"Former President Donald Trump returned to Broward County Saturday to speak to some of his most ardent supporters from the stage of FLA Live Arena at the American Freedom Tour, a private event where attendees paid up to $6,999 for seats and access to some of the Republican Party’s biggest names. Ahead of Trump, Pastor Mark Burns warmed up the crowd by falsely declaring that Trump won the 2020 election and leading a chant of “Trump won.” Conservative pundit Candace Owens, according to the private event’s Twitter feed, called COVID “a government virus.” Prior to the former president’s speech, his son, Donald Trump Jr., criticized the U.S. withdrawal of Afghanistan from the stage at FLA Live Arena. Thousands of supporters were pumped to see Trump. Here’s what they had to say “We left 86 billion dollars of equipment,” Trump Jr. said. “Our generals, and I quote, ‘could not see this coming’ … You know who could see it coming? Everybody!” READ MORE: The American Freedom Tour with Trump is under way in Broward. Here’s what’s happening now. Then the former president spoke. Following a video introduction of a monologue from the 1970 movie “Patton” played on a giant video screen — “When you put your hand into a bunch of goo, that a moment before was your best friend’s face ... you’ll know what to do” — the President launched into attacks on President Joe Biden and “the socialist left.” READ MORE: See photos of Trump supporters arriving at the American Freedom Tour event in Broward Here are some excerpts: “They pulled this together in about three days and the place is packed,” Trump said, pivoting to attacks on the press. “Everybody always remain in their seat. The fake news if they see one empty seat they’ll say ‘It wasn’t sold out.’ It sold out so fast. You know, we didn’t allow the fake news in today.” (The American Freedom Tour did not offer press credentials for the event, so the Miami Herald purchased a ticket. Proceeds, according to an event representative, paid for the cost of the event and for speaker fees. The American Freedom Tour continued to show tickets available on its website as Trump was speaking.) A question to event organizers about the head count and ticket sales was not immediately answered. The American Freedom Tour stage was set-up concert style, with one-third of the arena and the highest seating levels blocked off. Available seating was packed and nearly full, with sparse open seating left. Some attendees circled the stadium trying to find an open space. “I got a lot of great people elected in Florida. Your governor was elected. Ron came to me, along with 12 other people,” Trump said about his endorsement of DeSantis in the 2018 Republican primary race for Florida governor. “Ron was at 3% and he was not going to win, and he came to me and said, “If you endorse me I think I’m going to win.’ I said, ‘Ron, you got a long way to go.’” “The Secretary of Agriculture, he had 38[% support] and $22 million in cash. Ron was at [3%] with no cash. Other than that he was doing well. He was helpful so I endorsed him and they said it was like a, to use a terrible term, like a nuclear weapon went off. He ended up winning easy. He went from 3% to 71[%].’” “It was my personality that kept us out of war,” he said. “I was the only president in four decades who did not get America into any conflicts, except I totally defeated ISIS.” FOX News report from Tuesday: CENTCOM commander: ISIS attacks will ‘ramp up’ in summer as Taliban struggles to keep them at bay “Other nations should not mistake Joe Biden’s weakness for America’s weakness. American power, American might, American leadership will soon be back and it will be back bigger and stronger then ever before.” “We had a tremendous victory in Florida. Remember, they came in with hundreds of millions of dollars. They were going to beat us. We beat the hell out of them. We beat them big.” “We won twice. We did much better the second time, and we may have to do it again,” said Trump, continuing to promote the lie that he won the 2020 election and teasing a third run. Shortly after, he said: “With the support of everyone in this room, we will take back the House, we will take back the Senate and we will take back our country, and then most importantly in 2024 we are going to take back our beautiful White House.” “Joe Biden’s devastating assault, like nobody has ever seen before, on American energy production has left our citizens paying the highest gas prices in the history of our county.” “Despite the fact that America is the most energy-rich nation on the planet … Biden is now pathetically begging countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela to please bail out America when just one-and-a-half years ago we were getting rich and powerful off of our energy.” This article will be updated.",Politics/Miami Herald,Excerpts from Trump’s speech Saturday at the American Freedom Tour in Broward County,https://news.yahoo.com/excerpts-trump-speech-saturday-american-225757359.html

Boris Johnson: ‘Blindingly obvious’ now’s not the time for IndyRef2 David Cameron joins the Ukraine war effort by driving lorry to Poland Camilla Tominey: Nicola Sturgeon has turned Scotland into a banana republic Jacob Rees-Mogg: Ukraine war shows ‘partygate’ was ‘fluff’ Vladimir Putin is in a ""total panic"" about the prospect of a revolution in Moscow, Boris Johnson has said. ""He has been in a total panic about a so-called colour revolution in Moscow itself and that is why he is trying so brutally to snuff out the flame of freedom in Ukraine and that's why it is so vital that he fails,"" Mr Johnson said. ""A victorious Putin will not stop in Ukraine, and the end of freedom in Ukraine will mean the extinction of any hope of freedom in Georgia and then Moldova, it will mean the beginning of a new age of intimidation across eastern Europe from the Baltic to the Black Sea."" The Prime Minister also rejected normalising relations with Mr Putin, even after the end of his invasion of Ukraine. ""This is a turning point for the world. It's a choice between freedom and oppression,"" he told the Conservative spring party conference in Blackpool. ""To try to renormalise relations with Putin after this, as we did in 2014, would be to make exactly the same mistake again."" The Prime Minister has described Putin as a ""a backstreet pusher, feeding addiction, creating dependence"" on Russia's gas and oil, leading to the cost of living crisis. ""Putin's war is intended to cause economic damage to the west and to benefit him,"" Boris Johnson told the conference. ""He knows that with every dollar increase in the price of a barrel of oil, he gets billions more in revenues from the sales of either oil and gas, and that's the tragedy of the situation. ""Now he wants to weaken the collective will to resist by pushing up the cost of living, hitting us at the pumps and in our fuel bills, so we must respond."" He said the Government must continue to do ""everything they can"" to help people, and also make sure there is a ""strong economy and strong economic fundamentals with well-paid jobs"". Concluding his speech, the Prime Minister said: ""It’s the Conservatives who stand up for freedom and against the blackmail of Putin."" ""Because we know that it’s only by sticking up for freedom that we can deliver long term prosperity and security."" Douglas Ross has argued that Nicola Sturgeon's SNP has no ""positive ideas"" to help Scotland on any of the big issues facing its people, reports Simon Johnson. He says his party's aim must be to replace them in government at the next Holyrood election rather than being the main opposition party. He says: ""People concerned right now about the cost-of-living crisis, concerned right now about long waiting times in our NHS, concerned about the education we are giving to the next generation. ""And they all know that independence is not the answer to any of those problems. ""Not once did I hear anyone say that they wanted an independence referendum next year. Not once. ""They want a government that’s totally focused on the NHS, on jobs, on education, on their priorities. ""There are so many people who are looking for anyone who can step up and beat them, who can remove this SNP Government, who can kick Nicola Sturgeon out of Bute House. ""Because coming second place, being the largest opposition, is not enough. Boris Johnson has urged nations to end their dependency on Russian oil and gas as it allows Vladimir Putin to squeeze the Western cost of living. ""There is a cost to our sanctions. But the cost of doing nothing would be far, far higher,"" the PM said. ""Now Putin wants to weaken to weaken the collective will to resist by pushing up the cost of living. Hitting us at the pumps and in our fuel bills."" ""It is time to take back control of our energy supplies."" Boris Johnson has rejected normalising relations with Vladimir Putin, even after the end of his invasion of Ukraine. ""This is a turning point for the world. It's a choice between freedom and oppression,"" he said. ""To try to renormalise relations with Putin after this, as we did in 2014, would be to make exactly the same mistake again."" ""I know it is the instinct of the people of this country to choose freedom every time."" Boris Johnson said Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine because he fears free societies. ""We stand with the Ukrainian people and our hearts go out to them,"" the Prime Minister told the Ukrainian ambassador. ""It is clear Putin made a catastrophic mistake."" ""He didn't really believe the semi-mystical guff he wrote about the origins of the Russian people. I don't know if you read it. Nostradamus meets Russian Wikipedia,"" he quipped. ""He was frightened of Ukraine because in Ukraine they have free press. They have free elections. And with every year Ukraine progressed towards freedom and democracy and open markets, he feared the Ukrainian example and the implicit reproach to himself."" ""Because in Putin's Russia you get jailed for 15 years just for calling an invasion an invasion, and if you stand against Putin in an election you get poisoned or shot."" Mr Putin was in a ""total panic"" about the prospect of a revolution in Moscow, Mr Johnson added. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Putin's invasion of Ukraine has ""shattered our post-Cold War complacency"", reports our chief political correspondent Camilla Turner. She said we ""cannot and will not"" rest until we see Ukraine's sovereignty restored, and told delegates that she has heard some people in Ukraine ""sing God Save The Queen"" as they use British military equipment. Ms Truss said: ""When we’re facing a tyrant like Vladimir Putin, the only thing he understands is strength."" She went on to tell delegates: ""Now is the time to end the culture of self-doubt, the constant self-questioning and introspection - the ludicrous debates about languages, statues and pronouns. Our history, warts and all, is what makes us what we are today."" Liz Truss used her speech to reiterate the Conservative commitment to freedom. ""This crisis has shown the strength of the free world,"" she said. ""When people are free to choose, they choose freedom."" ""We live in a great country, a great democracy and we should be proud of it."" Concluding our speech, Ms Truss said: ""Putin must fail and with Britain at the front, we will ensure he does."" Addressing Vadym Prystaiko, Liz Truss said: ""Ambassador, everyone in Britain is saying Slava Ukraini."" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has vowed to continue standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine until their sovereignty is restored. ""We stand up for freedom. We fight bullies. We galvanise our allies around the world,"" she said. ""We cannot stand by to see freedom repressed and see the clock turned back to the horrific oppression of the Soviet era. We cannot and we will not rest until Ukraine's sovereignty is restored."" Concluding his speech in Blackpool, Ben Wallace welcomed Ukraine's ambassador Vadym Prystaiko to a raucous standing ovation from all those in attendance. Alister Jack describes how he managed to win over the ""initially sceptical"" SNP to back the UK Government's Freeports scheme, with two to be delivered in Scotland, reports Simon Johnson. ""Something you would have thought all parties in Scotland would welcome. Sadly there is still one that doesn’t: the Scottish Greens,"" he says, renewing his attack on Nicola Sturgeon entering a coalition with them. ""It just shows how irresponsible it was for the SNP to invite into government a party that is fundamentally opposed to economic growth. ""Even some people in the SNP are beginning to realise what a disastrous mistake that was."" Meanwhile, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack is giving his speech to the Scottish Tory conference in Aberdeen, reports Simon Johnson. He said: ""The people of Scotland rightly expect their two governments to work together because they understand it is the best way to unlock the potential of devolution. Now, it is not always easy to work with this SNP-Green Scottish Government. ""Of course it can be difficult trying to deliver the benefits of devolution alongside a Nationalist administration in Edinburgh that does not believe in devolution. An administration whose politics demand constant friction with the UK Government and a freshly brewed grievance every morning. They may not be able to manufacture a ferry, ladies and gentlemen, but they sure know how to manufacture a grievance."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace compared Vladimir Putin to the leader of Argentina during the Falklands War 40 years ago. He said that like Leopoldo Galtieri, Mr Putin had sent young soldiers to die for his own political reasons. ""Just like in 1982, Putin's arrogant assumptions have directly led to the casualties and attrition among the Russian army,"" Mr Wallace told the Tory spring conference in Blackpool. ""The Kremlin assumed that Ukraine would not fight - he was wrong. The Kremlin assumed his army was invincible - they were wrong. ""And they assumed the international community would splinter and they've been proven wrong."" Mr Wallace said that during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, mothers of those killed in action called the dead their ""boys in zinc"" because of the metal coffins they used. ""None of us should let today's Russian president forget to despite dozens of presidents and prime ministers urging him not to invade, the international community's calls for peace, he chose zinc."" Priti Patel has defended the Home Office's checks on Ukrainian refugees saying it is ""naive"" to believe that only men can pose a threat to the UK's security as she warns of heightened threat of chemical, biological and cyber attacks from Russia. ""I've been asked why couldn't we suspend security checks on people escaping Putin's war?"" she said. ""Times of conflict, my friends, emphasises our need to remain watchful. I know from the briefings I receive from the intelligence and security services that instability around the world brings with it greater threats."" ""Only four years ago, the Russian military intelligence services used a chemical weapon on British soil - it happened in Salisbury, whose inhabitants would have felt completely safe."" She added: ""The truth is that a very small number of people can wreak utter havoc and Russia has a history of covert, hostile activity."" ""And I'm afraid it is naive and misguided to think that only men can be covert operatives or that refugee flows would not be subject to some form of exploitation."" ""There are those who would come to our country, to this country, who would mean us harm and plot to strike at our very way of life."" Priti Patel has announced that illegal entry to the UK will impact on asylum claims made by migrants ""Access to the UK's asylum system should be based on need and not the ability to pay people smugglers. If you enter the UK illegally, via a safe country where you could have claimed asylum, you're not seeking refuge from peril, but picking the UK as a preferred destination,"" she said. ""For the first time, whether you enter the UK legally or illegally will impact on how your asylum claim progresses and on your status in the UK if your claim is successful."" Ms Patel also announced that the maximum sentence for people smuggling will increase from 15 years to life. The Home Secretary has said the UK will tighten controls on the UK financial system, including in the areas of money-laundering and cryptocurrency. ""No criminal or kleptocrat will be able to hide behind a UK shell company ever again,"" she vowed. Priti Patel reiterated in her speech that the UK is open to Ukrainian refugees. ""The British government and the people of the United Kingdom are utterly determined that Putin will fail in his war and that we will open our homes and our hearts to Ukrainians,"" she said. ""We will always stand for freedom and the values that are fundamental to our way of life."" ""As Ukrainians know as hell rains upon them, the United Kingdom stands with them in their hour of need."" Home Secretary Priti Patel has hailed the ""incredible"" repsonse by Poland to the refugee crisis. ""A few weeks ago I was on the Polish border with Ukraine. What I saw was a human tragedy on a heart-breaking and unprecedented scale,"" she said. ""What I also saw was the incredible response of our dear friends in Poland. From the government to volunteers who have mobilised an incredible response to welcome and manage refugees."" ""I saw the most remarkable humanitarian work from the government and people of Poland. I have to tell you, it broke my heart."" George Eustice concluded his speech by highlighting the need to keep supply chains open in order to ensure the world can remain fed despite Ukraine's wheat harvest being impacted by the invasion. ""In Ukraine today, the determination to get this year's crop in the ground shows that Ukraine is a country that believes in its future and that refuses to give up,"" he said. ""There is over 200 million tonnes of wheat in storage around the world at the moment. Those who operate the market need to be able to move stocks around freely in order to satisfy global demand."" ""The UK is largely self-sufficient in wheat production,"" he added ""But we are working with like-minded countries around the world to ensure the free flow continues."" The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has kicked off day two of the Conservative spring conference by paying tribute to the ""tenacity"" of Ukrainians and in particular the country's farmers. ""In recent weeks, we've all been moved by the incredible courage of Ukraine's president, the extraordinary bravery of the Ukrainian army and the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian people,"" he said. ""We have also seen the morale-boosting sight of Ukrainian farmers towing away Russian tanks with their tractors, just one of the many symbols of Ukraine's extraordinary tenacity."" Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said there was ""revulsion"" about P&O Ferries' actions in sacking 800 staff. He told Times Radio the Government was trying to establish whether the move was legal. ""That is why the Transport Secretary (Grant Shapps) has asked the Insolvency Service to look at the notification requirements, for example, and see whether further action is appropriate,"" Mr Dowden said. ""All of us feel, frankly, a revulsion at the kind of sharp practices from P&O. There has been a complete lack of engagement, a lack of prior notice or indeed any empathy whatsoever for the workers."" The Government has already said it is reviewing all contracts it has with P&O Ferries and its owner DP World. ""I think they should be in no doubt that the Government is considering very closely its relationship with them,"" Mr Dowden said.",World/The Telegraph,"Vladimir Putin in 'total panic' about revolution in Moscow, says Boris Johnson",https://news.yahoo.com/politics-latest-news-boris-johnson-085651405.html
3/20/2022,"STORY: The arrival of the latest cosmonaut team - warmly welcomed by four Americans, two Russians and a German crewmate already aboard - came a day after the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it had suspended a joint robotic rover mission to Mars with Russia due to the Ukraine conflict. The rendezvous with the space station capped a flight of three hours and 10 minutes following liftoff of the Soyuz spacecraft from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The durability of U.S.-Russian collaboration in space is being tested by heightened antagonism between the two former Cold War adversaries over Russia's three-week-old invasion of Ukraine. As part of U.S. economic sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's government last month, U.S. President Joe Biden ordered high-tech export restrictions against Moscow that he said were designed to ""degrade"" Russia's aerospace industry, including its space program. Dmitry Rogozin, director-general of Russian space agency Roscosmos, then lashed out in a series of Twitter posts suggesting the U.S. sanctions could ""destroy"" ISS teamwork and lead to the space station falling out of orbit. The space station was born in part from a foreign policy initiative to improve American-Russian relations following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Cold War hostility that spurred the original U.S.-Soviet space race. Rogozin's recent actions have prompted some in the U.S. space industry to rethink the NASA-Roscosmos partnership. NASA officials have said that U.S. and Russian ISS crew members, while aware of events on Earth, were still working together professionally and that geopolitical tensions had not affected the space station.",Science/Reuters Videos,New Russian cosmonaut team arrives at International Space Station,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-cosmonaut-team-arrives-international-040425685.html
3/20/2022,"More than 3 million Ukrainians have fled the only place they’ve ever called home since Russia invaded their country on Feb. 24, with most seeking refuge in neighboring European nations like Poland, Romania and Moldova. Almost all these countries have accepted fleeing Ukrainians with open arms. It’s a welcome sight for Ukrainians and migration experts alike — but also a somewhat curious one. The reception of Ukrainian refugees by European countries has been vastly different from previous refugee crises where European countries were largely resistant to being a safe haven for those escaping persecution, including the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis, where since 2015 more than 1 million Syrians have sought refuge in Europe with little to no support. “It's a striking difference,” Lamis Abdelaaty, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, told Yahoo News. Some experts believe that proximity is the most obvious reason for the discrepancy, as Ukraine shares a border with seven other European countries, while others have suggested cultural factors — commonality in race and religion — play the biggest part. In a Twitter thread earlier this month, Abdelaaty, author of “Discrimination and Delegation: Explaining State Responses to Refugees,” argues that the difference in treatment boils down to identity and foreign policy. “Ukrainians are seen as white, Christian,” Abdelaaty explained. “Syrians, Afghans, and others are not perceived this way. People sympathize with refugees who they think share their race, religion, etc. But identity is not the whole story.” “There is a foreign policy dimension to this too,” she added. “It matters that Ukrainians are fleeing a Russian invasion. Welcoming them is another way for European countries to condemn Putin and to powerfully signal which side of the conflict they are on.” NATO member countries throughout Europe have been cautious about their involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict thus far, choosing to supply weapons to Ukraine and apply financial sanctions to Russia instead of any direct confrontation that they argue could ignite a third world war. Even so, some critics see a double standard in how Ukrainian refugees are being treated compared with asylum seekers from other countries. Poland, which has accepted more than 60% of the 3 million Ukrainian refugees, was a big detractor of Syrian refugees just a few years ago. The leader of Poland's conservative party and current deputy prime minister, Jarosław Kaczyński, has been one of the most outspoken critics against refugees. In 2017, he said that accepting Syrians would be dangerous and would ""completely change our culture and radically lower the level of safety in our country."" Now European leaders are praising the continent’s largely unified response. “The response by Europe has been remarkable,” the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said in a statement. While European countries currently host more than 1 million of the 6.6 million Syrians who have fled civil war in their country in the past decade, the overwhelming majority have been accepted by only two countries — 59% live in Germany and 11% relocated to Sweden, according to data from the U.N. refugee agency. But accepting those refugees was a controversial decision, Kelly Petillo, coordinator of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told ABC News. “It came after quite a bit of internal back and forth and lack of disagreement,” Petillo said, noting that it wasn’t until after the European Union came to an agreement with Turkey that Syrians were accepted into the region. “Since the Syria crisis erupted more than 10 years ago, we’ve seen that there was a high level of reluctancy from Europeans to share the burden amongst themselves,” she said. Abdelaaty also notes a striking difference in the framing of the Syrian refugee crisis and the Ukrainian refugee crisis. “In 2016, [the Syrian refugee influx] was framed as a huge ‘crisis for Europe,’ and it was a crisis for how European countries were going to respond to this,” she said, adding that Syrians were labeled as migrants, not refugees, as a way to “delegitimize their request for protection.” Abdelaaty believes that the Ukrainian crisis is being framed in such a way that leads others to have empathy for those fleeing the conflict — which she says is the right thing to do, but questions why this courtesy hasn’t been extended for everyone. But not all experts agree that Europe’s warm reception to Ukrainian refugees is simply an issue of identity or foreign policy. Thomas Gammeltoft-Hansen, a professor of migration and refugee law at the University of Copenhagen and author of “Access to Asylum: International Refugee Law and the Globalization of Migration Control,” says there is another major factor at play. Long before Russia invaded Ukraine, Ukrainian leadership and the European Parliament had agreed on a visa liberation agreement in 2017, which granted Ukrainians visa-free access to all of Europe. Gammeltoft-Hansen says this makes it easier for European countries to accept Ukrainian refugees. “The preexisting mobility rights of the Ukrainians means that they circumvent the entire kind of deterrence logic upon which migration policy has been based for the last 30 years,” he told Yahoo News. “The mobility element upends everything we thought we knew about how the EU handles refugee flows.” According to Gammeltoft-Hansen, Europe’s response to the Balkan refugee crisis in 2015, the Southeast Asian refugee crisis in the 1970s and the Hungarian crisis in 1956 — which all resulted in European resettlement after substantial opposition — all suggest that both political context, not simply proximity, plays the primary role in the ongoing crisis. “The Ukrainian response looks a lot like some of the big refugee crises during the Cold War,” he said. “There is sometimes a willingness to welcome refugees as a way of scoring ideology points, which can be a way of politically signaling a a degree of affiliation rather than engaging in direct conflict.” Gammeltoft-Hansen describes the current refugee crisis in Europe as a “historically unique political and socioeconomic experiment” that will ultimately set a precedent on what allocation of resources looks like throughout the region and how countries can come together through “spontaneous responsibility sharing.” However, not all refugees fleeing Ukraine have had the same experience. African and Indian men and women, many of whom went to Ukraine to further their education, have regularly reported being denied space on trains or buses or faced ridicule at the border. They have complained of a sometimes hostile reception from Ukrainian authorities and officials from other European countries that have by and large taken in scores of Ukrainians. This disparity in treatment, for many, illustrates a hypocritical attitude they say has always been present across Europe. “There was a gap in the access Black people and brown people were getting,” Patricia Daley, one of three women who founded Black Women for Black Lives as a way to help Black people escape Ukraine, told NBC News. “There was no one offering their homes to Black people, no one offering to pick up the Black individuals. There was a tremendous amount of people offering help and support, but I feel like it was limited to Ukrainian nationals alone. And we know what that means. It’s excluding a group of people. There was a need to support Black people because they weren’t getting the support or access. There was a gap and we bridged it.” Damilare Yusef, a British-Nigerian man, said he jumped into crisis management mode when he saw the plight of African refugees trying to escape Ukraine. He used social media apps like Telegram and Twitter to coordinate help for those in need. “In the beginning it was important to have a clear message with Africans in Ukraine … so people understood the message of it’s not just Nigerians, it’s not just Ghanians,” Yusef told Yahoo News. “When you band together, it’s just easier.” As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth week, there is no doubt that the number of refugees seeking safety in European countries will continue. For Abdelaaty, the acceptance of those in need is necessary, but it shouldn’t stop at Ukrainians. “This is exactly what they should be doing,” she said. “But bring this empathy to other refugee groups, because the same scenes that we're seeing in Ukraine, we see in other refugee crises as well. ... All of these scenes are not unique to the Ukrainian refugee crisis.” _____ Cover thumbnail photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Spencer Platt/Getty Images, Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty Images",World/Yahoo News,Does the Ukrainian refugee response expose a European double standard?

In between remarks expressing sympathy for the victims of a 7.4-magnitude earthquake that hit eastern Japan on Wednesday and the war in Ukraine, she revealed a number of insights, including her views on love and marriage. The 20-year Imperial Princess also praised her cousin, Princess Mako, describing her ""like a dependable older sister."" After several years of controversy and postponements, Aiko's cousin gave up her royal titles to marry Kei Komuro, a commoner, last October. Mako and Kei met almost 10 years ago in college. Wed in very understated circumstances, the couple, both 30, have been living in New York City since their wedding.

3/20/2022,"An asteroid around the size of a refrigerator was spotted hours before it hit Earth's atmosphere, and while it wasn't dangerous, it marked the fifth time in history an asteroid was detected right before hitting our planet. On March 11, astronomer Krisztian Sarneczky noticed an asteroid at the Piszkéstető Observatory in Hungary. Sarneczky reported it to the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center, which confirmed it was the first time the asteroid had been observed. NASA's ""Scout"" system, which constantly searches the Minor Planet Center's database for any potential impacts, then calculated the asteroid's orbit, finding that the asteroid would certainly hit Earth. The system then notified the Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and other asteroid impact systems. Luckily for Earth, the asteroid, named 2022 EB5, was around 6½-feet-long, a size ""too small to pose a hazard to Earth,"" NASA said in a statement. ""Scout"" determined the asteroid would enter Earth's atmosphere around Jan Mayen, a Norwegian island roughly 300 miles northeast of Iceland. At 5:23 p.m. EDT, two hours after the asteroid was first spotted by Sarneczky, the asteroid hit Earth's atmosphere just as ""Scout"" predicted. It was the fifth time an asteroid was spotted hours before it hit Earth and the first time it's happened since 2019. ""Scout had only 14 observations over 40 minutes from one observatory to work with when it first identified the object as an impactor. We were able to determine the possible impact locations, which initially extended from western Greenland to off the coast of Norway,"" said Davide Farnocchia, a navigation engineer who developed Scout. ""As more observatories tracked the asteroid, our calculations of its trajectory and impact location became more precise."" The International Meteor Organization said no meteorites from the asteroid have been recovered, but some people in Iceland reported seeing bright flashes, indicating the space rock became a fireball. Paul Chodas, director of the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, said asteroids like 2022 EB5 enter Earth's atmosphere around every 10 months, but it's hard to spot one before it's already entered the atmosphere. ""Very few of these asteroids have actually been detected in space and observed extensively prior to impact, basically because they are very faint until the last few hours, and a survey telescope has to observe just the right spot of sky at the right time for one to be detected,"" Chodas said. Close call: 230-foot wide asteroid initially expected to hit Earth in 2023 was false alarm Asteroid and dinosaurs: New research says asteroid that killed the dinosaurs hit Earth in the spring While this asteroid snuck up on astronomers, there is no need to worry about a bigger, catastrophic asteroid doing the same. NASA said larger asteroids are easier to spot and can be found far in advance. The agency noted this asteroid showed their systems can be highly accurate in projecting an object's likely impact location and would help planetary defense systems to be fully prepared. NASA is testing its planetary defense systems should a dangerous asteroid ever threatens to hit Earth. NASA launched the DART system in November, which will hit the asteroid moon of Didymos in September, with the goal of determining whether crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid could change its course.

3/20/2022,"Four private jets went to Dubai from Russia on Thursday. It is not clear why those jets left, but many wealthy Russians are making efforts to leave. This week Putin pledged a ""self-cleansing"" of Russian society, seemingly targeted at the rich. Four private jets left leaving Russia for Dubai on Thursday, after Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged a ""self-cleansing"" of Russian society. Danish analyst Oliver Alexander observed the four jets leaving Moscow for Dubai on Thursday morning using flight tracking service FlightRadar24. He described it as an ""exodus."" —Oliver Alexander (@OAlexanderDK) March 17, 2022 Insider verified the routes the four jets took via flight-tracking websites. It is not clear who was on board the planes or what reason they had for heading to Dubai, which, unlike Western destinations, has not banned Russian air traffic. Private jets were also seen going from Russia to Israel earlier this month as Western sanctions on Russian oligarchs began to bite. Thousands of people have tried to flee Russia since it started its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Insider previously reported, fearing what life there would be like as it is increasingly isolated from the rest of the world. Some Russians who left told Insider's Sophia Ankel that they left because they were afraid of detention and other crackdowns in the country, and were also afraid of Russia's economic situations after so many countries implemented sanctions over the invasion. Putin said in a speech on Wednesday that Russia has to undergo a ""self-cleansing of society"" following its invasion of Ukraine. He said: ""The collective West is attempting to splinter our society, speculating on military losses, on socioeconomic effects of sanctions, in order to provoke a people's rebellion in Russia."" He appeared to threaten people who were not supportive of the government: ""But any people, the Russian people, especially, are able to distinguish true patriots from bastards and traitors and will spit them out."" ""I am certain that this necessary and natural self-cleansing of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity, togetherness, and our readiness to answer any calls to action,"" he continued. In the speech, Putin appeared to have wealthy, pro-Western Russians in mind, highlighting those with properties in France or the US who are used to eating oysters and foie gras.   Read the original article on Business Insider",World/Business Insider,Private jets are leaving Russia for Dubai after Putin threatened to purge Russian society of traitors,https://news.yahoo.com/private-jets-leaving-russia-dubai-102310773.html
3/20/2022,"In deep-blue Broward County, throngs of former President Donald Trump’s supporters flocked to the edge of the Everglades Saturday clad in red, white and blue to see America’s 45th president and other conservatives speak at the latest stop of the American Freedom Tour. Anna Italino, a 21-year-old from Deerfield Beach accompanied by her three young friends clad in an assortment of “Let’s Go Brandon” merchandise, was pumped to see Trump for the first time. “He’s honest and for real,” she said. “We are very excited, and we want to hear everything.” Italino has stood by Trump since 2016, even with little sentiment from others in her generation, she said. “It’s frustrating really because people are very close-minded and don’t want Trump just because he is honest,” Italino said. READ MORE: The American Freedom Tour with Trump is under way in Broward. Here’s what’s happening now. Italino was among a large crowd of conservatives who paid to see Trump and surrogates such as conservative pundit Candace Owens talk at the private event, held at FLA Live Arena in Sunrise. Tickets ranged in price from $9 to $6,999. An American Freedom Tour representative told the Miami Herald that ticket fees would go towards paying speakers and the cost of putting on the event. (The event did not offer credentials to the media, so the Herald paid the cheapest price of admission to enter the arena and cover the event.) Italino said she is hoping to see Trump on a 2024 ticket with Owens as his running mate. “We want to see Trump back in office because [President] Joe Biden is doing nothing,” Italino said. With Trump set to speak in the late afternoon, a sea of red started hours prior from the stadium’s parking lot to the entrance as dozens of cars dawned an array of Trump flags, including “Trump 2024” and “Make America Great Again.” Attendees wore MAGA hats and draped campaign flags over their shoulders. They came from all around.

Sylvia Dudley, a 72-year-old who just moved from Michigan to the West Palm Beach area, said she was excited to see Trump for the first time. “We drive by his house [at Mar-a-Lago] ... and we get excited and say, ‘Yay Trump! Keep at it!’” she said. “We needed him because he is a person who you punch him and keeps getting back up.” Dudley also felt it a duty to come and support. “We want to show the country we are for these conservative values, which the Republicans have,” she said. “Trump especially led the way in bringing our country back, and we want to support him and let him know that we want him back....” The hot Florida sun was in full force, pounding down on many eager to escape the heat. Inside, they found air conditioning and Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son and a featured speaker of the event, signing copies of his father’s photo book “Our Journey Together.” Genie Samuel, a 66-year-old who has lived in Florida since the 90s, said she thinks Trump is the target of vitriol. “Sometimes I wish people would have a little less hate in their hearts.” She isn’t as sure that Trump will run in 2024 as others are, but says she is looking for someone who cares. “It would be nice just to have someone to come in and care about our people,” Samuel said. “No violence. Changes need to be made, but I still don’t think violence is the answer. What do I hope for? Peace on Earth.” Trump graced the stage after 5 p.m., beginning his speech following a clip of a monologue from the 1970 film “Patton” played on Jumbotrons that included talk of killing Nazis. As “God Bless the U.S.A” by Lee Greenwood blared on speakers overhead, Trump ran down a checklist of what he said are the failings of the Biden administration — including inflation, the exit of the U.S. military from Afghanistan and the “assault” of American “heritage.” “As I stand before you today, Joe Biden and the socialist left are reeling havoc on our nation at a record speed,” he said. He stated that in the 2022 midterm elections America will be taken over by a “red wave.” And he continued to falsely claim that he won the 2020 election — and tease a run in 2024. “We won twice,” he said, referring to 2016 and 2020. “And we may have to do it again.” Miami Herald staff writer Bianca Padró Ocasio contributed to this report.",Politics/Miami Herald,Thousands of supporters were pumped to see Trump.
