4/4/2022,"Louis van Gaal, the Netherlands coach and former Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Ajax manager, has revealed he has been receiving treatment for an “aggressive” form of prostate cancer. Van Gaal, 70, speaking to the RTL TV show Humberto on Sunday, revealed he has been receiving treatment while continuing to train the Dutch team but had not informed his players of his condition. He said he plans to carry on in his role in leading the Dutch team in this year’s World Cup. “I think you don’t tell people you work with like that because it might influence their choices, their decisiveness, so I thought they shouldn’t know,’ he said. “You don’t die from prostate cancer, at least not in 90% of the cases. “It is usually other underlying diseases that kill you. But I had a pretty aggressive form, got irradiated 25 times. Then you have a lot of management to do in order to get through life.” Van Gaal is in his third stint in charge of the national team, having led the team to a third-placed finish at the World Cup in 2014 before joining Manchester United. The Dutch were drawn in Group A for this year’s World Cup alongside tournament hosts Qatar, Ecuador and Senegal, who they will play in the tournament’s first match in Doha on 21 November. “I did have preferential treatment in the hospital,” Van Gaal said. “I was allowed in through the back door when I went to an appointment and was immediately pushed into another room. I have been treated wonderfully. “You will of course tell your friends and relatives about it,” he said, when asked about keeping his illness secret. “The fact that nothing has come out yet also says something about my environment. That’s great.” His coaching career spanning almost four decades, Van Gaal has won league titles with Barcelona, Ajax, Bayern Munich and AZ Alkmaar, winning the Champions League with Ajax in 1995. He spent two seasons at United, leading the club to the FA Cup in 2016 before being sacked days later.",Sport/Football,Louis van Gaal reveals he has been receiving prostate cancer treatment,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/03/louis-van-gaal-reveals-he-has-been-receiving-prostate-cancer-treatment
4/4/2022,"Mikel Arteta says the only mind games he intends to play over the season’s run-in will be with his own players, rejecting the temptation to engage in speculation with his counterparts over its outcome. The Arsenal manager was asked if he agreed with Antonio Conte’s suggestion last month that his team are favourites to take fourth place – a statement that did not anticipate the fact third could also be up for grabs if Chelsea continue to stutter – and whether that status would put pressure on them. He refused to get drawn in and said psychological tactics will be most effectively deployed internally. “I don’t know, that is a question for him,” Arteta said. “But what we want to do is very clear, and the perception of what people think is not going to change it.” On the topic of mind games, he said: “I do it more with my players, I think. I do it more with the players, if I have to.” Invited to elaborate, he joked: “No! Because they will know what they are doing and that is the whole point.” Arsenal’s horizons have shifted immeasurably since losing their opening three games and they visit Crystal Palace on Monday night in search of a seventh win in eight. Arteta said he has no concerns about his young squad’s capacity to deal with the change in expectation. “There is nothing different, they have already been dealing with it for weeks,” he said. “Because this is a conversation we have had now for over six to eight weeks, so they have already been through that and have responded really, really well so there is nothing new because they have already been doing it and capable of doing it.” Bernd Leno will continue in goal at Selhurst Park unless Aaron Ramsdale recovers ahead of schedule from a hip injury. The Germany international has been in the cold this season and his appearance in the victory at Aston Villa was his first in the top flight since August. Arteta praised the 30-year-old’s attitude but does not regret confining him to the bench. “This is football and it’s not an individual sport,” he said. “When he’s been playing for 10 years that meant someone has been there waiting for that opportunity, and I have a lot of sympathy with every player that doesn’t play and doesn’t get the chances they probably deserve but unfortunately that’s the game. “He’s done a very similar thing to Cédric [Soares] and Nico [Pépé]. Not accepting the situation but trying to improve it. And then he’s been consistent in the way he trained, the way he behaved, in those months, waiting for the opportunity and, when he had it, to take it.”",Sport/Football,Arsenal’s Arteta ignores Conte’s favourite tag and will focus on own team,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/03/arsenals-arteta-ignores-contes-favourite-tag-and-will-focus-on-own-team
4/4/2022,"Over the course of the past decade and more, as men’s tennis has continued to see unprecedented dominance by a select few legends, the lingering question has been what will follow Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer when they are truly gone. So many new waves of new players have risen to immense fanfare, and so many have already fallen away, but during this period there has never been an arrival like the emergence of Carlos Alcaraz. Turning 19 next month, and in his first full season as a top 100 player, the Spaniard continued his delirious breakthrough year as he became a Masters 1000 champion for the first time in his career, defeating Casper Ruud 7-5, 6-4 to win the Miami Open, his third title. With this victory, he is the third youngest ATP Masters 1000 champion in history, behind Nadal and Michael Chang. He has an astounding record this year of 18 wins and two defeats, having won 28 of his last 31 sets, two of which were taken by Nadal himself. In Miami alone, Alcaraz toppled three top-10 opponents with wins against the No 5 Stefanos Tsitsipas, the defending champion Hubert Hurkacz and Ruud. Having been ranked 133rd exactly a year ago, he is now on the verge of joining them with his new ranking of 11. Alcaraz’s breakthrough has been propelled by a game that is already so well-rounded, lethal both in defence and attack, and its only clear hole is the precision of his serve. His forehand is an utterly destructive weapon yet his backhand is also extremely potent and reliable; he is an excellent returner, surely the fastest player on the tour right now and his variety is a defining point of his game, from his copious drop shots to his willingness to come to the net. Those strengths are tied together by his innate intelligence, with his immense ability to problem solve and choose the correct shot at the right time. Throughout this week and year, all of that has translated into so much absurd shotmaking along with his victories. A measure of just how much attention and excitement Alcaraz has generated was reflected in the Miami crowd’s loud support for him, with even a double fault from Ruud in the second point of the match prompting widespread applause. Alcaraz was out of sync early on, spraying forehands and telegraphing drop shots, but throughout the past month he has rapidly learned how to produce his best level under pressure. From 1-4 down, Alcaraz became a wall with his return of serve, he found the court with forehand hammer blows and he continually closed down points at the net. He won nine of the following 10 games and in the end, he simply had too much game for the eighth best player in the world: “I have no words to describe how I feel right now,” he said. “It’s so special to win my first Masters 1000 here in Miami. I have an unbelievable team with me.” Such prodigious talent can lend itself to overconfidence, but Alcaraz’s humility has been striking. In his semi-final against Hurkacz, he offered to replay a point after an umpire error. His coach, the former No 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero, was not in Miami after the recent death of his father so Alcaraz punctuated each win by writing messages of support to hismentor on the camera. On Saturday, Ferrero surprised Alcaraz by flying into Miami for the final and he was the first person Alcaraz sought out upon his victory. As they embraced, Ferrero cried on to his charge’s shoulder. Meanwhile, 20-year-old Jack Draper defeated Zizou Bergs 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 to win the ATP Challenger event in St Brieuc, France, already his fourth challenger title of the season after just three months. Draper, Great Britain’s most promising men’s player, will rise to a career high of 124 after starting the year ranked 265. It is only a matter of time before he reaches the top 100, offering him direct entry into the biggest tournaments.",Sport/Sport,Carlos Alcaraz confirms arrival among elite with Miami Open win,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/03/carlos-alcaraz-confirms-arrival-among-elite-with-miami-open-win
