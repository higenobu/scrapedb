4/14/2022,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk posted in a thread on Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) last month advising followers to own “physical things” when inflation is high. In the tweet, Musk said “As a general principle, for those looking for advice from this thread, it is generally better to own physical things like a home or stock in companies you think make good products, than dollars when inflation is high. I still own & won’t sell my Bitcoin, Ethereum or Doge fwiw.” The biggest takeaway for some followers seems to have been that Musk is still holding his Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) because the cryptocurrency’s price saw a temporary spike shortly after the tweet. However, the more important point to Musk’s message is that physical assets are generally the safest investment during times of high inflation. This message coming from the “Dogefather” himself should speak volumes. With inflation hitting another 40-year high in March, it's becoming increasingly important for investors to consider diversifying their portfolios with physical assets. Here are three that have historically performed well during periods of high inflation. Real Estate While Musk referenced owning a home, real estate, in general, performs well for investors during years of high inflation. Specifically, single-family homes, multifamily, self-storage and farmland. Running out to buy a property may not be the most feasible option for most investors right now, but luckily there are options available to buy shares of fractionalized real estate. Investors can buy shares of rental properties for as little as 0, or invest in large-scale multifamily developments in some of the fastest-growing cities in the country.

Fine Art Art has been a popular method of storing wealth for generations, which is no surprise considering that it has outperformed the S&P 500 for the past 25 years and appreciates at an average rate of 23.2% in years where inflation is at least 3%. This type of investment used to be available only to the ultra-wealthy. However, retail investors now have options to buy shares of valuable works of art. See also: Benzinga’s top art offerings. Farmland Farmland acreage is shrinking across the country at a rate of over 1 million acres per year, while the global demand for food is steadily rising. Going by the laws of supply and demand, the likelihood of farmland seeing significant increases in value seems high. See also: Farmland offerings on Benzinga.

4/14/2022,"The first quarter of 2022 has been difficult for retirement savers and retirees alike, and according to investment firm Charles Schwab, it was one of the worst quarters for fixed-income in decades. However, the rising yields and changed Federal Reserve policy have created a prime buying opportunity, says the investment giant. After nearly three years of near-zero interest on fixed income, retirement savers can finally earn attractive returns. But don't go and buy just any bonds: look specifically for intermediate- to long-term bonds. Here's why. A financial advisor could help you plan for retirement and help you select low-risk investments that align with your financial goals. Speak to a qualified advisor today. Fed Tightening Creates Buying Opportunity The beginning of 2022 saw a marked increase in bond yields, a steep sell-off and a change in Federal Reserve policy all in the span of a couple months. Previously Charles Schwab had recommended that fixed income investors stick to short-term assets to cut exposure risk, but with the most recent quarter's dreadful performance, change seems to be in the air. Schwab analysts say it may seem counterintuitive to buy bonds just as the Federal Reserve embarks on a series of interest rate hikes–which are inversely related to bond prices–but the market has actually already discounted much of the expected drops in price. Why Will Bonds Recover Now? There are a couple indications that Schwab analysts say point to a buying opportunity. The bond yield curve jumped and has maintained a high level, which means that the market is already discounting a fast pace of Fed rate hikes. Even though the Fed has only raised interest rates once thus far, the yield curve signals a lot of future rate hikes being priced in–so many, in fact, that the number of hikes would have to extend into 2024 to make sense. Another indicator is the real level of inflation affecting the economy. Due to rising commodity prices, Schwab analysts expect inflation to remain high through the end of the year, when levels should ease again in response to changed Federal Reserve policy. The economy already appears to be cooling, as rising interest rates moderate housing demand and capital goods expenditures. As a result, retirement savers shouldn't worry too much about inflation affecting their fixed income investments in the medium term. Charles Schwab analysts said that ""inflation expectations appear reasonably contained. The markets are discounting high inflation in the near term, but…an aggressive tightening cycle [by the Fed] will pull it lower in the longer term."" Although short-term inflation expectations are at the highest level since 1981, long-term inflation is expected to remain near 3%, a long-term average dating back to the 1990s. How Retirement Savers Can Take Advantage Given the market's reaction to rising interest rates and expected inflation levels over the upcoming year, Charles Schwab asserts that the intermediate to long-term bond outlook is positive. Signs from the yield curve indicate that a peak in yields may be getting closer, which supports the recommendation to buy longer-term bonds. The company acknowledges that there may remain some pricing risk if high levels of inflation continue, but the likelihood appears small given the Fed's willingness to tighten monetary policy. Investors can buy intermediate- and long-term bonds through bond funds, which typically offer higher yields for longer bond terms. The higher yields also carry greater interest rate risk, however, stemming from interest rate movements and inflation levels. Which assets are most appropriate for you depends on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Bottom Line Investment firm Charles Schwab has found that now may be a good time to add longer-term bonds to your fixed income portfolio. A combination of rising bond yields and planned interest rate hikes points to a relatively-advantageous entry point for intermediate- and long-term bond investing, which can help investors boost their retirement savings and income over time.

4/14/2022,"Despite the vast depth of information and education available today, financial literacy isn't improving among adults in the U.S. A financial advisor can help you improve your financial literacy to better understand your money. Find a fiduciary advisor today. On average, American adults correctly answered only 50% of the questions in the 2022 Personal Finance Index, an annual survey conducted by the TIAA Institute and the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center (GFLEC) at the George Washington University School of Business. Since researchers from the TIAA and George Washington University started gauging financial literacy among adults in 2017, functional knowledge hasn't improved. The area where people struggle the most? Understanding financial risk. Here's a look at the survey's findings and some of the questions that were asked. Financial Literacy Isn't Improving Unfortunately, this year's survey and previous studies have revealed that many adults in the U.S. function with a poor understanding of financial topics. On average, U.S. adults answered only 50% of the index questions correctly in 2022, a figure that has remained steady since 2017. While only 18% of respondents could correctly answer between 76% and 100% of the 28 questions that were posed in this year's survey, nearly a quarter of adults (23%) incorrectly answered at least 75% of questions. What's worse, the percentage of adults with poor financial literacy is on the rise. In 2020, only 17% of respondents got three-quarters of the questions wrong. Assessing financial risk is the one area where functional knowledge is consistently lowest among U.S. adults, the survey found. Only 36% of questions related to risk were answered correctly, a 3% drop from the first survey in 2017. ""Comprehending risk involves, for example, understanding that the expected outcome in a given scenario depends on the range of possible outcomes, the financial implication associated with each outcome and the likelihood of each outcome occurring,"" according to the study. Which financial topic are American adults most knowledgeable about? Borrowing money. On average, 60% of questions related to borrowing were answered correctly, followed by questions focusing on saving (53%) and consuming (52%), the survey found. Can You Answer These Questions Correctly? TIAA shared with SmartAsset a sampling of the questions that respondents were asked as part of the 2022 survey. The questions touch on financial risk, as well as how interest accrues on savings and how it impacts a loan balance. Here are three questions that were part of the 2022 survey: There's a 50/50 chance that Malik's car will need engine repairs within the next six months which would cost $1,000. At the same time there is a 10% chance that he will need to replace the air conditioning unit in his house, which would cost $4,000. Which poses the greater financial risk for Malik? Anna saves $500 each year for 10 years and then stops saving additional money. At the same time, Charlie saves nothing for 10 years but then receives a $5,000 gift, which he decides to save. If both Anna and Charlie earn a 5% return each year, who will have more money in savings after 20 years? Jose owes $1,000 on a loan that has an interest rate of 20% per year compounded annually. If he makes no payments on the loan, at this interest rate, how many years will it take for the amount he owes to double? (Possible answers: less than 5 years; 5 to 10 years; More than 10 years; Don't know) Answers: 1.Despite the air conditioning repair potentially costing Malik $4,000, the likelihood of a $1,000 car repair is far greater, meaning it poses a more significant financial risk. 2. Anna would have more money after 20 years than Charlie, considering her savings would have a 10-year head start to accumulate interest. 3. If your answer to the third question was ""less than 5 years,"" you would have been among the respondents who answered it correctly. Without making payments on his car loan, Jose's loan balance would double within four years. Why Financial Literacy Matters The TIAA-GFLEC points to a direct correlation between financial literacy and financial well-being. The more knowledge adults have about the money, the better off they are. The survey found those with low levels of financial literacy are six times more likely to have difficulty making ends meet compared to adults with high levels of financial literacy. They're also five times as likely to lack enough emergency savings to cover one month of expenses and three times more likely to be unable to withstand a $2,000 financial shock. ""It is evident again that greater financial literacy tends to translate into higher financial well-being and lower financial literacy is generally associated with lower financial well-being,"" the study's authors concluded. Meanwhile, a separate study calculated how much a lack of financial literacy could actually be costing someone. At the end of 2021, the National Financial Educators Council (NFEC) conducted a survey among 3,389 adults and found that the average adult loses about $1,389 annually due to a lack of financial knowledge, including personal finance and investments. Bottom Line Unfortunately, financial literacy isn't improving among American adults. On average, respondents to the 2022 TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index correctly answered only half of the questions, a troubling figure that has hasn't improved since the survey's first year in 2017. Comprehending financial risk is the one area where adults need the most improvement, as only 36% of questions related to risk were answered correctly in 2022.

4/14/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett needed just two weeks to put together Berkshire Hathaway Inc's $11.6 billion takeover of Alleghany Corp, its largest acquisition in six years, even as he balked at paying the insurer's banking fee, a regulatory filing on Monday shows. Alleghany said its Chief Executive Officer Joseph Brandon met with Buffett for dinner in New York City on March 7, where after some ""casual conversation"" Buffett offered $850 per share in cash for the company, less the fee for bankers at Goldman Sachs. Five days later, Brandon and Alleghany Chairman Jefferson Kirby met Buffett in Omaha, Nebraska, where Kirby asked Buffett to make a higher offer, pay Goldman's $27 million fee, or use Berkshire stock to fund part of the purchase. ""Mr. Buffett reiterated the terms of his original offer, indicating firmly he did not intend to change his position on those points,"" the filing said. Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, ultimately agreed to pay $848.02 per share, with the $1.98 difference from $850 accounting for Goldman's fee. The merger was announced on March 21. Alleghany got 25 days to potentially find a better offer. Goldman has since asked 31 potential bidders about their interest, the filing said. The ""go-shop"" period ends on April 14. Brandon led Berkshire's General Re unit from 2001 to 2008. Buffett, 91, has long objected to the costs of doing business on Wall Street. He rarely uses investment banks at Berkshire, relying on 98-year-old Vice Chairman Charlie Munger for help in major capital decisions. Buffett has praised former Goldman banker Byron Trott, working with him on purchases of food distributor McLane Co from Walmart Inc and a large stake in truck stop operator Pilot Flying J from the family of billionaire Jimmy Haslam. The Alleghany purchase is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory and Alleghany shareholder approvals. Berkshire's last major acquisition was the $32.1 billion purchase of aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts in 2016.
