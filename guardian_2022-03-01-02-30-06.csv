3/1/2022,"The pocket watch owned by Edgar Allan Poe while he was writing his famous short story The Tell-Tale Heart, in which the murderous narrator compares the thumping of his victim’s heart to the tick of a clock, has been donated to the Poe Museum in Richmond, Virginia. Literary collector Susan Jaffe Tane gave the watch along with almost 60 other artefacts, including letters and rare first editions. Curator Chris Semtner said Poe’s timepiece was “especially important” because the author owned it while writing the story. “This might just be the very watch Poe was envisioning when he described the old man’s heartbeat as ‘a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton’,” said Semtner. Poe’s narrator is speaking to the police when he hears the sound, and it quickly drives him mad – and to a confession: “I felt that I must scream or die! – and now – again! – hark! louder! louder! louder! louder! – ‘Villains!’ I shrieked, ‘dissemble no more! I admit the deed! — tear up the planks! — here, here! – it is the beating of his hideous heart!’” Aptly for an author known for his tales and poems of the macabre, the donation also includes a fragment from the original coffin in which Poe was buried in 1849. His body was exhumed and moved across the cemetery in 1875, but the coffin broke – and the author fell out. “Poe wrote so many stories about being buried alive that it seems only fitting that we have a piece of the very coffin in which he was buried,” said Semtner. The engagement ring given by Poe to Sarah Elmira Royster Shelton has also been donated to the museum by Jaffe Tane. The pair were engaged as teenagers, but her father broke their engagement. They later became engaged for a second time, in the last month’s of Poe’s life, and he gave her the ring engraved with the name Edgar. He died 10 days before they would have been married. According to the Poe Museum, Shelton later claimed that Poe told her she inspired his final poem Annabel Lee. “I was a child and she was a child, / In this kingdom by the sea, / But we loved with a love that was more than love – / I and my Annabel Lee,” wrote Poe in the 1849 poem. “Her highborn kinsmen came / And bore her away from me, / To shut her up in a sepulchre / In this kingdom by the sea.” The Encyclopaedia Britannica cites Poe’s young wife and cousin Virginia – who died in 1847 – as another potential inspiration for the poem. The two married when Virginia was 13. “The Poe Museum is honoured to provide a permanent home for this transformative addition to its collection. Ms Tane’s generous gift furthers our mission to illuminate Poe for everyone, evermore,” said the Poe Museum’s executive director Maeve Jones, with a nod to Poe’s poem The Raven. “The Poe Museum looks forward to unveiling these incredible artefacts over the course of its centennial anniversary in 2022.” The items will be on show to the public from 28 April.",Arts/Books,Edgar Allan Poe’s pocket watch among donations to museum,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/28/edgar-allan-poes-pocket-watch-among-donations-to-museum
3/1/2022,"As preparations for entertaining the Premier League leaders go, a hectic week in which Peterborough United reappointed Grant McCann as manager following the surprise resignation of Darren Ferguson then sunk to the bottom of the Championship after losing 3-0 at home to Hull at least proved character-building. “It has been insane,” says Stewart Thompson, one of the club’s three co-owners. “We had our three most important games, we had a change of manager, we have Man City coming up … ridiculous is the best word. It’s been an absolute gong show.” Perhaps the FA Cup fifth round will provide some light relief. How do Posh view a sold-out match against Pep Guardiola’s side when skirting relegation remains at the forefront of their minds? “Umm … a free hit?” says Thompson who, alongside fellow Canada-based investor Jason Neale, acquired a 50% stake in the club in 2018. “Last season we got taken out [in the second round] by a team in the second tier of non-league [Chorley], four divisions below us. So if somebody can do it to us, we can do it to them, too. But it is just as realistic that we get absolutely hurt by seven. None of us have a clue what is going to happen on Tuesday and that is just the magic of the Cup, isn’t it?” It would appear a daunting task for a Peterborough team struggling to stay afloat in the second tier. They have lost five of their past six games, including a narrow defeat to leaders Fulham who shipped four goals at City in the previous round. Ferguson departed after a deflating stoppage-time defeat at fellow strugglers Derby. Thompson concedes McCann replacing Ferguson, who had three spells in charge of the club, could look like “lazy hiring by three owners who always go back to the well” but believes the Northern Irishman, who was sacked in 2018, when the club was 10th in League One, is the perfect fit. “I wonder how the process would have gone if Grant hadn’t been available, so there’s a bit of that timing that is fortuitous. Some might call it fate.” McCann, who spent five years at Peterborough as a midfielder, knows playing City will be a psychological challenge. “I take myself back to when I was playing,” he says. “Confidence can get low when you haven’t won games but it is about trying to change that culture. It’s an opportunity to go and show everyone what we’re about. Yes, they’re one of the best teams in the world but we’ve got to embrace it. The boys need to play with a smile on their face and see what happens.” The starting XI against Hull on Saturday had an average age of 24 and only five of those had played in the division before this season. “We’ve had such a great history of ‘young and hungry’ and it just hasn’t clicked yet this year,” says Thompson. “We might be the only club that hasn’t had a run of three or four games to get some wind in the sails. Every step has been a slog … [but] we’ve still got time.” Peterborough sold Siriki Dembele to Bournemouth in January, the winger becoming the latest in a long line of forwards to depart for a club higher up the food chain. Ivan Toney, Britt Assombalonga and Dwight Gayle made their names at London Road. Harrison Burrows, 20, and, at the other end of the pitch, the centre-back Ronnie Edwards, 18, have both been given a platform to impress this season. Thompson does not gloss over an “entire season of tie your shoelaces together” but insists the squad is good enough to stay up. “I am really disappointed with how we’ve done. I might be biased but I think Grant has way more tools in the locker here than he did at Hull.” The thought of City coming to town takes Thompson back to a scene in The Damned United where Derby’s Brian Clough, in readiness for the arrival of Don Revie and Leeds at the Baseball Ground in the third round of the Cup in 1968, carefully lays out oranges inside the away dressing room, sweeps the floor and scrubs the tiles. “There is an element of that with this [City] team coming to the home of the Posh,” he says. “It is the poor cousins hosting Jeff Bezos at the house. I’m looking forward to City because I finally get to go to a game with no pressure.”",Sport/Football,Peterborough look to end ‘ridiculous’ spell with Manchester City upset,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/28/peterborough-look-to-end-ridiculous-spell-with-manchester-city-upset
3/1/2022,"A wave of “sex mayhem” has apparently been sweeping New York City, prompting residents to lodge an increasing number of noise complaints to a government helpline. New York is no stranger to noise complaints – New Yorkers file as many as 75,000 a month – but new 311 call data obtained by Patch has revealed that many recent complaints arise from those disturbed by their neighbors’ late-night ventures. From 19 February 2021 to 9 February 2022, the website reported, the official helpline received 277 complaints about noisy sex. Queens produced the most, with 103. Manhattan came second with 66 while Brooklyn produced 55, the Bronx 48 and Staten Island four. In Cross Bay Boulevard, in Queens, 56 complaints were logged about “hippies” allegedly dressing up as Freddy Kreuger, Pennywise and the Easter Bunny while engaging in coital revelry as the theme song of Velveteen Dream, a pro wrestler, blasted in the background. “They’re still here causing a sex mayhem,” a neighbor complained one day at 6am. “Thought it was too cold outside for an orgy party. Doesn’t stop this guy.” Another Queens resident said: “For the love of God, stop these sex addicts … O to the R to the G to the Y. If you know how to spell and read that is ‘orgy’.” In Greenwood Heights, in Brooklyn, a resident said that they had slept through natural disasters but their neighbor’s activities were now keeping them up. “To get a sense of how disruptive they are, I’ve slept through earthquakes and fires in my life … I couldn’t sleep through this,” the resident wrote last April, in a complaint lodged at 2.45am. Someone else reported: “[She] makes the bed squeak as if it’s an Olympics event.” Another said: “Ceiling shaking and debris falling sex.” Complaints obtained by Patch also revealed that New Yorkers have been involuntarily privy to bedroom narrations aligned with current events. On 23 December at 11pm, for one seasonal example, a resident in East Harlem, in Manhattan, said: “Some guy is singing jingle balls at the top of his voice … Another person is screaming [‘Y]es daddy come down my chimney.’” Last spring, when the federal government distributed Covid-19 stimulus checks as part of the American Rescue Plan, one Bronx resident complained at 12:45am: “Loud banging and moaning. Heard the neighbor saying, ‘How’s this STIMMY baby!’” In a statement to Patch, a New York police spokesperson, Sophia Mason, said the NYPD took all quality of life complaints seriously. “[We] will continue to monitor and address all complaints,” she said.",News/US news,"Shaking ceilings, raunchy songs: complaints of New Yorkers’ noisy sex are rising",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/28/new-yorkers-complaints-noisy-sex
3/1/2022,"The Charity Commission has contacted Chelsea’s charitable foundation to ask for more information about Roman Abramovich’s plan to pass the care and stewardship of the club to the organisation’s trustees, who are yet to agree to the new arrangement. Abramovich’s decision to relinquish the running of Chelsea came after a call in parliament for him to face sanctions and the move has come under growing scrutiny since it was announced on Saturday evening. The Russian has not given up his ownership of the club and the foundation’s trustees are understood to feel that there are legal and regulatory problems, as well as ethical concerns, over the change of stewardship. There are several unanswered questions over the move and the trustees are unsure about whether running a football club would be compatible with charity law. They do not know who they would be answerable to, whether a separate entity would need to be created and whether there would be liability over future decisions. It also remains unclear whether sanctions will be imposed on Abramovich, while Chelsea are at risk of being in a vulnerable financial position if their owner is targeted by the UK government. Abramovich, who has vehemently denied that he has any links to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned, was said to have reached his decision to transfer the stewardship because of the increased focus on him following the invasion of Ukraine. The haste with which the move was made was said to have surprised the trustees, who were not consulted before the decision was made on Saturday. However nothing has been agreed yet and the move has attracted the attention of the Charity Commission, who have also received a report from Chelsea’s foundation. A Charity Commission spokesperson said: “We have contacted the charity seeking information and, in line with our guidance, the charity has also made a report to the Commission. We cannot comment further at this time.” The Charity Commission’s response will be a consideration for some trustees as they ponder how to move forward. It is understood that some trustees could decide to step aside from the foundation, though no decisions have been made yet. The transfer of stewardship has been met with scepticism in some quarters. The Labour MP, Chris Bryant, told the Guardian on Sunday that it was a “Russian ruse” and expressed fears that it was an attempt by Abramovich to avoid sanctions. One source suggested that Abramovich had been jolted into acting quickly when Bryant told Parliament last Thursday that the Russian was identified by the Home Office in 2019 as having links to the Russian state as well as to “corrupt activity and practices”. Chelsea have reportedly insisted that the transfer of power is not an attempt to avoid sanctions but rather to save the club from potential “reputational and strategic damage”. Legal experts have also questioned whether transferring stewardship amounts to anything given that Abramovich still owns Chelsea and, providing he is not sanctioned, can still fund the Stamford Bridge club. Sources have said that nothing has changed at Chelsea. Their charitable foundation is headed by Bruce Buck, the club’s chairman. The other trustees are Emma Hayes, the Chelsea Women’s manager; Piara Powar, the executive director of the anti-racism organisation Fare; Paul Ramos, Chelsea’s director of finance; the sports lawyer John Devine; Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics; and Hugh Robertson, the chairman of the British Olympic Association and a former MP and sports minister. Football decisions – including transfers, contracts and the future of the manager, Thomas Tuchel – will be the responsibility of the director Marina Granovskaia and the technical and performance director, Petr Cech. They are already heavily influential in running the club, and in practical terms little will change for now on a day-to-day basis. Abramovich’s move is likely to attract interest in Chelsea from potential bidders, although the club have said that they are not for sale. It is unclear if a sale would be possible if Abramovich is sanctioned. Chelsea have been approached for comment.",Sport/Football,Charity Commission requests more detail on Abramovich’s plans for Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/28/charity-commission-requests-more-information-abramovich-plan-chelsea
3/1/2022,"That definite article means it’s the genuine article. Adding “the” to Batman’s name has become a huge part of the brand identity, a sign of how elemental and atavistic this shadowy figure is supposed to be. You can imagine some growly voice saying “the Batman” – but not Tom Holland putting on a deep baritone to say he’s “the Spider-Man”, or Henry Cavill booming he’s “the Superman” (although maybe you could have Billy Joel stride into a dark Gotham City bar to raspingly confront “the Piano Man”). Director and co-writer Matt Reeves has created a new Batman iteration in which Robert Pattinson reinvents billionaire Bruce Wayne as an elegantly wasted rock star recluse, willowy and dandyish in his black suit with tendrils of dark hair falling over his face; but Wayne magically trebles in bulk when he reappears in costume and mask as the Dark Knight, his whole being weaponised into a slab-like impassivity. And this of course is happening in the sepulchral vastness of Gotham City, the brutal and murky world which Christopher Nolan thrillingly pioneered with his Dark Knight trilogy and made indispensable for imagining Batman on screen. Intriguingly at first, The Batman feels like a serial killer chiller such as Saw. For a time it promises a mystery plot relating to the theme of municipal corruption which is so important to the Batman franchise, and holds out hope of an unmasking with a satisfying narrative resolution. But not really. It is tremendously designed, visually spectacular with great set pieces and juddering, sternum-shivering impacts coming at you out of the darkness. There are unassumingly good performances from Jeffrey Wright and John Turturro, and Zoë Kravitz’s superpower is charisma. But the film is overlong; the Riddler’s puzzles aren’t particularly ingenious or even important to the story and there’s a pretty feeble non-ending which sheepishly sidesteps The Batman’s existential crisis. Gotham City’s political classes are complacently congratulating themselves on rooting out a major drug dealer, Sal Maroni. But the city is still drenched in crime and addiction to a new narcotic called “drops”, to which law enforcement is clearly turning a blind eye. Most exercised about this is the Riddler (Paul Dano), sporting a rubber gimp mask for his many social media appearances. He sets out to whack the corrupt Gotham establishment one by one, including Mayor Don Mitchell (Rupert Penry-Jones) and district attorney Gil Colson (Peter Sarsgaard), leaving quibbling questions for the Batman on Hallmark-type cards at the scene of each gruesome crime. So our antihero effectively joins forces with commissioner Gordon (Wright, lending his innate dignity and integrity to the role) to take down the Riddler, incidentally putting himself up against mob boss Carmine Falcone (Turturro) and his bloated sidekick Oswald “The Penguin” Cobblepot (Colin Farrell) who don’t like questions being asked about who is doing the corrupting. But wait. The Riddler is obsessed above all with what he says is the most grotesquely crooked thing about Gotham City: the plutocrat Wayne family and Bruce’s late father who made fraud and crime the city’s foundation stone. The Riddler longs to kill Bruce Wayne. And the Batman is beginning to wonder … could the Riddler have a point? The Batman has some people in his corner. Kravitz is stylish and assured as cat burglar Selina Kyle, or Catwoman, who has reasons of her own for detesting creepy Falcone. There is a nice sequence when Bruce gives Selina some surveillance contact lenses to wear before she sashays through Carmine’s club, making eye contact with the cringing regulars, while Wayne monitors it all on a screen. Andy Serkis plays Wayne’s butler Alfred, a loyal plain-speaking fellow who has apparently done time in the “circus”: meaning the John Le Carré intelligence world, not the actual circus, although it’s confusing given the Cirque du Soleil stylings all the combatants are going in for. But the ending is tiresome and shark-jumping in the extreme, with faux-apocalyptic scenes which work better in less solemn superhero adventures, and an exasperating non-revelation whose significance is teased for the next film. Inevitably, night falls on the latest Batman iteration with the cloudy sense that – of course – nothing has really been at stake. A classy turn from Pattinson, however, as the crime fighter with an injured soul.  The Batman is released on 3 March in Australia, and 4 March in the US and UK.",Arts/Film,The Batman review – Robert Pattinson’s emo hero elevates gloomy reboot,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/28/the-batman-review-robert-pattinson
3/1/2022,"Canadian researchers believe they have found the first-ever instance of a deer passing the coronavirus to a human, warning that broader surveillance of wildlife is needed to prevent further mutations from developing and spreading undetected. In a paper published last week, but not yet peer reviewed, scientists say at least one case of Covid-19 in humans can be traced to a strain of the virus found in hunted deer. Biologists have previously found white tail deer populations infected with Covid in northeastern regions of the United States, as well central provinces of Canada. While deer aren’t typically seen as a species that can easily pass on the virus to humans, experts had nonetheless speculated that transmission was possible. As part of their study, Canadian scientists took samples from hundreds of white tail deer hunted last fall in southwestern Ontario. After conducting nasal swabs and testing the lymph nodes of the deer, they found 17 of the 298 deer were positive for a “new and highly divergent lineage” of the coronavirus. The virus bears little resemblance to strains currently circulating in human populations. Instead, the closest genetic relative to the strain came from samples taken from humans and mink in Michigan two years ago, tweeted Finlay Maguire, an assistant professor at Dalhousie University and one of the paper’s authors. The researchers then compared the genetic makeup of coronavirus found in the deer to cases of the virus found in humans in the region. The team found one resident who had a strikingly similar strain of the virus and who had been in contact with deer. While the authors said limited sample data made it difficult to fully understand the genetic relationship between the strains, the timing and location of the infection suggested a deer was the likely source. Scientists aren’t sure how the deer contracted the virus initially, but further study of the variant circulating in the population suggested that its spike structure meant vaccine escape – the ability for virus to bypass vaccines – was unlikely. “It’s reassuring that we found no evidence of further transmission, during a time when we were doing a lot of sampling and a lot of sequencing,” Samira Mubareka, a microbiologist and clinical scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, told CBC News. “If we continue to do this surveillance, we’ll get a much better sense of what the actual risk is.” Experts have long worried that the virus could infect and then mutate within certain animals, known as reservoir species. After reviewing the genetic sequence of the virus, Canada’s public health agency said a there was no indication it had spread to humans and was likely an “isolated case”. “Until we know more, people who hunt, trap or work closely with or handle wildlife should take precautions to prevent the potential spread of the virus,” the agency said on its website.",News/World news,Possible case of deer-to human Covid infection identified in Canada,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/deer-human-covid-transmission-possible-canada
3/1/2022,"Switzerland, a bastion of neutrality through two world wars, has decided to adopt wholesale swingeing EU sanctions against the Russian central bank, freezing as much as billions of dollars in assets and massively increasing the pressure on the Russian economy. The government also announced it had banned five oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin from entering the country. Flights from Russia are being banned, although this will not apply to flights carrying diplomats. Switzerland had until now adopted limited measures, including barring Swiss companies from taking on new business with three Russian oligarchs named by the EU as sanctions targets last week. Switzerland is obliged by law to adopt UN sanctions but has a choice over how it responds to EU measures. It is not imposing a ban on commodity trading. Nearly 80% of Russian commodity trading takes place virtually via financial service centres in Switzerland. Russian energy and raw materials groups such as Gazprom and Russian state banks have major branches in Switzerland. The new steps are qualitatively different to anything Switzerland has done previously to shackle Russia, partly because the measures adopted by the EU are so sweeping. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Swiss-based global financial umbrella body nicknamed the “bank for central banks”, has said it will not be an avenue for any circumvention of western sanctions placed on Russia for invading Ukraine. More than 20,000 people marched though Berne on Sunday in protest at the invasion, and the Swiss socialist party had urged the executive Federal Council to take stronger measures. Last week the Swiss president, Ignazio Cassis, condemned Russian aggression in a strongly worded statement, but he has been trying to balance calls for sanctions with the country’s traditional commitment to neutrality. Formally, the measures do not undermine that widely supported neutrality principle, as Switzerland says it is acting in defence of international law, but Moscow is hardly likely to accept that explanation. Switzerland did not adopt the EU’s sanctions in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, citing the work it was doing through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to help bring about a ceasefire. Germany and Sweden have similarly found longstanding political shibboleths challenged by Russia’s actions. Switzerland, alongside London, is probably the single biggest home for Russian oligarchs seeking to house their cash. Attracted to the country’s strict banking secrecy laws, Russians held nearly 10.4bn Swiss francs ($11.24bn) in Switzerland in 2020, Swiss National Bank data shows. The government said on Friday that financial “intermediaries” in Switzerland were now banned from starting new business relationships with 363 Russian people and four Russian companies. Any existing business must be reported to the Swiss economic affairs secretariat. Further steps are under consideration. The Swiss embassy in Moscow reported last year that “Switzerland has for years been by far the most important destination worldwide for rich Russians to manage their wealth,” and that net transfers by Russian taxpayers to Switzerland totalled $2.5bn in 2020. The Swiss government represents the interests of the former Soviet republic of Georgia in Moscow and Russia’s interests in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, under an arrangement set up after those two countries broke off bilateral ties during their conflict in 2008. On Sunday the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked his Swiss counterpart to act as a neutral mediator between Ukraine and Russia and help work towards a ceasefire, notably in the context of a Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva opening on Monday.",News/World news,Switzerland adopts wholesale EU sanctions against Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/switzerland-adopts-wholesale-eu-sanctions-against-russia
3/1/2022,"An American TikToker has sent sales of an obscure Canadian poetry collection soaring, after she had a dream that led her to track down the title. TikToker Ohmarni, whose real name is Marni Webb, posted a video about a “rare book that I dreamt about” on 31 December. In her dream Webb, who claims to be psychic, was asked by a man “is the fifth window open?” Googling this led her to Canadian poet Russell Thornton’s collection The Fifth Window, published in 2000 – but it was hard to get hold of, and only available when requested from university libraries. “Now explain to me, why is a book about the psychic world and the real world meeting in the reserves/request section, like super locked up tight? That’s weird, that’s suspicious,” she said in her video, which has now been viewed more than 3m times. Thornton found out about his unexpected viral fame when he was emailed by Vancouver poet Rob Taylor. “I’m not on TikTok, I’ve heard the words, but I had no idea what it was all about,” Thornton told CBC. “My 13-year-old daughter was home and I said: ‘Do you know anything about TikTok?’” Thornton sent Webb one of his two remaining copies of the collection – and she went on to post further Tiktok videos about the title, saying that she had dreamed about two of Thornton’s poems in the book 10 years ago. “These divine coincidences are wild,” she said, in a video that has been viewed tens of thousands of times. Orders have since flooded in to Thornton’s publisher, and the independent Saskatoon-based Thistledown Press has now ordered a reprint of the title, which draws from the landscape of Vancouver and the British Columbia coast to create “an ecstatic vision in which the psyche and natural world meet and become one”. “At 3.2m views, the video has inspired thousands to search for the book and eventually find Thistledown Press,” said the publisher. “The response has been huge, with orders coming in not only from across Canada but from 33 US states and countries as far away as Ireland, Norway, Australia, Germany, Bulgaria and Bermuda. Not bad for a poetry book published by an indie Saskatoon publisher.” Thornton told CBC that at first he thought the situation was a prank, and “then I just thought it was comical. I thought it was funny as hell,” he said. “It’s so hard to get any attention for any book of poetry in Canada. So I was kind of pleasantly surprised and pleased by the fact that maybe this will get some attention on that book.” Thornton, who lives in North Vancouver, is also the author of the Griffin Poetry prize-shortlisted collection The Hundred Lives, and most recently the collection Answer to Blue – a response to DH Lawrence’s question, “Oh what in you can answer to this blueness?”",Arts/Books,Obscure poetry collection’s sales soar after TikToker dreams about it,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/28/tiktok-poetry-the-fifth-window-russell-thornton

In decades to come, when the nuclear winter ends and the handful of survivors who survive whatever horrors are about to be visited upon us by Mad Vlad emerge blinking into the apocalyptic landscape, the dusty, radioactive old record books may show that Sunday’s Sickly Sweet Energy Drink Cup finished scoreless after 120 minutes, but they will offer few clues as to just how thrilling an encounter it was. Having scored three disallowed goals to Liverpool’s one, it could be argued the best team lost and Tommy T could scarcely have sounded more pleased with his beaten Chelsea team. Having spoken so eloquently before the game about the difficult position in which he and his players find themselves at a club that has acknowledged but not condemned what they described as “the situation” in Ukraine, Tuchel was surprisingly upbeat considering how spectacularly the old goalkeeper-switcheroo tactical masterstroke with which he hoped to win a nerve-shredding penalty shoot-out blew up in his face. “I’m proud of the team,” he said. “It was an excellent performance. We could have won it, they could have won it. It was such a tight game. Even the penalties were full of quality.” Well, most of the penalties. Prior to joining his players for some post-match dressing-room dad-dancing to the mellifluous tones of Gala’s Freed From Desire, Jürgen Klopp spoke about his own goalkeeper, a young Irishman who doesn’t often feature for Liverpool, but has made enough of an impression on the rare occasions he does to have British broadcasters finally pronouncing his name properly. “Even in professional football, I think there should be some space for sentiment,” he said of his decision to start Caoimhín Kelleher in the final. “I am two things, a professional football manager and a human being. And the human being won this time. That is why it was so nice.” And who could argue? After a weekend in which Leeds shot Bambi’s mum and the world inched ever closer to Armageddon, who among us couldn’t do with a little bit more “nice” in our lives. “I am so sorry for him.

3/1/2022,"The Nigerian government has condemned the treatment of thousands of its students and citizens fleeing the war in Ukraine, amid growing concerns that African students are being discriminated by security officials and denied entry into Poland. A deluge of reports and footage posted on social media in the past week has shown acts of discrimination and violence against African, Asian and Caribbean citizens – many of them studying in Ukraine – while fleeing Ukrainian cities and at some of the country’s border posts. They are among several hundreds of thousands of people trying to escape the country as civilian casualties and destruction mount. More than half a million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion last week, according to the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR. The Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, said on Monday: “All who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under UN convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference,” citing reports that Ukrainian police had obstructed Nigerians. “From video evidence, first-hand reports, and from those in contact with ... Nigerian consular officials, there have been unfortunate reports of Ukrainian police and security personnel refusing to allow Nigerians to board buses and trains heading towards Ukraine-Poland border,” he said. “One group of Nigerian students having been repeatedly refused entry into Poland have concluded they have no choice but to travel again across Ukraine and attempt to exit the country via the border with Hungary.” Nigeria’s special adviser to the president on diaspora affairs, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, said: “Africans are being denied entry through the Ukrainian borders. The minister of foreign affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, has taken this up with the Ukrainian ambassador. Our people who want to leave must be allowed to.” Amid chaotic and emotional scenes at Ukraine’s borders with Poland, as well as Romania and Belarus, where a number of African governments have advised citizens to head to, the treatment of African and Asian people has caused outrage. ManyAfrican students have condemned the difficulties they have faced trying to escape the conflict, reporting hostility from security forces, ordinary Ukrainians and border staff. Samuel George, a 22-year-old Nigerian software engineering student, drove from Kyiv, along with four of his friends, fellow students from Nigeria and South Africa, to the Polish border. Queues of cars full of people trying to leave spanned 31 miles (50km) to the border. Yet when some men who were in the queue noticed they were Africans, he said, they stopped their vehicle. “They immediately saw that the Ukrainians could pass but when they realised we weren’t Ukrainians they stopped it. They told us we couldn’t move forward and wouldn’t let us join the queue,” George said. When they tried to defy them, he said the men attacked and vandalised their windscreen. “They demanded $500 – we begged and negotiated to pay $100. We had to leave the car and trek. We were walking for almost five hours to the border with Poland. One of us was sick. The temperature was freezing, it was so tough.” At the border, Ukrainian officials “showed racist acts”, attempting to force them to the back of the queue, George said. “So many of us are still stuck there facing challenges. Some of them went to the borders but they were sent back and are still trying to leave.” Emily*, a 24-year-old medical student from Kenya, said she spent hours waiting for Ukrainian border guards to let her enter Poland because they were prioritising Ukrainian nationals. “We had to wait five hours but we were lucky: we met some people there who had spent days waiting in the foreign national queue,” she said. After eventually entering Poland she boarded a free bus, organised by an NGO, to a hotel near Warsaw that was offering free board to Ukrainian refugees. However, the hotel refused to take her and her Kenyan friends in after examining their documents. “The staff said, ‘Sorry, we can’t admit you because this was meant only for Ukrainians,” she said. The hotel also refused to give Emily a room after she offered to pay for one. Instead, Emily’s family in Kenya got in touch with a Polish acquaintance, who was able to find accommodation for Emily and other students with friends in Warsaw. In footage posted on social media, men identified by students as Ukrainians were seen abusing and assaulting them near borders, preventing them from leaving. We have reached the actual border experiencing some threats of violence from some local Ukrainians who don’t believe we should enter. This man keeps circling our car pic.twitter.com/kWw5DjkcL0 In response to calls for information and advice for students worried about leaving Ukraine, several support groups have been set up on WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook by people advocating for more assistance and by students who have been trying to leave. Government officials from Ukraine and Poland have said all refugees are welcome, adding that border officials were working through hundreds of thousands of cases. In the weeks leading up to the war it was clear that increased support was needed but the government did not act, Samuel said, condemning what he described as a lack of quick and concise assistance from Nigerian authorities. Days after Ukraine closed its airspace to civilian flights, Nigerian lawmakers and ministers attempted to organise evacuation flights before changing plans. One student said they tried to contact the consulate but failed to reach an official. “I don’t see how in a situation like this, where the citizens are in a country where there is war, that a country won’t do everything to rescue their citizens, but that is where we are,” they said. “The whole situation is tragic, the war is so tragic. So many men were staying behind to fight with the army. I was seeing so many greeting their wives and families farewell. It felt like the world was coming to an end.”",News/World news,Nigeria condemns treatment of Africans trying to flee Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/nigeria-condemns-treatment-africans-trying-to-flee-ukraine-government-poland-discrimination
3/1/2022,"Derek Jeter is stepping away from his role as CEO of the Miami Marlins after four seasons with the team. “Today I am announcing that the Miami Marlins and I are officially ending our relationship and I will no longer serve as CEO nor as a shareholder in the Club,” the former New York Yankees star said in a statement on Monday. “We had a vision five years ago to turn the Marlins franchise around, and as CEO, I have been proud to put my name and reputation on the line to make our plan a reality. Through hard work, trust and accountability, we transformed every aspect of the franchise, reshaping the workforce, and developing a long-term strategic plan for success. “That said, the vision for the future of the franchise is different than the one I signed up to lead. Now is the right time for me to step aside as a new season begins.” Jeter was part of the group that bought the Marlins in August 2017 for $1.2bn. The 47-year-old owned 4% of the franchise and oversaw baseball operations at the club. The Marlins reached the playoffs in the pandemic shortened 2020 season, but that was the only year they had a winning record during Jeter’s time at the club. In total they have only had one winning season since 2010 and are regularly at the bottom of MLB’s home attendance rankings. All the Marlins baseball ops people were hastily called to a Zoom meetng where Bruce Sherman broke the news on Derek Jeter's departure. There's a strong feeling through the organization that Kim Ng has significant authority, building on the respect she has built on every level. It is believed Kim Ng, the only female general manager in MLB, will now assume many of Jeter’s responsibilities. Jeter was elected to the baseball hall of fame in 2020 after a sparkling career with the Yankees, during which he won five World Series and was named an All-Star 15 times.",Sport/Sport,Derek Jeter steps down as Marlins CEO as club’s decade-long doldrum continues,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/28/derek-jeter-steps-down-as-marlins-ceo-as-clubs-decade-long-doldrum-continues
3/1/2022,"Dozens of people in Kharkiv have been killed and hundreds wounded in rocket strikes by Russian forces on Monday morning, the Ukrainian interior ministry has said. Nika, a teacher in Kharkiv, describes the situation the city’s residents find themselves in: “A few hours ago, they started bombarding a residential neighbourhood with rockets. Then they started bombarding another large residential neighbourhood in another part of the city. “They stopped about a couple of hours ago. We don’t know which neighbourhood may be next. We [eat meals] wearing our jackets, so we are ready to run into a shelter any second. “When the neighbourhoods were being hit, we could hear the rockets loudly but our walls were not shaking. We say that if our walls are shaking then we will run to the basement, but so far today, thank God, our walls have not shaken. “We’re relatively far from these neighbourhoods but we can hear [the attacks]. We’re getting information from local Telegram chats and friends in the areas. “For our friends in these neighbourhoods, it was obviously horrifying. Many of them sleep in the basement. Some of them don’t have electricity or heating. The windows are broken in many buildings. “Two nights ago was really horrible, it was even more terrifying than the first night when the war started. We woke up at 12.30am and I cannot even describe the sound we heard. I was lying in my bed thinking that it sounds like Star Wars – I cannot even describe how horrifying the sounds of these explosions or rockets or shelling or planes were. “Like all other citizens of my city, I woke up on Thursday at around 5am from hearing explosions. And immediately, we understood that our worst expectations had become a terrible reality. [For the] first hours it was very hard to accept it. Not only mentally, but also physically. My body was refusing to accept the danger in which it was in. I was shaking, I wanted to vomit. “We decided not to leave the city because of the traffic, but we moved to another neighbourhood to stay with friends. We are still lucky because we still have electricity, hot water and internet connection. “We try not to panic, we try to think logically that if we hear something that is really close, the basement is five metres away, so we will have time to run. We try to calm ourselves with this kind of logical thinking. “Of course we are scared. I think my parents, they’re not as scared as I am, but I’m very scared of losing my life. I’m very scared I will be killed in this war. But despite that we are very, very angry and the feeling of hatred is just palpable. We just want to win this war. “We also feel extremely proud of our army, the way they fight, the way they protect us. It’s so inspiring. And I think our army is the only [thing] that helps me to keep having faith and believe that everything is going to be all right. “I think the feelings that we feel right now are anger and proudness, and of course some fear, but also a lot of hope.” If you are affected by the situation in Ukraine, you can share your story here.",News/World news,‘I’m scared I’ll die in this war’: Kharkiv teacher on life under Russian attack,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/kharkiv-teacher-life-under-russia-attack-ukraine
3/1/2022,"At least seven people have been killed and 44 injured after Russian forces launched multiple rocket strikes on the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in what appeared to mark a change in tactics by Moscow towards bombing civilian areas. Video showed dozens of Grad missiles raining down on the centre of Ukraine’s second biggest city, landing among residential buildings. One resident described the attack as “horrendous” and the worst yet, following five days of remorseless bombardment and Russia’s invasion. The attack came despite a call between the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Vladimir Putin in which, according to the Elysée palace, the Russian president had said he was “willing to commit” to ending attacks on civilians and civil civilian infrastructure while peace talks in Belarus were under way. Gruesome video footage showed the aftermath of one strike on the city’s central Klochkivska Street. A Grad missile landed outside number 197, blowing the leg off a woman who had gone shopping during a break in the curfew. She died soon afterwards. “My brother’s colleague lives in the street. She saw what happened and heard the sound of the rocket. When she looked out from her balcony she saw the woman lying in agony, her leg blown off and to one side,” Artem Volodymyrovich, a 31-year-old English teacher, said. The colleague – who declined to be named – took a photo from her balcony. It shows a patch of blood and the motor part of a Grad missile sticking out of the concrete pavement. A few stunned onlookers were taking pictures on their phones. Other video footage filmed on Monday shows a series of Russian missiles pulverising the centre of Kharkiv, apparently fired by a multiple rocket launcher system (MRLA). Flames, smoke and dust rise in a line into the sky. At least five civilians and two soldiers were killed in Kharkiv, the Kyiv Independent newspaper reported, with 22 civilians and 20 soldiers injured. Ukraine’s interior ministry put the figure higher and said dozens had died in the attack, with hundreds injured. The unprecedented onslaught may be retaliation for the events of Sunday, when Ukrainian forces repelled a move by Russian light armoured vehicles to enter and seize the city. Its governor, Oleh Sinegubov, said Kharkiv was under Kyiv’s control – something residents confirmed. Volodymyrovich said he ventured out into the streets on Monday afternoon and walked with his brother to the railway station. The situation had worsened, he said: “Bombing has been going on from morning to evening. It’s horrendous, just horrible.” “I heard Grads. It’s different from machine gun fire which we have got used to and can identify. There are tank tracks on the asphalt on both sides of the road.” More rockets landed near the 23 August metro station, just north of the centre, he said, He explained that he was now fleeing the city on a packed train heading to the west. “I don’t know if my train will arrive,” he said. “I’m with lots of foreigners from India and Pakistan. It’s free. There are no tickets and we are crowded in a carriage.” Ukraine’s former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk said Russia was now using multiple rocket launcher systems to target civilian infrastructure. Grad attacks were taking place in Kyiv and Mariupol, he said, amid Kremlin frustration that a military breakthrough had not yet been achieved. “We expect Russia will adapt its tactics without changing strategic plans. That may include missiles and airstrikes on the entire depth of Ukraine,” he said. He added: “In addition it is expected to move from the ‘accidental’ destruction of civilian objects (kindergartens, hospitals, apartment buildings) to planned and targeted terrorist activities to target civilian infrastructure. The aim is to create panic and to force capitulation.” Kharkiv is a Russian-speaking city and home to 1.4 million people. Vladimir Putin claimed to be protecting Russian speakers when he launched his “special operation” in Ukraine last week – a claim belied by the blatant shelling of residential areas. “This is the protection of the Russian-speaking population? We will never forgive Russia for all these deaths,” Kristina Berdynskykh, one of Ukraine’s top journalists, tweeted on Monday. Харьков - русскоязычный город Украины.

The strategic port city of Mariupol was “hanging on”, according to Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Residents said the eastern port city on the Sea of Azov was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy fire. “We hear planes in the sky. It’s overcast. We can’t tell whether there are ours or Russians’,” Anatoliy Lozar said, speaking from a basement where he was sheltering with his family. Lozar said he was helping evacuate civilians following another night of heavy bombardment. He said Russian warplanes had bombed the village of Shyrokyne, 12 miles (20km) west of Mariupol, with Ukrainian soldiers wounded. The village on the frontline with the self-proclaimed separatist Donetsk people’s republic was still under Ukrainian control, he said. He added: “We have become the new Stalingrad. We are killing Russians. Some have been taken prisoner. Families are hiding in basements. They are terrified. Huge numbers of volunteers have been joining the army. We have weapons. We will fight to the last.” Lozar said attempts had been made to evacuate the wounded by helicopters, which has come under Russian fire. He said some Russian diversionary groups had rented apartments inside the city ahead of the invasion and had been plotting attacks. Despite a slow start to its five-day military offensive, and fierce Ukrainian resistance, Russia was getting closer to its strategic goal of capturing the 150 miles strip along the Sea of Azov, between the Crimean peninsula and Mariupol. On Sunday Russian military vehicles rolled into Berdyansk, a small port city of around 100,000 people. Soldiers took over the city’s administration building. Crowds gathered outside to protest and sang the Ukrainian national anthem. They also chanted: “Putin is a dick.” ""Putin is a dickhead! Putin is a dickhead!""

3/1/2022,"Had it been released at any point in the past few years, Chernobyl: The Lost Tapes would have been an important documentary; a feature-length blend of audio interviews and largely unseen archive footage that puts the 1986 disaster into horrifying new perspective. That it comes out now – just days after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including an attack on the Chernobyl site itself – makes it as unmissable as it is harrowing. Obviously, this timeliness was never the intention. Indeed, the film-maker James Jones had a different historical event in mind when he started work on it two years ago. “I initially thought the relevance was Covid,” he says. Like Chernobyl, the early days of the pandemic were marked with mysterious illnesses that the local government attempted to keep a lid on. “I was interested in the idea that this invisible enemy was threatening us,” he says. “An authoritarian regime was lying about it, and Chinese citizens were starting to voice their disquiet publicly.” The seed of the documentary was planted when Jones read two books on the disaster during lockdown – “Not good for my mental state,” he says in retrospect. “But completely fascinating.” One contained a footnote that caught his eye. “It referenced footage that was shot in Pripyat [in northern Ukraine] the weekend after the accident,” he says. Despite the fact that the worst nuclear disaster in history had happened down the road hours earlier, releasing 400 times more radioactive material into the atmosphere than the Hiroshima bomb, the footage showed residents milling about as if nothing had happened. “You can see mothers pushing babies around and kids playing football in the sand,” says Jones. “Then you start to see these white flashes on the film because of the insanely high level of radiation. It was so chilling.” Nevertheless, the existence of this footage spurred him to seek out more. Via a wealth of sources – national archives, propaganda films, collapsed Soviet documentary studios, western news reports, children and soldiers who happened to have video cameras at the time – he began to piece together a blistering documentary that draws a straight line from the USSR’s attempts to play down the disaster to the fall of the Soviet Union itself. Although Chernobyl is one of those historical punctuation points on which everyone thinks they have a decent overview, not least due to Sky’s recent drama series, The Lost Tapes is studded with moments of footage so extraordinary that you are unlikely to forget them. A clean-up helicopter crashing to the ground over the explosion site. Searing footage of injuries and mutations to humans and animals. Wooden grave markers in an irradiated forest. But perhaps the most unforgettable sequence is of the so-called liquidators; civil and military personnel who, after the robot designed to do the job became overloaded with radiation and malfunctioned, were tasked with clearing tons of contaminated material from the roof of the building by hand. We see them fashioning rudimentary PPE by tying lead sheets to their bodies, and joking nervously about vodka. Then there is one clip where a camera follows a group of liquidators up a ladder and out on to the roof itself. It is absolutely extraordinary, like being led by the hand into the mouth of hell. “It was the most dangerous place on Earth at the time,” Jones says. “Many of them had no idea what they were doing.” Equally distressing is the footage shot around Pripyat before the disaster. The place looks like a utopia. It’s clean and open, filled with so many children that a government official proudly opens the new wing of a maternity ward to cope with capacity. Jones admits that this footage has an air of Soviet propaganda to it, but it does seem a largely accurate reflection of how people who lived there felt about their town. “It just humanised the place,” says Jones of this footage. “I loved the drama series, but it is relentlessly grim. I think the only shot you see of the actual town is when a bird falls from the sky and dies. But this whole other reality existed, of people swimming in the sea and having ordinary lives. So when the tragedy does hit, you feel that this wasn’t the distant world of grim Soviet citizens. It was a lively and joyous place.” One thread the documentary does share with the series, though, is Lyudmilla Ignatenko. Played by Jessie Buckley in the drama, she is a Ukrainian, pregnant at the time of the accident, whose husband died of severe radiation poisoning after trying to put out the blaze. Ignatenko is one of the primary interviewees in The Lost Tapes. She displays similar emotional backbone here, providing an audio recollection of the horror she witnessed with remarkable clearheadedness. “Lyudmilla has been through so much tragedy,” says Jones, awestruck. Some of the more homespun archive footage also helps remind us how relatively recent the disaster was. To watch the uniformed cast of the Chernobyl series – or any official Soviet footage from that time, much of which was still shot on black and white film to save upgrading their kit – you could be lulled into thinking all this took place in the 1950s or 60s. But Jones’s wealth of new video footage, with some startlingly era-appropriate fashion, helps to underline that in terms of history, this happened very recently. “It feels properly 80s,” says Jones. “Actually there was a great clip I really wanted to use where there’s a really 80s disco, and just like flashing lights and DJs and stuff. But it felt slightly wrong tonally to include it.” For all the visceral horror of Chernobyl: The Lost Tapes, the thing that drags the film into the now is the torrent of disinformation that gushed out of the USSR in the wake of the tragedy. Despite the rest of the world reacting with justified alarm at the threat to life, the Soviet government clamped shut and refused to acknowledge anything that wasn’t fully undeniable, regardless of evidence. Pripyat residents are evacuated, but told they will return in a matter of days. Patients dying of unimaginable radiation burns were brushed away as having no connection to Chernobyl. The documentary claims that 200,000 people are estimated to have died as a direct result of the disaster. The official Soviet tally remains at 13. To put it in modern terms, this was fake news on a colossal scale. Eventually, people learned the truth and public anger at the cover-up was such that Ukrainian independence soon followed, as did the final collapse of the USSR. I ask Jones whether, in the age of the internet, something so big could be covered as easily. “You would think it would be impossible but then you look at Russia, at eastern Ukraine. If people are watching state television, particularly people at a certain age, you really can control what people think. I guess Putin’s tactic now is just to sow confusion everywhere so people feel they can’t trust anything, whether it’s state TV or some conspiracy theory on Facebook. The actual truth is just one of many things running around. You’d like to think that, if people were dying from radiation or getting cancer or their hair was falling out, that it would be documented. But I don’t know. My faith in the modern world has been shaken.” Securing all the footage was such an arduous job that it took him right up to the wire. “It was scattered around Russia and Ukraine, and it was just a nightmare,” he says. “Soviet bureaucracy, the pandemic, sanctions. Our payments to Russia kept getting stopped by banks. It was laughable. Until two or three weeks ago, I thought there was no way we could deliver on time.” The documentary was finally handed in a week ago. “Literally in the nick of time,” says Jones. “If the war had started earlier, the film wouldn’t have been finished.” That brings us to the subject that has cast a shadow over the interview, the documentary, and the world at large. Throughout our talk, Jones has spoken adoringly of his Ukrainian producers who helped to hunt down the archive footage, along with the crew and interview subjects from the area. Have they been in touch since the invasion? “Pretty much all of them, yeah,” he replies. How are they doing? “They are all terrified, you know? Angry. They are all feeling pretty helpless.” And Lyudmilla Ignatenko? “I texted yesterday saying, you know, I hope you’re OK. I always talk to her in Russian when we text,” he says. “This time, she replied in Ukrainian.”  Chernobyl: The Lost Tapes is on Sky Documentaries tonight at 9pm.",Arts/Television & radio,Chernobyl: The Lost Tapes – stunning TV that is suddenly unmissable,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/28/chernobyl-the-lost-tapes-stunning-tv-that-is-suddenly-unmissable
3/1/2022,"It was August 2015, we were on our first tour of Europe, and it was our last show, so we were all absolutely destroyed. We were playing this little town called Znojmo in the Moravian region of the Czech Republic, which is incredibly beautiful. We were playing in the courtyard of a cathedral from the 12th century and it was right in the centre of the old town. We had to get a security escort in there just to park the van, which was a Volkswagen. We’d had a massive night the night before. Everything was a little out of control. There were these punters playing this game where they were spitting water in each other’s faces, and they spat water in one of the band member’s faces. So he took his drink and spat it in her face, but his drink was orange juice and vodka, which burned her eyes, and she went bananas at him – “Why did you do that to me?!” The next day we woke up and were running late for this last show at Znojmo. Kat [Mear], our violinist, was up the front of the van vomiting into a large McDonald’s cup, pouring it out the passenger-side window as we were driving down the highway. Later, we got to a petrol station and the drummer, Rene [Mancuso], came up to me and said, “I’ve got to show you something” – a huge gouge out of the wall of the tyre on the front passenger side of the van. It was so dangerous, it could have blown out at any moment. We looked underneath, there was no spare tyre and we had to get to this gig. We’d told the car hire place in Germany that we weren’t going to the Czech Republic. For some reason, they specifically asked if we were going there, so of course we flat-out lied and went to the Czech Republic. So we couldn’t really call them from the Czech Republic, could we? It was already the second van we got off them, because the air conditioning in the first one broke down. In hindsight, I don’t think we needed to lie, but fuck, we didn’t know what we were doing – we just thought, if anyone asks any questions, don’t give away any information at all! So, we got to the gig, and everybody fell out of the van. Kat the violinist was lying there in a heap with her head in her hands. The festival booker thought there was no way we were going to be able to get it together. But the show was incredible! The town church bells rang halfway through, and it turned out the church bells were in C, and when they rang they actually were in key with the music. It was magical. The next day we had to get the van back to Frankfurt, which was hours away, and the van wasn’t safe to drive. It was a Sunday, everything was closed, and half the band was flying out the next morning. A friend of one of the guys managed to get through to the only tyre place in town, and they didn’t have the right tyre, but the guy who made the call suggested that we take the tyre off his mum’s van, which was a Renault. It turned out it was the wrong size – it was a completely different tyre – but it did fit the rim. So we swapped them over, paid this guy some money so he could get a new tyre for his mum, and drove our van to Frankfurt with it pulling to one side the whole time because the tyre was the wrong size. We returned the van without saying a word, got on a plane and flew out of the country. We never heard another thing about it.

3/1/2022,"Record flooding across northern NSW will force Lismore shire council to rework its new flood management strategy even before it is implemented, and other regions will probably follow suit as insurers tally the cost of worsening climate extremes. Lismore mayor Steve Krieg, just 10 weeks into the role, says his town is struggling to cope with hundreds of emergency calls. He says the council will need to revisit plans to lift the area’s levee banks after the Wilsons River peaked on Monday afternoon at 14.4m, topping the previous records by two metres. “I think we’re going to have to redo a lot of things,” Krieg said. “There were a lot of decisions made in the past that probably weren’t in the best interest of the city as a whole. “In the coming weeks and months, we will be definitely implementing a much stronger and a much sturdier floodplain management strategy,” he said, adding that the priority for the moment was “all about saving lives”. Large areas of south-eastern Queensland, including parts of Brisbane, were busy assessing damage from days of heavy rain and severe flooding. That weather system, dubbed a “rain bomb”, shifted south into northern NSW bringing record flooding to Lismore and other towns, and parts of Sydney may be exposed to floods within days. Dunoon, a village near Lismore and Australia’s self-proclaimed macadamia capital, collected 775mm of rain in the 24 hours to 9am Monday, the second-highest daily total on record for NSW, Weatherzone meteorologist Ben Domensino said. NSW's Wilson River at Lismore remains near its record peak level above 14m. @BOM_NSW pic.twitter.com/06I3tqu6gb The Insurance Council of Australia on Monday said almost 15,000 insurance claims had already been lodged. It also extended the area declared an insurance catastrophe from south-east Queensland into northern NSW to help prioritise claims handling. The deluge and flooding prompted the council to suspend a campaign launched a week ago to encourage the winner of this year’s federal election to spend more on building resilience to severe weather events, which are only predicted to worsen as the climate heats up. “Unfortunately, the extreme weather being experienced in Queensland and New South Wales is a sombre reminder of why governments need to do more to better protect communities from the impacts of these events,” Andrew Hall, the council’s chief executive, told Guardian Australia. “That’s why we called for the federal government to double funding in measures that better protect homes and communities to $200m per year, and for this to be matched by the states and territories.” Among theInsurance Council’s recommendations to make Australia more resilient was a $522m local infrastructure fund for projects such as flood levees to defend regional towns. It also recommended a program to better protect homes against flooding and an improved national flood warning system to increase the lead time for warnings from three to five days to 10 to 15 days. Andrew Gissing, general manager of consulting firm Risk Frontiers, said that a warming atmosphere holds more moisture – at the rate of 1% per degree of heating – bringing the potential for more intense rainfall. “So that’ll have an impact on the frequency of flooding in the future,” Gissing said. “Rising sea levels will increase flooding in estuarine areas as well.” Flood damage is expected to increase in the coming days, with rivers such as the Clarence still rising, putting at risk Grafton and other towns. Further south, WaterNSW was predicting Sydney’s Warragamba Dam would start spilling later this week as heavy rains tops up a reservoir already near capacity. The Bureau of Meteorology forecasts Sydney will be soaked with 40-70mm of rainfall on Tuesday, 60-90mm on Wednesday and 20-35mm on Thursday. Inland regions, such as Warragamba, are not expected to get as much rain as coastal areas but falls will be enough to have multiple dams spilling, WaterNSW said. Gissing said it may take a week or longer for floodwaters to drain off and the full extent of the damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure to be known. He noted that Lismore’s new flood plan had only envisaged lifting the levee protecting the CBD to cope with a once in 20-year flood, rather than the historic flood that has devastated the town. To cope with a flood like the current one, the levee “would actually have to be pretty enormous”, Gissing said. “Whether or not that would actually be physically possible or actually acceptable to the community [is the question].” The fact the flooding at Lismore is unprecedented doesn’t mean it should not have been predicted, he said, adding that engineering increasingly takes into account the scale of potential flooding in a catchment, not just the historical record. And climate change means those predictions will need refining as climate models improve. “We know that heavy rain’s more likely in the future, and that our sea levels are going to rise further, which means coastal flooding is going to be an even bigger problem, and we continue to want to develop on flood-prone land” Gissing said. “So we’re continuing to increase the level of exposure that our communities have to flooding.”",News/Business,Australian insurers inundated with flood damage claims as Lismore rethinks risk management plan,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/28/australian-insurers-inundated-with-flood-damage-claims-as-lismore-rethinks-risk-management-plan
3/1/2022,"Omar Sakr’s foray into fiction began with him doing his own thing. “One of the first pieces of advice I got from an older writer some years ago was don’t publish your first novel because it’s going to be autobiographical, you can’t help it,” he says. “But rather than not publish the first novel, rather than being afraid of the idea of autobiography, I just thought I would run toward it and really own it.” The bisexual Turkish-Lebanese Muslim poet has explored the multiplicity of his identity in literary publications, anthologies and his own poetry collections: These Wild Houses, and the Prime Minister’s Literary award-winning The Lost Arabs. But it is in his debut novel Son of Sin that he really leans into his lived experience growing up queer and Muslim in a broken family in western Sydney. The result is an unflinchingly honest, vivid and intense work, spanning a young man’s formative years and the pain and pleasure that comes with negotiating – and breaking – rules around family, faith, culture and desire. Sakr writes lyrically and pointedly, exploring the impact of migration, racism, class and abuse on the lives of western Sydney families, and the younger generations coming to terms with who they are as they navigate circumstances well beyond their control. For Sakr and his peers, this was their parents’ illiteracy and its corresponding poverty; a recurring and threatening police presence; and gendered biases and homophobia. Sakr leaned into it truthfully; for instance, the emails that main character Jamal receives back from his father after coming out are slightly edited replicas of emails Sakr received from Turkey from his own father, who has since passed away. The process was not without pain, but enabled the author to really “savour [life] from the position [he’s] now in as a stable independent adult”. “A lot of what I experienced was terrifying and traumatising, not because it was violent, but because I lacked the information to contextualise what was going on and to understand the forces that were playing out in the lives of everyone around me,” he says. “So revisiting it now, many years later, I am able to see my family clearly, I am able to love them more deeply, and I’m also able to be more forgiving toward myself. Up until writing this book, I still had a lot of self-loathing, judgmental thoughts about all the things I should have done and said, and all the ways I saw myself as having failed as a son, as a brother, as a nephew and so on.” It’s difficult, as a reader, to see exactly how Jamal, son of an absent father and a drug-dependent mother, might have failed. Like most young men his age, he’s just trying to make sense of a life that he’s emotionally ill-equipped to deal with. Complicating things further are his same-sex desires, fraught in an environment that is deeply homophobic. After having sex with Bilal, another boy in the community, Jamal notes that Bilal is “comfortable and confident” not coming out – acquiescent even to his father, who has a bride in mind for his son. It’s a delicate exploration of the ways in which those from traditional communities must strategise around their queerness in order to live; of the reasons why some might never come out at all. “What Bilal says to Jamal is, ‘Come out to what?’” Sakr explains. “Where is the community for him to come out into? Where’s that queer Arab community? Where’s that queer Muslim community? Where’s he going to go? There’s nothing there. Family is everything to us, and it matters so much, and we’re not willing to just go ‘fuck ‘em’, and go live by ourselves. Anglo queers [can say] ‘I am going to go over here and live my best life and if you don’t want to be a part of it, well, bye’. “Many people in our community choose the opposite. That sense of duty, of love, is so powerful. And maybe it’s because we understand how much our family needs us. There’s an economic disparity too, so the power dynamics are very different. Our parents don’t have super; they have kids. And the kids are meant to take care of them, that’s the retirement plan.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning  The correlation of queerness with femininity is another uphill battle in these communities. Of coming out to his father, Sakr says: “He definitely struggled to believe that I was queer because I was so masculine in my presentation,” he explains. “I have a beard; I am 6′1″; people are more likely to be afraid of me than to think ‘there goes a guy who likes men’. The masculinity is what he struggled with and maybe if I was more femme he would have been [able to] see it.” Sakr hopes his novel enables “queer Arabs and Muslims to feel more at home in the world, to be more comfortable being themselves”. After all, he’s not shied away from embracing his identity, despite saying it’s “contested”. “Various people in each community try to erase me,” he says. “The Muslim community wants to say that I am not Muslim because I am bisexual, the queer community wants to say I am not queer because I fell in love with a woman and married her, the Arab community wants to say I am not Arab because my father’s Turkish, the Australian community [won’t] have anything to do with me because of all of the rest of it. “I don’t have any doubt about who I am, and it comes through in my work loud and clear.” Son of Sin by Omar Sakr is out now through Affirm press",Arts/Books,"‘I had a lot of self-loathing’: Omar Sakr on being queer, Arab, Muslim and Australian",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/01/i-had-a-lot-of-self-loathing-omar-sakr-on-being-queer-arab-muslim-and-australian
3/1/2022,"More so than other basic items of clothing, T-shirts are not all created equal. Almost everyone I’ve ever met has a favourite one. Sometimes the reasons are tangible: the softness of the fabric, the fall through the body, the neckline. Sometimes they’re more elusive, such as the way it makes us feel or how well we sleep in it. And sometimes they’re extremely sentimental: a T-shirt from a concert, a team, a relationship. For my friends who collect vintage tees, the reasons are even more complex. When they find and buy a piece of history they can wear, their excitement and enjoyment is palpable, like they’ve captured a moment in time: that Janet Jackson concert, the original Lion King movie, when the Bulls were champions. But old shirts can be fragile. This week I asked some expert collectors how to keep vintage tees in good condition. By definition, vintage T-shirts will have aged, so the fibres they’re made of are more delicate and need to be handled with care. Whenever you’re wearing a vintage tee, try to keep this in mind and be wary of doing anything too messy. Ryan Wodson, the co-owner of Melbourne vintage store Retrostar, says “food and drink stains or tears can very quickly wreck a piece of history for good”. His suggestion? “If you want it for a long time, treat it that way.” He recommends being gentle with your vintage tees and keeping them clean so they don’t need to be washed too often. “The more you wash something, the faster it will show wear,” he says. “I try to avoid washing any vintage tees when they don’t really need it.” A cautious approach will also keep the collar in good shape. “Many vintage tees have a higher collar than usual,” Wodson says. When getting dressed or undressed, “try not to tug at [the collar] or pull at it … the less you mess with a tee, the better.” The print on a vintage tee is usually the most exciting and valuable detail, and unfortunately one of the first things to show signs of wear. According to Wodson, prints start to fade for two reasons: washing and sunlight. “If you don’t want a faded tee, always hang it inside-out after washing,” he says. Hand washing, as infrequently as possible, will avoid agitation and wear from the washing machine. While washing less is ideal, sometimes you will obviously need to clean your vintage T-shirts. To protect them, Leroi Waddington, the co-owner of Route 66 in Sydney, suggests placing them inside a pillowcase before hand washing or machine washing on cold. He says to only machine dry a T-shirt if you want to shrink it. If a tight or cropped T-shirt doesn’t appeal to you, dry it by turning it inside out, hanging it on a clothes rack and keeping it out of direct sunlight. Moth holes and rips in the fabric are some of the other effects of ageing. One option is to embrace these imperfections. “Holes are part of a great vintage T-shirt,” says Wodson. “You are often wearing something that no one else will see again. They’ll love it because it’s unique, not because it’s perfect.” Waddington also feels the holes give a T-shirt more character, but says if you don’t want holes you can always get them repaired and stitched. He recommends engaging a tailor or invisible mender if you’re not confident with a needle and thread. If you’re wondering whether that “It’s time” T-shirt is really from 1972, there are a few ways to spot an authentic vintage find. The first thing to do, Wodson says, is to check the print for a copyright symbol and year. Then check the label. He says an obvious giveaway for fake vintage is a modern label from a brand you can buy today. Instead keep an eye out for labels from the 80s (which were made of silk) and 90s (which were made of paper). Also check where the T-shirt was manufactured. The big shift away from domestic apparel production in Australia, the US and parts of Europe took place over the 1990s. For American concert or sports tees that predate the 1990s, “made in the USA is always a good sign,” Wodson says. Waddington also suggests doing research on the details on the label to verify a T-shirt’s authenticity. Other things to look out for are a single stitch hem and 35/65% poly-cotton blends, because they were more common in the 1980s.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Caring for vintage T-shirts: ‘If you want it for a long time, treat it that way’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/01/caring-for-vintage-t-shirts-if-you-want-it-for-a-long-time-treat-it-that-way
3/1/2022,"General practitioners should have access to training to provide patients with more advanced mental health care in response to the critical shortage of psychiatrists, the peak body for GPs has recommended. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) has called for a comprehensive government restructure of Medicare to address the mental health “national emergency”. RACGP president, Dr Karen Price, said given some patients were unable to get an appointment with a psychiatrist, with one in three psychologists closing their books to new patients, GPs needed to be given the time to develop the skills, as well as the Medicare subsidies, required to treat them. In order to address shortages of obstetricians, particularly in rural and remote areas, general practitioners can undertake extra training to provide some of the less-specialised aspects of obstetric care. Price said a similar model was needed for psychiatry so that GPs could do extra training and provide more advanced mental health care. “The reality is that general practice is the most accessible service for many people who require mental health care,” Price said. “In some areas outside of major cities, GPs are the only option.” According to the National Rural Health Alliance, there are 2.2 times as many psychiatrists per 100,000 people employed in major cities as there are in remote areas, and 5.3 times more than in very remote areas. There are 4.1 times as many psychologists and 2.6 times more mental health nurses employed in major cities than in very remote areas. “This is a national emergency, plain and simple,” Price said. Price said the federal government needed to make longer telephone consultations with GPs a permanent fixture of Telehealth. As part of the pandemic response, the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, announced in January that rebates for longer telephone consultations for GPs would be extended until 30 June. “That isn’t good enough – we need to make this permanent,” Price said. “The way Medicare is structured must change. The current model discourages GPs from treating more than one condition in the same consultation and from conducting longer consultations. Many patients will need time to talk through their mental health issues, it’s not as simple as stitching up a split lip.” The RACGP is also calling for a new “service incentive payment” for GPs who provide early identification and ongoing management of mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. Service incentive payments are payments made by the government directly to individual GPs if they provide specific services such as after-hours care or care in aged care facilities. For example, eligible GPs can get four payments totalling $10,000 for the financial year, in addition to their consultation fee, for providing a certain number of Medicare-subsidised services in registered aged care facilities. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Price said GPs should get similar payments for providing mental health treatment plans, which would include at least one review and a physical health assessment. “General practice does huge amounts of mental health including psychosis identification, early interventions, as well as maintaining mental health for people with schizophrenia and with bipolar disorder,” she said. “A lot of these patients don’t spend a lot of time in hospital, but do spend a lot of time with their GP. We know many people with very severe mental health issues also have chronic health conditions which need to be addressed and GPs also help manage that as well.” Guardian Australia has contacted Hunt’s office for comment. President of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists Association, Prof Vinay Lakra, said in the last budget the federal government had provided funding for a diploma for doctors wanting to upskill in psychiatry. This program was in the early stages of development, he said. Lakra said he supports the proposals put forward by the RACGP. “Lots of GPs are keen to provide this mental health care, and the reality is many patients can’t afford a psychiatrist.” But Australian Psychological Society (APS) president Dr Zena Burgess said the APS wanted to see the GP referral red tape removed for patients “first and foremost” before any other reforms. “Allowing a patient to see a psychologist for up to three sessions under a mental health care plan, without referral from a GP, would get patients to psychologists sooner and ease pressure on our GPs,” she said. “We’d like to see the regional relocation incentives given to GPs replicated for psychologists, to help us attract more psychologists to rural, regional and remote Australia where we know patients are crying out for help.” She added that a federal investment of just $5m would create more than 3,500 supervisors and 6,000 additional placement psychologists within two years.",News/Australia news,"GPs should be trained to treat more mental health patients to ease ‘national emergency’, peak body says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/01/gps-should-be-trained-to-treat-more-mental-health-patients-to-ease-national-emergency-peak-body-says
3/1/2022,"The floods came after months of pandemic induced stress, affecting communities and businesses already financially and emotionally crippled by Covid-19 and harsh social restrictions. New freedoms were just coming into play, with masks and QR check-in requirements removed in many New South Wales settings on Friday. The changing rules started to increase trade and the spirit of local communities in the region. In northern NSW, the pubs were busy again. People were out at the shops, and an element of cautious optimism was evident among the business owners at cafes and retail stores. Then the rains came down, so quickly and so heavily that even the most dedicated weather watcher was caught unprepared. The NSW premier Dominic Perrottet urged the northern rivers community to be patient, rather than endanger their lives taking risks around flood waters. Lismore has borne the brunt. People clung to roofs and power poles, while locals in tinnies risked their lives to rescue their neighbours. The SES received 927 calls for assistance across the area in 24 hours and the defence forces were called in to help. In Kyogle, the first text messages from the NSW SES warned of “unprecedented flooding” about 10am on Monday morning. Residents began digging trenches, filling sandbags and watching as the rain carved flood paths across their properties. Kyogle couple Kerry and Terry Winkler managed to get a couple of dozen sandbags in place to stop water rushing straight down the driveway and into the front door of their home. “The councils drainage pipes are just not sufficient to deal with it but the local police and young fellows did a great job,” Winkler said. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Stranded visitors took refuge in local houses as the roads were cut off, including Anzac Drive from the western side of town. Businesses across the region, including in Kyogle and Lismore, tried to rescue stock from the torrent. Andrew and Megan Wilson were among those helping to sandbag homes. In 2008 they escaped disaster when flood waters reached more than 18m. Also on board were some local police and a bunch of young peoplewho pitched in to help rescue other’s houses. “There’s always someone worse off,” an old Lismore local told the television news.
