1/16/2022,"The purpose of this column is usually fairly clear: to look ahead at the biggest event in the coming week. But this time we are breaking with tradition to bring you the week’s biggest non-event: Davos. Every year the great and the good gather in the Swiss Alps at the grandly titled World Economic Forum to give their answers to the big questions. But Covid-19, running now into its fourth calendar year, has seen it called off again.  In the absence of a real-life forum this month, the Observer is publishing, as a public service, a summary of the talks not given, the panels that remained ungathered, the roundtables not tabled. As coronavirus spread around the world, it caused turmoil in financial markets, but they quickly snapped back and US equities have hit a series of new records. Broad measures of inequality are notoriously unreliable, but one obvious sign is seen right at the top, with 10 “centibillionaires” – people worth more than $100bn – according to Bloomberg’s daily league table. Hosted by Davos founder Klaus Schwab, engineer, economist and expert in getting the world’s richest people in the same room. Central bankers did manage to get to their own mountain resort working holiday in the summer at Jackson Hole, but since then inflation has really jumped up the agenda, thanks to surging global gas prices and disruption to supply chains. So are the Fed’s Jerome Powell and the Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey really willing to play the role of monetary hawks? Hosted by Jens Weidmann, the German economist who spent a decade crying wolf on inflation at the European Central Bank, only for price rises to arrive just after he left. The pandemic originated in China, but as that country overtakes the US as the great global economic power, will the world fall into a “Thucydides trap” and tend inexorably towards war? Hosted by HSBC boss Noel Quinn, whose bet is on Beijing, if his company’s apparent willingness to overlook Chinese repression is any guide, along with JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, who managed an impressive two apologies after joking that his bank would outlast China’s Communist party. There is no shortage of people willing to go on about how cryptocurrencies will change the world. Just ask Kazakhstan, where bitcoin mining may or may not have been a factor in recent energy price protests. Candidates for a Davos panel might include El Salvador’s crypto-bro president Nayib Bukele, underwear tycoon/PPE connoisseur/bitcoin enthusiast Michelle Mone, and Twitter founder/payments boss/Victorian sage Jack Dorsey. The pandemic has proved a financial and public relations triumph for big pharma, which has (with honourable exceptions) firmly cashed in. So what next for biotech? Hosted by noted thought leader Elizabeth Holmes alongside Jacek Olczak, chief executive of cigarette maker Philip Morris International, which wants to move towards net zero dead customers by buying an inhaler company. Big economics had already quietly acknowledged that fiscal austerity was a bad idea after the financial crisis, but the pandemic has not so much opened the floodgates as destroyed them. Government investment is firmly back in vogue. Who better to talk us through the implications than Joe Biden, whose flagship economic policy is to “build back better” (just don’t ask how it will pass the US Senate), and Boris Johnson, whose flagship economic policy is to “build back better” (just don’t ask about new trains, parties, energy prices, tax rises, etc)?",News/Business,So no one’s going to Davos: our guide to the big issues that won’t be tackled,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/16/davos-our-guide-to-issues-unaddressed

1/16/2022,"Novelist Deborah Levy first discovered writing as a kind of therapy when her voice disappeared as a child, she has revealed. Appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, the popular British writer, acclaimed for her Booker Prize-shortlisted novels Swimming Home and Hot Milk, said her voice gradually got quieter during her schooldays in South Africa.  Born there in 1959, Levy was the eldest child of anti-apartheid activists Norman and Philippa Levy and when her father was arrested five years later, she became almost silent in response to the stress. “It’s curious. I wasn’t exactly a mute; it was just the volume of my voice got lower and lower and lower until no one could hear me,” she said. “The kids at school used to say to me, ‘are you dumb?’, and I used to nod because they would leave me alone.” Her father was held in prison for four years and her silence became a habit. Levy, now 62, recalled: “It was really about being totally overwhelmed by everything, not believing that my thoughts were in any way valuable to anyone, probably very frightened thoughts, and so I just stopped speaking.” The breakthrough came when a school teacher encouraged her to write down her thoughts: “So I had a go and I discovered my thoughts were quite loud.” The therapeutic exercise, resulting in an essay called A Record of Things I Don’t Know, which covered her father’s plight, sparked a love of creative writing that has dominated her life. “Then I invented a cat that had yellow eyes, very lonely, and could fly and do summersaults, and of course the cat was myself and I began to understand at quite a young age that you could find an avatar to be you and give it your thoughts, problems and opinions, so really that was the beginning.” The family moved to Britain when she was nine, following her father’s release from prison, and settled in West Finchley, north London. Here, it was a chance encounter with a famous film director that inspired her early professional career. As a teenager Levy worked as a cinema usher and met the late experimental film maker Derek Jarman. His words of advice persuaded her to change her plans to study English Literature at university. Instead she learned how to write for the stage and performance at Dartington College of Arts in Devon. Pax, Levy’s first commissioned play in 1984, was followed by more than a dozen dramas, but in the late 1980s she switched to writing novels. Swimming Home, which was shortlisted for the 2012 Booker Prize, initially failed to find a publisher. Its eventual success marked a new era. “That changed my life. To be valued, respected and read is an incredible privilege, it is an extraordinary feeling,” she said, explaining it came at the time she divorced from her husband, playwright David Gale. “It had been a long relationship of 23 years and it is very hard to believe that a life you had made together is not going to continue.” Levy says from the first, she saw her novels as an “opportunity to walk female subjectivity right into the centre of the world”. Last spring Levy published Real Estate, the final instalment of her ‘living autobiography’ trilogy of memoir.",Arts/Books,Deborah Levy: I used writing as therapy to help me talk again after jailing of my father,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/16/deborah-levy-i-used-writing-as-therapy-to-help-me-talk-again-after-jailing-of-my-father

1/16/2022,"Novak Djokovic has accused the Australian immigration minister of failing to ask him his views on vaccination and to consider the impact of deporting him on anti-vaccination sentiment. Djokovic made the claims in further written submissions, published on Sunday, as the full federal court began hearing his case which will finally determine whether to restore his visa, cancelled by the minister, Alex Hawke, on Friday.  Hawke concluded that Djokovic’s presence in Australia might risk “civil unrest” because he is a “talisman of anti-vaccination sentiment” because of his earlier statements and public perception of his views on vaccination. In amended submissions lodged overnight, Djokovic’s lawyers have added a counter-argument that cancelling the visa will also have the effect of inciting anti-vaxx sentiment. They cited the fact the original decision by a home affairs delegate to cancel Djokovic’s visa had done so, citing a BBC World story about backlash in the wake of that decision, later overturned by the federal circuit court. “It was irrational, illogical or unreasonable for the minister to fail to consider the influence of Mr Djokovic’s removal on anti-vaccination sentiment,” they submitted. Djokovic’s lawyers also disputed claims the tennis star is an anti-vaxxer, arguing this was based on one statement in April 2020 “well before Covid vaccines were available”. Djokovic later clarified his view when he said he was “no expert”, would keep an “open mind” but wanted to have “an option to choose what’s best for my body”, they said. “There was no evidence before the minister that Mr Djokovic has ever urged any others not to be vaccinated. Indeed, if anything, Mr Djokovic’s conduct over time reveals a zealous protection of his own privacy rather than any advocacy.” In submissions also released on Sunday morning, Hawke said that Djokovic had failed to prove the counterargument and there was “insufficient basis for the court to make this finding”. Djokovic had the onus of proof on this point, Hawke’s lawyers submitted. They submitted that in his decision the minister noted support in Australia and abroad for Djokovic to stay, the risk to Australia’s global reputation, the risk to hosting the Australian Open and “the appearance of politically motivated decision-making”. This showed the minister had adequately considered the consequences of removing Djokovic, they submitted. Even if Hawke didn’t consider the risk of anti-vaxx sentiment if Djokovic was deported, the minister argued that didn’t make his decision illogical, irrational or unreasonable, and it was not a material error. Djokovic’s amended submissions criticised Hawke for not making “the obvious, critical and easy inquiry of Mr Djokovic as to what his sentiment [about vaccination] in fact was”. Hawke responded that this exercise would have made no difference, questioning “what Mr Djokovic could have said to the minister in response”. It argued this “would not have altered the fact of his previous public statements and the views of those in the Australian community as to what his views on vaccination were”. Sunday’s hearing began with a statement from Chief Justice James Allsop explaining while appeal is possible from a single judge, no appeal will be possible from the full court. The hearing continues, with arguments expected to conclude by early afternoon Australian time and a result to follow on Sunday or Monday.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic says Australia’s immigration minister failed to ask him his views on vaccination ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/16/novak-djokovic-says-australias-immigration-minister-failed-to-ask-him-his-views-on-vaccination
