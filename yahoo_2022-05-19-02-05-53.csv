5/19/2022,"Inflation is on a white-hot tear. U.S. consumer prices surged 8.3% in April from a year ago, down slightly from 8.5% in March, but still near 40-year highs. Whether central bankers believe inflation is short-lived, prices are on the rise right now. To preserve purchasing power, investors usually turn to assets like gold and silver during inflationary times. But dividend stocks are another option. If a company can provide a rising stream of dividends over time while appreciating in value, that can give you a hedge against inflation. Of course, due to an extended bull market, most stocks don’t pay much these days. The average S&P 500 company yields just 1.5% at the moment. But there are companies with much more generous payouts. Here’s a look at three dividend stocks with above-average yields reaching as high as 8.7%. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Let’s start with a bank stock. Why? While many sectors fear rising interest rates, banks look forward to them. Central banks hike interest rates to tame inflation. Banks lend money at higher rates than they borrow, pocketing the difference. When interest rates increase, the spread for how much a bank earns widens. And it just so happens that quite a few banks, such as Bank of America, have upped their payouts to shareholders over the past year. In July, Bank of America boosted its quarterly dividend 17% to 21 cents per share. That gives the company an annual yield of 2.4% at the current share price. The stock market had a sluggish start in 2022 and Bank of America is down 22% year to date. But a major rebound could be on the horizon. Goldman Sachs has a Buy rating on the company and a price target of $51 – roughly 43% above where the stock sits today. Moving up the yield ladder is Southern, a gas and electric utility holding company headquartered in Atlanta. It serves close to 9 million customers. The utility sector is known for being a defensive play — and not just against inflation. Come what may, people still need to heat their homes in the winter and turn the lights on at night. The recession-proof nature of the business means Southern can pay reliable dividends. In April, the company boosted its quarterly payout by 2 cents per share to 68 cents per share, marking the 21st consecutive year that Southern has increased its dividend. Look further back, and you’ll see that the company has paid steady or increasing dividends since 1948. In 2021, Southern earned an adjusted profit of $3.41 per share, up 5% from 2020. Management expects adjusted earnings per share for 2022 to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.60. Trading at $74 apiece, Southern stock offers a solid annual yield of 3.7%. In April, Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton raised his price target on Southern from $68 to $80. While he kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares, the new price target implies a potential upside of 8.1%. If you really want oversized yields, you may have to look at the lesser-known stocks — like Global Partners. Structured as a master limited partnership, Global Partners is one of the largest independent owners, suppliers and operators of gas stations and convenience stores in the Northeast. At the same time, it is a leading wholesale distributor of fuel products and is involved in transporting petroleum products and renewable fuels by rail from the mid-continental U.S. and Canada. The business pays quarterly distributions of 59.5 cents per unit, which comes out to a staggering annual yield of 8.7%. In the trailing 12 months as of Mar. 31, Global Partners’ distributable cash flow covered its payout 1.7 times after factoring in distributions to its preferred unitholders. With a market cap of less than $1 billion, Global Partners doesn’t get as much Wall Street coverage as the previous two. However, the sheer size of its distribution yield makes the stock worthy of further research.

5/19/2022,"The market doesn’t seem able to find a bottom. The S&P 500 has fallen about 16% year to date, while the tech-centric Nasdaq is down 26% over the same time frame. But CNBC’s Jim Cramer sees plenty of opportunity amid the market downturn. In fact, the Mad Money host recently revealed two stocks that he wants to buy right now. Here’s a quick look at each one of them. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Cramer has been a fan of Apple for years. He says that he’s been ‘long’ on the company ever since his daughter owned a blue and a pink iPod. And due to the recent drop in Apple’s share price — the tech giant is down 20% year to date — Cramer thinks it's time to hit the buy button once again. “I want to buy it. I upgraded for the charitable trust. It’s been straight down,” he says. In the latest earnings conference call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company hasn’t been immune to supply chain disruptions. CFO Luca Maestri added that supply constraints — resulting from COVID-related disruptions and silicon shortages — could impact sales by $4 billion to $8 billion. That said, Cramer thinks the iPhone maker will be fine, citing his recent interview with Micron Technology CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. “He said phones are good,” Cramer recalls. “Higher-end phones? Good.” In the most recent quarter, iPhone sales grew 5.5% year over year to $50.6 billion and accounted for 52% of Apple’s total sales. As a leading manufacturer of graphics cards, Nvidia shares have had a solid bull run over the past decade. But that rally came to an abrupt end in November 2021. Since reaching a peak of $346 in late November, the stock has fallen about 50%. Nvidia’s plunge is substantial even when compared to other beaten-down stocks in the semiconductor sector. And Cramer has taken notice. “Nvidia has been cut in half,” he says on CNBC. “It’s the worst chart I’ve seen. Honestly, it’s so horrible that I want to buy it.” Nvidia’s business is performing well, making it a particularly intriguing contrarian idea. The chipmaker generated $7.64 billion of revenue in its fiscal Q4. The amount not only represented a 53% increase year over year, but also a new quarterly record. Revenue from gaming — Nvidia’s largest segment — increased 37% year over year to a record $3.42 billion. Meanwhile, data center — the company’s second-largest segment — saw revenue spike 71% to a record $3.26 billion. Nvidia is scheduled to report Q1 FY23 results on May 25 after the closing bell.

5/19/2022,Warren Buffett is having a good year with S&P 500 stocks — it's his kind of market. But he's suffering from his fair share of blowups.,Business/Investor's Business Daily•5 hours ago,"Warren Buffett Isn't Perfect And Is Losing Big On 6 Stocks, Too",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f3a2a9c3-75f5-3aa2-b0b7-f009d5540239/warren-buffett-isn-t-perfect.html
5/19/2022,"Keeping up the returns would be a neat trick in today’s market, as the main indexes are all steeply down for the year so far – with losses of 15% on the S&P 500 and 24% on the NASDAQ. For investors, then, the best strategy may just be to follow a winner. Billionaire investing legend George Soros is most definitely a winner. He’s built a portfolio worth billions, and had possibly the greatest bull run in hedge fund history, averaging 30% annualized returns for 30 years. Starting in 1992, when he shorted the Pound Sterling and made $1 billion in 24 hours, to his most recent 13F filings, Soros has a record of success that few investors can match. Today, Soros remains the chair of Soros Fund Management and is thought to be worth over $8 billion, a figure which would have been far greater but for the billionaire’s extensive philanthropic work. So, when Soros takes out new positions for his stock portfolio, it is only natural for investors to sit up and take notice. With this in mind, we decided to take a look at three stocks his fund has recently loaded up on. Soros is not the only one showing confidence in these names; according to the TipRanks database, Wall Street’s analysts rate all three as Strong Buys and see plenty of upside on the horizon too. Stem, Inc. (STEM) First up is Stem, a tech company that specializes in using artificial intelligence (AI) to create ‘smart’ storage systems for clean energy. In other words, that company is designing thinking batteries that are optimized for use with renewable energy production schemes. Energy storage is a major bottleneck when it comes to renewables; as we all know, you cannot power the grid with wind or solar if the breezes die down or night falls. Smart batteries will let producers squeeze higher efficiencies from optimal generation times. The company’s main product is the Athena software platform, that uses a combination of AI and machine learning to optimize the switches between grid power, on-site generated power, and battery power. The customer base includes public utilities, major corporations, and various project developers and installers. Stem estimates that its total addressable market will increase 25x by the year 2050, to reach $1.2 trillion. So Stem is getting in at the beginning of what may be a boom. And the company’s revenue growth would suggest that the ‘boom potential’ is real. The top line grew 166% from 1Q21 to 1Q22, rising from $15.4 million to $41.1 million in one year, and coming in 29% above the high end of the previously published guidance. The company’s quarterly bookings almost tripled, from $51 million one year ago to $151 million in 1Q22. And, despite running quarterly net losses, Stem finished the first quarter this year with a usable balance of $352 million in cash and liquid assets. All of this caught the attention of George Soros, who’s bought up 300,000 shares of Stem in Q1. These shares are worth $2.25 million at current prices. Guggenheim analyst Joseph Osha, rated 5-stars at TipRanks, is also bullish here. He notes that the company’s Q1 results beat his expectations, and then adds, “STEM still faces a multi-year period during which much of the company’s revenue is likely to consist of low-margin storage hardware sales, but our confidence is growing that the company should be able to earn good returns by managing and dispatching storage assets. At this point, the company’s full-year targets appear reasonable, in our view, and in fact the annualized recurring revenue target of $60–80 million by yearend looks conservative to us."" These comments back up Osha’s Buy rating on STEM stock, while his $16 price target indicates room for ~115% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Osha’s track record, click here) For the most part, Wall Street’s analysts agree that this is a stock to buy. Stem shares have 5 recent analyst reviews, including 4 Buys over 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $7.49 and its $16.40 average price target suggests its has ~120% upside ahead of it. (See STEM stock forecast on TipRanks) Webster Financial (WBS) The next Soros pick is Webster Financial. This is a holding company, the parent of Webster Bank. This Connecticut-based banking firm has approximately $65 billion in assets and offers a range of services, including consumer and commercial banking, personal and business loans, and wealth management. Webster has a commitment to growth, and in February of this year it completed its merger with Sterling Bancorp. With that transaction complete, Webster now has $44 billion in loans, $53 billion in deposits, and a network of 202 branches in the Northeast. Webster’s first quarter of 2022 showed a net interest income of $394 million, up 76% year-over-year. The company’s interest-generating assets showed substantial growth over the past year, increasing from $19.2 billion to $50.3 billion, a gain of 61%. Webster increased its loans and leases outstanding by 67%, from$14.4 billion to $35.9 billion, and saw its average deposits increase from $17.6 billion to $45.9 billion, or 62%. These gains in income and income generation supported Webster’s continued payment of its dividend, which was declared in April at 40 cents per common share. With an annualized rate of $1.60 per share, the dividend currently yields 3.45%. Turning to Soros’ activity here, the billionaire purchased 42,100 shares of WBS stock in Q1, which are now worth a total of $2.02 million. Soros isn’t the only one giving this stock some love. 5-star analyst William Wallace, of Raymond James, puts a Strong Buy rating here, and a $73 target price that suggests ~52% upside in the year ahead. (To watch Wallace’s track record, click here) Backing his bullish stance, Wallace writes: “All in, our thesis remains unchanged, where we believe cost and growth targets from the Sterling deal are attainable, and the financial merits of the deal continue to be mispriced, leaving room for upside. That said, as progress is shown towards deal targets, which look increasingly reasonable, we believe shares should recover their discount and ultimately trade at a premium relative to its mid-cap peer group valuation comparison.” Overall, of the 8 recent analyst reviews published for WBS, 6 are Buys and 2 are Holds, backing a Strong Buy rating. The stock has an average price target of $70.25, implying ~47% upside from the share price of $47.81. (See WBS stock forecast on TipRanks) Synovus Financial Corporation (SNV) Let’s wrap up with Synovus, another denizen of the financial world. This financial services company, based in Columbus, Georgia, commands some $56 billion in assets and has 272 branches across the Southeast, in Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. This is a high-growth region, known as one of the country’s economic drivers. Florida is the country’s third-largest state, and Tennessee, with no state income tax, hits above its weight in attracting business growth. This is Synovus’ playing field. In 1Q22, Synovus reported a year-over-year drop in earnings. Diluted EPS fell from $1.19 in the year-ago quarter to $1.11 in the current report. At the same time, the bank increased its loan business in the quarter. Total loans grew from $38.8 billion one year ago to $40.1 billion as of March 31. Total deposits grew a modest 3%, from $47.3 billion to $48.6 billion. Synovus still felt confident to boost its dividend payment for the first time since the start of 2020. In its March declaration, the company increased the common share dividend from 33 cents to 34 cents. At an annualized payment of $1.36, this gives a yield of 3.5%. Soros liked what he saw here, and in the last quarter he bought 40,800 shares. At current prices, these are now worth $1.65 million. The controversial billionaire wasn’t the only bull on Synovus. In coverage for Wells Fargo, analyst Jared Shaw writes, “The effects of streamlining the franchise, reducing overall credit risk, expansion into faster growing FL markets, and a head start on digital offerings were materializing throughout 2021, with increased momentum providing a boost year to date. We believe SNV reached an inflection point in 2021, and think the asset sensitivity combined with an upgraded management growth outlook for '24 will drive shares higher.” To this end, Shaw gives SNV stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, and his price target, of $65, indicates potential for 60% appreciation in the next 12 months. (To watch Shaw’s track record, click here) All in all, this stock gets a unanimous Strong Buy from the Street’s consensus, based on 7 recent analyst reviews. The stock is selling for $40.6 and its $58.71 average price target suggests ~45% upside from that level.

5/19/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Jamie Dimon was handed a rare defeat from shareholders as they rejected a pay proposal, just months after the board unfurled lucrative incentives for the JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief to stay on for a number of years. Most Read from Bloomberg US Set to Block Russian Debt Payments, Raising Default Odds Onetime Richest Singapore Tycoon Has Lost 80% of His Fortune Walmart Flashes a Warning Sign to the Entire Consumer Economy Elon Musk Has a Bigger Problem Than Twitter Bots: A Huge Debt Burden Elon Musk Does Not Care About Spam Bots The pay packages for Dimon and other company leaders were supported by just 31% of shareholders, a tally announced at the bank’s annual meeting on Tuesday. The preliminary result marks the first time since 2009 -- when JPMorgan began seeking investor votes on pay -- that a majority of shareholders declined to back the firm’s measures. The drubbing is a significant blow for the billionaire dean of Wall Street who was granted alongside his lieutenant Daniel Pinto special bonuses last year to ensure they stick around. Prominent shareholder advisers Glass, Lewis & Co. and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. took particular umbrage to those awards, recommending investors reject the pay packages -- a move that can send a message of discontent not just with executive compensation but with the company’s performance too. JPMorgan’s shares are down about 23% this year, the worst performing among Wall Street giants. The board of New York-based JPMorgan takes the shareholder feedback “very seriously” and will continue to engage with investors on pay, company spokesperson Joe Evangelisti said. The resolution was advisory, meaning that the vote is non-binding. Typically, shareholders overwhelmingly back company proposals, and the compensation proposal was the only such measure rejected at JPMorgan’s annual meeting. Shareholder rejections of such resolutions can also lead to changes. Last year, rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reversed its stance on disclosing the effects of forced arbitration after a shareholder proposal the bank had opposed was backed by almost half of investors. “That’s a very unusually low vote,” Alan Johnson, managing director of compensation consultancy Johnson Associates Inc., said in an interview of the JPMorgan tally. While the bank probably wasn’t shocked that some shareholders didn’t like its pay proposal, the results are “a little embarrassing.” Since 2009, JPMorgan has largely received more than 90% support on compensation. Prior to Tuesday, the lowest level of approval was a 2015 resolution that won just 61% of support. At the time, the board said it would consider changes to compensation policies for top executives. By contrast, Goldman Sachs’s 2021 pay package, which included one-time bonuses of $50 million each for Chief Executive Officer David Solomon and his top deputy, passed with almost 82% approval. Glass Lewis had recommended investors also reject that firm’s executive compensation. In opposing the JPMorgan executive-pay resolution for 2021, Glass Lewis noted that $52.6 million in option awards granted to Dimon, JPMorgan’s chairman and CEO, were “nearly double the size of his regular equity grant for 2021” and represented much of his $84.4 million in annual pay. The firm also criticized the $53.3 million in total compensation for Pinto which included almost $27.9 million in option awards. “The board said it intended it to be a one-off award reflecting exemplary leadership,” Evangelisti said after the vote. “The award will not vest for five years, and Dimon would not be allowed to sell any vested shares for an additional five years. The special award was extremely rare -- the first in more than a decade for Mr. Dimon -- and it reflected exemplary leadership and additional incentive for a successful leadership transition.” Pinto, 59, recently became JPMorgan’s sole president and COO after sharing those titles with Gordon Smith until Smith’s retirement at the end of last year. The pair served as acting co-CEOs while Dimon was sidelined by emergency heart surgery just as the coronavirus pandemic roiled markets. Pinto is widely viewed as the most likely replacement to Dimon, 66, in another emergency situation, but less likely in an orderly transition. In response to a shareholder question Tuesday, Dimon said he feels “great” following the 2020 surgery. Whenever asked how long he will remain CEO, he’s long joked that he’ll stay for five more years. Dimon, who’s been at the helm since the end of 2005, defended his compensation last year, calling it part of a broader “umbrella” designed to retain senior management.

5/19/2022,"The debate over the cancellation of student debt has been going on for so long in America that reiterating the arguments pro and con no longer seems necessary. What may not be so well understood, however, is how incoherent the opposition arguments are. So we'll focus on that. First, a quick tour of the student loan landscape. The alternative to cancelling student debt is to wait 20 years and then cancel it after you've ruined someone's life. The government's not going to be repaid either way. Marshall Steinbaum, Jain Family Institute To begin with, the total amount of outstanding student loans for higher education has exploded over the last two decades. The sum owed by more than 45 million borrowers stands at about $1.8 trillion today, up from about $300 billion in 2000. The average balance owed by students on the day they graduate has soared faster than the general rate of inflation, to more than $36,000 in 2020 from about $18,200 in 2007, according to EducationData.org. That includes graduate and professional school graduates. Had the amount grown since 2007 at the same pace as the consumer price index it would be only $26,000 today. For undergrads, balances have grown even faster — from about $15,250 in 2007 to about $30,000 in 2020. Even students at public universities are graduating with sizable debt obligations, averaging more than $26,300. That many borrowers struggle to repay their loans is obvious. Federal data show that more than a third of all borrowers owe more on their loans 12 years after graduation than they originally borrowed due to the compounding of interest. In this category as in virtually every other, Black students are burdened the most — 66% of them owe more after 12 years than on commencement day. Obligations on this scale not only are a drag on economic growth — households burdened by high student debt tend to delay or forgo homeownership and face difficulties in starting a family or building up savings — but also mock Americans' most cherished assumptions about the value of higher education. ""The whole premise of the main higher education industry is that a college degree pays off,"" says Marshall Steinbaum, an expert in higher education finance at the Jain Family Institute. ""A substantial cancellation would belie that idea because why would we cancel all this debt when we said your incomes would go up enough to repay it?"" With these factors simmering on the front burner, pressure on the Biden administration to cancel sizable balances of student debt has intensified. The Trump and Biden administrations already gave borrowers a great deal of relief by placing all federally backed student loans (well more than 90% of the total) in forbearance during the pandemic, that is since March 2020. From then through this August, borrowers don't have to make principal payments on those loans and interest doesn't accrue on the unpaid balances. Analysts at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an aerie for deficit hawks, have estimated that the repayment pause was tantamount to granting the average borrower $5,500 in debt cancellation as of May 1. For some reason, the committee thinks this is scandalous. Anyway, during his presidential campaign, President Biden endorsed canceling up to $10,000 in debt per borrower. Democrats in Congress, notably Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York, are pressing for cancellation of as much as $50,000. Now let's look at the most common arguments against student loan cancellation and examine why they don't hold water. First up is the argument that canceling existing debt would be unfair to all those who already paid off their loans. As I've explained in the past, this is the argument from pure selfishness and a formula for permanent governmental paralysis. It's a favorite among conservatives and those whose comfortable affluence makes them insensitive to the burdens of others. Back in 2020 GOP operative Matthew Dowd remarked in a since-deleted tweet, ""I paid for my college by working and i took out student loans which I paid back in less than ten years by scrimping on other things. Why is it fair that we just cancel all student loan debt?"" Similarly, in responding to a survey of economists conducted that year by the University of Chicago, David Autor of MIT commented, “Alongside my kids’ student loans, I’d like the government to pay off my mortgage. If the latter idea shocks you, the first one should too."" The truth, of course, is that in a healthy society government policy moves ahead by taking note of existing inequities and striving to address them. Following the implications of the ""I paid, why shouldn't you"" camp to their natural conclusion means that we wouldn't have Social Security, Medicare or the Affordable Care Act today. Those programs were all designed to relieve Americans of what Franklin Roosevelt called ""the hazards and vicissitudes of life."" Is it really sensible to say that we shouldn't have them because before their enactment seniors were left to starve and suffer illness without assistance, and some families needed to buy health coverage in an individual market that was closed to those with medical conditions or grotesquely overpriced? As Warren responded during her 2020 presidential campaign to a voter who raised this objection, ""Look, we build a future going forward by making it better. By that same logic, what would we have done, not started Social Security because we didn’t start it last week for you or last month for you?” That we're hearing this argument more these days may have something to do with general economic inequality. As economist Benjamin Friedman has written, “America has made progress mostly when living standards for the majority of the nation’s citizens are advancing.... The opposite has been true when incomes have stagnated or fallen.” The latter environment, Friedman observed, produces ""intolerant, anti-democratic and ungenerous behavior — racial and religious discrimination, antipathy toward immigrants, lack of generosity toward the poor.” Sound familiar? It's proper to remember that higher education was not always as expensive or economically exclusive as it is today. Tuition at the University of California was free from its founding in the 1860s and reaffirmed in the state's 1960 master plan for public higher education, which acknowledged the university’s role as a driver of economic growth. Raising the instructional costs for students, the master plan said, would negate “the whole concept of wide-spread educational opportunity made possible by the state university idea.” Free tuition disappeared in 1970, when an ""education fee"" — tuition by another name — was instituted at $150 a year. The system and state never looked back. UC tuition today is $13,104 for residents and $44,130 for nonresidents, and constitutes the ""largest single source of core operating funds"" for the university. While it lasted, free tuition at UC was a source of immeasurable intellectual wealth for the state. Among those who partook of the system were former governor and U.S. Chief Justice Earl Warren, diplomat Ralph Bunche, the late L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley, and writer Maxine Hong Kingston, all children of low-income families. If UC were to reinstitute free tuition — a change that would cost about $5.3 billion based on this year's university budget — would all those who had to pay for their UC education think they had been rooked? Or would they look ahead to the gains for the state more generally? The second major argument against debt cancellation is that it would disproportionately benefit the rich. The foundation of the argument is that wealthier households carry more debt than low-income households, so they would gain more from reducing their balances. In other words, cancellation would be regressive. This notion has been effectively debunked by scholars at the Brookings Institution and the Roosevelt Institute. Those from the latter calculate that ""the largest share of debt cancellation dollars goes to people with the least wealth."" Specifically, the average person in the 20th to 40th percentiles for household assets would receive ""more than four times as much debt cancellation as the average person in the top 10%, and twice as much debt cancellation as people in the 80th to 90th percentiles."" (For reference, according to the Federal Reserve, average net worth for households in the 20th to 40th percentile range is about $6,368 to $67,470; the 80th percentile starts at $558,200 and the 90th at $1.2 million.) The Roosevelt Institute's experts observe that the notion of a big giveaway to the wealthy is based on calculating the effect of cancellation only on borrowers at every wealth level, rather than basing the calculation on all households. That makes cancellation appear to be regressive because ""high-income and high-wealth households that carry student debt tend to carry it in large quantities."" Most of those households, however, have no student debt, so the benefits of cancellation to rich households overall are relatively small. Under Warren and Schumer's proposal, the Roosevelt Institute says, estimated debt cancellation of $50,000 would come to only $562 per person, including non-borrowers, in the top 10% of households. But it would come to $17,366 per person for all Black households and $12,617 for white households in the bottom 10% for net worth. Andre Perry and Carl Romer of Brookings, in collaboration with Steinbaum, demonstrated last year that student debt cancellation would help to narrow the wealth gap between Black and white households. In part that's because Black families are more likely than white families to finance their higher education with debt. As a result, student loans become yet another obstacle to wealth creation by Black families, as is seen by the fact that ""Black people with a college degree have lower homeownership rates than white high school dropouts."" White families have greater capability than Black families to fund tax-advantaged college savings accounts such as 529 accounts from current income, another factor that forces Black families into college debt. The most overlooked factor in student debt is that some portion of it is destined to be forgiven anyway, just not immediately or all at once. Those are balances subject to income-driven repayment plans, in which about one-third of all borrowers are enrolled. Those plans set payments at a given percentage of the borrower's income and provide for cancellation of any remaining balance after 20 or 25 years (depending on the program and the nature of the loan). IDRs, as they're known, have been around since the 1990s. They aren't more popular because they haven't been adequately marketed and are still optional; advocates say they should be made the default choice for all borrowers. Because the required payments often are not enough to cover accruing interest, the loan balances tend to increase over time until the cancellation date is reached — a prospect that may discourage some borrowers from signing up. Yet the implications of IDRs is almost universally overlooked in the student debt debate. These plans are ""de facto student debt cancellation,"" Steinbaum told me. With IDRs, he notes, ""the alternative to canceling student debt is to wait 20 years and then cancel it after you've ruined someone's life. The government's not going to be repaid either way."" That should place the debate on a different footing. Government policy aimed at steering more borrowers into income-driven repayment amounts to an acknowledgment that its loans will be, and should be, canceled. So why wait? Let's do it now. The longer the debate drags on, the longer the student debt overhang will widen the gap between rich and poor and Black and white, and the more the value of higher education will come into question. That won't be good for anybody.

5/19/2022,"By Krystal Hu (Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX is poised to become the most valuable U.S. startup as its valuation rose to over $125 billion in an ongoing share sale in the secondary market, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The shares, which are marketed at about $72, jumped in valuation from last October, when SpaceX's shares were sold at $56 apiece after a 10-1 split and valued the rocket company at $100 billion. No new shares have been issued in the secondary offering, but the company indicated to investors that they may do so later this year, said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified. The share sale could value SpaceX at over $125 billion, surpassing fintech giant Stripe, which was valued at $115 billion in a secondary sale.It could not be learned how many shares have been made available for sale by the company. It is common for highly valued private companies to offer shares in the secondary market to introduce liquidity for early investors and employees. Reuters could not determine if Chief Executive Elon Musk, who owns 44% of the SpaceX and signed a $44 billion deal to acquire Twitter Inc, are among the sellers. Musk is also the chief executive of Tesla Inc. SpaceX did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. The New York Post first reported on the private placement on Monday. In the capital-intensive business, SpaceX has raised $337.4 million in December and $1.16 billion in equity financing last April, according to regulatory filings. The company competes with former Amazon.com Chief Executive Jeff Bezos's space venture Blue Origin and billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic in the burgeoning constellation of commercial rocket ventures. SpaceX has already launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), including 19 rocket launches this year alone.

5/19/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors who bet against ETFs tracking Russian assets in the build up to the Ukraine invasion made the right call -- and they’ve been paying the price ever since. Most Read from Bloomberg Onetime Richest Singapore Tycoon Has Lost 80% of His Fortune Meet the Hedge-Fund Manager Who Warned of Terra’s $60 Billion Implosion Omicron Is Turning Out to Be a Weak Vaccine Elon Musk Says Twitter Must Prove Bot Claims for $44 Billion Deal to Proceed Microsoft Will Boost Pay and Stock Compensation to Retain Employees Stocks linked to Russia plunged following the outbreak of war and subsequent economic punishment meted out to the country, vindicating bearish wagers. But sanctions also made trading Russian securities almost impossible, leaving short sellers unable to exit their positions. The result? Investors who shorted -- sold borrowed shares with the intention of buying them back more cheaply before returning them -- are still borrowing, paying the associated fees indefinitely. The short-selling world is notoriously opaque and dominated by institutions who rarely disclose their bets. But based on available data, technology and analytics firm S3 Partners estimates short sellers of Russia-focused exchange-traded funds have paid around $2.6 million in borrow fees since the products were halted in early March. “Short sellers are in a position where they’re effectively halted or frozen right now,” said Jacob Rappaport, head of equities at trading house StoneX. “It’s a difficult position to be in when there’s no resolution in sight.” Of course, all the investors in funds like the VanEck Russia ETF (ticker RSX) and the iShares MSCI Russia ETF (ERUS) are effectively stuck after U.S. exchanges halted trading and issuers ceased creating and redeeming shares because underlying assets had become untradable. But generally, most fees on the vehicles have been waived so holders aren’t bleeding cash. Short sellers, on the other hand, are usually paying a daily market rate for the shares they borrowed. The average rate for the ETFs has jumped this year to about 16% from 1%, according to S3. And while short interest in the ETFs was decreasing before they stopped trading, over $96 million worth of shares in the funds remain on loan, according to S3. Ian Bezek, a Colombia-based investor and financial writer, has a $10,800 short position on ERUS. The 33-year-old is now paying an annualized borrow rate hovering at around 60%. “If the borrow fees were like 5% or 10%, then not a problem. But at 60%, it’s definitely a major aggravation,” he said. “I have no idea of when the situation will change. It’s very frustrating.” There’s still no clarity about how or when the freeze on the ETFs will end, nor how it will be resolved. Moscow-listed stocks are trading again, but foreigners aren’t allowed to sell them. Meanwhile, Russian companies with depositary receipts listed overseas -- which several of the ETFs hold -- are being forced to delist them by a law that took effect last month. One trader at a family office who is short RSX said he asked three prime brokers about how he’ll be able to cover and none of the brokers had answers. The trader, who asked not to be identified, said he also asked about obtaining shares over-the-counter, but brokers and market makers seem unwilling to conduct those transactions. The short-selling headache looks like a first in the ETF industry. In previous dramas, when a market or group of assets has shuttered, the structure of ETFs has allowed them to keep trading. When the underlying assets restarted, often they fell in line with ETF pricing. It’s a measure of the turmoil that on this occasion, ETFs had to halt, too. Read more: ETFs Finally Find a Crisis They Can’t Trade Through in Ukraine The securities-lending market falls under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission, though it’s unclear whether regulators will get involved because no rules have been broken. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment. RSX, the largest Russia-focused ETF, had an annualized borrow rate that hovered at 1% at the start of the year, according to S3. As Russia-Ukraine tensions intensified, the rate spiked above 20% before coming down slightly. The data from S3 captures the market rate, but rates can vary across brokers. Short sellers aren’t the only group hit by these rising borrowing costs. Some put holders also tapped the securities lending market to find the shares to exercise their options -- and those who did are still paying. Russell Edwards, a U.K.-based retail trader, managed to borrow 2,200 shares of RSX to exercise put options that expired in March. His brokerage requires him to pay borrow fees currently running at about 30%. It’s a minor drag on his tiny portfolio for now, but the 26-year-old has no idea how long it will last. “If suddenly those shares cost a lot more to loan and it’s at 300% next day, I don’t really have any recourse to” help avoid the fees, he said. “I’m just kind of stuck waiting.” In the fog of the invasion and sanctions, some holders and brokers have stopped making shares available to loan, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3. That, alongside the halt to new share creation by issuers, has capped the supply available to borrow, leading rates to rise, he said. Being trapped in their bearish bets has also left borrowers facing the possibility that their winning wagers will be losers by the time they can get out. They need funds and stocks trading again to cover their positions, but that would likely only happen if the Russia-Ukraine war de-escalated and the outlook improved dramatically -- which could trigger a recovery in asset prices. In such a scenario, “I wouldn’t be surprised if my short position ends up losing me a lot of money,” said Abraham Miller, a Seattle-based software engineer who is shorting ERUS.

5/19/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday pledged that the U.S. central bank would ratchet interest rates as high as needed to kill a surge in inflation that he said threatened the foundation of the economy. ""What we need to see is inflation coming down in a clear and convincing way and we're going to keep pushing until we see that,"" Powell said at a Wall Street Journal event. ""If we don't see that, we will have to consider moving more aggressively"" to tighten financial conditions. ""Achieving price stability, restoring price stability, is an unconditional need. Something we have to do because really the economy doesn't work for workers or for businesses or for anybody without price stability. It's the bedrock of the economy really."" Acknowledging the possible ""pain"" that controlling inflation might cause in terms of slower economic growth or higher unemployment, Powell said there were ""pathways"" for the pace of price hikes to ease without a full-blown recession. But if inflation does not fall, Powell said the Fed would not flinch from raising rates until it does. ""If that involves moving past broadly understood levels of 'neutral' we won't hesitate to do that,"" Powell said, referring to the rate at which economic activity is neither stimulated nor constrained. ""We will go until we feel we are at a place where we can say 'yes, financial conditions are at an appropriate place, we see inflation coming down.'"" The Fed has raised its benchmark policy rate by three-quarters of a percentage point this year, and is on track to increase it again in half-percentage-point increments at its next two meetings in June and July. Market interest rates on Treasury bonds, 30-year mortgages and other forms of debt have risen much faster in a financial tightening predicated on upcoming Fed actions. What happens next - how much more the central bank hikes rates, and how fast - depends on how the economy and inflation evolve, something Powell said the Fed would evaluate ""meeting by meeting, data reading by data reading."" His remarks solidified expectations in rate futures markets that the Fed's target rate would reach at least 2.75% to 3.00% by the end of this year and perhaps more, steadily rising from the current range between 0.75% and 1%. CME Group's FedWatch tool on Tuesday showed a greater than one-in-four prospect for the policy rate to end the year at between 3.00% and 3.25%, up from about a one-in-10 chance on Monday. 'UNTIL SOMETHING BREAKS' Economists meanwhile are divided between those who feel inflation will collapse on its own and let the Fed do less, and those who feel the central bank may need to hike in increments of three-quarters of a percentage point to ever get control of inflation that reminds some of the shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s. Data in recent weeks have been chock with conflicting signals. Retail sales, hiring, and manufacturing output all show an economy that is itself unflinching, so far, in the face of higher borrowing costs. ""The economy is strong. Consumer balance sheets are healthy. Businesses are healthy,"" Powell said, contending that strength is one reason the Fed can push interest rates higher and slow growth enough to cool inflation without causing the sort of painful contraction the central bank has used in the past to clamp down on prices. At the same time, the war in Ukraine is making food and fuel more expensive around the world, while a new round of coronavirus lockdowns in China threatens to keep prices rising for manufactured goods and industrial inputs. Coupled with still strong consumer demand in the United States, that could force the Fed into even tougher action. The Fed targets an inflation rate of 2% annually, but prices using the central bank's preferred measure are currently rising at more than three times that level. Inflation that is too fast can distort household and business planning, and, more to the point for the sense of urgency felt by Powell and his Fed colleagues, erode the ability of the central bank to keep it under control. ""Once the Fed starts hiking, they continue to hike until something breaks. Now the question becomes is what we should be looking at as a potential break? The equity market? Is it credit? Is it housing? I think that's going to be this cycle's big unknown,"" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.

5/19/2022,"The last few months, with the exception of some short bullish trading runs, have been brutal for the markets. Stocks are down, pretty much across the board. The tech-heavy NASDAQ index has fallen 25% year-to-date, while the broader S&P 500 is down 16%. As for causes to the market turndown, you can take your pick. Supply chains remain snarled, and the Chinese government’s anti-COVID lockdown policies and the Russian war against Ukraine aren’t helping that matter any. Inflation, which started taking off a year ago, remains stubbornly high, at levels not seen in 40 years or more. And while the job market continues to show gains, the economy is still short more than a million jobs from pre-pandemic levels. So it’s a tough macro-economic picture, one that makes it ever more difficult for investors to know just what moves to make. It’s time to find a signal, some sign that will show just what stocks are likely to bring returns going forward. This is where the Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool at TipRanks can clarify matters. By tracking the trading activity of corporate officers, the insiders, investors can see what stocks are getting snapped up by ‘those in the know,’ and can follow their lead. We’ve gotten that process started, pulling up the details on two beaten-down stocks that have both shown some major insider buying. Let's take a closer look. iMedia Brands (IMBI) First up is iMedia Brands, a leader in the interactive media world with a portfolio of assets including a strong presence in the niche of TV-shopping universe. iMedia’s channels include ShopHQ and ShopHQ Health, ShopBulldogTV, and ShopLaventa, along with such digital assets as the end-to-end OTT streaming service Float left, and the digital logistics service i3PL. Last fall, iMedia closed its latest acquisition, of 123tv, the German television retail marketplace, in a deal worth $93 million, including a $72 million cash payment. iMedia will be presenting its 1Q22 numbers later this month, but in a preliminary release management said it expects a top line between $154 million and $157 million. This would represent year-over-year revenue growth in the range of 35% to 38%, and would be in line with the previously published guidance of $156 million. The company expects its net loss to deepen, from $3.3 million in the year-ago quarter to the range $11.9 million to $12.3 million in the coming report. Looking ahead to the full year 2022, the company is guiding toward total revenues of $675 million to $725 million, or y/y top line growth of 23% to 32%. Meeting this preliminary report will give iMedia four consecutive quarters with sequential revenue gains. iMedia announced on May 12 the pricing of a new sale of stock, to raise about $24 million. The stock dilution pushed the shares down to 52-week low. The insiders, however, are not so worried. Four members of the company’s board made ‘informative buys’ at that time. Two of those buys were for $100K or less; the third was for $600,000. The fourth buy, however, made by director Eyal Lalo, was far more substantial. Lalo picked up 390,880 shares, putting down $1.2 million for the stock. Covering iMedia for Craig-Hallum, analyst Alex Fuhrman reminds investors that there are strong gains in store for IMBI. Fuhrman rates the stock a Buy, and his $20 price target implies an upside of a huge 813% on the one-year time horizon. (To watch Furhman’s track record, click here) ""We are encouraged that the company is able to reiterate its outlook despite volatility stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, especially considering that IMBI generates more than 20% of its revenues in Germany, Poland, and Austria via its 2021 acquisition of German TV retailer 123tv. The strong holiday season results are even more impressive when you consider that most big e-commerce companies not named Amazon (e.g. 1-800 Flowers, QVC, HSN) reported lower-than-expected results for Q4 as rising freight and labor costs have eroded margins,” Fuhrman wrote. Overall, all four of the recent analyst reviews on this stock are in agreement with the bullish outlook, giving the stock its unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at just $2.19 and their $23.50 average price target suggests a highly robust upside of 973% in the next 12 months. (See IMBI stock forecast on TipRanks) Corsair Gaming (CRSR) Let’s switch gears a bit, and take a look at Corsair Gaming. This is another tech company, but one that works on the hardware side. Corsair develops, manufactures, and markets the high-end gear that PC gamers love to have. Among Corsair’s product line are streaming equipment, headsets, smart ambient lighting, audio systems, and monitors – the peripherals that enhance the gaming experience are loved by gamers from creators to hobbyists to serious players. Corsair also supplies power supply units, solid state drives, memory chips, and case coolers. Corsair has had a hard time in recent months, as the PC gaming sector hasn’t seen as big a rebound as the more traditional brick-and-mortar economy. The reasons are manifold, and complex. While consumer spending is up, spending on games has dropped back after the initial post-lockdown bounce. The hardware and peripherals are subject to both production and supply line delays, factors which were exacerbated by the lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine. So it may be no wonder that CRSR shares have lost 50% in the last 12 months. At the same time, the financial results Corsair reported earlier this month, for 1Q22, were in-line with the previously published guidance. Corsair reported a top line of $380.7 million, down 28% from 1Q21, and reflects the year-ago quarter’s pent-up demand and the boost from government COVID stimulus checks. It is important to note that the 1Q22 revenue was up 23% from the pre-pandemic 1Q20. On the insider front, Board member Samuel Szteinbaum last week made a hefty purchase of company stock. His buy totaled 80,000 shares and cost more than $1.14 million. That stock buy bumped his holding in the company to a value of $3.63 million. Corsair stock is covered by D.A. Davidson analyst Franco Granda, who notes the headwinds that are pushing the gaming industry around these days, but still comes down on an optimistic note. “Although CRSR has done a good job at sourcing products to meet demand, industry headwinds are proving difficult to overcome for everybody. If a broken supply chain and inflation weren’t enough, COVID lockdowns in China and the Ukraine war are exacerbating the NT business. 70% of the Y/Y declines in 1Q22 originated from Europe, highlighting the impact of diminished consumer confidence, particularly following the start of the war... Despite these pressures, the company continues to gain share (innovation and product availability) in the areas it is a leader in. In fact, CRSR already exceeded its target to gain 1% share every year, in 1Q alon,” Granda opined. In line with this outlook, Granda rates CRSR shares a Buy, with a $28 price target to imply a 77% upside for the year ahead. (To watch Granda’s track record, click here) Overall, the sentiment on the Street would agree with the bulls on this gaming company. Corsair has 7 recent reviews, which break down 5 to 2 in favor of Buys over Holds and support the Moderate Buy consensus rating. Shares have an average price target of $22.43, suggesting ~42% upside from the trading price of $15.80.

5/19/2022,"The scary arm of inflation has found its way to the financials of consistently top performing Target. Target reported a wide first quarter earnings miss on Wednesday as cost increases in areas such as freight and inventory surged, not unlike what rival Walmart shared on Tuesday. The profit shortfall marked the first miss for Target versus analyst estimates since the third quarter of 2018, according to Bloomberg data. ""We never expected the kind of cost increases in freight and transportation that we're seeing right now,"" Target chairman and CEO Brian Cornell told Yahoo Finance. Target stock plunged on the news. Target estimates it may see an additional $1 billion in freight and transportation costs this year tied to near record high fuel and diesel prices. Also similar to Walmart, Target slashed its full year operating profit outlook after the challenging start to the year. The company expects its full year operating margin will be in a range around 6%. Previously, Target was looking for an operating margin of 8% or higher. Here's how Target performed compared to Wall Street estimates: Net Sales: $25.17 billion vs. $24.47 billion Comparable Sales: +3.3% vs. +1.17% Gross Margin: 25.7% vs. 29% Operating Margin: 5.3% vs. 8.13% Diluted EPS: $2.19 vs. $3.07 On a more positive note, Target's first quarter comparable sales rose 3.3% on the back of a 3.9% increase in customer traffic. Online comparable sales gained 3.2%. The company reiterated that it continues to expect low-to-mid single digit percentage sales growth. This post was updated with Target price action.

5/19/2022,"In recent months, many new crypto investors have learned a hard lesson: Prices don’t always go up. For instance, Bitcoin — the largest cryptocurrency in the world — is down 37% year to date and 57% below its all-time high of $68,990 in November 2021. While sentiment is far from bullish these days, billionaire investor Mark Cuban’s recent comments might cheer up crypto enthusiasts. “Crypto is going through the lull that the internet went through,” writes the Shark Tank star and Dallas Mavericks owner in a tweet. “After the initial surge of exciting apps, NFTs, DeFi, P2E, we saw the imitation phase as chains subsidized the movement of those apps to their chains (ala bandwidth and storage subsidies by startups in the 2000s).” Not all companies are the same. In the crypto arena, Cuban expects the winning players to be those that “use smart contracts to improve business productivity and profitability.” If you don’t want to pick individual winners and losers in the crypto world, you can still get exposure to the space through ETFs. Here’s a look at three of them. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Blockchain is more than just bitcoin. To get exposure to leading players in the segment, consider Global X Blockchain ETF. The fund invests in businesses that are solidly positioned for the increasing adoption of blockchain technology. They include crypto miners, digital asset transaction technologists and developers of blockchain applications. Global X Blockchain ETF’s portfolio currently consists of 27 stocks, with the top five holdings being Marathon Digital Holdings (11.0%), Riot Blockchain (10.9%), Coinbase Global (9.4%), Galaxy Digital Holdings (8.1%) and Northern Data (6.5%). The ETF has an expense ratio of 0.5%. First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process ETF aims to replicate the performance of the Indxx Blockchain Index. The index is made up of companies that are either actively using, investing in, or developing products that benefit from blockchain technology. The ETF holds 103 stocks, making it one of the more diversified funds in the space. While most blockchain ETFs focus on the U.S., LEGR gives investors access across the globe. In fact, the U.S. represents just 34.9% of the fund’s geographical exposure. LEGR also has geographic exposure to China (11.5%), Germany (8.5%), India (7.4%), France (5.4%), the U.K. (5.0%) and Switzerland (3.0%) among others. LEGR’s expense ratio is 0.65%. If you simply want to invest in large cryptocurrencies, Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund is worth a look. The fund tracks an index made up of the 10 largest crypto assets weighted by market capitalization. Because cryptocurrencies are often highly volatile, the index is rebalanced monthly to stay up to date with the rapidly changing market prices. The fund’s five largest holdings are Bitcoin (63.7%), Ethereum (27.9%), Cardano (2.0%), Solana (2.0%) and Polkadot (1.4%). BITW has a relatively high expense ratio of 2.5%.
