3/12/2022,"Aid workers are demanding “safe, unimpeded” access to hundreds of thousands of people forced to leave their homes in Ukraine, amid warnings that the number of people displaced within the country by the Russian invasion could reach nearly 7 million. On Friday, the UN said 1.85 million people had been displaced internally by the conflict, a figure widely believed to be an underestimate in a highly volatile and rapidly changing security situation. With the flow of people fleeing westwards likely to intensify in coming days, humanitarian workers said in many cases they had been unable to get aid to the most vulnerable within Ukraine. Sam Smith, spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said with Ukrainian Red Cross colleagues, they had delivered supplies to some locations. “But this is just a drop in the ocean when we are faced with skyrocketing levels of need,” he said. “We want to do more, but security is making operations incredibly challenging,” he added. “We face great difficulties in being able to move the needed supplies. This is an extremely dangerous time for families caught in the fighting and an extremely dangerous time for aid organisations, too.” Joe Lowry, spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration, said UN colleagues and partners were trying to deliver aid “whenever and wherever possible”. But he added: “We need safe, unimpeded access to all areas affected by Russia’s military offensive. It’s essential to establish a pause in the fighting to allow for the safe passage of civilians caught in conflict to leave on a voluntary basis in the direction they choose and to ensure lifesaving humanitarian supplies can move in for those who remain.” Even before the invasion, there were an estimated 1.46 million internally displaced people (IDPs) in Ukraine, of whom 854,000 were in government-controlled areas in the east of the country. Since 24 February, hundreds of thousands of people have been on the move, mainly from the east, north and south of the country to the relatively calm west. At the same time, more than 2.5 million people have left the country. But, while they have been met with an extensive refugee relief effort, those inside the country have been facing increasingly dire conditions and patchy humanitarian support as relief efforts have been stymied by the violence. Except for an evacuation of people from the eastern city of Sumy, attempts to arrange humanitarian corridors for civilians and the passage of aid have largely failed. “Targeted attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure and lack of safe passages are … posing serious threats to the lives of thousands of civilians attempting to flee the hostilities,” the UN warned. Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls its “special military operation”. According to the UN, the war could displace up to 6.7 million people within Ukraine, 4.3 million of whom will need life-saving humanitarian assistance. For the moment, western oblasts such as Zakarpatska, Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk have been hosting the greatest numbers of IDPs, with the city of Lviv – believed to have taken in about 200,000 people – approaching “breaking point”, the UN says. Many people have been sheltering in cramped and overcrowded centres where access to electricity and water is limited. The World Health Organization has warned that infectious diseases such as Covid-19, measles or cholera could flourish in such conditions. But, according to the UN, even this inadequate shelter could soon become unavailable to many. “Given the continuous growth of the displaced population, [it is expected that] local authorities will face the lack of premises to host new arrivals shortly,” it warned. Adib Fletcher, director of humanitarian response at Project Hope, a global health and relief organisation, said in comparison with the refugee crisis unfolding beyond Ukraine’s borders the situation for IDPs was “a more difficult context … [with] a lot of different moving parts”. “I think that the sky’s the limit in terms of the actual healthcare needs at this stage within Ukraine,” he added. Data collected by UN partners found that women and children, people living with disabilities, older people and minority groups make up the majority of those displaced. Most IDPs came from the regions around the two biggest cities, Kyiv and Kharkiv. On Thursday, the mayor of Kyiv said about half the capital’s population had left, while most of Kharkiv’s 1.5 million inhabitants are thought to have fled the relentless Russian shelling. Alexandra Bilak, director of the internal displacement monitoring centre at the Norwegian Refugee Council, said it had been “virtually impossible” to quantify the scale of the IDP crisis, “mostly due to the fact that the situation changes from day to day and from hour to hour, [and] there are very few people who have the capacity or even the mental space to keep track.” Given the huge numbers involved, she added, there were serious questions over the ability of other towns and cities to manage new arrivals. The potential for sustainable solutions to the crisis was “like a dot on the horizon”, she said.",News/Global development,‘We need safe access’: aid groups in Ukraine struggle amid warning 7m could be displaced,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/12/we-need-safe-access-aid-groups-in-ukraine-struggle-amid-warning-7m-could-be-displaced
3/12/2022,"A vegetarian, gluten-free pie has claimed top prize at this year’s British Pie Awards in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. Made from jackfruit “steak”, gluten-free craft ale and black pepper, Pieminister’s Mooless Pie beat 976 entries to the supreme champion crown in Melton Mowbray, whose pork pies have traditional status. There were 23 different classes of hot and cold savoury and dessert pies and pasties for the 151 judges to consider at the competition, which returned to its traditional March timing, playing out over three days at St Mary’s Church, after the pandemic caused last year’s competition to be moved to September. Matthew O’Callaghan, chair of the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association and host of the awards, said: “This was a superb pie, it looked good, had a nice even golden bake. “The pastry was crunchy complemented by the moist filling which had ‘bite’, and the balance of flavours in the pie was just right. “Up to now, gluten-free pies were always compared unfavourably with other pies. With this pie, gluten-free pies are now equal to any other pie. “Being vegetarian and gluten free, Pieminister’s Mooless Pie is an ‘everybody’s pie’, be they vegetarian or meat eater, gluten tolerant or intolerant. Serve this at a meal and almost everyone’s a winner.” Bristol-based Pieminister’s entry beat 35 contenders to the free-from title before being judged overall winner, the first time a champion had been chosen from the category.The judges were asked to mark the pies on criteria including eating qualities, filling, and how a maker could improve their entry. Three years ago, a vegan pie was the overall winner; last year’s champion was a meat and potato pie.

3/12/2022,"In a Washington riven by discord, it can seem like a throwback to a gentler time. “I’m proud to stand with my Republican and Democrat colleagues” to send help to Ukraine, Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the US House of Representatives’ foreign affairs committee, said this week. But even as they express solidarity with Joe Biden’s stance on Russia with one hand, Republicans are launching partisan attacks against the president with the other. The party has, critics say, seized on soaring US gas prices to exploit the tragedy in Ukraine for its own political benefit. Since war broke out last month Republicans have honed a message that America achieved “energy independence” under Donald Trump only for it to be squandered by Biden, whose preoccupation with the climate crisis hurt domestic production, drove fuel prices up and strengthened oil-rich rivals such as Russia. The argument was amplified this week when gas prices hit at a record average of $4.17 per gallon and Biden announced a ban on US imports of Russian oil. He warned that while the move would hurt Vladimir Putin, “there will be a cost as well here in the United States”, and anticipated criticism by branding it “Putin’s price hike”. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, attempted to cast the issue as transcending party politics. “For many in our caucus, and I think on the other side, it’s a moral issue,” he said. “You don’t want to fuel the Russian war effort.” But the era when wars meant unity governments and a shared understanding that “politics stops at the water’s edge” is over. Republicans backed Biden’s ban on Russian oil imports but simultaneously went on an offensive that effectively absolved Putin of blame. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican minority leader in the House, told a press conference: “These aren’t Putin prices. They’re President Biden’s prices.” Mike Pence, the former vice-president, told the Fox Business channel: “In the four years of the Trump-Pence administration, we achieved energy independence for the first time in 70 years.” “We were a net exporter of energy. But from very early on, with killing the Keystone pipeline, taking federal lands off the list for exploration, sidelining leases for oil and natural gas – once again, before Ukraine ever happened, we saw rising gasoline prices.” Factcheckers have pointed out that the main cause of increasing gas prices over the past year is disruptions to global supply and demand following the coronavirus pandemic. Only a 10th of the Keystone XL pipeline was complete when Biden cancelled it and it was not likely to become operational until 2023 at the earliest. The Politifact website found that domestic oil production in Biden’s first year was on par with 2020 and higher than in three of the four years that Trump was president. The White House has also pointed out that 9,000 approved drilling permits are not being used. But none of this has prevented Republicans fixating on the issue in ways that Democrats find deeply disingenuous. Kurt Bardella, an adviser to the Democratic National Committee, said: “It just goes to show that there are no lengths to which Republicans won’t stoop to try to score political points, in this case using the unthinkable and tragic situation that the Ukrainian people find themselves in. “To try to exploit that and use it to effectively lie and mislead the American people about conditions here at home is an unconscionable act of political cowardice.” He added that Republicans, in thrall to “big oil”, have spent the past two decades opposing the very measures that would have made America less dependent on foreign oil and fossil fuels in general. Green technology would have shielded the US from the effects of the Ukraine crisis on global markets. Bardella, a former senior adviser for Republicans on the House oversight committee, added: “Republicans were so vocal about how the Biden administration needed to do sanctions on Russian oil and then they start attacking him. You can’t win because everything that they do is basically an illustration of how they operate in bad faith.” “Joe Biden could do every single thing that the Republican party wants and they would still attack him at the end of the day. Republicans just seem to operate in a purely craven political dynamic. It’s irresponsible and downright un-American, and it’s exactly what they would have said if Democrats had done this in the wake of 9/11 or in the run up to the war on terror.” Opinion polls suggest that Biden, like other western leaders, has received a boost from his response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But inflation is likely to keep rising and prove potent in November’s midterm elections. The National Republican Congressional Committee has reportedly released attack ads against 10 House Democrats over gas prices. Ed Rogers, a political consultant and veteran of the Ronald Reagan and George H W Bush administrations, said: “‘It’s the economy, stupid.’ Biden is going to own whatever the economy is come November. Republicans don’t have to do anything to make that happen. People feel it for themselves, they observe for themselves. “You don’t have to remind people too much of gas prices and overall inflation is a big macro political issue. Doing well as an incumbent is all about peace and prosperity, and prosperity is being eroded by inflation, with gas prices being a focal point.” A messaging battle is under way with the White House seeking to tie Putin to the price rise. But Rogers said: “Republicans have a bumper sticker. Democrats have an essay. Just see how that goes.” Democratic strategists are aware that the issue could weigh heavily on midterm voters. Bob Shrum acknowledged: “The facts don’t matter much here. If gas prices are really high, that becomes a problem for Democrats in the midterms because they’re in office. It’s just a natural tendency to blame someone under those circumstances.” But he added: “It’s preposterous to think this is Biden’s fault. He hasn’t done anything that would account for high gas prices at this point. It’s the Russians’ fault but the Republicans want to ban Russian oil and then blame Biden for the shortfall in supplies and therefore the rise in prices. It’s cynical, obvious and opportunistic.” There are of course legitimate policy debates in wartime and no one suggests that a president is beyond criticism. Some Republican senators, for example, have urged Biden to accept Poland’s offer of MiG-29 fighter jets to be transferred to Ukraine. Tom Cotton said: “If we continue to blink every time Vladimir Putin says ‘boo’ it’s not going to stop in Ukraine.” But Republicans – and the conservative Fox News channel – have made gas prices and energy production their loudest argument. It is a convenient way to deflect attention from their own complicated relationship with Russia, which is not confined to Trump’s longstanding admiration for Putin and recent comments praising him as “smart” and “savvy”. This week Congressman Thomas Massie – one of three House Republicans who voted against a recent resolution supporting Ukraine – amplified a false conspiracy theory about US biological weapons labs operating in Ukraine. His colleague Madison Cawthorn was caught on video calling Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy a “thug” whose government is “pushing woke ideologies”. The hypocrisy is a sign of how the party – and Washington – have changed over the past decade, added Shrum, director of the Center for the Political Future at the University of Southern California Dornsife. “There was unity for a period of time after 9/11,” he said. “But if you go back to even Syria under Barack Obama, they were playing this same kind of game.”",News/US news,"‘Cynical, craven’ Republicans out to bash Biden, not Putin, over gas prices",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/12/republicans-joe-biden-russia-gas-prices
3/12/2022,"The Kremlin’s attempt to take the chemical weapons issue to the UN security council, claiming that the US and Ukraine might seek to deploy them, is widely seen as a device to distract from any future use by its own forces. The Pentagon has, more credibly, already voiced its concern that Vladimir Putin may choose to use them in the near future. But behind the mass media coverage is a more fundamental matter: why would the Kremlin even think about using chemical weapons? And the problem for western leaders is that their advisers will be telling them that from Putin’s perspective there may actually be reasons for doing precisely this. Consider the following. When Putin went to war he had a clear plan to achieve a specific aim: to take Kyiv, terminate the government and replace it with a client regime. In doing so, this would extend and confirm the Kremlin’s reach nearly 1,000km westward, consolidating the existing control of the Minsk regime. Both Belarus and Ukraine would have permanent Russian bases there, no doubt including nuclear-capable missiles. The whole security architecture of Europe would be changed in Putin’s favour. He would have made Russia great again. The vision required a lightning military campaign catching Nato off guard, but it also required a quiescent Ukrainian population and limited military opposition The plan came apart at the seams within 48 hours. Military resistance was intense, there were no welcoming crowds, and the Russian forces were often incompetent. Two days later, Putin delivered his threat to use nuclear weapons in response to any direct Nato intervention, while his own military forces began to regroup for a counter-city war. Sixteen days into the war, even that is proving problematic. No major city has yet been captured – not even Kharkiv, despite huge damage inflicted. Even Mariupol is not under full Russian control in the face of appalling suffering for the tens of thousands still trapped there. Meanwhile, the Russian forces face major problems of morale while the Ukraine army is receiving thousands of anti-armour and other weapons, flooding across the borders from Nato states. Putin can continue with his destructive counter-city assaults, but he will also be looking to other military postures. And it is here that the risk of chemical attacks come in, because there are two specific elements in their use that are relevant to Putin’s plan of attack. One is that they can be used against underground targets such as cellars, bunkers and even metro stations, and the other is to create widespread fear. Chemical weapons come in five main forms – blister agents such as mustard gas, choking agents such as chlorine, blood agents such as cyanogen chloride, incapacitants such as chloroacetophenone (Mace) and, worst of all, nerve agents such as sarin, tabun and the V-agents. These last have been used by Russian agents in assassination attempts, including the Salisbury attack. On 16 March 1988, Iraqi planes and artillery pounded the Kurdish town of Halabja in northern Iraq. Bombs and shells filled with sarin or mustard gas killed as many as 5,000 people, mainly women and children. The motive was to create fear right across Kurdish Iraq; a warning that opposing the Saddam Hussein regime would not be tolerated. This was probably the worst single chemical attack since the first world war, but it came near the end of the eight-year Iraq/Iran war and got little more than muted criticism from the United States and its allies, as Iraq was then regarded as an ally against Iran. A single massive assault like that is highly unlikely in Ukraine, but a few individual attacks against specific buildings in a Ukrainian town or city district are another matter. Heavier than air, chemical weapons will seep down into bunkers, cellars or even metro stations – among the few places in Ukrainian cities where people still feel some sense of security at a time of intense danger out in the open. It would be a grotesque form of psychological warfare, yet it might be tempting for Putin. His initial plan failed and his whole vision now depends on pounding the cities until the Ukraine leadership has to accept his terms. So far, though, even that is not working, as the resilience of the Ukrainian people remains strong. Putin cannot afford to fail. His future, that of those around him, and indeed his whole vision depend on success, and he has already used extreme violence to this end. The risk of chemical warfare may still be small, but it is there. If Putin comes even close to considering it, the only thing holding him back may be the attitude of President Xi in Beijing. He is the one person Putin has no option but to heed.

3/12/2022,"An extra place had been laid for a mystery guest but no one guessed the identity of the man who would take the additional seat at the dinner table. It was a warm late summer evening in Jerusalem in 2019 when Roman Abramovich joined Emma Hayes and her Chelsea players for a memorable few hours. “It was a great surprise, the players were giggling like teenagers,” Hayes would recall. “We sat around at dinner talking about Middle Eastern history and the love of working for a club that supports its women’s football team in the way Chelsea have. We spent time talking about how proud he is of us and what we do.” Until very recently Hayes was happy to enthuse about that pre-season tour of Israel and the day she and the players spent on a private sight-seeing trip alongside Chelsea’s owner in Jerusalem. With the Wailing Wall serving as an evocative backdrop, the Russian oligarch stood shoulder to shoulder with her as they posed happily for photographs beneath a searing Levantine sun. “It was a wonderful, brilliant self-reflective day,” said Chelsea’s manager. “The experience was immensely spiritual for everyone. It’s brought us closer together and reinforced the value of taking care of each other. Roman spending time with us in Israel meant an awful lot.” Three years ago few of those staring up at the Mount of Olives can have envisaged the geo-political train hurtling down the track towards them. Back then Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine seemed almost inconceivable. The idea that the British government would impose sanctions on Abramovich, placing Chelsea in paralysing limbo as his UK assets were frozen, would have been dismissed as fanciful by journalists wary of mentioning the infamously litigious owner’s ties with Putin. As the only manager to have survived a full decade under Abramovich’s regime, Hayes was closer than most to an enigmatic Russian who once enjoyed deep dinner table conversations with Rafael Benítez but, particularly in recent years, has often distanced himself from his men’s team managers. Significantly, last May Chelsea’s owner entered the away dressing room in Gothenburg to commiserate with Hayes’s players after their 4-0 defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League final. Touched, the manager pledged to win the trophy one day “for Roman” and could not possibly have imagined that her world would implode 10 months on. Now arguably the most talented coach in the domestic women’s game is striving to preserve the empire Abramovich’s money helped her create at Kingsmeadow. Since arriving at Chelsea in 2012 and surviving an early relegation scare it is no exaggeration to say Hayes has played a key role in transforming the entire topography of elite female football in England. After leading her side to a first Women’s Super League title in 2015 she has recaptured the trophy three times, while also celebrating a trio of FA Cup triumphs and twice winning the League Cup. Along the way, Chelsea raised the collective bar, a desire not to be upstaged persuading other leading clubs, most notably Manchester City and Manchester United, to invest heavily in their women’s teams. Anxious not to be left behind, Saudi Arabian-owned Newcastle have pledged to build a female side that will challenge for silverware. Given that leading players in the fully professional WSL can earn up to £250,000 a year, it is quite a commitment. Tellingly, though, Hayes’s success opened rival clubs’ eyes to the female game’s previously untapped commercial potential. Today WSL sides are studded with overseas talent but it was Hayes who made the first marquee foreign signing with her acquisition of the South Korea midfielder Ji So-yun in 2014. Ji was the women’s game’s answer to Lionel Messi and her arrival paved the way for numerous imports. Typically, Chelsea set a world record female transfer fee when they paid Wolfsburg about £300,000 for the Denmark forward Pernille Harder in 2020. Chelsea kick off at home to Aston Villa on Sunday in second, five points behind the leaders, Arsenal, but with two games in hand. Yet for the moment the music has stopped at Kingsmeadow, where only season-ticket holders will be admitted, at least for now, after the ban on general ticket sales. While Hayes frets about losing a quintet who will be out of contract in the summer – Ann Katrin-Berger, Maren Mjelde, Jonna Andersson, Ji and Drew Spence – Kingsmeadow regulars fear Abramovich’s eventual successor may be disinclined to invest in their side. After all, a Liverpool board obsessed with bolstering Jürgen Klopp’s ambitions allowed a female team that won successive titles in 2013 and 2014 to slip into second-tier obscurity two years ago. Similarly, in 2018, the FA demoted Sunderland two divisions when the billionaire Ellis Short sold up and the financial taps were turned off. Only time will tell if Chelsea’s moment in the sun is over but, whatever happens, Hayes has already left an indelible impression on the women’s game, changing it virtually beyond recognition.",Sport/Football,Hayes strives to preserve Chelsea empire Abramovich helped her create | Louise Taylor,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/12/chelseas-women-hope-their-success-continues-after-abramovich
3/12/2022,"High in the Bolivian Altiplano, Challapata is where the road from La Paz splits: one way to Potosí and the other to Uyuni and the salt flats. It seems an unremarkable place; many tourists steam through without even realising. But Bolivians know it to be home to the country’s biggest contraband car fair, a hub in a trade network that reaches from Japan to the Bolivian Amazon. Contraband cars – known as chutos – are nothing new in Bolivia. But those behind the business have recently received a fresh burst of attention, as a younger generation has taken to posting videos of their adrenaline-fueled border runs on Tiktok. Efraín, 35, said he started out as a chutero when he was 12. In the ensuing years, the fundamentals of the trade have stayed the same: second-hand cars from richer countries, like Japan, are bought and shipped to Iquique, a free port in Chile. From there – along with other cars stolen in Chile – they are spirited across the long desert border with Bolivia, using clandestine paths to avoid military patrols. “It’s very risky, but it’s profitable, too,” said Efraín. “And it’s exciting. It’s like taking part in the Dakar Rally. At least I see it that way, because you have to drive through the night with no lights. That way, the soldiers don’t see you. You can pass under their noses without them realizing. But if you turn the lights on, suddenly you see in the distance, one, three, five, 10 lights coming for you.” At 35 years old, Efraín is a veteran– and he said it’s the teenagers that are using TikTok. Videos show groups of chuteros drinking and making ritualistic offerings before journeys; others show convoys of SUVs tearing across the salt flats; some show wrecked and burnt-out vehicles lost on the way. Almost all of these videos are set to one song – Chutero Yo Soy, by Simon Latorre – that has become an unlikely viral hit. A conversation with a chutero close to Latorre yielded a phone number. When he answered the phone, he did so in the third person: “Simon Latorre at your service.” Latorre himself is not a chutero, nor even Bolivian: he’s from Juliaca, a city in southern Peru. But he had a Bolivian friend who was a chutero, and it was through him that he saw the lifestyle. “He would go bravely into the night, and come back with his cars,” said Latorre. “Then he would go out again. He didn’t even have time to sleep. Such is the sacrifice he had to make. Sometimes he would say he’d had problems, that he’d run into the army, they’d opened fire, things like that.” His friend asked him to compose a song about chuteros, for chuteros. And so he wrote Chutero Yo Soy, which he started performing in towns along the Bolivia-Chile border. Then they asked him to perform in Challapata. “What a welcome. Honestly, I didn’t know Challapata before that, but when I went to perform loads of people turned up, and they knew my songs and sang along. There’s nothing better as an artist.” Tania Jiménez, a sociologist who carried out years of fieldwork among chuteros, and more recently a digital ethnography, notes that being a chutero is a kind of identity, with a culture of rituals, fiestas and songs around it. Very few women are involved, and the songs reflect that. “They’re about sacrifice, and having the courage to dare to do it – there’s a marked sense of masculinity.” The vice-minister of the fight against contraband recently compared chutero culture to that of drug-trafficking gangs. “That’s ridiculous,” laughed Jiménez. “Very forced.” She said that groups having their songs is commonplace in Andean culture. “If you strip it of its cultural context, of course it could look like the culture of criminal groups in Mexico. “But honestly,” she adds, “I think it’s stupid that they’re putting these videos up. We all know that they’re on Facebook: if you go and search ‘autos chutos’, there are loads of groups. People will even deliver one to you. But these videos are a kind of ostentation of what they do.” That the song went viral has been a source of some anxiety for Latorre. “I sometimes worry that the Bolivian authorities might turn against me, asking why Simon is singing these songs dedicated to chuteros. But I’m just a songwriter – I don’t do this work myself,” said Latorre. “I hope that’s how the authorities see it.” Meanwhile the chuto business drives on. Analysts reckon perhaps 25,000 chutos enter Bolivia every year, and some of the money earned gets piled back into fiestas where Latorre might perform. His representative says he does two or three gigs a month in Bolivia. “People call me every day asking for a shoutout in my next song,” said Latorre. He reflected for a moment. “I have more fans in Bolivia than in Peru. Some people know me here – but not like in Bolivia.”",News/World news,"‘Risky, profitable, exciting’: TikTok fuels Bolivia’s contraband car craze",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/bolivia-tik-tok-chutero-simon-latorre-car-theft
3/12/2022,"If you looked through Bradley Meinz’s living room window, you’d see the Hollywood sign. The photographer lives in LA’s Beachwood Canyon, and in February 2020 he was taking daily hikes to the landmark and back. News of a pandemic was beginning to circulate, and the streets were uncharacteristically deserted. It was on one of those hour-long walks that he stumbled across this man, taking a moment for himself in the warming winter sun. “The red and white sign was up for some kind of movie or photoshoot, to allow production trucks to park,” Meinz says. “Anyone who knows LA knows the sheer density of traffic and bodies, yet there is a void of that here. Instead, there was this lone, shirtless guy, not even on the sidewalk, but ‘parked’ on the street. He’s flouting the rules, but not in a serious way.” The Hollywood sign is just out of shot, though Meinz doesn’t regret its absence. “You still know which city you’re in, as the hills are visible, and the palm trees, which are such a huge ornament of LA,” he says. “The sign would have caused too much competition – it’s the hero of every photo it’s in.” Meinz didn’t disturb the rule-breaker, who had his eyes closed.

3/12/2022,"Jack Kerouac – anti-establishment icon, revolutionary author of the American classic On the Road, pioneer of the Beat Generation and, perhaps most of all, enduring symbol of cool. If a dog-eared paperback of On the Road slung in your back pocket was once the ultimate avant-garde accessory, 100 years after his birth, a Kerouac namecheck has become something of a trope on dating apps. New analysis by OkCupid has shown that mentions of the Beat poets and On the Road in profiles (more often on those belonging to men) have increased more than threefold in the past five years. With their themes of travelling, male friendship and flight from the nine-to-five to explore a world of sex, drugs and art, it’s easy to see why men want to align themselves with Kerouac’s books. The anarchist ideals of On the Road characters Dean Moriarty and Sal Paradise are ones that “alternative” or “indie” communities have often shared. As a result, Kerouac remains present in popular culture like few other authors: his face appears on Christian Dior sweatshirts, as recently worn by Benedict Cumberbatch; his book The Dharma Bums features in the TV show Ted Lasso; and British band the 1975 took their name from random scribbles on the back page of On the Road (“1 June The 1975”). Amid record-high rates of job resignations and a reported “vibe shift”, a renewed interest in Kerouac suggests a post-pandemic revival of the Beatnik spirit – of casting off the shackles of convention to chase down the spirit of Dean Moriarty. But insofar as Kerouac is invoked as a symbol, his meaning is not uniformly understood. To some, he is an aspirational iconoclast; to others he is the face of white male privilege. His alter ego Sal Paradise may have been inspired by his time working on a farm in California, for example, but he always had the option of returning home, or of being sent money by his aunt. Kerouac himself was a white, university-educated man who returned from his travels to have his meals cooked and his washing done by his mother. Moreover, sixty-five years since publication, the misogyny of On the Road looks overt, even gleeful: Moriarty’s “awfully dumb” 16-year-old wife Marylou is instructed “to make breakfast and sweep the floor” within the first three pages. Holly George-Warren, author of a forthcoming authorised Kerouac biography, says he depicted women as “objects of the male gaze and little else”, and drew from racist tropes in “romanticising the ‘other’” – for instance when Sal and Dean see freedom in the way that Mexican people live. Readers today may find these things repellent, George-Warren acknowledges, but it is only one aspect of the complicated and often contradictory author. As much as Kerouac benefited from his privilege, elsewhere he rails against it. “He explored gender, sexuality and queerness openly in his work during a time when to do so was very rare … and he did write with deep empathy about marginalised people,” says George-Warren. An unqualified passion for Kerouac has nonetheless come to register as a red flag to some straight women swiping through potential partners, as a staple of “straight male reading culture”. His reputation is such that he is just as often invoked to signify tortured masculinity imposed on long-suffering women as he is for his pioneering writing. In the TV show Gilmore Girls, for example, Paris admonishes Jess for his “typical guy response” to the Beats’ drug-fuelled bromance, and, in Mad Men, the womaniser Don Draper sees Kerouac in a hallucination. This kind of “bro-ish” love of Kerouac can be seen as an adolescent phase. As writer Helena Fitzgerald wrote in praise of getting older for Electric Lit: “Nobody has tried to talk to me about Jack Kerouac in at least five years.” But the image of the author that people are repelled by or drawn to – the all-American, hyper-masculine hero of the open road – “is the myth of Kerouac”, not the reality, says Jean-Christophe Cloutier, an associate professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania. Kerouac was handsome and a talented football player. But he was also the son of working-class Catholic immigrants from Québec. Jean-Louis, as Kerouac was born, did not learn English until he was six years old, and struggled through most of his teens. Cloutier, himself Québécois, has translated Kerouac’s French novellas and says the author felt outside American culture all his life. On the Road becomes a different journey when read from this marginalised perspective. But the mythologising of Kerouac was almost instantaneous on its publication in 1957, with a rapturous New York Times review declaring it the “most important utterance yet” of the Beat generation. The author “didn’t help himself”, acknowledges Cloutier, by claiming to have written it in just three weeks, leading to Truman Capote’s well-known dismissal: “that’s not writing, that’s typing.” Presented with a bona fide movement, the media machine went into overdrive, peaking with the Village Voice’s “Rent-a-Beatnik” stunt in 1959, where arty types were hired to attend parties for $40 a night. Kerouac’s literary achievement was inseparable from his commercial one: as William Burroughs wrote, “On the Road sold a trillion Levis and a million espresso machines, and also sent countless kids on the road.” For Kerouac, success was a bitter pill with which he struggled until his death in 1969, aged just 47, after more than a decade of alcoholism. “It was one of his great sadnesses … [The Beats] were so against materialism and consumer culture, and here they are being co-opted,” says Cloutier. It was precisely that countercultural cachet that made them such an enduring brand, as evinced by the Gap’s 1993 “Kerouac wore khakis” campaign. But where Kerouac the myth was marketable, the man was emphatically not. Portrayed as a hard-living free spirit, Kerouac was in fact dedicated to his craft and lived a mostly “monastic life” with his mother and his Persian cat Tyke. It’s probably not this Kerouac – “the bilingual, struggling, poor, reclusive” writer, whose cat was his “baby” – being swiped through on dating apps, points out Cloutier. But that is the double-edged sword of iconic status: few authors are so well known or as widely misunderstood. As Kerouac’s friend Seymour Krim wrote after his death, he was a “bleeding ball of contradictions” that cost him all his life: “Kerouac had myth to him all right … but it only came through his remarkable ability to become his own ‘true’ self on paper.” In this commitment to honest self-expression – what Kerouac termed creating a “telepathic shock” with his reader – he inspired a greater range of artists than he is sometimes given credit for: David Bowie and Bob Dylan, yes, but also Haruki Murakami, Hanif Kureishi, Lana Del Rey, writers of autofiction and even feminist works of art. Introduced, inevitably, to Kerouac by her then-husband Russell Brand, Katy Perry wrote Firework, an empowering pop song about Sal Paradise’s paean to people who “burn like fabulous yellow roman candles”. And the original millennial feminist, Lisa Simpson, has On the Road on her bookshelf. Alison Bechdel, in her latest graphic memoir The Secret to Superhuman Strength, writes of being inspired by The Dharma Bums to climb a mountain and “make a drastic change” in her life. Much of Kerouac’s work does not pass Bechdel’s eponymous test for female representation. Cloutier notes, however, that the “earliest and best” Beat scholars were women: Ann Charters, Regina Weinreich, Nancy Grace, and Joyce Johnson (who wrote Minor Characters about her relationship with Kerouac and his work). “There’s a way to look at it beyond gender,” insists Cloutier of On the Road, “As a journey of discovery for any human being – and one being undertaken with ultimate candour.” It might be that what some find hard to stomach about Kerouac is not his writing, not even the man himself, but his brand and its fans. In the face of the spirited dudebro defence, readers often miss Kerouac’s spirituality and his respect for nature, says George-Warren – even his emergent climate consciousness. “His anti-materialism, very rare during the postwar years … predicted what over-consumption has done to the planet.” And Cloutier suggests that the Beats’ anti-conformist message is especially relevant now, as binary public debates and insidious algorithms make it harder than ever to think for oneself. If you can get away from the image, read his books, get that telepathic shock – he can be a companion on any journey,” says Cloutier. One hundred years after his birth, it’s time to see beyond sweatshirt Kerouac to the “strange solitary crazy Catholic mystic” he saw himself as. But whether that would be any more successful on a dating profile I couldn’t tell you.
