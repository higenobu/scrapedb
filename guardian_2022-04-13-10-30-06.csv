4/13/2022,"A centrepiece of the Queensland government’s pandemic response – a $1bn concessional loan scheme for businesses – was beset by administrative problems, such as grants being approved improperly and claims of nepotism during the rapid recruitment of temporary staff, the state auditor general has found. A report by the Queensland Audit Office found that the quick ramp-up of staff required to administer the Covid support program had resulted in cases where close relatives of public servants were hired, and where conflicts of interests were not declared among members of hiring panels. “This increases the risk of inappropriate contracts being entered into and value for money not being obtained,” the report, tabled in parliament this week, found. Grants were approved by staff for amounts above what they were allowed to approve, and one contract was approved in a way that did not align with government policies. The audit found that about 8% of the loans paid out from the scheme – a total of about $96m – were not likely to be repaid. About 5% of loans were approved to businesses that were rated as high to severe risk. Other issues raised included that approvals were processed manually, supplier information was not restricted and that payment files were not encrypted. In order to assess, process and pay the increased volume of loans and grants related to government Covid support schemes, the responsible agency, the Queensland Rural and Industry Development Authority, almost doubled its full-time staff. Temporary employees were recruited, taking full-time staff numbers from 118 to 201. “While [the authority] provided training to employees during this period of rapid expansion, it did not adhere to some policies and procedures,” the audit report said. “In addition, the systems and processes [internal controls] it had in place, which were appropriate for a smaller entity, were not adapted as the size, complexity, and risk of the entity increased. “As the government wants to respond quickly to the challenges faced by the community and support businesses in the pandemic, administrators and program owners must ensure that controls can adapt to changes in the nature and volume of services they deliver.” Other issues raised by the auditor general in his annual report on state entities included concerns that government information systems contain weaknesses and need to be better protected from hackers. The report also found that government systems were in some cases susceptible to fraudsters, who would email departments requesting changes to bank account details for suppliers.

This significantly increases the risk of fraud.” The report said that of 10 deficiencies identified related to the rollout of the Covid loan program, eight had already been addressed. The Queensland agricultural industry development minister, Mark Furner, said the department was continuing to work to address the remaining deficiencies. “[The] report provides important lessons on striving for greater transparency within government and protecting public value during times of organisational change,” Furner said.",News/Australia news,"Queensland Covid grants were approved improperly and $96m may not be repaid, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/13/queensland-covid-grants-were-approved-improperly-and-96m-may-not-be-repaid-report-says
4/13/2022,"A Twitter shareholder is suing Elon Musk for failing to disclose that he had bought a substantial stake in the company, affecting share prices. The Tesla CEO revealed on 4 April that he had acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter. Shares in the social media company soared, as investors viewed the move as a vote of confidence from the richest man in the world. However, federal trade laws require that investors notify the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after surpassing a 5% stake in a company within 10 days. Musk acquired his shares on 14 March but did not make that public until 4 April. In the time between passing the 5% threshold and publicly reporting, Musk was able to buy up additional shares at a deflated price, the new lawsuit alleges. Experts estimate that delay may have illegally netted Musk $156m. Filed in a New York federal court on Tuesday, the suit seeks class action status on behalf of investors who sold Twitter stock during that time and lost out on gains they would have realized had Musk disclosed his stake earlier. After Musk disclosed his stake, Twitter shares rose 27% – from $39.31 to $49.97. The plaintiff in the suit sold 35 Twitter shares for $1,373, or an average price of $39.23, before Musk revealed his investments. Jeffrey Block, of the law firm representing the plaintiff, confirmed the suit had been filed as of Tuesday. The lawsuit seeks a jury trial for unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding whether it would also take action against Musk. Musk’s announcement that he had acquired a 9.2% stake – making him the company’s largest shareholder at the time - caused immediate controversy. Many speculated the acquisition could allow Musk, a vocal critic of Twitter, to push the company to make broader changes. Twitter announced on 5 April that Musk would join its board of directors, but on Sunday, Twitter’s CEO, Parag Agrawal, announced abruptly that Musk would not be joining the board after all. By not joining the board, Musk, a prolific Twitter user, can keep buying shares without being bound by his agreement with the company to limit his stake to 14.9%. After the news of the U-turn broke, Musk tweeted and then deleted a hand-over-mouth emoji.

4/13/2022,"Andrew McDonald has been confirmed as the man to lead Australia on upcoming tours to Sri Lanka and India, the T20 World Cup, an away Ashes series and beyond after being officially unveiled as Justin Langer’s replacement as head coach. McDonald had been in the position on an interim basis since Langer stepped down in February, and oversaw the recent tour to Pakistan, where Australia won a tightly contested Test series 1-0, lost a three-match ODI series 2-1 and won a one-off T20. He joined the national setup in 2019 after leading Victoria and the Melbourne Renegades to all three domestic competition titles during the 2018-19 season, and will now take charge of the men’s national side after signing a four-year contract. He inherits a team that has enjoyed substantial recent success with victory in last year’s T20 World Cup followed by a dominant Ashes series win over England. “The journey so far has been particularly pleasing, and I am honoured to be given this incredible opportunity for what is an exciting period ahead,” McDonald said. “The success of the World Cup, the Ashes series and now Pakistan has been testament to the hard work and leadership of Justin [Langer], Pat [Cummins] and Aaron [Finch] along with the players and the support staff. “My plan is to build on the growth, depth and experience of the squad while working collectively with the group and across the game. There are many challenges in the short-term which I know excites the leadership group, the players and the staff.” Cricket Australia interviewed several candidates for the role, which the chief executive, Nick Hockley, said was “one of the most important in Australian sport”. “Andrew has already shown he is an outstanding head coach and the vision he outlined for the role during the appointment process was both impressive and exciting, making him our clear choice,” Hockley said. “We are proud of the way the team played and the respect shown throughout the tour of Pakistan under the leadership of Andrew, Pat and Aaron and really pleased Andrew is taking on the role permanently.” McDonald will take charge of the team across all three formats, although given the scale of that task some white balls series may be overseen by an assistant coach.",Sport/Sport,Cricket Australia appoint Andrew McDonald as men’s head coach,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/13/cricket-australia-appoint-andrew-mcdonald-as-mens-head-coach
4/13/2022,"Joe Biden has accused Russia of carrying out genocide in Ukraine, saying that Vladimir Putin is “trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian”. Biden has been consistently outspoken in denouncing Russian wholesale killing of Ukrainian civilians, labelling Putin as a “war criminal” in mid-March. Multiple investigations are under way into Russian atrocities in Ukraine, which include the razing of Mariupol and the executions of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. The prosecutor at the international criminal court in the Hague opened a case in February saying there was “a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine”. Proving a case under the 1948 Genocide Convention requires an “intent [by the accused] to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. Biden first used the word in passing on Tuesday at a domestic policy event in Iowa about the use of ethanol in petrol. “Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide half a world away,” he said. Questioned later on whether he intended to apply the term to Russians actions in Ukraine, Biden told journalists: “Yes, I called it genocide because it’s become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian. “And the evidence is mounting,” he said. “More evidence is coming out of the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine. And we’re going to only learn more and more about the devastation. We’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me.” His comments were quickly welcomed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who applauded what he called the “true words of a true leader”. “Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil,” Zelenskiy said on Twitter. “We are grateful for US assistance provided so far and we urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities.” Prior to his invasion, Putin described Ukrainian separate existence as illegitimate, as he argued that Russians and Ukrainian were one people. As well as wholesale killing of civilians, Russia has been accused of the forcible transfer of captured Ukrainian civilians into Russia, including large numbers of children, while changing the rules to make it easier for Russian families to adopt them. Determining the line between crimes against humanity and genocide has sometimes proved difficult and divisive. The international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ruled that the slaughter of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica constituted genocide but not the mass killings carried out by Serb forces in other municipalities, a distinction that outraged the populations of the other devastated towns.",News/World news,Joe Biden accuses Vladimir Putin of committing genocide in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/joe-biden-accuses-vladimir-putin-of-committing-genocide-in-ukraine
4/13/2022,"Ifeel a sense of trepidation and fear about the election but there’s still a small part of me that has hope the government we elect will have some compassion for those like me who are living in poverty. We all vote with our best interests in mind. Lower taxes, childcare, aged care and job creation affect a lot of people. But I can’t eat childcare or lower taxes. A strong economy doesn’t pay my bills. The cost of living is on my mind a lot, as it is for other voters. The high price of basic items like food and petrol impacts us all. But for those of us below the poverty line, we can’t just swap out a loaf of bread with a cheaper loaf – we are forced to put the bread back. I’ve been watching both major parties closely and reading each policy that’s released and so far I’m bitterly disappointed that neither party even mentions poverty. Sadly, Labor has decided it won’t commit to an increase in jobseeker or even a review of it. This decision is devastating to people like me. Those of us in poverty knew that Scott Morrison wouldn’t increase the rate –he’s made that clear from the start – so we had pinned our hopes on Labor at least committing to a small increase. We’ve all just been thrown to the wolves. Labor scores slightly higher for its plan to create 20,000 public housing places and its promise to scrap the cashless debit card. But even this doesn’t go far enough because, if you can’t afford rent, a house is no benefit. It seems no one cares about us until the economy needs to be stimulated and then we are used to do it. As soon as it recovers we’re thrown back into poverty. It’s like drowning and being thrown a lifesaver then having that yanked away again, leaving you once again in a sea of bills you can’t afford to pay. So far I feel that both the Liberals and Labor have ignored those of us who are living on welfare and living below the poverty line. It’s not exactly a small problem, with an estimated 2.5 million people and their children relying on these payments. We hear from both sides that “jobs” will be the solution. Yet many jobseekers like myself are disabled, or live in an area they can’t move from, or have caring responsibilities. Just because a job is created doesn’t mean we can work it. So we’re left in soul-crushing poverty. You’re caught in a cycle and, no matter how much you try, your circumstances don’t change. Anthony Albanese talks about his childhood in poverty with a single disabled mother in a council house. I also had a single mum on DSP and lived in public housing. That’s where the parallels stop. The difference is my mum needed me to be her carer so from the age of 12 that’s what I did. I don’t believe Morrison has spent one day of his life wondering how he will be able to afford to eat for the next fortnight or having to worry his electricity will be cut off. Our politicians are out of touch – they have no real idea of the toll that constant stress takes on someone’s body and mental health. When we become hopeless we quit trying. I’d love to see policies brought in to raise welfare payments to the Henderson poverty line, Medicare extended to dental and mental health, more public housing and free education. In that order. Why is the order important? Because being in poverty effects your ability to think and to make long-term decisions. By lifting us out of poverty first you increase our chances of success in taking advantage of education. It’s harder to learn when you’re focused on hunger pains and how you’re going to pay the internet bill so you can study. Poverty is a policy choice and we should be focusing on policies to eradicate it. The savings to Medicare and community would be huge, as more people would be able to take care of their basic needs and reach their full potential. I feel that Labor no longer represents disadvantaged people, as it once did. Albo isn’t Gough Whitlam and refusing to increase the jobseeker rate reinforces that belief. Bob Hawke once said: “By 1990, no Australian child will be living in poverty.” It’s 32 years later and we still have children living in poverty – and Labor has no plans to change that. If Albanese or Morrison won’t speak up for the most vulnerable in society I never want to hear the political slogans “We’re all in this together” or “No one left behind” again. Clearly some voters matter more than others, and a lot of us have been left behind for too long.
