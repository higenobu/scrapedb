1/19/2022,"Tech bulls, the big number to watch today is: 51. If the Nasdaq were to close lower on Wednesday by about 51 points, the tech-heavy index would officially be in correction territory. And, oh what a fall it's been. On Nov. 19, the Nasdaq closed at 16,057.44, an all-time high, only to tumble 9.65% over the past two months. (A market correction amounts to a 10% drop.) How likely are investors to see the dreaded C-word flash across the screen today? It's not looking good. At 4 a.m. ET, the Nasdaq was off roughly 0.8%, and investors in Europe were selling their tech shares yet again. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML, a bellwether for chips stocks, was off nearly 4% in early trading despite reporting a big Q4 profit-beat and a rosy sales full-year sales forecast. Investors dumped shares on fears ASML cannot meet runaway customer demand. There's a confluence of factors buffeting tech stocks. Supply chain bottlenecks are likely to weigh on the chips sector in the near term. Elsewhere, investor jitters over more hawkish central bank policy, plus higher bond yields and rising inflation will be like a gut-punch for cash-tight high-growth tech firms. In the latest BofA Securities fund manager survey, the bank found that big money managers are pulling out of tech at a rate last seen in 2008, during the height of the global financial crisis. In the past month, they loaded up on banks, industrials and energy stocks while they bailed on tech, the investor equivalent of waving the white flag on growth stocks. If history is any judge, the tech sell-off may not hit bottom for a while. According to Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David J. Kostin, in cycles like the one we're about to enter—that is, with the Federal Reserve expected to hike interest rates multiple times in 2022—cyclical sectors (materials, Industrials, energy) tend to do well. ""At the factor level,"" he continues in a recent investor note, ""value stocks tend to outperform in the months before and after the first hike... Growth is the worst performing factor in the 6 months around the first hike."" This is not to say equities are a bad bet in period of rising rates. Dating back to 2004, the S&P 500 has delivered, on average, a 9% return even as rates rise, Goldman found. ""However,"" Kostin writes, ""the current inflation-led hiking cycle may prove more challenging for equities.""

1/19/2022,"Bank of America delivered strong fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday, bucking a trend seen across much of the sector this earnings season.

Despite the slight miss on sales, there was a lot like in Bank of America’s (ticker: BAC) numbers, especially in light of a challenging earnings season for the banks, which saw peers such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) dogged by higher expenses and Goldman Sachs (GS) posting a rare miss on earnings Tuesday.",Business/Barrons.com•1 hour ago,Bank of America Earnings Rise 28% and Top Forecasts.

1/19/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel    NEW YORK (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co was sued for $10 million on Tuesday by a 68-year-old Florida woman who said the carrier ejected her from a flight because she periodically needed to remove her mask to drink water.    Medora Clai Reading said she was wrongly removed from a Jan. 7, 2021, flight to Palm Beach, Florida, from Washington, D.C. after a hostile flight attendant kept demanding that she keep her mask on despite medical issues, including a heart condition and low blood sugar, requiring that she stay hydrated.    Southwest had no immediate comment, having yet to review the complaint.    Reading's lawsuit in federal court in Brooklyn differs from disputes focused on travelers who are unwilling to wear masks.    The Federal Aviation Administration said airline crews in 2021 submitted 5,981 reports of unruly passengers, including 4,290 incidents related to masks.    In her complaint, Reading said that she offered to show the attendant her medical exemption card but was told, ""we don't care,"" and that the attendant objected to her later sipping water by shouting: ""You were talking!""    Reading said a gate attendant eventually ordered her off the flight, as an unmasked pilot ""laughed mockingly"" as she tearfully exited.    She said nearby police helped her to a chair and offered water, while commenting that similar occurrences were ""happening far too often"" and ""it is usually Southwest.""    Kristina Heuser, a lawyer for Reading, in an interview said a ""planeload full of witnesses"" saw the encounter, and some may have videotaped it.    Heuser said Southwest's ""hostile and abusive"" conduct reflected a ""COVID insanity"" that should not override federal laws protecting people with medical disabilities.    Reading's lawsuit alleges violations of the federal Air Carrier Access Act and various civil rights laws.    The flight attendant, two gate officials and the pilot, none of whom is identified by name, are also defendants.    The case is Reading v Southwest Airlines Co et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 22-00265.    (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Howard Goller) ",U.S./Reuters•15 hours ago,"Woman sues Southwest, says airline ejected her for removing mask to drink water",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/woman-sues-southwest-says-airline-223456760.html
