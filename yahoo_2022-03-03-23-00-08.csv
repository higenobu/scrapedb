3/3/2022,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman said he does not care whether U.S. President Joe Biden misunderstood things about him and said the U.S. leader should be thinking about America's interests, in an interview to The Atlantic published Thursday. The de facto ruler of the world's top oil exporter, known as MbS, also warned the United States not to interfere in the internal affairs of the absolute monarchy. ""Simply, I do not care,” he said. It is up to Biden ""to think about the interests of America”, he said when asked whether Biden misunderstood things about him. “We don’t have the right to lecture you in America,” he said. “The same goes the other way.” While the crown prince enjoyed close relations with former President Donald Trump, Biden has taken a tougher stance on the kingdom's human rights record and the Yemen war in which a Saudi-led coalition is engaged since early 2015. Biden's administration released a U.S. intelligence report implicating the crown prince in the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which MbS denies, and pressed for the release of political prisoners. Prince Mohammed told the Atlantic that Riyadh's aim is to maintain and strengthen its ""long, historical"" relationship with America.

3/3/2022,"Several demoralized Russian troops captured in Ukraine were allowed to call home over the weekend to tell their families they were safe and profess confusion about why they were sent to war. ""Mama and Papa, I didn't want to come here. They forced me to,"" a Russian soldier said in videos purporting to show the phone calls that were taken by Ukraine's Interior Ministry and posted on YouTube. Videos and stills of captured or surrendered Russian troops also were posted on the Ukrainian Security Service's Facebook page. The posting of the videos showing captured Russian troops raised questions about whether Ukraine had violated Article 13 of the Geneva Conventions, calling for the protection of prisoners of war ""against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity."" Read Next: Biden to Spotlight Vets Health in Address to Congress, Pushing Burn Pit, Mental Health Help The captured Russian soldiers, and any Ukrainians captured by the Russians, were entitled to humane treatment and protections under the law of war and the Geneva Conventions, said Gary Solis, a Vietnam veteran, retired Marine judge advocate general and author of the book, ""The Law of Armed Conflict."" ""It's a violation"" of Geneva to post the videos, but not what would be considered a ""grave breach"" to be taken up by a war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Solis said. ""Anybody who is captured is a prisoner of war"" and must be shielded from abuse and provided medical treatment as a lawful combatant, he added. ""Clearly, the Russians who were captured were wearing uniforms."" He compared what the Ukrainians had done more to a misdemeanor than a felony, and also noted that there was a positive humanitarian aspect of the videos in showing ""proof of life"" to the families of the captured troops. The International Criminal Court in The Hague has made no mention of Ukrainian actions since Russia invaded last week, but on Monday, ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan said in a press release that he planned to begin an investigation ""as rapidly as possible"" into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russia tied to the bombing and shelling of civilian buildings. In English subtitles added to one video by Ukrainian authorities, another Russian soldier tried to explain his plight to his mother: ""Hello, hello, Mom? Hi, did you recognize me? I am in the territory of Ukraine. I've been taken captive but I'm alright."" In addition to the videos of soldiers calling home, the Interior Ministry showed off-camera interrogators questioning the troops who mostly appeared to be unharmed and speaking freely, but some had cuts and bruises on their faces. One soldier appeared under sheets in what was either an aid station or hospital bed and said ""I got here not knowing"" what the mission was, according to the Ukrainian translation. ""I didn't imagine what will happen here. There was no need to come here."" He said ""our convoy got under fire"" and now ""my legs are broken."" He had a wife and two children back in Russia, the soldier said, and ""I pray to God to recover."" A common theme among the soldiers was that they were conscripts, with little concept of why they were sent into Ukraine and-or what their mission was once they crossed the border. One Russian soldier said: ""We came here under the pretext of doing military exercises. We were not planning to make war on Ukraine. I am alive and healthy as a captive, and my message is to stop the war in Ukraine. It is nonsense; people are dying."" Ukrainian officials gave no overall figure for how many Russian troops may have been captured, but Ukraine's Interior Ministry reported Tuesday that 5,710 Russian troops had been killed since the Feb. 24 invasion began. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov declined Sunday to give numbers on how many Russian troops had been killed or captured but said more Ukrainians than Russians had been killed, Russia's Tass news agency reported. ""There are dead and wounded among our comrades,"" Konashenkov said without giving any figures, but added that Ukraine's losses were ""many times"" more than Russia's -- again without giving specifics. Although they may not be wearing uniforms, the civilians would be considered lawful combatants so long as they were wearing a sign or symbol of their allegiance, and simply carrying a weapon would qualify as such a sign, Solis said.

3/3/2022,"Russian affairs expert Fiona Hill said there is one group of people in particular that Russian President Vladimir Putin “probably has to worry about” more than anyone else if his invasion of Ukraine doesn’t go as planned. It’s not Russia’s obscenely rich oligarchs, who face economic sanctions and seizures of their assets worldwide, the former top analyst on the National Security Council told Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Late Show.” Instead, it’s the “very small circle” — such as Russia’s heads of intelligence, military and security services — who cooked up the invasion plan with Putin, said Hill. “These are not the kind of guys who have yachts off Monaco, palaces in Paris or anything like this,” Hill explained. “These are people who are very much rooted in Russia itself and I don’t think they’re too worried about all of these sanctions and everything that’s cut off, because they’re not invested in the West. They’ve really got that bunker siege mentality — fortress Russia.” Members of this small circle are who Putin “probably does have to worry about” if “it looks like Russia is losing,” said Hill, an intelligence analyst under former President George W. Bush and Barack Obama who later served on the National Security Council under Donald Trump. Hill was an important witness during Trump’s first impeachment. “I don’t think they care about the world of public opinion,” Hill added. “But if there’s not any movement on the ground, if that great convoy of tanks just basically runs out of gas and is just left there, and if they have to kind of lay waste to Ukraine to basically get a success … you might then start to get a backlash from those people who are thinking this has not gone as they intended.” Watch the interview here: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/3/2022,"This story has been updated with new information from the Pentagon and United Nations. Ukraine armed forces have been striking that long line of Russian troops heading to Kyiv while the Russians have used thermobaric weapons against Ukrainian cities, the head of Ukraine’s defense intelligence agency tells Military Times. “We are striking the enemy’s columns,” Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told Military Times in an exclusive interview Wednesday morning. “We burn many columns of the enemy.” The strikes, he said, are being conducted by Ukraine Su-24 and Su-25 fighter jets, artillery and missile barrages. “My intelligence officers and agents are directing and calling the strikes,” he said. Marine Lt. Col. Anton Semelroth, a Pentagon spokesman said Wednesday morning he “would not speak to intel assessments.” Speaking to reporters Wednesday afternoon on the condition of anonymity, a senior defense official said the Pentagon has indications Ukraine forces are targeting the convoy in an attempt to stymie what officials believe is Russia’s ultimate goal: to occupy Kyiv and install a puppet government. The official spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity. [Ukraine jets hit Russian column; Russia has used thermobarics, Ukraine military says] “We’ve seen indications that at times and at certain places, the convoys may have been resisted by Ukrainian forces and I think I have to leave it at that,” the official said. “But we’ve seen indications that we are in no position to refute [Ukraine claims they have hit the convoy].” Ukraine invasion live updates: March 2 The Russian troops staged around the outside of Ukraine’s capital city appear to be in a holding pattern of some kind, a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Tuesday. Formations that had been moving toward Kyiv are essentially in the same spot today as they were Monday, the official said, roughly 17 miles outside the city center. “We believe that that’s for a number of reasons,” the official said. “Obviously, the resistance that they’re facing, the fuel and sustainment problems that they’re having. We are also picking up signs that they’re having problems feeding their troops, that they’re not only running out of gas, but they are running out of food.” The Pentagon’s assessment echoes multiple reports from recent days that Russian troops are looking for fuel and sustenance as they roll toward Kyiv. There’s also the possibility, the official said, that the Russians are taking a strategic pause to regroup, possibly after a stiffer defense than anticipated from the Ukrainian armed forces. Budanov also told Military Times that the Russians have been using thermobaric weapons in the assault on Kharkiv and near Kyiv. They were fired, he said, by TOS-1M weapons systems. Thermobaric weapons produce more heat and overpressure than conventional weapons by exploding a vapor in the blast zone, according to the Journal of Military and Veterans’ Health. Such weapons create tremendous damage to the human body, according to the journal. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately return a request seeking comment on both claims by Budanov. Human Rights Watch condemned Russia’s reported used of the weapons a year earlier in Chechnya in 2000, according to The Guardian, as “a dangerous escalation” with “important humanitarian implications”. The Guardian described the weapons as effective at their “specific purpose” of “primarily destroying defensive positions.” While they would not be used to penetrate a tank, they could be a “”very destructive weapon” against an apartment complex or other building. “They are not illegal, even though their effects can be pretty horrific because of … creating a vacuum and sucking the air out of the lungs of defenders,” Marcus Hellyer, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told The Guardian. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. envoy to the United Nations, confirmed the Russians have used thermobaric weapons, also known as vacuum bombs. “We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine which has no place on the battlefield,” the U.S. envoy to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the General Assembly, according to The Hill. “That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs, which are banned under the Geneva Convention.” She echoed allegations made on Monday — by Ukraine’s Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova to American lawmakers — that Russia was using in its attacks on Ukraine a thermobaric weapon, according to The Hill. A senior U.S. defense official on Tuesday said the Pentagon has seen weapons systems that can launch themobaric weapons inside Ukraine, but could not confirm the thermobaric weapons are actually in Ukraine or their use. Semelroth on Wednesday told Military Times there was no update to that assessment. That official on Wednesday “had nothing more to add.” Military Times Pentagon Bureau Chief Meghann Myers contributed to this report.",World/Air Force Times,"Ukraine jets hit Russian column; Russia has used thermobarics, Ukraine military says",https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-jets-hit-russian-column-131510676.html
3/3/2022,"Sanctions against Russia and its oligarchs have been implemented by several countries. A Russian billionaire had his yacht seized by German authorities Wednesday, according to Forbes. Alisher Usmanov has spoken highly of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past. Germany seized Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov's mega-yacht on Wednesday, according to Forbes, which cited multiple unnamed sources. Usmanov's yacht, which has been docked in Hamburg, Germany, for months for a refitting, is the first to be seized since Russia's attack on Ukraine began on February 24. Dilbar, a 512-foot yacht that weighs 15,917 tons, ""is the largest motor yacht in the world by gross tonnage,"" according to Lürssen, the German ship's maker. Usmanov bought the custom-built yacht for an estimated $600 million and it took 52 months to build, according to Forbes. David Satter is a US journalist who spent decades covering Russian politics before he was expelled from the country after claiming that President Putin and the FSB may have been involved with the deadly Russia apartment bombings in 1999. The US State Department was unable to confirm to Insider if the yacht was indeed seized. Usmanov and Germany's Federal Foreign Office did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Many countries, including the US and the European Union, have implemented sanctions — financial consequences applied by one party to another — against Russian banks, Russian oligarchs, and even Russian President Vladimir Putin, in an effort to end the country's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Usmanov's assets were frozen as part of sanctions levied by the European Union, according to the Guardian. After the European Union announced sanctions against Usmanov and other Russian oligarchs, he stepped down as President of the International Fencing Federation, one of his companies. ""I believe that such a decision is unfair, and the reasons employed to justify the sanctions are a set of false and defamatory allegations damaging my honor, dignity, and business reputation,"" Usmanov said in a statement on the company's website. ""I hereby suspend the exercise of my duties as the President of the International Fencing Federation effective immediately until justice is restored,"" he added. The oligarch has historically supported Russian President Vladimir Putin, though he has not commented on the current attack on Ukraine. ""I am proud that I know Putin, and the fact that everybody does not like him is not Putin's problem,"" the Uzbekistan-born oligarch told Forbes in a 2010 interview.
