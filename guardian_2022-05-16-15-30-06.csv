5/16/2022,"What do you call an engaged toilet on a Jumbo jet? A HYPOTENUSE! The Theory of Relativity in a nutshell – time spent with your relatives seems longer. Don’t knock innumeracy; my girlfriend is innumerate and we have wonderful threesomes. These one-liners are hand-picked classics from Des MacHale, a legend in the world of mathematical humour. Emeritus professor of maths at University College, Cork, he is the author of more than 70 books, mostly of maths, puzzles and jokes. MacHale has selected today’s puzzles, below. The first four are standard word or number conundrums, while the remaining five are lateral thinking puzzles, a MacHale speciality and a crowd-pleasing genre I feature too infrequently in this column. Some require you to think like a novelist, conjuring up a believable situation that results in the relevant scenario. Others are misleading you by presenting a word or phrase that can be interpreted in more than one way. Take note. 1. A rich woman dies and leaves her entire fortune of two million pounds between a number of lion tamers. How much did each lion tamer receive? 2. Punctuate this sentence to reverse its meaning: A SMART DOG KNOWS ITS MASTER. 3. What is never odd or even? 4. Make this equation correct just by moving the digits about: 26 = 74. 5. Two objects perform the same task. One has many thousands of moving parts while the other has no moving parts. What are they? 6. Why did a person buy an object they didn’t want for £1 and throw it away a few minutes later? 7. Why did a man tighten the lids on all the jars in his house and put them in the fridge? 8. In a locked cabin high up on the side of a mountain, five dead bodies are found. How had they all died? 9. Why was a person standing at a bus stop with an ordinary kitchen chair in their arms? I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solutions. Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS! Instead, please discuss your favourite lateral thinking puzzles and post your favourite mathematical jokes. Des MacHale is an algebraist, with more than 100 academic papers in refereed journals. Yet he gained fame early in his career as a humorist. In 1976 he wrote the Book of Kerryman Jokes, which went on to sell half a million copies in Ireland. He has written many other joke books, including a compendium of Boris Johnson jokes. His prolific output also includes four books on the Irish mathematician George Boole, and many books of puzzles. MacHale’s two main interests – maths and humour – merge in his most recent book, Comic Sections Plus, an updated edition of his classic book of mathematical wit. “I would have humour lessons in all schools,” he says. “Logic and riddles are basic links between mathematics and humour; mathematics is ultra logical and humour turns logic on its head.” His 20 books of lateral thinking puzzles are co-written with Paul Sloane. “I am hopeless at solving them but good I think at making them up,” he says. “Everybody enjoys logical thinking and being the first to get a solution.” On that note, how are you all getting on…? Thanks to Des MacHale for today’s puzzles. You can buy his magnum opus Comic Sections Plus : the Book of Mathematical Jokes, Humour, Wit and Wisdom here. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me.

5/16/2022,"Marian Elliott was 22 when she left the family home to be with her husband-to-be. So when he left her nearly 40 years later – shortly after her 60th birthday – she found herself living entirely alone for the first time. Elliott had thought she could picture the next stage in her life. She and her ex had worked hard to pay off their mortgage. “We were about to enjoy our retirement together,” she says with a heavy sigh. Now there was nothing but uncertainty. “I felt such pain, I didn’t know what to do with it,” she says. For Elliott, “a marriage broken up by the other person is like a bereavement”, and the grief she felt revived another sorrow that she had been unable fully to face. When she was 20, her father died of stomach cancer. “I have suffered from depression ever since,” she says. “It doesn’t take much, and whoosh! – it all comes back.” Her father was unaware that his illness was terminal, though Elliott knew, and she never had a chance to say goodbye, nor to share a “meaningful conversation” with him before he died. Within a year, her then boyfriend also died of stomach cancer. “There’s only so much you can talk about in terms of grief at that age, I think. People don’t know what to do with you,” she says. It was in this context that she became friends with the man who would become her husband. It was only after her marriage ended that Elliott embarked on counselling, at the suggestion of her doctor, and began to understand her bouts of depression. “You kind of bury these things. It does help, understanding where all this comes from.” When she first set up her marital home, her overwhelming sensation was of “freedom”. She hand-sewed kaftans for herself and her partner, cooked what she wanted to eat, and together they hung wallpaper and built bookshelves. But when she bought her own place for the first time at 64, and moved from Surrey to the Kent coast, she had to face a totally new kind of freedom, one that was offset by a solitary responsibility and sometimes acute loneliness. In her despair, she reached for some positives. “I thought: ‘I’ve always wanted to be by the sea,’” she says, and now she was. And she was finally able to get the dog she had long wanted. One of her greatest joys is walking Ruby, her rescue lurcher/collie cross, along the beach. “We like that,” she says. “It’s been nine years since all this started falling apart. And I come home and I look at my front door and think: ‘That is my front door. No one can take that away from me, ever.’ On the other hand, once I’m through the door, I am on my own and that is still hard.” She already knew of u3a – AKA the University of the Third Age, whose motto is “learn, laugh, live” – but she had always been too busy to sign up. Now, she looked up her local branch. “I knew I needed people. They have somebody on the door. If you look a bit lost, they say: ‘Have you been here before? Oh, I’ll sit you down with somebody’ … By the time you walk out of that first session, it’s like you’ve been there for ever. “Your confidence builds up. You get to walk through another door. A bit worried, but you do it.” Now, Elliott attends the Spanish, family history, creative writing and gardening groups (most of her new flower bed has been stocked with the help of her “generous and kind-hearted” friends); she also sits on the committee, organises AGMs and hosts coffee mornings. Life is not how she envisaged it nine years ago, but her new friends “are showing me that there is still lots for me to enjoy and do. They have enabled me, through their friendliness, to make a new life all by myself. And that’s quite an empowering feeling.” u3a is a national learning organisation in which people come together to develop their interests, make new friends and have fun.

5/16/2022,"I have a job which often requires me to eat more than a human being probably should; 2,000 calories in one meal is quite normal – lots of butter, sugar, fat, cream – all the things that make things taste delicious. I realised early on in this game that I could only do it if I ate quite sparsely the rest of the time. I really watch what I put into my body now. I’ve realised that, fFrom your mid-40s, everything you eat and drink shows in your face. You becomeget hammered on a G&T and feel awful dayafter a late-night Burger King. I went teetotal about nine months ago. I had been drinking in a very British way since I was 14. I wouldn’t have said I had an alcohol problem– I didn’t binge or drink secretly – but I began as a teenager in a field, then moved on to student bars, dinner parties, the media industry, and then to reviewing restaurants where endless drinks are on offer. I grew sick of losing bits of life to feeling shit. So I just stopped completely. My skin looked radically different right away. When I go out now, I usually have a shrub or booze-free aperitif. I skip breakfast a lot – often, it’s just a litre of coffee with oat milk –– and I eat lots of protein at lunch, eggs in any form, a block of tofu I’ll have marinated and baked, lots of nuts and dried fruit. And I roast loads of vegetables: broccoli is a favourite. I eat like a wild animal – apart from the meat. I drive my man mad. His idea of joy is cooking half a cow three different ways. I’m more of an ape; I love vegan food. Whenever I talk about loving vegan food, it starts a backlash. The vegans aren’t happy with me because I’m not fully vegan and the meat eaters say I’m trying to destroy the farming industry. Any nuance seems to get lost. It does seem to fascinate people, though, that I’m a food critic who doesn’t love foie gras. Stereotypically, those guys love a kidney, bone marrow, sweetbreads. Not me. One of the reasons I have trouble with meat is I’m a massive animal lover. My dream is to go full Celia Hammond and have a little animal sanctuary, at which point I will stop wearing a bra and ditch the false eyelashes. I am uncomfortable with killing animals. My freezer always has veggie burgers in it. I don’t think you should eat them every day, but they’re really handy. I don’t get the anger about Linda McCartney-style foods – there are far worse things. People ask: “Why do you want a burger if it’s not a burger?” But what don’t they understand? When you have a beef burger, you don’t just want the patty – you want the lovely bun and the butter and the sauce and the chips and the salad. Who cares what the patty is, as long as it tastes peppery and herby and has that mouthfeel? There are a few go-to cookbooks on my shelves. I love Nigel Slater because his recipes are more like suggestions: he ruminates rather than prescribes. And I bloody love Nigella; How to Be a Domestic Goddess is my most destroyed book. Also Ottolenghi Simple, Emma Spitzer’s Fress, which is full of bright, bold Jewish flavours, and Cooking Like Mummyji by Vicky Bhogal. This book taught me how to make Indian food with everyday British ingredients. When I eat out or get takeaway, I usually go for spice. I order loads from Wanstead Kitchen, an Indian cafe near where I live, which I hope I don’t regret telling you about (one Christmas Day, when I was working on Radio 2, I had a massive Hyderabadi biryani and iftari kala chana, a black chickpea curry, from them – heaven). You’ll often see me in the Wagamama in Westfield Stratford during the day, eating bang bang cauliflower, which is one of the hottest things on a mainstream British menu. And Tonkotsu: I love their ramen, and I really love Eat the Bits, their chilli sauce, which I’ve taken to eating simply with bread and butter. The British palate has veered towards chilli sauce en masse. It’s become bog-standard to crave a blast of it. Ten years ago, ketchup was the condiment in every shopping trolley, but I think the likes of Blue Dragon sweet chilli sauce and sriracha are up there now. British communities come together in unity through some foods. I grew up eating very simply. I lived in Currock, a suburb of Carlisle, in a little terraced house. Food was whatever came from the tiny supermarket down the road. My mum did cook – hotpots, stews, fairy cakes – but my most exciting meals were tinned. I still feel the love from a tin of macaroni cheese, ravioli, baked beans. I have strong memories of coming home from school and watching Pipkins with half a tin of Heinz tomato soup and some white bread toast spread with Dairylea. Absolute happiness. When I moved to London, I lived in Bounds Green. I was surrounded by Greek and Turkish restaurants along Myddleton Road, properIrish pubs, Korean and Vietnamese food, neither of which I’d known existed. It was like I’d only seen the world in black and white until that point. It was tThe food that kept me in London. The house prices are good in Carlisle but you can’t get very good sushi. I used to read Winner’s Dinners in the Sunday Times and think: “I could do that.” People like me didn’t really review restaurants, though, and I didn’t have an in. But from my early days in London, I loved the different scenes in restaurants and when people asked me what a place was like, I’d tell them to pull up a chair. They’d know exactly what I was talking about from my explanation. I can’t say I learned my love of food from childhood holidays in Tuscany, but I know people liked hearing from me on the matter. I’ve spent the last few months eating my way around the British coastline with Ainsley Harriott. In each place we visited, wWe sampled the whole spectrum of the food on offer. One moment I was eating in an Agatha Christie-style hotel, the next Ainsley and I were loading sugar into a giant machine to make rhubarb and custard sweets. It reminded me how much I love Great Britain, blustery beaches and seaside food. Because what’s better than being on an isolated beach and eating chips cooked in beef dripping from a kiosk?

5/16/2022,"It sounds obvious but it is worth asking yourself why you want to sell your house and whether you will achieve what you want from the sale. Simon Shinerock, the chair of Choices Estate Agency, says it is worth checking out the area you want to move to and speaking to a mortgage broker to make sure you can get the finance for your next purchase. “Think about your linked purchase – will it dovetail [with your move]? Are you willing to move into rented accommodation if it doesn’t?” Shinerock says. These are all things that could determine how you feel about an offer from a buyer later. As soon as you have decided to sell, you should work on making sure your home looks as presentable as possible – even before you invite an estate agent in. “We’re all people, and if I’m going round and looking at a place and working out how easy it will be to sell and how much it will go for, then my perception of your property will affect that,” Shinerock says. “I wouldn’t invite anyone round to my house without first attending to it.” He says “people will buy what they see” – would-be buyers want to be shown a property they can mentally move into straight away. A tidy appearance to the front of your home doesn’t just include tidying up the garden or weeding the pathway, says Sanel Konyar, an interior designer who runs Interior Kollection. “It also applies to your front door and any accessories you add surrounding this first point of contact with potential buyers.” Repainting a tired-looking front door is a good start, as is mending a broken gate – anything that looks in need of fixing could be noted by a potential buyer as a hassle or expense they could do without. “If your outdoor mat looks like it has seen better days, remove and replace. This is an easy and cheap way to improve a buyer’s first glance yet is so often overlooked,” Konyar says. “If your front door features glass panels or a porch with glass before your front door, ensure that the hallway is clutter-free and boots and shoes are tidied away.” Talk to local estate agents and see if they will give you a quote for what the property is worth and their commission. A good place to start when picking an agent is recommendations from friends who have moved recently. See which companies have lots of boards (saying sold as well as for sale). You can use property websites such as Zoopla and Rightmove to get an insight into which agents are successfully selling homes near you – tick sold in your search to see these. Make contact and arrange to get an appraisal of your home. Once you have spoken to several estate agents you need to choose which one to go with. Compare their commission, sales success, valuation and where they advertise. You might choose the one you liked best – having a good rapport is important – or your decision might be based on the price or their recent success rate. If you like one agent but have been offered a better commission or shorter contract by another firm, don’t be afraid to ask your favoured person if they can match it. Agents are often willing to negotiate – especially when there are more buyers around than there are homes on the market. When you get an offer, your buyer’s solicitor will ask for all kinds of paperwork – you can prevent any hold-ups later by making sure you can put your hands on it now. Alex Lyle of the estate agency Antony Roberts says there’s a long list of things you should try to get ready, including proof of ID, as well as documents linked to any work you have had done on your property. Building regulations approval, planning permissions, Fensa certificates for replacement windows and doors, and a safety certificate for any new boiler are among the paperwork you will need to show – so pull them together now. Doing so gives you the chance to check there are no outstanding issues that need sorting out. Lyle says: “Too often, properties go under offer and then there’s an unnecessary delay in anything further happening. Usually, this is due to the vendor having not instructed a solicitor, or the solicitor has been instructed but doesn’t have the necessary information to provide to the buyer’s solicitor.” Clare Andrews, a residential property partner at the law firm Moore Barlow, says there are practical advantages to acting early. “In a competitive market, appointing a solicitor as soon as you can, not only sends a clear message out to potential buyers that you’re ready to proceed without delay, but gives your solicitor time to review the title deeds and iron out anything that could cause a problem in the transaction.” There is no harm in researching and choosing a solicitor to do your conveyancing before your property is on the market. Again, recommendations from friends are the best start. Otherwise, you can use the Law Society website to find a property specialist and check out reviews for the ones nearby. You will probably have an idea of what you want to raise from the sale – maybe based on what you have seen other properties go for in your neighbourhood. Shinerock says this may be useful “if you live on a road where there are lots of generic properties changing hands regularly” but if your home is at all different from those of your neighbours, you could be misled. Think about what the agents have suggested but bear in mind that some work on high turnover, so will underprice to sell fast – but that won’t get you top dollar. Starting too high is a danger as being forced to reduce the price on your property can give potential buyers the impression that something is wrong with your home. Lyle says you should not get carried away when deciding what to ask for: “It’s better to come on to the market slightly lower, attract more interest, and let people bid each other up to your desired price feeling like they’ve really won it.” Keep inside as clutter-free as you can for the agent’s photos and viewings. Samantha Agbontaen, the founder of Housedesigner.net, says sellers should avoid having too much furniture “and drastically reducing free space available for walking”. Your house will feel bigger if people can move around without having to squeeze past your belongings, so it could be worth putting some things in storage. If you have a loft or watertight shed you can stash things there. If not, it may be worth paying for storage for a few weeks to maximise the price you get for your home. “If your home is too minimalist, this can make it feel clinical and uninviting to potential buyers,” Konyar says. She suggests using throws, cushions and rugs to make sure it feels like a home. Think about who might buy your house and whether your decor will appeal to them. If you are planning to repaint any rooms, go for neutral colours and use accessories to add a bit of character.",Lifestyle/Money,How to get your home ready to sell and get the best price,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/16/how-to-get-your-home-ready-to-sell-best-price-property
5/16/2022,"In 1907, Ella Gwendoline (“Gwen”) Rees Williams sailed to England from Dominica, the Caribbean island of her birth, to attend school in Cambridge. Gwen, who was 16, had long dreamed of the motherland, but from the moment she landed at Southampton, her mood began to darken. If London, her first stop, was sooty and drab and populated by permanently indignant landladies, school was little better. She was mocked for her lilting accent by her classmates, who took particular pleasure in the fact that the maniac who is Mrs Rochester in Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre was a white Creole just like her. On Saturdays, she would cycle to the house of a kindly great aunt. Even there, though, the atmosphere was cautionary. Her aunt told her that she’d once been planning to leave her husband for a lover – until, that is, she looked in the mirror and saw the devil leering over her shoulder. Did the devil ever perch on Gwen’s shoulder? Read Miranda Seymour’s slyly compelling new biography of Jean Rhys – the pen name was adopted in 1924, at the behest of her patron, Ford Madox Ford – and you will feel that it surely did, usually more than once a year. Unlike her aunt, however, she was not one to turn from temptation. The author of Voyage in the Dark and Good Morning, Midnight was all feeling: a human bagatelle ball whizzing from one crisis to another, lured not only by all the usual siren songs (men, money, booze), but by any number of other, less appealing tunes (“disaster is her element,” said her last editor, Diana Athill). Was she, to use the old word, mad? Sometimes, perhaps. But if so, she was hardly alone. I Used to Live Here Once – the biography takes its brilliantly apt title from one of Rhys’s ghost stories – is shot through with madness. Half its cast are half crazy, and most of the rest are as creepy as hell. Liars and fraudsters, bigamists and bolters, grifters and gropers: they’re all here, though Seymour has a special line (because her subject attracted them) in the kind of literary stalker whose pulse races furtively at the sight of an old woman with a bad wig, a whisky habit and (just perhaps) a half-finished manuscript in a drawer. The die for all this was cast in Rhys’s childhood on the island that inspired her 1966 Jane Eyre prequel, Wide Sargasso Sea. By then a British colony, of its population of 29,000, fewer than 100 were white (her mother, who whipped her until she was 12, was Creole; her father was a Welshman), and she always felt like an outsider, “a changeling, a ghostly revenant”. Dominica was not an entirely hospitable place for a girl like her, taunted on the streets, felt up at home. Voodoo was practised, and Rhys’s nursemaid spoke of zombies that could open any door – stories that foreshadow the final years of her life when, figuratively speaking, reanimated corpses were indeed all around, and she was persecuted as a witch by the children in her Devon village. After school, she became an actor; she once played a hen, laying her egg to the disconcerting thump of the clogs of the dissatisfied miners watching. But her lack of talent meant that she was soon in need of a protector. Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith set her up in a flat, and later paid for an abortion. But if he was never going to marry her, those who eventually did were never going to be as reliable as him. Her Belgian first husband, Jean Lenglet, married her bigamously. Her second, Leslie Tilden-Smith, died suddenly. Her third, Max Hamer, was sent to prison for fraud. Rhys had two children with Lenglet. The first, a son, died as a baby while she was out drinking. The second, a daughter, was at first sent by her broke, itinerant parents to an orphanage. Meanwhile, the poky, rat-infested places she called home – suburban bungalows with deceptively charming names – grew ever worse and so did her behaviour. She slapped other tenants, shouted antisemitic insults and abused the kindness of those who cared for her. All this is exhausting to read about: quite how she managed to write anything at all is a mystery. But somehow, she did. Rhys’s career divides in two. Encouraged by Ford, with whom she had an affair, she published her first novel, Quartet, in 1928. Others followed, but after dismal reviews for Good Morning, Midnight in 1939, she was silent for 30 years. She was only saved by her ardent fans: Francis Wyndham, then working at Andre Deutsch, and his colleague, Diana Athill, who between them – with assistance from a priest who’d previously been chaplain to an asylum – teased Wide Sargasso Sea out of her. Some readers will relish it when Rhys is to be found in Paris, hanging out with notable bohemians. But it’s the second half of the book, in which she is old and “potty” and half-cut, that is Seymour’s triumph. The narrative has the tension of a thriller as Rhys struggles to finish Wide Sargasso Sea, and once she has been rediscovered, there are the shabby hotels she haunts; the jaunts with Sonia Orwell and Diana Melly; the literary hangers-on who call for tea. Here is the poet Al Alvarez flirting with her, and here is the memoirist David Plante preparing to stitch her up (the portrait of a sodden Rhys in his book Difficult Women is among the most chilling things I’ve ever read). You cannot work her out: the violent ingratitude, the fondness for Ronnie Corbett, the fact that she has read George Moore’s dreadful 1894 novel Esther Waters 60 times. And yet Seymour does not make the mistake of portraying her as a victim (Rhys died in 1979, aged 88). However precarious her existence, as she appears in this biography Rhys always maintains an obscure dominion, if not over herself, then over other people. Her intransigence, capriciousness and abiding selfishness may not be pretty, but it’s these qualities that kept her going against all the odds.

5/16/2022,"Administrators for the collapsed rent-to-own firm BrightHouse, which specialised in loans for big-ticket items such as fridges and sofas, have warned they will not have enough money to compensate thousands of customers who were left with unaffordable debts. The latest report from the accountants Grant Thornton, which is managing the administration, shows a plan to set aside £600,000 for payouts to customers who may have been mis-sold expensive loans by BrightHouse has been scrapped. Meanwhile, a number of creditors have received large sums. They include the supply chain finance firm Greensill, which is itself in administration after collapsing last year. Greensill – or its creditors – have received nearly £31m. The process will raise fresh questions about how UK insolvency rules prioritise payouts for investors and lenders over customers. Before it went bust in 2020, BrightHouse offered high-interest rent-to-own contracts to customers who would otherwise struggle to afford the upfront costs of household goods such as fridges, ovens, TVs and sofas. It charged interest of up to 69.9%, which, on top of service and insurance fees, could mean customers were paying two to three times the cost of the item on the high street. Some customers were never able to own the goods if they fell behind on payments. BrightHouse customers were typically from low-income households receiving state benefits. The decision means some of the UK’s most vulnerable consumers could be missing out on crucial funds, just as the cost of living crisis squeezes finances. Grant Thornton originally set aside up to £600,000 to deal with more than 11,000 affordability claims from customers who fear they may have been mis-sold loans. But its latest report, published in late April, reveals that the administrators plan to seek court permission to scrap the compensation pot after deciding that the cost would be too high. “Given the likely significant volume and complexity of customers’ affordability claims … it is the administrators’ expectation that the cost associated with assessing these claims would far exceed the funds available for distribution,” the report said. “As a result of the above, the administrators are seeking to make an application to the court in the coming period to seek to disapply the prescribed part,” it added. Under the original plans, customers would have been due refunds for fees and interest, as well as an additional 8% interest on that sum dating back to the start of their loan. Meanwhile, administrators confirmed they had hired a debt collection agency to “improve” repayments from customers and “maximise” payouts for creditors. Those creditors have included Greensill Capital, whose collapse last year sparked a wave of political scandals. Greensill, which specialised in offering advances on company invoices for a fee, issued loans to BrightHouse in 2018. As a lender, Greensill was counted as a secured creditor, putting it at the front of the queue for repayment when its customer, BrightHouse, went bust. The administrators’ report confirmed that Greensill was repaid in full, receiving a total of £30.86m in 2020 – a year before it collapsed into administration. Sara Williams, a debt adviser and author of the Debt Camel blog, said: “The hundreds of thousands of customers who should have had a refund for unaffordable lending will receive nothing. The money that customers have been pushed into paying during the administration is all going to the secured creditors.” She added: “The government and the Insolvency Service need to change this. The customers are the innocent victims here and they should be given priority. Administrators should not seek to collect debts without considering first if the loan was mis-sold.” The issue is particularly acute for customers of rent-to-own firms, who are typically young, female, or single parents, living in rented accommodation.

5/16/2022,"Anthony Albanese has accused the government of “playing politics” with national security after revelations it kept Labor in the dark about the Aukus agreement despite Washington’s desire for bipartisan support. The West Australian premier, Mark McGowan, has also criticised the Coalition for its rhetoric about a Chinese spy ship off the coast of WA last week, alleging that the defence minister, Peter Dutton, was “the biggest threat to national security”. The comments intensify the political dispute over national security with less than a week to polling day. The Nine newspapers reported on the weekend that Labor was only briefed about the Aukus security partnership the day before it was made public last September, despite the US making clear in negotiations that it wanted enduring bipartisan backing for the deal given it would be a decades-long endeavour. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, reportedly assured the Americans that Labor would be supportive of the deal based on his assessment of the political dynamics, but Labor has cried foul, saying it should have been brought into the tent earlier. “Even though Labor could not have been more clear, more decisive, or more certain about our support for Aukus, this prime minister has continued to play politics,” Albanese said.“The US administration, the information is out there, that they expected Labor to be briefed because this is an issue that doesn’t go for a year or a term of parliament,” Albanese said. He rejected suggestions that the top-secret nature of the agreement, which gives Australia access to US nuclear-powered submarine technology for the first time, precluded bipartisan discussions, saying Labor had “national security briefings all the time.” “What this prime minister always does is put the political interests first before the national interest. It’s always about the politics,” Albanese said. But Morrison on Monday defended the Coalition’s handling of negotiations, saying he wasn’t going to risk sharing the details with Labor until the deal was finalised. He noted that ultimately the agreement had secured bipartisan support. “This was a process that, for 18 months, painstakingly working through incredible detail, incredibly sensitive issues, highly confidential. This wasn’t something I was going to be loose with,” he said. “Aukus is a groundbreaking agreement, the most significant defence security agreement Australia has entered into in over 70 years. And I was not going to risk that on the Labor party.” He also rejected suggestions that Australia had defied the US in not including Labor in earlier discussions, saying the government had “absolutely complied with all of the issues that needed to be addressed in forming that partnership”. “We understood absolutely what the requirements were and we met them 100 per cent,” he said. “I find it passing strange that you think we wouldn’t have maintained the absolute discretion, as we did with so many of our own cabinet.”“I mean, we’ve only seen it highlighted over the course of the last couple of weeks – you’ve got the deputy leader of the Labor party [Richard Marles], who would have been sitting in such a briefing, who had, you know, frequent flyer points for visiting the Chinese embassy in Australia.” The Australian newspaper has reported that Marles has held 10 meetings with the Chinese embassy or officials in the past five years. However, the same article noted Marles had held “29 meetings with US embassy officials over the time he had 10 with Chinese officials”. Marles rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing, accusing the government of embarking on a “pretty desperate” attempt to distract from its own failures. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning McGowan on Monday claimed Dutton and Morrison were whipping up fear for votes at the election, blasting them for “inflammatory” language around the way a Chinese spy ship’s presence was announced on Friday. “All this rhetoric by Mr Dutton is just politics. His language around war and around ‘we’ve got to be prepared to fight’, all this sort of stuff that’s gone on for the last year is highly dangerous, and it’s against the national interest,” the Labor premier said. “It’s inflammatory, and unnecessary. And I just think he’s, you know, he’s the biggest threat to national security.” Asked about the Chinese surveillance vessel, which had been travelling through parts of Australia’s exclusive economic zone for a week before Dutton announced its presence and called it “an aggressive act”, McGowan didn’t hold back. “They’ve known about this for a week or so they’ve got the information out there. Mr Dutton is just trying to stir up fear and all that sort of things from boats. That’s what’s going on,” McGowan said. McGowan said he didn’t know about the ship’s presence until after Dutton’s press conference. He noted he had been a navy legal officer before entering politics, and that ships transiting through other nations’ EEZ was not uncommon. “United States, Australia, Britain, we send ships up into other countries exclusive economic zones. If we’re going to allege it’s an aggressive act, other countries can allege that about us,” McGowan said. “I just think we need to be very careful about language on these things, because otherwise, you’re essentially giving other countries the opportunity to say the same thing about us when we send ships through other countries exclusive economic zones, including China.” In a press conference in Perth on Friday, Dutton said Australians “deserve to know what is taking place” and said the public understood “the reality of the Indo-Pacific at the moment, the acts of aggression from the Chinese leadership and from the Chinese government”. Dutton said the ship was “hugging the coastline as it goes north and its intention will be to collect as much electronic intelligence as it can”. He said the ship had been “in close proximity to military and intelligence installations on the west coast of Australia.”",News/Australia news,Labor accuses Coalition of ‘playing politics’ with national security after reports of Aukus snub,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/labor-accuses-coalition-of-playing-politics-with-national-security-after-reports-of-aukus-snub
5/16/2022,"So housing affordability has taken centre stage in the campaign. And would you believe it, the policy is designed around pumping up demand rather than addressing supply. As economist Saul Eslake has noted, pretty much every major housing affordability policy going back to the 1960s has been about pumping up demand. This has especially been the case since 2000 and the John Howard years, when he was infamously quoted in 2003 saying “I don’t get people stopping me in the street and saying, ‘John you’re outrageous, under your government the value of my house has increased’.” And has pumping up demand worked to improve housing affordability? Well, no: If the graph does not display click here So what can we do that won’t drive up housing prices? Look, I know this is not going to happen, but that does not mean it should still not be pursued. A major issue with the housing market is that owner-occupiers are at a disadvantage to investors because the taxation system is skewed towards investors through two things – negative gearing and the capital gains 50% discount. Negative gearing was really just a few embers in the housing market – what caused it to turn into a bonfire was when John Howard poured petrol on it by changing how capital gains were discounted. The introduction of the 50% discount not only caused a massive surge in the level of capital gains but also the amount of rental income that was now a loss: If the graph does not display click here If negative gearing is too tough to touch, then the treatment of capital gains needs to be reformed to remove the double incentive of being able to buy a property, claim a loss and then sell it and get a tax benefit from the capital gain. But OK, we know that won’t happen in this environment, so what about … gee, I don’t know, do something about supply? The Grattan Institute has been looking at housing for some time and in one of its most recent reports noted that “unlike most developed countries, Australia has had little increase in housing per person in the past two decades”. The obvious solution is to increase supply and one way is through actually making this easier to occur. Australia’s planning rules are highly restrictive and very much favour “nimbyism” that only serves to protect those who own a house over those who would wish to become owners. A federal government could also provide incentives to local governments to open up areas for medium density housing – ie increasing the supply. Stamp duty, in the words of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, is “a tax on mobility – on people moving location”. He added that “if we’re looking for an economy that’s dynamic and vibrant, we want to remove taxes on mobility”. The government’s current plan involves giving tax incentives to those aged 55 if they sell their home. But being able to put “$300,000 into superannuation from the sale of their home” only further distorts the already horrendous distortions in the superannuation system which will again favour those who already own houses – and who would now have an advantage over those first-home buyers competing for the same two or three bedroom homes. It is ineffective as a tax incentive to overcome the tax problem of stamp duty. So why not remove stamp duty instead of further distorting the superannuation and housing system? But these are all about the private sector side of things. Let’s be honest, over 40 years of evidence has shown the private sector will not provide a solution. So: My colleagues at the Australia Institute’s Nordic Policy Centre have noted that a major issue with Australia housing policy is that it regards housing as an asset rather than a need. Prof Andrew Scott notes that “from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s the commonwealth shifted most of its funding to assist payment of rent including for tenants in the private sector – rather than giving more support to the states to supply public housing”. This meant by the mid-1990s “public housing became seen increasingly as ‘residual welfare’ housing”. The move away from public and social housing to incentivising private housing is clear when you consider that in the past year around 10% less public housing was built than in 1970, despite our population now being double what it was then: If the graph does not display click here Prof Street notes that this is a purposeful state of affairs, not a natural one. He notes that “in Sweden, public housing is more than triple the proportion it is in Australia”. One solution he proposes also involves the superannuation sector. But rather than, in effect, trying to individualise the gains that occur from the community pool of superannuation, he recommends instead “the Australian government should now require some of the collective capital in superannuation funds to be invested in affordable housing to ensure fund members can have an adequate retirement”. Another Nordic policy that could be pursued involves co-operatives. As Prof Scott puts it “rental housing co-operatives exist to provide housing, not accrue wealth”. In a co-operative the building or property is owned by a legal entity of which the residents are members and joint owners. Sweden’s housing co-operatives amount to 22% of the total housing stock, while it is 15% in all of Norway, but 40% in the capital, Oslo. As his colleague Dr Sidsel Grimstad notes, it is “similar in many ways to strata title in Australia, where a body corporate of the residents manages the shared spaces jointly. But the main difference is that a housing co-operative is ‘user-owned’ while strata title is ‘investor-owned’.” A key aspect of co-operative housing is that you must live in the dwelling, not use it as an investment. And for rental co-operatives, tenants do not own their dwelling but instead, as Grimstad notes “rent it affordably from a non-profit housing organisation” and they are “actively involved in decision-making and management of maintenance and outdoor areas”. Will these be what everyone wants? Obviously not. But it highlights that there are numerous different paths ahead that don’t involve pumping up demand and pumping up prices.

5/16/2022,"Good morning. Boris Johnson travels to Northern Ireland today to confront a political paradox: the Democratic Unionist party lost support at the recent Stormont elections, and is using the moment to exert its power. On Friday, the DUP blocked the election of a speaker at the Northern Ireland assembly, leaving the power-sharing assembly unable to function in an attempt to secure changes to the post-Brexit protocol which governs trade across the Irish Sea. After a weekend of not-that-diplomatic media appearances by Conservatives which seemed to reinforce the prospect of the UK unilaterally overriding parts of the deal without EU agreement, Johnson is expected to strike a more conciliatory tone in Belfast. He will say he’s seeking reform that has “the broadest possible cross-community support”. But with ministers expected to meet as soon as tomorrow to sign off plans that would allow the UK to unilaterally rewrite parts of the same agreement Johnson hailed as a “very good deal” when he signed it, not everybody believes him. In a potentially crucial week for Northern Ireland’s future, today’s newsletter will try to set the scene by explaining who wants what. First, here are the headlines. Police | Priti Patel has been accused of a “power grab” which would allow her to intervene in local law enforcement matters and silence police chiefs. One chief constable called the plans “profoundly dangerous”. US gun violence | Joe Biden said racially motivated hate crime was “abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation” after an 18-year-old white supremacist killed 10 people in Buffalo, New York. The attacker shot 11 Black and two white victims. Ukraine | Russia may have lost a third of the invasion force it sent into Ukraine, British military intelligence said. The estimate came as Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said Russia’s offensive in Donbas had stalled and Ukraine could win the war. Wagatha Christie | Wayne Rooney will this week give evidence in his wife’s libel trial with Rebekah Vardy. The multimillion-pound case is entering its final days at the high court in London. Protest | A new statue of Margaret Thatcher was egged within two hours of it being installed in her home town of Grantham on Sunday. There had been warnings that protests were ““absolutely inevitable”. Ah, Brexit! Did you miss it? If you have trouble keeping the complexities of the Northern Ireland protocol straight in your head, you’re not alone. (The sharp spike in searches over the last week tells its own story, and they can’t *all* be journalists writing on deadline.) You can remind yourself of what’s at stake with Lisa O’Carroll’s very clear explainer from last week, or Friday’s First Edition from Nimo Omer - but here’s a very quick refresher: by putting checks on goods coming across the Irish Sea from Great Britain, the protocol was supposed to be a pragmatic guarantee of Northern Ireland’s smooth future trading relationship with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. But the DUP and their allies say that, no matter that the British government signed them off, the checks are inhibiting trade with the rest of the UK. Whether by accident or design, one of the most striking parts of the recent resumption in diplomatic hostilities over the protocol has been the difficulty of figuring out what the British government really wants – and that has only intensified alarm on the other side. So here’s a guide to what we know about where the key players stand. Boris Johnson The details released in advance of the prime minister’s visit to Belfast today emphasise his desire for power-sharing to resume – and to seek “the broadest cross-community support” for reforms to the protocol. That might be read as an attempt to cool tensions with the EU by urging the DUP to get back to Stormont. Jessica Elgot and Lisa O’Carroll’s story quotes a Whitehall source saying: “The priority tomorrow is to calm things down.” If so, reports that ministers will work to sign off on the wording of a law that would allow changes to the protocol without the EU’s consent this week might be read as a negotiating tactic. “We want a weapon on the table,” an unnamed senior ally of the prime minister is quoted as saying in the Sunday Times. “We don’t want to use it.” Less obviously peaceful is the wording in Johnson’s very long article for the Belfast Telegraph today: “I hope the EU’s position changes. If it does not, there will be a necessity to act”. Liz Truss Boris Johnson is not the only government player – and much of the briefing in recent days has centred on claims that the foreign secretary has a far more combative approach. Her conversation with her EU counterpart Maroš Šefčovič on Thursday, in which she said that unless the EU showed more flexibility the UK would have “no choice but to act”, was said to have “flabbergasted” Brussels. With claims (categorically denied) that her allies are undermining more cautious cabinet colleagues and trying to throw red meat to the Tory membership in case of any vacancy at No 10, one Downing Street source called her approach “leadership feather-fluttering”. (Sidenote: has anyone used a phrase like “leadership feather-fluttering” who doesn’t work in politics?) She is not alone: Downing Street deputy chief of staff David Canzini has been said to take the same line, while former Brexit negotiator Lord Frost last week said Johnson must take the same approach in Northern Ireland that he has in Ukraine and rip up the protocol. If that seems like a transparently provocative bit of rhetoric, it’s also a very deliberate one. Tory MPs We might be used to the avid Brexiteers of the European Research Group setting the backbench agenda – but more moderate Conservative voices appear to be more of a problem for the government on this. Last week, some of those backbenchers suggested that an intervention from Theresa May was only the beginning of strong opposition to any attempt to override the protocol. On Sunday, the Conservative chair of the Northern Ireland select committee Simon Hoare said it would be “naive nonsense for the government to ask anyone to believe that they didn’t understand what they signed up to”. A quick study of Boris Johnson’s previous praise of the protocol would suggest he has a point. Still, if other MPs are convinced that those moves really are a negotiating tactic, many of them may stay quiet for now. The DUP If voters in Northern Ireland were rejecting the DUP’s intransigence at the recent Stormont election, that message does not appear to have been heard: instead of presenting a more moderate face to win voters from the surging centrist Alliance party and the Ulster Unionist party, the DUP has doubled down. That is partly a matter of principle – and partly, Rory Carroll wrote on Friday, an attempt to reassure those who defected to the party’s more radical new rival, the Traditional Unionist Voice. (The UUP also opposes the protocol but opposes disruption to the running of Stormont.) Ahead of Johnson’s visit, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson – who has previously claimed that his party did “extremely well” in an election where their vote fell by almost a quarter – said that he did not expect to be swayed. “We await to hear what the prime minister has to say, but we will not make judgments based on words,” he said. “It is decisive action that must be taken.” Sinn Féin Unsurprisingly, Sinn Féin’s deputy leader and would-be first minister Michelle O’Neill takes a very different view: she has said she will tell Johnson “that he needs to stop pandering to the DUP” and said that overriding the protocol would be “reckless” and “deepen political instability”. She presents that as a moderate view as well as an ideological one: crucial to her approach has been presenting herself as ready to “take on the leadership of the Northern Ireland executive as a first minister for all” – the first time she has ever used the phrase “Northern Ireland”. That is an extension of what Rory Carroll described last week as a “tightly disciplined campaign that targeted centrist voters and focused on the cost of living and healthcare as opposed to a united Ireland”. Ireland and the EU Perhaps the sharpest signs of the difficulties that could lie ahead came in Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney’s interview with Sky News’ Sophy Ridge yesterday. He said he was “deeply concerned for the wellbeing of the partnership between our countries.” And he added that while he would prefer to be “good neighbours, good friends” – Ramsay Street diplomacy, you might call it – hostile briefings from the UK government had “raised a real red flag in Dublin and in Brussels” and “forced Ireland into taking a much more strident position”. For all that, Coveney did hold out hope for a compromise, acknowledging that unionists have “legitimate concerns” over the protocol. He said that it was reasonable to look for a way to limit checks on goods which are going to stay in Northern Ireland, and that the EU did not want a trade war – but that if a “landing zone” could not be found, there would be consequences. Boris Johnson’s visit to Belfast is unlikely to provide a conclusive answer as to whether the British government is really up for that kind of clash – but that uncertainty can’t last much longer. It’s been almost nine months since Afghanistan fell to the Taliban. In this brilliant, detailed piece Ruchi Kumar and Hikmat Noori examine how the new laws are forcing women out of the workforce and what it means for the future of the country.

Archie I loved this interview by Ammar Kalia, who spoke to music titan John Legend. They go through everything from his come-up, to his mother’s addiction, to the political causes he cares about. Nimo There’s absolutely nothing wrong with punctuating your sentences with ‘like’. Sam Wolfson’s Observer piece is a juicy explanation of why, featuring fascinating linguists (Is there any other kind?) on one side, and Michael Gove on the other. Archie If you missed it on Saturday, Simon Hattenstone’s interview with Jacob Dunne, who killed a stranger with a single punch and then turned his life around, is complicated, surprising, and totally riveting. Archie Football | Chelsea won the Women’s FA Cup with a 3-2 extra time victory over Manchester City. Two goals from Sam Kerr and a screamer from Erin Cuthbert secured the victory in front of a record FA Cup final crowd of more than 49,000. Football | Manchester City were held to a 2-2 draw by West Ham to leave open the possibility of Liverpool taking the Premier League title on the last day of the season. City came back from 2-0 down but missed a late penalty to win the game. Cricket | The death of all-rounder Andrew Symonds in a car crash at the age of 46 was greeted with dismay in Australia. Angus Fontaine wrote that he was “a real-life action hero... enigmatic, untameable and unaffected.” Monday’s Guardian print edition leads with “Police chiefs accuse home secretary of ‘power grab’” while the Times has “You are not the thought police, top officers told”. The Mirror’s lead is “Victims of hate” – it says the suspect in the Buffalo shooting in the US had a “UK obsession”. “Radiant, happy and simply … glorious” – the Daily Mail celebrates the Queen’s appearance at the first of her platinum jubilee celebrations. The Sun calls her “Happy Maj” and rates it a “Top One”, referencing the involvement of Tom Cruise. The Queen is also on the front page of the Express while its top story is “Boris warns EU: we’ll act if you don’t change”. “PM’s gamble risks trade war with EU” – that’s the i while the Telegraph has “PM attacks Brussels over cost of living crisis”. The Metro splashes on “Ukraine’s defiant promise, Kyiv will host Eurovision”. The front-page lead in the Financial Times is “Sweden and Finland to herald ‘new era’ with Nato applications”. Marcos’ myths: the dictator’s son rewriting history in the Philippines Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos is on course for a landslide victory in the Philippines presidential election. For those who grew up under the martial law of his father, the result brings up the horrors of the past. A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad After many years of dismal failure, the UK finally had a decent night at Eurovision - only giving up first place to a winner everybody could get behind, Ukraine. Of the UK entry from Sam Ryder (picturing arriving at Heathrow above), TV critic and Eurovision pundit Scott Bryan said: “The song was fantastic but just as importantly the performance was fantastic … it was a real thrill to watch.” Meanwhile, Kalush Orchestra’s victory for Ukraine with their anthemic folk/hip-hop song Stefania led to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy promising that the contest would “one day” be held in Mariupol.

5/16/2022,"One morning last summer, Nasira* arrived for work at the government building in Kabul where she was employed in a managerial position to find men from the Taliban had occupied her office. “I wasn’t allowed to enter,” the 32-year-old says. “When I enquired why, I was told to wait for a government announcement, which never came.” This was shortly after the Taliban swept to power and seized Kabul, the capital city, on 15 August 2021. That was the last day that Nasira and thousands of women like her were able to go to work. Though the Taliban’s acting prime minister, Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, claimed that women would be allowed to continue working under sharia law, female government employees in Kabul were told to stay at home, and only women whose jobs cannot be done by men were allowed to work. Nasira is technically still employed and receives a significantly reduced salary. “They tell me, ‘we are paying you, what else do you need?’ But money is not my priority,” she says. “I was responsible for our department’s services to women citizens. I want to serve my people, especially the women of my country, who are not receiving services they need because there are no women officials to help them.” It is not only government positions that women have been forced out of. According to Reporters Without Borders, only 100 of Kabul’s 700 female journalists were still working by the end of 2021. In 2019, 36% of teachers in the country were women, according World Bank data, the highest number for 20 years, but the Taliban’s ban in March on education for girls forced many female educators out of work. Sima Bahous, the UN Women executive director, said this month: “Current restrictions on women’s employment have been estimated to result in an immediate economic loss of up to $1bn – or up to 5% of Afghanistan’s GDP.” She added: “There is almost universal poverty in the country.” The Afghan academic and former minister of mines, Nargis Nehan, says: “It is hard to collect data under the Taliban, and access to information is limited, but under the previous government 27% of the civil servants and almost 40% of the teachers were women. But only a handful of women are allowed to work these days.” The latest in the series of decrees issued by the recently reinstated ministry for the propagation of virtue requires “all respectable Afghan women to wear a hijab” – and identifying the chador (the blue Afghan burqa) as the “best hijab” of choice – will have a significant impact on the remaining women in public roles. The order also went on to criminalise women’s clothes and said female government employees who violated the dress code would be fired. “As per the Afghan Women’s Chamber of Commerce, we had over 3,500 small and medium business owners who were women, the majority of whom are now closed because they couldn’t survive,” Nehan says. “Because how do you expect women to work or run a business under a chador or facing fear of punishment for showing their face?” A gynaecologist from Herat, who wishes to be identified only as Dr Maryam, says: “Even before this decree, they made hijab mandatory for women doctors, and require female surgeons to wear long sleeves, and a long scarf, even during surgery. It affects the way they work and is not safe.” Armed Taliban officials often force themselves into the hospital, she adds, especially during night shifts, to “monitor the work” of the female doctors and nurses. “They had also briefly insisted on women doctors having their mahram [male guardian] with them at all times, which is not practical especially on a women’s ward.” There are no figures for the number of women who have left healthcare roles, but according to an article from the BMJ, women make up nearly half of Afghanistan’s community health worker programme. “One hospital in Kabul reported that segregation of men and women, for staff as well as patients, had been requested already,” the BMJ said. “Women are especially restricted in their freedom of movement and often require male guardians to merely leave their homes. Even midwives have to be accompanied when doing home visits. Due to lack of information, some are stuck at home entirely, waiting for new directions.” “Although these restrictions are not new – I recall working under the Taliban regime the last time they were in power and had imposed similar restrictions – they are new to this generation, and will discourage younger women from joining professions under the Taliban’s hateful gaze,” Maryam says. “Do we really want to go back to those days? How will it benefit Afghanistan?” The Taliban takeover prompted many Afghan female doctors, especially those who worked in reproductive and sexual health, to flee the country. Those who remained are now facing threats from local Taliban leaders for not complying with their rules, Maryam says. Afghan women have made significant inroads into various sectors over the past 20 years, after the fall of the Taliban in 2001. According to World Bank data, women comprised nearly 22% of the Afghan workforce and numbers were steadily growing. But a report from the International Labour Organization (ILO) in January found that Afghan women’s employment levels fell by an estimated 16% in the third quarter of 2021, compared with 6% for men. Women’s employment was expected to be 21% lower than before the Taliban takeover by mid-2022 if current conditions continued, according to the ILO, though this does not take into account employees such as Nasira who are still paid without being allowed to work. Restricting women from participating in economic and public activities will have a dire impact on the economy, a UN report warned last December. It could, for example, shave half a billion dollars from household consumption alone. Nasira’s supervisor, who wished be identified only as Abdul, confirms that services have been affected since female colleagues were sent home. “I had seven women in my team and, since the Taliban takeover, none of them has been allowed back to work. They were the backbone of the department, and to be honest, they were more hardworking than the men,” he says. “Not only has our workload increased, we are unable to provide adequate technical services to Afghan women, who were way more comfortable approaching our female staff with their problems. We are worse off without our female colleagues.” * Some names have been changed.

5/16/2022,"Sea sponges off New Zealand’s southern coastline have been found bleached bone-white for the first time, following extreme ocean temperatures. A group of scientists from Victoria University of Wellington were alarmed to discover the sponges, which are typically a rich chocolate brown, were bleached in more than a dozen sites near Breaksea Sound and Doubtful Sound in Fiordland. The university’s marine biology professor James Bell said in some parts as many as 95% of the sponges were bleached. “Our initial estimates are there are at least hundreds of thousands of sponges likely to have been bleached and maybe even many more than that,” he said. Bell’s team discovered the mass bleaching during a research trip in April. The species, which is common to the lower South Island, is one of 800 species of sponge found in New Zealand. Sponge gardens dominate the sea floor around the country and hold an important role in creating habitats for fish and releasing carbon that other species feed off. There have been reports of sponges bleaching, including off the coast of Tasmania earlier this year, but typically they tend to be more tolerant to oceanic changes compared with other species such as corals, Bell said. “It’s a really unusual event,” he said. “This just highlights the kind of climate crisis that we’re facing. There are so many species around New Zealand and we don’t know what their thermal tolerances are.” Last year, the world’s oceans were the hottest in recorded history, due to climate change, which among other things can cause the oceans to acidify and degrade reefs and ecosystems. New Zealand was no exception, with 2021 its hottest year on record. Temperatures in April were still unseasonably high, with coastal water temperatures up to 2.6 degrees above average, according to the National Institute for Water and Atmospherics. In Fiordland, those temperatures were even higher, said Rob Smith, a University of Otago oceanographer, who works with the government-funded Moana Project researching marine heatwaves. He told RNZ the region recorded temperatures up to 5 degrees higher than usual. “What we’ve seen this summer is the strongest marine heatwave on the west coast of the South Island in 40 years.” Further research was needed to establish definitively whether ocean temperatures are causing the bleaching, Bell said. At this stage the researchers had an observation and a “very strong correlation” between the bleaching and a severe temperature spike. Some bleached sponges could come back to life, Bell said, but the team would need to return to the site to see how they were faring towards the end of the month. “There is some hope they may not die, but unfortunately some of them are a little bit manky and not very happy or healthy.”",News/World news,Bleached sea sponges found in New Zealand waters for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/bleached-sea-sponges-found-in-new-zealand-waters-for-first-time
