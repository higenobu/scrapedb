12/17/2021,"After months of viral videos showing deteriorating conditions on the streets of San Francisco, including smash-and-grab robberies and open-air drug use, the city’s mayor has moved to implement a new public safety approach to curb criminal behavior. Her move could signal a recognition by the Democratic establishment that crime may prove a potent issue in upcoming elections. Speaking at City Hall on Tuesday, San Francisco Mayor London Breed lamented “all the bullshit that has destroyed our city,” including thefts at high-end stores like Louis Vuitton, rampant vehicle break-ins and a seeming flood of the potent drug fentanyl. All of it has been captured on video, making for regular Fox News segments and rising consternation among Democrats who see crime as a potential weakness in next year’s midterm elections. “We are not a city where anything goes,” a shaken Breed said. “Our compassion should not be mistaken for weakness or indifference,” she added, in reference to the California city’s famous culture of tolerance. A native of San Francisco who was raised in a public housing project and maneuvered the city’s treacherous politics to become its first African American female mayor, the 47-year-old Breed could show other Democrats across the nation how to handle public safety in a way that neither recalls the law-and-order practices of the early 1990s, which especially harshly penalized Black men, nor concedes on all fronts to criminal justice activists who conservatives have accused of not being tough enough on crime for the sake of meeting ideological aims. In her remarks, Breed conceded that her emphasis on public safety could “make a lot of people uncomfortable.” “And I don’t care,” she added. “At the end of the day, the safety of the people of San Francisco is the most important thing to me.” The plan she introduced Tuesday was relatively modest, addressing the Tenderloin, an especially troubled neighborhood in the center of the city that serves as a nexus of social problems, most visibly homelessness, drug addiction and untreated mental illness. For the most part, Breed is calling for more policing in the neighborhood, a predictable move but a noteworthy one all the same, given how eagerly progressives in cities like San Francisco embraced the movement to “defund” police departments in the summer of 2020. Breed is also working with Supervisor Ahsha Safai to stop the resale of stolen goods, operations that law enforcement authorities say are often organized via social media. Earlier this year, Safai made news when he shared images on social media of his shattered car window. The crime took place in front of City Hall. “Public safety isn’t just about the Tenderloin,” Breed said. “We know there are issues all over this city.” Breed’s frank acknowledgment of crime comes as Democratic leaders struggle to reconcile public safety concerns with political imperatives. In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently seemed to suggest that retailers themselves were not doing enough to stop crime. Concerns about safety led New Yorkers to vote in Eric Adams, a former New York Police Department officer who made public safety a centerpiece of his mayoral campaign. Meanwhile, the White House appears at pains to strike the right tone on criminal justice issues. President Biden is the author of the 1994 crime bill, which has been blamed for mass incarceration and overly aggressive policing. Since then, the party he now leads has moved significantly to the left on criminal justice matters, especially in the wake of the 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The gender equity plan the Biden administration released earlier this year vowed to “end cash bail and reform our pretrial system.” Such reforms are precisely the problem, Breed argued on Tuesday. “When the police make an arrest, the residents of the Tenderloin should not see that same person back on the streets the next day, dealing drugs right in front of their neighborhood,” she said. Breed said that she would unveil the details of her new policing plan next month, and that it would remain in effect for two months. While the scope is limited, the symbolism could be enormous, given the outsize role San Francisco — and California in general — plays in the cultural imagination. Not in attendance for her remarks was Chesa Boudin, the city’s embattled district attorney. A former public defender, Boudin has made decarceration the center of his approach to prosecution. His detractors have mounted a recall effort, arguing that lax policies have made the city less safe and charging that his day-to-day administration of the prosecutor’s office has been incompetent. Boudin has argued that crime is down overall. His supporters have launched harsh attacks on journalists reporting on San Francisco’s seemingly intractable disorder. But that has hardly quelled dissatisfaction with his policies, with 80,000 people signing a petition to recall him. Only 50,000 signatures were required to set up a recall election next summer. The mayor has also challenged leaders of the city’s school board, who last year tried to change schools named for Abraham Lincoln and George Washington, citing racism concerns. In the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, schools in California refrained from returning to in-person education for much longer than other parts of the nation, deepening many parents’ fury. Breed is now maneuvering to strip the board of its power, mirroring a similar move in New York years ago. “The school board has often focused on the wrong thing at the expense of the big picture,” she said earlier this week, sounding little like the San Francisco liberal she has been for her entire political career.",U.S./Yahoo News,San Francisco Mayor London Breed announces plan to go after 'bulls*** that has destroyed our city',https://news.yahoo.com/san-francisco-mayor-london-breed-announces-plan-to-go-after-bulls-that-has-destroyed-our-city-223520956.html

12/17/2021,"A Chinese man has been slapped with a 10 year prison sentence for selling five of his children. The man was accused by a Chinese court of having children for the sole purpose of selling them. Between 2012 and 2020, Yang sold two sons and three daughters for 180,000 Chinese yuan ($28,275). A Chinese man has been sentenced to ten years in prison for selling his five children for profit. According to a document released by the court of Yu County, a town in the northwestern Chinese province of Hebei, the man, whose surname is Yang, sold five of his children for a total of 180,000 Chinese yuan (around $28,275). The court said its investigations concluded that the man and his wife, surnamed Yuan, had the children with the express aim of selling them off to whoever wanted to buy them. The court noted that the man had sold all five children — two sons and three daughters — between 2012 and 2020, for sums ranging from 20,000 Chinese yuan ($3,141) to 80,000 Chinese yuan ($12,566). Of the five children, four — three daughters and a son — were sold to a middleman who was identified by the courts as Li, and his daughter-in-law. Li received 3,600 Chinese yuan ($565) for facilitating the transactions. The couple also sold a son to a woman who was in the maternity ward with Yuan when she gave birth to the boy. For their roles in the crime, the middleman, Li, was sentenced to a prison term of seven years. His daughter-in-law, Duan, received a jail term of 21 months for posing as the mother of two of the children to meet potential buyers. The children's biological mother was not cited in the court documents. ""Children who should have been cared for and allowed to grow up in a loving environment were exploited and treated like goods by their parents and perceived as money-making tools by greedy traffickers. Yang has betrayed his children, and his immoral conduct has been punished to the full extent of the law,"" read the document from the Yu County court. ""The sale of children by their guardians not only infringes the rights of minors but also supports the existence and expansion of the illegal trade,"" the court added. The South China Morning Post reported that while child trafficking was a rampant crime in the country in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly after China adopted its one-child policy, cases of child abduction and human trafficking still occur. The SCMP cited statistics from a Chinese Ministry of Public Security press conference in September, where it was announced that the number of child abduction cases dropped from around 6,000 cases in 2012 to 666 cases in 2021. There have, however, been other shocking instances of Chinese parents exchanging their kids for cash. In May, a man named Xie in the southern Zhejiang province was accused of selling his two-year-old son to a childless couple for $24,400, then using the money to go on vacation, the SCMP reported.

12/17/2021,"Paul Gosar's chief of staff went to great lengths to find evidence of voter fraud, court documents say. In one notable incident, he tried to intercept a plane rumored to be stuffed with fake votes. He failed. No evidence has emerged for this kind of elaborate voter fraud. The chief of staff for Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona tried to catch a plane rumored to be full of fake votes, court document say. The episode is one of the most outlandish in the fruitless search by allies of former President Donald Trump for proof that the 2020 election was stolen. Gosar's aide, Tom Van Flein, hunted for a plane from South Korea that conspiracy theorists identified as a source of what they thought was election-changing levels of fraud, per documents cited by The New York Times on Thursday. They found a Korean Air plane, but no proof of stolen ballots. Gosar himself, a Republican and close ally of Trump, has long pushed conspiracy theories of a stolen election. The incident with Van Flein was described in a Supreme Court lawsuit filed in March by voter Staci Burk challenging Arizona's election result, which found Joe Biden had won the state. The lawsuit's documents said he was in a group who travelled on November 7, 2020 to an airplane parking lot near Phoenix after rumors circulated that a plane filled with fake ballots had landed. According to the documents, the expedition was prompted by a tip sent to independent journalist Ryan Hartwig that a plane from South Korea loaded with fake votes had landed in Sky Harbor Airport on election night, and was about to depart. Van Flein is also mentioned as a participant in an account of the trip on Hartwig's website. Hartwig and Van Flein were accompanied by GOP congressional candidate Josh Barrett, activist Marko Triskovitts and other on the expedition, according to the documents. They recorded grainy footage of the exterior of plane belonging to Korean Air, the national carrier of South Korea. It was then uploaded onto Hartwig's website. The lawsuit said that one of the group called the local sheriff urging him to investigate. No proof of fake ballots ever emerged. Insider contacted Gosar's office, and all of those named in the documents, for comment. Gosar closely embraced Trump's election fraud conspiracy theories, and spent months hyping an audit of votes in Maricopa County. The audit wound up in October having found that Biden had indeed won the election there, by slightly more votes than in the official count. The belief that votes were being shipped in from abroad was one of the many conspiracy theories pushed by Trump allies as they sought to undermine Biden's win. The audit in Maricopa was conducted by a firm run by a Trump supporter, Cyber Ninjas. At one point auditors were looking for traces of bamboo on ballots, hoping to prove a baseless theory that they had their origins in Asia. Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, reportedly pressed FBI officials to investigate the conspiracy theory that China had managed to hack voting machines using thermostats. The election fraud ""Big Lie"" remains at the center of Trump's speeches and public statements as he stirs rumors of another bid for the presidency in 2024, and is eagerly promoted by his close allies in the GOP.
