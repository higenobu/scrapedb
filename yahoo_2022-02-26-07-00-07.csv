2/26/2022,"Up to 70% of the US population can take off their masks according to new CDC guidance. The agency relaxed mask recommendations for counties with low and medium levels of COVID-19. The new guidance reflects the CDC's narrower focus on minimizing severe disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxed mask guidelines for up to 70% of the US population, or 63% of US counties, on Friday. Counties with low and medium levels of COVID-19 no longer need to wear masks in public, the agency said — though people with an increased risk of severe COVID-19, such as immunocompromised people, should talk to their healthcare providers about removing masks if they live in a medium-level county. Counties with high levels of COVID-19 — 37% of US counties right now — still require masks in indoor public settings, including schools, according to the CDC. The agency still recommends that everyone get vaccinated and boosted, if they haven't already, and test themselves if they feel sick. People with COVID-19 symptoms, a positive COVID-19 test, or exposure to someone with COVID-19 should continue to mask up, regardless of transmission in their area, the CDC said. The map below shows where your county sits on the CDC's new scale. Counties with low levels of COVID-19 are marked in green, and encompass 30% of US residents. Counties with medium levels are in yellow, and include 42% of US residents. Counties with high levels are in orange, and include 28% of US residents. The new recommendations reflect the CDC's narrower focus on minimizing severe disease, limiting strain on hospitals, and protecting the most vulnerable individuals. ""The overall risk of severe disease is now generally lower,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a Friday press briefing. ""Now, as the virus continues to circulate in our communities, we must focus our metrics beyond just cases in the community."" Green counties must have fewer than 200 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents, fewer than 10 new COVID-19 hospital admissions per 100,000 residents, and fewer than 10% of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, on average, within the last week. Here's how those metrics compare to yellow and orange counties. Masking is still an option for people in areas with low or medium levels of COVID-19, the CDC added, particularly if they live with someone who is at high risk of severe disease. The guidance is also subject to change, Walensky said on Friday. ""None of us know what the future may hold for us and for this virus,"" she said. ""We need to be prepared and we need to be ready for whatever comes next. We want to give people a break from things like mask-wearing when our levels are low and then have the ability to reach for them again, should things get worse in the future.""

2/26/2022,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia respects Ukraine's territorial integrity and considers Russia's military action against it to be ""wrong,"" but will not impose sanctions against Moscow, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Friday. Serbia, led by Vucic, is performing a delicate balancing act between its European aspirations, partnership with NATO and its centuries-old religious, ethnic and political alliance with Russia. But as tensions between Russia and the European Union over Ukraine are rising, Serbia is under pressure to harmonise its foreign policy with that of the EU, which it aims to join, and introduce sanctions against Moscow, among other things. ""They (Russia) were the only country not to have imposed sanctions against us in the 1990s,"" Vucic said after a National Security Council meeting. ""They also supported our territorial integrity in the United Nations. We must not forget that,"" Vucic said, referring to Russia's stance on Serbia's former province of Kosovo whose independence Moscow refuses to recognise. However, Vucic said the National Security Council concluded the Republic of Serbia considers ""very wrong the violation of territorial integrity of a number of countries including Ukraine."" Serbia has put its gas and oil sectors in Russia's hands. In 2008 the Balkan country sold a majority stake of its oil company to Gazprom Neft. Gazprom is the majority stakeholder in the country's sole gas storage facility. In return, Russia has been blocking membership of Serbia's former province Kosovo in the United Nations. Serbia lost control of Kosovo after a NATO bombing campaign in 1999 to halt killing of ethnic Albanians by Serb forces during a two-year counterinsurgency. Vucic said the National Security Council decided that Serbia will stop all military drills with foreign troops to preserve military neutrality. He said Serbia will take legal action against its citizens who fight abroad.

2/26/2022,"Elizaveta Peskova posted the words ""no to war"" to an Instagram Live, according to Russian reports. Peskova's father is Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, who justifies Russia's actions to the media. The slogan is the same chanted by Russian protesters who marched in its cities this week. The daughter of President Vladimir Putin's spokesman posted an anti-war slogan in her Instagram Live on Friday, according to multiple reports. Elizaveta Peskova, 24, posted ""HET BOЙHE"" — ""no to war,"" against a black background on her Instagram story according to a screenshot tweeted by the Russian outlet TV Rain. This slogan is the main chant used by Russian protesters to oppose the invasions of Ukraine. Peskova is the daughter of Dmitry Peskov, the most prominent spokesperson working for the Kremlin. Peskov routinely gives statements justifying Russia's actions and attacking the US and its allies. Francis Scarr, a senior digital reporter at the BBC, also noted Peskova's posting in a tweet. Soon after Scarr posted the screenshot, Washington Post reporter Mary Ilyushina said that it had been taken down. Insider was unable to find it, which is consistent with a deletion. —Mary Ilyushina (@maryilyushina) February 25, 2022 The incident is likely to be deeply embarrassing to Peskov and Putin's wider circle. Aside from the president himself, Peskov is among the most high-ranking and visible people in the Russian president's orbit, and robustly defended Thursday's decision to invade Ukraine. Peskov spoke bullishly on Friday about ""retaliatory measures"" from Russia in reaction to the recently-imposed sanctions from the West, according to state-run TASS News agency. This is not the first time Peskova has prompted political intrigue. In 2o19 it emerged that she had become an intern for a right-wing MEP, Aymeric Chauprade, prompting concerns that sensitive political information could filter back to the Kremlin, the BBC reported. Peskova did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
