1/22/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Selling has gotten intense enough in stocks that volatility indexes are pricing more turbulence in the here and now than in the future. The setup, known as an inverted VIX, is sometimes viewed as a positive for those hoping markets will calm.

The Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of option costs, has surged 7 points to 26 over the span, pushing its spot price above that of its three-month futures for the first time in more than a month. Such an inverted curve has occurred four other times in the past year and all coincided with market bottoms. Stocks continued to waver Friday amid concern over Federal Reserve tightening and disappointing results from pandemic darlings like Netflix Inc. At its worst point, the Nasdaq 100 dropped as much as 2%, extending further into its correction territory. A flurry of selling orders were fired, sparking extreme readings in some technical indicators such as the TICK index and New York Stock Exchange Short-Term Trading Index, or TRIN. “Into the open today, we were looking for indications of panic readings for a more tradeable bottom ahead,” said Alon Rosin, Oppenheimer & Co.’s head of institutional equity derivatives. “Between the TICK/TRIN readings during the morning flush and VIX inversions, it is possible that fear, panic has finally arrived.” Stocks were little changed in late Friday morning trade, with the S&P 500 on track for a 3.7% decline over the shortened trading week.

1/22/2022,"The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization began to drop Thursday around 19:00 UTC (2 p.m. ET), following the lead of the equity market, which saw a sharp decline into the U.S. 4 p.m. close. Here’s what analysts are saying is behind the fall in price: 1. Negative market sentiment Bitcoin’s (BTC) fall in price is a simple continuation of the same trend that has been occurring in the last few weeks – negative market sentiment. “This sentiment is fueled by a slew of gloomy news that overwhelms any form of objective asset data,” said Jason Deane, analyst at Quantum Economics. Although Deane’s long-term outlook is positive, he thinks that the current price action will probably continue in the immediate/short-term, and that further downward pressure is possible. “Once fear sets in, it takes a while to break and you simply have to wait for capitulation before you can move back to ""normalized"" ranges.” 2. Leveraged long positions Another reason, according to Ben McMillan, founder of IDX Digital Assets, is leveraged long positions, which exacerbated the sell-off into the Asian open on Friday. “This is nearly always the case with bitcoin,” said McMillan, who said that “$40,000 was an important support which has now turned into a resistance level and we could certainly see more downside over the weekend.” 3. BTC is moving in conjunction with traditional markets Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market as a whole is acting as a high-sentiment beta asset – meaning it is moving in tandem with the broader markets and is more impacted by the recent negative sentiment, according to Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock. “Macroeconomic fears and poor technology company earnings have also exacerbated this correlation,” said Outumuro. At press time, bitcoin was trading at $38,446, according to CoinDesk data.

1/22/2022,"Your interview is progressing well. You’ve concisely communicated why you're here — in your career journey and in this interview — with your “tell us about yourself” narrative. You’ve provided concrete examples of your professional accomplishments that speak to your readiness for this role. You’ve conveyed the value you could bring. You think they're convinced. Then comes that final question: “Do you have any questions for us?” It’s tempting to skip this one. It’s the end of the interview, and by this point, you may be feeling slightly wrung out, overwhelmed, and even short on time. Be aware, hiring managers often place a lot of weight on what you say here. Why? Because asking questions can signal your interest in the company and the position. Your questions can demonstrate that you’ve done some upfront research; that you’ve been listening intently throughout the interview; that you are curious and want to learn more. The one thing you don’t want to say here is that you don’t have any questions for your interviewers. As a leadership professor and head of the Office of Career Services at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, I’ve had the opportunity to work with successful, mid-career professionals as they navigate the interview process. We talk a lot about the process — and the importance of this one question. Here’s my advice on answering it well. Plan ahead. Assemble a list of questions that you truly want answered; sincere curiosity goes a long way. You likely won’t ask all your questions, but it’s good to have several ready so you don’t ask a question that the interviewer has already answered. In most settings, asking two to three questions is ideal — asking more may suggest that you don’t respect the interviewers’ time. Be sure to read the room and body language for signs that they want to wrap up the meeting. Remember: You’ll have opportunities to learn more in future conversations, so don’t overdo it. Do your research. Don’t ask questions that can be easily answered with a quick online search. Scan the company website about basic details and history, as well as current news articles about the organization’s recent challenges and successes. Reach out to current and former employees to find out more about what it’s like to work there. Your social network could be a good source for locating these folks, and your university alumni office may help with introductions. Questions that demonstrate you’ve done your “homework” are strong signals that you take this opportunity seriously. Tailor your questions to suit the meeting. When you’re speaking with someone from human resources, ask questions about the interviewing process or the overall organization. When you’re speaking with the hiring manager or your world-be supervisor, ask more specific questions about the role itself or the team. If speaking with prospective colleagues in adjacent departments, ask about collaboration and work culture. Refer back to projects or ideas the hiring team has mentioned. Reference what you were told earlier in the conversation when you ask a question. This conveys active listening, respect and a desire to learn more. Not all questions are good questions. Avoid “yes/no” questions. You want the two-way conversation to continue, so ask open-ended questions. Also, avoid self-serving questions — those about salary, vacation days and other benefits; save those for after you get the job offer. Finally, try not to ask multi-pronged or overly complicated questions. This is not “stump the interviewer” time. It is a chance to show your interest in learning more about the work, the team and the organization. As you compile your list of questions for the hiring manager or team, here are a few suggestions to get you started. Again, make them your own. In your opinion, what does success in this role look like? Are there key performance indicators? If hired for this position, what should I aim to accomplish in my first three months? What are the strengths that have led others to succeed in this role? How did this position come to be open? How long have you been with the company, and what's something you enjoy about working here? Can you tell me a little about the company culture? What do you see as the most pressing challenge this company is facing right now? This team? Is there anything else I can provide to help you with your decision? Neta Moye is an assistant dean and executive director of the Offices of Career Services at the University of Maryland’s Robert H.
