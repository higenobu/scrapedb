4/20/2022,"Two warning lights appeared on our Skoda Fabia, eight days before the warranty expired. The Skoda handbook recommends driving immediately to the nearest dealer if these lights illuminate, as the car can suddenly lose power. However, neither of our two local Skoda dealers could offer a booking until after the warranty expired, both saying we would have to pay for the repair. Neither would formally log the fault as having arisen during the warranty period. They are adamant this is Skoda policy, which implies any warranty claim can be rejected by not dealing with it until after the expiry date.FK, Dunbar Skoda’s stance is, in my opinion, a breathtaking rebuttal of consumer rights, and I wonder if other brands are similarly trying it on. The email you received when you complained to Skoda UK customer service echoed the dealers’ stance and recommended you find another dealer (the next nearest is 55 miles away) which could fit you in. It helpfully attached the warranty terms and conditions. Nowhere does it state faults must be inspected before the warranty expires, only that they are reported as soon as they occur. Skoda UK changed its tune when I got in touch. Or, rather, it glossed over the fact that its own customer service had upheld this phantom policy and laid all the blame on the dealerships. It says: “I can confirm that if a potential warranty issue is officially raised with a Skoda retailer before the end of the warranty, regardless of whether the car has been inspected, Skoda UK will honour the claim providing that the inspection confirms the issue, initially raised by the customer, to be covered under warranty.” When pressed as to why head office hadn’t confirmed this when you complained, it said it was “working to ensure” its dealer network was fully informed of warranty terms and conditions. It seems that only because you turned to the press that customer service conjured up an appointment for your car to be assessed. Consumer law expert Gary Rycroft, partner at Joseph A Jones & Co, says he is “staggered by their audacity!” He confirmed that even if the “policy” was in the terms and conditions, it would be an unfair clause and therefore not legally enforceable. “The logical conclusion is that if they never had any inspection appointments available ever, they would never have to abide by the warranty,” he says.

4/20/2022,"The story behind the audacious 1944 escape from the Luftwaffe’s Stalag Luft III prison camp is to be retold in a new play at London’s Alexandra Palace, which was itself used as an internment camp for German, Austrian and Hungarian “enemy aliens” during the first world war. Tom, Dick and Harry will recount the breakout of 76 allied airmen from the camp at Sagan in Germany (now Żagań in Poland) which inspired the 1963 film The Great Escape, featuring an all-star cast and a thrilling though fictitious motorbike exploit for Steve McQueen. The play is written by Theresa Heskins, Andrew Pollard and Michael Hugo with Heskins also directing. The writing team’s research was carried out at the National Archives. “The first file we opened had been classified until 1972,” said Heskins. “It said ‘top secret’ on the front in a red stamp. The next document said ‘closed until 1995’ and said ‘most secret’. The third one said ‘to be destroyed’.” As well as information from the Swiss Red Cross, the War Office and air ministry papers, the team read technical documents that had been drawn up by some of those involved in the escape from the camp. Heskins, who has never seen The Great Escape, was struck during her research by the ingenuity of the prisoners and said the play was an inspiring story about “human endeavour and the magic of collaboration”. Heskins called the drama “great escapism” and added: “The story is comic, tragic, an adventure, and quite thoughtful at times.” It had been a privilege, she said, to explore the archives: “And distressing, too, because these are real lives in front of you.” The play’s title comes from the code names for the escape and decoy tunnels that were secretly dug over several months by prisoners who transported bags of earth within a wooden vaulting horse, which they also hid inside. Potential digging tools were picked up wherever possible: an inventory within the camp after the escape revealed that 1,219 knives, 478 spoons and 582 forks had gone missing. The prisoners also forged documents and identity cards and prepared their own maps. Three of the escapers found freedom, 73 were captured and 50 of them were shot on the personal orders of Adolf Hitler, against objections from senior German army officers according to MI5 documents released in 2000. Heskins was intrigued to learn that Stalag Luft III had its own theatre that the prisoners had been allowed to build. “They were provided with costumes and instruments by the Berliner Ensemble and other professional theatres and they put on plays that the captors came to see as well. They all sat and watched plays together. We’ve got some amazing photos of a revue they put on called Girls, Girls, Girls.” One document Heskins found, written in 1950 and known as Report X, reflected on future retellings of the escape. Its author, RGK Walker, stated: “I feel it would be better to stress the spirit and organisation behind the escape rather than glorying the lucky few who were chosen out of a hat to take the final risk.” The huge Victorian theatre at Alexandra Palace reopened for regular performance in 2018 after 80 years and an £18.8m lottery-grant restoration. During the first world war about 3,000 men – Austrians, Hungarians and Germans – were interned at what was known as “the people’s palace” when it was requisitioned by the government. Its theatre was used for performances, as well as serving as a chapel and a hospital. Belgian refugees were also housed at Alexandra Palace. Tom, Dick and Harry will be staged in-the-round, said Heskins, “which makes for a spirit of togetherness that is very much in keeping with this story.” In-the-round theatre invites audiences to “bring their imagination” with them, she added – fitting for a story that unfolds not just in a prison camp but also 30ft underground, in an aircraft and across occupied Europe as the men’s great escape continues beyond the camp’s fence. The play opens in June at the New Vic theatre in Newcastle-under-Lyme, where Heskins is artistic director. It then tours to MAST in Southampton in July and Alexandra Palace theatre later that month.",Arts/Stage,Play about ‘great escape’ from German prison camp to be staged at Alexandra Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/20/play-about-great-escape-from-german-prison-camp-to-be-staged-at-alexandra-palace
4/20/2022,"Students are advised to be “more relaxed” about the reputation of the universities they want to attend, after new research revealed they could be better off graduating with a good degree from a less prestigious university than with a lower-class degree from a selective institution. The report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that graduates in England with first-class or upper second class (2.1) honours degrees had higher average earnings by the age of 30 than those who finished with lower second-class (2.2) awards, regardless of institution – meaning that degree class was often more important than institutional reputation. Figures in the report also suggested it was less difficult to obtain a higher-class degree outside selective universities with competitive entry requirements, despite those universities tending to award a larger proportion of 2.1s and firsts. Ben Waltmann, senior research economist at IFS and a co-author of the report, said prospective students, parents and policymakers should take note of the findings, and be “more relaxed” about which institutions they aim to study at. “The findings imply that degree classification may matter as much as university attended for later-life earnings,” Waltmann said. “Going to a more selective university is good for future earnings, and the fact that few students from disadvantaged backgrounds attend the most selective universities is a barrier to social mobility. “But that being said, many graduates who get a 2.2 from a highly selective university might have got a higher-paying job had they attended a slightly less selective university and got a 2.1.” The research, based on detailed government data, found that five years after graduation, annual pretax earnings for both women and men who obtained a lower second-class degree in 2013 were about £3,800 lower than for those who received an upper second-class degree. The study also found that the rewards for higher degree classes vary “hugely” depending on subject. Jack Britton, associate director of the IFS and co-author of the report, said: “For many subjects, the difference between a first and a 2.1 is inconsequential for earnings. However, for others – such as economics, law, business, computing and pharmacology – it is substantial.” For men and women studying law or economics, getting a 2.2 rather than a 2.1 was associated with 15% lower earnings or worse, while there was “no significant difference” in pay between degree classes for those who majored in education or English. But achieving at least a 2.1 led to much higher average pay for graduates of more selective universities. Men and women who gained a 2.2 from the most selective universities – Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College London and the London School of Economics – earned 20% less on average by the age of 30 than those who achieved a 2.1. At the least selective universities, a 2.2 degree led to about 6% lower pay for women and 8% for men. The IFS also noted “stark gender differences” in the rewards between men and women achieving first-class degrees at very selective universities. The increase for a first-class degree versus a 2.1 was almost nothing for women but about 14% for men. “This suggests that fewer high-achieving women go on to high-earning careers,” the IFS said. Waltmann said the graduate gender pay gap was largely explained by subject choice. But even for those who graduated in the same subjects, it was clear that a pay gap had emerged by the age of 30 that was only partly explained by women leaving the labour market to have children. “Children are a key explanation but they are not the only thing going on here,” Waltmann said.",News/Education,"Degree grade matters more than university reputation, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/20/degree-grade-matters-more-than-university-reputation-report-finds
4/20/2022,"Scientists have discovered bacteria linked to aggressive prostate cancer in work hailed as a potential revolution for the prevention and treatment of the most deadly form of the disease. Researchers led by the University of East Anglia performed sophisticated genetic analyses on the urine and prostate tissue of more than 600 men with and without prostate cancer and found five species of bacteria linked to rapid progression of the disease. The study does not prove that the bacteria drive or exacerbate prostate cancer, but if work now under way confirms their role, researchers can develop tests to identify men most at risk and potentially find antibiotics to prevent the cancer from claiming thousands of lives each year. “This is an exciting discovery that has the potential to truly revolutionise treatment for men,” said Dr Hayley Luxton of Prostate Cancer UK, which co-funded the research. Writing in the journal European Urology Oncology, the scientists describe how their genetic investigations found five species of bacteria – three new to science – that were associated with advanced prostate cancer. Men who had one or more of the species in their urine, prostate or tumour tissue were 2.6 times more likely to see their early stage cancer progress to advanced disease than men who did not. Lead scientist Colin Cooper, a professor of cancer genetics at the University of East Anglia, said it was possible the bacteria are not involved in the disease. For example, men with more aggressive prostate cancer may have immune system deficiencies that allow certain bacteria to thrive. But the researchers strongly suspect the microbes are involved, just as Helicobacter pylori infections raise the risk of stomach cancer. “If you knew for sure that a species of bacteria was causing prostate cancer, you could work out an antibiotic to remove it and that would prevent progression, one would hope,” Cooper said. But this is not as straightforward as it sounds, he cautioned. “There are many complications. Antibiotics don’t get into the prostate very well and you would need to choose an antibiotic that only kills certain bacteria,” he said. While prostate cancer is the most common form of the disease found in men, in many cases patients die with the disease rather than because of it. The more aggressive forms of prostate cancer claim about 12,000 lives in the UK each year. Prof Rosalind Eeles, a cancer geneticist on the study at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said it was a “very interesting result” to find “novel micro-organisms” in prostate cancer cases. “It is not yet known if they are causative but if this could be proven then we have a potential route for prevention,” she said. “The way that we may be able to prove this is to look to see if these organisms are never found in prostate samples which have no cancer.” Genetic information on the microbes has already allowed the scientists to piece together how they may behave in the body, including what toxins and other substances they might release. This has led them to develop half a dozen hypotheses around how the bugs could cause prostate cancer. “We currently have no way of reliably identifying aggressive prostate cancers, and this research could help make sure men get the right treatment for them,” Luxton added. “If the team can demonstrate that these newly identified bacteria can not only predict, but actually cause aggressive prostate cancer, for the first time we may actually be able to prevent prostate cancer occurring. This would be a huge breakthrough that could save thousands of lives each year.”",News/Society,Discovery of bacteria linked to prostate cancer hailed as potential breakthrough ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/20/discovery-of-bacteria-linked-to-prostate-cancer-hailed-as-potential-breakthrough
4/20/2022,"Users of self-driving cars will be able to watch films on the motorway under planned changes to the Highway Code, although it will remain illegal to use mobile phones. The update, proposed by the Department for Transport (DfT), will allow those in the driver’s seat to use a car’s built-in screens to watch movies and TV programmes. The new rules also state that insurance companies will be financially liable, rather than individual motorists, for accidents in self-driving cars. However, those behind the wheel must be ready to resume control of the vehicle when they are prompted – such as when they approach motorway exits. These measures were described as an interim measure by the government to support the early deployment of self-driving vehicles. Although there are no vehicles currently approved for self-driving on roads in the UK, the first could be approved later this year. The introduction of the technology is likely to begin with vehicles travelling at slow speeds on motorways, such as in congested traffic. In April 2021, the DfT said it would allow hands-free driving in vehicles with lane-keeping technology on congested motorways. Existing technology, including cruise control and automatic stop/start, is classified as being “assistive”, meaning that users must remain fully in control. Trudy Harrison, a transport minister, said the updates were the result of a public consultation, and would be a “major milestone in our safe introduction of self-driving vehicles”, which would “revolutionise the way we travel”. She added: “This exciting technology is developing at pace right here in Great Britain and we’re ensuring we have strong foundations in place for drivers when it takes to our roads. “In doing so, we can help improve travel for all while boosting economic growth across the nation and securing Britain’s place as a global science superpower.” Steve Gooding, the director of the pro-motoring thinktank RAC Foundation, said: “The Highway Code has been updated a number of times in recent years to reflect the rapidly changing transport world we live in, and these latest additions will help us all understand what we must and must not do as we move forward to an environment where cars drive themselves. “The final part of the jigsaw is to ensure these amendments are widely communicated to, ​and understood by, vehicle owners. Vehicle manufacturers and sellers will have a vital role to play in ensuring their customers fully appreciate the capabilities of the cars they buy and the rules that govern them.” Earlier this year, the Law Commission of England and Wales and the Scots Law commission published a joint report, which recommended the introduction of a new Automated Vehicles Act. The proposals for the act would be that when a car is authorised to be “self-driving”, and those features are in use, the user would no longer be responsible for how the car drives, but rather the company which obtained the authorisation would. Therefore, the user would be unable to be prosecuted for offences that come directly from the driving, and so would be immune to offences that include dangerous driving. The UK, Scottish and Welsh governments are deciding whether to accept the report’s recommendations and bring them into legislation, with the governments expecting to have a full regulatory framework in place to support the widespread deployment of driverless vehicle technology by 2025.",News/Technology,Self-driving car users could watch films on motorway under new DfT proposals,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/20/self-driving-car-users-could-watch-films-on-motorway-under-new-dft-proposals
4/20/2022,"A clearly unhappy Ralf Rangnick branded Manchester United’s 4-0 rout by Liverpool at Anfield as “embarrassing and humiliating”, with Jürgen Klopp’s team pulling two points ahead in the Premier League title race before Manchester City host Brighton on Wednesday. Rangnick made the surprise selection of Phil Jones in an unfamiliar three-man defence which was breached after only five minutes by Luis Díaz. Two goals from Mohamed Salah and a Sadio Mané strike completed a Liverpool league double over United with an aggregate score of 9-0. Rangnick said: “It is embarrassing, it is disappointing, maybe even humiliating. We have to accept they are six years ahead of us now. When Jürgen Klopp came [in October 2015] they changed at the club and lifted not just the team but the club and city to a new level. That is what needs to happen with us in the next transfer windows. “We have to be critical of ourselves. The way we played in the first 45 minutes was in no area what we wanted to see or play. Since we had all our defensive midfielders not available we decided to go with the back five. I made the decision immediately after the Norwich game [a 3-2 win]. Norwich had five or six massive opportunities to score and had it not been for David de Gea we could have conceded three or four. “I don’t think the first half had anything to do with our formation. The way we conceded the first goal was definitely not part of our gameplan. It affected our confidence. The first half was not good enough. We changed from a back five to a back four [at the break] and the first 25 minutes of the second half was better.” The defeat leaves United in sixth place, three points behind Tottenham in fourth, having played a game less, denting their Champions League qualification hopes. “I don’t think they have mentally checked out, it is just a different level,” Rangnick said. “They have better players than we have and this was really reflected by the result today. “There will be a rebuild for sure, that was obvious in the first three or four weeks for me. For us it is extremely embarrassing. We just have to admit they are better than us – I would say they have 25 Formula One cars in their squad. “What I say in the locker room stays there but in general it is similar to what I say now. In the first half we were onlookers to what happens on the pitch, when you play like that against a team like Liverpool. If you cannot get hold of the ball, put a little pressure because we just didn’t attack them, It almost looked as if we were afraid to be outplayed.” While Paul Pogba may miss the next two matches after limping off in the first half, Klopp hailed a “perfect” night for his side. “It was top level, a great night, nothing to moan about football-wise,” he said. Of the 9-0 aggregate score over United, Klopp said: “It is for supporters if they want to celebrate, not for me. I am not here to humiliate the opponent. We started the game better than we finished, in between we had a spell where we had to adjust to the different high‑press system organisation of the opponent [after half-time]. We were clearly better in the first half.” In the seventh minute the whole stadium applauded for Cristiano Ronaldo, whose baby son died on Monday. “My favourite moment,” Klopp said. “Pure class in this moment.”",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick angry after Manchester United’s ‘humiliating’ loss to Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/19/rangnick-humiliated-by-liverpools-latest-rout-of-manchester-united
4/20/2022,"Lautaro Martínez grabbed a first-half double as Internazionale overcame rivals Milan with a 3-0 second-leg and aggregate victory at San Siro. After a goalless draw in the first leg, Inter went ahead after just four minutes here when Martínez smartly turned in Matteo Darmian’s cross at the near post. Milan rallied and Inter keeper Samir Handanovic was forced into fine saves to deny Rafael Leão and Alexis Saelemaekers. The Rossoneri were left to rue those missed chances as Inter doubled their lead five minutes before the interval. It was Argentina forward Martínez on target again, slotting the ball home after being played in by his compatriot Joaquín Correa. Ismaël Bennacer’s 68th-minute strike for Milan was ruled out for offside, before substitute Robin Gosens sealed the win for Simone Inzaghi’s side. “I am happy because we are playing another final,” said Martínez, who has endured a difficult season but was picked by Inzaghi ahead of Edin Dzeko for Tuesday’s match. “There are things said that I don’t like, but I defend this jersey. The club put a lot of faith in me and I try to repay them on the pitch.” The result is a psychological blow for Milan, currently two points clear of a resurgent Inter in the title race. “I don’t think the performance was worthy of a 3-0 but Inter scored at the right times,” said the Milan head coach, Stefano Pioli. “We didn’t lack for effort, intensity or chances but it wasn’t our night.” Inter are one step closer to their first Coppa Italia triumph since 2011, and will face either Juventus or Fiorentina in the final. Juve are 1-0 up after the first leg of their semi-final, with the second leg taking place in Turin on Wednesday. Freiburg struck three times in the first half to win 3-1 at second-tier Hamburg and reach the DFB-Pokal final for the first time in their history. The Hamburg forward Robert Glatzel headed wide when well-placed in the early stages, before Nils Petersen scored on the rebound for the visitors in the 11th minute. Midfielder Nicolas Hoefler doubled the advantage six minutes later, his shot from the edge of the area flying into the roof of the net. Vincenzo Grifo made it 3-0 after just 35 minutes, sending keeper Daniel Heuer Fernandes the wrong way from the penalty spot after a foul on Nico Schlotterbeck. Hamburg saw Anssi Suhonen’s goal disallowed for offside soon after, and could not get on the scoresheet until the 88th minute when Glatzel nodded home.Freiburg, who are fifth in the Bundesliga and just one point outside the Champions League places, will face either RB Leipzig or Union Berlin in the final on 21 May.

Marcus Rashford, Ronaldo’s teammate, said: “Thoughts are with you and Georgina brother I’m so sorry.” Liverpool tweeted: “All of us here at Liverpool FC send our deepest condolences to you, Georgina and the family.” Ronaldo’s former clubs Real Madrid and Juventus each offered their best wishes.

4/20/2022,"An aggregate score of 9‑0 this season is a fair representation of Liverpool’s superiority over Manchester United and the highest number of goals they have scored against their old rivals in a single campaign since 1895‑96, when United were known as Newton Heath. The tale of the two No 6s on display at Anfield encapsulated why such a chasm exists. In the United No 6 was Paul Pogba, an expensive, richly rewarded asset who lasted 10 minutes before limping off injured, perhaps never to be seen playing for the club again before leaving on a free transfer this summer. Wearing Liverpool’s No 6 was Thiago Alcântara, two years Pogba’s senior and radiating the kind of class, composure and vision that underpinned Liverpool’s ascent to the top of the Premier League. He would also hobble off nursing what appeared a tight left hamstring – his laughing embrace with Jürgen Klopp suggested it was not a serious blow – although that followed an 80‑minute performance that left Anfield and his manager drooling. Thiago orchestrated Liverpool’s latest humiliation of the team from Old Trafford, his disguised passes and frequent dissection of United’s hastily arranged formation adding to the sense that Klopp’s side were, to be blunt, extracting the Michael. Alisson had set that tone as early as the third minute when executing a Cruyff turn on Bruno Fernandes inside his own penalty area. Thiago needed no encouragement to pick up the baton. The former Bayern Munich midfielder has timed the best run of form of his Liverpool career to perfection. Ominously for Manchester City, Villarreal, Chelsea and anyone else who stands in the way of Liverpool’s pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple, several of Thiago’s colleagues have also hit their stride as the season enters its defining phase. None more so than Sadio Mané. As in the first‑half destruction of City in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday, Mané epitomised the fight, quality and relentless endeavour of the new Premier League leaders. The Senegal striker was central to both first‑half goals. It was hisfirst‑time ball that sent Mohamed Salah scampering through a badly exposed United defence to cross for Luis Díaz’s opener. His assist for the second was simply sublime. Receiving Joël Matip’s pass at the end of a flowing, one-touch Liverpool move Mané, his back to goal, flicked a glorious chip over a statuesque Harry Maguire into Salah’s run. Having taken so much from the Egypt international in recent months – an Africa Cup of Nations title plus World Cup qualification, both with the decisive spot-kick in a penalty shootout – it was only fair that Mané gave Salah something back. Salah’s confident finish brought him a first goal from open play since the win against Norwich on 19 February. A second completed the rout, and Salah could have had a hat-trick by the time the referee Martin Atkinson called an end to United’s misery. Salah’s timely return to the goals was an added benefit for Klopp beyond the three points he had described as the most important of Liverpool’s lives. Thiago, Mané and Díaz were on a different level to anyone else on the pitch – as they were in the first half against City – with the carelessness and evident lack of belief in the visiting ranks reinforcing the sense of a mismatch. It was not merely Mané’s role in three goals that underlined his enduring value to Klopp’s team. Before sweeping home his 19th club goal of the season, finding the bottom corner of David de Gea’s net with nonchalant ease from Díaz’s cut‑back, his work rate had embarrassed United’s effort. The 30-year-old hassled United from first whistle to last. From the kick‑off he made a beeline for Phil Jones who, through no fault of his own, also showed how far from the Premier League elite his employers have fallen. Jones was handed his second start of the season by Ralf Rangnick following what the interim manager had called an encouraging day’s training with a new three-pronged defensive shape. The formation, and Jones, were abandoned after 45 minutes. The recalled defender has been unlucky with injuries and vindictive personal criticism in recent years. His misfortune here was to be thrust into one of the most high-profile fixtures in the sport, in the midst of Victor Lindelöf and Maguire, against one of the strongest forward lines in world football. One exchange, a minor note in the grand scheme of Liverpool’s victory, was telling. In the 19th minute Jones sprinted out of the backline to stop Mané receiving possession in the Liverpool half. Mané got there first, flicking the ball out to Andy Robertson before spinning into the United half. By the time Robertson returned the pass Mané was 20 yards ahead of Jones and pressurising Nemanja Matic into conceding a needless corner. Minutes later Mané was back in his own half pressurising Aaron Wan-Bissaka into running the ball out of play for a Liverpool throw. Shortly afterwards, he and Thiago combined to do a number on Fernandes in the build-up to a Díaz goal that was disallowed for offside. That is what is so impressive about Liverpool and so galling for the United fans looking on aghast from the Anfield Road Stand. There is tireless graft behind the brilliance of Klopp’s side. United have neither.",Sport/Football,Thiago orchestrates Liverpool’s latest humbling of Manchester United | Andy Hunter,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/19/thiago-orchestrates-liverpools-humiliation-of-manchester-united
