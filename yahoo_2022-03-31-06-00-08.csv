3/31/2022,"McConnell rejected calls for Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from January 6-related SCOTUS cases. ""This performative outrage is not in earnest,"" the GOP leader said. ""This is a political hit."" Several Democratic lawmakers in recent days have called for Thomas to resign from the court. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday decried criticism of Associate Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas over his handling of January 6-related cases, dismissing calls for the jurist to recuse himself or resign as an ""inappropriate pressure campaign."" The Kentucky Republican — who voted to confirm Thomas to Supreme Court in 1991 and played a leading role in installing three conservative jurists to the court during former President Donald Trump's tenure — rejected the concerns as a ""coordinated effort to nullify"" the justice's presence on the court. ""The left's quest to delegitimize the Supreme Court found its latest outlet,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""Washington Democrats are now trying to bully this exemplary judge of 30-plus years out of entire legal subjects, or off the Court entirely."" Last Thursday, The Washington Post and CBS News reported on 29 text messages exchanged between former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Thomas' wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, in which Ginni urged the White House to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Since then, more than two dozen Democratic lawmakers have demanded that Thomas recuse himself from cases concerning the January 6 insurrection and produce a written explanation of his decision to not recuse himself from previous cases before the high court concerning January 6. Prominent legal ethics experts have also expressed concerns that Ginni Thomas' political activities present a conflict of interest for her husband. McConnell broadly dismissed calls by several progressive lawmakers — including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — for Thomas to resign or face impeachment. ""Far-left House members are talking about dusting off their party's impeachment addiction for a third consecutive year,"" he said. ""Make no mistake. This performative outrage is not in earnest. This is a political hit, part of liberals' yearslong quest to delegitimize the Court."" Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday tweeted a scathing indictment of Thomas, stating that his refusal to ""recuse himself from matters involving his wife"" required an investigation. McConnell argued that Democrats have for years sought to ""bully"" conservative justices ""based on spurious accusations about fake ethical problems or partiality."" He called on Thomas to ""ignore"" the most recent criticism. ""This new inappropriate pressure campaign is just a continuation of this well-worn pattern,"" he said. ""It has no basis in Justice Thomas's decades of impeccable service on the bench. The Justice and the entire Court should feel free to ignore it."" McConnell also criticized Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York for his 2020 comments in which the Democratic lawmaker said that Associate Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would ""pay the price"" if they tried to curtail abortion rights. ""In 2020, the Democratic Leader himself stood on the steps of the Supreme Court and threatened multiple sitting Justices by name if they didn't reach the policy outcome that liberals wanted,"" he said.

3/31/2022,"My weight has been increasing steadily and consistently for years, from 82 kgs (180 pounds) in 2014 to upwards of 95 kgs (209 pounds). I felt my health, motivation and fitness all declining. I needed to do something and find someone to help me to train. After some serious consideration, I signed up for a 12-week transformation programme at Ultimate Performance’s Manchester gym. Part of my justification for joining U.P. was that I had never had any kind of training before, or any knowledge of how to work out correctly. So learning how to weight train was a huge learning curve for me. My diet and nutrition were completely overhauled so that I was eating the correct amount of calories my body can use and burn, as well as consuming the right macronutrients and in the right ratios. I also cut out alcohol for the duration of the process. My trainer immediately gave me a diet plan of four meals a day mainly containing proteins (chicken, turkey and beef) and greens.
 For the first 12 weeks, I wholeheartedly committed myself to the training and, after discussing it with my trainer, we agreed three sessions a week would get me the best results. For the 12 weeks following that, I reduced this to two sessions with U.P., as well as two or three sessions on my own. Over my 24 weeks training at U.P., I lost a quarter of my original body weight, dropping 24 kgs (53 pounds) from 96 kgs (212 pounds) to 72 kgs (158 pounds). Also, I started at 29.5% body fat and reduced this b7 19.4% to 10.1%. I went into this process with hypertension blood pressure: now, my blood pressure is in the perfectly normal category. My family were amazed by the transformation, and mentally I am feeling so much better about my own body. After finishing with U.P., my new goal is to make this a permanent lifestyle choice: the way I eat, live, exercise and so on. Nothing is easy about this. But if you commit to yourself, your trainer and your bespoke program, then after the first few weeks when you see the results in the data, your weight dropping, your body fat reducing and your waist shrinking, this fuels your motivation. Once I started to see results, this made me even more determined. There's a popular Chinese proverb that says: “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.” There really is no reason to not do this for yourself.
