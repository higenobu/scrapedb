1/22/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) -An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 jolted southwestern Japan early on Saturday morning, injuring 13 people, the authorities and local media said. No tsunami warning was issued after the quake struck with an epicentre 45 km (30 miles) deep at 1:08 a.m. (1608 GMT on Friday) off the coast of Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's four main islands, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said. The quake caused shaking in Oita and Miyazaki prefectures that measured 5+ on Japan's seismic intensity scale, which has a maximum of 7, the agency said. Thirteen people were injured in nearby regions, including two people in their 80s who were seriously hurt, the Yomiuri newspaper reported, citing local authorities. Multiple reports of damage to buildings, water pipes and roads have been confirmed, said public broadcaster NHK. No abnormalities were reported at the Ikata nuclear power plant, operated by Shikoku Electric Power, or the Sendai plant operated by Kyushu Electric Power in southern Japan, the Nuclear Regulation Authority said. ""In the past, 10% to 20% of strong earthquakes were followed by a quake of the same level, so be aware of another quake of up to 5+ intensity scale in regions that experienced large jolts, for around a week,"" the JMA said in a statement.

1/22/2022,"This is an excerpt from The Royal Tea, BuzzFeed News' newsletter about the royal family. You can sign up here. The Queen could find herself celebrating her 70th year on the British throne without all of her family by her side, as Prince Harry has claimed that it’s too dangerous for the Sussexes to visit the UK under the current security arrangements. What does Harry want to protect his wife and children that his hired bodyguards can’t currently provide in the UK? There’s one obvious, all-American answer: guns. Unbeknownst to the public, for months the Duke of Sussex has been petitioning the UK government to allow him to pay for police protection for himself and his family while they are in the country. Harry was stripped of police security when he and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, stepped back from life as working members of the royal family in 2019 — now he’s willing to pursue legal action in order to get it back. On Jan. 16, the Mail on Sunday reported that Harry’s lawyers filed a request for a judicial review of the UK Home Office’s decision to bar the Sussexes from police protection. Depending on the results of the review, the matter could go before a High Court judge. In response to what the Sussexes’ spokesperson called “a leak in a UK tabloid, with surreptitious timing,” they quickly released a statement to set “the facts right.” “Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for life,” the spokesperson said. “He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats. While his role within the institution has changed, his profile as a member of the royal family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable to return to his home.” The spokesperson said the duke’s security was compromised due to the absence of police protection while leaving a charity event during a visit to the UK in July — although no additional information was given, even after a further request by BuzzFeed News, about exactly what happened during this supposed 2021 security breach. After a subsequent failed attempt at negotiations with the Home Office, the Sussexes’ lawyers filed the formal request for judicial review in September. “As is widely known, others who have left public office and have an inherent threat risk receive police protection at no cost to them. The goal for Prince Harry has been simple – to ensure the safety of himself and his family while in the UK so his children can know his home country,” said the spokesperson. Of course, like any Harry and Meghan news, this sparked a media firestorm. Sussex critics accused Harry of overinflating the threat and seeking royal perks after rejecting official royal work. Sussex supporters pointed to Princess Diana’s lack of official police protection following her divorce and the role that may have played in her death. Harry’s claim that he, Meghan, and their two small children can’t be safe in the UK without police officers guarding their backs may seem a bit odd when you consider the fact that the country’s rich and famous live in safety with their private security teams. But private security guards in the UK cannot carry guns. Until last year, Harry had always been protected in the UK by an elite — and armed — branch of the Metropolitan Police Service known as SO14, or the Royalty Protection Group. These taxpayer-funded guards provide 24/7 protection to the high-profile members of the royal family (the Queen, Prince Charles, the Cambridge family) and accompany other members of the royal family further down in the line of succession to official events and visits. Only a select group of high-profile individuals, such as current and former prime ministers and foreign heads of state, are allowed to have police protection (and therefore armed protection) in the UK — and the Home Office must give its consent. “Firearms are not an acceptable means of protection in Great Britain,” the December 2021 Home Office guide on firearm licensing states. “It has been the view of successive governments for many years that the private possession and carriage of firearms for personal protection is likely to lead to an increase in levels of violence.” That’s not to say that police won't protect the Sussexes in a time of crisis. UK police are required by law to inform individuals if they’re aware of a threat to their life; it stands to reason that any potential threats would be reported to the Sussexes’ security team and officers would intervene if necessary. As it stands, Harry has given every indication that he will not bring his wife and children to the UK unless he has police protection. Allowing him to pay for police security would be a groundbreaking precedent that could open the doors for other high-profile private individuals to make their own legal challenges. A Sussex spokesperson declined to comment on the ongoing legal matter and referred BuzzFeed News to their previous statement. Buckingham Palace referred BuzzFeed News to the Home Office, which declined to comment on security matters. The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this summer will mark one of the biggest events in the history of the British monarchy and a golden opportunity for the Mountbatten-Windsor family to present a united front after a turbulent year. Yet in a strange twist of fate, the decision that may determine whether or not the family will stand together on the Buckingham Palace balcony during the Jubilee celebrations could be made not by the Queen, but by the UK government.

1/22/2022,"A California mother and so, who plunged to their deaths from theconcourse level of Petco Park during a San Diego Padres game last September was ruled a murder-suicide, police said. The deaths of Racquel Wilkins, 40, and her 2-year-old son, Denzel Browning-Wilkins, were determined to be non-accidental following an “exhaustive investigation,” according to a San Diego Police Department press release. The mother and son died after falling several stories from the Major League Baseball stadium in San Diego. A preliminary autopsies has since concluded the mother and son’s September deaths were the result of a murder-suicide. ""In consultation with the San Diego County Medical Examiner, Raquel Wilkins' death has been classified a suicide and Denzel Browning-Wilkins' death has been classified a homicide,"" Lt. Andra Brown, a public information officer for the San Diego Police Department said in a statement sent to Oxygen.com on Thursday. ""The detectives conducted a thorough and comprehensive investigation that included dozens of interviews, reviewing available video footage and collecting background information to determine what led to the deaths.” The tragic incident unfolded just prior to an afternoon game between the San Diego Padres and the Atlanta Braves on Sept. 25, 2021. Shortly before 4 p.m., on-duty San Diego police officers stationed at Petco Park received reports that two people had possibly fallen from the concourse level of the baseball stadium — which is about six stories up — along the third base line. A pair of officers later discovered Wilkins and her 2-year-old son’s bodies on the sidewalk at 200 Tony Gwynn Drive. Both Raquel Wilkins and Denzel Browning-Wilkins were pronounced dead at the scene, despite first responders’ attempts to revive them both. Homicide investigators were called to the scene after police deemed the mother and son’s deaths suspicious. Detectives subsequently learned Wilkins and her toddler son had been eating in Petco Park’s dining and concessions area on the third-level of the ballpark shortly before the deadly fall. A witness told the San Diego Union-Tribune that Wilkins had stood up on the bench of a picnic table near the railing with her son and jumped up and down in two separate incidents before going over the railing the second time. ""The woman started jumping on the bench of the table closest to the railing, holding the baby in her arms,"" the unnamed witness said in a statement to the paper. ""She seemed happy — laughing."" The witness said the woman fell off the bench and landed by the picnic table, but got up again within a minute and began bouncing, after which she went over the railing.  The witness heard the sound of the pair landing and left without speaking to police. She told the paper that the man with them, who appeared to be the child's father, watched them fall and appeared to be in shock. The paper confirmed with the family and police that the child's father was with them at the park at the time. Wilkins, the Union-Tribune said, had announced her engagement to the man on Facebook just before her death. It’s unclear what may have led to or triggered the murder-suicide. The San Diego Police Department declined to comment further on the open case on Thursday.

Photo: Getty Images  Authorities said the 40-year-old mother and son were both residents of San Diego. Their family members have since been notified of the murder-suicide ruling, police, and have requested privacy. Wilkins' parents have filed a wrongful death suit against the city and Petco Park, ESPN reported, and plan to file a tort against the city this week. Their lawyer ""expressed disappointment"" that the police hadn't been more forthcoming with the family about the investigation or how they reached their conclusions. Law enforcement officials also stated tip lines were flooded with information from concerned citizens and other ballpark spectators for weeks after news of the tragedy involving Wilkins and her son broke in September. “[San Diego Police Department] understands the public’s concern and interest in this tragedy that happened publicly in a venue where the community gathers,” police added. “We would like to thank all those who came forward with information. The San Diego Padres also lamented the loss of life stemming from the murder-suicide on Thursday. “We want to reiterate our deepest sympathy and condolences to the family of those involved in this tragedy,” a spokesperson for the Major League franchise said in a statement sent to Oxygen.com. Anyone with additional information regarding Wilkins’ and her son’s deaths are urged to call the San Diego Police Department’s Homicide Unit at 619-531-2293 or by submitting an anonymous tip via Crime Stoppers by calling 888-580-8477.",U.S./Oxygen,San Diego Mom And Son's Fatal Fall At September Padres Game Ruled Murder-Suicide,https://news.yahoo.com/san-diego-mom-sons-fatal-175400937.html
