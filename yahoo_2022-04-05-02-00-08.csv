4/5/2022,"A Fort Lauderdale personal injury attorney has been hit with an emergency suspension from the Florida Bar after, security video and witnesses say she drove her Kia into four people on a sidewalk outside The Fresh Market, according to Stuart police. When officers stopped Beatrice Bijoux, they say she told them she meant to hit the people. She wasn’t trying to drum up business, but, rather “voices in her head had told her to kill the people,” an arrest report said. Bijoux, who has been held without bond in Martin County Jail since the Feb. 22 incident, pleaded not guilty to one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, one count of high speed or wanton fleeing and four counts of attempted murder. On March 21, the state Supreme Court granted the Bar’s request of emergency suspension for Bijoux, who was admitted to the Bar in 2016. Tampa area man behind the wheel of a driving school’s car was twice the DUI limit, FHP says Both Bijoux’s Bar address and her law firm’s website says her firm’s main office is in Fort Lauderdale, but the arrest report says she lives in Stuart. After Stuart police answered a 12:52 p.m. 911 call from The Fresh Market at 2300 SE Ocean Blvd., the report said, one person who had been hit had been airlifted to a hospital and three people were still there. Two people who had been sitting at a table said the car hopped the curb and pushed them about three to four feet into the wall behind them. The woman flown to the hospital said she didn’t see the car heading for her, but knew it was a black car after it hit her. Police said the surveillance video showed a black Kia hitting people on the sidewalk at about 30 to 35 mph, then “reversing at a high rate of speed.” The driver tried to hit another person, police said, but he was able to leap to safety. The report says a witness followed the Kia, which carried a Texas license plate. Bijoux didn’t stop for police on the street, instead driving to the Stuart Police Department and parking her car. “When Bijoux exited the vehicle, she immediately told Sgt. Reddick that the voices in her head had told her to kill the people,” the report said. After her arrest, the report says Bijoux said she wanted to kill other people, wanted to kill the people she hit, wanted to kill herself and even the 4-year-old niece who lives with her part time.. She claimed she was under a doctor’s care, but hadn’t spoken to her doctor since December. She’d never wanted to hurt other people before, but “could not explain why today was different.” She asked a police lieutenant what the charges were. When told aggravated battery, the report said, “she immediately said that she cannot believe that she is only being charged with that due to the fact that she wanted to kill those people.” Self-harm, especially to the point of taking your own life, is never a good answer to life problems. If you feel like self-harm, talk to someone.

4/5/2022,"STORY: Global outrage spread on Monday (April 4) at civilian killings in north Ukraine, including evidence of bound bodies shot at close range and a mass grave found in areas retaken from Russian troops. Taras Shapravskyi, deputy mayor of Bucha, around 25 miles northwest of Kyiv, said 50 bodies found after Kremlin forces withdrew late last week were the victims of extra-judicial killings by Russian troops. This report contains graphic images of some of those bodies. Reuters could not independently verify the number of dead or who was responsible. Ukraine's foreign minister called on the International Criminal Court to collect evidence of Russian war crimes, a term also used by French President Emmanuel Macron. In Bucha, a man lay sprawled by the roadside, with his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head. A mass grave at a church remained open, with hands and feet poking through red clay heaped on top. Ukrainian authorities said they had found 421 civilian casualties near Kyiv by Sunday. The images from Bucha looked set to galvanize the United States and Europe into fresh sanctions against Moscow. And to overshadow peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, due to restart by video link on Monday. The Kremlin categorically denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians in Bucha and said Ukrainian allegations on the matter should be treated with doubt. Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said the images were staged. ""The other day another fake attack was undertaken in the town of Bucha in the Kyiv region, after the Russian military had left according to plans and agreements. Several days later, a fake video was staged. That is now is being spread through all media channels and social media by Ukrainian representatives and their Western patrons."" Adding to the mounting accusations - the head of the village of Motyzhyn, her husband and son were shot and buried in a shallow grave, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry said, showing their partially covered bodies in the sand. One had his head taped. Reuters couldn't independently verify who killed the family. A Reuters reporter also saw another body of a man in a well near a burnt-out farm. He appeared to have been tied up. The United States will ask the U.N. General Assembly to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said on Monday.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Global outcry at civilian killings near Kyiv,https://news.yahoo.com/global-outcry-civilian-killings-near-162506753.html

Four days after her last known contact, Musgrove was reported missing, according to a news release from the Iron County Sheriff’s Office. It was reported she “went on a hiking trip and hasn’t returned.” Deputies, alongside about 25 other agencies from Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota, searched the area using “extensive ground, air, and water” resources. Her body was found Sunday, April 3, near Potato River Falls, officials said. That was eight days after she contacted someone to say she had reached the waterfall. Musgrove’s cause of death is under investigation, though authorities say foul play is not suspected. “We would like to express our sincere condolences to Kelsey’s family,” the sheriff’s office said. Musgrove was a cardiothoracic surgery fellow with the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health’s Department of Surgery. The three-year fellowship program provides doctors “with the skills and knowledge to begin a career as a cardiothoracic surgeon.” UW Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment from McClatchy News on April 4.
