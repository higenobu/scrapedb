2/25/2022,"When it comes to protecting the rights of trans youth in Texas, stars are getting on their digital soapboxes. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a directive Tuesday ordering the state child welfare agency to investigate reports of “gender-transitioning procedures” as child abuse. The move comes one day after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a written opinion defining gender-affirming care as child abuse under state laws – and months after state lawmakers considered but did not pass similar bills when the Legislature met last year. Transgender advocates accused Abbott and Paxton of twisting state law to meet their political goals and biases, particularly after efforts to define gender-affirming medical care as child abuse died last year in the Texas House after passage in the Senate. Many celebrities, including Gabrielle Union, Kerry Washington, Jamie Lee Curtis and Elliot Page have also joined the growing conversation on social media. Background: Texas governor orders state agency to treat gender-affirming care as child abuse Will parents of transgender children be investigated in Texas? Governor's order sparks fear, uncertainty. Elliot Page, who came out as transgender in 2020, said he was ""horrified by the inhumane and downright dangerous declarations."" ""Trans youth deserve gender-affirming care and to be able to live their true, authentic selves without fear and oppression,"" the actor said in a statement to Variety. ""I stand with trans youth and their families.” “This is where we are,” Union tweeted Tuesday. “We shot past dangerous and horrific a long time ago. The rubber has hit the road so who is standing shoulder to shoulder in this fight?” Trans inclusivity is a cause close to Union's heart. The ""Bring It On"" star's 14-year-old stepdaughter, Zaya, came out as transgender in February 2020. This is where we are. We shot past dangerous and horrific a long time ago. The rubber has hit the road so who is standing shoulder to shoulder in this fight? Who truly gives a sh*t and whose on that performative bs? Let's see. https://t.co/WEFH0xETGw — Gabrielle Union (@itsgabrielleu) February 23, 2022 Union previously told USA TODAY that she and husband Dwyane Wade have raised their children to ""stick up for people"" and ""say something,"" much like themselves. The trans community can't stop reading horrific news. There's a way to turn away.More:2022 could be most anti-trans legislative years in history, report says Washington wrote on Twitter that Gov. Abbott's gender care order was ""horrific."" “My heart goes out to the entire Trans community of Texas and their families,” the ""Scandal"" actress continued. “Texas, this is happening in your state. Now is the time to use your voice and your VOTE.” Horrific. My heart goes out to the entire Trans community of Texas and their families. Texas, this is happening in your state.

This isn’t leadership. It’s hate.” This is pure evil. Cruelty isn’t a policy. Bigotry is not leadership.

Every single one of you,” alternative pop duo Tegan and Sara wrote, in reference to Abbott and “every single adult obsessively fixating on hurting trans youth.” “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” host Andy Cohen used his social media platform to raise awareness, sharing a Twitter thread containing a copy of Abbott’s directive. 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇 https://t.co/KSdtPGq6fi — Andy Cohen (@Andy) February 23, 2022 “As a mother of a trans person I'm am outraged!,” tweeted actress Jamie Lee Curtis, who revealed in a July 2021 AARP magazine interview that her 25-year-old daughter Ruby is a trans woman. At the time, Curtis said she and her husband Christopher Guest were watching with ""wonder and pride"" as Ruby transitioned. In an October 2021 interview with People, the ""Halloween Kills"" actress said she's still learning from her daughter. ""It's speaking a new language,"" Curtis told the outlet.

My heart is with the families that are effected by this heinous order. #protecttranskids — Elijah Wood (@elijahwood) February 23, 2022 Texas Freedom Network President Val Benavidez said the state action could deny ""life-saving care for transgender youth."" “Transgender people already experience stigma and discrimination, harassment and violence simply because of who they are,” Benavidez said, adding that politicians are using vulnerable youths as political pawns. “Regardless of opposition from child welfare and medical groups, Paxton and the Texas GOP continue to create barriers and laws that strip transgender children and their families of civil and equal rights.” Equality Texas, an LGBTQ advocacy group, said all children deserve to grow up healthy and learn to take care of their bodies in a way that helps them live full, happy lives. ""For transgender kids, this might include gender-affirming care that has been endorsed by pediatricians and proven to help kids’ mental health and future well-being,"" the organization said in a statement.

At a press briefing, Markarova said, ""Just before I came here, we got information from our chief commander that one of the platoons of the 74th motorized brigade from Kemerovo Oblast surrendered.""

2/25/2022,"A single quarter could be worth more than $200 — and it has nothing to do with inflation. See: The Tricky Business of Reselling — and How You Can Get Good at It
Find: 5 Smartest Things To Do With Your Spare Change The U.S. Sun recently reported that a rare quarter — minted in the year 2000 with an error on it — has sold for $216 on eBay. The coin is part of the state Washington quarters series featuring New Hampshire, but it was struck onto a Jefferson nickel. But that’s not the most expensive rare coin, the U.S. Sun reports. Rare Washington quarters minted in 1932 can sell for as much as $13,573, according to USA Coin Book. Errors and rare mintages give coins the highest re-sale value, per The U.S. Sun.

Error coins — like the Washington quarter which recently sold for $216 — are sometimes called double denominations or “planchet” errors. That’s because the mistake occurs to a blank coin (a “planchet”) during the minting process. The U.S. Sun explained that errors can happen when the wrong planchet is fed into the minting press, or the machine contains dies of different denominations, and a mix-up occurs. If you are the type of person who tosses your spare change into a jar, bowl, or piggy bank in your home, it could be worth sorting through your coins to see if you have any of value. If you don’t have a place where you keep your spare change, it’s worth searching under couch cushions, in your car, and anywhere change could collect. On your hunt for rare coins, first look for any that seem unusual, such as a design you’ve never seen, an error where the print looks “off,” or the wrong denomination printed on the coin.
