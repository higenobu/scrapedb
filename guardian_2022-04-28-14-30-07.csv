4/28/2022,"Was you or were you having your tea, dinner or supper last night? Before it, were you feeling clammish, clemmed, starving, hungry, leary or just plain clempt? Are you still whanging in Yorkshire? Haining in Somerset? Hocksing in Cambridgeshire? Hoying in Durham? Pegging in Cheshire? Pelting in Northamptonshire? Yarking in Leicestershire? Or do you throw now? How do you pronounce scone? Researchers from the University of Leeds are interested in answers to all such questions as they embark on a heritage project to help explore and preserve England’s dialects. Details have been announced of how the university plans to use its prized archive of English life and language that was gathered by Leeds University fieldworkers in the 1950s and 1960s. The results remain the most famous and complete survey of dialects in England. The university said it was making its extensive library of English dialects accessible to the public through the launch of The Great Big Dialect Hunt. It said researchers would be searching for “new phrases and expressions to bring the archive into the 21st century and preserve today’s language for future generations”. Fiona Douglas, from the university’s department of English, who is leading the project, stressed they were not trying to repeat the scale of the original survey, in which fieldworkers went out to interview people over the age of 65 in more than 300 mostly rural communities. “It was very, very big and there were many, many questions,” she said. The results, which include many photographs and audio, amount to a fabulously rich snapshot of how people in England lived and talked. If you want a regional map of what a cowhouse or freckles or chip pan scraps were called across England, they are in the archive. In the case of scraps, there are 50 variants from craps and cratchings to scratch and scratchings. Leeds researchers want to know whether some words are out of date. So do you give someone a piggyback or a pick-a-pack, cuddycaddy, callycode, colliebucky or backy? If you are from East Anglia, would you describe a lop-sided shelf as being “slightly on the huh”, and would you refer to more than two of something as a “couple of three”? An interactive audio sound map of England allows people to hear how people talked in different areas when the survey was gathered. “The recordings are just phenomenal because it is people talking about their lives and experiences, so it is a window on the past as well as you get to hear these fantastic voices,” said Douglas. She said the new project could better be described as a “mini-survey” and, importantly, was not confined to older voices. “We would like everybody to fill in our survey. It doesn’t matter where you are from or how long you’ve lived there, or whether you think you’ve got a dialect or not.” The website will allow people to add their own voices and words to the archive. The university is partnering with five museums across England where people can physically go to add dialects. The project is funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, which gave £530,500 to digitise the notebooks, photographs, word maps and audio recordings from the original fieldwork. “We’d like to share what we’ve got but we’re also interested in the dialects people have now because they are not something preserved in aspic,” said Douglas. “It’s not just something from the past.” The death of dialects has been predicted since the 18th century but Douglas said they were still here, thriving and evolving. Hearing someone with a strong twang was always a thrill, she said. “It transports you. There is something absolutely visceral about it which makes you think: oh wow, I’m home, or these people are like me. “A lot of it is about that sense of connectedness, a sense of belonging, a sense of rootedness, and even in our 24/7 global digitally overgrown world I think that really matters.”",News/Science,Still whanging?

4/28/2022,"Despite its name, Greenland is mostly a land of snow and ice, with four-fifths of the country covered by an ice sheet. Yet its northernmost point, Peary Land (named after the explorer Robert Peary, widely credited as being the first person to reach the north pole), is actually ice free, because the air is so dry that snow does not fall there, making it a polar desert. As the world’s largest island, with a land area of more than 2m sq km, Greenland stretches over 34 degrees of latitude, from 83 degrees north to 60 degrees north – roughly level with the Shetland Islands. Three-quarters of Greenland lies within the Arctic Circle, so the summers are brief and cool, while the winters are long and very cold. The town of Qaanaaq (also known as Thule) is one of the most northerly in the world, with average temperatures of just 5Cin July, plummeting to -25Cin February. Farther south, in the capital, Nuuk, temperatures are a few degrees higher. Greenland holds the unenviable record of the lowest temperature ever recorded in the northern hemisphere. In December 1991, near the summit of the Greenland ice sheet, it fell to -69.6C. But with the onset of the climate crisis, summer temperatures in the high 20s are now being recorded; an ominous sign for the future.",News/News,How the climate crisis is changing Greenland’s weather,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/28/greenland-changing-weather-climate-crisis
4/28/2022,"The UK government is set to announce a fourth delay to physical checks on fresh food imported from the EU amid industry reports that neither technology nor infrastructure resources were ready for the July start of the next phase of Brexit. The Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, is expected to frame the move as use of the UK’s newfound independent powers to control the trade border since the departure from the EU and the single market. He is also expected to say it is a response to supply chain fears in a trading environment already hit by the Ukraine war and cost of living crisis. The delays could push back the full implementation of Brexit controls until 2023, sources said, with physical checks removed and a potential relaxation on the requirement for import of products, animals, food and feed system (IPAFFS) paperwork. Earlier this month an outage in a key post-Brexit IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement Service (GVMS), combined with the halting of P&O ferry routes, led to long delays for freight traffic trying to cross the Channel. Industry sources said small suppliers in the EU were not prepared for physical border checks or capable of getting the veterinary certificates that would be required on fresh food ranging from artisan cheese to olive oil and dried meats from countries such as Spain and Italy. “EU suppliers are going to be hit in exactly the same way as British fish and food suppliers were last year. The difference here is that the UK has no way of helping the EU suppliers,” said one industry representative. Another said: “This is good news as far as we are concerned. They have obviously had problems with GVMS in general and they don’t want egg on their faces.” Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks have been operational in all EU countries with which the UK shares a border, including France, Belgium and Ireland, since the Brexit withdrawal agreement was implemented on 1 January 2021. The cliff-edge approach left exporters of fish and other fresh food in chaos with a lack of customs agents and veterinary staff to certify whether the produce complied with EU standards. But in the UK post-Brexit checks on fresh food were not implemented for imports, being pushed back in 2020 and on two occasions in 2021. Under the current border plan, physical checks on meat were due to start on 1 July and on dairy on 1 September, with all remaining foods including fish and composite foods to be subject to checks from 1 November.",News/Politics,Rees-Mogg set to delay post-Brexit fresh food checks for fourth time,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/jacob-rees-mogg-delay-post-brexit-eu-fresh-food-checks-fourth-time
4/28/2022,"In a park on the edge of Antwerp, a low, doughnut-shaped building stands among the trees, looking like a friendly flying saucer nestled in a clearing. On one side, the large windows of a kindergarten open on to a raised terrace where kids play with a view of all the greenery. On the other, a zig-zagging wooden canopy shelters the park’s maintenance depot, full of trailers, gardening tools and staff facilities. It may sound like an unlikely pairing under a single roof, but it brings benefits for both. A huge panoramic picture window in the kindergarten courtyard gives the children a front-row seat for a live, Bob the Builder-ish show of pick-up trucks, diggers and lawnmowers, their floor raised for a better view. Meanwhile, daycare staff and park-keepers share a dining room and rest area, meaning the spaces are more generous than if they were built for one group alone. The architecture elevates the two, its simple materials and crisp detailing lifting the structure beyond the quality of your usual municipal park shed. Designed by Brussels-based architects 51N4E, this little building is one of more than 300 public commissions built in Flanders over the last two decades through a remarkable process known as the Open Oproep of the Vlaams Bouwmeester, or the Open Call of the Flemish Government Architect, to use the much less fun-sounding translation. Unlikely as it may seem, the scheme has made this small part of northern Belgium home to some of the best new public buildings in the world. From an octagonal social housing scheme and a sculptural water silo to a pastoral care home campus, the diverse range of projects appear in a new book, Celebrating Public Architecture, which highlights 70 examples from the recent “wonder years” of Flemish civic design. It is an astonishing output for a region of six million people, featuring elegant libraries and special educational needs schools, as well as dramatic concert halls and bridges – in a place once derided as “the ugliest country in the world”. That was the verdict of Belgian architect and urban planner Renaat Braem. He wasn’t alone. In the 1961 book The New Architecture of Europe, US art historian GE Kidder Smith was just as blunt. “Of all European countries, Belgium is least to be excused for not contributing more to contemporary architecture,” he wrote. “Having a thoroughly literate and capable population and an extremely high living standard, the mediocrity of its architecture can be explained only by the indifference of its officials, the inadequacy of its educational system, and a flabby materialism.” There’s a reason why the blog Ugly Belgian Houses has become a cult hit: there are a lot to choose from. But the last two decades have seen a quiet revolution. The about-turn is credited to a momentous occasion in the late 1990s, when then finance minister Wivina Demeester had to inaugurate two new government buildings in the northern quarter of Brussels – an area notorious for its grimly mundane office blocks. She was so appalled by what she found there that she spurred her fellow ministers into action, establishing the position of government architect in 1999, with the appointment of Bob Van Reeth, who launched the first Open Call soon after. Unlike the toxic culture of open international competitions, which see countless architects waste days of unpaid labour to compete in a beauty contest of novelty forms, the Open Call is focused – and paid. Twice a year, projects are announced, ranging from museums and offices to dementia care homes and crematoriums. Rather than draw up a design, architects submit a statement of intent and samples of their work, from which the Bouwmeester’s team selects 10 – a mix of larger and smaller firms, both local and international. The democratic process has seen Pritzker prize winners drawn alongside recent graduates, unheard-of elsewhere. The client then invites three to seven of the firms to meet at the site, discuss the project, and develop a design – with all participants paid. It is a discursive, collaborative approach, focused on selecting the right team rather than a final design. As Florian Heilmeyer, editor of Celebrating Public Architecture, notes: “It is precisely this emphasis on architecture as a shared creative process that sets the open call apart.” The results are richer for it. The kindergarten and park depot were originally going to be two separate buildings until discussions during the Open Call made the municipality realise it could make savings and end up with a better building for both parties if it combined the two. Similarly, the brief for a new administrative centre in Oostkamp, on the site of an industrial shed, didn’t specify retaining the existing building until Spanish architect Carlos Arroyo showed how the shed could be radically reborn – and save tonnes of embodied carbon in the process. As well as the many ingenious background buildings, quietly improving unloved corners of Flemish towns, the book also shows how the Open Call has spawned the occasional municipal icon, too. Xaveer de Geyter conjured a twisting harlequin tower studded with triangular windows for the province of Antwerp’s headquarters, while Coussée & Goris and RCR Arquitectes built a brooding steel nest for De Krook library in Ghent. Zaha Hadid’s characteristically bombastic Havenhuis port authority building in Antwerp may not be to everyone’s tastes but the client is apparently thrilled with its dramatically cantilevered home. One notable feature of the book, from a British perspective, is quite how many UK-based architects have found opportunities to build in Flanders, in a way that would be unimaginable back home. From Sergison Bates’s library in Blankenberge, to Witherford Watson Mann’s courtyard and social housing in Gistel, to Tony Fretton’s town hall in Deinze, these practices all realised bigger-scale public projects earlier in their careers than they could have dreamed of building in Britain. It’s not hard to see why, given the current state of UK procurement culture. As the Grenfell inquiry has made all too clear in week after depressing week, the process through which public authorities procure building work has become riddled with lethal incompetence and institutionalised negligence. It is a process of contractual buck-passing that sees a project divided into numerous separate “packages”, from which the maximum number of consultants can profit – while the public loses out on quality, safety and value. For architects, it is a closed shop. If you want to build a school or a hospital you have to have built one before, ideally several. Your office has to be of a certain size, meet onerous minimum turnover requirements and have a costly level of professional indemnity insurance even to be considered. The result is that the same big corporate firms win the bulk of the projects, with little scope for innovation, as younger, smaller practices are shut out. The same is true in many countries, particularly the even more risk-averse and litigious US, where young architects are mostly confined to a life of retail fit-outs, exhibition designs or private houses until they turn 60. The Open Call represents a different way forward, one that public authorities everywhere would do well to learn from. The UK government, in its misguided quest to introduce “beauty” into the planning regime, is focusing on completely the wrong target. The problems facing British cities and regions have little to do with style but everything to do with how the built environment is procured, created and maintained – with lasting consequences for us all.

4/28/2022,"The number of children in custody in England and Wales is expected to double by 2024, according to a report by Whitehall’s public spending watchdog, which also highlights that black and minority ethnic children are increasingly over-represented in the youth justice system. The National Audit Office (NAO) report said in 2021 more than half (53%) of children in custody were from minority ethnic groups, up from less than a third (32%) 10 years earlier, while the proportion of black children increased from 18% to 29% over the same period. The report said that after long-term decline, the number of children in custody is expected to rise rapidly as a direct result of increased police recruitment, moves to tackle the court backlog caused by Covid and tougher sentencing after the passing of the police, crime, sentencing and courts reform bill. According to the NAO, the average number of children in custody fell by 73% in the decade up to 2021, reflecting the decline in the number of youth offences. Latest forecasts, however, indicate the number of children aged 15-17 in young offender institutions (YOIs) will double from 343 in 2021 to 700 just four years later, raising concerns about capacity in the system. Almost three-quarters of all children in custody are held in a YOI, while those who are deemed too vulnerable are housed in secure training centres (STCs) or secure children’s homes. Inspectors have raised persistent concerns over the welfare, safety and outcomes for children in England’s three STCs, and closures have led to children being moved to less suitable types of youth custody. The government has promised to deliver two new secure schools to try to improve the life chances of children in custody, but according to the NAO, the opening of the first has been delayed by approximately three years, while costs have gone up from £4.9m to £36.5m, after significant design revisions following due diligence. “Due to wider financial constraints, Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service has not started work on the second secure school,” the report notes. Dame Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said it was a crisis in the making. “Years of mismanagement and poor performance has meant the youth justice system risks failing many of the children who end up in custody. “Persistent concerns over the STCs have not been heeded, and now their closures have led to vulnerable children being sent to other facilities which aren’t as suitable for their complex needs.” She added: “Children in custody are expected to double by 2024, yet new facilities are delayed and existing ones are failing to meet standards. Without proper support, the chances of these children to turn their lives around is distressingly slim.” Andrew Neilson, the director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: “When a child is in trouble, we should do all that we can to keep them safe and guide them away from crime. This is why it is so concerning that, after a decade in which the number of children in custody has been reduced by 80%, recent policy decisions risk sweeping more boys and girls into our failing criminal justice system.” He said the growing racial disparities in youth justice have been of increasing concern to the Howard League. “Ministers need to get serious on how the government will reverse this unacceptable state of affairs.” A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “We are committed to ensuring public safety and the best possible outcome for every child in our care. Our new secure school will put education, healthcare and rehabilitation at the heart of our efforts to cut crime and keep the public safe.” ",News/Law,Number of children in custody in England and Wales set to double by 2024,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/28/number-children-in-custody-england-wales-national-audit-office-report

4/28/2022,"When I heard, earlier this month, that the fine-art photographer Ingrid Pollard had made the shortlist for the Turner prize, potentially the most career-changing of art accolades, I was overjoyed, but also astonished. Overjoyed because her art deserves this level of recognition; astonished because it has taken this long for Pollard, whom I have known for 40 years and is well into her 60s, to take her place in the spotlight. The sculptor Veronica Ryan also made the list. Like Pollard, she has had a sustained career as an artist since the 80s. I delight in the fact that Black female creatives in their 50s and 60s are having a moment. Just this week, it was announced that Sonia Boyce, who also came of age in the 80s and is representing Britain at the Venice Biennale with her exhibition Feeling Her Way, had won the prestigious Golden Lion for best national exhibition. Likewise, Simone Leigh, representing the US, was awarded the Golden Lion for best participant for her bronze sculpture Brick House. They are both, shockingly, the first Black women to represent their countries since the biennale’s founding 127 years ago. In other news, Everlyn Nicodemus, who is in her 60s, will shortly be the first Black woman to have a self-portrait on display in the National Portrait Gallery (established 1856) as part of a scheme to improve female representation in the gallery. What took them so long? There are those who balk at the idea of paying too much attention to these milestones, as if they are not relevant, but they are, they are. In addressing the historical exclusion of some demographics in creative settings, we need to know what we are up against. Often, it is only when we crunch the numbers and see the stats laid out before us in black and white on a spreadsheet that the disparity in representation becomes glaringly obvious. Recent research in the US revealed that 85% of artists featured in prominent permanent exhibitions are white, while 87% of them are male. I imagine the British story is similar. Certainly, during the first 30 years of the Turner prize (established 1984), it was awarded to 25 male artists – indicative of a male-controlled arts culture that, for most of history, as the predominant arbiter of what constitutes excellence, relevance and importance, placed greater value on the aesthetics, context and, yes, politics of art produced by men. To those who protest that women were not producing good enough work, it is simply not true. It is all about the value placed on art, and by whom. All of the women mentioned here are, in my opinion, outstanding creatives, offering unique talents and perspectives not offered elsewhere. Quality, however we define it, always comes first. The Black male artists Isaac Julien, Steve McQueen, Chris Ofili and Yinka Shonibare gained international reputations more than 20 years ago – deservedly so – but Black female creatives have had to operate within not just a white context, but also a patriarchal one. For example, the powerful figurative portrayals of Black women by Claudette Johnson, another 80s alumna, didn’t have a hope in hell of garnering the attention they deserved until recently, via a significant exhibition in 2019 at Modern Art Oxford. In the catalogue, she explained her raison d’etre: “A very long time ago I started thinking about how women take up space in the world. And about the space assigned to Black women within the media and within British society; I think it is a very small, twisted space that is offered. So I usually invite sitters to take up space in a way that is reflective of who they are and how they would naturally move or stand.” If I compare the figurative paintings of Lucian Freud with Johnson’s, I know that I would place more value – aesthetic, cultural, financial – on her art. Freud’s reputation has long been embedded in our culture. His painting of Sue Tilley sold for £17.2m in 2008. Yet I would prefer one of Johnson’s portraits on my living room wall any day. When Lubaina Himid was anointed with the Turner in 2017, she was 63 – the oldest person and the first Black woman to win it. It was a momentous occasion, celebrated by many of us. Not only was it her personal win, but it also felt like a win for Black women, for women of colour, for older women and for all those older female artists who were still struggling and felt overlooked. Her eligibility was the result of a decision to drop the under-50 age restriction, one that perpetuated the myth that if an artist hadn’t broken on to the “main stage” by the age of 50 they were past it. Granta’s Best of Young British Novelists, which comes around every 10 years, works in the same way: only under-40s need apply. Such age restrictions imply that only younger people are capable of producing fresh and exciting work – they alone are the future. It is true that they have more birthdays ahead of them than their elders, but for every talent that diminishes with age there are many more producing their best work from a foundation of deep lived experience, a lifetime of skill development, a mature understanding of human complexity and an undaunted adventurous spirit. In short, ageing is not synonymous with decay, calcification and irrelevance. Some of the best debut Black female novelists who have emerged of late have been over 40 or even 50, such as Yvette Edwards, Sara Collins, Kit de Waal and Jacqueline Crooks, whose debut novel, Fire Rush, will be published next spring. Second-novel writers, after a long gap, include Jacqueline Roy and Nicola Williams, whose crime novel, The Advocate’s Devil, is also out in spring 2023. And let’s look no further than Chila Kumari Singh Burman’s takeover of the facade of Tate Britain during lockdown. Four decades into her career, she created a dazzling, unparalleled display of radical subversion, colour and energy. Prizes contribute towards a creative person’s success; some more than others. It goes without saying that there are many ways to define the concept of success. Creative ambition, originality and self-fulfilment are foremost, in my opinion, followed by external markers such as critical recognition, financial rewards, influence and audience. Himid, already a successful artist exhibiting globally, reached new heights after winning the Turner; a retrospective showcasing new and old work is on at that British temple of contemporary art, Tate Modern. Another landmark for a Black British female artist. The Turner is making up for lost time. Two more older Black women have been the beneficiaries of its largesse of late: Helen Cammock, who won it alongside three other winners in 2019, and Liz Johnson Artur, who was one of the recipients of a Turner bursary in 2020, awarded in place of the cancelled prize. As the first Black female recipient of the Booker prize – at the tender age of 60 – it has been career Christmas for me every day since. Winning it at 60 felt like the right time; interviewers are surprised when I don’t express regret at not breaking through earlier. Surely it would have been better for my career if I were younger? That is not how I see it. At my age, I have a body of work behind me, a deeply rooted work ethic, confidence in my creative practice and an ongoing ambition to expand my craft and keep growing. Winning the prize as a “senior” means I have avoided potential pitfalls. It has boosted my career, but I hope it hasn’t inflated my ego, or disengaged me from my community, or made me feel crushed by the weight of expectation. Sixty years of living without being well known is long enough to become rooted in yourself and to feel a deep sense of gratitude when good things happen. Himid, Johnson, Pollard and Boyce were key figures in the women-of-colour creative community in the 80s to which I belonged as a young theatre-maker and troublemaker. Himid curated three seminal Black women’s exhibitions during this period, a time when women of colour couldn’t get a look-in at the celebrated art galleries and museums, except maybe to don a catering uniform and dish up quiche lorraine or nut roast with a salad of rocket and pomegranate seeds. Pollard was the photographer and poster designer for Theatre of Black Women, the touring theatre company I co-founded in 1982 with Paulette Randall and Patricia St Hilaire. As I wrote in my memoir, Manifesto: On Never Giving Up, “the artistic community to which we belonged had women at the heart of it. The company was not a collective, but we were connected to a wider community, and so we did not feel isolated, and although we were marginalised as women of colour when we were in white feminist or predominantly male spaces, in our own company, we were at the centre of everything.” This was central to our survival and formed a solid foundation for our future careers. We were not alone. We did not have to explain to ourselves why we created art from our perspectives and we knew we had an audience for our work, no matter how small. Pollard was a supportive presence around our theatre company. Quiet, reliable, creative, she wore her hair in funky dreadlocks, as did many of us, but in rebellion against Babylon, rather than as a symbol of adherence to Rastafarianism. In the intervening decades, she never stopped pursuing her craft as a photographer, building up a steady portfolio of solo and group exhibitions, residences and teaching gigs, as well as awards, the most prestigious of which was the Baltic Artists award in 2019. In addition to all of these women totally smashing it, there are others of a similar vintage who came of age in the Black women’s artistic circles of the 80s. Adjoa Andoh, who plays the redoubtable Lady Danbury in Bridgerton – one of the most successful television series of recent years – began her career in a Black women’s play called Where Do I Go from Here?, which I saw at Drill Hall theatre in London in 1984. Having enjoyed an increasingly successful career since, including stints with the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, she is now a global phenomenon, not as an inexperienced ingenue plucked from obscurity and dazed by the attention, but as a seasoned thesp whose career has suddenly shot skywards. In short, she can handle it. Jackie Kay has long been a literary star, including five years as the Scottish makar, their poet laureate. We also need to pay attention to older visual artists who are not receiving enough exposure, such as Joy Gregory and Sutapa Biswas. Acclaim should not be contingent on winning big prizes or filling big galleries. A life in the arts means weathering the inevitable vicissitudes. There might be decades spent watching other creatives racing past you, making you feel left behind. For some, it might mean spending years, even decades, struggling to be creative when self-confidence is at a low, or struggling to find work or gain attention for it. The upside is that we become resilient through adversity and, if determined enough, unstoppable. It might mean developing a portfolio career where most of your income is derived from everything but your own creativity, as was the case with me. For others, there will be instantaneous success and the pressures that come with that when you are new to your professional practice. Until society becomes less negative towards ageing, especially of women, there will always be the fear that if you are not an instant success then you are destined for the slag heap. Once we hit 80, the myth is that we are supposed to be content with knitting blankets for grandchildren, or dribbling while free-farting in rocking chairs – insentient, incontinent, incoherent. Women are still unduly judged on our looks; the younger we appear, the more marketable we are. We are told to expect a loss in energy as we age, but, honest to God, I am the one bounding into the lecture room at 9am in the morning only to be greeted by sleepy-eyed 20-year-olds who can barely speak. And who are the people I see bestriding the parks, fields and hills on long walks, with energy to spare at the end? Just as women are taught to be ashamed of menstruation and the menopause, so we are taught to be ashamed of our maturation. How sad that 30-year-olds worry about being “past it”. We should celebrate every age and stage of our lives. It is one of my mantras, pounding the concept into my consciousness to redress a lifetime of being told otherwise. In the past few years, I have so frequently mentioned my age in interviews that it no longer holds any sway over me. I have talked the taboo out of myself. This year I will be 63. The fact that so many Black women are powering ahead and breaking through when they are older is testament to two things. The first is a lifelong commitment to creativity, to not giving up – and, even if we do, to picking ourselves up again. For some of us, this is yielding the external markers of success. The second is a societal shift where we are finally being seen – noticed, visible – and our work valued more than ever before beyond our own demographic. I asked Pollard how she felt about her nomination. Her reply was typically modest: “The nomination is a surprise and a vote of confidence, and a plus for photographic practice, which has been my medium for many years. I’ve always told students that they need to turn up for their practice every day. Nominations, awards and commissions are an element of being a visual artist, but after being around the art world for 40 years I have seen this interest come and go.” But I do think it will be different this time. We have made real progress, although we must never get complacent. We must each take responsibility for speaking out – for ourselves and future generations.",Arts/Books,‘They are totally smashing it!’ Bernardine Evaristo on the artistic triumph of older Black women,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/28/bernardine-evaristo-on-the-artistic-triumph-of-older-black-women
4/28/2022,"For the last few months, children such as myself have only had to turn on our TVs to see images of people stranded on their roofs hoping to be rescued by the State Emergency Service. Opening the Instagram app reveals how the Great Barrier Reef has just suffered its sixth mass coral bleaching. And “once in a hundred year” floods seem to happen just a bit too often. For some of us, it hits home on a personal level too. My home country and place of birth, India, is in a severe and brutal heatwave. It’s become ingrained into my morning routine to wake up and check the headlines: people struggling to breathe, wheat yields under pressure, deaths from heatstroke. Checking in with family and loved ones, praying that they’re OK. Pre-monsoon, the country is reporting temperatures of upwards of 45C day after day. This is unsurvivable as it stands, and given that much of India only experiences its hottest temperatures mid-May to June, it’s only set to get worse. This is what we see when we look at the present. It’s excruciatingly painful, then, to picture the future that we’re expected to build our lives in. What is the correct emotion to feel when we see this news? Is it gratitude for those of us who have not yet found ourselves in such life threatening situations, underscored by dread that soon we may be the people we have watched on TV with distress, being rescued? Is it survivor’s guilt, for this very reason? This rings true for me, having migrated to Australia at such a young age. While my family swelters through an unbearable heatwave, I’m left unscathed. Is it hope for the upcoming election, a chance that things might change, or anger that all we’ve seen thus far is both major parties frothing at the mouth at the supposed economic opportunity in backing fossil fuels, turning a blind eye to the humanitarian cost, as well as the many well-documented benefits of shifting to a clean economy? Anger that both major parties are taking emissions reductions targets to the election that are well below what leading scientists have indicated is needed to avoid climate catastrophe? Anger that some MPs feel the need to belittle those of us worried about our future, telling us to go back to school and become climate scientists or do something useful? I’m a year 12 student, runner, Lorde enthusiast, dog lover, climate activist. And, owing to the fact that I’m worried about climate change, I’m apparently also a victim of abuse. At least, this is the opinion of Liberal candidate for Macnamara, Colleen Harkin, when, on Sunday at the Macnamara candidates debate, I asked all candidates if they believed that the federal environment minister owed a duty of care to young people to protect us from climate change. A simple no would have sufficed. Instead, she said: “We all want a clean environment – we all want that. But to teach children that there is an emergency is nothing short of almost abuse … We have eight-year-old children who are stressed about the environment. We’ve taught them to be stressed.” To conflate the pressing issue of child abuse with the equally pressing issue of climate change and climate anxiety is to belittle both. On Tuesday, Harkin said in a written statement: “I accept my language was clumsy; the point I was seeking to make was that we should be teaching our children hope, not fear.” Nobody has abused or fear-mongered this into us. We’re children who have read the news, who have seen climate impacts devastate their families and friends. We’ve read the science. As Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change co chair Hans-Otto Pörtner put it, “any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.” That’s a future that we’ll be living in. Polls by the ABC’s Vote Compass and the Daily Aus showed that climate change is the most prevalent issue on the minds of voters. And yet, with 114 new fossil fuel projects in the pipeline, and a two-party system with deeply ingrained ties to big coal and gas, what our major parties are promising is the exact opposite. I’m a first-time voter. I’ll be voting for the climate, as will hundreds of thousands of young people like myself. The ball is in the court of both major parties. Show us you won’t be putting profit over people’s lives. We’re waiting.  Anjali Sharma was the lead litigant in Sharma v Environment Minister, the landmark court case against the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, which called for a duty of care to protect children against the impacts of climate change.
