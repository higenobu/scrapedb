3/17/2022,"A former Texas elections administrator from Smith County pleaded guilty to serving her employees colon cleanser disguised as an energy drink, KLTV reports. Denise Hernandez, 54, of Athens, pleaded guilty to two counts of assault causing bodily injury in the Smith County Court Of Law and received 18 months of deferred adjudication, which means her conviction will be kept off her criminal record. The guilty plea comes after Hernandez was arrested last June for spiking two workers’ energy drinks with colon cleanser without their knowledge or any regard for the staff’s “pre-existing medical conditions,” according to the arrest document reviewed by local outlet CBS 19. The employees had been working at the Smith County Courthouse in the elections department when they reportedly had a conversation with Hernandez, who left briefly before returning with a cup filled with a pink substance. Hernandez told the employees the liquid was Spark energy drink, only to reveal after consumption that it was in fact colon cleanser. According to the arrest affidavit, Hernandez began singing “you just drank colon cleanser” and making fun of the employees, one of whom was in serious pain. The employees wrote they initially hesitated to speak up because they were afraid of Hernandez, describing her as “a bully.” Hernandez handed in her resignation shortly after the incident on May 3, only to try and rescind it the following day. In a second letter sent to Smith County Judge Nathaniel Moran, Hernandez said she initially sought to quit her job due to a “childish incident,” but had realized she loved her job too much to quit. The Smith County Elections Commission voted to accept Hernandez’s original resignation.

3/17/2022,"Ukraine has identified four Russian generals it says have been killed since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his invasion of Ukraine three weeks ago, and NATO officials have confirmed three of those deaths and Putin, one of them. ""Western officials say that around 20 Russian generals were in Ukraine as part of the war effort, and that they may have pushed closer to the front to boost morale,"" which is sagging under the weight of heavy casualties, The New York Times reports. The slain generals were identified as Maj. Gen. Andrei Kolesnikov, Maj. Gen. Vitaly Gerasimov, Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, and on Wednesday, Maj. Gen. Oleg Mityaev. Some of those commanders were reportedly killed in combat, but ""two American military officials said that many Russian generals are talking on unsecured phones and radios,"" the Times reports, and ""in at least one instance, they said, the Ukrainians intercepted a general's call, geolocated it, and attacked his location, killing him and his staff."" Overall, at least 7,000 Russian troops have been killed and 14,000 to 21,000 injured, according to U.S. intelligence estimates.

3/17/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia on Tuesday quit the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights watchdog, pre-empting an expected expulsion over its attack on neighbour Ukraine. Russia is only the second country to leave the pan-European group tasked with upholding human rights and the rule of law since its formation after World War Two. Greece had done the same in 1969, also to avoid expulsion, after a group of army officers seized power in a military coup. It rejoined after restoring democracy five years later. Russia's withdrawal from the institution that devised the European Convention on Human Rights and helped eastern European nations to democratise their political systems after the collapse of Communism carries symbolic weight. But the decision, announced hours before a vote on its expulsion in the Council of Europe's assembly, also has concrete consequences. The human rights convention will cease to apply to Russia and Russians will no longer be able to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights against their government. Russia, explaining its departure, accused Western countries of undermining the human rights body, which had suspended Russia's membership on Feb. 25, the day after it invaded Ukraine. ""SLAM THE DOOR"" Leonid Slutsky, head of the International Affairs Committee of Russia's lower house of parliament, accused the countries of NATO and the European Union of seeing the Council of Europe as ""a means of ideological support for their military-political and economic expansion to the east"". In a resolution drafted on Monday but adopted on Tuesday after Moscow's announcement, the Council of Europe's assembly said Russia should be pushed out. ""In the common European home, there is no place for an aggressor,"" it said. The resolution, adopted by unanimity, said that the impact of Russia withdrawing from Europe's court of human rights would be mitigated by the fact that Moscow failed to properly act on its judgements. ""Today's decision is not against the people of Russia, it's against the autocratic, kleptocratic, oppressive regime of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,"" said former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, now a Council of Europe assembly member. ""My country, Greece, was kicked out of the Council of Europe in the 1970s ... this decision strengthened our struggle for democracy and freedom,"" he said. Pyotr Tolstoy, head of the Russian delegation at the Council's Parliamentary Assembly, said on his Telegram channel that he had handed over a letter from Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announcing Moscow's decision to leave the watchdog. The Council of Europe, which is separate from the European Union, confirmed it had received Moscow's letter. Russia describes its invasion of Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine and prevent a genocide of Russian speakers. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice. The Council of Europe was founded in 1949. Russia joined in 1996.

3/17/2022,"By Krisztina Than BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary will not send any weapons to Ukraine and will stay out of the war, Prime Minister Viktor Orban told a rally of his supporters on Tuesday, accusing the opposition of trying to drag Hungary into the conflict on its eastern border. The conservative nationalist leader has a tight race for election to a fourth consecutive term on April 3 because for the first time since 2010 his right-wing Fidesz party will face a united front of six opposition parties. Orban's path to re-election is complicated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has put his decade-long close relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a new light, drawing sharp criticism from the opposition. Addressing a rally of tens of thousands of supporters who waved the Hungarian national flag in front of parliament, Orban said Central Europe was only a ""chess board"" for big powers and if Hungary did not stand up for its interests, it could easily fall victim of the crisis. ""Russia looks at Russian interests, while Ukraine looks at Ukrainian interests. Neither the United States, nor Brussels would think with Hungarians' mind and feel with Hungarians' hearts. We must stand up for our own interests,"" Orban said. ""We must stay out of this war ... therefore we will not send any troops or weapons to the battlegrounds."" Orban said the choice for voters on April 3 will be between his party that wants peace and the leftist opposition ""which would stagger into a ruthless, protracted and bloody war."" The six-party opposition, led by Peter Marki-Zay, a small-town mayor and father of seven, has sharply criticised Orban's relations with Russia, saying Orban had built an illiberal state along Putin's model, with rampant corruption and curbs on media freedoms. The government denies the allegations. Speaking to an opposition rally by the Danube river, Marki-Zay, who has campaigned on a strongly pro-European platform, said Hungarians' choice has never been this easy in elections. ""We only have one choice: we must choose Europe instead of the east ... and freedom instead of authoritarianism,"" he said, with supporters chanting ""Europa, Europa."" Referring to European Union concerns about a decline in democratic standards in Hungary, Marki-Zay has said Orban's ""unlimited power has resulted in unlimited corruption"" while millions of Hungarians struggle to make ends meet. Fidesz slightly widened its lead in a late February opinion poll by Median to 39% compared with 32% for the opposition bloc. Orban has condemned the Russian invasion and has said Budapest would not veto EU sanctions agreed against Russia but that these must not affect Hungary's energy supplies.

3/17/2022,"The son of Vladimir Putin’s chief propagandist is among 370 more Russians who have been hit with sanctions, as the UK warned it would begin to target the children of Kremlin cronies. Nikolay Peskov, whose father Dmitry is Putin’s press spokesman, has had his assets frozen and can no longer travel to the UK. The 32-year-old who grew up in Britain and was educated here, moved back to Russia to serve in the army, and later worked for the Russian television channel RT. He joins a list of more than 1,000 individuals and businesses who are now the subject of financial and personal sanctions. Among the other Russian oligarchs targeted by the UK are Mikhail Fridman and German Khan, co-founders of the powerful Alfa-Group, and Pyotr Aven, the head of the Alfa Bank. Between them have a combined estimated worth of more than £100 billion. The UK has also taken action against a number of Putin’s political allies, including Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, and Dmitry Medvedev, the former president. Alongside Peskov, other propagandists to be targeted include Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign affairs spokesman, and the notorious internet ""troll farm"", the Internet Research Agency, which was said to have interfered in the US presidential election. Dmitry Peskov, who has long been accused of corruption, was hit by US sanctions last week and was added to the UK list as part of the latest crackdown aimed at tightening the screw on Moscow. His second wife, Tatiana Navka, the Olympic ice dancer, and his daughter, Elizaveta Peskova, who is a social media influencer, have also been hit by the latest round of sanctions and have had their assets frozen. Mr Peskov junior, who also uses his stepfather’s surname, Choles, was born in Moscow but moved to Britain with his mother in the 1990s. He was educated privately in the UK, but in 2010 was sentenced to 15 months in a young offender institution for assault after he was convicted of punching a teenager in the face during a mobile phone theft. In 2017, Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, drew attention to Nikolay’s lavish lifestyle in a blog entry that pointed to social media posts showing him posing with luxury yachts, private jets and expensive cars. At the time, Mr Navalny wrote: ""He doesn't work anywhere but is buying apartments, Range Rovers, Ferraris and he travels and spends whole days riding horses. We know what his profession is called: the son of a corrupt father."" Mr Navalny added: ""Nikolai Choles is an example of how in Russia where 20 million people live below the poverty line, where 70 per cent of the population dream of a monthly salary of 45,000 roubles (£587) one can live happily at the highest level and at the same time not have to do anything."" Nikolai’s half-sister, Elizaveta, has thousands of Instagram followers and uses the social media platform to boast about her lavish lifestyle. In 2019, it emerged that she was working as a trainee assistant to Aymeric Chauprade, a French MEP who used to be a member of the Front National, the far-Right group led by Marine Le Pen. The move to target the families of Russian oligarchs is part of a new push to bring pressure to bear on Moscow’s political and financial elite, according to a UK official. Asked about the strategy, the official said: ""Yes, there is actually quite a wide range, out of the 370, who are family members. ""We will be looking to sanction family members ourselves from now on as well, using these new powers (in the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act) to that effect. ""So there is a number of members, for example, of the big families like the Rotenberg family and a number of the Shuvalov family - (Igor) Shuvalov we sanctioned a couple of weeks ago. ""These kind of big oligarch families where the family members are also associated with the regime and very often benefiting from the regime, as well. So, yes, we are definitely including family members now."" Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, said: ""We are going further and faster than ever in hitting those closest to Putin – from major oligarchs, to his Prime Minister, and the propagandists who peddle his lies and disinformation. ""We are holding them to account for their complicity in Russia’s crimes in Ukraine. Working closely with our allies, we will keep increasing the pressure on Putin and cut off funding for the Russian war machine.""",World/The Telegraph,Son of Vladimir Putin’s press chief has assets frozen as 370 more Russians face sanctions,https://news.yahoo.com/son-vladimir-putins-press-chief-210417348.html
3/17/2022,"Valeria Shashenok, a Ukrainian photographer, is documenting her family's experience from inside a bomb shelter amid Russia's invasion of the country. Since the war, Shashenok has shared a series of videos on TikTok, which show how her family is coping while, she says, they are hunkered down in the shelter, which is located Chernihiv. In one clip, Shashenok — who goes by the username @valerissh and has garnered over 800,000 followers — chronicles how she cooks pasta.

Another clip shows Shashenok's mom preparing borscht — a sour soup common in Eastern Europe — on a small electric hot plate. TikTok In a video posted on March 11, Shashenok demonstrates how she and her family made coffee during a power outage at the shelter. With limited resources, Shashenok adds ground coffee beans and water to what, appears to be a heat-proof cup, before lighting the container with a blow torch, which instantly creates the coffee. ""I'm shocked, but it works!"" Shashenok wrote over the clip. TikTok Her account also chronicles the damage done to Ukraine. In a different video shared on March 4, Shashenok leaves the bunker to retrieve some items from her home, and while on the way, she shares footage of the country's destruction. Despite the heartache of war, Shashenok manages to incorporate humor in her TikTok videos, joking in one clip that the bomb shelter is like a ""5 star hotel"" and the bathroom area is a ""place for reading books!"" TikTok Speaking on her decision to document her experience, Shashenok told The Cut: ""I want to show what's happening in my country... I'm that person who always ragged on everything with humor. It's the best way to show people the problem. I'm that person who always sees light in the dark, and it's a nice way to do something for my country.""

Details of the fighting change by the day, but hundreds of civilians have already been reported dead or wounded, including children. More than a million Ukrainians have also fled, the United Nations says. The invasion, ordered by President Vladimir Putin, has drawn condemnation around the world and increasingly severe economic sanctions against Russia. With NATO forces massing in the region around Ukraine, various countries have also pledged aid or military support to the resistance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for peace talks — so far unsuccessful — while urging his country to fight back. Putin, 69, insists Ukraine has historic ties to Russia and he is acting in the best security interests of his country. Zelenskyy, 44, vowed not to bend. ""Nobody is going to break us, we're strong, we're Ukrainians,"" he told the European Union in a speech in the early days of the fighting, adding, ""Life will win over death. And light will win over darkness."" The Russian attack on Ukraine is an evolving story, with information changing quickly.
