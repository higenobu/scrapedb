2/9/2022,"Mikaela Shiffrin’s dream Olympics is fast turning into a nightmare.The 26-year-old overall World Cup leader was disqualified from her second race in three days on Wednesday morning after missing a gate early in the first run of the women’s slalom, her signature event, leaving her bid for potential record medal haul in tatters.Shiffrin, the seventh racer out of the starting gate, sat in the snow alongside the netting on the side of the course with her head bowed in disbelief for several minutes as her rivals continued their runs down the steep technical course known as the Ice River.  The shock result came two days after the American skied out during her first run of the giant slalom, ending her Olympic title defense only seconds into her Beijing debut. Shiffrin had failed to finish a race only twice in four years entering the Winter Games and 13 times in a total of 228 starts across all disciplines at World Cup, Olympic and world championship events.Shiffrin, whose three Olympic medals include gold in slalom in 2014 and in giant slalom in 2018, has said her plan is to race all five individual events in Beijing. Her next chance at becoming the first US alpine skier to win three Olympic golds will come Friday in the super-G.Once a teenage prodigy who became the youngest Olympic slalom champion in history at the Sochi Games, Shiffrin has since blossomed from a specialist into the world’s best all-around skier, branching out into the speed events with success and becoming the only skier, male or female, to win World Cup races in all six disciplines.Her 73 career wins on alpine skiing’s top circuit are third-most on the all-time leaderboard, trailing only Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark (86) and longtime US team-mate Lindsey Vonn (82). Shiffrin’s failure to finish either of her races so far is the latest sour note in what’s been a bleak Beijing Olympics for Team USA. The Americans’ longest-ever wait for their first gold at a Winter Games stretched to 31 events on Tuesday and several of their warmest medal contenders have finished off the podium entirely, among them defending Olympic champion Red Gerard (men’s snowboard slopestyle) and speed skaters Brittany Bowe (women’s 1500m) and Joey Mantia (men’s 1500m).",Sport/Sport,Mikaela Shiffrin’s Olympic dream turning into nightmare after slalom exit,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/08/mikaela-shiffrin-slalom-winter-olympics-beijing-2022
2/9/2022,"Australia’s Test captain, Pat Cummins, has broken his silence on Justin Langer’s resignation, defending his teammates against former players who have criticised the handling of the head coach’s departure. In a long statement issued before he is due to speak to media on Wednesday afternoon, Cummins thanked Langer for his “significant” legacies and said his often-cited “intensity drove a better team culture and higher team standards”.  “Justin has acknowledged that his style was intense. And it was,” Cummins said. “He has apologised to players and staff for his intensity. I think the apology was unnecessary. Because the players were OK with JL’s intensity. “It came from a good place – his fierce love of Australia and the baggy green – something which has served Australian cricket well for three decades. It’s what makes him a legend of the sport.” Cummins said Cricket Australia had made a “brave call” in only offering Langer a short-term contract but clarified the playing group would have accepted whatever decision the governing body made. He also directly addressed former players who have spoken out in support of their former Test teammate and friend. “Finally, we are custodians of cricket, with one very big thing in common: our first duty is to Australian cricket, which is bigger than any one of us,” he said. “I take this responsibility seriously. I live and breathe it. We also have a duty to our mates. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Many former players have reached out to me and silently offered me their advice which is welcome. Some others have spoken in the media – which is also welcome and comes from a love of the game and their support of a mate. “To all past players, I want to say this: Just as you have always stuck up for your mates, I’m sticking up for mine. I’m looking forward to speaking with the media today before training.” More to follow",Sport/Sport,‘Brave call’: Pat Cummins speaks out on Justin Langer’s resignation,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/09/brave-call-pat-cummins-makes-statement-on-justin-langers-resignation
2/9/2022,"Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyers once again called for the temporary sealing of legal arguments involving the juror who might not have disclosed childhood sexual abuse during jury selection. “With the constitutional right to a fair trial at stake, it is of paramount importance for the court to ensure the integrity of any fact-gathering process that may take place so that the inquiry is safeguarded and can uncover the truth of what happened,” her attorneys said in a letter Tuesday.  Maxwell was convicted on 29 July of sex trafficking and related counts for facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor girls, some as young as 14. Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking teen girls. He killed himself about one month later in a Manhattan jail while awaiting his trial. The new filing is among ongoing legal exchanges over the juror. Juror 50, whose name is Scotty David, sat for interviews where he publicly alleged that he was sexually abused as a child. David claimed that he told other jurors about this abuse – enabling them view things from a victim’s perspective. David’s comments about possible prior abuse prompted questions because then-prospective jurors completed questionnaires during the selection process – which asked about sexual abuse. David claimed that he did not recall the question about abuse but maintained he had answered every question honestly. After David’s interviews, prosecutors asked the judge, Alison Nathan, to investigate his statements; Maxwell’s legal team swiftly requested a hearing and new trial. Maxwell’s attorneys filed their detailed arguments for a new trial under a seal. They had also submitted their argument for sealing under wraps, but Nathan decided on 26 January that it must be posted openly to the docket. As such, Maxwell’s lawyers filed their argument for sealing publicly on 1 February, claiming that unsealing these detailed arguments before there is a decision about retrial “will provide a roadmap of the defense’s examination of Juror 50 and will allow him to plan out and tailor his responses, or even potentially spoliate evidence, to paint himself and his conduct in the best light possible”. They also said that Maxwell “seeks only a temporary sealing to protect the integrity of any fact-finding process ordered by the court”. Prosecutors said in 5 February court papers that these documents should be public, writing that “the defendant has not justified her sealing request”. The new filing from Maxwell’s lawyers relates to prosecutors’ response paperwork “in opposition to [her] Motion for a New Trial.” Maxwell’s attorneys also want Nathan to keep those documents temporarily under wraps. “The absence of this temporary safeguard will contribute to further obstruction of the truth-seeking process, compromising any factual inquiry ordered by the Court, and jeopardizing Ms. Maxwell’s legitimate opportunity to establish why a mistrial should be granted to vindicate her constitution right to a fair trial,” they said.",News/US news,Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyers renew call to seal juror’s legal arguments,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/08/ghislaine-maxwell-juror-scotty-david
2/9/2022,"Lithium prices have “gone ballistic” as surging electric vehicles sales worldwide create massive demand for the critical component of lithium-ion batteries. According to figures from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI), the price of the lithium-rich raw material spodumene rose 478.3% between January 2021 and January 2022.  In January alone the price of spodumene jumped 45.5% to US$2,400 a tonne, up from $1,650 in December. Similar price rises were recorded for lithium carbonate and hydroxide – refined lithium at different stages of purity – over the past year. BMI is forecasting the price will continue to increase for at least the next six month off the back of massive demand for battery cells. In January the consulting firm McKinsey predicted the market for lithium batteries would grow to at least $360bn by 2030, with growth averaging 20% a year until the end of the decade. But some analysts have sounded a note of caution as lithium pricing can be volatile – demand can grow quickly but new mines open and increase supply, dropping the price again. Tim Buckley, an energy transition analyst and director of Clean Energy Finance, says demand for lithium is likely to remain high. “It’s unsustainably high – it’s gone ballistic. It’s just brilliant to watch – the world’s transforming before our eyes,” Buckley said. “Nothing excites financial markets more than a 500% increase in prices.” Buckley, an early investor in lithium, said while a range of factors were at play in creating the situation – including a labour shortage at key mine sites in Western Australia as a result of the pandemic and supply chain issues – it was surging demand for EVs in China that was the main driver. He said this marked a “structural change” in the global economy and any future price correction would not be as severe as “cyclical” corrections in the past. After slowing at the outset of the pandemic, electric vehicles sales have come roaring back in European and Chinese markets. Although growth in the US has been slow, China alone recorded a 154% increase in the number of electric cars sold in 2021, with 3.3m in total. China is also responsible for processing most of the world’s lithium, meaning a fall in prices may come as geopolitical tensions push countries to look for alternative supplies. But Buckley said it will take time for these new sources to come online, while the global push to “electrify everything” and reach net zero by 2050 meant demand would stay high. He said the situation represents an opportunity for Australia, whose key exports – iron, coking coal, liquefied natural gas and thermal coal – are heavily exposed to decarbonisation efforts. In a sign of where things are going, French steel giant ArcelorMittal and German steel company Salzgitter AG in the last fortnight separately announced billions of dollars in new investment in electrifying their operations Australia stands to gain by supplying lithium for the production of electric vehicles, although it faces competition from the “lithium triangle” of Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. Processing this material to varying degrees of purity close to its source may offer a chance for Australia to edge out its competitors, with some companies already heading in that direction In 2019 Wesfarmers sold its three coal mines and sunk new investment into the Mt Holland lithium mine and Kwinana refinery in WA. There was a setback for Rio Tinto when the Serbian government revoked its licence to develop the Jadar lithium mine after protests and a diplomatic stoush with the Australian government. But Buckley said the trend – and the opportunity – is clear. “The value of lithium companies listed on the ASX is multiples of the coal sector. If we can be not just a quarry to China, Japan and Korea, and do value-adding, that is a huge structural shift,” Buckley said. “If you just leave Gina and Twiggy to dig up the minerals without value adding, Australia is going to be worse off.”",News/Australia news,‘Gone ballistic’: lithium price rockets nearly 500% in a year amid electric vehicle rush,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/gone-ballistic-lithium-price-rockets-nearly-500-in-a-year-amid-electric-vehicle-rush
