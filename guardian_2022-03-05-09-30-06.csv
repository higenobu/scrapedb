3/5/2022,"On the day the war began, I was in Kyiv with my family. I have been injured recently, so could not train with the team. At 5am my young son awoke, and my wife got up to calm him. Then we heard the explosions, one after the other. We thought there had been an accident, but then we read online that the war had begun. We quickly began to gather our belongings. I am Georgian, and was in Georgia in 2008 when Russia attacked our country, so this is not the first time I’ve been through a war. I told my wife: “Let’s get ready more quickly.” I drove the car closer to our house, loaded it with things and then waited for a couple of my teammates. They are foreigners and also have young families. We drove away from Kyiv together. The cities of Zhytomyr and Bila Tserkva, which are being bombed, are not far away. Another nearby city, Vasylkiv, was bombed non-stop for three or four days. Only the sounds of the explosions reach us, lighting up the sky at night. We have gone to a village a safe distance away, and at the moment we are calm. On the way, we stopped at the shops. There are children with us who need artificial nutrition. In the village there is only one open store: the adults buy food, while parents have stocked up on enough mixtures for the kids. Almost all of the Kolos players are gathered here now. Everyone wanted to stay, but every day one or two people have left. Those who remain have nowhere to go; if they were to go anywhere then it would only be to places where the Russians shoot and bomb. It is hard to leave the country: there are checkpoints on the highways and queues everywhere. If you do not manage to reach a town where it is safe to spend the night then it will be dangerous to go out after 5pm because we have a curfew under martial law. If you look suspicious, you could be shot. They are trying to purge Russian saboteurs from our cities, so we are advised not to move around. We are far from the border and cannot take risks: my wife is pregnant and many of the others have small children. I am still here and those who are with me will also stay. We hope everything will calm down and be all right. We are all sticking together: the players, our families and other people who accompanied us. We sit together in the bunker, we eat together, we spend the difficult moments together. As long as there are no problems with food or water, we must not complain. There are others in worse situations: in Chernihiv, my parents and my in-laws are constantly being threatened by shells. The help we are getting comes from the president of Kolos and other club employees. They call, give us information, make sure we can eat and drink. We try to get food from the store ourselves but most of our assistance comes from the club president. He is close to us, and we to him; he is worried and has not gone anywhere. We know he is with us. This has been the worst of weeks. My country and loved ones are in great danger. I am safe, but I cannot say that for all of my relatives and friends, and it worries me sick. My grandmother is sitting in an apartment in Kyiv; she cannot go out to buy groceries because it may be her last walk. One close friend has joined the army; another somehow managed to leave Kharkiv and told me that there were tank battles near his house. A former academy teammate of mine who lives in Vinnytsia told me that, near his house, they caught a group of Russian saboteurs who had put marks down for the Russian army and air force – showing them where to land and where to drop bombs. It is the worst possible nightmare. At Veres, some of the players are trying to help people by delivering food and water. Others tried to get jobs in the territorial defence force but were not taken because there was no space left. Then there are those who shelter in basements with their wives and children, hiding from the bombs and the invaders. It is scary. The club cannot give us much help at the moment. The management asked us to understand that this is such a hard time and they cannot do anything. Some of the players are running out of money and have very little left. This is all happening to us in real life, but our people are very united and everyone helps each other as best they can. I’m still in Ukraine with my family: I can’t say exactly where, but fortunately we are safe. We are all worried, and waiting to see how things develop. We hope there will be peace. This is our country and we have nowhere else to go. We hope until the last. Women and children are able to go abroad, but men are not allowed to depart. When the war began, we all received a call from the club and were told that everyone should go home for an indefinite period. We had felt tension over the previous month. People were constantly talking, warning that something bad could happen in the country, but they did not think until the very last that such a thing could happen. The evening before it started, we all smiled and did not really believe it, but we folded our clothes so that we could be ready to leave straightaway. We woke at about 7am to calls from our loved ones, saying that cities and military bases were being bombed. The morning began in a panic. We packed up and left to be with our families, so that we could make further decisions. We have food, so there is no big problem with provisions. Everyone from our club went straight to their families, rather than going to fight. Let’s be honest: how can we help in that way if we don’t have any expertise, or own anything? We can assist in a different way: we help the army, we go to the soldiers with food. Periodically, people from the club call and ask if we are fine, but nobody really knows what to do. Everyone is waiting for the situation to be resolved. Nobody can make plans about football; we just want to hear that peace has come. Many peaceful people are dying, and that is the most awful thing. The loss of lives is the most terrible disaster. I am in Antalya, Turkey, with my teammates and we have nowhere to go. We arrived here on 11 February for a training camp before the season was due to restart and we were only supposed to be here for a couple of weeks. It is impossible to return to Ukraine, so we have to stay here and hope for the best. I know of four other clubs from our country that are in the area too. There is still training every day, but the coach has been very clear that anyone who does not feel up to taking part should sit it out. On some days I do not feel like going anywhere near the pitch. My mind is not here: it is with my parents and brother in my home city, Kharkiv. There are attacks happening there every day. My family are just trying to survive, hiding in a basement. We are in contact constantly. As I speak, I am looking for ways to get them out as quickly and safely as possible. I have an apartment in Kharkiv and on Wednesday it was shelled. Some people lost their homes altogether and windows were smashed all over the building. It feels terrible to be so far away. We heard that a youth team player from our club, Vitalii Sapylo, died in battle and felt distraught. Our country is united against Vladimir Putin and fighting for the freedom and independence of Ukraine. Meanwhile, as footballers we worry about losing our jobs. We do not yet know whether our club can continue paying us. There is no hope of finding a club in Turkey, and it is hard to focus in any case. Somehow we will have to find a way to make money for our families, who need it so much. This tragedy must stop now and the whole world must know exactly what is happening. Ukraine is my second home: I came here from Croatia in 2006 at the age of 19, married a Ukrainian, had a daughter here and have lived happily in Dnipro. I love this country so much. What we are experiencing now is like some kind of terrible dream. At 2am last Thursday morning our squad arrived at a hotel in Kyiv: we had been at a training camp and flew there because we were supposed to be playing Dinamo Kyiv. At 4am we heard of the first bombings and were shocked. No one believed Putin would do this at night, while people were sleeping. Most of us left on the club bus, driving to our training base near Dnipro. Some of the guys stayed in Kyiv, or went elsewhere to their families, and the foreign players managed to leave the country. I went to our camp and then back to the family home. My wife had sent me details about bombings at Dnipro airport and a military base, not far from where we live. It was crazy, indescribable. Since then, we have been lucky. Initially there was panic in the city: people buying all the petrol, pharmacy products and other goods they could. But in the last few days things have been OK, and we have all we need for now. Sometimes there are sirens, but nothing ends up happening. People worry when it happens, but it makes them ready to mobilise and fight for their country. I keep in touch with our players and other coaches every day, and with colleagues all across Ukraine. We are not concerned about football or training: we want to stop the war before coming back to the game we love. Nobody at the club has joined the army yet but you never know what will happen in the future. Perhaps if we are needed, we will go. I think our club will be OK: it’s a young, ambitious club and the president is committed to supporting us. But many clubs in Ukraine could go bankrupt or fold after this war. Football will be far down the list of priorities as the country rebuilds. This is the third war of my life; I am still only 35. I was five when the Yugoslavian war began, and still feel the impact on my family. I was here in Ukraine when war began in the Donbas in 2014. Now we are going through this. When I think about it too much, I just don’t know what to say.",Sport/Football,‘The worst possible nightmare’: voices from Ukrainian football as war rages,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/05/ukrainian-football-voices-russia-invasion-war-worst-nightmare
3/5/2022,"The rise of Taskmaster has been an astonishing thing to witness. From its humble beginnings at the Edinburgh festival, to its television debut on the relatively lowly wilds of Dave, the show has a habit of winning audiences through word of mouth alone. Since Channel 4 acquired the series two years ago, Taskmaster’s mix of inventive games and comedian contestants who can flick from jolly to competitive in the blink of an eye has seen it edge closer and closer to national treasure status – a fact reflected in its recent British Comedy award win for best comedy entertainment show. The award, in fact, almost threatens to derail our interview before it even begins. I’m due to talk to the show’s creator, Alex Horne, and its executive producer, Jon Thoday, the morning after their win, but word comes through that I have to call them as late as I possibly can, because they’ve spent the previous night celebrating in the pub. “It was a very nice night,” recalls Horne hesitantly when we do finally speak. And his head today? “Well, I’m currently in a field with a dog,” he offers unconvincingly. We have convened to discuss the latest step in Taskmaster’s ongoing global domination. Not content with becoming a genuinely beloved institution that – thanks to All 4’s censored version – the whole family can watch together, Taskmaster has taken the unprecedented step of becoming its own streaming platform. Taskmaster Supermax+, a worldwide subscription-based streaming service, has just launched. For £5.99 a month, subscribers will get every episode of Taskmaster ever made, ad free. And while that might not sound like that great a deal for British viewers, who can already watch every episode of Taskmaster for free on All 4 (and will continue to get new episodes on Channel 4), for fans worldwide who struggle to see full shows, it might just be a godsend. So how did it come about? “I don’t think I necessarily know the answer,” struggles Horne. “Except that it’s just something we’ve talked about for a long time as a sort of exciting experiment and no one else seemed to do it.” He pauses, floundering. “Should I answer the question, Alex?” asks Thoday, calmly. “Yeah, that’s a good idea, John,” agrees Horne. Thoday explains that, for a long time, Taskmaster has wobbled on the brink of breaking America. “We tried a couple of times to launch the show in the US,” he says. “We tried doing a US version on Comedy Central, and to be frank it didn’t really work. And we’d also licensed the show to one of the networks, but they pulled it after one night.” Despite all this apparent failure, though, there was one sign that Americans were starting to fall in love with Taskmaster. “I just noticed by looking at our YouTube numbers that more and more Americans were watching the actual classic UK show online,” Thoday says. “So maybe trying to do a new version isn’t the right thing to do. “We should just try and build the British version up in the US. So we decided to have a go, launch our own SVOD [subscription video on demand], largely to make it available to places in the world where anybody can get it if they want it.” “That’s a much better answer than mine, John,” says Horne. “I learned a lot there.” The pair claim this is the first time a TV show has effectively taken the step of becoming its own Netflix, which is a huge gamble. Is it likely to work? “We have absolutely no idea,” replies Thoday. “We don’t really mind, either,” adds Horne. “It’s sort of just an experiment. We’re not taking it off YouTube or anything like that. This will sit alongside it. But I also like the idea that everything is in one place and we can do what we want with it. So we can put episodes up from other countries, and we can do some extra bits just for this. But we do like the idea of having the complete collection in one place, I suppose, because we’ve built up a weird little world.” It seems like a nice, if somewhat niche, way of keeping control of the show. As Thoday has already explained, the 2018 American remake wasn’t much of a success, despite boasting talents like Reggie Watts, Kate Berlant and Ron Funches, and despite shipping Horne over to replicate his British role. In hindsight, the pair put this misstep down to an overwillingness to make creative compromises. “First of all, it had nothing to do with the American comedians,” explains Horne. “But, for instance, we were told that we had to make it half the length.” Thoday points out that the other international versions, which have basically mimicked the formula to the letter, have had much more success. In Sweden, Horne giddily reveals, the show has become such a runaway hit that an opposing channel had to relent and move its version of Strictly Come Dancing to another slot. Among some Taskmaster fans there is a small but important concern. The show depends, more than anything else, on two things. First, this is a series that blasts through 10 high-profile comedians a year, and there have been some jitters about how deep the well is. Second, almost every task on the show comes from the mind of Alex Horne. So far, he has been breathtakingly inexhaustible in coming up with ideas that walk the line between simple and fantastical, but no man is a machine. What if, one day, this well runs dry too? The success of the international Taskmasters should go some way to assuaging both these fears. I ask Horne if, thanks to all the remakes, he has effectively been granted a pipeline of new ideas. “It’s a very funny process,” he replies. “I’ve got a version of me in Sweden called David Sundin, and the version of me in New Zealand is called Paul Williams. We’ve got quite similar brains and we do share ideas. And if they’ve got a task that they’re really excited about, they will tell me first. Not because they have to, but because it’s sort of our hobby. It’s a weird little pool of taskmakers. There are probably only about five of us across the world, but it’s quite a nice resource.” As for the contestants, there are still plenty of options left. Horne says he’s considering bringing in some comedians from the international versions, which seems sensible given that someone like Berlant has the potential to burn the whole place down. The annual New Year Treat specials have also proved that, if chosen judiciously, non-comedians can make perfectly entertaining contestants. Plus, it seems as if Horne had secretly treated the previous night as something of a reconnaissance mission. “It was funny looking around the room yesterday at the comedy awards,” he says. “Tom Allen mentioned the fact that, amazingly, he’s not been involved yet. And when Meera Syal got up to present an award, I said, ‘Why have we not asked her?’ So there are many more.” And then, on top of all this, we have a new British series on the horizon. Starting at some point next month, Taskmaster’s 13 series will bring together Ardal O’Hanlon, Bridget Christie, Chris Ramsay, Judi Love and Sophie Duker. It’s an exciting lineup, and one that Horne thinks is very well balanced. “They’re all very different, but they feel very different to the previous series as well. As long as they’re coming from slightly different angles. Sometimes it’s nice if two of them are friends, and sometimes it’s nice if they’ve never met before. A lot of the show is done on instinct, the ‘feeling right’, I suppose.” The world arguably needs some of Taskmaster’s escapist whimsy more than ever right now. As we wrap up, I ask Horne if there are any big standout moments from series 13 that we should be looking out for. “People get so cross with me when I say things,” he sighs. “Definitely I don’t want to highlight one comedian in particular, but I would say Judi Love. Ed Gamble is the host of our Taskmaster podcast, and he’s watched all the new episodes, and he just texted me the words ‘Judi Love’ and I knew exactly what he meant. So she’s phenomenal. And I think that’s all I need to say. Judi Love will steal quite a few of the episodes.”",Arts/Television & radio,‘We’ve no idea if it will work’: Taskmaster launches own streaming service,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/05/taskmaster-launches-own-streaming-service-supermax
3/5/2022,"The founder of Binance, the cryptocurrency trading platform, has dismissed fears that virtual money could be used by the Kremlin to evade sanctions as he claimed that “crypto is too small for Russia”. Changpeng Zhao said cryptocurrencies also defeated attempts to work around sanctions by being too traceable, adding that more focus should be placed on banks. In a statement Zhao said the media and politicians should be focusing on conventional lenders and the oil and gas market. “Currently, the media and politicians are spending a lot of effort and focus on crypto and sanctions,” he said. “The truth is, crypto is too small for Russia. If we look at the crypto adoption today, there is probably about 3% of the global population with some kind of crypto exposure (ie, owning some crypto). Of those, most only have a small percentage of their net worth in crypto. Less than 10% on average. So, there is probably only less than 0.3% of the global net worth in crypto today. This percentage applies equally to Russia.” The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the US is considering imposing sanctions on Russia’s cryptocurrency market, amid concerns that currencies like bitcoin offer an alternative way, outside the international banking system, to make irreversible cross-border transactions. Zhao denied this applied to Binance, saying it “applies the same sanctions rules as the banks, according to international standards”. Zhao said the use of blockchain in cryptocurrency transactions meant that crypto assets are “not an effective tool for illicit activities”. A blockchain is a digital, decentralised ledger maintained by a network of computers that registers every crypto transaction and can be scrutinised by anyone. Zhao added that using privacy-focused digital currencies such as Monero would not work either because the market capitalisation of Monero is $3bn compared with Russia’s GDP – a measure of economic output – of $1.5tn. “Another reason Russia would not want to use crypto is that it is too traceable. And governments around the world are already very adept at tracking it,” said Zhao. Zhao, whose personal wealth has been estimated at $1.9bn (£1bn) by Forbes magazine’s billionaires list, said this week Binance had donated $10m to aid the humanitarian effort in Ukraine and help those fleeing the conflict.",News/Technology,Binance founder says cryptocurrencies won’t help Russia evade sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/04/binance-founder-says-cryptocurrencies-wont-help-russia-evade-sanctions
3/5/2022,"The death of Shane Keith Warne – leg-spinner and larrikin, legend and lair – at the age of just 52 has left a nation in mourning. Australians woke to the scarcely believable news that the cricketer, a man who had, for many, come to embody the rarely realised national ideal of the irreverent, unafraid maverick, had died of a suspected heart attack. The tributes were led by teammates and friends, along with those he tormented with his vast, dazzling array of legbreaks, zooters, flippers and the occasional straight one. But the repercussions of the end of his vast, short life were felt far beyond the cricketing world. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australians had woken “in shock and sadness to the awful news” of Warne’s death, describing him as “one of our greatest cricketers of all time, one of only a few that could approach the extraordinary achievements of the great Don Bradman”. “His achievements were the product of his talent, discipline and passion for the game he loved. “But Shane was more than this to Australians. He was one of our nation’s greatest characters. His humour, his passion, his irreverence, his approachability ensured he was loved by all. “There was none like Shane.” The premier of Warne’s home state of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, said he “didn’t just inspire a cricketing generation – he defined it”. Andrews has offered Warne’s family a state funeral for the cricketer. “We are all numbed by the news,” Australian captain Pat Cummins said from Pakistan. “Shane was a once-in-a-century cricketer and his achievements will stand for all time, but apart from the wickets he took and the games he helped Australia win, what he did was draw so many people to the sport. “The game of cricket was never the same after Shane emerged, and it will never be the same now he has gone. Rest in peace, King.” Warne was never the cricketing establishment’s favourite son, his extraordinary career contained far too many indiscretions, public and private, for that. “The greatest captain Australia never had” was a sobriquet regularly thrown his way, half-praise, half-condemnation. But he was a hero, always, to those in the outer. Online, Warne was described as a man “as real as they come”. Shocked waking up to this news, the same as all Aussies today.Legend is thrown around liberally, but it is a term that perfectly describes Shane Warne.He was not perfect, but that is why we loved him, as real as they come, said it as he saw it.Vale Warney pic.twitter.com/kTSCLJR6L3 Andy Fisher, from Melbourne, wrote to the Guardian of the almost spiritual quality of watching Warne bowl at his home grown, Australia’s sporting citadel, the MCG. Warne’s premature death, he said, was “a gut punch, a hole torn into Australia’s cultural fabric”. “Watching him bowl at the MCG was the pinnacle of sporting experience for me and many Victorians – the larrikin hometown hero who had remade cricket single-handedly. The crackling hush descending as he stood at the top of his run, a glint in his eye, rolled the ball deftly again and again off the side of his wrist, a cobra mesmerising its prey. “The theatre. The electricity. The ebb and flow of duels with the likes of Lara, Tendulkar, Flintoff. The way he held 90,000 people’s hopes and dreams in his palm ... and then the roar of release. Off-field he was always larger than life, in turns hapless or hilarious, getting into scrapes and never not chugging fully from the cup of life. “RIP Warnie – you will always be Melbourne’s favourite son.” Warne’s statistics – 708 Test wickets from 145 Test matches, 17 man-of-the-match awards, one of Wisden’s five cricketers of the 20th century (the only one without a knighthood) – were formidable, but told only a fraction of the player’s influence in reshaping attitudes to cricket, and to its most arcane practice, spin bowling, in particular. His legacy can be counted too in the number of leg-break bowlers, a once-dying art, plying their craft on grounds all over the country, all over the world. From Victoria, Charles Bickford wrote that “watching my son get gripped by cricket and particularly leg spin has been a beautiful, bright spot this dark summer. “He’s shown a natural aptitude for it, and a strong work ethic. We’ve been in the nets most mornings before school this summer – weather permitting. It’s been a time travelling experience into the world of young men for me – as the summer progressed we were joined by various local kids and their talk of players past and present, ball types and arguments over 6s and catches. The mind games of Shane Warne.” Bickford’s son has been invited to trial for the Victorian under-12 team. The letter has been framed. But there is a pall over cricket now.“I was awoken by the rain just now at 3:30am in Melbourne … five hours before this week’s match is due to start – the absurdly large club kit bag in the car outside. This time the rain carries the message that the game, the last of this season will be cancelled – and it is almost a relief as I don’t think we could possibly know what to do on the field with this awful, awful news.” Warne transcended sport. Another Gladiator, Russell Crowe, described him as a loyal friend. Sir Elton John, a longtime friend, said “Shane was a magical bowler and such huge fun”. British singer Ed Sheeran said Warne had the “kindest heart”. “Such a gentleman. He gave so many hours and years of his life to bring joy to others, and was such an amazing friend to me. I’ll bloody miss you mate.” Another proud Melburnian, Kylie Minogue, paid tribute. The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, paid her respects to Warne and former Australian wicketkeeper Rod Marsh, who died a day earlier, saying both were “two legends of cricket and sport … taken too soon”. The British prime minister led tributes of overseas leaders.

3/5/2022,"The kidnapping of Sherri Papini, who disappeared during a jog in the northern California woods and, by her own account, was abducted, chained to a pole for three weeks, half-starved, beaten, branded and then released, was a fabrication, federal authorities said. According to the FBI, whose long investigation culminated in Papini’s arrest on Thursday, she spent the 22 days of her supposed captivity at an ex-boyfriend’s house in southern California and either inflicted the injuries on herself or got the ex-boyfriend to do it for her, according to the FBI. A statement from Papini’s family expressed dismay that she was arrested in front of her two children but did not directly challenge the FBI’s findings, saying: “We are confused by several aspects of the charges and hope to get clarification in the coming days.” News of Papini’s arrest stunned the small town of Redding where, in late 2016, friends and neighbors responded to news of her abduction by raising money to help her family. One friend, working with an anonymous donor and a government security consultant, even concocted an elaborate scheme to offer $100,000 or more for Papini’s release – a sum they called a “reverse ransom” because her captors never asked for money, or anything else. The news appears to have come as less of a surprise to the Shasta county sheriff’s department, which came under heavy criticism at the time for casting doubt on the abduction story and for worrying that the “reverse ransom” offer was an open invitation to scam artists. Papini was initially listed as a “voluntary missing adult” before the California department of justice, under heavy public pressure, changed the designation to “disappearance under suspicious circumstances”. The sheriff’s department did not comment on the FBI’s findings and investigation. Papini herself is being charged with lying to the FBI and with mail fraud – because, according to the government’s court filings, some of the money she received came in the mail. And, while the couple raised more than $30,000 through a GoFundMe drive – money that the FBI says they used to pay off credit card debt, among other things – the authorities have said they have no plans to charge the husband, Keith Papini, with a crime. It’s unclear why Papini apparently staged her own kidnapping, but in a 55-page criminal complaint, the FBI quotes several people close to Papini saying that she has a history of telling lies to draw attention to herself. An ex-husband told investigators she had “fabricated stories about being the victim of abuse” both during and after their marriage. Papini initially said her captors were two Latina women – an accusation that coincided with Donald Trump’s election as president and a flurry of hostile political rhetoric directed at individuals from Mexico and Central America. The criminal complaint, by contrast, describes how Papini and her ex-boyfriend used prepaid “burner” phones to communicate for several months before he drove to Redding to pick her up on the day of the supposed abduction. She left behind some strands of hair, and her cellphone – which her husband later thought had been “placed” in a way he found weird. Then, for the next three weeks, she hid out at her ex-boyfriend’s apartment, deliberately eating less than usual, chopping off her hair and harming herself. At one point, Papini sent her ex-boyfriend to a hardware store to buy a wood burning tool which he used to brand her shoulder, the complaint said. Early in the investigation, the FBI found male DNA on Papini’s clothes that did not match her husband’s. But they had to wait until 2020 before receiving permission to test the ex-boyfriend’s own DNA, eventually recovering some from a bottle of green tea they recovered from his trash. It matched. It was the ex-boyfriend – not named in the complaint – who told the authorities about the allegedly staged abduction, and the FBI later corroborated most of his story through phone records and car rental records. They also talked to two of his cousins who saw Papini at his apartment during her “captivity”. One of the many outstanding questions in the case is whether local law enforcement in Redding is still investigating other aspects of the story. The Shasta county sheriff’s department did not respond when asked, and the friend who set up the “reverse ransom” scheme did not respond to an interview request.",News/US news,"California jogger Sherri Papini staged own violent kidnapping, FBI says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/california-kidnapping-sherri-papini
3/5/2022,"Viktor Hovland, watching on television with feet up, was at least served a reminder of the grisly nature of Bay Hill’s closing stretch as shadows lengthen. A year ago, Hovland tied third at the Arnold Palmer Invitational after 36 holes. By Sunday night, he shared 49th. Rory McIlroy had clung on manfully to a nine-under-par aggregate, matching Hovland, before a missed putt from under 3ft at the 15th. Then McIlroy’s iron into the par-three 17th bounded into thick rough behind the green, that preceded another bogey. McIlroy’s 72 was far from disastrous in the context of firm, crusty putting surfaces but he had slipped from a share of the lead to tying second with Tyrrell Hatton and Talor Gooch. Billy Horschel, who is six under, lurks with typically menacing intent. “It gets really difficult out there,” said McIlroy. “I’m glad I saw the course in this condition because that should help me over the weekend.” Hovland’s morning 66 was remarkable for the inclusion of just 23 putts. The jaunty Norwegian is seeking a fifth victory since November; that should be good enough to propel him to No 2 in the world. “I try to forget the weekend here last year,” Hovland said. “I played really well the first few days, very similar to how I have played so far this year. The course just gets harder and harder every single day, and it started blowing. I made a few too many bad swings, ended up in bad spots and just didn’t really take my medicine.” Hatton won here in 2020, in what was the last full event before the PGA Tour endured a pandemic-enforced shutdown. Hatton’s prominence – he added a 68 to Thursday’s 69 – would therefore be notable but for the Englishman’s grim prognosis of the state of his game. “I’m not particularly happy with how I have hit the golf ball over the last few days,” Hatton said. “I think the score is pretty flattering. I’ve putted really well, which is why I’ve got the score that I have, but I know that I can’t keep hitting it that badly, certainly given it’s going to be playing much tougher this weekend. I’m pretty happy with the position I’m in going into the weekend. I’m just hoping that I can play a lot better.” Those to depart at the halfway point included Patrick Reed, Henrik Stenson and Justin Rose. Ian Poulter did survive for the weekend but will be hugely frustrated that he played his second nine in four-over-par 40. Until then, the Englishman had been firmly in contention at minus five. As the second round in Orlando rumbled towards its conclusion, it was confirmed Phil Mickelson will be a notable absentee from next week’s Players Championship. Mickelson is taking a break from the game after being embroiled in a scandal relating to comments made about a Saudi Arabian-backed breakaway league. Mickelson has missed the PGA Tour’s marquee event just two other times since 1992; once because of a broken leg and once due to the birth of his daughter.",Sport/Sport,Viktor Hovland overtakes Rory McIlroy to take halfway lead at Bay Hill,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/04/viktor-hovland-overtakes-mcilroy-to-take-halfway-lead-at-bay-hill
