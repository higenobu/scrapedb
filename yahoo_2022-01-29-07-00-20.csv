1/29/2022,"Stocks surged into the close reversing earlier losses on Friday as investors took in earnings results from some major tech companies and another hot print on inflation at the end of another volatile week.  The S&P 500 closed up 2.4%, posting a weekly advance and ending a three-week losing streak. While the Dow ended up 1.65% and Nasdaq gained 3%.  Technology stocks led the way higher as Apple (AAPL) jumped after the iPhone-maker reported record quarterly sales and better-than-expected profits despite supply chain challenges. Meanwhile, Robinhood (HOOD) shares shook off overnight losses to trade higher after the trading platform missed on quarterly revenue, posted a larger-than-expected quarterly decline in users, and offered disappointing guidance.  Fresh economic data was also in focus on Friday. The latest inflation data showed another multi-decade high rate of price increases, as the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index posted a 5.8% year-over-year rise in December, or the biggest jump since 1982. Core PCE, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices, rose at a 4.9% annual rate, representing the largest leap since 1983.  The S&P 500 was on track to post a weekly loss of about 1.3%, based on Thursday's closing prices. New reports showing a better-than-expected rise in fourth-quarter U.S. GDP and improvement in weekly jobless claims did little to help turn stocks around on Thursday. The Dow and Nasdaq have each also fallen over the course of the past week, with volatility rising as traders considered the implications of the Federal Reserve's more hawkish monetary policy tilt for markets.  ""The markets digested this hawkish Fed pivot that I think surprised people in terms of its magnitude,"" Scott Crowe, CenterSquare Investment Management chief investment strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday. ""It wasn't so long ago that they were describing inflation as 'transitory,' but now they have their sights firmly set on moderating inflation. And I think that's given the market a lot of indigestion as it starts to digest that pretty dramatic shift."" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell strongly signaled earlier this week that a March liftoff on interest rates to above their present near-zero levels was in the cards. However, other questions remained — namely around just how quickly the Fed will raise interest rates, and around when and how rapidly the Fed will begin drawing down its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet and tightening financial conditions.  ""Everything the Fed is doing at this point we think has just been priced in over the last few weeks. And that's where a lot of the slide in the market has come from,"" Morgan Stanley Managing Director Kathy Entwistle told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday. ""And the big question is, will we slide a little bit more? What's happening?"" ""We're looking at companies and their earnings ... to determine whether or not we're going to have a little bit more of a pullback in the market or not,"" she added. ""And that's based on what they can do going forward, where their opportunities are. And we've been hearing a lot about inflation. If you think about a 7% inflation rate, that's quite significant.""  ""Back in the fall, it was the retail investor that was holding up the market,"" Entwistle said. ""And now, their sentiments have sort of turned and they're no longer optimistic about where we are right now. So I think we have to think about all of these things. We do think that the quality, again, is going to do better than growth."" — Here were the main moves in markets as of 4:01 p.m. ET: S&P 500 (^GSPC): +105.49 (+2.44%) to 4,432.00 Dow (^DJI): +565.42 (+1.66%) to 34,726.20 Nasdaq (^IXIC): +417.79 (+3.13%) to 13,770.57 Crude (CL=F): +$0.55 (+0.64%) to $87.16 a barrel Gold (GC=F): -$5.90 (-0.33%) to $1,789.10 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): -2.5 bps to yield 1.7820% — Robinhood, the digital trading platform popular with retail investors, has seen shares slide by about 67.5% since its initial public offering in July 2021. This has landed the stock among the worst-performing IPOs during the pandemic period, alongside others including the Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global (DIDI), according to Bloomberg data.  Though the stock recovered some losses during intraday trading on Friday, shares had sunk by more than 10% during the overnight session, after the company posted disappointing quarterly results. Net revenue came in at $362.7 million, coming in well below the $370.9 million expected. And monthly active users posted a larger-than-expected quarter-over-quarter decline, dropping by 8.5% to reach 17.3 million. Consensus analysts were looking for 19.9 million monthly users.  — Here's where markets were trading during he afternoon session:  S&P 500 (^GSPC): +42.28 (+0.98%) to 4,368.79 Dow (^DJI): +101.21 (+0.3%) to 34,261.99 Nasdaq (^IXIC): +213.90 (+1.61%) to 13,567.71 Crude (CL=F): +$0.95 (+1.1%) to $87.56 a barrel Gold (GC=F): -$12.20 (-0.68%) to $1,782.80 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): -2.4 bps to yield 1.784% — In a new note, Bank of America economists said that they are expecting the Fed to raise interest rates by 25 basis points seven times this year, representing one of the most hawkish predictions so far for the path forward for the central bank. According to DailyFX.com senior strategist Christopher Vecchio, however, this will ultimately not likely be the path the Fed actually adopts. Still, the highly hawkish prediction highlights just how much more aggressive many market participants are now expecting the Fed to be.  ""I do think that some investors will take this and see it as a sign that the tides have turned quite dramatically, with respect to expectations around Fed policy,"" Vecchio said when asked about Bank of America's outlook on interest rates. ""The market itself, when you look at a variety of measures — if you're looking at eurodollar futures contracts, if you're looking at Fed funds futures — we're still talking about closer to four rate hikes priced in for 2022."" ""So the fact of the matter is, that there is this disconnect between what some banks are saying, and banks talk in their book in part because net interest margin increasing would be beneficial for their bottom line,"" he added. ""There is a disconnect between what banks are predicting and what the market itself is actually predicting.""  ""Historically speaking, the market's been pretty rubbish about predicting which way the Fed is going to go,"" Vecchio noted. ""Always too aggressive or too dovish — it's never in that Goldilocks zone where it ends up nailing the actual path of interest rate hikes. So I would suggest that as the data evolves, as we move forward through this year, the sensitivity to inflation, and more importantly, to those supply chain issues will largely dictate how fast the Fed moves."" — A closely watched index of consumer sentiment slipped at the end of January to reach the lowest level in a decade, signaling consumers were increasingly concerned over rising prices, the ongoing pandemic and emerging geopolitical risks.  The University of Michigan's final January consumer sentiment index fell to 67.2, dipping from the preliminary estimate of 68.8 earlier in the month. This represented the lowest reading since November 2011. Subindices tracking both consumers' expectations for future conditions and assessments of present economic conditions each deteriorated during the month.  ""Overall confidence in government economic policies is at its lowest level since 2014, and the major geopolitical risks may add to the pandemic active confrontations with other countries,"" Richard Curtin, chief economist for the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers, wrote in a press statement.  ""Although their primary concern is rising inflation and falling real incomes, consumers may misinterpret the Fed's policy moves to slow the economy as part of the problem rather than part of the solution,"" he added. ""The danger is that consumers may overreact to these tiny nudges, especially given the uncertainties about the coronavirus and other heightened geopolitical risks.""  — Here's where stocks were trading Friday morning just after the opening bell:  S&P 500 (^GSPC): +10.47 (+0.24%) to 4,336.98 Dow (^DJI): +20.60 (+0.06%) to 34,181.38 Nasdaq (^IXIC): +57.26 (+0.43%) to 13,411.39 Crude (CL=F): +$1.69 (+1.95%) to $88.30 a barrel Gold (GC=F): -$11.60 (-0.65%) to $1,783.40 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +1.7 bps to yield 1.827% — U.S. personal income rose at a lackluster pace in December, logging the smallest gain since September as pandemic-era government assistance programs waned. Personal income rose at a 0.3% month-on-month rate in December, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday, missing estimates for a 0.5% rise, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Income had risen 0.5% in November. Personal spending fell 0.6% during the month, matching consensus estimates. This came marked the first drop since February 2021, and came following a 0.4% rise in. spending in November.  — A key measure of inflation rose at a fresh four-decade high in December, underscoring lingering inflationary pressures in the economy. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index rose 5.8% in December compared to the same month last year, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday. This accelerated from November's 5.7% year-over-year. gain. The print for the final month of 2021 matched consensus estimates, based on Bloomberg data. Month-over-month, PCE rose 0.4% in December, also matching estimates and slowing from November's 0.6% gain.  Excluding food and energy prices, however, the core PCE rose slightly more than expected, logging a 4.9% year-over-year rise versus the 4.8% increase consensus economists had anticipated. This also sped up from November's 4.7% rise in core PCE. Core PCE serves as the Federal Reserve's preferred indicator of underlying price trends.  — Here's where stocks were trading before the opening bell Friday morning: S&P 500 futures (ES=F): -14 points (-0.32%), to 4,303.75 Dow futures (YM=F): -144.00 points (-0.42%), to 33,899.00 Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): +5.75 points (+0.04%) to 13,992.50 Crude (CL=F): +$0.72 (+0.83%) to $87.33 a barrel Gold (GC=F): -$8.30 (-0.46%) to $1,786.70 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +3.8 bps to yield 1.846% — Here's where futures began trading Thursday evening: S&P 500 futures (ES=F): +30 points (+0.69%), to 4,347.75 Dow futures (YM=F): +169 points (+0.5%), to 34,212.00 Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): +169 points (+1.21%) to 14,155.75 — Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

1/29/2022,"This past month has seen the bears come out, as the market has entered a correction. The NASDAQ is down 13% since the start of 2022, a loss that has actually erased its 12-month gain. The S&P 500 hasn’t dipped quite that far yet, but is still down 8% year-to-date. The drop has had investors questioning whether or not the previous year’s sustained bull run has ended. Looking at the macro situation from Oppenheimer, chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus would advise investors not to turn pessimistic quite yet. Stoltzfus believes that the coming months are likely to bring us relief from both the pandemic and the supply chain crisis. Looking ahead, Stoltzfus says, “It would appear to us to be time for writing shopping lists of fundamentally sound stocks, sectors and thematic investment ideas that might ‘have gotten away from us’ in last year’s market upswings…” The stock analysts from Oppenheimer are following Stoltzfus’ lead, and picking out the stocks they see gaining as we march further into 2022. They see the current correction as a chance to buy at a discount, in preparation for better times ahead. Using TipRanks' database, we've located two of those Oppenheimer picks, which the firm expects to surge by 70% or better. Hertz Global (HTZ) We’ll start with one of the world’s most recognized brands, Hertz. The car rental giant operates the Hertz, Dollar, and Thrifty rental companies, and boasts a worldwide reach – more than 10,000 locations in 145 countries on 6 continents. There was a weakness, however, that the COVID pandemic exposed. Hertz depends on a customer base that’s in transit – and the pandemic shut down travel, slamming the company and drastically reducing the value of its chief asset, its extensive car fleet. At the same time, Hertz’s creditors called in their loans, which had been secured by those very car fleets. The combination was too much, and Hertz entered bankruptcy proceedings in May of 2020. After more than a year of litigation and restructuring, the company emerged in July 2021 in a strong position, having discharged $5 billion in debt and secured $5.9 billion in new capital. A look at the last quarterly report, for 3Q21, shows the extent of the company’s turned fortunes. The top line revenue, of $2.2 billion, was up 19% year-over-year, while adjusted diluted EPS, at $1.20, was enormously improved from the 3Q20 EPS loss of 44 cents. The company had $2.7 billion in unrestricted cash as of September 30, 2021. The company will report its Q4 results toward the end of February. In addition to sound financials, Hertz has also been moving to align its business with modern trends. The company is partnering with the used vehicle e-commerce company Carvana to streamline its used car disposition channels. The partnership will see Hertz sell used fleet vehicles through Carvana, to benefit both companies. Also, Hertz is working with Uber and Tesla on a project to electrify its rental fleet, and will be making up to 50,000 Tesla vehicles available to customers who rent through Uber’s network. And last, Hertz has made a move that should please investors. The company announced in November that it has approved a share repurchase program of up to $2 billion. In short, Hertz has emerged from bankruptcy with solid plan to move forward, and the ability to execute on it. Nevertheless, the stock is down 48% from the peak it reached in November of last year. However, Oppenheimer’s Ian Zaffino sees Hertz in solid position, and poised for takeoff. “With a meaningfully improved cost structure, an under-levered balance sheet and newfound competitive discipline, we believe Hertz is an interesting post-bankruptcy equity. The company has the potential to roughly double its pre-COVID EBITDA margins, even as auto production and the operating environment normalize.” He went on to add that “Hertz has been highly forward-looking, as it positions itself for the future of the rental industry. It recently announced agreements with Tesla, Carvana, and Uber. The Tesla deal has the potential to be margin accretive, especially if EVs prove to have better economics. Further, the Carvana partnership expands Hertz’s disposition channel and could add $50M+ to EBITDA.” To this end, Zaffino puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock, not surprising in light of his comments, and his $31 price target implies an upside of 72% for the year ahead. (To watch Zaffino’s track record, click here.) Overall, Hertz shares get a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus on Wall Street. The stock has 6 recent analyst reviews, breaking down to 4 Buys and 2 Holds. The average price target of $30 implies a one-year upside of ~66% from the current share price of $18.01. (See Hertz stock forecast on TipRanks) Vacasa (VCSA) The second Oppenheimer pick we’ll look at is Vacasa, another company that has benefited greatly from the reopening of the economy and the gradual scaling back of COVID restrictions. Vacasa, based in Portland, Oregon, is a vacation management company, connecting vacationers with places to stay. The company operates in 34 US states, plus the countries of Canada, Mexico, Belize, and Costa Rica. It’s homes, totaling more than 35,000, have picked up nearly 300,000 5-star reviews, and Vacasa boasts that it facilitates vacation stays for more than 3 million guests annually. This company went public just this past December, through a SPAC transaction with TPG Pace Solutions Corporation. The deal saw the VCSA ticker start trading on December 7, and brought the company over $340 million in new capital. From one perspective, this company went public at just the right time. Customer behavior trends have shifted favorably in recent months, as people are finding that they can travel and have the funds to do so. The company released its 3Q21 results a few weeks before completing the SPAC transaction, and showed record revenue of $330 million. That was a 77% gain year-over-year, and beat the company’s quarterly revenue target by 28%. The company sold over 1.8 million vacation nights in Q3, well above the 1.1 million sold in the year-ago quarter. Looking forward, Vacasa raised its full-year 2021 revenue guidance by more than $100 million, to the range of $872 million to $877 million. A look at the company’s stock price chart may seem worrisome at first glance. The stock is down ~40% since going public. However, Oppenheimer analyst Jed Kelly does not see reason to worry, and in fact, believes that Vacasa is in the process of becoming the leader in its market. “VCSA is leveraging its positioning as the largest vacation rental management platform in the US to increase its scale advantages and acquire outsized inventory share as consumer preference for the segment grows. We see this dynamic facilitating VCSA's evolution into a national hospitality brand and generating upward revisions to LT estimates. Additionally, we expect a robust demand environment continuing in '22,” Kelly noted. ""We see more liquidity (6/5/22 lockup), and strong execution enabling VCSA to close the valuation gap with its online travel peers,"" the analyst summed up. Kelly thinks the stock has some way to go, and by some way, we mean 96% of upside. Those are the returns investors are looking at, should the stock make it all the way to Kelly's $12 price target. No need to add, the analyst’s rating is a Buy. (To watch Kelly’s track record, click here) All in all, Vacasa currently holds a Moderate Buy rating from Wall Street’s analysts; in its short time as a public company, it has picked up 4 Buy reviews against 2 Holds. The stock is selling for $6.10 and has a bullish 103% upside potential based on the $12.40 average price target.
