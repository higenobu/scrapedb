3/6/2022,"Shane Warne’s children are in “complete shock” at the sudden death of the Australian cricket great, telling his manager the past 24 hours have felt like “a bad dream”. James Erskine, Warne’s longtime representative, has offered insight into his client and friend’s final moments, revealing he had “just finished” a new weight-loss regime when he suffered a suspected heart attack in Thailand. He also recounted the difficult conversations he had with the 52-year-old’s family on Saturday. Erskine was the person who broke the news to Warne’s three children, Brooke, 24, Jackson, 22, and Summer, 20, and former wife Simone Callahan. “I think the three children are in complete shock,” Erskine told the Nine Network on Sunday. “I spoke to them yesterday and again and Jackson just said, ‘we expect him to walk in the door. This is like a bad dream’. “I spoke with Simone who was really upset and obviously Keith, Shane’s father, is a pretty strong individual but, like everybody, he’s just shattered. They can’t believe what’s happened. I think that’s what happens when you have a sudden death you’re not expecting. “One minute the kids are talking to him every day, the next minute they can’t talk to him and they start thinking about, ‘he’s not going to be there for my 21st, he’s not going to take me down the aisle’. Those things go through your head. They are having a much harder time than anybody, really.” Warne died while on holiday in Koh Samui, where he had planned to get back into shape after a long summer covering the Ashes. Erskine said he had been one day into a three-month holiday. “He decided to go to Thailand just to relax, have a bit of time out and then they were going to meet for a drink at 5pm,” he said. “He was always on time, Warnie. Then at quarter past five Neo knocked on his door and no answer so he wandered in and said, ‘Come on, Warnie, wake up. Wake up’. Realised there was something wrong and that started a 20-minute procedure of CPR … and unfortunately he was then put in an ambulance and when he got to the hospital he was pronounced dead.” Erskine said Warne regularly put himself on “ridiculous” diets when attempting to lose weight. “He was just finished one, where he basically only ate fluids for 14 days, and he’d done this three or four times,” Erskine said. “It was a bit all or nothing. It was either white buns with butter and lasagne stuffed in the middle, or he would be having black and green juices. “He obviously smoked most of his life [but] I don’t know, I think it was just a massive heart attack.” Erskine said Warne was “the sort of person that literally could talk to the Queen of England and the dust bin man at the same time”. “In fact, he could almost persuade the Queen to take out his dust bins.” It comes as Liz Hurley posted a tribute to her former fiance on Instagram. “I feel like the sun has gone behind a cloud forever. RIP my beloved Lionheart,” the British actor and model wrote alongside several photos of the pair together. Warne and Hurley began dating in 2010, after the breakdown of his marriage to Callahan, and he proposed 18 months later “completely on impulse” on Australian billionaire James Packer’s boat. “I can honestly say that the time I had with Elizabeth were the happiest years of my life,” he wrote in his autobiography, No Spin. The pair split in 2013, citing work commitments after she took on a role on television show, The Royals. Hurley’s son, Damian, also posted a tribute on Instagram alongside a series of family photos. “I’m still trying to wrap my head around this … SW was a father figure to me for most of my formative years and was truly one of the best men I’ve ever known,” Damian wrote. “My heart is broken. Thinking of and sending love to all SW’s family.”",Sport/Sport,‘Complete shock’: Shane Warne’s family shattered after cricket great’s sudden death,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/06/complete-shock-shane-warnes-family-shattered-after-sudden-death
3/6/2022,"Peter Dutton has stepped back from his earlier prediction that Australia would join a conflict to defend Taiwan, saying the government would decide “at that time as to what was in our country’s best interests”. The defence minister also said the strength of the international response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “significantly wounded” the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and hoped this would prompt China’s Xi Jinping to reassess the costs of aggressive action against Taiwan. Dutton said Australian-supplied lethal military equipment had arrived in Ukraine. While he did not disclose “how we’ve got it into the hands of the Ukrainians” he signalled that Australia stood ready to provide further help. In an interview with the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday, Dutton hit out at what he called an “unholy alliance” between Russia and China – the agreement Putin and Xi unveiled a month ago to formalise a “no limits” partnership. While Dutton said it was important for Australia to “do whatever we can to deter China from acts of aggression in our region”, he did not repeat his previous formulation about what Australia would do in the event of a military conflict over Taiwan. In November Dutton was accused of straying from longstanding bipartisan policy when he told the Australian newspaper that it “would be inconceivable that we wouldn’t support the US in an action if the US chose to take that action”. The US maintains “strategic ambiguity” about whether it would come to the defence of Taiwan, the democratically governed island of 24 million people that Beijing claims as its breakaway province. In November, Dutton denied he was pre-committing Australia to war, but added: “Maybe there are circumstances where we wouldn’t take up that option, (but) I can’t conceive of those ­circumstances.” On Sunday, however, Dutton appeared to be more cautious with his language about Taiwan. “We would take interest in any of those conflicts or the threat of conflict that serve our national interest,” he said. Pressed specifically on whether he still believed it would be inconceivable that Australia would not support the US in an action over Taiwan, Dutton said: “If it’s in our national interest to protect our homeland and our allies, then we would take that decision at that time as to what was in our country’s best interests.” Dutton said Russia was incurring “reputational risk” at the current time and Xi “would have to question whether or not he would want that similar response”. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, spoke by phone with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Saturday night. Morrison said he had “praised Ukraine’s courage against Russia’s aggression” and the pair had “discussed ways we could assist further”. Zelenskiy tweeted that he had briefed Morrison on “the course of war” and “risks to people and the environment due to the threat to Ukrainian nuclear and chemical facilities”. Dutton said Ukrainians had “put up a magnificent resistance so far, but there is a sense inevitability when you look at the strength and sheer numbers and also the propensity for Putin to use chemical weapons or other weapons which would be used in a residential area”. In the ABC interview, Dutton repeatedly referred to Ukraine by the incorrect name “the Ukraine”. The 1991 constitution refers to Ukraine as a sovereign state, and Australia’s ambassador has previously cautioned against the defunct phrasing: With increased focus & attention being paid to Ukraine (NOT the Ukraine), an opportune time to remind all outlets that it’s #KyivNotKiev.@CNN made the change recently, so a good model for @7NewsAustralia to follow.@kyivnotkievch https://t.co/52g1hyRApf Dutton said it was clear that Putin “has a view of erasing history and of conquering those countries around him and bringing back a re-unified USSR”. “That is the view out of the Ukraine, the view out of the intelligence analysts and that is what concerns Nato and the world as well,” he said. “Does it stop at the Ukraine or does it provide them with a greater foothold in Europe and a launching pad then into another country? “We need to be very clear about his intention, his capability. I think he has been significantly wounded out of this, both domestically and in terms of the international reputation that people have of Russia, and I think there will be internal discussions about the viability of his leadership going forward.” Dutton backed Nato’s reluctance to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying such a move would only help “if it didn’t lead to a nuclear conflict”. Putin warned on Saturday that such a no-fly zone “would bring catastrophic results not only to Europe but to the whole world”. The Russian leader also leader likened the measures designed to cripple his country’s economy as “akin to an act of war”. Putin said Ukraine’s leaders must “understand that if they continue doing what they are doing, they risk the future of Ukrainian statehood”. The Labor party’s defence spokesperson, Brendan O’Connor, said the Australian government had “done the right thing” in condemning Russia’s invasion, ratcheting up sanctions and providing lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine. “Insofar as what we may do if elected, we will continue to do what the international community are doing in working together to put as much pressure on President Putin as possible in order to see the end of this terrible conflict,” O’Connor told Sky News. Dutton raised the possibility of a pre-election announcement on nuclear-powered submarines as part of the Aukus deal with the US and the UK. “We will have an announcement within the next couple of months about which boat we are going with, what we can do in the interim,” he said. Dutton said Australia’s discussions with the US and the UK were “incredibly productive”. While Morrison has previously said the first submarine was expected to be in the water by about 2040, Dutton argued Australia would “acquire the capability much sooner than that” although he did not nominate a new date.",News/Australia news,Dutton dials back language on Australia defending Taiwan in a potential war with China,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/06/dutton-dials-back-language-on-australia-defending-taiwan-from-chinese-aggression
3/6/2022,"The towns of the New South Wales northern rivers are used to floods – they are part of the region’s history and a product of its geography. But this time was different. The speed at which flood waters rose, the sheer volume of water and the scale of the damage caught many by surprise. Politicians are calling these floods a once-in-a-100, or even a once-in-a-1,000-year event, but in reality these catastrophic weather events are becoming more intense and more frequent. In Wilsons Creek, about 5km from Mullumbimby, flood waters rushed through the valley on Monday causing immense destruction, with most of the houses built along the river flooded. Sahar Zadah, who lives in the valley with her husband and her two children, said that when the water came crashing through the valley it was “one roaring, terrifying sound” and was so powerful that 10 cars were washed downstream, “torn to pieces as if a bomb went off”. Landslides at Upper Wilsons Creek, Huonbrook and Wanganui picked up vehicles, destroyed roads and bridges, ripped out water tanks and in one case demolished a whole house. Another landslide killed a woman. “The landslides were next level in terms of destruction,” Zahar said. Sahar’s sister, Shafiqa Irwin, and her partner, Alex Heilpern, were caught inside their home in Upper Wilsons Creek when it collapsed due to a landslide. They heard a rumble and within a second they were covered in wreckage, with Irwin trapped beneath rubble, both her legs broken. She screamed for Alex but he had been knocked unconscious by the impact. When he came to, he managed to free Shafiqa and they walked to a neighbour’s house, despite her horrific injuries. Sarah Black, a Mullumbimby paramedic, and a community member named Richard hiked four hours through partially destroyed roads and landslides to treat the pair and bring them morphine, as there was no access for ambulance services. They spent 24 hours with the injured couple before they were rescued by helicopter, 38 hours after the house first collapsed. Shafiqa is now at the Gold Coast University hospital and is expected to need extensive surgery on both her ankles. She and Alex did not have insurance on their home, and with all their possessions destroyed, they have set up a GoFundMe page. “People are breaking down here. It’s so sad. We are barely coping. But we are supporting each other as best as we can,” Sahar said. With the community isolated, Wilsons Creek locals Steve Brown and his three sons Jai, Josh and Ben began using excavators to fix the roads. The routes they have created are for emergency use only, but they have allowed energy providers in to restore some electricity . Over on the coast, the suburbs of New Brighton, South Golden Beach and Ocean Shores also succumbed to rapidly rising rivers. Raffaella Baker and Anthony Gadsden, together with their one-year-old daughter Bowie, woke at 2am on Monday to find water rising around their riverside home in New Brighton. By the time the SES evacuation message was sent at 5am, there was no escape. Instead, they watched the water rise towards their second storey. “We never thought it would get that bad that quickly,” Raffaella said. “It all happened very fast.” Phone and internet services were cutting in and out, but Raffaella managed to get hold of her mother who notified the SES that they were in trouble. With letterboxes and landmarks submerged, rescuers had difficulty locating them. The heavy rain muffled their calls for help and the tree canopy hid their home when boats passed by. “That was actually quite scary,” Raffaella said. It was only after their neighbour paddled his surfboard around to their house that emergency services found them. Rafaella and Bowie stayed with Raffaella’s sister, Billie Baker, in East Ballina before the floods arrived four days later. Ballina residents were then also evacuated. Baker said Ballina was a disaster zone, with locals using boats and jetskis to evacuate people and animals. “No one is helping. There’s no police or services, apart from the SES and surf lifesaving clubs. There are just volunteers. Where are the professionals?” Baker asked. In Burringbar, about 20km south-east of Murwillumbah, Sean and Emily Marshall, and their one-year-old daughter Delila, were woken by a knock at the door at 10.30pm on Monday night. Their neighbour warned them that the flood water was rising. At that time, the flood water was at the bottom of the stairs that lead to their back door. Thinking they had plenty of time, the family went back to sleep, but by midnight the water had risen halfway up the back steps. By 3am the water was only two steps away from their back door. At this point, they decided to move Emily and Delila to the neighbour’s house, which was elevated higher than theirs. It was pitch black and they couldn’t see what was in the water or where it was coming from. As they crossed, it was hard to keep steady footing and they feared if they slipped they might lose their daughter. “It was not powerful, but still dangerous. But that was our only chance to get out,” Sean said. They managed to navigate the crossing and Sean passed Delilah and Emily to their neighbours before returning to secure their house. The knee-high water had turned into waist-high rapids and Sean was isolated. There were no emergency services. “The rain was at Tweed Heads, then it circled back and it evolved into a rain bomb. It just kept raining and raining,” Sean said. As the downpour intensified, water rushed into the family’s yard. Fences were torn away; wheelie bins, ride-on mowers, and heavy machinery were picked up by the torrent. Sean made all sorts of attempts to divert water away from their house. He sandbagged the home, put plywood at the front door and a mattress at the back to stop water from entering. He tried using roof sheets, surfboards and paddleboards to direct the flow. All the items they had stored under the house were taken by the floods. The water under the house was chest-high and life-threatening to navigate, submerging one of the family’s cars. Just a few months earlier they had stopped paying for flood insurance, which was costing them upwards of $1,100 a month. “The premiums are expensive, and they’re going to be even more expensive now. Five years ago, that was a 100-year flood. So there was no thought that was going to happen again,” Sean said. The rain peaked at 3pm. The woman across the street from Sean was stranded on her second-floor balcony. There was no one coming to help her if the water kept rising but thankfully by about 5pm the rain had subsided. Thanks to Sean’s efforts the water hadn’t entered the family’s home, but only by a few inches. The next day they returned to their house to begin the clean up. “The problem now is you’re going to have insects, snakes, rats, mice,” Sean said. Conditions in the region remain dire and residents are angry. Communities have been left without electricity, internet, or phone reception and access to food, clean water and medical supplies is limited. Residents say the failure of authorities to deliver essential services has hampered evacuations and put lives at risk. Locals are not just sitting waiting for help, however. Mullumbimby Civic Centre became a hub for volunteers wanting to assist residents of the flood-damaged town but also to distribute aid. Eddie Dostine, from Byron Bay, and a crew of volunteers hiked food and petrol supplies into Main Arm, doorknocking homes to check on residents. Another group of young people brought chainsaws and tools to build bridges over causeways and landslides so people could access the area with quads and motorbikes. “It felt weird not helping,” Eddie said.",News/Australia news,‘Next level destruction’: NSW residents detail the moments floods devastated their homes,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/06/next-level-destruction-nsw-residents-detail-the-moments-floods-devastated-their-homes
