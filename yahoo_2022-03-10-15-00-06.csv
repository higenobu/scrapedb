3/10/2022,"Former President Donald Trump somehow turned a question about the Ukraine crisis into an opportunity to bemoan windmills during an appearance on the “Full Send” podcast hosted by YouTubers. “What do you see happening next, then? Cause it seems like the tensions are high. How does this all end? Is this going to be a long-term thing? How do you see it unfolding?” Nelk Boys founder Kyle Forgeard asked the former president during a sit-down discussion about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Well, and I said this a long time ago, if this happens, we are playing right into their hands. Green energy. The windmills don’t work. They’re too expensive. They kill all the birds. They ruin your landscapes,” Trump answered. “And yet the environmentalists love the windmills. And I’ve been preaching this for years. The windmills ― and I had them way down ― but the windmills are the most expensive energy you can have. And they don’t work.” Trump has a long-documented hatred of wind turbines, ever since a protracted and failed legal fight to stop Scottish officials from building what he called a “really ugly wind farm” in view of his Aberdeen golf resort. He routinely spouts bizarre lies about windmills, including the widely-mocked claim that the noise they make causes cancer. He continued to discuss windmills for some time before telling an anecdote about giving a “white flag” as a gift to former German Chancellor Angela Merkel over discussions about Nord Stream 2, a controversial natural gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. Both the U.S. and U.K. are banning oil imports from Russia to punish the Kremlin for its war on Ukraine, causing a spike in already-high gas prices for Americans. It seems Trump was citing a theory in right-wing circles that the crisis in Ukraine was a ploy to push alternative energy, as rising gas prices could force the adaption of cleaner energy such as wind turbines. Last month, for example, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson suggested that the Biden administration was provoking conflict with Russia to make a play against fossil fuels and push for renewable energy.

3/10/2022,"Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky won the hearts of the western world recently when, upon the recent invasion of his country by Russia, he refused an offer from the U.S. to help him evacuate from the capital city of Kyiv. “I need ammunition, not a ride,” he famously said.

Find: How Rich Is Former President Donald Trump? As the war in the Ukraine rages on, rumors abound online regarding Zelensky’s net worth, including assets such as homes and vehicles. Estimates have ranged from $1.5 million USD to half a billion dollars, all the way up to a staggering $1.5 billion. Some news sources speculate that tweets declaring the former comedian’s net worth at $1.5 billion were efforts to undermine support for Zelensky and the Ukraine. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Zelensky is worth roughly $1.5 million — not $1.5 billion. The site says that the president’s financial disclosure from 2018 listed total assets worth 37 million hryvnias, the Ukrainian currency. At the time, that gave him a net worth of $1.5 million USD, although, due to foreign exchange rates, the amount fluctuates. Zelensky earned most of his money as a Ukrainian entertainer, starring in Russian-language films including “Love in the Big City,” “Office Romance,” and “8 First Dates.” The tri-lingual president, who is fluent in Russian, Ukrainian, and English, also dubbed the Ukrainian voiceovers for “Paddington”and “Paddington 2.” From 2015 to 2019, he starred in a political satire comedy series, “Servant of the People.” The oddly prophetic show, which aired for 51 episodes, chronicled the adventures of a high school teacher turned president of the Ukraine. In 2019, Zelensky ran for office and was elected as president. Although this marked Zelensky’s first foray into politics, he does have the education to back up his recent career change. He graduated from Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics with a law degree, but never practiced, according to ClutchPoints. Learn: How Much Is Vice President Kamala Harris Worth?

Zelensky’s current role as Ukrainian president earns him only 28,000 Hryvnias annually, or just $930 per month, per Celebrity Net Worth — which is an annual salary of roughly $11,200 per year.

3/10/2022,"“Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling has doubled (tripled? quadrupled?) down on her transphobic comments, this time in regards to the proposed amendments to the Gender Recognition Reform Bill in Scotland, which made headlines days before International Women’s Day on March 8. The Scottish legislation, under First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, is a planned reform of gender laws that will make it easier for people to legally change gender, including obtaining a gender recognition certification, removing the requirement of a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, and allowing trans people to self-identify on legal documents. Under the new rules, to obtain such a certification, people need to live in their acquired gender for at least three months, followed by a further three-month reflection period, before the certificate is to be granted. The age limit for gender recognition will also be reduced to 16 from the current 18. More from IndieWire Jonathan Bailey on Not Hiding His Sexuality to Get Roles: 'Reached a Point Where I Thought, F*ck This' Animation Guild Slams Disney CEO's 'Disheartening' Response to 'Don't Say Gay' Bill: A 'Momentous Misstep' Rowling tweeted on March 5, “Multiple women’s groups have presented well-sourced evidence to @NicolaSturgeon’s government about the likely negative consequences of this legislation for women and girls, especially the most vulnerable. All has been ignored. If the legislation is passed and those consequences ensue as a result, the @SNP govt can’t pretend it wasn’t warned.” Nicola Sturgeon is the First Minister of Scotland and Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), and the first woman to hold either position. Rowling also retweeted the 2018 conviction of a trans woman who allegedly attempted to rape a 10-year-old girl. Rowling called it a “parody.” Other Scottish groups have criticized the proposed bill for potentially infringing on women’s sex-based rights and access to women-only spaces and services, as Metro UK stated. Rowling, who identifies as a sexual assault survivor, tweeted on March 8, “Someone please send the Shadow Minister for Equalities a dictionary and a backbone. #HappyInternationalWomensDay” after Shadow Minister of Equalities Anneliese Dodds said there are open interpretations to the term “women,” as The Daily Mail reported. Rowling clapped back at International Women’s Day itself, “Apparently, under a Labour government, today will become We Who Must Not Be Named Day.” First Minister Sturgeon said she “fundamentally disagreed” with Rowling’s criticisms while on The World At One on BBC Radio 4, as reported by Metro UK. “She’s clearly free to express her opinion, as am I, as is everybody. But that’s not what this debate is about,” Sturgeon said. “The legislation was introduced to parliament last week and it will now go through a full legislative process with all the normal parliamentary scrutiny.” Sturgeon continued, “This is about a process, an existing process, by which people can legally change their gender, and it’s about making that process less traumatic and inhumane for trans people, one of the most stigmatized minorities in our society. It doesn’t give trans people any more rights, doesn’t give trans people one single additional right that they don’t have right now. Nor does it take away from women any of the current existing rights that women have under the Equalities Act.” Long vocal in her anti-trans views, Rowling previously said that trans people should be defined by their biological sex by arguing that “if sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction” in 2020. Rowling briefly quit Twitter before sharing an essay elaborating on her views and tweeting it out with the caption, “TERF wars.” TERF stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist and is used as a term to describe feminists who are transphobic. Rowling’s comments led “Harry Potter” cast members including Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint to issue statements in June 2020 in support of the trans community. Warner Bros., the studio behind the “Harry Potter” films, later issued a response to Rowling’s stance promoting inclusion.
