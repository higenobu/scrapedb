3/8/2022,"The Black Women Photographers collective, established via a Covid-19 relief fund, is approaching its second year of promoting and empowering Black women female photographers, as well as increasing the visibility of their work. In March, a virtual summit supported by Adobe will feature Raven B Varona, Kimberly Douglas, aka @kihmberlie, Audrey Woulard, Lola Flash, Lola Akinmade Åkerström, Amanda J Cain, NHL’s first Black woman team photographer, Whitney Matewe, DeLovie Kwagala, Cheriss May, Sade Ndya, Chaya Howell, and Idara Ekpoh. 2017: My friends Dara and Isioma, who I have known since 2008 in boarding school. This photo was taken at one of our many mini-alumni meetups. After spending six years of the most formative parts of our adolescence in a remote school campus – loving, hating and knowing each other – we can say that we come from each other. Above all else, International Women’s Day (IWD) is like all other days: every day I am a woman and every day is my day. But what I appreciate about IWD is that it is usually a call to think more about our identity as women and the boundaries we make or contest around that identity.

Notwithstanding, for me, the day becomes a plea and a reminder for us to think more about what it means to be a woman in our various societies. While I understand and appreciate the need to celebrate women’s achievements in our misogynistic world, events that reify gender, like IWD, have become opportunities for me to think more about the role of gender. And when I am not in the mood for hard thoughts, IWD is a day to text my mum, aunties, sisters and friends that *clink-clink* emoji because, chale, it’s not easy being a woman. 2021- At a friend’s birthday party. © Immaculata Abba I am here and alive today because of redemptions I find when I am in community with other women. The way we have learned to stand tall for ourselves, to hold each other when we can’t stand, and to tell ourselves the truth about what keeps us from standing ... these are the things that have brought me here.

As I consider this, I am using this day to reflect on the impact that the women I photograph have had on me and my work. Hadizah Atta from the series Identity – the Nigerian Woman. For me, it’s a day of recognising women and camaraderie with each other and support. It means unity, it means that women from all over the world can see women do something for their own countries. It means another day for women to be celebrated. I honestly welcome any excuse to celebrate women, especially in this part of the world.

3/8/2022,"Tens of thousands of Sydney residents have been forced from their homes as floods unleashed carnage across Australia’s largest city and claimed the lives of a mother and son. Australia’s death toll from the east coast floods rose to 21 on Tuesday as a massive stretch of the New South Wales coast endured dangerous winds and heavy rains, causing landslides and wild surf conditions as a second east coast low in a week moved in. Some 50,000 people were told to leave their homes across NSW including 40,000 residents in more than a dozen Sydney suburbs including the northern beaches. Two bodies were discovered in western Sydney on Tuesday morning – a 67-year-old mother and her 34-year-old son from Wentworthville. Their abandoned car was found earlier and their deaths took the NSW toll to eight. Thirteen people have died in Queensland’s floods. The worst of the NSW flooding on Tuesday affected Sydney’s northern suburbs and northern beaches. Roseville Bridge, which crosses Middle Harbour, was inundated trapping cars and causing major delays. Residents in low-lying areas below Manly Dam were urged to evacuate as the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, warned the dam had begun spilling, potentially affecting some 2,000 people in 800 homes. The State Emergency Service later amended the order to an evacuation warning as water levels at the dam dropped slightly. In nearby Dee Why, water up to a metre deep surged down a main thoroughfare. Pittwater Road becomes Pittwater river with flooding in Dee Why #sydneyfloods #deewhy #northernbeaches pic.twitter.com/9E9hFQu91N At Mackellar girls campus in Manly Vale, students watched cars float past the windows in deep water. One parent at the school said her daughter had to wade through water to get out of the school. “An email was sent about 1pm advising us to pick up kids from Quirk Road. They were calling kids’ names as we arrived over the loudspeaker to leave. “Water was over the top of cars and spilling into the bottom levels of the lower blocks. My daughter had to walk through knee-deep water to get out as she was in the hall.” There were 64 evacuation orders in place on Tuesday evening from the Kempsey CBD in northern NSW down to the Illawarra region south of Sydney, with a further 17 evacuation warnings affecting another 18,000 people. Among the latest orders was one for Narrabeen on Sydney’s northern beaches which were being hammered by hazardous surf that will last into Thursday for a lot of the NSW coast. The Bureau of Meteorology updated its warning for damaging winds and heavy rain for an area ranging from near Newcastle southwards towards Bega. “Damaging winds averaging 60 to 80 km/h with peak gusts of around 110 km/h are possible over the coastal fringes of the Illawarra and Sydney metropolitan districts this evening,” it said.Heavy rainfall threatened to produce flash flooding in the southern parts of the Hunter, Sydney metro region, Illawarra and northern parts of the south coast districts, the bureau said. Rainfall totals in the next six hours could be between 70mm to 100 mm. Sydney itself has had its wettest start to any year, with 821.6mm as of Tuesday morning, well ahead of 1956, the nearest rival period, Ben Domensino, a Weatherzone meteorologist said. By Tuesday evening, the tally had risen by another 41mm. Some of Tuesday’s heaviest falls were centred on the northern parts of Sydney, with 102mm recorded at Monavale Golf Club in the three hours to 3.30 pm. Other big totals include 124mm at Forestville over a six-hour period and 128.5mm at Mosman in a similar timeframe. Authorities closed many of the main roads surrounding the Georges River in the south-west of the city, including Henry Lawson Drive and Milperra Road, with entire sections of streets completely underwater. The three major routes into the northern beaches were closed to all traffic, shutting thousands of residents out of the CBD. Many residents could only watch on as the water swallowed up their homes and cars. Thousands of residents in the south-west were ordered to evacuate on Monday night as heavy rain swelled rivers. The usually bustling Newbridge Road was closed by authorities, with the river having risen up to 3.65m earlier on Tuesday, and with the water reaching up to 1.5m in homes. Angelo Testa and Oliver Bucha were steering their dinghy along their street in Chipping Norton, helping neighbours and transporting supplies. Testa, a boat broker, said the first level of his parent’s home was completely underwater, and that it was the second time in three days their home had flooded. “We got about a metre and a half of water, it’s the second time in three days, it’s been absolutely crazy. But it is what it is. Water comes up, then goes down,” he shrugged. “We had a guy walking through last night, with water up to his neck. We picked him up and took him to the end of the street, we’ve had people stuck in their houses, who had initially decided to wait out the flood but found they couldn’t.” Anthony Lippis, who lives just off Newbridge Road, said the water came into his home “in a flash”. “I lost my car, and we didn’t have enough time to save it. It’s heartbreaking. Every time this happens we need to move everything up a level, and it is exhausting, it’s devastating for everybody.” The Blue Mountains was declared a natural disaster area as landslips and collapsed roads wreaked havoc on commuters. “These thunderstorms are slow-moving. Intense rainfall that may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is likely,” the Bureau of Meteorology said. Dean Narramore from the bureau said it had been a “devastating week” for the state, with the conditions not expected to ease until Thursday. “Both the Hawkesbury River and the Nepean River are in danger of major flooding with many locations experiencing levels equal to or greater than what we saw in March of 2021.” #SevereThunderstormWarning updated for #Intense rainfall that will lead to life threatening flash flooding and possible landslides for parts of northeast #Sydney. Full warning here: https://t.co/YirEXV8NvB pic.twitter.com/588mpfXIsy There were 25 flood warnings in place across NSW from the mid-north coast to the south coast, while all but two of the state’s major dams were at 100% capacity. At Kempsey, the Macleay River was expected to peak at 6.3m on Tuesday evening near the major flood level of 6.6m. The last time flood waters reached that level was in the 2013 floods when the river reached 7.1m. Other rivers, including the Hawkesbury-Nepean, were flooding at levels exceeding last week and surpassing March 2021. At North Richmond, the Hawkesbury River was expected to reach around 14.2m on Tuesday evening, with higher rises possible. The SES had conducted 147 flood rescues in the 24 hours to 4pm on Tuesday with almost 3,000 calls for assistance. Nearly 900 people were in temporary accommodation. Perrottet said there needed to be “frank assessments” of the state’s disaster mitigation strategies once the severe weather event had subsided.

3/8/2022,"How did the audience behave last time you went to a concert? Were most people on their feet, drink in hand, perhaps dancing or singing along? Or were they – were you – sitting quietly and still? Your answer will probably depend on what sort of music was being performed and in what kind of venue. Behaviour considered entirely acceptable at a heavy metal gig is unlikely to be welcomed today in an opera house. And the kind of participation you might treasure at an intimate folk session would probably get you removed from a concert hall. For well over a century, in fact, audiences at most classical music performances have been expected to adhere to certain behavioural norms: immobility, concentration (or at least its outward appearance) and, above all, silence. Initially those “ideals” were encouraged by venues themselves, keen to instil an atmosphere of bourgeois respectability as newly monied middle-class punters gained entry to previously aristocratic spaces. In the mid-19th century, silent attentiveness was celebrated as the modern, educated way to consume culture – allowing the ever-acerbic composer Hector Berlioz to snipe that whereas Italian opera audiences just “eat sorbets, gamble and chatter”, Parisian operagoers such as himself actually wanted “to see and to hear”. No wonder that when a new opera house opened in 1840 in what was then Constantinople, audience members were handed a leaflet specifying the rules: “No fighting for seats, no smoking and no noise.” These days, audience behaviour is more likely to be policed by other concertgoers. Overloud whispering is met with flurries of “Shhh!”, rustling attracts glares, and even the correct timing of applause continues to provoke debate. Put bluntly, the 21st-century classical music world is one where the 19th-century ideas about cultural consumption continue to shape assumptions about the relationship between performers and their audiences. There are exceptions, of course. The classical “club nights” run in east London by the music promoter and record label Nonclassical, for instance, where orchestral pieces feature alongside DJ sets while drinks and conversation flow in the background. Or the so-called “relaxed performances” intended to be more accessible to young children, neurodiverse audiences and those with sensory sensitivities now offered by classical mainstays such as Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and English National Opera. They’re an essential step towards making classical music more welcoming to more people. Yet ENO’s advertisement that “During these performances, we have a laid back approach to noise and movement coming from the audience” speaks volumes about what’s still expected the rest of the time. The creative potential of the relationship between performers and audience has preoccupied Berlin-based Australian composer Cathy Milliken for decades. A founding member of contemporary music powerhouse Ensemble Modern, Milliken has composed numerous concert works, installations and radio plays for performance by professional musicians. But she has also produced a large catalogue of participatory pieces and collaborative compositions in which amateur musicians or audience members contribute as performers and creators. “How much more can music in concert halls become even more elevated, even more the best of the best?” Milliken put it when I spoke to her on Zoom (her Australian accent occasionally inflected by German word order). It’s wonderful if more people can access classical music venues, she says – but she’s also adamant that such institutions “must continue to have as active, hands-on and participatory approach as possible”. That way lies what Milliken sees as the holy grail of music today: “creating curiosity” among audiences. An invitation to embrace precisely such curiosity underpins her most recent participatory work, Night Shift. Premiered last year in Berlin, the piece will receive its UK premiere in a new version at London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall on 10 March, performed by London Sinfonietta, professional vocal soloists, two community choirs (the CityLit Inclusive Choir and Sing Tower Hamlets) – and its audience. Everyone in the hall will be given a “Wonderbag” full of sound-making objects, from sheets of paper to stones and tiny bells. The resulting piece isn’t just a free-for-all: “What the audience plays, and where, is also in the score,” Milliken says. And it’s down to the conductor and vocal soloists to coordinate the various musical forces. “I just take part with the others,” she grins. Audience participation isn’t new even in classical music. Two centuries ago, aristocratic audience members regularly clambered onstage to take part in operatic ball scenes. But they still returned to their boxes when the dance number was over. Milliken’s Night Shift, by contrast, largely dissolves the fourth wall that has so long divided audience and performers – and with it, the relative significance of one group over the other: “In the invitation to the public to play, it’s very clear that at the moment they’re playing paper, the musicians are playing paper, too. There’s no hierarchy of material or anything like that.” Elsewhere Milliken has stressed that Night Shift is about “everyone in the hall making music together, a huge democracy” – a vision far removed from the familiar setup of performers physically separated from a silent, passive audience. But Milliken’s most energising challenge to classical music’s conventions today may be her own irrepressible curiosity as a listener: her fascination with alternative, more accessible forms of musical enchantment, beyond those dependent on the listening conditions created by 19th-century social etiquette. “A little bit of aluminium foil crinkling e-e-ever so slowly,” she muses, “that’s for me quite a heavenly thing.”  The UK premiere of Cathy Milliken’s Night Shift, with the London Sinfonietta conducted by Jonathan Stockhammer, is at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London on 10 March.",Arts/Music,Now pull the other one it’s got bells on: the concert where the audience makes the music,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/08/night-shift-cathy-milliken-london-sinfonietta-audience-participation
3/8/2022,"I never enjoyed oral sex with my ex-husband, who was my only romantic partner in 40 years. Since my divorce, I have had sex with a couple of men, both of whom wanted to perform oral sex on me. This is something I have never felt comfortable with. Is it me? I feel I can never be clean enough, or that I may smell. Friends tell me it is awesome, and I do want the best sex with my new partners, but I worry that there is something wrong with me. There is no law that says you have to like everything. You do not have to accept a sexual behaviour just because it is enjoyed by friends, or popularised in movies. Focus on the things you enjoy, and teach your partner what they are – and exactly how. Most men are aroused by their partner’s enjoyment, so share your passions fully and genuinely.

3/8/2022,"‘Iremember the tampon dipped in Ribena,” says Josie Dale-Jones, her fingertips pressed together as if holding on to the string. “The way it swelled up immediately.” In school, Dale-Jones recalls her sex and relationships education as being “near to non-existent”. There was the purple-soaked tampon, the classic condom rolled on to a banana and the “general fear-mongering” of pictures of STIs pinned up on a board. “But never a mention of why you might want to have sex,” she says, rolling her eyes. “Never anything about empathy or pleasure, or how any of it might impact other people.” With a team of eight performers, Dale-Jones is making a show about sex and relationships for ages five and above. Accompanied by workshops and panel talks, The Family Sex Show tackles topics including boundaries, gender, relationships and masturbation. Through a series of artistic responses and conversations, the group want to help make it easier for anyone, of any age, to talk about these sticky, tricky topics. “I don’t know another subject that we only talk about once and then we tick it off as if it’s done,” Dale-Jones says. “The learning is never over.” The argument against sex education for younger ages has repeatedly been that education is indoctrination: the more we tell our children about sex, the more tempted they will be. “But there’s so much research that shows the complete opposite,” Dale-Jones says. Avoiding conversations about our bodies and how we use them, she suggests, is far more dangerous. “Knowing your body is about knowing your rights. The more we know, the more we can protect ourselves and each other.” Children aren’t anxious about the idea of the show, she insists. “It’s the older people who feel discomfort in something that’s challenging their preconceptions.” Her argument is that our understanding of our bodies is critical, for lots of reasons besides sex. “More than half of all children have already experienced body image-based bullying before they leave school. If we’re teaching ideas of ableism and homophobia and racism and queerphobia, why can’t we teach the opposite?” Early on, the team made the decision for the production to only explore the positive aspects of sex and relationships. “We get the negative and the complex every day. If we make the choice to only put forward positive role models, what impact could that have?” They don’t shy away from the humour that inevitably comes with talking about sex. “Sex and relationships should be full of joy,” Dale-Jones says. “There are so many things that are so brilliant about all this. Why don’t we talk about them?” Alongside the performance, the team have created a podcast for older audiences, this time with the negative and messy bits included. As well as offcuts from the show – such as a reckoning with ableist language and an operatic song about the clitoris – it includes longer, more in-depth discussions about ideas of queerness, pleasure, friendships, and what they all mean to us as individuals. The Family Sex Show doesn’t pretend to be a lesson telling you everything you need to know, Dale-Jones explains. Instead, it comprises personal stories, movement and song, which serve as confident conversation starters about topics that are too often clumsily handled. “Kids pick up on awkwardness really quickly.” To counter this, the team are working with the School of Sexuality Education, who call their work “unembarrassable”. By encouraging curiosity, Dale-Jones says, they hope to rid these conversations of the associations of shame and fear. Some parents and guardians, she acknowledges, might be anxious about what to expect. “There’s a lot of trust that an audience member has to give you to come and bring their family,” she says. “That’s why the outreach and wraparound activity for the show has been as big a project as the show itself.” Working alongside the organisation Outspoken Sex Ed, as well as the School of Sexuality Education, there’ll be free workshops available for families a few weeks before the shows, with sex educators on hand to answer questions and build confidence. It’s no secret that talking to children about sex, relationships, and their bodies can draw negative attention. When Birmingham’s Parkfield community school attempted to integrate an inclusive programme teaching their students that families can come in all shapes and sizes, including with same-sex parents, protesters picketed the school gates. Incidents like this have been fairly frequent over recent years. “We know we will get people who don’t want it to happen,” Dale-Jones says. “There aren’t many of them, but they shout loudly. The main thing is looking after the company, the venues, their staff and the audiences.” When sex education is boiled down to its core, she says, it’s about “people, and difference, and equality. It all starts with how we look at each other, and how we respect each other.” The need and desire for discussion are far greater than any opposition to it. “If we don’t talk about these things,” she says, “who are we protecting?”  The Family Sex Show is at the Egg, Bath, 28-30 April; Tobacco Factory Theatres, Bristol, 5-8 May; and Norwich & Norfolk festival, 23-27 May.",Arts/Stage,And now for a song about the clitoris!

3/8/2022,"What goes up must come down. Then go back up. Then come down. Then go back up again. That is the law that Fulham seem determined to prove, with Saturday’s peremptory 2-0 win over Blackburn moving them closer to their third promotion from the Championship in five seasons. There is still a way to go, of course, but it looks like they will soon return to the Premier League. Isn’t that exciting? It is OK to say no. It is fair to venture that the more interesting stories in this season’s Championship are to be found almost everywhere else. Such as at Luton Town, who have earned themselves a whiff of the top flight only eight years after clambering out of non-league; or at Middlesbrough, who have not only beaten Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup since Chris Wilder took charge but who moved back into the play-off places on Saturday at the expense of their manager’s old flame, Sheffield United; or indeed at Blackburn, who are to be admired for also being in contention for a play-off spot in a season in which they have suffered the heaviest home defeat in their history, November’s 7-0 humbling by, yes, Fulham. Big deal, right? Fulham were supposed to win the league. Several important players left after their relegation from the Premier League in 2021 but they retained a powerful squad and were tagged as pre-season favourites for promotion. But that does not mean their conquest of the second tier was inevitable. The two clubs who went down with them were also expected to challenge hard: Sheffield United are fighting to get back into the play-off places and West Brom, with internal wrangles, are finding it even tougher. While West Brom’s owner is looking for buyers for the Baggies, Fulham’s owner, Shahid Khan, can start picturing himself watching players such as Mohamed Salah and Jack Grealish in action while he dives into the rooftop swimming pool that is to be part of the Riverside Stand under construction at Craven Cottage. Khan has a similar amenity at his other sports holding, the Jacksonville Jaguars, and people pay thousands of dollars to take a dip while they spectate. So in your face, Tottenham’s notional cheese bar. And up your game, prospective new Chelsea overlords. At this point it is appropriate to wonder whether the Premier League really needs another London club. Or to lament the number of London clubs that the Premier League can sustain compared with the rest of the country. At any rate, Khan, who was interested in buying Wembley in 2018, plans to make money by making a Craven Cottage a go-to venue for much more than football. But the football will be worth watching too. Fulham have got that very right this season. Even if you think their topping the table is par for the course, the style with which they have done it under Marco Silva has been above and beyond anything seen under his predecessor, Scott Parker. Twelve of their victories this season have been by three goals or more. Blackburn were not the only side to be blown away 7-0 on their own pitch – Reading endured a similar ordeal – and Fulham have fired six past Birmingham and Bristol City. With 12 matches left, they have scored more goals than seven of the past 10 winners of the Championship and could end up conceding fewer than any of them. Aleksandar Mitrovic has struck 34 league goals, rifling them in at a rate that has the merit of triggering mention of George Camsell, who holds the record for the highest haul in the second division thanks to his 59 goals for Middlesbrough in the 1926-27 season, a tally he amassed despite abdicating penalty-taking duties out of shame after missing one in a FA Cup tie against lower-league Millwall. Nineteen-year-old Fabio Carvalho has shone in midfield with his wondrous finesse and balance, shape-shifting turns and sharp wit. Harry Wilson’s dinked finish against Blackburn on Saturday was his latest contribution to a fine personal campaign, while Neco Williams showed he has got into the groove since arriving on loan from Liverpool in January by intercepting a Blackburn pass on the edge of his box, scampering forward and trying to chip the goalkeeper from the halfway line, foiled by the crossbar. With Jean Michaël Seri or Nathaniel Chalobah patrolling in front of a defence in which Tosin Adarabioyo has looked classy all season, Fulham have been thrilling to watch. They were seldom that under Parker. Before he took them down from the Premier League last season, he took them up from the Championship, through the play-offs, with several of the players Silva now has. They were tidy and boring. A lot like today’s Bournemouth – now there is a team whose prospective promotion really is not exciting. Parker has been in charge at Bournemouth since leaving Craven Cottage last summer and they have been Fulham’s closest rivals for much of the season. But they were beaten at Preston on Saturday and find themselves third, albeit with matches in hand. They are below Huddersfield, who, under Carlos Corberán, are playing the type of football the club hoped they would see after hiring Marcelo Bielsa’s former assistant. Bielsa’s recent jilting by Leeds is an obvious reminder that what delights in the Championship may not cut it for long in the Premier League without overhauls or adjustments. The fact that Norwich, winners of the Championship in 2019 and 2021, look doomed to finish bottom of the Premier League again also offers a warning of the growing gulf and of how quickly promoted teams need to get everything right. As, of course, does Fulham’s own recent history. Yo-yoing is practically part of the process. Fans of clubs of a certain size just have to hope to be able to enjoy the ride.",Sport/Football,"Goals, style, rooftop pool – but will Fulham stay afloat in Premier League? | Paul Doyle",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/fulham-premier-league-return-rooftop-pool-championship
3/8/2022,"It is not hard to pinpoint the moment that inspired the Football Association’s development manager for diversity and inclusion in the women’s game, Rachel Pavlou, known affectionately in the game as Pav, to lead a life dedicated to women’s football: it was the day her playing career started and ended at the age of seven. “I played in the playground with the boys, like most girls do at primary school, and the maths teacher came out and said: ‘I want you to come to the trials this afternoon. You’re brilliant, come and play,’” she says. “I went to the trials and then my name was on the list of the players that were chosen by the end of the day. But before I even got home, my parents were sent to the headmaster’s office – that was the first and last time I ever went to a headmaster’s or headmistress’s office – to be told that over his dead body would I ever play in his boys’ team, that girls were not to play football and that I should go and play the girls’ sports.” It was a “completely and utterly defining moment”. Pavlou played hockey and tennis competitively but “there was always something missing”. Her first encounter with a women’s team was at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, where she worked after graduating. “There was this women’s football team training and I was shocked, this was 1991,” she says. “I went to watch and they were brilliant. “It happened to be Aston Villa, the team I support, and they invited me to come and play. I was like: ‘Oh my goodness, I can play football.’ I played for the reserves for a few years and I absolutely loved it. Then I got really badly injured and couldn’t come back from it. I just kept going over on my ankles. “In the end, the physio said: ‘If you want to walk when you’re older you need to give up now.’ All I could think was: ‘How unfair is this? I’ve waited all my life to play, I’ve played for a few years, it’s better than I could possibly have ever imagined and I get injured. But I’ve got to keep involved. I can’t walk away again.’” Pavlou did her coaching qualifications instead, while a sports development officer at Solihull College. Once she got her Uefa B licence she joined the first FA-funded course for women and was on it with the current Brighton manager, Hope Powell. A few weeks later, in 1998, both would be offered FA jobs, Powell as head coach of the women’s national team and Pavlou as a regional development manager. The FA has come a long way since. “When I walked in the door, I felt we weren’t welcome,” Pavlou says. “Not just by the Council, which I kind of expected, but by some FA staff as well. I was told numerous times that we were taking money out of men’s football, and people didn’t like that. That lasted for only a handful of years. You could see people changing their mindsets.” It was the arrival of Lady Sue Campbell as head of women’s football, in 2016, that truly brought about change. “Her first question to me was: ‘What is it that we’ve not been allowed to do? What is it that you’ve not found funding for? What do you passionately believe should happen?’ Then she wrote the strategy to make it happen.” One of the things Pavlou told her about was the mini-soccer centre she had piloted for the FA as a volunteer in the 1990s, sessions the former England international Karen Carney and Birmingham general manager Sarah Westwood played in. “I sold Sue on this mini-soccer centre concept, of having an under-11s community programme all across the country and then getting women supported on bursaries to be able to be involved in that and she just loved it. That’s where Wildcats started. Wildcats now is one of our biggest community programmes.” The Wildcats sessions rank in her top three achievements. Another is the introduction of women’s football development officers in the county FAs that began the careers of Bev Priestman (Canada manager), Laura Harvey (OL Reign manager), Mo Marley (consultant for England’s Under-23s) and more. The third is having been involved in the establishment of the Women’s Super League. “How we did that I still look back on and can’t believe,” she says. “We did it in our spare time.” Pavlou is tasked with reversing the effects of professionalism, which has taken talent centres out of inner cities in search of bigger and better facilities and has hindered diversity. A talent identification scheme, Discover My Talent, has also been launched. “You need to tell us you’re that good, we need to see you, hit these criteria, send a video and we will come and find you and help you as an individual,” Pavlou says. “In the last few months of that operating we’ve had nearly 1,000 referrals of girls that we don’t know about … that’s going to make a really big difference to anybody who thinks they’ve been missed.” Pavlou was missed but it became the draw that brought her back to the game. Now she is one of the unsung heroes of women’s football in England.",Sport/Football,Women’s game owes debt of gratitude to unsung hero Rachel Pavlou,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/womens-game-owes-debt-of-gratitude-to-unsung-hero-rachel-pavlou
3/8/2022,"A former senior police officer has told a court it is “ludicrous” to suggest constable Zachary Rolfe should have used his hands to contain Aboriginal man Kumanjayi Walker, who was fatally shot during an arrest in the Northern Territory. It comes as a second juror is discharged in Rolfe’s murder trial in the NT supreme court, meaning both reserve jurors have now been engaged. Former police officer Ben McDevitt told the court on Tuesday that Rolfe had not acted inconsistently with his training in the shooting of Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man who died on 9 November 2019. Rolfe shot Walker three times while trying to arrest him in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs. Walker stabbed Rolfe with a pair of scissors shortly before the first shot was fired. Rolfe is not charged in relation to this shot. He is charged with murder and two alternate charges in relation to the second and third shots. Rolfe has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have argued his actions were justified in light of the risk Walker posed to him and a colleague, the then-constable Adam Eberl. McDevitt, a former Australian federal police assistant commissioner who told the court he was a semi-retired consultant with a 38-year career in police and law enforcement agencies, was called as a witness in Rolfe’s defence. He is expected to be the last witness in the trial, which has just entered its fifth week. David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, asked McDevitt multiple questions about how his opinion of the incident on 9 November 2019 differed from that of Det Sr Sgt Andrew Barram, a senior NT police officer who appeared for the prosecution earlier in the trial. Barram, who held senior positions in relation to the training of NT officers, previously told the court it was reasonable for Rolfe to fire the first shot, as it had occurred while Eberl and Walker were both on their feet and struggling. But Barram said the final two shots were not reasonable, as the situation between Eberl and Walker had changed “substantially”. “They had gone from a standing position in a fairly equal fight, to being on the ground … and constable Eberl pinning Mr Walker down,” he said. On Tuesday, McDevitt described Barram’s evidence as “just an extraordinary assertion”. “It’s a ludicrous proposition,” he told the trial. “It’s patently wrong. It goes against the very training … that apparently Sgt Barram has given to so many officers. “In my view once the struggle went from a standing struggle to the ground it became a far more dangerous and dire situation for constable Eberl.” McDevitt said that training included that an officer was permitted to use their firearm when an offender posed a threat to them or a colleague with an edged weapon. Barram said in his evidence that given the position of Eberl in relation to Walker at the time the second and third shots were fired, Rolfe should have used “open hand” tactics to assist in controlling the offender. McDevitt said: “Again … it’s a ludicrous statement and it’s just not in accordance with the training or the use of force model. I just don’t understand it.” He said the tactical options model on which Barram had based some of his opinions was “heavily influenced” by a model he had developed for the federal police. But he agreed with prosecutor Philip Strickland SC that he had never trained NT police officers nor had any knowledge of policing in remote Aboriginal communities. McDevitt disagreed with Strickland’s suggestion that Rolfe had acted against his training during the shooting, but agreed Rolfe and Eberl had not been “tactically perfect” when they decided to enter the Yuendumu property known as House 511, where the incident occurred. He said having an agreed plan of action before entering House 511 would have been preferable. McDevitt’s evidence continues. Earlier on Tuesday, judge John Burns discharged another jury member in the case. He had been informed that a family member of the juror had contracted Covid-19. Burns said that although the juror had done the right thing and tested negative on multiple rapid antigen tests, the court could not accept the “even small risk” that they could infect other members of the jury. It is the second time a jury member has been discharged in the case, and both reserve jurors have now been used.",News/Australia news,"‘Ludicrous’ to suggest Zachary Rolfe should’ve subdued Kumanjayi Walker with his hands, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/08/ludicrous-to-suggest-zachary-rolfe-shouldve-subdued-kumanjayi-walker-with-his-hands-court-told
3/8/2022,"Immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, Yang, a 22-year-old classical music student in Kyiv, called the Chinese embassy in the city to seek help. He tried several times but the line was engaged. “I don’t know why the embassy didn’t tell us the war was going to break out when other countries advised their citizens to leave days before,” he said. Yang then followed his university’s emergency protocols and took refuge in a bomb shelter. Days later an escape route began to circulate among his friends. He decided to follow the instruction and flee on his own. Almost two weeks before Russia acted – described by the Chinese media as “special military operations” – countries including the UK and Canada advised their nationals to leave Ukraine. But in the case of China, which had nearly 6,000 nationals in the country, it was not until the day after the war broke out that the embassy advised its citizens to leave. “By the time they knew [the war was to break out], it was already too late to evacuate,” said Yun Sun, the director of the China programme at the Stimson Center in Washington. Until the war broke out, many high-profile Chinese pundits and news outlets had insisted western prediction of an invasion was “fake news”. China said on Monday most of its nationals had left Ukraine. At the annual press conference with Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing on the same day, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, told millions of its citizens abroad that the country “is always at your back” in answering a question from the Xinhua news agency. The answer was later widely publicised across Chinese media. Yet, while state media praised the diplomatic mission for its work, its response since the war has also drawn much criticism from some Ukraine-based Chinese students, who spent days trapped in bomb shelters in a war-stricken foreign country. They say the embassy’s slow advice and confusing messaging – including advising them to display a Chinese flag on their vehicles, then a day later telling them “not to display identifying symbols” – contrasted with the image of order and control Beijing had been trying to project over the years. “For a long time, Chinese state agencies as well as state-sponsored media have adopted an opportunistic approach to use every event as an opportunity to advance propaganda goals,” said Ling Li, an expert in Chinese politics and law at the University of Vienna. “This is exactly what happened when the embassy rescinded its previous advice after realising how negatively an expressive pro-Russia position is viewed by the Ukrainians and the international community, which was apparently not considered at all when it hastily issued its first advice.” On Tuesday, a staffer at the embassy told the Guardian to find other means to contact the embassy for a response to this article as his line was for Ukraine-based Chinese nationals only. But asked which department could respond to media inquiries, he said the embassy did not have such a department. In response to criticism last week, a senior official explained in an interview with the Beijing-based Global Times the logistical challenge in withdrawing citizens. Last Tuesday, an anxious Chinese student in Kyiv posted on social media a recording of her desperate call to an embassy staffer, in which she was told to remain sheltered in place or board a train to Lviv by herself. She was trolled by unsympathetic nationalists online before deleting the post. Yang’s escape was not smooth either. At 7am on 1 March, he followed the escape route and ventured out to a Kyiv train station. “The station was clogged with people desperately trying to leave,” he said. “Luckily, I finally got on to a train. On the platform, men saw off their children and wives. It was a scene I had only seen in films. I’ll never forget it.” He said he then spent 10 hours standing in a packed train compartment. En route, he realised he had escaped Kyiv in such a rush that he left his two beloved cellos behind. For the past five years, the instruments had been with him touring around China and Ukraine. His computer was in the bomb shelter too. He carried only a bag with his passport, a few clothes and bank cards. His destination: Lviv in western Ukraine, then Poland. Yang was lucky. On 1 March, a Chinese national was shot and injured while attempting to flee eastern Ukraine, according to state media. A day earlier, a foreign ministry spokesperson said Beijing was “making all feasible plans to help Chinese citizens in Ukraine leave the country”. On its official website and social media account, the embassy began to issue multiple evacuations instructions and open letters – including one that clarifies the ambassador was still in Kyiv to help on the evening of 26 February – after the war broke out. To Luo, 23, another Chinese student who wishes to remain anonymous, the official plan came too late. Having not heard from his embassy for days, Luo jumped on a motorcycle to leave Kyiv with his Iranian classmate as soon as the war broke out on 24 February. They first stopped at a mutual friend’s house in a small village to recharge and figure out a detailed plan after more than 24 hours on the road. Finally, on 28 February, they got to Lviv and found a car to head to Medyka, in south-eastern Poland, bordering Ukraine. But halfway to the Polish border, the traffic jam forced them to abandon the car. “So we decided to go to the border on foot,” Luo said. It was 3pm when they began to walk. They finally arrived at the border at 6am the next day. At the border, they saw two long queues: one for Ukraine nationals – mostly women, children and the elderly; the other for foreigners – mostly Indians and north Africans, Luo said. A day later, on 2 March, Luo and his classmate finally crossed the border, thanks to an announcement by Warsaw two days earlier that allowed Chinese nationals to enter Poland without a Schengen visa. Yang and Luo are safe in Poland after their ordeal. The first two flights carrying evacuees landed in China on Saturday, according to state media. But Luo said he hoped to remain in Poland because tickets to China were “way too expensive”. “I don’t understand. China gives hundreds of millions of dollars to developing countries every year but they don’t financially help their citizens who were forced to escape [to] go back home,” Luo said. “I had never thought this would have happened to me.” Yang, who took a Covid acid test on Sunday as a part of the pre-departure requirement, has sorted out his ticket and is looking forward to heading back home in southern China in the coming days. On Monday morning, he called his 70-year-old cello professor, who decided to stay in Ukraine, to check if he wasall right. “I said goodbye to him. I promised him that when the war is over, I’ll come back to sit in your class again to finish my education.”",News/World news,‘It came too late’: Chinese students who fled Ukraine criticise embassy response,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/chinese-students-fled-ukraine-condemn-embassy-response
3/8/2022,"It’s my first walk after Covid. Here in Scotland, we still have to self-isolate for 10 days, and because I live with a GP husband and a lodger, that meant sticking to a couple of rooms and only sneaking down to the kitchen with mask and disinfectant spray when they were out. I even stopped patting the dog. On my last walk before my positive test, the strath was deep in snow, every tree cloaked in white, the forest silent. Now that I’m out again, the world is transformed. Scraps of snow still linger on the hills, but the valley is clear. Today the sun beams from its pale-blue sky and the cohorts of clouds look too lazy to do very much. Though still only 5C, the air feels fresh and light on my housebound skin. I never lost my sense of smell, so I bask in the fragrances of soil and trees again, of the earth opening. Most of the forest near me is deciduous; the aspens, birches and oaks hold all their new life in tight fists, skeleton limbs stark against the sky. But the birds! The difference in a fortnight is striking, as though they all found their voices when I lost mine. The tracery of branches quivers with them, flitting and bobbing, twittering, calling, piping and singing. Here are all the tits, tiny but insistent, the chaffinches with their downward tumble of notes, the corvids still quarrelling and ruffling feathers, and a lovely mistle thrush, singing its heart out. Doves flute, gulls carry the sea in their cries and a high buzzard pierces the blue. Somewhere, a hidden woodpecker drums along. Down at the marsh, the water’s edge is fringed with delicate ice patterns, suspended in the rushes just above the surface. Beyond, a half-frozen slush melts back to water and further still, two swans are feeding, their long necks slipping down into the dark and rising again in graceful curves. All of it catches the sunlight – the ice and water, the wet grass, the swan feathers – and tosses it back, shining. I am blessed beyond measure to have come through Covid so easily, to be alive and free in a time of troubles, to hear the world sing on a day like this. Praise be.

3/8/2022,"Christine Turner remembers one of the first lynching postcards she ever saw – but it wasn’t the horrific burnt corpse of Will Stanley in Temple, Texas, in 1915 depicted on the front that stayed with her most. It was the chilling note handwritten on the back: “This is the barbecue we had last night,” it reads, ending with the sign-off, “your son, Joe”. “That was the thing that was seared in my mind and that I’ll never forget,” says the Brooklyn-based film-maker. “There was such a casual nature about the postcard. This young man was sharing with his parents something that he took part in that he was proud of. It’s that sense that this is almost a normal activity to partake in that was most disturbing.” Turner’s documentary short Lynching Postcards: Token of a Great Day uncovers a sobering trove of 19th- and 20th-century souvenir postcards commemorating lynchings of African Americans, exposing yet another little-known facet of the vile, ongoing history of racism in America. More than 4,400 racial-terror lynchings occurred in the US between Reconstruction and the second world war, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, and as the film demonstrates, many were staged by white mobs as public events akin to carnivals or picnics. The film, released late last year and shortlisted for this year’s best documentary short Oscar, is a timely one: just last week the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a historic bill that would make lynching a hate crime punishable by up to 30 years in prison. The passage of the bill – named for Emmett Till, the Black 14-year-old who in 1955 was murdered in Mississippi – followed more than a century of stalled attempts. Turner, who began work on the short following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, had come across the postcards first around the release of James Allen’s 1999 book Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America and later while working as an archival researcher on documentaries like Amend, released by Netflix last year. “I’m interested in telling unexpected or lesser- and under-explored stories of the past and the present,” says Turner, who also directed 2013’s Homegoings, an acclaimed feature about African American funeral traditions. “I knew that this would make for a really powerful story and be something a lot of people wouldn’t be familiar with.” Lynching Postcards, in its depiction of violence, treads the delicate line between unflinching and gratuitous, and Turner admits it’s a challenging watch, albeit a necessary one: “It’s not a feelgood movie. The images are so difficult to look at, but in order to understand the present moment, we have to grapple with our history, and we have to confront the ugly parts.” It’s undoubtedly a dark topic, but Turner was determined to also tell a story of Black resistance: Black activists like those at the NAACP used the postcards to mount an awareness campaign showing the horrors of lynching to the world. “I didn’t want to simply make another film about black victimization,” she says firmly. “Anti-lynching activists subverted the postcards’ original intent, transforming and utilizing them as evidence to end the practice of lynching. Those stories of black resistance often get lost in our history.” Photography has long been a powerful tool for exposing injustice, she adds; think of Emmett Till, the images from whose funeral sparked the civil rights movement, up through Eric Garner in more recent times. The process of viewing dozens of harrowing postcards – many drawn from the collections of Atlanta’s National Center for Civil and Human Rights as well as the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture – was no easy task. “I should have probably been meditating or something,” Turner laughs. She relied on discussions with colleagues and friends “that helped remind myself why I was doing it in those challenging, all-consuming moments”. (And as a mother of a two-year-old, she made a point to keep him away from the disturbing images on her desk.) The subject of lynching has received more attention in recent years, with the 2018 opening of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice and Howardena Pindell’s 2020 video Rope/Fire/Water. But Turner declines to say that it’s having a cultural moment: “The question is which people are more receptive to hearing these stories,” she says. “As a result of our national reckoning on race, many people are more open to receiving these histories than they otherwise would have been. But we’ve yet to pass a federal anti-lynching bill, and there is still a huge movement to erase our history altogether with this attack on critical race theory. It’s one step forward, two steps back.” But the film-maker emphasizes the parallels between the story of Lynching Postcards and the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, for example. “There are many what people refer to as modern-day lynchings that may cause some people to take our history of lynching more seriously,” she says. In terms of audience reactions, “a lot of people are horrified by the imagery and completely unfamiliar with the story and say that they can’t believe that this happened,” Turner says. “And they’re referring to not just the postcards but the public-spectacle aspect of so many of these lynchings. We tend to think that these lynchings are more private affairs or spontaneous events where a group of men runs into the woods. These were planned events, with food and concessions. You bring your kids and maybe travel from afar to attend. And that’s surprising to people.” While many Black viewers have told Turner they weren’t aware of these objects, others may know them all too well. “The postcards were mementoes and prideful souvenirs for white people, but they also served as a message, a warning sign, to Black people. They were a proclamation, a way to reinforce white supremacy and keep Black people in their place. So Black people who lived in these communities where lynchings had taken place and where these postcards were created would be well aware of the history.” Ultimately she hopes the film prompts reflection on the country’s history, echoing the film’s final, chilling words taken from the postcard of someone who attended a lynching and asked the recipient’s opinion of it: “I don’t care, do you?” “That was me speaking to the audience,” Turner says. “I’m throwing that question back at viewers.” Lynching Postcards: Token of a Great Day screens for free at Film Forum in New York City on 8 March (followed by a Q&A with the director) and is available to stream on Paramount+",Arts/Film,Lynching Postcards: a harrowing documentary about confronting history,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/08/lynching-postcards-a-harrowing-documentary-about-confronting-history
3/8/2022,"On Wednesday, my therapist set me a task: to record every time I logged on to Twitter, what I posted, and how I felt in the process. This embarrassing piece of homework was in response to an impassioned rant I’d embarked on, during our session. “Everyone just keeps trumpeting their opinions like they know anything,” I said, pausing before admitting that my anger was also drawn from frustration at my own posting behaviour. “Why can’t I stop wading in?” It’s a question I think many will be asking themselves. As Russian tanks began to roll across Ukrainian borders, so too began the real-time reactions. It was to be expected; for the roughly 53 million social media users in the UK, it is hardly unfamiliar in 2022 to see reality filtered through Twitter timelines and Instagram feeds. Despite what some have claimed, the conflict is not even close to being the “first social media war” . But it is the first of this scale on the back doorstep of the west. For many millions in the UK, the war feels closer to home, both in terms of geography and the online spaces they inhabit, a fact disappointingly evidenced by broadcasters drawing oafish comparisons between the shock of combat in “civilised” Europe v conflicts in the “developing world”. This has played out online in an onslaught of opinions and infographics. Surreal moments of well-meaning intervention have occurred, such as popstar Dua Lipa entreating her nearly 80 million Instagram followers to donate to the Ukrainian army. Elsewhere, social media users have held forth on everything from whether nuclear weapons would totally or partly destroy the human race, to the role of astrology in current events. On social media, to be silent is to be found wanting. Despite the different registers of specific platforms (Instagram, for example, is all earnest “awareness”, whereas TikTok is laced with a frenetic, theatre-kid energy), all of them depend on compelling users to actively produce and engage with content. In times of crisis, this demand – baked into code in order to ensure profit for tech bosses – has found itself expressed as a moral obligation. In the case of Ukraine, to visibly engage and express solidarity is viewed as akin to enacting it through practical, tangible action. We are not looking away. We are analysing, boosting and amplifying. We are posting through it. In times of shared distress, people have always coalesced to engage in a collective exercise in sense-making. But the problem is, the online spaces where we gather now are not ones that encourage measured conversations, or the admission that we know little, or maybe nothing at all. Instead, social media platforms are built around the cult of the individual, where knowledge is always delivered in a tone of utmost authority. Counter-knowledge is proffered combatively. The picture in Ukraine doesn’t seem much clearer, but the chatter of social media is a cacophony. People want to be plugged in: this week’s huge jump in viewership for BBC “heavyweight” political offerings such as Newsnight demonstrate that. But many of us have also become conditioned to post our thought processes, analysis and reactions as a stream of consciousness, on platforms where everything – technically – is treated with the same import and weight. Often in these spaces, the overwhelming nature of the information we are bombarded with flattens into a focus on smaller, more accessible details, resulting in pedantic debates about military capacity and so on. There’s a tendency to view the conflict through the lens of our pre-existing disputes (see: bizarre claims about the west’s failure to confront Russia being caused in part because it has been distracted by pronouns). In the cold light of day, all this seems monumentally narrow and grubby. It’s not that these social feeds haven’t resulted in materially useful outcomes. The mobilisation of global Black communities, led by Black British women, not only alerted the general public to horrific racism being faced by Black and Brown students attempting to flee Ukraine, but also provided practical financial support for those who remain trapped. Verified donation schemes have been able to tap into ready-made audiences, primed and eager to help. Slowly, mass outrage at brazen government refusal to aid refugees from the region is chipping away at the Home Office’s determination not to waive visa recommendations. When social media meets specific organisational goals that can be translated into practical action, then we see worthwhile results. Too often, however, that truth is forgotten or pushed aside in the heady rush to post our way out of powerlessness. Isn’t that it? What is happening in Ukraine – as is what is happening in the likes of Palestine and Tigray, and all the regions where conflict rages – exposes our individual helplessness. It is a shock to be reminded of your own personal impotence in the face of geopolitical forces. Turning to the internet, where your voice echoes loudly once more, and a reshare is trumpeted as a quick solution to the distress, is a balm. But it’s a fleeting feeling of catharsis. Closing Twitter after a long day of sharing opinions leaves me spent, and often angry, but no closer to feeling as if I’ve made any real difference. The solution is, of course, one that’s existed for aeons: engage in the unshowy, sustainable work of collective organising. Pulling together donations for refugees. Fundraising. Mounting further pressure on the Home Office to immediately waive visa requirements. None of that precludes posting on social media, especially if you really do know what you’re talking about. But I’m not convinced that many of us do, to be honest. It’s a lesson in humility and forgoing the short-lived fix. I think the annals of history can survive this round without my take.

3/8/2022,"The juror in Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial who apparently did not disclose childhood sexual abuse during jury selection is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday morning for public questioning. Juror no 50, whose name is Scotty David, might receive immunity, which would require that he answer Judge Alison Nathan’s questions about his failure to disclose said abuse. Maxwell was convicted on 29 December of sex-trafficking and related charges for procuring girls – some aged just 14 – for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse. Maxwell has maintained her innocence. Epstein, a convicted sex offender who once counted global elites such as Britain’s Prince Andrew among his associates, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking. He killed himself in a New York City federal jail about one month after his arrest. Maxwell’s conviction was thrown into potential disarray days after her trial concluded. David claimed in post-trial media interviews that he had been sexually abused as a child and said that he told other jurors about this abuse, which helped them see things from a victim’s perspective. David’s comments prompted controversy as potential jurors completed questionnaires during the screening process, which directly asked about past abuse. One questions stated: “Have you or a friend ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” Following David’s comments in the media, prosecutors asked Nathan for an inquiry into his statements. Maxwell’s lawyers quickly joined in asking for such an inquiry and have since been pushing for a mistrial, arguing that David’s failure to disclose past abuse deprived her of a fair, impartial jury. David’s completed questionnaire was released during legal exchanges on this controversy. The document revealed that he had marked the no box in response to the abuse query. While it is unlikely that Maxwell will be retried, the fact remains that it is a possibility. Veteran attorneys told the Guardian that would hinge on David’s explanation for his failure to disclose.

3/8/2022,"Iread this book, which is a thoughtful critique but ultimately a stalwart defence of liberalism, as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, and it felt urgent and timely. Vladimir Putin, as Francis Fukuyama reminds us, has declared liberal democracy “obsolete”. His is not an uncommon opinion, even in liberal democracies. Thirty years ago, following the inglorious collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, Fukuyama gained international recognition for his book entitled The End of History and the Last Man. It argued that liberal democracy was essentially “the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution”. As events such as 9/11, the Afghan and Iraq wars and the 2008 financial crisis took their toll on liberalism’s self-confidence, Fukuyama’s work was denounced as the height of Hegelian hubris. He was seen as a naive believer in the inevitability of a western-defined idea of progress, and as someone who was blind to liberal democracy’s failings. In some respects, the criticisms were unfair, or at least aimed at arguments he never made. But there seems little doubt that Fukuyama has had to eat rather a lot of humble pie. As he writes: “It’s clear liberalism has been in retreat in recent years.”In that time, Fukuyama has backed away from the American neoconservative agenda that he had initially supported, and has watched as authoritarian leaders such as Putin, China’s Xi and Turkey’s Erdoğan laid claim to the world stage. He cites sobering statistics that political rights and civil liberties have been falling for the past 15 years around the world, having risen for the previous three and a half decades. On top of all that, rightwing populists and leftwing progressives have made significant inroads into western politics. Following Donald Trump’s attack on democracy, and Britain’s rejection of European-style liberalism, the US and UK still adhere to liberal democracy, but it’s not exactly a political and economic system in which its beneficiaries feel much pride. The first difficulty when it comes to rousing the liberal spirit is that liberalism is famously difficult to define. It has become one of those words that mean different things to different political groupings. A vital strength of this slim, elegant book is that it is crystalline in its definitions, even while acknowledging the complexities of practice. Although liberalism is under attack from both left and right, it is from the left that the more serious intellectual challenge comes. Fukuyama recognises this fact and attempts to address the left’s criticism. Essentially a system that is founded on the principle of equality of individual rights, law and freedom has evolved rather conspicuous inequalities in each of those realms. The most glaring are the economic inequalities that have grown in the west, particularly in the US and UK, over the past 40 years. Fukuyama attributes these to “neoliberalism”, the belief in unfettered markets as the means of delivering the goal of consumer welfare. But, Fukuyama contends, this is a distortion of liberalism, which has a much larger social remit than simply economic efficiency. It’s not just a question of regulating and limiting big business – although Fukuyama argues for both – but of appreciating the social capital that attains from redistribution and narrowing of inequalities. At times the former adviser to the Reagan administration can sound like a Scandinavian social democrat. Almost. Nonetheless the postmodern left maintain that inequalities and injustice are not a malfunction of liberalism but instead a manifestation of structural power built in at a foundational level. His exegesis of critical theory from Marcuse through to Foucault, and how it has been widely adopted as a tool of sociopolitical analysis, is a brilliantly acute summary of the way some aspects of liberal thought have consumed themselves. The pursuit of individual autonomy or “self-actualisation”, for example, has become mired in an identity politics that subsumes the individual into rigidly defined groupings based on ethnicity, gender or sexuality. In a way, argues Fukuyama, this is a necessary step to address structural inequalities and counteract the misplaced notion that the individual is the only unit of social importance. Taken to its extreme, however, this kind of analysis offers no liberation, but the revelation of ever deeper layers of oppression, in which individual thought is an illusion, and all intellectual interaction is subject to the power dynamics of group hierarchies. Everything, by way of this understanding, including empirical science, becomes a social construct designed to benefit the powerful. As Fukuyama notes, it’s a form of conspiratorial thinking that has been duly adopted by the right, who saw measures enacted during the pandemic – mask wearing, vaccination and social-distancing – as signs of a hidden power elite. Although he outlines some familiar complaints about social media monopolies and their baleful effect on political discourse, the overall sense you gain from this book is that liberalism is in crisis because of the complacency that set in with its successes. Liberal democracy has delivered on many fronts, but with each step forward it left many constituencies behind. Its opponents like to speak of the “Tina” – there is no alternative – way of thinking as a liberal democratic shibboleth that must be exposed. And so it must. There are alternatives – as the likes of Putin, Xi and their imitators conspicuously demonstrate. They’re just not good ones. However, liberalism cannot afford to rely on the flaws of its antagonists. It needs to refresh, re-evaluate and rethink. This book does not supply all, or enough, of the answers. But it’s a good place to start with asking the essential questions.  Liberalism and Its Discontents by Francis Fukuyama is published by Profile (£16.99).

3/8/2022,"It’s International Women’s Day, so of course I find myself reflecting not on the plight of women, but on what I was up to on all previous IWDs. In the 90s, we celebrated it in pubs, because whether or not real women drank pints was one of feminism’s critical questions back then. I’m not kidding. It’s not even a stupid question – but we can talk about why not some other time. Most of the 00s was lost to arguing on social media about why there wasn’t an International Men’s Day (ignoring the boring reality that it’s on 19 November), or whether that was every other day of the year. Then, on what has lodged in my memory as aeons before the pandemic, but was actually the blink of an eye ahead of the first lockdown, I went to Berlin for a panel discussion about what a feminist Europe would look like. The question made me miserable. We had been wading through the toxic sludge of Brexit for nearly four years, and we had just elected a government of rightwing shysters. Even if we did come up with a blueprint for an international feminist utopia, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage would between them probably find a way to yank the UK out of it. Plus, you almost never see a new idea spawned during a panel discussion in real time. You would be more likely to see a scientific breakthrough on Ready Steady Cook. That was my prejudice; turned out that was just because most panels don’t contain enough feminists. So anyway, I can’t remember whose idea this was, between Saboura Naqshband, an academic and co-founder of the Berlin Muslim Feminists Collective, Daphne Büllesbach, vice-president of European Alternatives Berlin, or Prune Antoine, editor-in-chief of Sisters of Europe. All I can say for certain is that it wasn’t my idea. I’d arrived with nothing in my head besides goodwill and the aforesaid misery. It sounds pretty simple in retrospect. There were four basic questions. What were the origins of the women’s movement? Universal suffrage. What was its international evolution? As women’s voting rights were established, it became a Peace, Land and Bread movement, and still has the campaign against poverty and conflict at its core. What are the pressing issues now? Still poverty and conflict, the displacements they both cause, plus the democratic deficits that land us with the authoritarian governments that create them. How could we loop all that together? With a new suffrage movement for the 21st century, except not for women – many of us, I can’t help but notice, already have voting rights – but for migrants. Everyone had an example of the transformative impact it would have in various elections, if migrants were granted the vote. The Munich mayorals were just around the corner, there was something afoot in Barcelona … I wasn’t really listening because, yet again, I’d disappeared down the rabbit hole of our own referendum. What would have happened if the three 3 million EU migrants living in the UK had been able to vote in 2016? We wouldn’t be in this mess. What would happen to immigration policy – indeed, the very language around migration – if immigrants were recast as people whose votes you wanted? It might be humane. What would have happened in the 2019 general election if the long-term UK residents whose lives were about to be upended by some blowhard promising to “get Brexit done” had had a say in the matter? He wouldn’t now be prime minister. But these sad counterfactuals weren’t really the point. It’s just morals, innit? There isn’t really a defensible civic agenda in which some people’s voices are, in perpetuity, more important than others’. Feminism was mobilised in the crucible of this understanding; if your destination is equality and justice, your route is democracy, as much of it as you can lay your hands on. You’ll notice something counterintuitive about the plan, I’m sure. The idea wasn’t “votes for migrant women” but “votes for all migrants”. The logical endpoint for International Women’s Day would be a unisex campaign, which I do realise will bug the hell out of some people. Happy International Women’s Day!

3/8/2022,"One squally day or stormy night about 1,700 years ago, a boat carrying hundreds of amphorae of wine, olives, oil and garum – the fermented fish sauce that so delighted the ancient palate – came to grief during a stopover in Mallorca. The merchant vessel, probably at anchor in the Bay of Palma while en route from south-west Spain to Italy, was quickly swallowed by the waves and buried in the sands of the shallow seabed. Until last month, its miraculously preserved treasures had lain untouched, despite sitting just 2 metres beneath the bellies of the countless tourists who swim off one of the busiest beaches in the Balearics. Now, however, the boat – known as the Ses Fontanelles wreck – is giving up its archaeological, historical and gastronomic secrets. A recovery operation overseen by the island’s governing body, the Consell de Mallorca, and involving experts from three Spanish universities in the Balearics, Barcelona and Cádiz, has retrieved about 300 amphorae as well as other objects that offer priceless insights into the Mediterranean of the fourth century AD and the crew’s daily lives. In addition to the clay jars – which still bear their painted inscriptions or tituli picti – archaeologists have found a leather shoe, a rope shoe, a cooking pot, an oil lamp and only the fourth Roman carpenter’s drill recovered from the region. The boat, which is 12 metres long and between 5 and 6 metres wide, emerged three years ago after a summer storm churned up the waters of the bay. Its appearance confirmed anecdotal reports from divers dating back to the 1950s, and prompted the Consell de Mallorca to take action. After running an emergency intervention, the consell put together a team of archaeologists and marine experts to undertake the three-year Arqueomallornauta project. “The aim is to preserve everything there and all the information it contains, and that couldn’t be done in a single emergency intervention,” says Jaume Cardell, the consell’s head of archaeology. “That’s where the project Arqueomallornauta comes in: it’s about recovering and preserving both the wreck and its historical cargo. This isn’t just about Mallorca; in the whole western Mediterranean, there are very few wrecks with such a singular cargo.” Although the team is now looking at how best to recover the hull of the wreck, which lies just 50 metres off the beach, those who brought up the cargo in an operation that ran from November 2021 to mid-February are still a little breathless over what they have found. None of the team had expected the sands of the bay to have done such a spectacular job of sealing the wreck off from oxygen and preserving its organic materials. “Things have been so perfectly preserved that we have found bits of textile, a leather shoe and an espadrille,” says Dr Miguel Ángel Cau, an archaeologist at the University of Barcelona. “The most surprising thing about the boat is just how well preserved it is – even the wood of the hull … It’s wood that you can knock – like it’s from yesterday.” The team, who established that the boat set sail from Spain’s Cartagena region by analysing the minerals in the amphorae’s clay, say it is hard to overstate the significance of the find. “It’s important in terms of naval architecture because there are very few ancient boats that are as well preserved as this one,” says Dr Darío Bernal-Casasola, an archaeologist at the University of Cádiz. “There are no complete Roman boats in Spain.” What’s more, he adds, the amphorae represent an improbable subaquatic archaeological hat-trick: “It’s incredibly difficult – almost impossible – to find whole amphorae that bear inscriptions, and also still have the remains of their contents. The state of conservation here is just amazing. And you have got all this in just 2 metres of water where millions of people have swum.” For Enrique García Riaza, a historian at the University of the Balearic Islands, the wreck highlights the commercial and strategic importance of the Balearic archipelago during the Roman empire. “The islands weren’t cut off – on the contrary, they were a fundamental staging post on routes from the Iberian peninsula and the Italic peninsula,” he says. “In Roman times, the cities of the Balearic archipelago had political elites who were also very well connected to the main Roman cities of the Mediterranean coast, such as Cartagena and Tarragona.” The team has found no trace of the boat’s crew apart from their belongings, suggesting perhaps they made it to the shore or were swept away from the wreck by the waves. What they left behind, however, is intriguing. Cau points to the oil lamp, which bears an obviously pagan symbol of the moon goddess Diana, and to the Christian signs that appear on the seals of some of the amphorae. “The crew were probably pagan, but some of the merchandise they were carrying has Christian symbols,” he says. “You have to be careful about how you interpret that – that cargo could have been from an ecclesiastical authority – but you have that coexistence between the pagan and the Christian. “That may tell us a bit about the daily lives for the crew. They might have said, ‘Look, I’m a sailor and I believe what I believe, but if you want me to carry a Christian cargo, I’m OK with that if the money’s good.’” With the recovery phase complete and the cataloguing under way, thoughts are now turning to putting the entire find on show. “The idea is to recover the hull, and we are in touch with both national and international experts to make sure it’s properly recovered,” says Cardell. “The boat needs to be exhibited and people need to see it. At the end of the day, we do archaeology for everyone and not just for the scientists.” A few weeks after the wreck’s cargo was touched by human hands for the first time in almost two millennia, the archaeologists remain buoyant. “This is one of those finds when you are just laughing all the time because you can’t believe it,” says Cau. “This is the sort of thing that happens to you once in an academic lifetime. We will never find anything like this again and that’s what makes it so special.”",News/Science,"Roman boat that sank in Mediterranean 1,700 years ago gives up its treasures",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/08/roman-boat-that-sank-in-mediterranean-1700-years-ago-gives-up-its-treasures

3/8/2022,"Sergey Korenev was running out of time. He watched his daughter Anna, 11, practice skateboarding in a park on a rainy Thursday night outside Portland, Oregon. His midnight flight will board in a few hours that will begin a long journey to the war in Ukraine. Sergey still has to pack, but he doesn’t hurry her. Sergey, 44, has been bringing Anna here to the park for a month and each time she gets better. He watched her roll down a small hill towards him. “Come on, come on, come on …” Sergey said in Russian, smiling at the progress she’s making. Sergey’s eldest daughter Maria, 17, was standing next to him with her hoodie pulled up. She doesn’t look at her phone, even when Anna walks back up the hill and it turn quiet between her and her father. Sergey’s mother is alone in her home outside Kyiv, hiding from shelling. Sergey wants to go home to rescue her, take her to Poland and then stay and fight. Since the start of the Russian build up Sergey has been fixated on news, worried. On the night of the invasion Valentina Korenev, his ex-wife, texted him. He had already made his decision: he was going back to Ukraine. “I’ve been monitoring the situation since last fall, like everybody,” Sergey said through a translator, his brother Alex Korenev. “But when it became a total invasion, I felt like I needed to do something. I could not watch it from afar.” Sergey is one of about 66,000 Ukrainians returning home to help fight the Russian invasion following President Volodymyr’s Zelenskiy’s call for s Ukrainians abroad return to the homeland to fight the Russias. Korenev, whose family is Jewish, is one Ukrainian in the US answering the call. Later that Thursday night in his apartment in Vancouver, Washington, Sergey laid his gear on a sofa. Laptop, headphones, gloves, new boots he still has to break in, a bag of insulin for his type 2 diabetes. He’s trying to get familiar with where all the pockets are in his new military-style backpack. He doesn’t carry much, but he takes care of what he does have. His Ukrainian passport isn’t bent or worn. Only the stamps inside it give away how much it’s seen. He folds a scarf of Dynamo Kyiv soccer club into his bag. He opens a pouch with keys to his mothers home in Kyiv, checking to see if they are still there. He zips up the pouch and places it in his bag. “A lot of my friends are volunteers, in the territorial defense force. I can help them, because I know them, I told them I can bring what you need when you need it. So I’ve gotten a list of supplies of what they need,” he said. Sergey sticks a small Ukrainian flag on the outside of the backpack. On a shelf obscured by a small television is a framed award, that he’s not packing, from the Ukrainian special forces recognizing him for his work with veterans. “He is a huge patriot of Ukraine,” said his brother Alex, who has lived in Vancouver, Washington, for 11 years. “He’s going there because he feels that he’s country is under assault and wants to help his brothers in arms.” Alex said his brother felt the need to help in some way after he saw his friends killed in the Maiden revolution in 2013. When fighting broke out in the eastern region of Donetsk in 2014, Sergey and Valentina, an interior designer, started a foundation to help those fighting. They lobbied companies to donate construction materials that they could use to fix apartments. If a father or a son was killed in action, leaving behind a family with a roof to replace and plumbing to fix, they would do it for free. If a veteran returned from the war without meaning and purpose, with just a hammer or a paint brush, Sergey and Valentina would find them one. They even helped the nascent Ukrainian military, as at the time a special forces unit was relocated to a barracks with bare walls. “They made it livable with windows, doors, put floor in, paint it, and put some chairs and furniture,” said Alex. But, by immigrating to the US, he and Valentina had been trying to give their daughters a shot at a better life, at more opportunity. “They wanted to try a better life, they have two young daughters and they thought it’s gonna be good for them to grow here and get good education,” said Alex. “They just won the lottery green card, if you win the lottery you use it.” Sergey has been embracing life in America’s Pacific north-west. “He’s been exploring the craft beer landscape, he’s been buying every time something new, a couple of cans and making photos and archiving it all,” said Alex. Sergey speaks Russian at home and is still learning English. He’s taken gig economy jobs that let him work while still learning the language, driving for Uber and Doordash. “Since he’s been doing DoorDash he’s been exposed to a lot of different cuisine. For example, he’s been taking Mediterranean stuff home, Chick-fil-A and a lot of pizza,” Alex said. Korenev is leaving home tonight on a mission with three objectives. First he’s taking $9,000 in donations from Ukrainian community in Oregon. He’s flying to New York on to pick up some more donations from friends in the Ukrainian community there. Then he’s flying to Warsaw, Poland, to cross the border over land. His second objective is to get to Kyiv as fast as possible to find his mother and get her to safety. He hopes to get her out of the country. His final objective is to help win a war. “I’m going there to help my friends, they are my brothers in arms,” Sergey said. One of his final acts with his family was to drop off his Mercedes SUV at his ex-wife’s home and to say goodbye. Valentina had a gift waiting for him: a new pair of boots. He was surprised. He tried them on and then went to his bag and gave Maria the receipt for his other pair, with instructions to return them and keep the money. His ex-wife is scared for him but supports his decision. “I think it’s the right thing to do,” Valentina said. “I and our children are very worried, of course, but Ii agreed to help in any way I can. If I need to come, I will come to Ukraine. But for now, I can do more good from here.” Near midnight, at Portland international airport, Sergey walks with his daughters and brother towards security. He takes out the dollars in his wallet and hands them to Anna to keep. He sets his bag down and picks Anna up, holding her in the air. A couple try to get past Sergey’s group and stop. One of them points to the Ukrainian flag sticking out of his bag, aware of what’s happening, and they both back away for a moment to watch Sergey say goodbye to his family. Maria holds her younger sister, after their father has left, letting her cry in her arms. When asked about how she feels about her dad leaving to join the war effort, Maria has a simple answer: “Scared? No, I’m proud.”",News/US news,‘I can help them’: one man’s journey from Portland to Ukraine’s frontlines,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/portland-to-ukraine-frontlines-russia-invasion
3/8/2022,"Where do women in the UK find themselves on International Women’s Day in 2022? In truth: more fearful about their safety, more anxious about their economic futures and wondering if the monumental gains made in gender equality over the last decades are at risk. But they are also louder and more determined than ever. It is impossible to reflect on the last 12 months without focusing on the seismic revolution of understanding of male violence against women and girls (VAWG). Research from Rosa, a grant-making charity for frontline women’s organisations, reveals that 89% of the 320 organisations they surveyed think public understanding of the problem has transformed since the murder of Sarah Everard one year ago. The past year has also seen a rupturing of the trust between women and the state agencies that pledge to protect them. At a vigil to honour Everard in Clapham Common, which police had tried and failed to prevent by threatening to heavily fine organisers, women who had come to mourn were instead forcibly removed. What trust was left took a further blow with the prosecution of two officers who shared pictures of the murdered sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, the exposure of vile sexist and racist Whatapp messages shared between officers based at London’s Charing Cross police station, and ongoing reports of officers accused of domestic abuse going unpunished, or worse uninvestigated. Speaking to the Guardian on Monday, the new national police lead on VAWG, Maggie Blyth, promised change – a prioritisation of crimes against women and a crackdown on men within the ranks of the police who abuse their power. There is a moment of opportunity, she insisted, and it is too important to waste. There is hope. At the grassroots level, councils like Greenwich, where Sabina Nessa was murdered, are helping fund plays about sexism and toxic masculinity, local youth rugby clubs are asking how they can help prevent violence against women, an outpouring of grief after the murder of Everard raised more than half a million pounds that will be distributed to small charities working at the vanguard of tackling misogyny and male violence. On the national stage, the UK government and the mayors of London and Manchester have launched a communications campaign focusing on stopping perpetrators of sexual harassment and violence. The government, the National Police Chiefs’ Council and the College of Policing have agreed to implement all the recommendations made by a damning inspection by the policing watchdog, leading to Blyth’s appointment and the upgrading of VAWG to the same strategic footing as terrorism. The challenge now will be keeping the issue in the spotlight as the horror at what happened to Everard – exposed in the trial of her killer Wayne Couzens – moves further into the past. More than a 125 women have died since International Women’s Day last year, according to the Femicide Census, which notes that a woman is killed by a man every three days. The work of ending men’s violence towards women and girls will be arduous and painstaking. It is – as many who have worked in the sector for decades can attest – the work of a lifetime. But, for now at least, the wail of anger and anguish that crescendoed after the murder of Everard continues to echo through society. Women have found their voice, and they are determined to be heard.",News/World news,Women still fear for their safety but are louder and more determined than ever,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/women-still-fear-for-their-safety-but-are-louder-and-more-determined-than-ever
3/8/2022,"Last summer, Katelyn Samples posted a picture of her youngest son, Locklan Samples, to Instagram. Then a stranger sent her a message. It asked if her then 10-month-old son had been diagnosed with uncombable hair syndrome. The 33-year-old mother from Roswell, Georgia, was worried. “At first, you see ‘syndrome’ and you’re like, ‘Oh my gosh,’ like, is something wrong with my baby? Is he in pain or something?” she told ABC’s Good Morning America. Samples began searching on Google and called her paediatrician. The doctor told her they had never heard of the syndrome, but referred her to a paediatric dermatologist at Emory Healthcare, in Atlanta. There, Locklan was diagnosed with uncombable hair syndrome, or UHS. A rare genetic disorder of the hair shaft, UHS is characterised by disorderly silvery-blond or straw-colored hair. The hair, which stands out from the scalp, cannot be combed flat. The syndrome commonly shows up in children between three and 12. “When you look under the microscope, you can see that instead of having hairs that are cylinder shape … the shaft of the hair is actually more in a triangular shape,” Dr Carol Cheng, a paediatric dermatologist at UCLA Health, told ABC. “Within the triangle, there [are] these little grooves that go up and down the long axis of the hair shaft, so that’s why it makes it really uncombable.” Scientists know of only about 100 cases and according to the National Institutes of Health there is currently no definitive treatment. However, the condition typically improves or resolves itself once puberty begins. Samples said her son’s hair has a “crimp” in it, adding: “It can get matted easily. It is very fragile … It can get tangled and I do have to be careful. That would be an example of a time I actually would wash it because I very rarely wash his hair. Just doesn’t need to be. It doesn’t really get greasy.” In her initial research, Samples noticed that information was scarce. However, she soon found a Facebook group created solely for those with experience of UHS. The group exchanges information on hairstyles, products and care. “That has been extremely helpful … it’s been comforting,” Samples told the Washington Post. The only possible symptom Locklan has been experiencing is “extremely sensitive skin”, Samples said, adding that other parents in the Facebook group noticed this in their kids. Sometimes, she said, children with UHS can overheat. After Locklan’s diagnosis, Samples followed her husband’s advice and launched @uncombable_locks, an Instagram account featuring pictures of Locklan and his hair. Seven months later, users have thrown their support behind Locklan. One wrote: “I love him so much!!! I would love to see all the other kids in a pic together that have UHS.” Another user wrote: “Loving his fuzz top and mullet in the back. Shall we just say he’s rocker chic?” Samples describes the attention as “filled with joy and extremely kind”. People sometimes ask to take pictures with Locklan, she said, adding that she does not mind “as long as the baby is happy and vibing with it”.",News/US news,US boy with uncombable hair syndrome becomes Instagram hit,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/uncombable-hair-syndrom-instagram-locklan-samples
3/8/2022,"For many women and girls, the ability to buy a sports bra is taken for granted. The very concept of feeling discomfort while exercising is alien to a lot of us, who have the money needed to buy one and time to have it correctly fitted. In the age of active wear, some even have a few. But for many other young women, a sports bra is a luxury they cannot afford on top of basic living expenses. The result is often that they simply do not play sport. In 2018, New Yorker Sarah Dwyer-Shick sought to change this, starting The Sports Bra Project to facilitate the donation of new sports bras from companies and individuals to give to those facing barriers to participation which can, on the surface, be remedied. The American project has so far channelled more than 7,000 donated bras to 55 organisations across 26 countries. Now it is coming to Australia, after Women Sport Australia on Tuesday announced it has partnered with The Sports Bra Project to source local bras it can provide to local communities, particularly remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory and also those affected by the floods in Queensland and New South Wales. “A sports bra is obviously a piece of equipment that is unique to girls and women, and if you don’t have the right support there you’re not going to want to play sport,” said Women Sport Australia president Gen Dohrmann, who is also chief executive of Table Tennis Victoria and a dance teacher. “I work in different sports in Melbourne and everyone has access to sports bras, but I think there’s definitely lots of remote communities around Australia where that definitely wouldn’t be the case. “It’s targeting those women and girls who aren’t already playing sport because they have to spend their pay cheque on food and shelter and bills. “To be able to bring some of this initiative where people are donating new sports bras to be able to get out to remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory and potentially at the moment those affected by floods. That’s where we’ll be concentrating our efforts.” The process operates via the website, where individuals and companies can donate independently or as part of an organised drive, and where individuals, communities and sporting clubs can register to become a recipient. Dohrmann said Women Sport Australia then conduct due diligence to ensure resources are distributed where they are most needed. The initiative has already been tested at local fundraisers and talks are under way with bra manufacturers, including Under Armour, who may donate some of its unused stock to the cause. Another is Brava Lingerie which specialises in plus-sized busts ranging from D to K cup sizes. “We want to make sure we’re not just getting 10B bras donated,” Dohrmann said. “We ask people to donate the size of bra that you wear so we get a real range of sizes.” The project is also set to receive some of the bras produced for the Australian athletes who competed at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Among the supporters is Australian Paralympic gold medallist, Madison de Rozario. “The Sports Bra Project is such a practical way to give support to women and girls who want to participate in sport but can’t always get access to the right gear,” she said. “We know that physical activity plays a significant role in improving health, building stronger communities and giving people a purpose.” Inspiration for the original Sports Bra Project began in Africa, where Dwyer-Shick, a long-time football coach with expertise in youth development and increasing access to sports for girls and women, gifted sports bras to young players in rural Namibia. She discovered that many members of the Namibian National Women’s football team had never owned this basic piece of equipment, and that the problem was not requested to this one country. Dohrmann said sport should not be considered a luxury for any young woman. “We just want to make sure if they can feel more confident in getting out for a run or going down to the local playground and doing some exercises or the local basketball court,” she said. “If they actually have a sports bra that’s going to open up a door for them.”",Sport/Sport,Not a luxury: campaign launched to provide sports bras and remove participation barriers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/08/not-a-luxury-campaign-launched-to-provide-sports-bras-and-remove-participation-barriers
3/8/2022,"Sri Lanka is in mourning after the death of the country’s most sacred elephant, who is to be given a state funeral and his remains to be preserved and stuffed “for future generations” on orders of the president. Nadungamuwa Vijaya Raja, popularly known as Raja, was considered to be the largest tamed elephant in Asia and as a young calf he had been among those “chosen” as the elite elephants who carried sacred Buddhist relics during an annual parade in Sri Lanka. After news of his death aged 68, hundreds of mourners travelled to see his body at his residence on the outskirts of Colombo, which was covered in a white shroud and adorned with flowers. Born in the Indian city of Mysore in 1953, according to folklore, Raja was one of two elephant calves gifted by the king of Mysore to a Sri Lankan physician monk to thank him for curing one of king’s relatives of an illness. For over a decade, Raja’s sacred role had been to carry the casket containing the holy tooth relic of lord Buddha during the annual procession of Esala, an important religious pageant for the country’s Buddhist majority which takes place in July during the full moon in the city of Kandy. According to tradition, only certain elephants with very specific physical traits can be selected for this holy role. They have to be have a flat back, specially curved tusks and when they stand all seven points of the elephant– their four legs, trunk, penis and tail – must all touch the ground. Raja was considered so important that when he travelled he had his own security detail, and a military unit was deployed when he made his annual 90km walk from his residence to the city of Kandy, where the Temple of the Sacred Tooth relic is located and the religious procession takes place. President Gotabaya Rajapksa declared Raja to be a “national treasure” and said that after the Buddhist last rites had been performed on the elephant, his cadaver would be handed over to taxidermists who would stuff it for posterity. He will be given full state honours for his funeral. He would not be the first sacred elephant to be given such treatment in death. His predecessor, also known as Raja, was also stuffed and preserved after he died aged 75 and now sits within his own museum in the Temple of the Sacred Tooth relic in Sri Lanka.",News/World news,Sri Lanka to hold state funeral for beloved sacred elephant Raja,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/sri-lanka-to-hold-state-funeral-for-beloved-sacred-elephant-raja
3/8/2022,"Hello, it is Tuesday morning and time for the briefing with me, Warren Murray. Millions of people are on the move across Ukraine in Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. And it is only just beginning, writes Luke Harding from alongside a vast caravan of vehicles waiting to get into Poland, where a million have already arrived. “Putin’s soldiers are killing civilians and shelling cities. They destroy everything. Look at Mariupol,” says Lena, travelling in a three-car family convoy. “We heard the explosions. Seven of them. It was terrible,” she said. The number of Ukrainian refugees granted visas to come to the UK under the new family scheme has risen from about 50 to 300, the government has announced, leading Labour to criticise the “shockingly low” figure. On the battlefront inside Ukraine it is being reported that a senior Russian officer, Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of the 41st army, has been killed outside Kharkiv, along with other senior officers, in a significant blow to Russian morale. Ukrainian military intelligence released what it said was a conversation between two Russian FSB officers discussing Gerasimov’s death. The investigative agency Bellingcat said the call was intercepted partly because the Russians’ secure communications had failed, forcing them to use normal mobile phones. Overnight, Moscow has stoked fears of an energy war by threatening to close Nord Stream 1, the major gas pipeline to Germany, after the US pushed its European allies to consider banning Russian oil imports. On Russian state TV, deputy PM Alexander Novak said that since Germany had halted certification of the new Nord Stream 2 joint venture, “we have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has meanwhile made an impassioned address vowing to stay in Ukraine until the war is won. Zelenskiy is due to speak to British MPs by video link today. His government rejected an offer from Moscow to create “humanitarian corridors” for civilians after it emerged that most of the supposedly safe routes led directly to Russia or Belarus. Coverage of Vladimir Putin’s catastrophic war on Ukraine continues at our live blog. ‘Halt this tax rise’ – Labour will today spring a snap vote on cancelling the increase in national insurance contributions (NICs), warning it will cost the average private sector worker £410 a year. It comes after the Office for Budget Responsibility found that in addition to the NICs rise directly levied on employees, 80% of the equivalent increase in employers’ contributions would be “passed through to workers via lower nominal wages”. There is also growing unease among Tories amid the cost of living crisis: Jacob Rees-Mogg is one of the Conservatives who have called for the rise to be delayed. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “The Conservatives are trapping us in a high-tax, low-growth cycle. They must get behind Labour’s motion tomorrow and halt this tax rise before it’s too late.” ‘Economic warfare bill’ – Oligarchs or kleptocrats who try to sell off property in order to avoid it being listed in a new public register may be forced to declare their details upon sale, after ministers promised to toughen up the economic crime bill which was rushed through the Commons on Monday in response to Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. It targets criminals and those – such as Russian oligarchs – who might be seeking to shelter illicitly acquired money, particularly through property purchases. The former cabinet minister David Davis said it was not a “perfectly crafted bill” and was initially designed for a different purpose but had become an “economic warfare bill – a war that liberal democracies cannot afford to lose”. Female artists show their faces – The National Portrait Gallery has acquired five self-portraits by female artists as part of a three-year project to enhance its representation of women. The gallery, which is closed for refurbishment, said the works highlighted stories of women who have helped shape British culture. They include the first painted self-portrait by a black female artist in the gallery’s collection. Everlyn Nicodemus’s Självporträtt, Åkersberga layers multiple faces in recognition of her roles as artist, writer, mother and wife. Rose Finn-Kelcey’s self-portrait, Preparatory Study for “Divided Self”, shows two images of herself engaging in conversation while sitting on a bench at Speaker’s Corner in London’s Hyde Park. Also represented are Chila Kumari Burman, Celia Paul and Susan Hillier. The acquisitions are part of a three-year project in partnership with the Chanel Culture Fund. Call for radical police overhaul – Police officers would need to hold and renew a “licence to practice” every five years and be subject to strict conditions under proposals to boost confidence in policing. An independent review chaired by Sir Michael Barber and carried out by the Police Foundation thinktank contains 56 recommendations for radical reform. There should also be national targets to improve the diversity of the police workforce, Barber says, along with the merger of back-office functions across the 43 forces of England and Wales, which Barber argues would save hundreds of millions of pounds. Police chiefs said the report was “thorough and thought-provoking”. ‘Misguided quixotism’ – Libby Purves, the former Radio 4 presenter, has criticised the BBC for editing out racially insensitive and politically incorrect jokes from archived shows like Dad’s Army, Steptoe and Son and I’m Sorry, I’ll Read That Again. Purves said in Radio Times that she had “joined the outcry” at the editing, and that while she was sure it was well intentioned there was “no obvious end to such misguided quixotism”. “Why would a world that anxiously preserves the jejune wall-scrawls of Banksy be so cavalier with its grandparents’ record? It can’t affect us now. It’s actually refreshing to be made to cringe: it shows how far we have come.” Purves has previously railed against wokeism, often called “cancel culture”, one of the many fronts to the so-called culture wars. A million and a half people have been forced to escape their homes in Ukraine. Annie Kelly and Lorenzo Tondo explain what this growing refugee crisis looks like.

Nonetheless, here is how the UK welcomed Putin’s man in Ukraine. Frank Lampard blamed individual errors rather than tactical disarray or poor attitude for Everton’s 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham after another miserable away performance from a side that last celebrated a league victory outside Goodison Park in August. Joe Root has admitted his England team have a point to prove in the Caribbean and reiterated his own belief at being the right man to lead in a Test series that could decide his fate as captain. Eddie Jones has billed Ireland as favourites for Saturday’s Six Nations showdown at Twickenham, pointing to how they are the most “cohesive” team in the world and highlighting how England’s player release agreement differs from their rivals. Nottingham Forest will host Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals after a 2-1 victory over Huddersfield with Sam Surridge and Ryan Yates completing their comeback win.

Shares have fallen in Asia-Pacific trading after Wall Street logged its biggest drop in more than a year with markets jolted by another surge in oil prices.

The FTSE is showing a drop of 100 points, according to futures trading ahead of the open, while the pound is worth $1.312 and €1.207 at time of writing. “Kyiv rejects Putin offer to let people flee into Russia” – the Guardian’s front-page lead today. Also on page one: “Cultural ties fray as fear and outrage grip Odesa” – Shaun Walker writes from the city: “Nobody can quite believe that Vladimir Putin would launch an assault on a place bound to Russia by family, literary and cultural ties, a place of almost mythical resonance for many Russians.” “Pull your finger out” – the Metro amplifies calls by the ex-head of the army, Lord Dannatt, to speed up help for Ukrainian refugees (he actually said “extract the digit”, as the body copy reports). The i puts it in less colourful terms: “UK urged to help refugees”. “Shredded faces chart Putin’s strategy better than any map” – the Times’ splash is accompanied by a photograph of Yelena, 55, one of those maimed in Russian attacks on Kharkiv. “Please help us” – the Mirror features two little boys waiting in Calais for the UK to let them in. Its splash is “McShame”, about “burger giants and others” from the west still trading in Russia. The Telegraph has “Putin sets out his key demands to halt invasion” – they include Ukraine giving up Crimea and two separatist states, and changing its constitution to rule out EU or Nato membership. “Let it go!” – what the Sun is saying to Putin as it tells the story of a brave little Frozen fan sheltering in a Kyiv bunker. “New dash for gas to break Putin’s grip” – the Mail has the PM’s pledge to suck more out of the North Sea.

3/8/2022,"You’ll find it in the depths of Prime Video, provocatively labelled “Private Property – a psycho-sexual thrill ride”. In the accompanying artwork, a stilettoed blonde bombshell displays her rear to camera, her black and white image garishly colorised in purple and yellow. Among the listed cast, character actor Warren Oates is the biggest name, while if you’ve heard of the film’s director, Leslie Stevens, at all, it’s possibly as one of the minds behind the late-70s TV’s Star Wars knock-off Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Such a package could easily be mistaken for cheap streaming dregs. And Private Property most certainly is cheap, shot as it was largely at its director’s house for less than $60,000, a tiny sum even in 1960 when the film was released to minor outrage from those who saw it. Dregs, however, this shady home invasion thriller ain’t.Beginning seemingly at the end of a twisted Kerouacian travelogue, Private Property opens with weary young travellers Duke (Corey Allen) and Boots (Oates) stopping by a coastal SoCal gas station and attempting to rob it. When model housewife Ann Carlyle (Kate Manx) rolls through in a shiny new Corvette, Duke sees a prize victim to whom the simple-minded Boots can lose his virginity, and promptly hitches the pair a ride to her Hollywood Hills home in pursuit. There, Duke inveigles his way into Ann’s apparently picture-perfect life while her husband is away, her welcoming him in first out of pity, then desire, and him finding he may not even need to coerce his lonely quarry into sex. Uncomfortable for its sexual politics and taste in amoral protagonists even now, it’s hardly conceivable that Private Property could have existed in 1960 – indeed, the film could only have been made on the fringes of Old Hollywood. Funded independently, the production took place over 10 days, with Stevens’ home playing the Carlyle residence and his then-wife Manx taking the role of Mrs Carlyle. Shot quickly and creatively by the Treasure of the Sierra Madre director of photography, Ted McCord, with future three-time Oscar-winning cinematographer Conrad Hall as camera operator, Private Property has the shadowy, angular photography of a noir, albeit one more suggestively, violently sexual than any made in the genre’s golden age. In one moment, we watch a drunken Ann slowly being danced towards the bedroom by Duke through the distorted glass of a tumbler, a dreamlike shot that carries nightmarish implications.In an early appearance, future Peckinpah favourite Oates makes short work of a characteristically scuzzy bad guy role, though better still is Corey Allen as the noxiously charismatic Duke. Perhaps best known as cocksure Buzz Gunderson in Rebel Without a Cause, here Allen plays a calculating know-it-all, a down-on-his-luck regular Joe, a boyishly charming seducer and an entitled, bloody-minded psychopath. The latter is Duke’s true face, bared when he’s incapacitating Ann with alcohol or mockingly describing her as his plaything following a pleasant afternoon at her side: “She’s a cow … If I wanted her for myself, I could have her in the garage or on the patio, or I could have pushed her in the pool.”Though Stevens would go on to work in popular television, creating shows of a sci-fi bent like The Outer Limits, at the time of his directorial debut his interests were more grounded. Inspired by the French new wave, Stevens and producer Stanley Colbert endeavoured to be “authentic”. And so Private Property is a snapshot of America in this moment, a sinister one, looking ahead to what the country will become. Duke and Boots speak the easygoing lingo of the Beats, but their dark, destructive view of America, in particular its affluent classes, suggests the Manson Family. Their target, meanwhile, is a young woman secretly dissatisfied with the supposedly ideal trappings of a steady marriage in suburbia, and freer with her sexuality than Hollywood studio films of the period would care to admit a woman could be. Class tensions and forbidden desires simmer under the surface. At the end of the 1960s, the postwar American dream would have become curdled; in Private Property, we see it already starting to turn.Dismissed in its time – the film was condemned by the National Legion of Decency, declared indecent (if artfully made) by critics, called an “awful, sordid thing” by Jackie Kennedy – Private Property was lost for a period following its 1960 release, before it was rediscovered, restored and re-evaluated as an impressive early example of indie film-making almost six decades later. Despite being given a modern polish for its re-release in 2016, though, the film hasn’t shaken all of the grainy, tinny imperfections imposed by its shoestring production, the rough edges baked into the negative of an inescapably grubby little post-noir.

3/8/2022,"Libby Purves, the former BBC Radio 4 Today presenter, has criticised the corporation for editing archived programmes to remove content deemed offensive, arguing that the cuts are “misguided quixotism”. The public broadcaster has been editing radio shows including Dad’s Army, Steptoe and Son and I’m Sorry, I’ll Read That Again to remove racially insensitive and politically incorrect jokes, the Times revealed earlier this year. Examples included a repeat of a 1971 episode of Steptoe and Son, which was edited to cut the word “poofy” from a line in which Albert Steptoe said: “You’re carrying on like some poofy Victorian poet.” A similar snip was made to a 1974 Dad’s Army episode in which Corporal Jones referred to Chinese people as “yellow friends”. Writing in Radio Times magazine, Purves, who also hosted Midweek on BBC Radio 4, said she had “joined the outcry” at the BBC’s editing, and that while she was sure it was well intentioned there was “no obvious end to such misguided quixotism”. She said outdated sitcom jokes should be kept intact to demonstrate how society has changed. She wrote: “Why dishonestly take a smoothing iron to old jokes, gentrify the crumbly old edifices that sheltered generations from the dull hardness of life? Why would a world that anxiously preserves the jejune wall-scrawls of Banksy be so cavalier with its grandparents’ record? It can’t affect us now. “It’s actually refreshing to be made to cringe: it shows how far we have come, and makes anyone thoughtful wonder which current expressions will shock our grandchildren. I think the insulting catch-all ‘BAME’ will, for instance; as will our mad readiness to throw ‘racist’ as an insult where it isn’t deserved.” Purves has previously railed against wokeism, often called “cancel culture”, one of the many fronts to the so-called culture wars. Writing in the Times last year, Purves said the spirit of Mary Whitehouse, the Conservative activist who campaigned against the media and arts in the 60s and 70s for encouraging a more “permissive” society, was back in the form of “woke” censorship. “Today’s Whitehousery has the same blind, angry piety but with a fresh twist of punitive sadism,” she wrote. “Its hair-trigger instinct will ‘call out’ racism, sexism, ableism, privilege, ‘transphobia’ or implied insensitivity. It demands not just censorship but vengeance: one wrong word and a manager must resign, an author be boycotted, a broadcaster fined or some powerless Twitter nonentity vilified.” The BBC has been approached for comment.",News/Media,Libby Purves criticises BBC’s ‘misguided’ move to clean up old shows,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/08/libby-purves-criticises-bbc-clean-up-old-shows

The portraits, created between the early 1970s and 2019, address issues of identity and gender stereotypes, said Flavia Frigeri, a curator at the NPG. “They are not just portraiture of likeness, someone simply depicting themselves. The importance of these five acquisitions is they show the multifaceted identity of an artist, but also of women more generally,” she said. They include the first painted self-portrait by a black female artist in the gallery’s collection. Everlyn Nicodemus’s Självporträtt, Åkersberga layers multiple faces in recognition of her roles as artist, writer, mother and wife. Speaking about the painting, Nicodemus, who emigrated from Tanzania to Sweden in the 1970s and eventually settled in the UK, said: “I exhibited myself as a subject, showing every part of myself, my problems, my hopes, my conflicts – my whole life… It was a form of psychological survival.” Rose Finn-Kelcey was a major figure in the contemporary British art scene for more than four decades. Since her death in 2014, her work has been the subject of greater attention for its engagement with ideas around feminism, spirituality and commodity culture, the NPG said. Her self-portrait, Preparatory Study for “Divided Self”, shows two images of herself engaging in conversation while sitting on a bench at Speaker’s Corner in London’s Hyde Park. By speaking to herself in a place where people have made speeches since the mid-19th century, her self-portrait highlights how women’s voices have traditionally been unheard. Chila Kumari Burman is also depicted twice in her 1988 self-portrait, Aphrodisiacs Being Socially Constructed, taking the distinct roles of a young woman at rest and a warrior. Celia Paul’s painting, Portrait, Eyes Lowered, is intimate and emotionally intense. It was created as part of a series of self-portraits in conjunction with her 2019 memoir, in which she documents her relationship with Lucian Freud, who painted her many times. She said recently: “To see one’s self truthfully is one of the most challenging things for an artist… self-hatred is as invalid as self-love. Both things are false.” Susan Hillier’s Ace (Retrieved) is part of the artist’s series of portraits and self-portraits based on photo-booth images. Hillier, who died in 2019, saw photo-booths as an unfiltered medium, accessible to everyone, including “those who don’t own or can’t borrow cameras”. Frigeri said: “Each of these self-portraits challenges traditional notions of female self-representation and identity.” When the National Portrait Gallery reopens next year, it “will have many more women being celebrated on the walls – not only artists, but women from all walks of life, lawmakers, designers, gardeners, you name it,” she added. “This has plagued a lot of institutions for a very long time. Female sitters and work by women were not considered a priority for many decades.” The NPG’s acquisition of the five self-portraits is part of a three-year project in partnership with the Chanel Culture Fund.",Arts/Art and design,National Portrait Gallery boosts female representation with five new self-portraits,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/08/national-portrait-gallery-boosts-female-representation-with-five-new-self-portraits
3/8/2022,"Our style evolves as we move through life; trends come and go. When we get older, the phrase “age-appropriate” is suddenly everywhere. But not everyone is content to blend into the bland smart-casual background. Some choose to tear up their old wardrobes for something entirely different. What is it that prompts people to revolutionise their styles later in life, to swap streetwear for flouncy skirts or trousers for kilts? And how does it feel to disregard the fashion rulebook? Arlinda McIntosh, 64, New Jersey Throughout my 20s and early 30s in the 80s, I used to wear mainly oversized clothing to hide myself. I would put on leggings and a big T-shirt – things I thought I was supposed to wear, so that onlookers wouldn’t notice anything different about me. I was a married mother working as a receptionist for a cable TV company. But when my husband and I separated in my early 30s, I started altering and making clothes for friends to supplement my income. One day, I was walking down the street in New York and I caught myself in a reflection. I noticed what I was wearing and realised that, rather than dressing to avoid being noticed or judged, I needed to dress so that I could enjoy what I saw. If I’m going to style someone else, I have to be proud of what I’m wearing. I thought: who doesn’t love a wedding and the bride walking down the aisle in her big dress? I wanted to wear something that encapsulated that feeling – and nothing would stop me from wearing it every day, since life itself is a celebration. The clothes I wanted to wear didn’t exist, so I started making these big celebratory skirts, some with trains, so I could bring joy to my appearance. I went from basic to flamboyant almost overnight and wore this huge skirt that looks like a wedding skirt to the mall. I loved how I felt as I caught my reflection. Making and wearing these clothes gave me greater confidence. Eventually, I left my job to become a full-time designer. What’s the point of growing older if you’re not going to be bold about your decision-making? There’s no such thing as young people’s clothing or old people’s clothing – it is all fabric. Being a woman of colour aged over 60, you might feel like you have to dress down – to become almost invisible. Not me; I’m very visible. But I do it so I can be visible to me. You have to come into your own boldness and understand that you can do what you want. Phil Grosset, 51, York I used to dress very much in the “off-duty dad” style with ill-fitting jeans, grey T-shirts, plaid shirts and Dr Martens. I was used to blending in – it’s the same sort of look I’d had since I was 18. In 2020, an internal shift took place. I decided to identify as non‑binary. After that, there was no connection between how I felt on the inside and how I presented on the outside. I began by making small changes publicly – buying tighter-fitting jeans marketed for women and small accessories like bags – then it transformed to wearing sweater dresses, denim jackets, skirts, tights and colourful blouses. Over a few months, my dress changed completely. My wife and friends were so supportive. I don’t see gender in clothing any more. I choose things that I think look nice and make me feel good without worrying about what gender they’re marketed at. Clothes that are marketed to women have so much more choice in their patterns, colours and fabrics – it’s made me addicted to colour. I tend to throw on all the clothes I want to wear; eventually, something will match if you try enough combinations. Gender confusion can be upsetting for a lot of trans and non-binary people, but, if you get to a happier place, there’s also some fun in it and something to be celebrated. I expected a bit of hostility when I started dressing like this, but, for the most part, people either don’t say anything or they are friendly and chatty. It’s been affirming to realise a lot of people are very tolerant and thoughtful. Clothing changes the way others view you, but, more importantly, it changes how you feel about yourself. Now that I feel peaceful and comfortable with myself, I absolutely won’t go back. Najate Leklye, 69, Rotterdam Growing up in the 60s and 70s in Morocco, I dressed in a hippy style. I was attracted to bright colours and wore bootcut trousers and platform heels, or fitted flowery dresses with uncovered hair. My dress sense was very free. Around 1980, when I was 27, I moved to Holland to be with my husband. Three years later, I had my daughter and my style remained largely the same. I was teaching Arabic at an elementary school full of migrant children. Most of the women who came to Holland from Morocco at the same time as me came from the villages and they were a lot more traditional, so I stood out because I wasn’t wearing a hijab. A decade later, at 37, my husband and I divorced and I found a connection with religion. Studying the Qur’an became comforting, like finding an anchor. That was when I decided I would wear a hijab. It changed my dress sense entirely. My clothing had to become more modest – longer and not as tight-fitting. I felt empowered by my choice and my newfound love for my religion. After a few years of dressing for school in my hijab, pantsuits and heels, I began experimenting more with my original love for colour and fabrics. I found a way to have fun with it. I didn’t want to feel awkward about it, or like I was hiding. By the time I was 44 or 45, I had found a new way to express myself through fashion. My style since has been colourful and comfortable. I wear bright hues and match my hijab with my clothes. Once I retired, I wore more streetwear, too – jeans and sweatpants and sneakers bought by my daughter. It’s like I’ve got back my old sense of style from my 20s. I can be extravagant and outgoing, while still expressing my religion – something that feels rare in fashion, especially for women of colour. My confidence has always come from within, so my style has evolved as I have evolved as a human being. I never lost my eye for beautiful things and I never worried about what other people thought of me. I wear my clothes; they don’t wear me. My mantra is: have fun with what you’re wearing, since it’s OK to just be proud of who you are. Robert Batty, 70, Oban Five years ago, my knee was hit by a car door, causing permanent nerve damage. It made my knee so sensitive to touch that I can no longer wear trousers. Before the accident, I would have described myself as someone with an ordinary dress sense – jeans, chinos or smart trousers, depending on the occasion, along with shirts and polo shirts. I have never liked standing out in a crowd. After the accident, I thought about wearing shorts all the time, but when I went out in them in the winter I got rude or flippant comments from people telling me they didn’t realise it was so hot. It made me uncomfortable and anxious. A friend suggested I wear a kilt. I had one for weddings, but I had never worn it on an ordinary day. I took it with me on a trip I was making with my wife to Edinburgh. I imagined that everybody was staring at me, because people tend not to wear the kilt casually. Yet I noticed that it was a conversation starter, too: strangers would come up to me and mention that I was looking very smart, or that it was good to see someone in a kilt. It was so comfortable and avoided the awkward problem of dress codes when it comes to dining at nice restaurants or going to smart places abroad. I decided on that trip to buy another kilt. I now have 10, in a mix of tartans. Even though I felt anxious when I started wearing the kilt, now I wear one almost all the time, since it usually creates so many pleasant interactions with strangers. I’m not always smart on top, either. Not too long ago, I got rid of all my trousers, because there was no point keeping them. In a strange way, being forced to wear the kilt has made me more confident in myself. Faye McNiven, 60, Totnes My mother had an amazing, fearless sense of style – she wore a kilt with a red baseball jacket and blue trainers when she was in her 70s. She encouraged me to express myself through clothing, but I was a bit of a tomboy and always found myself wearing jeans and T-shirts in muted blues and blacks. As I got older, I felt as if I was losing myself more and more, receding into the background and blending in. Like most of us, I found the lockdowns difficult and experienced a lot of anxiety. I was working from home and wearing loungewear until, after six months, I grew fed up and started to re-evaluate how I was dressing and how I wanted to live my life. I realised that I needed to dress for myself, to embrace colour and be visible to me, just like my mother had shown me before she passed away in 1998. My niece mentioned that I should look into a Yorkshire-based company called Lucy & Yak, which makes bright dungarees and boiler suits, and I immediately fell in love with it. I started building a collection of its clothes – yellow and pink boiler suits, white boots, rainbow T-shirts – and began wearing them every day, since it’s silly to save your best clothes for when you go out. The effect was almost instantaneous – it really cheered me up. I was in a much more positive frame of mind and felt as if I was being myself. People started talking to me much more, asking where I got my clothes and saying how they were brightening their days. It made coming out of lockdown far less daunting. The whole experience has brought me much closer to a sense of community with the people who live near me. It’s been liberating not to feel that I need to dress in body-conscious clothes, or in what other people would expect me to wear as a woman. I stopped dyeing my hair as well and have gone grey – it’s all about feeling more comfortable in my own skin. It’s important as a woman who is getting older to get out there and be happy in yourself. You don’t have to be invisible. I’m no longer worried about expressing myself through clothing and colour. I am keeping it bright and won’t fade into the background as I hit my 60s.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"‘I went from basic to flamboyant overnight!’ The people who transformed their style – in their 50s, 60s and 70s",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/08/i-went-from-basic-to-flamboyant-overnight-the-people-who-transformed-their-style-in-their-50s-60s-and-70s
3/8/2022,"The number of cancer research projects in the UK fell by almost a third in the year that Covid-19 hit, data has revealed, with a leading charity saying the decline is linked to the impact of the pandemic on charity shops and fundraising efforts. Figures from the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) have revealed that spending on cancer research had been increasing in the five years before the pandemic. But the trend subsequently reversed, with spending 9% lower in 2020/21 – at £634m – compared with the year before. The NCRI – a UK-wide partnership of cancer research funders – said the number of projects funded dropped by 32% between 2019 and 2020, while the amount awarded to the projects for their whole duration plunged by 57%, from £3.03bn for projects funded in 2019 to £1.29bn for projects funded in 2020. The NCRI said several of its partners have had to make redundancies and take difficult decisions about priorities in order to maintain their research funding commitments. And it is not clear if funding will bounce back. “We are concerned that – due to the substantial decrease in the number and lifetime value of the new cancer research funded – the spend on cancer research could continue to decline over the next few years,” said the body’s chief executive officer, Dr Iain Frame. “This is because as existing projects that have been funded come to an end, there may not be new projects to replace them.” Cancer prevention was one of the main areas affected by the drop in funding, while bladder cancer and cancer of the small intestine were among the types of the disease worst hit. According to Cancer Research UK, there are more than 10,000 new cases of bladder cancer in the UK each year, and 5,500 deaths, with 49% of cases preventable. Charities have previously raised concerns about the financial impact of the pandemic on their ability to help fight cancer, warning it could last for years. Dr Iain Foulkes, executive director of research and innovation at Cancer Research UK, said the data from NCRI reflects the impact that the charity had felt from the first year of the pandemic. “Successive lockdowns forced the closure of our shops, fundraising events were cancelled and volunteering activities stopped, all of which limited our ability to raise money,” he said. Foulkes added that while it was initially expected that Cancer Research UK would see a £300m drop in income over three years, the figure is now expected to be about £250m thanks to the reopening of shops and events and other support. “This drop in income has disrupted our research funding streams, but we have been able to minimise the impact on our portfolio of ongoing research, protect our research base, and limit the damage to researchers’ careers,” he said. “If our financial performance continues to exceed expectations in future years, then increasing spending on research is Cancer Research UK’s top priority.” ",News/Society,"UK cancer research studies fell 32% in first year of Covid, say charities",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/08/uk-cancer-research-studies-fell-32-in-first-year-of-covid-say-charities
3/8/2022,"British food producers are facing surging prices for fertiliser, animal feed and CO2, which is used in packaging and the slaughter of livestock, as war in Ukraine disrupts exports from Russia and ramps up production costs. Fertiliser prices are surging towards £1,000 a tonne, up from about £650 last week, linked to a surge in the price of gas – key to the production process – and panic-buying by farmers fearing the price will rise further in the coming weeks. The NFU said prices for nitrogen fertiliser were already up 200% year on year. Farmers said they were likely to offset the price rises by buying less fertiliser than usual this season for cereal crops, potentially leading to lower production at a time when there is a threat to supplies from Ukraine, in peacetime responsible for 12% of the world’s wheat. Matt Culley, a Hampshire wheat and oilseed farmer who is head of the crops board at the National Farmers’ Union, said the new surge in fertiliser prices was adding to pressure on farmers already hit by rising labour, fuel and feed costs. “We’ve been suffering agricultural inflation,” he said. Culley said higher fertiliser prices meant greater risks for farmers because it would mean more investment in the face of other potential threats to the growing season, such as poor weather or a drop in demand without a guaranteed price for crops. He said he planned to use 20% less fertiliser, but would plant a greater area of land with crops in order to try to maintain yields and support UK production. Culley said some farmers may try to use more organic fertilisers by partnering with livestock producers or those running anaerobic digesters, which make energy from organic matter. While the UK produces about 40% of its own fertiliser, there are fears that plants may shut down operations as gas prices soar. That would also put a squeeze on the production of CO2 – released as a byproduct of the process – which is currently partly protected under an industry deal due to last until May. Yara, one of the world’s biggest producers of fertiliser, which operates in 50 countries including the UK, has said it is making day-to-day evaluations on how to maintain supply and that it is too early to say if more shutdowns may be on the cards. “Things are changing by the hour,” its boss, Svein Tore Holsether, told the BBC. “We were already in a difficult situation before the war … and now it’s additional disruption to the supply chains.” Meanwhile, Russia is the world’s biggest exporter of synthetic fertiliser, supplying more than a fifth of urea, a key fertiliser used in the UK. It has put restrictions on exports, and supplies are also being dented by ships avoiding Russian ports while insurers will not cover the cargo amid fears it will be hit by a trade embargo. Julia Meehan, head of fertilisers for the commodity price agency ICIS, said: “All everybody is talking about is availability. There are huge concerns.” She said prices had been suspended for exports from the Black Sea region as distributors tried to judge the correct new price – an unprecedented situation that could also have a huge effect on costs for north African and Turkish importers. “The only plus is that crop prices are now so high, farmers will be able to sell at a high price and technically they will have the money to pay for fertilisers,” Meehan said. The situation is likely to throw the spotlight on a €455m deal by EuroChem, a conglomerate controlled by the Russian billionaire Andrei Melnichenko, to buy the nitrogen fertiliser business of Austria’s Borealis, which was agreed last month and is awaiting regulatory approval. The deal would extend the reach into Europe of EuroChem, which is a major producer of fertiliser in Russia, despite being headquartered in Switzerland.",News/Business,Surge in fertiliser prices from Russia-Ukraine war adds to pressure on UK farmers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/surge-in-fertiliser-prices-adds-to-pressure-on-uk-farmers
3/8/2022,"With a people under attack in dire need of help, and medical supplies vital to treat the wounded, doctors from across the NHS have been gathering kit, drugs and equipment to take to Ukraine. On Thursday a convoy of cars, trucks and ambulances will start the long drive from London to the Poland/Ukraine border, carrying tons of much needed stock donated by hospitals, GP surgeries and drug companies. Once there, some of the medics will start deploying their skills in field hospitals in the war-ravaged country while others help those in refugee camps in Poland displaced by the conflict. All will help relieve the suffering caused by the Russian invasion. The initiative has been organised by Medical Aid Ukraine, a newly formed group of doctors from across the UK who are collecting donations from hospitals, GP surgeries and drug companies. It is headed by Dr Roman Cregg, a specialist in pain management at University College London hospital, who was born in Lviv, near Ukraine’s western border. He is taking time off from his NHS role to coordinate the convoy, which on its journey to Poland will join up with several carloads of doctors in France and Germany undertaking the same mission. He plans to travel over the Poland/Ukraine border into his homeland and work in a field hospital. Other doctors, including anaesthetists and surgeons, will do the same, he said. His wife, Giovanna Russo, a London GP, will stay in Poland to help out in a refugee camp. Cregg is determined to do what he can to help fellow Ukrainian medics tend to those suffering from gunshot wounds, smoke inhalation and burns. “It feels right to do everything you can to help your country,” he said. “There is simply no question – doctors must help other doctors in this situation wherever possible. “We have seen our Ukrainian colleagues [in the NHS] being recalled to serve as army medics to support their country, leaving their loved ones behind in the UK.” Ukraine’s ministries of health and defence tell Medical Aid Ukraine what supplies they need most and then its network sets to work doing its best to source them from willing donors. “Half of all NHS hospitals have made donations to us already”, said Cregg. His trust has already donated boxloads of supplies including surgical masks, gowns and gloves. As with many hospitals’ donations, most are stocks that have expired or are close to expiry or are no longer needed because Covid has ebbed. One Medical Aid Ukraine member, Dr Sophie Wallace, a lecturer in clinical medical education, has arranged for private pilots to fly donated equipment from various parts of the UK. Another member, Dr Malgorzata Starczewska, an intensive care specialist who works at a major trauma centre, has sourced the equipment needed to put together intensive units in Ukraine and is in talks with a Polish airline to transport that to Poland. Dr Alicja Jasinka-Piadlo, an A&E doctor in Northern Ireland, is taking unpaid leave to work in a refugee camp in Poland. She has previously undertaken similar work in 2015, in the “jungle” camp in Calais, along the Austrian border and also at train stations, when a record 1.3m migrants and refugees came to Europe. Dr Rebecca Cranfield, an emergency medicine doctor in Edinburgh, has mobilised the On-Call Room, a network of 11,400 medics that she runs, to donate to help Medical Aid Ukraine raise the funds to cover the cost of both equipment and transporting the supplies to Poland. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, praised the doctors’ initiative. “I am incredibly proud of the work being done by our colleagues, and it speaks to the courage and kindness displayed by NHS staff on a daily basis that so many are going above and beyond, either by helping to coordinate deliveries of supplies or providing medical support on the ground,” he said.",News/UK news,Doctors from across NHS gather drugs and equipment to take to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/08/doctors-nhs-gather-drugs-equipment-take-ukraine
3/8/2022,"After four days on the road, sleeping in her car, Ludmila Lyskevska was in a defiant mood. “Putin has gone bonkers. He wants Ukraine to be part of his imperium,” she said, stretching her legs as snow fell from a white sky. “He’s managed to unite the whole country against him.” Lyskevska was travelling in a three-car family convoy. The group was part of a vast caravan of vehicles waiting to leave war-stricken Ukraine and cross the border into Poland. Over the course of a 20-minute conversation, her group advanced a mere 100 metres. They had been queueing for 20 hours. Behind her, more cars arrived. A pensioner, she set off on Friday from the southern city of Zaporizhia on the Dnipro river. Why did they escape? “The Russians were closing in. They seized our nuclear power plant,” she said. “We feared an explosion.” She left with her daughter, son-in-law, three grandkids and a dog, now being walked on the grass next to a petrol station. Across Ukraine, millions of people are similarly on the move. As of Sunday night more than 1.7 million people have fled abroad, with 1 million crossing into Poland, according to the UN. Others had exited western Ukraine for Slovakia, Hungary, Moldova and Romania. It is Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. And it is only just beginning. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has banned men aged 18-60 from leaving the country. More than 60,000 Ukrainian expats have returned home since Russia’s invasion in order to fight. A few men waiting in the queue at the Ukrainian border town of Krakovets said they would drop their families off in Poland before returning home to take up arms. Many of those fleeing had friends and family in enemy Russia. Lyskevska said she had quarrelled with her sister who lives in St Petersburg with her Russian husband. “I rang them up. He told me the Kremlin was only bombing military infrastructure. I asked him to stop watching Russian state TV and said: ‘Our people are dying.’ He doesn’t believe me.” “Putin’s soldiers are killing civilians and shelling cities. They destroy everything. Look at Mariupol,” Lyskevska’s daughter Lena said. During their epic road trip, the family saw a rocket attack when they had parked up for the night. “We heard the explosions. Seven of them. It was terrible,” she said. The route to the border follows Ukraine’s M10 highway. It passes the western city of Lviv and goes through a long stretch of thick pine forest. Along the way are several new checkpoints manned by soldiers and local militia wearing hi-vis jackets. There are sandbags, green camouflage nets, machine-gun posts and piles of logs neatly stacked next to braziers. War feels everywhere. There is also a sense that today’s bitter conflict between Kyiv and Moscow blends with previous historic struggles. Blue and yellow flags fly next to the red and black flag of the Ukrainian insurgent army, which fought against the Red army during the second world war. Roadside billboards read: “It’s our home. We will bury you here” and “Fuck off, Russian warship”, a popular meme. The 12km queue begins on a desolate stretch of road surrounded by yellow scrub and fir trees. Many cars have signs on the windscreen with the word “Deti” – children – in Russian. On Monday the queue was 1,300 vehicles long, plus 500 pedestrians. Some mothers emerged from taxis, and walked the last few kilometres, dragging along children and suitcases. “After seven days sleeping in a Kyiv metro station, we decided to get out,” Marina Pavlova said, explaining that her 13-year-old son, Matvey, had medical issues. She added: “We are Russian speakers. We don’t need Putin to ‘save us’. We have friends like us from Kharkiv. They have vowed to only speak Ukrainian from now on because of what he has done.” Galina Padalko, a communications manager, said she and her husband, Dmytro, left Kharkiv over the weekend, after days of bombardment that saw their flat tremble. A Grad missile landed nearby last Tuesday, blowing the leg off and killing a woman who was out buying supplies. “A couple of rockets fell not far from us. We couldn’t stand it, so we decided to evacuate,” Padalko said. They walked for an hour and half to the train station, stood in a line for eight hours in -3C, and got on a train heading west. Padalko shared a video showing desperate passengers clambering over the rails in darkness before standing in packed carriages. “We travelled for 26 hours in an old electric train to western Ukraine. As we left, the Russian army shot at us,” she said. Stas Mykailov said he and his wife, Daria, decided to flee after a bomb landed close to their kids’ school, in Kharkiv’s Severna Saltivka district. “I’m an engineer. I left my flat, car, job, everything. It’s gone.” The family left by train and travelled for 18 hours. “It was very hard. Some people hadn’t brought enough water. Volunteers gave us water and apples,” he said. Mykailov said Russia was to blame for the conflict and could go “fuck itself”. “The situation is shit. I have Russian relatives. They don’t understand what’s going on here. A friend of mine called his mum in St Petersburg and she told him he was making a fuss. He shouted at her. He said he wouldn’t talk to her again until she had burned her Russian passport.” After arranging a lift to safety for his wife and two small children, Mykailov returned to the city of Lviv, 62km from the Polish border. He checked on their progress via an app on the Telegram platform that gives real-time updates. It took them 27 hours to cross, he said. “They made it an hour ago. They were four women and three kids in a car. They will go to a hotel and sleep.” He added: “At first the Polish border guard didn’t want to let them cross because the car has only five seats. Fortunately, she was a woman and she relented.” Mykailov said since they escaped from Kharkiv, a rocket had buried itself on the roof of his apartment block. “I’m on the 11th floor. It seems we have a flat without windows. The building now has a hole,” he said. Amid this biblical exodus, few refugees had given much thought as to what they might do in Poland. Nobody knew on Monday how long exile might last or whether Ukraine would exist as a sovereign entity by the time they returned. Many expressed support for President Zelenskiy. He has refused US offers of evacuation and has remained in Kyiv, despite great personal risk. Lyskevska’s grandson Dmitriy Hoholenko, who is 16, said he hoped to continue studying in Poland. The war had stopped his education. He and his classmates were too young to fight. They were patriots, he said. “I hope to find a Ukrainian school somewhere in Poland,” he added in English. And long-term? “I want to be a graphic designer,” he replied.",News/World news,‘We couldn’t stand it’: the Ukrainians travelling for days to flee Russian bombs and rockets,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/we-couldnt-stand-it-the-ukrainians-travelling-for-days-to-flee-russian-bombs-and-rockets
3/8/2022,"Against a constant backdrop of shelling and air raids, more than 1,200 international students remain trapped in the besieged city of Sumy, eastern Ukraine. Diplomatic efforts to evacuate them and create a safe corridor appear to have stalled. Many of the students have run out of water, resorting at times to boiling ice, and are running out of food. In their desperation, many are contemplating taking a treacherous journey out of the city to Poltava, 110 miles to the south. Ukrainian soldiers have warned students who have tried to leave to stay in the hostels. The journey passes dangerously close to the fighting on the outskirts of Sumy. Yet some students have felt they had no choice. Last Thursday Oluwaseun Adefemi, a Nigerian medical student in his 20s, and three of his friends paid a driver $1,600 (£1,220), several times the usual fee, and fled. “My heart was pounding, I didn’t know what to do, but I knew I had to leave. The main route to the city had been bombed, the train station had been bombed. But we finally heard that there was another route through the forests,” he said. “That day the driver just called me to say that he’s in front of the hostel. I hadn’t showered, I hadn’t brushed my teeth, my luggage wasn’t packed. I basically left everything, I just packed my documents and we started running down to the car.” At checkpoints controlled by Ukrainian soldiers, the driver told troops he was taking the students to a safety zone close to the outskirts of the city. “Then, when we started getting to the outskirts everything looked so much more real. There were destroyed armoured tanks, destroyed buses. Stains of blood everywhere on the ground. Cars that were mashed up, like armoured tanks drove over them. “There was a burial, by some soldiers. I couldn’t tell which soldiers they were but they were burying someone.” Then they drove, speeding through the snow-covered forest, parallel to main roads to Poltova that were not safe to drive on. “At times you could see the main roads through the forest. We saw armoured tanks, soldiers delivering weapons. Sometimes we saw that they were Ukrainians, because they had a band around their arm in the colour of their flag. “Sometimes we saw young people, 18, 19, 20 years old, holding guns, ready to fight. We didn’t follow routes where we thought the Russians were. I was 80 or 90% sure that if they saw us we would be shot on sight.” Adefemi’s driver was a 36-year-old Ukrainian. “He was tense. It was obvious he was afraid. He was going at outrageous speeds. The ground was covered in snow, he was trying to keep the car in control while speeding.” For large spells of the journey they lost network and were “driving blind” through forestry. After two hours of driving, they finally reached a nearby city where things felt calmer. “We wound down the windows. He played music, something Ukrainian. He relaxed, the speed reduced, he looked calm. We were getting close to Poltava.” The following day Adefemi travelled to the Hungarian border and on Sunday he arrived in Budapest, where he is staying with a relative. The journey felt like an “impossible mission” he said, with several points where it felt they could be speeding into military conflict.” Renish Joseph, from Kerala, India, is a student coordinator at Sumy State University and has lived in Ukraine for 10 years. He is currently sheltering in the university hostel with his Ukrainian wife and their two-month-old baby. He said there had been no running water in the hostel for days and tensions were running high. “Things are bad here, tomorrow will be our 15th day,” said Joseph. “These are students who are just 17 or 18 years old, this is the first time in their lives they are facing anything like this situation. This war comes after two years of dealing with Covid so physically and mentally the students are very depressed and very tired. “Every day they’re hoping that today they will be evacuated and then when it doesn’t happen, they’re getting more and more depressed and losing all hope. Some students have started experiencing bad psychological problems. At night, they will start crying or pacing around.” With no running water for drinking, showers or toilets, Joseph said the students were reliant on volunteers who came into the hostel every day with thousands of litres of water. “The students are collecting it in water bottles and using it for everything, drinking and personal hygiene. It’s desperate.” He said they went out for food early in the mornings but had to queue for hours outside supermarkets in freezing temperatures and food supplies inside stores were running low. So far, Jospeh said fighting had remained on the peripheries of Sumy and was not in the city, but he was concerned that a perception among locals that foreign students may be wealthy could put them at risk. “Everybody has a gun and we are worried because we are foreigners with brown skin so we are very visible and so anything can happen to us,” he said. “We are safe for now but we have heard that looting has already started so I don’t think we will be safe here much longer.” While the Indian government have announced an evacuation plan to get the students out via the polish border town of Poltava, which is around 150 miles away, and told them to be “ready at short notice”, so far it has been too dangerous to implement. Speaking at the UN security council meeting on Monday, TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative at the UN, said that India was “deeply concerned that despite our repeated urgings” to both Russia and Ukraine, the “safe corridor for our students stranded in Sumy did not materialise.” “There are only four to five routes which we can leave the city and all are blocked by fighting,” said Joseph. “The Russian border is only 40km [25 miles] away, but we cannot travel to Russia because Ukrainians will not allow it. So we are stuck.”",News/World news,Sumy: international students in Ukrainian city tell of desperation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/sumy-international-students-in-ukrainian-city-tell-of-desperation
3/8/2022,"One of Australia’s largest philanthropic donors to medical research has suspended ties with the University of Melbourne after last week’s awarding of honorary doctorates to six white men. The Snow Medical Research Foundation informed the University of Melbourne on Monday that it had suspended the institution from its Snow Fellowship program, as its “outcomes on gender equality and diversity do not align with the values of Snow Medical”. The nonprofit donated $24m to the University of Melbourne’s Parkville campus and last year granted two Snow Fellowships, totalling $16m, to the institution. “Unfortunately, last week the University of Melbourne awarded their most prestigious award, their honorary doctorate, to six white men,” Snow Medical said in a statement. “Further, in the last three years, not a single honorary doctorate has been awarded to women or someone of non-white descent. This is unacceptable.” The university awarded honorary doctorates to two men in 2020. Half of the six recipients in 2019 were female, including Pat Anderson, an Alyawarre woman and Indigenous health advocate. No honorary doctorates were conferred in 2021. Honorary doctoral degrees were awarded on 28 February to Leigh Clifford, Prof Sir Peter Donnelly, Prof Allan Fels, Dr Francis Gurry, Dr Mark Schipp and Prof Colin Wilks. The honorary doctorate, the university’s highest honour, was awarded to individuals “whose work has transformed our understanding of the world and the lives of many people”, said University of Melbourne chancellor, Allan Myers, at a conferral ceremony last week. The university press release announcing the honorary doctorates was later amended to add a statement about recipients who were unable to attend the in-person ceremony. “This list includes three women and an Indigenous man who were recognised for outstanding achievements in their fields of endeavour,” it said. “These honorary doctorates will be conferred at a later date.” Snow Medical said it made the decision to suspend the University of Melbourne from future fellowship applications after an “unsatisfactory” response “regarding why only men have been appointed with honorary doctorates over the last three years”. “While it appears … policies on gender equality and diversity are in place, the outcomes do not align with the university’s stated goals,” it said. “This has been a difficult decision for our family, but a decision we have made very proudly,” said Tom Snow, chair of the Snow Medical board, in a tweet. “NOW is the time for action on gender equality and diversity.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a statement on Tuesday, the University of Melbourne said: “While we acknowledge the areas where we need to improve, Snow Medical has made their decision on the basis of a single honorary doctorate event. This event is not a true reflection of who we are as a university and the steps we are taking, and continue to take, to build a diverse university community, reflective of broader society.” “We are in the process of finalising the university’s first gender equality action plan.” “Since 2019 five of the six most recent senior leadership appointments within the University’s executive team are women. This includes the Provost, three Deans, and the first Deputy vice-chancellor (People and Community).” The not-for-profit foundation said it would honour its commitment to existing Snow Fellowships already awarded to University of Melbourne medical researchers.",News/Australia news,Donor breaks ties with University of Melbourne after ‘six white men’ awarded honorary doctorates,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/08/donor-breaks-ties-with-university-of-melbourne-after-six-white-men-awarded-honorary-doctorates
3/8/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, again accused Russia of attacking fleeing civilians. Earlier on Monday his government rejected an offer from Moscow to create “humanitarian corridors” for the escape of civilians after it emerged that most of the supposedly safe routes led directly to Russia or Belarus. He accused Moscow of “medieval” tactics. Zelenskiy rallied the nation in a fresh late-night video address, saying “You do not back down. We do not back down”, adding that “heroic” resistance was making the war “like a nightmare” for Russia. Taking viewers on a tour of his quarters in Kyiv, he promised to stay in the capital until the war was won. A senior Russian general has been killed in fighting in Kharkiv, according to Ukraine’s defence ministry. It said its forces killed Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov, believed to have been first deputy commander of Russia’s 41st army. The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine is deepening as Russian forces intensify their attacks, while food, water, heat and medicine grow increasingly scarce. Some 1.7 million Ukrainians are thought to have fled the fighting and the total could reach 5 million, the EU said. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, accused Vladimir Putin of having a plan “to brutalize Ukraine”, as the UN tries to negotiate evacuation corridors. Russia’s ambassador hit back, claiming Ukrainians are shelling themselves. Britain’s home secretary is under fire for the country’s “chaotic policy” towards Ukrainians seeking refuge in the UK. Only 300 have been granted asylum so far. Zelenskiy will address UK MPs on Tuesday via videolink and is expected to plead for more arms and a no-fly zone over Ukraine to be enforced by Nato. China’s foreign minister has called the country’s relationship with Russia “iron clad” as Beijing continues to refuse to condemn the invasion of Ukraine despite growing pressure from the US and European Union to use its influence to rein in Moscow.",News/World news,Russia Ukraine war: what we know on day 13 of the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-13-of-the-russian-invasion
3/8/2022,"A Russian general has been killed in fighting around Kharkiv, Ukrainian intelligence has claimed, which would make him the second general the Russian army has lost in Ukraine in a week. The intelligence arm of the Ukrainian defence ministry said Maj Gen Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of the 41st Army, had been killed outside the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, along with other senior officers. The ministry also broadcast what it claimed was a conversation between two Russian FSB officers discussing the death and complaining that their secure communications were no longer functioning inside Ukraine. The investigative journalism agency Bellingcat said it had confirmed Gerasimov’s death with a Russian source. Its executive director, Christo Grozev, said they had also identified the senior FSB officer in the intercepted conversation. Gerasimov took part in the second Chechen war, the Russian military operation in Syria, and the annexation of Crimea, winning medals from those campaigns. If confirmed, Gerasimov would be the second Russian general from the 41st Army to die within a week in Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. At the beginning of March, its deputy commander, Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, was confirmed by Russian media to have been killed. The loss of top ranking officers has come at a time when much of Putin’s invasion force has become bogged down by logistical problems, poor morale and Ukrainian resistance. The failure of its encrypted communications system could be another severe blow. “In the call, you hear the Ukraine-based FSB officer ask his boss if he can talk via the secure Era system. The boss says Era is not working,” Grozev said on Twitter. “Era is a super expensive cryptophone system that [Russia’s defence ministry] introduced in 2021 with great fanfare. It guaranteed [to] work ‘in all conditions’.” On Tuesday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the war was “like a nightmare” for Russia and hailed the Ukrainian resistance effort. His comments came after Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, accused Vladimir Putin of having a plan to “brutalise Ukraine” by shelling cities.

3/8/2022,"International Women’s Day is upon us, and along with it the endless gabfests about women’s equality, mostly led and attended by women in suits. Increasingly we’re seeing women’s safety feature in the discussion and cursory mentions of issues facing Blak, disabled and queer women. But in 2022 the conversation about women’s equality and safety is still lacking the voices of people in the worst circumstances and those at highest risk of harm. In the lead-up to IWD, a slick new campaign with the tagline #SafetyRespectEquity has been launched to near universal praise. There’s no denying privileged women experience violent relationships. But, just as I feared, there was a glaring gap, a major threat to women’s safety that didn’t even rate a cursory mention in the campaign: poverty. The welfare system is deeply imbued with misogyny. In my work as an anti-poverty activist I hear far too many examples of how it traps women in unsafe situations, whether in the workplace, the family home or a relationship. It disproportionately harms Blak, trans and disabled people. I agree with other advocates who say it’s harmful by design. We see the results in the stomach-churning statistics. Chronic underinvestment in public housing and social security payments as low as half the poverty line means in a year 7,700 women return to their abuser due to risk of homelessness and 9,000 survivors who leave for good end up homeless. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Ninety per cent of women with intellectual disability have experienced sexual abuse. I am told stories by women who weren’t able to escape this abuse because the “safety net” failed them. According to Anti-Poverty Week* women aged 21-28 years in financial hardship were more than three times as likely to report severe partner abuse in a year. In 2019 more than 60,000 women aged 15-24 years who experienced violence also experienced moderate to very high levels of financial hardship. There are myriad reasons women are excluded from accessing support altogether. As my colleague Jay Coonan wrote recently, the partner income test is rooted in sexism and is a paternalistic hangover from a period when women were viewed only through the prism of their relationship to men. The rule reduces or cuts people off if Centrelink deems someone to be in a relationship, regardless of whether finances are shared. It’s been retained only to save the government money, at great cost to women who are forced into financial dependence – itself a contributor to the strain that can lead to relationship breakdown. Women living in Australia on the wrong visa type have no entitlement to an income support payment at all. And once you become a citizen, you are still excluded from payments such as the disability support pension – good luck to anyone who needs it within 10 years of moving here. When people who are forced to comply with punitive “mutual” obligations face sexual harassment and assault because of these activities, they are trapped. Leaving means losing your poverty payment. Women incur social security debts as a direct result of the actions of their abuser. They have payments wrongly cut off at an extraordinary rate, punishing both women and their children. And then there’s the most abusive and insidious policy: cashless welfare programs like the cashless debit card that control women’s income and restrict their ability to survive in poverty. It’s a racist program with its origins in the Howard government’s Northern Territory intervention and ever since it has targeted and punished First Nations women. Dr Elise Klein found that the CDC has not only failed to reduce violence, as the government says it’s designed to do, but there has been an increase in violence after its introduction. Of course, it goes without saying setting every income support payment at a poverty level causes direct harm. The most common payment, jobseeker, is just half the Henderson poverty line. The government’s national action plan to reduce violence against women and their children is completely silent on financial abuse. They refuse to even mention “social security” in the strategy to address family and domestic violence, while the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children says the welfare system is replicating the hallmarks of family and domestic violence. If this isn’t violence against women, what is? Advocates for women in poverty have put forward many proposals to address these harrowing statistics. We don’t need a special payment or special rules for people fleeing violent relationships. Targeted programs in effect act as a means test for people who are able to “prove” their circumstances to Centrelink – itself a traumatising process. Any such program will inevitably exclude many people experiencing or at risk of violence, particularly trans and disabled people trapped in unsafe environments because they don’t have the money to escape. The answer to ameliorating the disproportionate harm caused to women by the welfare system is a universal response that protects all women and trans folks by equipping us with access to enough resources to keep ourselves safe. We need more money but that’s not all. Raising all payments to above the Henderson poverty line while we do the work of developing a more sophisticated measure of poverty is a first step only and will not go far enough. It must be easier and faster to access welfare payments. Everyone living in Australia must be able to access them, regardless of visa status. People cannot be forced from one abusive situation to another – removing dangerous and punitive measure like ‘mutual’ obligations requirements and cashless welfare must be a priority. My friend Elly Baxter puts it simply: “The fact that mainstream feminism routinely ignores marginalised women is the reason we have been so stunted in our progress.” As an anti-poverty activist it’s clear to me that the design of the welfare system – its inadequacy, who it excludes and how it operates – is undeniably the top reason women are unsafe. It hurts us whether we’re desperately trying to avoid it, desperately trying to escape it, or see no way out of it. There is no pathway to safety, respect and equity for all women without a robust social safety net to protect those who are most disadvantaged. It’s time corporate feminism grappled with it and realised that the movement for women’s safety must not just include but be led by Blak, disabled, trans and people who rely on the welfare system to live.

3/8/2022,"Baden Hicks battled drug addiction for 20 years, during which he says he survived 18 overdoses, five by the “skin of his teeth”. He has experienced homelessness, been in and out of psychiatric wards and jail. But the 36-year-old wants to be known as more than “just a drug addict”. “I’m a father, I’m a brother, I’m a son, I’m a grandson, I’m an uncle. Through my functional addict years, I got a boilermaker apprenticeship, I went to night school and did further studies in that. I worked in the dive industry for eight years. I’m a scuba diver and a spear fisher,” he tells Guardian Australia. “People don’t choose to become drug addicts. There’s a reason why people generally use drugs. For me, I used drugs to deal with a lot of pain in my life, which really felt unbearable.” Having graduated from marijuana to cocaine, heroin, speed and ice, Hicks credits lawyer Michelle Goldberg from First Step with saving his life after she represented him in a case, introduced him to a mental health worker and helped him get a place in the service’s ResetLife program. He has now been in recovery for 15 months and has completed a certificate IV in alcohol and other drugs, is volunteering at First Step and working in peer support at Turning Point, an addiction research and education centre in Richmond, Melbourne. He has also spent time at Victoria’s parliament in recent weeks to garner support for a bill put forward by Reason party MP Fiona Patten to decriminalise drugs. Under Patten’s bill, to be debated on Wednesday, police would issue a compulsory notice and referral to drug education or treatment to people believed to have used or possessed a drug of dependence. If they comply, there would be no finding of guilt and no recorded criminal outcome. Patten has described the war on drugs as “one of the most disastrous public policy failures in modern history”, which has destroyed lives, wasted money and created a black market that has enriched organised criminals. “What we’re doing hasn’t reduced arrests, it hasn’t reduced harm. It hasn’t reduced use,” she tells Guardian Australia. Decriminalisation is supported by the United Nations and the World Health Organization and in Australia by the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Royal Australian College of Physicians, as well as several key drug and alcohol bodies. But getting politicians to buy in is another matter entirely. Both the Andrews government and the opposition have ruled out supporting Patten’s bill. “We know the harmful impact illicit drug use can have on the community – that’s why Victoria police is constantly focused on targeting drug dealers and manufacturers to break up their criminal activity,” a government spokesperson says. That’s despite costings by the Parliamentary Budget Office that found Patten’s proposal would save the state $33m between 2021/22 and 2024/25 and more in following years, thanks to a reduction in drug enforcement activity by courts and prisons, although this would be partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $1.3m due to a reduction in fines. Patten describes her model as a “streamlined” version of what’s in place in Portugal, which saw drops in problematic drug use, HIV and hepatitis infection rates, overdose deaths, drug-related crime and incarceration rates when it became the first country to decriminalise the possession and consumption of all illicit substances in 2001. Victoria isn’t the first Australian jurisdiction to debate decriminalisation. Possession of cannabis has been decriminalised in Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Northern Territory for decades. There’s also a private member’s bill before the ACT parliament that, if passed, would allow people found with a personal supply of drugs to pay a small fine rather than face criminal charges. In New South Wales, a plan to introduce a “three chance” warning system for people found with small quantities of drugs was put to cabinet in December 2020 but opposed by several ministers including deputy premier John Barilaro and police minister David Elliott. Patrick Lawrence, CEO of First Step, says in his 20 years working in the sector he has never met someone dealing with addiction who hasn’t suffered trauma. “The greatest impact of our current drug laws is felt not by the recreational drug user but people who have survived childhood poverty, sexual abuse, homelessness and the absence of love and bonding,” he says. According to the Victoria Police Drug Strategy 2020/2025, police are focused on targeting drug dealers and manufacturers to break up their criminal activity and connecting those suffering addiction with treatment and support services. The strategy states drug problems are “first and foremost health issues” and urges officers to show empathy: “Drug users could be our children, members of our family, our friends or people who have lost their way. When we see the human, we will see the way forward.” Greg Denham was part of Victoria police in the mid-1990s when a drug policy expert committee set up by then-premier Jeff Kennett recommended the adoption of a harm-minimisation approach. The committee, headed by academic David Penington, also called for the use and possession of small amounts of cannabis no longer to be an offence, while heroin and other drugs to remain illegal, but with the use of cautions and referral to drug treatment centres for the first offence. Diversions were introduced and were being used in 80% of circumstances, Denham says. “At the time police were advised that they should use it as often as they can, that a person can get more than one drug diversion. But a lot of police started to say ‘Well, why should we give them a second chance? Why should we give them a slap on the wrist so many times?’” he says, noting diversions are currently being used in 20% of circumstances. “We need policies that are actually enshrined in law rather than just words that can be easily ignored and disregarded.” Denham says the state has “slipped backwards” when it comes to drug policy reform and blames politicians. “It’s almost become a taboo topic. They’re so concerned their words may be misconstrued or they may be the next headline in the tabloid press,” Denham says. The Police Association secretary Wayne Gatt, however, maintains Patten’s bill is not needed, given officers have been issuing cautions and diverting people into treatment programs for many years. “To be quite honest the settings at the moment are quite balanced. It’s simply a fallacy to suggest that low-level drug users are all going to jail,” he told reporters last month. Patten, who has successfully led campaigns on other social reforms, including the Richmond supervised injecting room, the enactment of the nation’s first assisted dying laws and most recently, the decriminalisation of sex work, concedes her bill won’t pass without the support of one of the major parties. But she is hopeful for a commitment to progress, potentially through a trial, which wouldn’t require legislation. On Hicks’s right arm is a tattoo of a “moral compass”. Instead of coordinates, he is guided by morality, wisdom, humility and courage. He hopes politicians will take the same approach. “I hear politicians say they want to focus on mental health and physical health issues. My mental health issues and physical issues have been caused by addiction. You treat addiction and then you’re going to be treating mental illness,” he says. “You treat addiction, you change people’s lives.”  Crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

3/8/2022,"Thousands of residents in Sydney’s south-west were ordered to evacuate overnight as heavy rain swelled rivers, with fresh flood risks for places as far apart as the Illawarra and Kempsey in northern New South Wales. The State Emergency Service has given evacuation orders for a “substantial” population in about a dozen Sydney suburbs, mostly in the Georges River area. Tens of thousands of people are affected. These include parts of Chipping North, Milperra, Picnic Point and Warwick Farm. All up, the NSW SES has issued a total of 54 evacuation orders across the state and has 16 warnings out for possible evacuation. The evacuation orders to leave cover an estimated 37,530 people. The SES conducted 100 flood rescues in the 24 hours to 5am Tuesday morning. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a warning for damaging winds and heavy rain for a region stretching from near Taree on the mid-north coast almost to the Victorian border in the state’s far south. Another day, another big warning area for heavy rain, but also damaging winds: https://t.co/E0A4G0fr0O pic.twitter.com/080gtIHWPK The bureau said a low pressure system was expected to deepen and develop into an east coast low near the Hunter coast this morning and track south. It will be the second east coast low in less than a week and may bring more damaging winds than last week’s. “Heavy rainfall which may lead to flash flooding is forecast for the Mid North Coast, Hunter, Sydney Metropolitan, Illawarra, South Coast, and parts of the Central Tablelands districts,” the bureau said. “Six-hourly rainfall totals between 70mm to 120 mm are possible.” It added that totals could even reach 150mm during that period if thunderstorms developed. Importantly given the population centres, the peak of the rainfall would most likely be in the Sydney metropolitan, Illawarra and south coast districts. The track the east coast low takes before it moves off into the Tasman Sea will be key, since it’s the southern edge of the system that typically cops the worst wind and rain. Sydney's rainfall forecast has been raised to 120-150mm on Tuesday. Some areas inland topped 100mm in the past 22 hours too. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/uaI63l2s0S Sydney’s 95.4mm of rain to 9am on Tuesday means the harbour city has had the wettest start to any year. That’s according to the number crunching by Weatherzone’s Ben Domensino. By his reckoning Sydney has had 821.6mm so far in 2022, beating the previous record of 782.2mm in 1956. Rainfall data at Sydney Observatory Hill go back to 1858. Domensino says the state’s heaviest rain in the 24 hours to 9am on Tuesday was at Mittagong in the southern highlands, which received 232mm. “This is more than two months’ worth of rain for Mittagong at this time of year,” he said. Of the overnight evacuations, an SES spokesperson, Shellie Smyth, said: “There was a cell that sort of moved from up north down into Sydney, and it dumped in some cases over 100mm of rain in a very short space of time into an already saturated catchment, which caused rapid river rises. Obviously we had to issue those evacuation orders.” Among areas outside Sydney facing flood risks on Tuesday were Kempsey and parts of the Illawarra and Shoalhaven areas, Smyth said.

Rivers are also at major flood level in several parts of the state, with Sydney’s flood-prone Hawkesbury-Nepean among them. “Major flooding above the March 2021 event is occurring at some locations along the Upper Nepean, Hawkesbury, and Colo Rivers,” the bureau said. “Forecast rainfall for Tuesday may cause further renewed rises.” Warragamba Dam, which has been flooding since 3am on Wednesday, is continuing to spill, with the rate quickening again overnight, bureau data showed. As of Tuesday morning, authorities were predicting the dam’s peak spill rate could reach as much as 400 gigalitres a day, or not far from the March 2021 peak of 440GL a day. Last week’s peak was 315 GL a day. Inflows into Lake Burragorang behind the dam had risen to 300GL a day, the government said. So latest data on Warragamba Dam is that inflows into Lake Burragorang are running at 300 gigalitres a day. Maximum spill rate of Sydney's main dam is still estimated at 400GL/day, or not far shy of the 440GL/day peak rate during the March 2021 floods in the Hawkesbury-Nepean. pic.twitter.com/GHNsuthcA2 Along with the rain, there is damaging surf along much of the central NSW coast, and also the risk of damaging wind gusts that could bring down trees. Landslips are also a risk and motorists are advised to take care – if they have to be out on the roads at all in areas where the weather is particularly fierce. Those winds could reach peak gusts in excess of 90km/h in the Sydney metropolitan, south coast, Illawarra and southern tablelands districts, including the Australian Capital Territory ranges, the bureau said. “The risk of damaging wind gusts is expected to persist into Wednesday.”",News/Australia news,Sydney residents evacuated from homes overnight as heavy rain brings fresh flood risks,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/08/sydney-residents-evacuated-from-homes-overnight-as-heavy-rain-brings-fresh-flood-risks
3/8/2022,"If history is our guide, a change of federal government at the upcoming election will come in an irresistible wave or not at all. Since Gough Whitlam* ended more than two decades of Tory rule in 1972, every change of government has been a landslide. Malcolm Fraser picked up 30 seats in 1975, Bob Hawke snared 24 in 1983, John Howard gained 29 seats in 1996, Kevin Rudd won 23 in 2007 and even Tony Abbott acquired 18 extra seats in 2013. Conversely there has not been a single win from a federal opposition in a close contest in the past 50 years. When it gets down to seat-by-seat combat, the advantages of incumbency in timing, logistics and budget see even beleaguered administrations cling on to power. It is wrong to think of a federal election as a horse race. Rather it is a contest for power where the protagonists have very different objectives: one is trying to protect the shoreline from the high ground; the other is trying to get through the defences by surfing a mood for change. When government changes the nation’s next leader senses (and sometimes shapes) the wave, gets into position from the back of the break and finds a way to remain upright. This requires a combination of policy adroitness, organisational capability and a leader’s capacity to merge their personal qualities with the zeitgeist. For Whitlam it was simply “time” after decades of Tory rule; for Fraser it was an end to the chaos and conflict that he himself helped foment; Hawke unified a fractious nation; Howard promised to slow things down; Rudd was a safe antidote to ideological overreach; while Abbott just said “no” at a time the public had lost faith in a divided government. Looking at pre-election polls the critical question is not “Who is ahead?”, but is there a wave for change-building? This is devilishly hard to pick, as the waves often break late as the undeclared voters (who we are recognising in our 2PP Plus model for the first time this cycle) finally make their choice. This week’s Guardian Essential Report suggests that the tide is going out on the Morrison government, with nearly half of respondents thinking it’s time to give some else a go. The appetite for change has been building since we first asked this question last August but appears to be peaking at the right time for Labor, although one in five voters are yet to form a definitive view. Digging down into these figures, the sense it’s someone’s else turn is strongest among younger voters: 56% of under 35s are ready for change while only 40% of over 55s are ready to shift. If a wave is forming the critical question becomes whether the opposition has the pose and dexterity to get to the shore. It is here where the different rules of engagement kick in. Incumbents hold on to power by using their significant structural advantages to knock the challenger off their board and into the whitewash: think Keating’s 1993 GST scare, Howard’s border panic and more recently Morrison’s tax chimera. This is what the prime minister has been doing since the start of this year. Sensing a wave fuelled by Covid fatigue and his own malfeasance building, he is frantically looking for ways to interrupt momentum: on religious freedom, national security fears about China, and anything to make the water choppier for the challenger. Now the impact of what is likely to be a long and traumatic war in Ukraine, vividly brought home via traditional and social media, looms as a new wild card but, as this week’s poll shows, not at face value a winning hand. While there appears no real partisan difference on Ukraine in the eye of the voting public, the extent to which the war fills the public spaces where elections are usually fought has a real prospect of stemming the tide or at least reducing its intensity. This will have a real impact on Anthony Albanese who needs public focus to establish himself to the many voters who still don’t have a clear sense of him. In contrast, a protracted war provides Morrison with a guaranteed program of nationally significant set pieces to portray his carefully curated public persona from. There is no denying the magician Morrison has begun to give up his tricks, with approval ratings now in negative territory. But do not underestimate the resilience of the “ScoMo” brand for voters looking out of the corner of their eyes. To them the PM is still the family man who loves the Sharkies and goes to church, and while he may have stuffed up a few things, it’s hardly poor old ScoMo’s fault that there was a pandemic. In contrast, there’s a sense that Albanese remains hidden. Despite his 26 years in the federal parliament and service as deputy prime minister he still appears to many prosaic. Part of this is by design: Labor has clearly recalibrated after 2019’s ambitions while through the first phase of the pandemic the only credible course for opposition was to stay out of the way. Albanese has a compelling story to tell: someone born into social housing who has never forgotten where he came from, someone who has shown loyalty to his local community, leading the grassroots campaign to save the Bunnies against the power of Murdoch’s Super League. So can Albo get there? As our polling suggests the majority of us are over this chapter of national leadership and ready for a change. What currently seems missing is the drumbeat coming from the ground up. This is where those of us who want to see a change of government come in. This is a tough election for progressives. Like someone dealing with a traumatic, life-changing accident, we need to confront our demons of certainty from 2019 and lean in behind our designated surfer. Australians with disability are currently marshalling forces to defend the NDIS; the aged care sector has had a gutful; doctors are calling out crisis on our public hospitals; anyone in the creative industry or universities is still reeling from the calculated hit during lockdown; workers are sick of a system that turns their wages into dividends and executive bonuses; women are turning their backs; farmers and businesses have moved on from the climate wars and are waiting for government to follow. For all these people things have gone way beyond any one policy: this is about the very essence of being collaboratively led rather than cynically played. With so much at stake surely we all need to do better than sit back and watch the political contest as if it were a spectator sport and wait for Albo to perform his own miracle on water solo. History tells us that when governments change it is not just about the leaders, or the policies, or the field operation. It’s also about us. Are we prepared to not just vote for change but find a way to be part of it?

3/8/2022,"Frank Lampard blamed individual errors rather than tactical disarray or poor attitude for Everton’s 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham after another miserable away performance from a side that last celebrated a league victory outside Goodison Park in August. In their last home game Everton restricted Manchester City to a close-fought and contentious 1-0 win, but in their last two away matches they have not produced a single shot on goal. In a one-sided match in north London they allowed Harry Kane to score twice while Son Heung-min, Sergio Reguilón and an own goal from Michael Keane completed a miserable evening. “It’s night and day,” Lampard said. “Really good last week – discipline, gameplan, work ethic. And we started the game well today. The first 15 minutes looked like I wanted it to, but the crucial part of Tottenham’s game as a counterattacking team is to find space behind you and the players were aware of that and didn’t deal with it. If you’re going to do that you make your own problems. “The main issues were mistakes and bad defending for the goals. It wasn’t just the defensive situations – at the top end of the pitch we didn’t show enough. Even when we were in relative control we didn’t threaten their backline. There’s a clear discrepancy in home and away form, issues that were there before me and don’t take care of themselves overnight. But rather than being about home and away, if you make those mistakes you’re going to struggle. It’s important to remain positive but we can’t shy away from the mistakes we made tonight.” Tottenham now go into Saturday’s game at Manchester United on a high, and knowing that victory would take them above their opponents in the hotly contested chase for the final Champions League place. “It was an important performance tonight, a really good performance,” Antonio Conte said. “We scored five goals, we create chances to improve the final result, and I have seen that when we have more time to prepare, to play against us is difficult for everybody. “From tomorrow we have to start to think about Saturday, a crucial game for us. I put this target to my team – we have to try to stay until the end, very close to the top teams. From my arrival to now we are stronger, and I think that we can fight for this target. It’s important to have this ambition. To finish in the top four for us would be like we won the Champions League, like we won the Premier League this season.”",Sport/Football,Frank Lampard blames individual errors for Everton’s rout by Tottenham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/frank-lampard-blames-individual-errors-for-evertons-rout-by-tottenham
