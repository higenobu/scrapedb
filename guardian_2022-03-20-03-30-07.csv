3/20/2022,"The Clash have given their blessing to a new version of their song London Calling by a Ukrainian punk band called Beton. Kyiv Calling, recorded near the frontline, has lyrics that call upon the rest of the world to support the defence of the country from Russian invaders. All proceeds of what is now billed as a “war anthem” will go to the Free Ukraine Resistance Movement (FURM) to help fund a shared communications system that will alert the population to threats and lobby for international support. In the last few days the three members of Beton, which means “concrete” in Ukrainian, have rewritten the lyrics to the hit, after being given permission by the Clash’s surviving members, in order to put out a morale-boosting message of resistance and to call on other countries for aid. The new track has been mixed in Los Angeles by the music producer Danny Saber, a former member of Black Grape who has worked with David Bowie and the Rolling Stones. The new lyrics include the lines “The iron age is coming, the curtain’s coming down” and “Kyiv calling to the Nato zone/Forget it, brother, we can’t go it alone”. Beton’s band members, Bohdan Hrynko, Oleg Hula and Andriy Zholob, recorded Kyiv Calling in a studio in Lviv lastThursday and Friday. A video for the track features footage shot by the band’s friends, family, colleagues and volunteers, and captures some of the recent attacks in towns and cities, from Kharkiv to Kyiv. The musicians are now also playing a part in the war effort. Zholob, the guitarist and vocalist, also works as an orthopaedic doctor, and is treating war victims and soldiers, while Hrynko, the drummer and vocalist, and the bassist and vocalist, Hula, are part of the territorial defence and are ready to join the resistance when called upon. In normal times Hrynko is an architect and Hula the co-owner of a company that supplies sound and lighting kit for concerts and festivals. “Many Ukrainian musicians are now on battlefields or in territorial defence,” said Zholob. “They’ve changed guitars to guns. We hope this song shows Ukrainians’ spirit and our defiance to Russian aggression. We are glad it is going to be played around the world as a symbol of solidarity and hope.” Punk music is a major part of Ukraine’s cultural scene and is providing an outlet to express anger in the face of Russian aggression. The original song was written in 1979 by Mick Jones and Joe Strummer, the Clash’s late singer and lyricist, while the band travelled around the world playing gigs through another period of international instability. Their travels were marked by the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, the Iran hostage crisis and the Ixtoc I oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Back in Britain, there was also growing public discord over Margaret Thatcher’s political power, in addition to the effect of an energy crisis. Drawing on the chaos he felt around him, Strummer wrote a chorus line that deliberately echoed the old BBC radio broadcast call sign, but was intended to come from an impending dystopian future. Beton, who describe themselves as “punk-hardcore”, have played together for more than a decade at gigs and festivals in Ukraine, and admit they started out as more of a joke than a band. But since 2019, they have gained recognition for their powerful sound. Their latest album, last year’s Members Only, took a more serious look at the issues confronting Ukraine before the invasion, including police violence, the rise of shopping culture and joblessness. The band has played at some of the leading Ukrainian festivals, including Zaxidfest, Tarasova Gora festival, and their fans are said to range from children to Ukrainian soldiers. “We have no doubt about our victory, we are proud to be Ukrainians and feel the support from musicians abroad. This means so much!” said Zholob, who is also a member of FURM, a citizen-led network of thousands of people from across many professions, linking more than 30 organisations throughout Ukraine. Its mission is to restore territorial integrity and strengthen Ukraine’s sovereignty, building for a future as an EU and Nato member country. All donations made to FURM that arise from the record will go towards the non-military work of the movement in communications and support for humanitarian partner networks and organisations.",News/World news,Kyiv calling: famous Clash anthem reborn as call to arms,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/kyiv-calling-famous-clash-anthem-reborn-as-call-to-arms-beton
3/20/2022,"The Olympic 100m finalist Daryll Neita has accused UK Athletics of “blackmail” after it warned she would lose her lottery funding if she stayed with the coach Rana Reider. Neita ultimately decided to leave Reider’s training camp in Florida after the Guardian revealed that he was being investigated by US SafeSport after multiple allegations of sexual abuse were made against him. However two other British athletes, Adam Gemili and Laviai Nislen, decided to stay with Reiner and subsequently lost their right to up to £28,000 a year in lottery funding or medical support. But for Neita, the way it was handled has left a bad taste. “I didn’t move due to the federation,” she said at the world indoor Championships. “I don’t actually agree with the way they handled the situation, to be honest. “If you’re worried about the safeguarding of athletes you shouldn’t be blackmailed with funding. I think that’s two completely different things. It kind of felt like the federation just wanted to cover their backs in a way, which I completely understand. I just feel like‚ ‘do you care if I stay? Do you actually care?’” Neita said she had not seen anything improper first-hand but had decided to leave to protect her reputation. “I don’t just want to be someone who ran fast and got records,” she said. “I want to be someone who is remembered for standing for the right things in life. “I don’t want to be around controversies that don’t involve me. It’s not just what we do on the track, it’s what we do off the track. It’s who you are as a person and what you’re willing morally to accept.” UK Athletics responded to Neita’s latest comments by reiterating that it was “committed to ensuring appropriate conduct”. Neita, who is now training in Italy, also expressed her anger at her former training partner Blessing Okagbare, who was recently banned for 10 years after testing positive for human growth hormone and EPO at the Tokyo Olympics. “The Blessing thing was just disgusting,” she said. “It sucks because it was such a massive story – it has been one of the biggest doping stories in a long time in track and field and to have kind of seen it first-hand, it makes me sick. “And she didn’t just steal from competitors, she stole a lot from us – we saw her every day, at practice together, doing reps together. I haven’t really spoken about this, but I just feel like it is disgusting.” The most heartwarming story of the day came when the Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh took gold with a 2.02m clearance. The 20-year-old was at her house in Dnipro on 24 February when she was woken by the sound of explosions. She took three days to get to Belgrade but despite the tumult and trauma of the past three weeks was able to deliver. “Hundreds of phone calls, many changes of direction, explosions, fires, and air raid sirens,” she said. “I would like to think that it was just a nightmarish dream, but this is the reality of getting anywhere in my country even today. This is the reality of the war.”",Sport/Sport,Daryll Neita accuses UK Athletics of ‘blackmail’ over coach Rana Reider ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/daryll-neita-slams-british-athletics-blackmail-while-keely-hodgkinson-out-of-world-indoors
3/20/2022,"Across the west, institutions that collaborated with Vladimir Putin’s Russia are having a moment of revelation. Lawyers who persecuted investigative journalists and a financial service industry that feasted on oligarchical loot are shocked beyond measure by the invasion of Ukraine. They happily overlooked the levelling of Grozny, the war crimes in Aleppo, the missile attacks on civilian flights, the invasion of Crimea, the destructions of Russian democracy, the endemic corruption, the endless lying, and the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, Sergei and Yulia Skripal and Alexei Navalny. Only now they realise that the Kremlin may not be a reputable business partner after all. In the 20th century, the opponents of totalitarianism on the left talked of their “Kronstadt moment” – the instant when they realised Soviet communism was not an emancipatory force but a foul tyranny. Today we see “Mariupol moments” as everywhere the men and women who excused and profited from the Russian empire express their determination to do better. Everywhere, that is, except the one place where self-criticism is needed most: the Anglo-American right. No Conservative leader has matched Keir Starmer’s instruction to tyrannophile MPs to renounce Jeremy Corbyn’s Stop the War movement for giving “succour to authoritarian leaders who directly threaten democracies”. The Tory press will run as many pieces as it can on the inability of Corbyn and his allies to call imperialism and militarism by the right names even as the cruise missiles land. Yet nowhere do they find space for examinations of its failure to confront Nigel Farage for his “admiration” of Putin’s skill as an operator, or to ask why the Russian ambassador liked Farage’s bagman Arron Banks so much he offered him “opportunities not available to others” in the form of Siberian gold mines and the support of a Kremlin bank. Nowhere do we hear Tories talk of their determination to build an impassable border between democratic conservatism and the authoritarian right. The Conservatives in power have allowed corruption to flourish. Their failure to come to the immediate aid of Ukrainian refugees disgraced their party and their country. But you cannot pretend that Russian money has bought Conservative foreign policy. Boris Johnson and the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, are feted in Ukraine for supplying the resistance with weapons and training. They fight against Putin abroad but will not condemn his admirers at home. Similarly, Republicans in the US Congress have implicitly rejected Donald Trump by voting for Joe Biden’s vast package of military aid for Ukraine, while refusing to explicitly take on Trump’s tenderness for the Russian regime. The only attempt at a reckoning I have seen in our rightwing press was by one Eric Kaufmann, a populist professor of politics (if you can picture such a creature) at Birkbeck, University of London. Writing more in sorrow than in anger, that greasiest of styles, he sighs that it is a “real shame for populist conservatism” that Steve Bannon, Trump, Marine Le Pen, Éric Zemmour and Viktor Orbán had “carried water for this killer”. If only they had concentrated on attacking wokeness, crime and immigration, all would have been well. Didn’t he notice that their water carrying was not an eccentric aberration? Trump subverted elections in the US and Orbán all but abolished press freedom in Hungary. Indulgence for Putin on the “alt-right” wasn’t a bug but a feature, because he offered a road to autocracy his western admirers yearned to follow. The partisan do not like to take on their “side” for fear of giving comfort to the enemy. Perhaps more conservatives than said so in public admired Putin for being a white, muscular Christian leader who opposed the evils of liberalism. Or maybe they hated the EU as much as Putin hated the EU and, in the words of Trump’s sidekick Bannon, “believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional institutions”. But the best explanation for the silence is that the complicit find it hard to condemn. There is no clear dividing line between the right and the far right in the 2020s. The supposedly mainstream Johnson is threatening to institute voter suppression and is attacking the independence of every institution from the BBC to the House of Commons. He is not on the same level as an Orbán, let alone a Putin, but if Britain were ever to have an authoritarian leader, this government would have cleared their path. In an episode that has been too quickly forgotten, the Conservative party and Brexit party worked as an alliance in the 2019 general election, and, who knows, may need an electoral pact in future. Finally, to return to the oligarchs and their lawyers, you should never underestimate the chilling effect of the English law on public debate. Banks’s decision to sue the Observer’s Carole Cadwalladr personally, so that she faces ruin if she loses, is a sobering deterrent to Tories searching for the courage to speak out. Conservatives can always find reasons to postpone their Mariupol moment, particularly when any investigation of Russian influence runs into the Brexit referendum, whose sacral purity can never be questioned. The history of the left shows why they should make the effort. In 1948, the Labour politician Richard Crossman edited The God That Failed, a collection of essays by writers who had lost their illusions about Russian communism. Louis Fischer, who had been a foreign correspondent in Moscow, blamed himself for not seeing the truth about communism in 1921 when sailors at the Kronstadt naval base outside St Petersburg were shot for demanding freedom of speech, trade union rights and the release of political prisoners. Fischer had his Kronstadt moment after seeing Stalin use the secret police to settle political disputes in the 1930s (plus ça change, you may say). Others had theirs when Hitler and Stalin agreed to carve up eastern Europe in 1939, or when the Soviet Union invaded Hungary in 1956. A few never reached Kronstadt. They switched their allegiance from Soviet communism to Putinist gangsterism after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and carried on as before. They became Corbyn’s senior advisers and led the Labour party to a devastating defeat in 2019. Their lesson is that, if you don’t cut out the rot on your own side, it will bring your house down. That silence on the right will one day be broken by the tolling of a funeral bell.
