1/21/2022,"When the La Trobe University lecturer Dr Yves Rees was told their gender affirmation surgery would be cancelled, they were devastated. “It was impossible to contemplate,” they said. Rees’ procedure was scheduled for November, during the Delta wave, and was later reinstated when elective surgery was reintroduced in Victoria. But at the time, Rees was told there would be an eight-month wait for the procedure.  “There can be a perception gender affirmation surgeries are a choice, something people would prefer to do rather than not,” they said. “That’s not correct; the reality is these are very much medically necessary surgeries …this can be the difference between a life of constant gender dysphoria and acute stress and anxiety, and a life of feeling good.” Health experts warn delaying elective surgeries in Victoria, including gender affirmation procedures, will see blown out waiting lists spiral into a “massive healthcare crisis”. On 5 January, the Victorian government announced elective surgery – except for “emergency and urgent” procedures – would be temporarily suspended to ease pressure on public and private hospitals amid the Omicron wave. The changes came into effect from 6 January across Melbourne and major regional cities for a three-month period – to help hospitals manage record Covid-19 patients. But on Thursday, IVF procedures were exempted from the restrictions following a social media backlash, with hospitals scaling up to resume procedures from 25 January. Royal Australasian College of Surgeons president Dr Sally Langley said the recurring ban on elective surgery in Victoria had a “profound effect”. She wants a return of short-stay surgery in adequately-equipped hospitals and facilities. “Across the board, all specialties have been affected. Urgent surgery too has seen waiting times longer than ideal because of staff shortages, staff illness and staff furlough,” she said. “Victoria has already been through this with the bans on elective surgery in the last couple of years. There’ll be an even longer waiting list for important surgery and [patients] may well deteriorate.” Langley said the term “elective surgery” encompassed “serious pressing” surgeries including painful mobility and arthritic problems that would be “significantly worse” within 30 days. “We do know surgery can go ahead in a hospital that’s adequately staffed, where people are free of Covid,” she said. “Surgeons and their teams should be working to keep up their skills. The longer periods of time they’re away from work, there’ll be some anxiety about maintenance of skills.” A Victorian anaesthetist employed in the public and private sector said he welcomed the return of IVF but the current shutdown in clinical work had left him with a “very nasty taste” in his mouth. “I don’t see a reason for the overwhelming shutdown of every sector of healthcare,” he said. “Hospital and ICU beds are in short supply … so I can understand restricting surgery if those resources are required, but there’s a whole sector of day surgery procedures, where most of the patients never even see the inside of a ward or a hospital bed. Why can’t those operations carry on?” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The current national definition for elective surgery is care that can be delayed for at least 24 hours – used to distinguish between emergency care which requires action within that timeframe. The banner includes a wide range of procedures from cataract extractions and endometrial procedures to coronary artery bypass grafts, full hip and knee replacements and some cancer procedures. The department of health said further advice was being sought about other services that could resume without a “critical impact” on workforce capacity. It said the state’s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, provided advice to the acting health minister, James Merlino, that the “specialist nature” of the workforce, facilities and equipment used in IVF weren’t “imperative” to support the pandemic response. Merlino said he was “deeply sorry” for the distress caused by affected services in recent weeks and was “working to have other services restored as soon as we can”. There are three “clinical urgency” categories for elective hospital care – the highest with the potential to become an emergency within 30 days. Category two recommends admission within 90 days for a condition causing “pain, dysfunction or disability”, while category three recommends admission is “unlikely to deteriorate quickly” or become an emergency.

Is it any wonder that nurses are resigning, not renewing their registrations and moving on to other fields of work?” The anaesthetist said no new or extra requests had been made to private hospitals since Victoria’s coordinated code brown was announced, leaving the “vast majority” of staff forced to take leave due to restrictions. “It’s been two years. We cannot keep shutting down other parts of the hospital to cope with increased hospitalisations. This was fine as a short-term gap measure but is not sustainable long term.” In Victoria, according to September figures, there were 67,596 people on the waiting list for category two and three elective surgeries. In NSW, the figure was even higher, at 90,123 people. In Queensland, 53,933 people were waiting for elective care. “There needs to be a better plan moving forward, as we are going to have a massive healthcare crisis in Victoria in the years to come,” the anaesthetist said. “We have one of the lowest rates of hospital and ICU beds per capita in any developed country. How have we let this happen?” On Friday, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said plans to resume non-urgent surgery in his state would be reviewed in the middle of February, aligning with the Victorian approach “Obviously, it is highly dependent on … hospitalisations so the next week or two will be critical in terms of making a decision,” Perrottet said. “For urgent surgery, and during the Delta wave, 100% of surgery was completed on time and we continue to operate on people each and every day and the thing we’ve kept going is day surgery procedures. We will absolutely be turning surgery back on as soon as we possibly can.” For Rees, the trans community had already been disproportionately impacted by the ripples of the pandemic. They said while all elective surgery was important, unlike having a broken leg, they had to undergo years of internalised transphobia and an extensive process to prove their procedure was medically necessary. “It’s enormously stressful,” they said. “I’ve been contacted by many online who are at their wits’ end at the thought of having waited so long for these surgeries and having to wait again.”",News/Australia news,"Delaying elective surgery could spark ‘massive healthcare crisis’ in Victoria, experts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/21/delaying-elective-surgery-could-spark-massive-healthcare-crisis-in-victoria-experts-warn
1/21/2022,"Adele has been forced to delay her three-month Las Vegas residency after Covid hit the production. “I’m so sorry, but my show ain’t ready,” the singer announced in an Instagram post. “We’ve been absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and Covid. Half my crew … are down with Covid – they still are – and it’s been impossible to finish the show.”  This article includes content provided by Instagram.

The residency, titled Weekends with Adele, was due to begin on 21 January at the Colosseum in the Caesars Palace casino, celebrating her highly lauded album 30, which topped music charts in the UK, Australia and the US. Its first single, Easy On Me, broke records upon its release, becoming Spotify’s most-streamed song in a single day. “I’m gutted and I’m sorry it’s so last minute,” Adele said. “We’ve been awake for over 30 hours now and we’ve run out of time. I’m so upset and … I’m so sorry to everyone that travelled to get [here]. “We’re going to reschedule all of the dates, we’re on it right now … I’m gonna finish my show and I’m gonna get it to where it’s supposed to be.” Adele’s residency has been highly anticipated by fans and critics. The Guardian described her as a “slyly subversive fit for a Vegas residency”, bringing her trademark brand of heartbreak and vulnerability to a “place synonymous with light entertainment and celebrating adult milestones”. She joins a lineage of artists including Elvis Presley, Celine Dion and Britney Spears to take up the Vegas mantle. Vegas will also mark a shift towards more intimate shows for an artist known for her chatty, conversational style of touring, with the residency taking place in a relatively small 4,100-seat venue compared with Adele’s previous world tours. In 2017 she revealed to a stadium audience in New Zealand that “touring isn’t something I’m good at … I don’t know if I will ever tour again”.",Arts/Music,‘My show ain’t ready’: Adele postpones Las Vegas residency,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/21/my-show-aint-ready-adele-postpones-las-vegas-residency
