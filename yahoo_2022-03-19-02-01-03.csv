3/19/2022,"Gas prices in the U.S. keep going up and up, and Washington's Democrats have found a convenient scapegoat for the pain inflicted on American drivers — Big Oil. President Joe Biden says oil companies “shouldn’t pad their profits” while crude oil prices fall. Meanwhile, Democrats are pushing for a windfall tax on oil profits, and industry CEOs may face a grilling in Congress next month. But halfway around the U.S., the Democratic governor of an important oil-producing state has a different message: Oil companies might have good reason to be wary of amping up production. “I have had several informal discussions and many of them tell me they're not planning on changing their plans. What they need for that is a couple of things,” Colorado Governor Jared Polis said in a new Yahoo Finance Presents interview. First, oil companies need long-term price stability. If a company moves now, it could lose out if prices drop before new oil actually starts flowing. It “could be in six months, it could be in a year,” Polis says of the lag each company has to factor in. The price of oil has indeed been highly volatile in recent years. When many Americans briefly drove less at the onset of the pandemic in 2020, the over-supply briefly turned oil prices negative. That shook up the industry and led to pullbacks on production we still feel today. Even this week, the price of crude oil collapsed and entered bear market territory days after record highs. Aside from price volatility, capital markets could be stopping oil companies from changing course. “There was a bubble of debt that drove oil and gas production a couple years ago and they’re still on the other side of the pendulum,” Polis says. Right now, he added, “They're not interested in debt finance and expansion.” A company like Exxon (XOM) surely remembers investing over the last decade and then posting a net annual loss of $22.4 billion for 2020, the largest in its history. The oil giant survived but many smaller companies failed. In a recent oil bankruptcy report, the Texas law firm Haynes and Boone documented more than 600 industry bankruptcies from 2015 through 2021. Oil companies have plenty of opportunity to drill — including in Colorado, Polis says. “It's not about permitting; it's about deployment of capital,” he says. Some Republican lawmakers, he warned, are “almost echoing Socialist Party lines saying we should order them to do it or make them do it, sort of a centralized command economy.” As of Friday, Americans pay $4.27 for a gallon of gas, near recent highs even as the price of crude oil fell. Colorado — the fifth highest producer of crude oil in the U.S. as of last November — is a bit below average with prices at $3.96 a gallon. Politicians across Washington are focusing on the high prices, blaming both “Putin’s price hike” and supposed oil company profiteering. One liberal group proclaimed the companies ""Price Gouge Consumers After Record-Smashing Year"" in a release on Friday. Oil prices are decreasing, gas prices should too. Last time oil was $96 a barrel, gas was $3.62 a gallon. Now it’s $4.31.  Oil and gas companies shouldn’t pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans. pic.twitter.com/uLNGleWBly — President Biden (@POTUS) March 16, 2022 For his part, in lieu of trying to pressure oil companies, Polis has handled inflation differently and focused on measures to alleviate prices for his constituents such as cutting government taxes and fees. He favors suspending the federal gas tax, which would knock off 18.4 cents a gallon on gas prices; he aims to provide his constituents with additional relief by cutting state gas taxes. Beyond that, it might be a waiting game. “Look, if prices stay where they are now, there's no question domestic production will step up. But I think what a lot of producers want to see is, 'Is this just a spike in the market?' or 'Is this something that we can count on by the time we get rigs in the ground?'” Polis says.

3/19/2022,"Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker NIO Inc. (NIO) is on a massive expansion drive in 2022. The company is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 earnings results on March 24, 2022, after the market close, and investors eagerly wait to see if the upcoming financial data update justifies bullish ratings on NIO stock. NIO's Record High Deliveries to Lift Q4 Revenue The EV maker remains committed to providing monthly updates on vehicle deliveries. Vehicle deliveries during the fourth quarter amounted to 25,034 vehicles - a new record-high quarterly delivery in the company's history. Fourth-quarter deliveries represented a 44.3% year-over-year increase. Deliveries reached 24,439 vehicles during the third quarter. NIO delivered 91,429 vehicles during the year 2021, a strong deliveries growth rate of 109.1% year-over-year. Fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries were well within management guidance range, well upper range, a sign that the company will likely report revenue within the anticipated range. Revenue should surge as deliveries grow. Revenue Estimates for NIO Show Sequential Decline Back in November, management at NIO provided fourth-quarter revenue guidance for between $1.48 billion and $1.60 billion, representing an increase of 41.2% to 52.2% year-over-year and either a sequential decline of 4.4% or an increase of 3.1% from the previous quarter. Wall Street analysts currently project RMB 9,75 billion ($1.53 billion) revenue for NIO's fourth quarter. Revenue for the third quarter was RMB 9.8 billion. Analyst estimates imply a sequentially softer revenue performance during the fourth quarter, despite higher deliveries. Perhaps market watchers see sequentially lower ""Other"" revenue from charging, battery swaps, and sales of regulatory credits. The company's ""Other"" revenue segment was the fastest-growing after a 118% sequential sales growth to $181.4 million (12% of quarterly revenue) during the third quarter. Analysts expect -$0.14 per diluted share for the fourth quarter, which could show an improvement from the previous year's $1.05 loss per share. Importantly, NIO has beaten analysts' EPS forecasts over the last two consecutive quarters. Key Revenue Drivers for NIO in 2022 Product portfolio growth, geographical expansion, and the global chip supply situation may drive the company's revenue performance in 2022. NIO's vehicle sales accounted for 88% of total revenue during the third quarter of 2021. Since releasing its first EV model in 2016, the EP9, NIO has grown its product portfolio to three current models, the ES8, the ES6, and the EC6. The company unveiled a mid-sized smart EV sedan in December last year, the ET5, which will be available to the Chinese market in September 2022. Investors expect three new model launches this year. Order confirmations for a new flagship model, the ET7 have already started, and deliveries will commence on March 28, 2022. The company unveiled the ET7 in January last year. Unlike its immediate competitor Li Auto (LI), which is a bit reserved about launching new models, NIO is taking an aggressive growth stance. It's launching new models at varying price points to capture a larger diversified driver base. The company will continue to expand its charging and battery swapping network in 2022. It plans to launch sales in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark this year. By 2025, NIO expects to have a presence in over 25 countries and regions worldwide. Product portfolio growth and geographical expansions will unlock new growth potential for NIO this year. Improved chip supplies could boost productivity across the whole EV manufacturing industry globally. The Future Looks More Derisked Until recently, NIO stock was listed only on the New York Stock Exchange. The risk of Chinese stocks being delisted from U.S. exchanges was uniquely significant to it. This is no longer the case. NIO finally listed its shares on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) on March 9, 2022. Hong Kong-listed shares are fully fungible with the American depositary shares (ADSs) listed on the NYSE. Investors have another venue to continue trading in NIO stock if Chinese shares leave American markets. Wall Street's Take Turning to Wall Street, NIO earns a Strong Buy consensus rating from Wall Street analysts based on 10 Buys vs. 2 Holds. At the time of writing, the average NIO stock price target of $51.14 represents 176.4% upside potential over the next 12 months. NIO's future looks brighter as the company increases its production footprint, expands its product portfolio, and widens its geographic reach. More so as the world increasingly embraces electric vehicles as it fights the harsh realities of global climate change. That said, NIO is still a Chinese company that faces unique equity risks not shared with U.S. and European EV stocks. Geopolitical tensions may potentially suppress its valuation for longer. However, shares could rally should there be any breakthroughs on the U.S. and Chinese regulatory impasse regarding outstanding audit-related issues. A listing on the Hong Kong market acts as a hedge should the worst happen. ​To find good ideas for EV stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.

3/19/2022,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett, the 91-year-old Oracle of Investing, has seen just about every type of market. In 1999, at the height of the internet bubble, Buffett warned that investors expected unrealistic returns. In October 2008, the immediate aftermath of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, Buffett dismissed concerns about ""the long-term prosperity of the nation’s many sound companies."" In turn, Buffett has a phrase that captures exactly what the market is experiencing right now, says venture capitalist Adam Dell, the founder and CEO of a new investing platform called Domain Money. Despite ups and downs in the market, its prospects remain bullish in the long run, especially for tech and cryptocurrencies, Dell said. ""Market volatility is one of the things that is inherent in our market,"" says Dell, who spoke to Yahoo Finance on Jan. 25, well before the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. ""Whenever you have such a large inflow of capital into a discrete number of assets, you're going to have significant swings."" ""As Warren Buffett likes to say, 'The market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term,"" adds Dell, the brother of Dell (DELL) CEO Michael Dell. In this episode of Influencers, Andy is joined by Venture capitalist and Domain Money CEO, Adam Dell, as they discuss potential applications for blockchain technology, cryptocurrency regulation, and why Adam says crypto is having its ‘early dot com’ moment. The three major indexes have climbed in recent days since the Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% hike of its benchmark interest rate. But each has fallen at least 5% since the outset of this year, a rocky start to 2020 that has seen volatility befall markets amid persistent inflation and lingering COVID-19 disruptions. In early trading on Friday morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell slightly while the Nasdaq (^IXIC) ticked up. Since 1965, Buffett has built textile company Berkshire Hathaway into a giant holding company, along the way popularizing the strategy of “value investing,” which identifies stocks trading at a price lower than their book value, and patiently waits for them to rise. Late last month, Berkshire Hathaway reported almost $90 billion in profit over the course of 2021. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett pointed to ""four giants"" that have driven the company's success: its insurance operations, BNSF, Berkshire Hathaway Energy and its stake in Apple. Dell, who departed Goldman Sachs last year after leading its online-only bank Marcus, echoed Buffett's signature long-term focus as he highlighted promising trends in tech and cryptocurrency. ""As I look at the long term trends, some of the free cash flow sources that are being spit out of some of the larger tech names, I'm quite bullish on their prospects going forward,"" he says. ""As it relates to cryptocurrencies, where we're focused, I look at the fundamental underlying components of blockchain technologies and their contribution to our financial markets,"" he adds.
