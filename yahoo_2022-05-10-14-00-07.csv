5/10/2022,"STORY: Ferdinand Marcos Jr clinched a stunning landslide victory in the Philippines' presidential election on Monday, bringing the son of a former dictator back to lead the nation. An unofficial tally showed Marcos, popularly known as ""Bongbong,"" with more than double the votes of his closest rival, setting the stage for a once unthinkable return to rule of the Marcos family, 36 years after its retreat into exile during a ""people power"" uprising. Supporters in Manila cheered as news came in. ISAIAH MIRAFUENTES: ""After we vote we go here to support and wait for the result, and now we won, 20 million plus votes for BBM!"" Marcos has presented no real policy platform, campaigning on a simple but ambiguous message of unity. Marcos was criticized for skipping presidential debates and made few media appearances during the campaign, enabling him to limit scrutiny and control his message via a network of influencers and bloggers. Critics say the campaign sought to discredit historical accounts of cronyism, plunder and brutality during the two-decade Marcos dictatorship, about half of which was under martial law. The Marcos family denies siphoning off billions of dollars of state wealth during its time at the helm of what its opponents say was one of Asia’s most famous kleptocracies. That regime ended in 1986, before many of Marcos Jr's supporters were born. Some are convinced those past narratives were lies invented by his opponents. His presidency is expected to continue the policies of outgoing leader Rodrigo Duterte, whose ruthless, strongman approach proved popular, helping him to consolidate power.",Politics/Reuters Videos,"Marcos, son of Philippines dictator, wins election",https://news.yahoo.com/marcos-son-philippines-dictator-wins-225335554.html

5/10/2022,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Las Vegas is being flooded with lore about organized crime after a second set of human remains emerged within a week from the depths of a drought-stricken Colorado River reservoir just a 30-minute drive from the notoriously mob-founded Strip. “There’s no telling what we’ll find in Lake Mead,” former Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman said Monday. “It’s not a bad place to dump a body."" Goodman, as a lawyer, represented mob figures including the ill-fated Anthony “Tony the Ant” Spilotro before serving three terms as a martini-toting mayor making public appearances with a showgirl on each arm. He declined to name names about who might turn up in the vast reservoir formed by Hoover Dam between Nevada and Arizona. “I’m relatively sure it was not Jimmy Hoffa,” he laughed. But he added that a lot of his former clients seemed interested in “climate control” — mob speak for keeping the lake level up and bodies down in their watery graves. Instead, the world now has climate change, and the surface of Lake Mead has dropped more than 170 feet (52 meters) since 1983. The lake that slakes the thirst of 40 million people in cities, farms and tribes across seven Southwestern states is down to about 30% of capacity. “If the lake goes down much farther, it’s very possible we’re going to have some very interesting things surface,” observed Michael Green, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas history professor whose father dealt blackjack for decades at casinos including the Stardust and the Showboat. “I wouldn’t bet the mortgage that we’re going to solve who killed Bugsy Siegel,” Green said, referring to the infamous gangster who opened the Flamingo on in 1944 on what would become the Strip. Siegel was shot dead in 1947 in Beverly Hills, California. His assassin has never been identified. “But I would be willing to bet there are going to be a few more bodies,” Green said. First, the dropping lake level exposed Las Vegas’ uppermost drinking water intake on April 25, forcing the regional water authority to switch to a deep-lake intake it completed in 2020 to continue to supply casinos, suburbs and 2.4 million residents and 40 million tourists per year. The following weekend, boaters spotted the decomposed body of a man in a rusted barrel stuck in the mud of newly exposed shoreline. The corpse has not been identified, but Las Vegas police say he had been shot, probably between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s, according to the shoes found with him. The death is being investigated as a homicide. A few days later, a second barrel was found by a KLAS-TV news  crew, not far from the first. It was empty. On Saturday, two sisters from suburban Henderson who were paddle boarding on the lake near a former marina resort noticed bones on a newly surfaced sand bar more than 9 miles (14.5 kilometers) from the barrels. Lindsey Melvin, who took photos of their find, said they thought at first it was the skeleton of a bighorn sheep native to the region. A closer look revealed a human jaw with teeth. They called park rangers, and the National Park Service confirmed in a statement that the bones were human. There was no immediate evidence of foul play, Las Vegas police said Monday, and they are not investigating. A homicide probe would be opened if the Clark County coroner determines the death was suspicious, the department said in a statement. More bodies will be discovered, predicted Geoff Schumacher, vice president of The Mob Museum, a renovated historic downtown Las Vegas post office and federal building that opened in 2012 as The National Museum of Organized Crime & Law Enforcement. “I think a lot of these individuals will likely have been drowning victims,” Schumacher said, referring to boaters and swimmers who’ve never been found. “But a barrel has a signature of a mob hit. Stuffing a body in a barrel. Sometimes they would dump it in the water.” He and Green both cited the death of John “Handsome Johnny” Roselli, a mid-1950s Las Vegas mobster who disappeared in 1976 a few days before his body was found in a 55-gallon (208-liter) steel drum floating off the coast of Miami. David Kohlmeier, a former police officer who now co-hosts a Las Vegas podcast and fledgling TV show called “The Problem Solver Show,” said Monday that after offering a $5,000 reward last week for qualified divers to find barrels in the lake, he heard from people in San Diego and Florida willing to try. But National Park Service officials said that's not allowed, and that there are hundreds of barrels in the depths — some dating to the construction of Hoover Dam in the 1930s. Kohlmeier said he also heard from families of missing people and about cases like a man suspected of killing his mother and brother in 1987, a hotel employee who disappeared in 1992, and a father from Utah who vanished in the 1980s. “You’ll probably find remains all throughout Lake Mead,” Kohlmeier said, including Native Americans who were the area's earliest inhabitants. Green said the discoveries have people talking not only about mob hits, but about bringing relief and closure to grieving families. Not to mention the ever-growing white mineral markings on steep lake walls showing where water used to be. “People will talk about this for the right reasons and the wrong reasons,” the professor said. “They’re going to think we’re going to solve every mob murder. In fact, we may see some. ""But it’s also worth remembering that the mob did not like murders to take place in the Las Vegas area, because they did not like bad publicity going out under the Las Vegas dateline.” The right reason, Green said, is the visible evidence that the West has a serious water problem. ""The ‘bathtub ring’ around the lake is big and getting bigger,” he said. Whatever story emerges about the body in the barrel, Goodman predicted it will add to the lore of a city that, with lake water, sprouted from a creosote bush-covered desert to become a marquee gambling mecca. “When I was the mayor, every time I went to a ground breaking, I’d begin to shake for fear that somebody I may have run into over the years will be uncovered,” he said. “We have a very interesting background,"" Goodman added. “It certainly adds to the mystique of Las Vegas.”",U.S./Associated Press,Bodies surfacing in Lake Mead recall mob's time in Las Vegas,https://news.yahoo.com/investigators-try-id-2nd-set-144616933.html
5/10/2022,"Lifetime / Via giphy.com ""'Suspicious vehicle, driving very slow around the neighborhood, making notes at certain houses.' It didn't take long before she stopped being the HOA busybody. I saw her pulled over one day, so I knew the message got through."" —u/delorean623 —u/memon17 ""I was laid up in the house all day, and I get a knock at the door. It's the neighbor woman. Apparently, there's a rule that you cannot store a trailer in the driveway for more than three days, and this was day four. I needed to remove it by the end of the day or face a $500 fine. She handed me a paper listing the rule, and I considered just paying the fine, but instead, I angrily drove an hour each way to return my dad's trailer. What struck me as odd was there was a list of things you couldn't store in your driveway: personal watercraft, boats, trailers, etc. The odd part was that motorcycle was listed on there. I don't ride one myself, but I thought it was a totally reasonable thing to keep in a driveway. ""A year or so later, the HOA lady had started dating an older gentleman, and he had moved in with her. Turns out he rode a Harley, which was always parked in her driveway. She was home, so I walked over there and politely informed her about the violation. The next day, the motorcycle was parked on her new back porch, the one she bragged about to everyone who would listen so she could tell them how much it cost. I laughed to myself, but then I remembered the part about it needing to be behind a fence. Another knock at the door, and within a few days, a fence company was building a six foot privacy fence, which completely hid her fancy new deck."" —u/swyts ""This evening, I get a knock on the door. I look outside and see a woman walking away with two little dogs. One of the dogs stops and proceeds to shit on my cousin's lawn. ""I wait until the dog is done and open the door. By this time, the woman is beginning to walk away, but she sees me and turns around. She introduces herself as a board member of the HOA. Without taking a breath, she launches into a lecture about the trailer parked out front, how she's 'lucky to have walked by and caught this egregious violation of the HOA rules,' and how the trailer is an 'eyesore on the neighborhood.' She says she won't report me to the board and suggest a fine if I remove it immediately. ""I calmly inform her about the patio construction and how the crew needs to store their tools and materials at night, but she's absolutely foaming at the mouth about how 'tacky' it is to have a trailer in front of the house. I calmly inform her that I am not the homeowner, nor the owner of the trailer, and there isn't much I can do about it (especially at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday night). Nevertheless, she's adamant that I do SOMETHING. ""By this point, I'm fed up with this woman, who obviously has nothing better to do with her evening than bother her neighbors with bullshit. I look at her and casually ask, 'Just out of curiosity, what's the fine for not picking up after your dog if it shits in someone's lawn?' I tell ya, the look on her face at that point was classic. She stuttered for a minute before telling me she would 'have to look into that…' I told her I'd be grateful if she did because my cousin has been suspecting a neighbor of letting their dog poop in his lawn, so he set up a video camera in the window to catch the culprit. Upon hearing that, she got a little flustered and told me to tell the patio crew to hurry up, then she walked away with a huff. ""A small victory to be sure, but quite satisfying nevertheless."" —u/coulterpatton ""Apparently it was not all good as we received another letter stating the complaints had continued. I should note, we had just moved in not that long ago, and hadn't landscaped the back yet, so were letting our dogs pee on the front at night, which lead to the inevitable patches of bright green grass that grow stupid fast. It was in perfectly good shape outside some green spots in an otherwise average looking yard, and I do my best to keep things mowed and looking decent. ""Turns out our grumpy neighbor had taken real offense to this and started complaining to the HOA. While the HOA agreed this was not her business and definitely not theirs, I decided she was right and we should stop letting our dogs out in the front to pee. Now, I put them on the leash and let them do their business in her yard. And I'm clearly not the only one as her entire yard is now COVERED in pee spots. I'm pretty sure she's complained about everyone with a dog, and now the entire neighborhood takes their dogs to her yard. ""The best part: She actually does a shit job taking care of her lawn — weeds and crab grass everywhere. So today, I got to report her to the HOA for her yard looking like total shit. If it were any other house (there are much worse), I wouldn't care at all, but this lady wanted lawns without spots, so I'm just doing my part to enforce her rules."" —u/strongabbreviations5 ""After weeks of arguing, I had to literally pick up my 3,000-pound redwood gazebo and move it three more feet from the wall. ""Next, I get letters complaining about the vegetation in my front yard. I decided that I'm going to remove my tree and replace it. I also want to remove five plants. One of them is clearly dead by now. Their paperwork specifically says that I have to submit ONE item per design change request. So I submitted seven different requests. One for each plant. One for tree removal. One for tree installation. ""Now they're sending me generic copy-paste replies saying I can change the yard. None of them specify what design change was approved. I just keep replying to all of them asking for clarification. The last one I got said 'it' was for the tree removal and planting of a new tree...but it didn't include the original letter or even a reference number. So I just replied back that I would like the specific letter included in the email so I can have an approval paper trail. ""They burned me bad with the gazebo incident. I won't get burned again, and I'm having a grand time wasting as much of their time as possible. I smile every time I reply to an email asking for specific information."" —u/useless_skin ""Joan sent them a very threatening letter about their 'unlawful renter' and how fines would accrue if the 'unlawful renter' didn't vacate immediately. It was accompanied with a copy of that part of the bylaws and pictures of Liz's elderly mother taken through windows of their house. Creep alert! They wrote back that there was no renter and explained the situation. ""Joan did not believe that 'story' and had the HOA lawyer start sending them certified letters about their continued violations with ever increasing fines. After many increasingly aggressive back and forths, it all culminated in an association meeting where Liz, Dave, and Liz's mother came in with ID and birth certificates, and basically made Joan look like a pimple on the backside of humanity. They won, but Joan was furious, and swore she'd get them for something.  ""Cut to the following fall. Liz and Dave needed to repaint the house after making some siding repairs. They carefully checked the bylaws for approved paint colors and picked out a fairly bland shade of something between brown and tan. They gave the painters the color info listed in the bylaws, and painting happened. ""Less than a week after their house was painted, they got another certified letter from the HOA lawyer stating their house was the wrong color. It turned out the approved color and the swatches on file with the board no longer matched because the manufacturer had changed the colors in their line slightly due to some kind of formula change. Joan was out for blood after the 'unlawful renter' and forced them to have to repaint. ""Liz and Dave were taking no chances on the second try. They got the swatch set from the HOA. For some reason, it made no distinction between approved accent colors (most houses in the neighborhood had brightly colored doors) or house colors. They decided that if they had to paint their house a second time, Joan, the dog that caught the car, could live next to the most garish option they had. It was pumpkin orange. The painters asked multiple times if they were sure. They were very sure. You couldn't see the orange from inside, but you sure could from next door! ""Joan made many attempts to object to this, but it was within the letter of the HOA rules, and the house stayed orange until long after I moved away."" —u/sunnykl ""On Friday, I get a letter from the HOA stating that I am in violation of the restriction and could be fined. Okay, fair enough, they are correct on this one. I then noticed that the date of observation was on Wednesday. I called and said that couldn't be true because I took it down on Monday. Instead of admitting her mistake, she lied and said that she had seen it up on Wednesday. Now I was mad. ""I printed off a schedule of every sporting event the Bulldogs had in every sport, even club sports and then proceeded to fly the flag every single day there was any kind of game, match, regatta, etc., which was almost every single day. ""I then started getting letters stating I was in violation again. I would call on each one and explain that the water polo team had a match, or the rowing team had a regatta on those days. After about a month or two of this back and forth, they finally gave up."" —u/viking042900 ""By the time my mother received the letter, the mess had been put away, but they decided to get her on a few other complaints such as the bikes against the side of the house and the 'patchy' gravel. She had two weeks to have everything up to standards. ""Petty and easily frustrated, my mother knew immediately who called since the couple had come over and told her flat out with their renovations they were selling that house for 'way more than any other house in this neighborhood' and would appreciate if she respected that by keeping her property on par. ""For the next two weeks, every box from that garage was in our driveway. The couch and the living room TV came next. This was early summer, so it was perfect weather to sit in your yard in your short shorts and sports bra. My mom made sure to wave and smile every time they brought someone over for a showing."" —u/jumboface ""The theme he chose was Christmas in Paradise; he sold it to the association by saying it would be bright colors to off-set the dreary winter we were having. They enthusiastically approved it; they had no idea. ""He found some plastic palm trees, borrowed nine of a friend's pink flamingos, and built a sled for Santa. The flamingos had reindeer antlers, and the one in front had a red nose stuck on. The reins for his flamingos were lights not bells. He also had lights on the house, fake palms, and a sign that said Christmas in Paradise. The HOA couldn't do anything."" —u/naranghim ""The street parking rule is just the beginning of a long list of restrictions including one warranting a hefty fine for 'leaving the garage door open when not in use.' ""This came as a huge surprise since several of my neighbors have parked their cars on the street without problems since I've lived here, so I assumed it was okay. I can only imagine that they've singled me out because my car is 30 years old; however, in my defense, it's very presentable and by no means junky. ""Being singled out made me incredibly frustrated to the point where I started doing legal research. It turns out my HOA has every right to tow my project car since it's parked on a private street in the neighborhood. The good news for me is that the street just outside of the neighborhood is public, and it's 100% legal to park on it for any amount of time. ""Unfortunately for the HOA, the closest section of public street to my rental house is right in front of their nice gated entrance. Ironically, my old BMW has now become part of their image, and there's nothing they can do about it until I move out in a few months."" —u/wrassehole ""When they passed this rule, I was livid. I realized that they never mentioned which holidays we could decorate for, so the first thing I did was go out and buy red, white, and blue lights. I decorated for the 4th of July, and you better believe I left those annoying lights up until July 19. ""Problem is there really aren't major holidays from July on until October. BUT the HOA did not say it had to be a major holiday. After July 19, I decorated for International Beer Day, which was on August 4, with the same red, white, and blue lights up for the 4th of July, but I removed the sign that said 'Happy Independence Day' and replaced it with a sign I made myself that read 'Happy International Beer Day.' ""On August 19, I changed the sign to Happy National Aviation Day. I kept the same lights up though. Next was Labor Day. Yep. Just changed the sign again. On September 19, I started celebrating Rosh Hashanah. Because again, they never indicated which holidays we could decorate for. ""I kept this up over the holidays where I started with Veteran's Day after Halloween, and then went to Thanksgiving and Hanukkah. ""The board met and tried to pass a rule saying which holidays we could decorate for, BUT they couldn't get the vote when they tried to just include New Years, Valentine's Day, 4th of July, Halloween, and Christmas. They didn't include any Jewish Holidays or any other non-Christian holidays like Ramadan, and a lot of people voiced their displeasure with that. ""So they are going to meet again, and I think they are just going to change the rule to make decorations come down for the holidays in a reasonable time and not put restrictions on when we can start."" —u/jaxmagicman ""I call in and ask why I got the notice. The full description says, 'Bins in driveway with lids off.' I asked if this happened to be a Tuesday, and sure enough, it was. Wednesday is pickup, and I was doing my weekly cleaning. I was fucking using them, I calmly explained through gritted teeth. ""'Oh okay, I’ll remove the notice.' Great, but how do I prevent this from happening again? 'Oh, uh....I guess notify us.'  ""'Alright', I said, 'I’ll notify you every time I’m using my trash cans.'  ""'Oh that won’t be necessary....' Clearly, it is. ""That was five Tuesdays ago. Today, I once again called promptly at 10 o’clock and let Alan know I was about to use my trash cans. 'You know what? I’m just going to put a hold on any trash can notices for you.' Hey, that would be swell, Alan. ""That would be swell."" —u/endoman13 ""So he checked the bylaws further and found that while it was stated that all exposed walls must be painted, there was absolutely no mention of any color restrictions. ""By the time he was done, each plank was a different primary color, and there was nothing they could do about it. They were furious with him, and he laughed his ass off."" —u/procrastinator3000v2 ""Here's where the malicious compliance comes in. In our neighborhood, the roads are public, not private. We did a bit of research and found out that in our area, on public roads, a vehicle can be parked for one WEEK before it needs to move. So, we do the reasonable thing and park our huge RV in front of the house of the head of our HOA. For a week. And then we move it a few dozen feet, and leave it another week. And then go on our trip. ""We never heard about it from the HOA, presumably because they realized they have no control on public streets. After that, they stopped complaining when our RV was in the driveway for a few days every couple months."" —u/the-42nd-doctor Note: Comments have been edited for length and clarity.
