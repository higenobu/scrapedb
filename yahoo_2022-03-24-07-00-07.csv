3/24/2022,"A 57-year-old Cherokee County father, Howard Newhouse, fatally shot his 19-year-old daughter before killing himself.

The Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office responded to a shooting at a home in the Bridge Mill subdivision in Canton, Georgia, at approximately 5:45 p.m. on March 19 and found the bodies of Newhouse and his daughter. The officials confirmed that Newhouse had shot his daughter, Kathryn Newhouse, before committing suicide by shooting himself.

Kathryn’s mother was reportedly at home during the incident, but she was not injured. The teen’s brother Chris Newhouse, who woke up to a voicemail from his mother regarding the incident, attributed the incident to his family’s mental health.

“A tragic culmination of all of these different mental health issues that kind of compounded and led to such a, escalated to a situation that – it shouldn’t have happened, but it happened,” Chris told WGCL.

Chris apparently had had lunch with his father and sister earlier on Saturday and did not see any signs of anger or violence. He explained that his sister, who identified as a transgender woman, had suffered from psychological disorders for years. She was released from an in-patient mental health institution before the pandemic.

“Whenever they pushed her out of that mental health intuition and forced her to come back home, that’s when everything really brought a lot of stress and tension upon our family and that’s when a lot of the stressful stuff started happening,” he added.

Newhouse and his daughter had reportedly been arrested in separate battery cases in the past. Newhouse allegedly held Kathryn down by her throat on a bed on April 9, 2019, but the case was dismissed through a pre-trial diversion program on April 30, 2020.

In another case that occurred on Jan. 28, 2020, Kathryn allegedly struck a cup her father was holding in his hand, which resulted in his glasses being pushed into his face and cutting his nose. The case was also dismissed on the condition of Kathryn completing a mental health treatment, writing an apology and taking a life skills course.

3/24/2022,"Usmanov has been sanctioned by the European Union, the US, UK, and Switzerland. The UK government identified two mansions Usmanov owns when announcing sanctions against the tycoon. Usmanov's spokesperson said the properties have been put into trusts, and he doesn't own them. Alisher Usmanov, a Russian billionaire, has been sanctioned by the European Union, UK, US, and Switzerland as governments rushed to freeze Russian oligarchs' assets amid the war in Ukraine. But despite the wave of sanctions, the billionaire's assets might still be out of governments' reach, reports indicate. That's because Usmanov previously put hundreds of millions of dollars of assets — including most of his UK properties and a superyacht — into irrevocable trusts, The Guardian reported, citing a spokesperson for the tycoon. Such trusts cannot be amended after creation. ""From that point on, Mr. Usmanov did not own them, nor was he able to manage them or deal with their sale but could only use them on a rental basis,"" the billionaire's spokesperson told The Guardian. ""Mr. Usmanov withdrew from the beneficiaries of the trusts, donating his beneficial rights to his family."" The UK government said on March 3 that Usmanov owns mansions worth tens of millions of dollars in the country. Usmanov's spokesperson would not tell The Guardian when the trusts were established but told Reuters all the tycoon's properties were transferred in 2006. ""All of Mr. Usmanov's properties were settled into the irrevocable trusts long before the sanctions came,"" the spokesperson told Reuters. ""It had nothing to do with sanctions and was determined by estate planning."" The Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates that Usmanov is Russia's fifth-richest person, with a net worth of $18.7 billion. He founded USM, a holding company, in 2012 to consolidate his interests in a wide variety of industries, including metals, telecoms, and tech. The two mansions the UK government said belonged to Usmanov have been linked to a web of trusts and companies registered in tax havens like the British Virgin Islands, the BBC reported. ""Complex networks of secretive shell companies in these jurisdictions means the UK government is attempting to enforce these sanctions with one arm tied behind its back,"" Steve Goodrich, head of research and investigations at Transparency International UK, told the BBC. A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Reuters the country's sanctions would have a ""significant impact"" on Usmanov. Usmanov did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, sent through USM, but has said EU sanctions against him were based on ""false and defamatory allegations"" and that he will use ""all legal means"" to protect his honor and reputation.
