I didn’t want to go – I didn’t think I had to – but Gisele insisted, and as usual, she was right,” Fetterman said in a statement posted to Twitter, referring to his wife. “I hadn’t been feeling well, but was so focused on the campaign that I ignored the signs and just kept going.” “On Friday it finally caught up with me. I had a stroke that was caused by a clot from my heart being in an A-fib rhythm for too long,” the statement continued. “The good news is I’m feeling much better, and the doctors tell me I didn’t suffer any cognitive damage. I’m well on my way to a full recovery,” Fetterman said. The doctors are keeping Fetterman in hospital for observation, he said in the statement, but “I should be out of here sometime soon.” “The doctors have assured me that I’ll be able to get back on the trail, but first I need to take a minute, get some rest, and recover,” he also said. “There’s so much at stake in this race, and I’m going to be ready for the hard fight ahead.” Fetterman insisted “our campaign isn’t slowing down one bit, and we are still on track to win this primary on Tuesday.” Fetterman also posted a video from hospital where he is recovering.",News/US news,"John Fetterman, Democratic Pennsylvania Senate candidate, suffers stroke",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/15/john-fetterman-pennsylvania-democratic-senate-candidate-stroke

5/16/2022,"Chelsea are not a sentimental team by nature. Nor are they a team who appear overly preoccupied by questions of style and process. They can play football from the stars and football from the gutter – often in the same game, occasionally even in the same move. They are not, by any stretch of the imagination, an ugly or unappealing side to watch. But nor, by the same token, do they crave approval in the slightest. What does this mean in practice? If you are Jess Carter, it means that, when Lauren Hemp starts running at you with 80 minutes played in the FA Cup final, at the head of a five-on-three Manchester City counterattack, you immediately and instinctively chop her down. If you are Sam Kerr, it means that even when you have barely had a touch of the ball all game, you still somehow leave the pitch with two goals and a medal round your neck. If you are Erin Cuthbert, it means that even in the thick of a bruising and broken midfield battle you can locate the one moment of pure balletic grace that will turn the game on its head. And if you are Emma Hayes, it means you have no hesitation in substituting off one of your substitutes to close down the game, even when that player is Ji So-yun, an all-time great playing her last ever game for your club. Maybe for the neutral or the purist there was a certain unsatisfying imperfection to the way Chelsea won this: a deflected goal past a distraught goalkeeper in a game that could really have gone either way. In fact, it was hard to imagine a better expression of what Chelsea do, what they stand for, how they win. The freakish lob, the 25-yard screamer, the lucky ricochet: Hayes celebrates them all just the same like the owner of a provincial construction firm who has just received a frankly astonishing county court judgment in her favour. Manchester City had 61% of the possession here. They had 23 shots to Chelsea’s nine, created most of the running, most of the pressure, most of the chances, most of the excitement. They came into this game on a high of 14 straight wins, with key players returning from injury, with fine rhythm and momentum. None of it was of the slightest relevance. One can call it rotten luck or one can call it a lack of composure. Ultimately, when they wake up on Monday morning nursing bruises and a broken heart, it does not remotely matter. Certainly City seemed keen to match Chelsea physically, aggressively asserting their territory, tightly marking the main attacking threats. It was a niggly, grapply opening, analogous to the bit at the start of a Scrabble game where both players seem intent on assembling a thicket of annoying and usually fictional two-letter words. Kerr’s opening goal was probably what the game needed. City came forward, shed a few inhibitions and equalised through Hemp, who cut inside and smashed the ball in with her weaker right foot. Cuthbert’s long-range strike on the hour seemed to have won the game but a minute from time Hayley Raso produced a sensational run and finish to make it 2-2. Many weaker teams than Chelsea might have subsided at that point. And yet through all the wildly juddering emotions of the day, it always felt as if Hayes was in control, still orchestrating, still seeing the game unfold a few moments before anyone else. She cycled calmly through her substitutions. Five at the back became four. Chelsea rolled up their sleeves, cleared their lines, settled in for the long haul and trusted that their opponents would crack first. They were right, of course. A large part of Chelsea’s devastating potency in these games is that sense of certainty: the ability not just to envisage their own triumph but somehow to make their opponents envisage it too. There was an inevitability to Kerr as she bore down on City’s goal in extra time, an inevitability to the deflection that took the ball past Ellie Roebuck, an inevitability to the way they saw the game out under the highest pressure, with the double on the line and a crowd of 49,000 baying for more drama. And for all the excellence on the pitch Hayes is really the common denominator in all this, the architect, the dreamer. Superstars come and go. Teams are dismantled and remade. But before Hayes arrived the biggest thing Chelsea had ever won was the Surrey County Cup. She built this thing from scratch, made it flesh over almost a decade, kept renewing and refreshing the dynasty. This is how one wins the two biggest prizes in domestic football without ever really seeming to get out of third gear. Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter! Hayes’s Chelsea have played better matches, more emphatic matches, more important matches. But there has perhaps never been a match that more perfectly encapsulated their essence. You think you have them on the ropes, you think they are riding their luck but really you are just playing their game and deep down you know it. Afterwards Chelsea’s exhausted players and their exhausted coach took their curtain call and strode out towards the east end of Wembley where the blue flags were still flying. They looked not euphoric but defiant, not victorious but vindicated. “This is who we are,” they seemed to be saying. “Did you ever doubt us?”",Sport/Football,FA Cup final win encapsulates essence of Emma Hayes’s Chelsea | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/15/fa-cup-final-win-encapsulates-essence-of-emma-hayess-chelsea
5/16/2022,"Emma Hayes said her current group of players is the “best I’ve ever coached” after Chelsea’s hard-fought 3-2 victory against Manchester City in the FA Cup final. “Honestly, those women will go down in history,” a beaming Hayes said. “I will look back in 10 years’ time and I’ll be like: ‘That group was immense.’ It’s the best team I’ve ever coached. “I totally understand that we always want to talk about perfection in football but having been on the winning side more often than not, let me tell you, it’s about human endeavour. And we have a group of people who are not going to be on the losing team, they’ll find a way.” Hayes’s team twice took the lead in a thrilling chess match of a game that went to extra time in front of a record crowd for the final. Sam Kerr put Chelsea ahead in the 33rd minute only for Lauren Hemp to equalise shortly before half-time. Erin Cuthbert restored Chelsea’s lead just after the hour but the City substitute Hayley Raso scored with a minute of normal time remaining. Kerr struck again in the first half of extra time. The Manchester City manager, Gareth Taylor, said that rather than disappointment he felt pride in the fight shown by his side. “Of course I’m biased but I felt we were the dominant team for large periods of the game,” he said. “We showed character to bounce back. “We were the only team in extra time that I felt was going to go on and do it but then we made a slight error on the halfway line which ended up costing us. Obviously, it’s difficult then because Chelsea can see the finish line and see the game out. “My feeling at the moment isn’t really disappointment. Of course, we have lifted the trophy before and wanted to do it again but at the moment my feeling is of pride for the way the team has played at times.” Hayes was overcome with the win. “I seriously want to cry with joy,” she said. “I’m so happy, if you can’t tell from the smile on my face. I’ve been involved in lots of football matches. Nothing was more enjoyable than that win today. Even though my assistant nearly knocked me out following our winner. He literally pulverises me. That game was a win for women’s football. “I love these games. I love playing Man City and they love playing us for the same reason, it’s football at the highest level. Tactically both teams have their strengths. I thought we did enough because we stopped them in their game, in the way that I’ve seen them control the games. I thought we were bold; really, really bold and I think that’s why we’re the winning team.” Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter! The manager was dismissive of speculation regarding her future in the post-Abramovich era after completing the league and FA Cup double meant she has 11 major trophies with Chelsea. “You ask me this question every time that we win so it’s not like I’m coming in here disrespecting the question, but I think this needs to be about the three players that are departing rather than my future,” she said, referring to Jonna Andersson, Ji So-yun and Drew Spence. “As far as I’m concerned I don’t have to kill any speculation. I’m under contract at Chelsea and there’s nothing to talk about.”",Sport/Football,Emma Hayes hails Chelsea’s FA Cup winners as ‘best I’ve ever coached’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/emma-hayes-hails-chelseas-fa-cup-winners-as-best-ive-ever-coached
