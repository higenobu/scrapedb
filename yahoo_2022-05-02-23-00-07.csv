5/2/2022,"Kyiv said Monday that its drones sank two Russian patrol boats near the Black Sea's Snake Island where Ukrainian soldiers rebuffed Moscow's demands to surrender at the start of its invasion. ""Two Russian Raptor boats were destroyed at dawn today near Snake Island,"" Ukraine's defense ministry said in a statement distributed on social media. The defense ministry also released grainy black-and-white aerial footage showing an explosion on a small military vessel. ""The Bayraktars are working,"" Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, was cited as saying in the statement, referring to Turkish-made military drones. Raptor patrol boats can carry up to three crew and 20 personnel. They are usually equipped with machine guns and used in reconnaissance or landing operations. Snake Island became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance after a radio exchange went viral in which Ukrainian soldiers rebuffed demands from crew of a Russian warship to surrender. The Russian ship involved, the Moskva, sank in the Black Sea in mid-April following what Moscow said was an explosion on board. Ukraine said it had hit the warship with missiles. The reported drone strikes come more than two weeks after the Ukrainian military said that it had badly damaged one of Russia's most essential warships with a missile strike off Ukraine's battered southern coast. Meanwhile, a long-awaited effort to evacuate people from a steel plant in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol has begun, the International Committee on the Red Cross (ICRC) and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday. The operation to bring people out of the sprawling Azovstal steel plant was being done by the ICRC with the United Nations and in coordination with Ukrainian and Russian officials, an ICRC spokesperson told CBS News. Zelenskyy tweeted that the ""1st group of about 100 people is already heading to the controlled area,"" and said Ukrainian officials are ""working on the evacuation of other civilians from the plant.""

5/2/2022,"ROCKFORD — There's a new scam from organized crime gangs dubbed as “pig butchering."" This info comes from the Scambusters, a non-profit online newsletter. The article states two of the fastest growing scams—dating and cybercurrency—have been merged into one. While its new here, pig butcher was launched a couple years ago in China and it’s lucrative. Victims have lost hundreds of thousands—even millions of dollars. One individual, who is identified as a Denver software engineer admitted to losing $1.6 million to the crooks. Worldwide the loses are estimated to be upwards of $8 million. This scam sort of plays the long game. The term “pig butchering” refers to first fattening up the hungry or in this case, let’s say greedy victim over an extended period of time—sometimes several months—before moving in for the kill. Scambuster says at first glance the scam would appear to be a regular romance scam. However, the scammer never asks for money. Instead, the con artist talks about profits and losses they are making in cryptocurrency trading. The crooks work his target long enough to get them interested in this “investment” strategy. Also, they combine this with romantic conversations on the side. While building trust, they get their target to plow increasingly more money into the venture. Eventually, their victim may want to take their profits, but it can't be done. In fact, they may be asked for more money to meet processing costs. Before long all their money is gone. The FBI recently issued an alert about this scam, warning online daters and people who just meet up in chat forums never to send money to or trade on the supposed advice of someone you haven't met and don't know. If you don't send money or invest with them, you won't get be a pig butchering victim. Two friends contacted me last week – on the same day – regarding an email they received that was supposedly from “Norton Security” for virus protection. Both emails were payment invoices. One regarding an auto-pay renewal, the other claimed their payment had been received. An online search produced 12 different variations of the Norton email. Some of them mentioned Norton Total Protection, Norton Total All Round Security, Norton 360, Norton 360 Auto Edition, Norton PC Life, Norton Family All Device, and Norton LifeLock. Turns out, a few of these weren’t even real Norton products. This is is known as a “refund scam."" The goal of the scammer is to get their target to respond by email or phone to ask for a refund for the supposed Norton product renewal. If played out, the scammers eventually would ask for bank account or credit card information, claiming that a refund would be processed. In reality, they would take the financial details and attempt to steal funds. This scam first surfaced toward the end of last year. The best thing to do you if you receive one of these emails is to delete it. Norton says they do use email or direct mail to contact it’s customers. Because of that they have a page on their website that should answer any questions you have if you have a Norton virus protection subscription. To determine if an email from Norton is legitimate there is a verification link on the page. According to Norton, “If you have been tricked into clicking a suspicious link or opening a malicious file, you need to have your computer examined for malware. Once cybercriminals have remote access to your computer, the potential for identity theft and financial losses increase. If possible, use a separate device to locate a reputable source of technical support, as some malware will prevent you from browsing to a legitimate antivirus site.” The company also says you should forward the scam email to spam@nortonlifelock.com. Here's some other things to know from Norton: In the email subject line, mention the case number provided by Norton Support (ignore if you do not have one). Email submissions are subject to manual or automated review. The spam@nortonlifelock.com email address does not send additional updates. It is preferred to send the email samples as an attachment to avoid the loss of key content of the message, which is required for analysis.

5/2/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The CIA says Russians disaffected by Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine may be trying to get in touch with U.S. intelligence — and it wants them to go to the darknet. The agency on Monday began a new push to promote its presence on a part of the internet accessible only through specialized tools that provide more anonymity. The CIA has a darknet site that has the same features as its regular homepage but accessible only through the Tor internet browser, which has encryption features not available on most regular browsers. Instructions in English and Russian on how to access the darknet site appeared Monday on the CIA’s social media channels. The agency hopes Russians living abroad can share the instructions with contacts inside the country. While many Russians appear to support what the Kremlin officially calls a “special military operation,” longtime Russia watchers think Putin's management of the war may push away some powerful people who disagree with him. Even with immense capabilities to capture communications and satellite imagery, it remains critical for Western intelligence agencies to recruit human sources who can offer insight into the Kremlin and conditions inside Russia. “Our global mission demands that individuals can contact us securely from anywhere,” the agency said in a statement. A CIA official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters says the agency knows “there are concerned Russians who are desperately trying to reach CIA.” The official declined to say how many people had tried to reach out since the war began. “It's not safe to directly engage Americans physically or virtually” in Russia, the official said. “For those people that want to engage with us securely, this is the way to do it.” Launched in 2019, the CIA's darknet site is accessible through the Tor browser. Tor, short for “The Onion Router,” routes internet traffic through multiple third parties to mask a user’s identity and destination. After downloading the Tor browser, the user typically inputs a long string of characters followed by “.onion.” Using Tor strips away cookies and many other means of tracking the typical internet user. And while no form of communication is completely secure at all times, intelligence officers say a potential tipster will be better protected on the darknet from Russian snooping. Tor was originally created with support from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and run by a nonprofit since 2006. It has long been used by those seeking extra privacy: dissidents in authoritarian countries and people seeking to circumvent firewalls and censors, law enforcement and intelligence officers, and journalists including at The Associated Press, which operates its own tips drop box on Tor. It can be used by anyone seeking extra privacy. It has also been exploited by criminals. Russians have long had to find ways to circumvent government blocks on the internet. In response to the Kremlin's crackdown since the war began, some media outlets and Twitter have promoted usage of their own “.onion” sites or the use of virtual private network software. While officials would not disclose specifics, U.S. intelligence can be safely assumed to be working inside Russia. Calling attention to the darknet site now promotes to prospective contacts that the CIA is paying attention to their safety, said Mark Kelton, who retired from the CIA in 2015 after serving as chief of counterintelligence. “When people decide to reach out, they're very well aware of what they're doing and what the risks are,” Kelton said. “The issue here is to reassure them that on the other end, there are people concerned with protecting them.” Watershed events like the fall of the Berlin Wall have often presented recruiting opportunities for intelligence services in both Washington and Moscow. Putin's war in Ukraine and its spiraling consequences for Russia — thousands of soldiers killed, sanctions that have crippled  the Russian economy, and a failure  to meet basic military aims while images of apparent war crimes spread worldwide — could become another of those inflection points, some observers believe. Two well-respected Russian journalists, Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan, wrote  in a recent piece that the war failures have provoked “a vicious blame game” inside Russia's security establishment, known generally as the “siloviki.” Russia's military blames Putin for requiring a “new and curtailed strategy"" that it believes has tied its hands against the Western-backed Ukrainian forces, Soldatov and Borogan wrote. Some of the “siloviki” who refused to take the journalists' calls when the war began are speaking up more now. “This is the very first time the siloviki are putting distance between themselves and the president. Which opens up all sorts of possibilities,” they wrote. Personal ideology or disappointment in Putin's regime are more likely drivers of someone turning to spy against Russia than any financial rewards they might receive, Kelton said. “Crisis is always a good time for espionage,” he said. “People in autocratic societies often are content to go along until they’re confronted with the moral and political necessity to make a choice. That historically has been a ripe opportunity for people to reach out to the United States.”",World/Associated Press,Want to contact CIA from Russia?
