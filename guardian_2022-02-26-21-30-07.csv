2/26/2022," The star American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato calls herself a “belligerent optimist”. It’s a strong phrase, and a fine one, reflecting her determination to harness her high profile to an end beyond herself. Nor is she shy of addressing the biggest issues, from liberty to war to, now, our planet. Eden (Warner), conceived with her regular collaborators Il Pomo d’Oro and conductor Maxim Emelyanychev, with dryad-inspired art work to match, is a post-pandemic call to action: to repair, to replenish. The 16 tracks, some instrumental, open with Charles Ives’s The Unanswered Question and rove freely, from a premiere recording of Rachel Portman’s prayer-like The First Morning of the World to the baroque composers we associate with DiDonato, to Mahler and, yes, Wagner. The shifts and contrasts illuminate: As With Rosy Steps the Morn” (Theodora) is followed by Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen from Mahler’s Rückert-Lieder; Aaron Copland’s Emily Dickinson setting, Nature, the Gentlest Mother, flows naturally into the bizarre Sonata enharmonica by the 17th-century Italian Giovanni Valentini. Il Pomo d’Oro are agile and adaptable, especially fast and furious in the dance of the furies from Gluck’s Orfeo ed Euridice. Concept albums such as this tend to attract cynicism. Made with such dedication, Eden provokes thought and, through the persuasions of music, asks us to engage. There’s no reason to resist.  For a young musician, the stuff dreams are made of: Coco Tomita won the strings category of BBC Young Musician 2020 and was signed by a record company the next day. Coco Origins (Orchid Classics), with the pianist Simon Callaghan, is the Japanese violinist’s first album. Tomita attended the Yehudi Menuhin school, Stoke d’Abernon, Surrey (where this was recorded last summer), and now studies in Berlin. The playing, technically dazzling and characterful, bursts with musical intelligence, with the experienced Callaghan an expressive duo partner. The choice of repertoire, of her own devising, is a refreshing mix: George Enescu, Francis Poulenc, Lili Boulanger, Jenő Hubay (the spectacular Carmen Fantasy), Maurice Ravel (his Sonata No 2 in G major) and, to end, Debussy’s wistful little Beau soir. Tomita plays a Stradivarius on loan from Beare’s International Violin Society. The sound of the recording, too, is top-notch.  Bajazet, the first opera by Vivaldi ever performed at the Royal Opera House, a co-production with Irish National Opera, is broadcast on Radio 3 tonight, 6.30pm.

2/26/2022,"Rachael Laws is always diligent about doing her revision. Liverpool’s goalkeeper routinely studies video clips of future opponents, reminding herself of a striker’s little idiosyncrasies, a penalty-taker’s quirks and whether a goalscoring midfielder favours their left foot or their right. Yet when it comes to preparing for Sunday’s FA Cup tie at home to Arsenal, Laws knows homework can take Matt Beard’s side only so far. “They ooze class from back to front,” she says. “The players on their bench would be automatic starters in most WSL teams. We’ve been watching clips of them this week but it isn’t just about stopping Vivianne Miedema, there’s Kim Little, Nikita Parris, Beth Mead, Jordan Nobbs …” Even so, the Women’s Super League leaders would be unwise to underestimate a Liverpool side 10 points clear at the top of the Championship and coached by the manager who led them to successive WSL titles in 2013 and 2014. Things rather fell apart when, in 2015, Beard crossed the Atlantic to take charge of Boston Breakers but he is now overseeing a fine rebuild on Merseyside, which has reunited him with Laws. In 2013 the goalkeeper helped Liverpool win the league during a stint on loan from Sunderland and Laws, who has 10 clean sheets already this season, is keen to reacquaint herself with the elite. “In the classroom and in meetings we’re doing everything we can to prepare and hopefully my revision can help but it’s also about imposing our game on Arsenal,” she says. “If we do that, you never know what might happen.” Events at Prenton Park on Sunday afternoon should also serve as a litmus test of Liverpool’s potential. Few doubt that Laws, the recipient of an England call-up in 2014, is capable of thriving in the top flight, but some of her younger teammates will be introducing themselves to a wider public. “It’s a very good opportunity to see where we are as a squad,” says the Newcastle-born goalkeeper inspired to reach the top of the game by watching Rachel Brown-Finnis and, later, Carly Telford shine in goal for England. “We feel we could compete at WSL level but this is a chance to test ourselves against one of Europe’s very best teams.” Her enduring love for Liverpool persuaded Laws to swap WSL Reading for the then newly relegated Merseyside club in 2020 and a year later Beard, too, returned. “Matt’s been fantastic,” says Laws, applauding his refusal to resort to euphemism. “I first worked with him when we won the league in 2013 and he’s hasn’t changed much; he’s still very old-school. “With Matt what you see is what you get but I sometimes think that’s what the game’s missing now. We don’t always like being told what we’re doing wrong but you sometimes just need a bit of old-school, you just need to be told something straight. “Matt’s a very good coach, but he’s an even better manager off the pitch. He gets the best out of you by treating you, first and foremost, as a person. And, whether he’s speaking in front of the cameras or in the changing room, he’s exactly the same. Working for someone that open and honest is important. Matt’s door’s always open for us to go and talk to him and that connection matters. It’s good he hasn’t changed.” Beard’s directness has helped Liverpool acquire renewed support from their parent men’s club, whose failure to maintain proper investment in the women’s squad and its infrastructure prefaced the ignominy of relegation followed by last summer’s modest third-place finish. “Things have changed tenfold,” says Laws. “We get treated very, very well by the men. They’re looking after us now; they’ve been fantastic this season and have got us involved in sponsorship and advertising deals on a level playing field.” Although later on Sunday afternoon Liverpool’s men face Chelsea at Wembley in the League Cup final, a decent crowd is still expected at Prenton Park where a relaxation of Covid restrictions means players can finally interact with supporters. “It’s been frustrating not to be able to greet our fans this season, we’ve only been able to wave at them from a distance,” says Laws. “So being able to have a conversation in close proximity with someone and show our appreciation on Sunday will be so nice. It makes all the difference. We’ve missed the high fives, the hugs and the chats we used to share with our supporters.”",Sport/Football,"‘Arsenal ooze class but you never know,’ hopes Liverpool’s Rachael Laws",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/26/liverpool-rachel-laws-arsenal-ooze-class-imposing-our-game-womens-fa-cup
2/26/2022,"Outside Northampton’s Royal & Derngate theatre on Friday night, there was nothing but sympathy and solidarity for the dancers of the Russian State Ballet of Siberia performing on stage that evening. “I was waiting to see whether it would be cancelled this afternoon, but more because they themselves, the Russians, might have thought they can’t go and do this. They must be wondering what reception they will get. I imagine they are nervous,” said Selina Bidwell, who was attending the event with her mother, Veronica Ridzwan. “But it’s not their fault, we should not penalise them. They are just trying to make a living. It’s not their fault they have a despot for a leader. We don’t know them, but if they are the ones that don’t agree with it, we need to support them,” she said. On the same night, the Helix theatre in Dublin decided to cancel a performance of Swan Lake by the Royal Moscow Ballet “to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine”. The dance company responded by saying it was not funded or sponsored by the Russian government, and that it didn’t carry “any political message on this tour”. “We simply dance for peace,” it added. On Friday the Royal Opera House in London said it had cancelled a tour from Russia’s Bolshoi Ballet in light of the crisis in Ukraine. “A summer season of the Bolshoi Ballet at the Royal Opera House had been in the final stages of planning,” it said in a statement. “Unfortunately, under the current circumstances, the season cannot now go ahead.” The Russian State Ballet of Siberia, which has been performing in the UK since 2007, was doing a three-night run in Northampton, performing Cinderella, The Snow Maiden and The Nutcracker. “There’s a million and one things we can do to help, and cancelling [the ballet] is not one of them,” said one audience member at the Northampton show, who asked not to be named. He was wearing a yellow tie and trousers with a blue shirt to show solidarity with Ukraine, and said he had expected to see a protest outside the theatre. “But it’s not their fault. It’s one man’s fault, he’s a megalomaniac. I don’t really do politics but I hate bullies,” he said. Ridzwan said the huge anti-war rallies taking place in Russia, in spite of Putin’s strict regime, showed how much of the Russian population opposed the invasion. “Not just in Moscow, all across the country they have come out. We have got to support them really,” she said. “Those people in there are nothing to do with the actual war. Why should they be punished and blacklisted?” said another guest, Jennifer Cartwright. Her daughter, Penny Welsh, said she understood why some people might feel uncomfortable attending. “I think some people might think it’s showing where your loyalties lie,” she said. “But it’s not. This is art, this is something beautiful, regardless of where it comes from. We are all still people, and after the two years we have had, why can’t we enjoy some beauty?”",Arts/Stage,Ballet goes on as UK audience backs Russian dancers,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/26/ballet-goes-on-as-uk-audience-backs-russian-dancers
2/26/2022,"Never ones to let a good crisis go to waste, the fossil fuel industry and their allies have taken to the airwaves over the last few days to try and use the Russian invasion of Ukraine as an excuse for greater oil and gas development. It’s the classic shock doctrine that we’ve come to expect from big oil, and unless our politicians are wise enough to see through it, it’s a strategy that will continue to undermine our ability to take action on climate change over the decade to come. The fossil fuel industry’s attempt to exploit this particular crisis is all the more galling because of their central role in causing it. Putin’s ability to wage war in Ukraine and threaten the stability of Europe comes exclusively from his control over Russian oil and gas production. Forty per cent of Russia’s federal budget comes from oil and gas, which make up 60% of the country’s exports. This October, Russia was making more than $500m a day from fossil fuels, money that goes directly into funding Putin’s war machine. No one in the oil and gas industry denies this. What they’d like us to conveniently forget is how they helped Putin get to this point. Russia never could have become such an oil and gas superpower without the help of western oil companies like ExxonMobil and BP, which owns a 20% share of Rosneft, Russia’s state owned oil company. Back in 2014, when Rosneft’s oil and gas production was largely flat, ExxonMobil partnered with Rosneft to help them modernize operations and expand production in the Arctic. The partnership went so well that Putin awarded former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson the Order of Friendship, one of the highest honors Russia bestows on foreigners. Exxon has returned the favor, joining with other US oil giants and their trade association, the American Petroleum Institute, to repeatedly lobby against Russian sanctions, including in 2018 when Congress tried to prevent future Russian meddling in US elections, and today, as Congress attempts to impose stricter sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Sanctions should be as targeted as possible to limit potential harm to the competitiveness of US companies,” an American Petroleum Institute spokesperson said recently. The companies he’s talking about aren’t your Main Street mom-and-pop’s: they’re the richest oil corporations on the planet. As big oil tries to defend their investments in Russia, they’re simultaneously making the case that greater production at home will help combat Putin’s influence on the global stage. It’s like a drug dealer trying to convince authorities that the best way to take out a rival isn’t to crack down on drugs, but allow him to increase production. The net effect will be the same: more addicts, in this case to climate destroying fossil fuels. While US LNG exports may help Europe in the short term, increasing US production will only deepen Europe’s dependence on fossil fuels and continue to prop up a global cartel in which Putin is a major player. The only viable long term solution is for Europe – and the rest of the world – to move as quickly as possible to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels with energy efficiency and renewables, as some forward-looking European politicians have been calling for. If the Biden administration wants to help, it should launch a new green Marshall plan to help build renewable energy in Europe and around the world. Expanding the production of clean energy technologies, rather than fossil fuels, would help combat the influence of big oil and petro states, as well as address the growing climate emergency. As we’ve already learned with the Covid-19 pandemic, this decade won’t afford us the gift of getting to tackle one crisis at a time. Instead of letting big oil use each new shock to knock us off course, we need to stay clear eyed on how we can create peace, stability, and protect our planet for generations to come: ending our addiction to fossil fuels.
