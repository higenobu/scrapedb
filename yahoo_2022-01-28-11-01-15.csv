1/28/2022,"Apple (AAPL) reported its Q1 earnings on Thursday, blowing away Wall Street's expectations with a historic quarter on strong demand for the iPhone 13 and services. Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what analysts were expecting from the company as compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue: $123.95 billion versus $119.05 billion expected. Earnings per share: $2.10 versus $1.90 per share expected. iPhone: $71.6 billion versus $67.7 billion expected1. iPad: $7.2 billion versus $8.1 billion expected. Mac: $10.8 billion versus $9.5 billion expected. Wearables: $14.7 billion versus $14.1 billion expected. Services: $19.5 billion versus $18.6 billion expected. Apple's stock was up more than 1% following the announcement. The company's revenue jumped some 11% in Q1 despite the ongoing chip shortage, which took a $6 billion bite out of Apple's revenue in Q4 2021. ""This quarter’s record results were made possible by our most innovative lineup of products and services ever,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. “We are gratified to see the response from customers around the world at a time when staying connected has never been more important."" The holiday quarter is incredibly important for Apple, as it provides Wall Street with a look at how the company's products may perform throughout the rest of the year. Moving forward, Wedbush's Dan Ives offered a positive outlook for Apple's Q2. “While the supply chain issues have curtailed some growth for Apple on this massive product cycle playing out across its entire hardware ecosystem, we believe the pent-up demand story for Cupertino is still being underestimated by investors with chip issues a somewhat transitory issue in our opinion,” Ives wrote. Bloomberg reports that Apple is also expected to launch a 5G-capable version of its iPhone SE in the coming months, along with updated versions of its iPad and Mac laptops. But it will be some time before those rumored products show up on Apple’s bottom line.

1/28/2022,"Investors may soon be able to preserve their retirement war chest for longer. The Securing a Strong Retirement Act, a bill originally pushed in 2021 but which may finally pass this year, would push the starting point for required minimum distributions (RMDs) from age 72 to 74 and 75. That means retirees could stave off being required to tap into their tax-deferred retirement accounts like 401(k)s and preserve their nest eggs for more years. This is on top of the news from earlier this month that the IRS is adjusting its actuarial tables on RMDs for the first time in 20 years. In response to longer projected life spans, that means retirees can take out less money at 72, under the current RMD starting age. The recent lowering of RMDs and the proposed delay of the RMD starting age are part of a trend to account for longer retirement periods and help retirees preserve their coffers throughout their golden years. These dynamics further enhance shifts that arrived with the 2019 SECURE Act, which pushed the RMD starting age from 70.5 to 72. If you want help planning for your retirement and strategizing how to manage these changes, consider finding a professional using SmartAsset’s free financial advisor matching service. How RMD’s Could Change With New Bill Required minimum distribution requirements are designed to make sure retirees don’t hold money in tax-deferred retirement accounts — such as 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) — for too long. There is an RMD table that gives a life expectancy factor for each year telling how much of the money in an account a retiree is required to withdraw for that year. The equation is simple — simply divide the total money in your account by the life expectancy factor and you have your required withdrawal for the year. For example, in the current table, the life expectancy factor for age 74 is 25.5. If you have $100,000 in your account the year you turn 75, simply divide $100,000 by 25.5 and you’ll see your required withdrawal for that year is approximately $3,921. Previously, you were required to start taking withdrawals from your IRA or employer-sponsored retirement plan when you reached age 70.5. But the 2019 SECURE Act made a critical change to when RMDs begin. If you reached age 70.5 in 2019, the prior rule applied and you had to take your first RMD by April 1, 2020. Yet if you reached age 70.5 in 2020 or later you must now take your first RMD by April 1 of the year after you reach 72. If the new Securing a Strong Retirement Act — commonly known as the SECURE Act 2.0 — is passed, the age when RMDs begin would further shift to 74 in 2029 and 75 in 2032. With people living and working longer, pushing back when they have to start taking money from their retirement accounts allows them to build more wealth and save longer. Other Changes This Bill Could Provide This isn’t the only change that the SECURE Act 2.0 could bring for retirees. Other possible actions include: Mandating automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans. Currently, many employers offer a 401(k) plan but do not automatically enroll their employees in it, making them opt in. This change would make it so employers were required to have automatic enrollment and force employees who don’t want to participate to opt out. There would also automatically increase the amount an employee contributes annually up to 10%. Increase catch up contribution limits from $6,500 for 401(k) plans and $1,000 for IRAs to $10,000 for workers between ages 62 and 64. Savers over a certain age are able to contribute more than the limit to their retirement plans. This would increase that overage. Link the catch-up contribution limit to inflation so it increases over time. Allow employers to provide a 401(k) match for student loan payments. This would be an additional perk companies could offer young workers and would allow them to save more money while still paying off their loans. Reduce the RMD penalty. Currently, someone who fails to take out their RMD is penalized 50% of what they should have withdrawn. The bill would reduce that to 25% or 10% if fixed quickly. The Bottom Line The age at which retirees are required to start withdrawing from their retirement accounts was recently raised to 72. A new bill that may pass this year would raise it even more, eventually ending up at 75. The bill would take several other actions as well, all designed to make it easier for workers to save for retirement.
