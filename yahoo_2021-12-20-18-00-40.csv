12/20/2021,"Flying cars, also known as electric air taxis, have been around us for a long time thanks to sci-fi staples such as “Back to the Future” and “The Jetsons.” But with major brands like Boeing (NYSE:BA), Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF), Hyundai, and Toyota (NYSE:TM) now promising to whisk riders through the skies in flying taxis and receiving a heady dose of Wall Street endorsement, the dream is increasingly getting closer to reality. Indeed, many experts are now upbeat that air mobility over short distances is closer to becoming a reality than ever before in history, thanks mainly to massive advancements in battery technologies and autonomous flight. And make no mistake about it: Flying taxis have real potential to completely restructure public and private transportation, decongest our roads, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, a Morgan Stanley Research study says the autonomous urban aircraft market will continue to mature during the current decade and then boom globally to reach $1.5 trillion by 2040. This year, we have witnessed two electric aircraft startups go public: Joby Aviation Inc. (NYSE:JOBY), which went public in August, and Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE:ACHR), which was listed in September, both via SPAC deals. And, it appears there’s no shortage of electric aircraft companies in the IPO pipeline: Amazon and UPS-backed Beta Technologies have developed Alia, an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, or “eVTOL,” helicopter-like aircraft that can take off and land without runways. Source: Forbes Cargo Plane However, unlike competitors like Joby, Archer, or Larry Page’s Kitty Hawk, Alia is designed primarily as a cargo plane with the company and its investors betting that the business for speeding e-commerce to and from suburban warehouses will mature long before air taxis are considered safe to criss-cross the skies over city streets. “We’re actually going to win at the passenger game because by the time others are doing passenger missions we will have thousands of aircraft, millions of flight hours and a safe, reliable, vetted design,” company founder and CEO Kyle Clark has told Forbes. Alia’s bulbous cabin is designed to accommodate 600 pounds of payload, including the pilot, for a maximum 250 nautical miles, or up to 1,250 pounds for 200 miles with one of the five battery packs removed. That’s at least 100 miles farther than any competitor can currently manage, though Clark expects the FAA to restrict flights to 125 miles. Related: U.S. Onshore Gas Flaring Falls To Lowest Level Since 2012 Clark envisions Alia flying directly from one UPS warehouse to another, thus cutting out truck trips as well as plane flights, and eventually straight to large customers. That will require a radical remodeling of the current hub and spoke delivery network patterns that cargo planes typically use. The CEO reckons that frequent flying will allow up to 90% savings on fuel and cheaper maintenance due to the fewer parts of electric propulsion systems, plus another 35% reduction on operating expenses when fully autonomous flying becomes a reality. If that sounds a tad ambitious, it’s because Beta is developing another disruptive, parallel business: building charging stations for electric aircraft of all types. Beta has already built nine such stations in a line from Vermont to Arkansas, with another 51 under construction or in the permitting process. Most will store banks of used Alia batteries after their capacity has declined about 8%. This will give the startup a profitable second life when the company sells Alia owners replacement packs at about a half a million a pop. Clark’s plan is for them to fill slowly at off-peak times, with excess power sold back at peak to utilities. “The aircraft is the sexy part but we’re going to make big money off batteries,” Clark has gushed. While these lines of business sound impressive, another big reason why Beta Technologies is attracting so much attention can be chalked up to its well-heeled investors. Beta counts Amazon and Fidelity Management as early investors, while angel investor Martine Rothblatt who helped fund Sirius Satellite and United Therapeutics, chipped in with a $52 million seed fund. Beta has also won significant pre-orders: UPS has inked a letter of intent to buy up to 150 Alia aircraft, at $4-$5 million apiece, with delivery for the first ten aircraft slated for 2024. Rothblatt, inspired by her daughter’s lung ailment, has ordered 60 aircraft and eight charging stations from Beta to help deliver perishable organs quickly to hospital helipads. Beta has also won contracts worth $43.6 million to test out Alia for military use after becoming the first electric aircraft to win airworthiness approval from the Air Force for manned flight in May. Beta Technologies, which was valued at $1.4B after its latest round of funding in May, is being compared to another Amazon-backed EV startup that recently topped a valuation of $100B: Rivian Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN). “They see a lot of parallels between Beta and Rivian,” says Edward Eppler, Beta CFO and a former Goldman Sachs investment banker. Related: Russia Puts The Blame On Europe As Energy Crisis Worsens There’s no word yet when Beta Technologies might go public, but the chances are that it will avoid joining the SPAC bandwagon and instead opt for a traditional IPO. SPACs are blank check companies with no products, revenue, or profits that are formed specifically to make acquisitions with the intention of later taking these companies public. There are a number of benefits to a SPAC merger, including a faster timeline (months versus more than a year for an IPO), lower costs because there are fewer bank and underwriter fees, and, crucially (for some companies) less regulatory oversight. The last few years has seen a spate of EVs including Nikola Corp. (NASDAQ:NKLA) and Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) go public via SPACs. However, these deals have rapidly gone out of favor after criminal charges were launched against Nikola’s founder and a warning from the SEC about companies misleading investors in SPAC deals. It’s one of the main reasons why SPACs are getting increased scrutiny from regulators. Indeed, the IPOX SPAC Index, a mix of 50 SPACs and De-SPACs, has crashed 33% since its February peak.

12/20/2021,"(Bloomberg) -- Monday’s Asia trading session took on a decisively risk-off tone: U.S. stock index futures fell, Treasuries gained and risk-sensitive currencies slid as investors fretted over fresh lockdowns to slow the new variant. Most Read from Bloomberg South Africa Hospitalization Rate Plunges in Omicron Wave Biden to Issue ‘Stark Warning’ on Vaccination Amid Covid Surge England Has Hundreds of Thousands of New Omicron Cases Daily Stocks, Futures Sink on Virus, Manchin Shock: Markets Wrap Europe Braces for More Covid Restrictions as U.S. Holds Off Senator Joe Manchin’s rejection of the U.S. spending package at the heart of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda heaped fresh fuel to the fire with market liquidity starting to thin as Christmas nears. “Markets this week and next will be for day traders with steely nerves and deep pockets, not for trend followers,” Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific Pte, said in a note. “As I have repeatedly said, the winner in December is V for volatility.” March contracts on the Nasdaq 100 slid 1.5% as of 3:30 p.m. in Singapore as investors ditched risk-sensitive assets. The selloff was exacerbated as traders in Europe came online, with Euro Stoxx 50 futures slumping 2.7%. Bonds gained, with 10-year U.S. Treasury yields slipping four points to 1.36%. The safe-haven yen advanced against every Group-of-10 currency, and gold climbed. Asian stocks fell alongside U.S. futures, with benchmark indexes down in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, while India’s Sensex index looked poised to enter a correction. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index tumbled as much as 1.9% to trade at its lowest in 13 months amid lower volumes, with about 25 billion shares on the gauge traded Monday at the time of writing, about 75% of the daily average this year. And the rush for havens looks to have room to run. Hedge funds have become the least bearish on the yen in nine months, with JPMorgan Asset Management noting demand for the currency could rise into the year’s end if virus concerns mount. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its forecast for U.S. economic growth in the wake of Manchin’s move against the Biden administration’s roughly $2 trillion tax-and-spend program. Goldman slashed its real gross domestic product projection for the first quarter to 2% from 3% previously. The backdrop of monetary-stimulus tapering in major economies is also adding to trouble for developing-nation assets. The removal of accommodative monetary policy by many major central banks “will hit emerging-markets hard”, along with other risk assets that are dependent on plentiful liquidity, according to Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. “EM is likely to remain under pressure as we move into 2022.” Every developing-market currency except the yuan has weakened against the greenback over the past six months. The Turkish lira, which has been under pressure after President Recep Erdogan flagged an economic model that relies on lower borrowing costs, slid to an all-time low on Monday. In stocks, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index has slid more than 7% this year while the MSCI World Index is up more than 16%. On Friday, the S&P 500 gauge extended its weekly slide in a session of heavy trading volume. With the holidays fast approaching, it could have been the last day of 2021 with enough liquidity for investors to trade in and out of large positions. “Unless we see this flow turn around then it feels like we could be at the mercy of position squaring, rather than chasing, and longs taking some off the table ahead of the calendar year-end,” Chris Weston, head of research with Pepperstone Financial Pty Ltd., wrote in a note to clients.

12/20/2021,"Earnings season is well past its peak, but there are still some interesting quarterly reports to pore over. After Monday’s session closes (Dec 20), Micron (MU) will step up to deliver the November quarter’s (F1Q22) financials. Micron has plenty of support on Wall Street, but none are as bullish as Rosenblatt’s Hans Mosesmann, who expects the memory giant to put on a strong display. “We see the November quarter being driven by strength across the board, including in data center, mobile, PC, and auto, as well as better than expected bit shipment and pricing trends for both DRAM and NAND,” the 5-star analyst said. Mosesmann anticipates the quarter’s sales and non-GAAP EPS will come in higher than both his and the Street’s forecast of $7.65 billion/$7.65 billion and $2.10/$2.11, respectively. As always with Micron, it’s all about DRAM and NAND, and Mosesmann believes there was “better than expected pricing in both.” For DRAM, with “industry dynamics” on the up there has been strong demand for mobile (MCP revenue), notebooks (graphics are in high demand), PCs (new CPU architectures include Micron products), and servers. There has also been an improvement in Enterprise demand, and the “continued adoption” of cloud, AI, and machine-learning. With supply remaining tight in NAND, Mosesmann expects to see strong demand too. Looking ahead to the February quarter, Mosesmann expects will by a low single-digit sequential increase while the Street expects a mid-single digit drop. Mosesmann’s non-GAAP EPS estimate of $2.29 is also above the consensus calls for $1.86. The analyst expects Micron’s guide to be in-line with his forecast. Based on “continued global DRAM tightness, a stronger than expected NAND environment, and overall ASP tailwinds,” Mosesmann says he is “comfortable” with his estimates. In fact, the analyst gives short shrift to one currently held opinion. “We do not subscribe to the absurd notion that bit demand decelerates below supply in 2022 (necessary for the bear case to work), and believe bit demand will continue to be >23% as historical scaling to logic growth would inform us,” the analyst summed up. It’s no surprise to learn then that Mosesmann rates MU shares a Buy along with a Street-high $165 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of a plentiful 99%. (To watch Mosesmann’s track record, click here) What does the rest of the Street think? Looking at the consensus breakdown, opinions from other analysts are more spread out. 6 Buys, 2 Holds and 1 Sell add up to a Moderate Buy consensus. In addition, the $28 average price target indicates 25% upside potential.

12/20/2021,"There are different ways to interpret the market breadth such as measuring the stocks above 200-Day average as shown in the post on divergence between the market breadth and SPX, or determining the overall net 52-Week high/low in the stock market, which you will find out more in detail shortly. In 2018 after a change of character occurred in Jan, a trading range was formed in S&P 500 between 2530-2880. After a failed breakout in Oct, S&P 500 had a sharp pullback of around 11% off the peak (as highlighted in orange in the chart). During this pullback, the market breadth (as highlighted in orange in the lower pane) broke below the 0 level by a large magnitude. Subsequently, S&P 500 consolidated in a trading range between 2600-2800 while the market breadth failed to climb back above the 0 level, suggested that there were more stocks broke below 52-Week low than broke above 52-Week high. This was the key when judging the health in the stock market. The stock market was given multiple chances to recover during the consolidation yet it failed to perform without committing above the 0 level as shown in the market breadth chart. This was an obvious market weakness because there were more bearish stocks than the bullish stocks. After close to 2 months of consolidation with market breadth below 0 level, S&P 500 eventually had a sharp selloff in Dec. In 2020 there was an abrupt pullback in S&P 500 off the all-time high level triggered by the COVID-19 news while the market breadth flipped to below the 0 level with a large magnitude. Similar to 2018’s, the market breadth failed to rally back above the 0 level after the first leg down. This was where things turned sour as S&P 500 had a sharp drop just within 3 weeks after the inability to rally up in the market breadth. Another thing to pay attention to is the direction of WTI crude oil (CL) because it has a very high correlation with the S&P 500 where it also crashed in 2018 and 2020 together with the broad market index. Check out my recent weekly live session video for free where I analyzed the seasonality of crude oil and the price volume analysis with an analogue to refer to. In Nov 2021, the market breadth had another sharp drop below the 0 level with a large magnitude similar to 2018’s and 2020’s, yet S&P 500 is just 3 % away from the all-time high. After the drop in Nov, there was an attempt to rally above 0 level in the market breadth with almost immediate rejection. This is similar to 2018’s scenario but with a stronger S&P 500. This is mainly because of the weightage in S&P 500’s components (similar to Nasdaq 100). Refer to the price volume analysis on 5 of these heavy weight stocks. When these stocks fail to hold, S&P 500 will start to crack. In this bifurcated market, one could trade in either direction with care as it is expected to have high volatility in both directions. A break below 4600 should trigger more selling in S&P 500 to test the swing low at 4500. I will share more on the tactics for both long and short trades in this current volatile market in my weekly live session on Sunday.

12/20/2021,"If your idea of a diversified portfolio is one that only needs growth and value stocks, it’s a good thing you’re reading this. With prominent investors like Michael Burry, Jeremy Grantham and Charlie Munger expecting a historic correction to hit the stock market, it’s an opportune time to take a long, thoughtful look at your portfolio. Specifically, you need to make sure it holds the kinds of assets that can help offset any potential losses associated with your stock market exposure. Let’s look at five assets that can help grow your portfolio, even in the midst of market chaos. We’ll start with three traditional asset classes and then dig into two overlooked examples that show just how interesting — and profitable — alternative investments can be. When inflation is making short work of fixed-income returns, bonds can seem even less attractive than usual. But elevated inflation won’t be around forever, and if the stock market truly is in for a reckoning, the guaranteed income associated with bonds, modest as it is, may be easier to stomach than a historic decline in share values. In addition to the lower risk, investors also opt for bonds at times of economic uncertainty because decreases in consumer spending can lead to weakening profits and lower share prices. The bond market is vast, so you should be able to find products that meet your needs as an investor. U.S. savings bonds, mortgage-backed securities and emerging market bonds are a few examples. And getting exposure is now as easy as purchasing established bond ETFs such as the iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF, SPDR Long Term Corporate Bond ETF, and VanEck Investment Grade Floating Rate ETF. Real estate is detached from the stock market to such an extent that it provides one of the best hedges against falling share prices. There hasn’t been a period in recent American history where millions of people weren’t willing to pay for shelter, either by renting or buying properties of their own. Demand for housing may fluctuate from neighborhood to neighborhood, but its overall ceaselessness should continue to push prices and rent higher, no matter what’s happening on Wall Street. Purchasing an investment property — a condo, a detached home, a triplex — is the ideal for most investors. Others are happy to keep updating their own residence with an eye toward a future sale. You can also purchase shares in a real estate investment trust, or REIT, which distributes rental income to shareholders. Names like Realty Income, Digital Realty Trust, and Public Storage should provide a good starting point for investors who'd like to investigate the space. Commodities can help shield your portfolio from a declining stock market, but they come with their own unique risks. When investing in commodities, you’re buying the raw materials used to produce consumer goods and reselling them at (hopefully) a higher price. Cotton, coffee, metals, cattle and petroleum products all qualify as commodities. Commodity prices are a reflection of supply and demand dynamics in individual markets, so their performance isn’t tied to the stock market. Commodities tend to have a low to negative correlation to both stocks and bonds. That said, commodities investing is inherently volatile. Unfavorable weather could ruin an investment in chickpeas; new regulations could kill your investment in coal. But if everything falls into place, the returns can be great. These days, a practical way to invest in commodities is through well-established, broad-based commodity ETFs, such as the Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund. If you want to invest in a specific commodity, there are ETFs for that too. For instance, gold bugs have long loved the SPDR Gold Shares ETF for easy access to the market. Meanwhile, gold mining companies like Barrick Gold and Newmont should also do well if the price of the yellow metal goes up. Like commodities, art values depend on supply and demand; it’s just that supply, when it comes to art, means a one-of-a-kind display of genius — something people regularly pay millions for. In addition to being uncorrelated with the stock market, fine art has the ability to kick off healthy returns. Between 1995 and 2020, contemporary art has outperformed the S&P 500 by 174% — that’s nearly three times the returns — according to the Citi Global Art Market chart. Fine art used to be an investment for wealthy aficionados with access to the capital and insight required to make smart purchases. But new platforms are helping everyday investors get into the fine art market by selling shares in modern masterpieces that could one day be sold for solid gains. “Those artists tend to appreciate at single-digit to low-double-digit rates, but they're very good stores of value,” says Scott Lyn, CEO of art investing platform Masterworks. “It's very unlikely that you lose money investing in one of those paintings.” In the same investable, collectible vein as fine art lie sports cards, some of which can be worth a fortune. In October, a rare Michael Jordan Upper Deck card was auctioned off for $2.7 million. Earlier this year, a Tom Brady rookie card was sold for $2.25 million. Social media and a whole lot of pandemic-related free time spent digging through old collections have helped trigger a new wave of interest in sports cards. They’re like a meme stock alternative — they don’t always pay off, but when they do, look out. You can play the sports card game in many ways: Buy individual cards you think will maintain their value. Buy boxes of cards and go hunting for one-of-a-kind items that can sell for ridiculous amounts. Pool your money with other investors to purchase high value cards and resell them at some point in the future. Find a broker who, for a fee, will help you buy, sell and trade sports cards like stocks. Just be careful. The bottom fell out of the sports card market in the mid-90s — too many companies, too many cards. With all the money the space is attracting today, expect more companies to try and get a piece of it. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

12/20/2021,"The race to deploy 5G infrastructure has unlocked a new use for the rooftops of restaurants, hotels, residential buildings, and even hospitals and churches. These rooftops are quickly becoming prime real estate targets for telecommunication leaders eager to establish 5G technology in highly populated areas. In fact, next-generation wireless deployments are positioned to be one of the largest allocators of lease revenue in the United States over the next five years, creating a seismic opportunity for landlords and other business owners. The Biden administration has made expanding the country’s 5G infrastructure a national priority. The $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package earmarks $65 billion in funding to expand broadband coverage to rural and underserved communities. Despite its speed and power relative to other wireless technologies, 5G has a much shorter range, only reaching up to about 1,500 feet. 5G technology is uniquely suited to deployment on existing building rooftops because of the reduced antenna heights for the next-generation wireless network. In addition to the major wireless communications providers, new entrants in the 5G deployment race include traditional cable companies and Big Tech firms. Together, these companies are forecasted to invest an additional $275 billion to deploy their 5G macro and small-cell sites. The only effective and efficient way to deploy the sheer quantity of deployment sites required is to leverage existing buildings. In other words, the solution to the 5G race is to adopt a rooftop deployment strategy. Historically, the wireless communications market has been challenging to navigate for real estate and other business owners. Wireless carriers and tower companies have in the past entered into long-term agreements that often were less than advantageous to the property owner. In many communities, there’s strong opposition to building new towers and, moreover, the construction, zoning and permitting process can be time-consuming. However, 5G technology is uniquely suited to deployment on existing building rooftops because of the reduced antenna heights for the next-generation wireless network. Now, major institutional commercial real estate owners are better positioned than tower operators for carriers to achieve a faster, more efficient solution for their wireless real estate requirements. A rooftop deployment strategy presents a solution that is mutually beneficial to the 5G carrier and the property owner. Carriers achieve their objective of deploying their infrastructure as quickly as possible in heavily trafficked areas, while property owners reap the financial benefits of leasing their rooftops and monetizing their existing buildings in new ways. The impact on the net operating income for real estate owners and the revenue generated over the terms of a potentially 30-year lease can be substantial, increasing their access to capital. In addition to collecting payments in return for leasing its rooftop to the carrier, landlords are also able to provide better services to tenants with high-speed broadband connectivity. The deployment of 5G infrastructure is critically important for the United States to keep pace and remain competitive internationally. Certainly, 5G is about faster connectivity, increased capacity and zero latency, but it’s mostly about driving innovation that will enable a range of business services from autonomous vehicles and expansion of telehealth to efficiencies in manufacturing and agriculture and improved supply chain management. With all of these benefits considered, 5G is expected to contribute over $1.5 trillion to the U.S. GDP by 2025. The Biden administration has also identified 5G technology and universal broadband as an economic equalizer for rural America. According to policy statements, rural Americans are over 10 times more likely to lack access to reliable internet compared to urban residents. In the recently signed infrastructure law, the president and Congress prioritized investments in rural broadband infrastructure to bridge that digital divide, expanding internet access to these underserved areas. Because of this emphasis, landlords with properties in rural areas could stand to benefit more from the expansion of 5G infrastructure. The path to establishing a strong 5G network across the United States will be a long one. While it need not be a deterrent, property owners partnering with 5G providers and wireless carriers should also be informed and cognizant of the cybersecurity considerations of the technology as they house the infrastructure and offer the wireless network to their tenants. In a recent Aon survey of more than 2,300 risk managers and other executives, cyber risk was listed as the No. 1 current and predicted future risk globally. Increased connectivity and 5G are the future, which means the cybersecurity industry must continue to innovate and expand its use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance defenses. We’ve also seen the creation of organizations such as Building Cyber Security to help provide guidance and a framework to improve cybersecurity resiliency in the real estate sector. For property owners to effectively monetize their rooftops and participate in the race to 5G, government and private industry must continue to work collaboratively on an expeditious deployment of 5G infrastructure, including timely review of 5G installation requests. Additionally, more work is necessary at the state and local levels to improve the zoning and permitting process for the deployment of 5G antennas. Numerous state legislatures are already considering legislation to better address and develop a 5G strategy for their constituencies, which would also provide new opportunities for landlords. There is more policy and technical work to be done to fuel the race to 5G, but the revenue opportunity for property owners is immediate and tangible. For restaurateurs or hoteliers rebounding from the economic slowdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, monetizing their rooftops could be the difference between shuttering their storefronts and turning a profit.",Business/TechCrunch•2 days ago,Rooftops for rent: Property owners should partner with 5G carriers,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rooftops-rent-property-owners-partner-151203039.html

12/20/2021,"(Bloomberg) -- Bond traders suspect the Federal Reserve will quickly discover it’s being too ambitious with its newly hawkish stance. Most Read from Bloomberg South Africa Hospitalization Rate Plunges in Omicron Wave Biden to Issue ‘Stark Warning’ on Vaccination Amid Covid Surge England Has Hundreds of Thousands of New Omicron Cases Daily Stocks, Futures Sink on Virus, Manchin Shock: Markets Wrap Europe Braces for More Covid Restrictions as U.S. Holds Off The Federal Open Market Committee just forecast overnight rates jumping from zero currently to 1.60% and 2.10% by year-end 2023 and 2024, respectively. Traders see it differently, with eurodollar futures contracts pricing in 1.50% short-term rates on both dates. The concern is that the economy won’t be able to handle the loftier rates policy makers have in mind, which limits how far central bankers can raise interest rates and how high Treasury yields can go. “There is an elevated risk of a policy mistake,” said Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co., which has $2.2 trillion of assets. “The Fed is in a difficult position.” There’s a risk “inflation stays higher for longer” than many expect, he added. The yield on the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond has fallen to around 1.81% from this year’s peak of 2.51% in March, while the 10-year is at 1.40%. Long-term yields have come down as traders priced in the start of what they see as a quick-yet-shallow cycle of Fed rate increases. As a result, the gap between 5- and 30-year yields has plunged to 63 basis points from a multi-year high of 167 basis points in February. Next week, the bond market will be closed on Friday in observance of Christmas, and trading will wrap up early -- at 2 p.m. New York time -- the day before. Assuming trading desks -- ones in offices, or work-from-home ones as omicron spreads -- are thinly staffed leading up to then, there could be some volatility. “The holiday-shortened week creates the perfect environment for choppy price action exacerbated by volume and balance sheet constraints,” BMO Capital Markets strategists Ian Lyngen and Benjamin Jeffery wrote in a note. Treasury auctions could potentially stir things up. There will be a reopening sale of 20-year bonds, which have been plagued by tepid demand. In addition, the Treasury Department will hold a reopening sale of 5-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities -- whose yields have been on a wild ride lately as investors fiddle with their inflation projections. Treasury auctions in recent months have been a catalyst for jolts in yields. The Bloomberg Treasury index has returned minus 2.1% for 2021, the first annual drop since 2013’s loss of 2.75%. Meanwhile, a separate Bloomberg index of Treasuries with maturities of 10 years or more has lost 4.5% this year through Dec. 16. “The behavior of the long-end will constrain how far the Fed goes, as they will not want to risk inverting the curve,” said James McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust Investments. “One risk for investors next year is a Fed inflation pivot that results in excessive tightening of financial conditions.” What to Watch The economic calendar: Dec. 20: Leading index Dec. 21: Current account balance Dec. 22: MBA mortgage applications; Chicago Fed national activity index; GDP; personal consumption; core PCE; Conference Board consumer confidence; existing home sales Dec. 23: Personal income; jobless claims; personal spending; PCE deflator; durable goods orders; Langer Consumer Comfort; University of Michigan consumer sentiment; new home sales The Fed calendar is empty The auction calendar: Dec. 20: 13-, 26-week bills; 78-day cash management bills Dec. 21: 20-year bond reopening Dec. 22: 5-year TIPS reopening Dec. 23: 4-, 8-week bills Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek How McDonald’s Made Enemies of Black Franchisees A Fight to Die How to Have a Perfect Work-From-Home Friday A Wild, Emotional Year Has Changed Investing—Maybe Forever Tesla Takes Customers to Court to Silence Its Critics in China ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,The Bond Market Isn’t Buying Fed’s Sketch of Rate Hike Plans,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bond-market-isn-t-buying-190047215.html

12/20/2021,"“What’s your salary range?” It’s a question that can cause even the most seasoned interviewee to panic. Suddenly, you’re caught off guard, hemming and hawing and wondering how to respond professionally and not shortchange yourself the compensation you know you deserve. We checked in with three hiring managers to find out exactly how to approach this dreaded query and how to answer if (and when) it comes up. Whether it’s the first interview or the fifth, always assume that salary could be a talking point. Prepare yourself by having a clear (and research-backed) understanding of your expectations in regard to a range. “The number you give should encapsulate three things,” says Chandra Turner, CEO of Ed2010 and Talent Fairy, a career website and recruitment agency for media professionals. “You need to know what you want or need to get paid to keep or improve your lifestyle, but also the comparative rates in the industry you’re looking at (say, technology) and also for the role itself (say, product manager).” To figure out the first part, look at your current or most recent salary. Are you happy with it? Do you need to make more in order to afford your lifestyle? For the second part, check out online resources and calculators. “Salary.com lists salaries for all kinds of jobs and now allows you to search by industry, then the role. Glassdoor also provides pretty detailed information. Some companies now even fill in the range on their LinkedIn postings. Just be sure you check,” Turner adds. Last, she advises talking to your peers in the industry for final insight on the going rate. “It’s as simple as asking, ‘What’s the market rate for someone in X role?’ Perhaps they’ve hired someone in that position personally or have previously worked in that role. That way they can answer without getting too personal—although I’m also a big proponent of just flat out putting it out there since it helps others learn how to value their own work.” Remember that you don’t always need to give a number. “If there is a box where you can type an answer, it’s completely acceptable to put the word negotiable,” says Maria Dunn, head of people and culture at Managed by Q, a company that builds tools for workplaces that help improve the office experience. If the conversation is taking place in person and you are in the beginning stages, it’s fine to answer the question with a question, like “What is budgeted for the role?” “At Q, we are typically very up front with what we are willing to offer since open roles have to be approved by our finance team in advance,” Dunn says. The interview process is a learning opportunity for both sides, and just because you write down a certain number or range at the outset, that doesn’t mean you’re married to it, says Turner. “After you learn more about the role, you can always ask for a higher salary by saying, ‘Now that I have a better understanding of the responsibilities for this position, I feel that $X is more in line with what I would like to make in this role,’” she explains. One caveat: “Just be sure you don’t throw this out during the offer stage. You’ll want to update your ask with the hiring manager or recruiter after your first interview or whenever you realize that the role is worth more than your initial guess.” Many states—including New York and California—prohibit companies from asking a candidate to share their current compensation, according to Jennifer Ruza, SVP of the people and experience team at VaynerMedia. She explains, “As a result, in many cases, organizations have done away with asking for salary requirements and have shifted the narrative to say, ‘The position is budgeted for a range of $X. Is that within what you’re looking for?’” This may not be the case across the board, but it’s worth keeping in mind as you go through the interview process. According to Dunn, if you’re answering with a number, you are going to have to justify it. “For an in-person conversation, when the salary question comes up, say, ‘Based on my research on compensation for a role like this and a company at your stage and size, I would expect to be in the $75,000 to $80,000 range, considering I have X years of experience and I’m confident I’d be able to hit the ground running. That said, I’m very interested in this position and the total compensation package is what is most important to me. I look forward to hearing the details on that as well.’” Turner adds, “I think it can be dangerous to overinflate yourself. If you are currently making $60,000 but your research shows that the market rate for your role (or the one you want to move in to) is closer to $75,000, then go ahead and ask for $75,000. But if you were to ask for $90,000, which is 20 percent more, chances are they wouldn’t call you in because they have plenty of candidates in the $70,000 to 80,000 range already. Of course, you don’t want to leave money on the table, but you also need to be at the table to begin with. That’s why doing your research is so important.” RELATED: Open Salary Policies at the Office Are Trending—But Is It a Good Idea?",Business/PureWow•22 hours ago,How to Answer the Dreaded ‘What’s Your Salary Range?’ Question in a Job Interview,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/answer-dreaded-salary-range-job-110000635.html
12/20/2021,"Stablecoins are increasingly being taken seriously as a potential part of the U.S. financial system, though how the digital assets should be regulated is still being debated by officials and industry leaders. “Stablecoins can certainly be a useful, efficient, consumer-serving part of the financial system if they’re properly regulated,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said at the Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC) press conference on Wednesday. ""And right now, they aren’t."" As of Nov. 10, the top four stablecoins — tether (USDT-USD), USD coin, Binance USD (BNB-USD), and DAI — commanded a market value of $128 billion. “They have the potential to scale, particularly if they were to be associated with one of the very large tech networks that exist,” Powell added. “You could have a payment network that was immediately, systemically important that didn’t have appropriate regulation and protections. The public relies on the government and the Fed, in particular, to make sure that the payment system is safe and reliable, as well as the dollar, to provide a safe and reliable trusted currency.” Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are usually backed by a reserve asset. This secondary asset helps the currency maintain price stability, unlike other forms of cryptocurrency — such as bitcoin (BTC-USD) — that can see high levels of volatility and more extreme swings in prices day-to-day. As a result, stablecoins can be useful as a store of value or medium of exchange. And because they work through the blockchain, they can move very rapidly between peers without having to go through the kinds of intermediaries that slow down traditional bank transfers. Many of the most popular stablecoins, like tether and USD coin, are pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, cash equivalents, or other assets like gold. Other stablecoins are backed by cryptocurrencies. MakerDAO's DAI, for instance, is tied to ethereum (ETH-USD). Some stablecoins are non-collateralized, meaning they are not backed by any other asset. Instead, they rely on an algorithm that runs autonomously to monitor the supply and demand of the coin, much like a central bank does when printing banknotes, to retain a stable price. Many see the applications of stablecoins fitting into existing payment systems. And some payment platforms, such as Circle, have issued their own stablecoins. At the same time, as Powell stressed, stablecoins are largely unregulated. That means that issuers can hold other assets that may or may not redeem a coin's value and may even introduce leverage, thereby increasing risk. In other words, while stablecoins are seen as safe havens in the crypto world, their actual value may be somewhat more inscrutable. Tether is one notable example of this. Created in 2014, the popular stablecoin was designed to track one-to-one with the dollar. However, just 5% of tether's holdings are in cash. Its reserves are comprised largely of commercial paper (a form of short-term corporate debt), gold, and bonds, leading some market participants to doubt its stability. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, told Yahoo Finance earlier this week that he would like to see stablecoins brought under banking rules.  At the same time, he's open-minded about how regulation would play out. “Right now,"" Brown noted, ""the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, and the Department of Treasury are all looking at what we do about stablecoins generally."" Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), a top ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, also told Yahoo Finance that regulating stablecoins could offer an entryway into regulating cryptocurrencies more broadly. “We need to have, at the federal level, changes in law in order for stablecoins to be in the marketplace,” McHenry told Yahoo Finance earlier this month. How exactly that regulation would actually play out is the big question going forward. On Wednesday, Powell noted that he ""would support the views expressed"" in a report by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, which called on Congress to develop a framework that would regulate stablecoin issuers much like traditional banks. Other officials see it differently. “I understand the attraction of forcing a new product into an old, familiar structure,” Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said in November. “But that approach and mindset would eliminate a key benefit of a stablecoin arrangement — that it serves as a viable competitor to banking organizations in their role as payment providers.""

12/20/2021,"With Christmas around the corner and federal student loans switching on next month, money stress is reaching a peak for many young people — and it’s been bad for a while. Nearly three in four Americans under 40 say managing their finances is taking a toll on their mental health, according to a new survey from Laurel Road, KeyBank’s digital banking platform. Over 60% feel “constantly stressed.” “Financial stress and anxiety are incredibly common feelings among Gen Z and millennials,” says Alyssa Schaefer, general manager and chief experience officer at Laurel Road. “We see that cultivating ‘mental wealth’ is clearly a priority for many individuals.” That means building more financial knowledge and setting up a financial plan so you can feel confident about the future. Here are five ways to achieve those goals: While you may not be able to eliminate your student debt or credit card debt anytime soon, you can relieve a lot of pressure by getting them in the most manageable shape possible. If you have a federal student loan, the government offers income-driven repayment plans that allow borrowers to make more affordable payments, based on what they earn. After you make 20 or 25 years of regular payments under an income-driven plan, your remaining debt will be forgiven. Another simple money-saving step is to enroll in autopay, because signing up for automatic deposits will qualify you for a 0.25% interest rate reduction when payments resume. On the other hand, if you have a private loan, your best bet could be refinancing with one of today’s cheap interest rates. Assuming you have a decent credit score, refinancing could help you pay off your loan more quickly and save you a huge amount in interest. The same strategy can work for any high-interest debt you’re carrying, like the kind on credit cards. Refinancing to a lower rate could see you free yourself years sooner. About two-thirds of millennials and Gen Zers are concerned about overspending during the holiday season, but only 38% are actually budgeting. Consider talking to your loved ones about swapping homemade gifts, like baked goods or crafts, or agree to skip the gifts and simply share the pleasure of each other’s company. You’ll probably find some of your friends and relatives are tight on money, as well. If you are buying gifts, remember you can download a free browser add-on that will automatically hunt for lower prices and coupons when you shop online. Even after 2021 comes to a close, a monthly budget can be a great money- and stress-management tool. Dig out a notepad and list all of your usual expenses, like groceries, credit card bills, mortgage or rent payments and retirement savings. That way you know exactly how much you can spend on the fun stuff each month, worry-free. If your anxiety comes from imagining the worst-case scenario, like a job loss or running out of money in retirement, then it’s time to prepare for it. About 44% of the respondents in the study say they’re trying hard to save more. However, saving is only part of the picture; you’ll also want to maximize the money you’re saving. Tuck away some savings each month into a high-yield savings account so it has a chance to grow. Normal checking and savings accounts offer next to nothing in interest. Experts suggest keeping enough money on hand for three to six months of expenses, if possible. Knowing you have a secure stash for emergencies like a big medical bill or expensive car repairs can help bring peace of mind. However, you’ll also want to make sure you’re investing for the future — and the best thing you can do is to start early. Even a small amount can grow into a fortune with time, so consider using an app that lets you invest with just your “spare change.” Don’t be afraid to talk to someone if your financial anxiety is spiralling out of control — whether that’s a mental health professional or a financial planner. Building “mental wealth” goes both ways. A good financial planner will examine your situation and help you meet your goals, like planning for retirement, managing investments and dealing with debt. Just keep in mind that they won’t be directly addressing your emotions or trauma regarding money. If you can find one, financial therapists specialize in both mental health and money. They can help you rethink your relationship with money, address your coping behaviors and even assist in coming up with the right spending plan. If your 9-to-5 isn’t generating enough cash for your comfort level, try to take control through other avenues, like starting up a side hustle or investing. It used to be pretty hard to turn a hobby into a genuine money-making side gig, but nowadays digital marketplaces can help you find eager buyers. You can sell all kinds of talents, from writing to drawing to voice acting. Don’t have the extra time to spare? Investing is always an option. Again, you don’t need a bachelor of finance or thousands of dollars to get started. Some investing apps will set up automated portfolios for as little as $1 a month — and even give you money for using them. On the other hand, if you feel confident enough to make decisions on your own, consider using an investing app that charges zero commissions in order to keep your costs low and maximize your profits.
