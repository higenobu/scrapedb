5/7/2022,"There are as many tools filling garden centre aisles as there are jobs to do on your plot. But just as in the kitchen you could ditch a dozen specialist slicing-and-dicing gadgets and replace them with one decent knife, so, too, in the garden you can get by with a minimal amount of versatile gear. And while it is generally sensible to buy the best tools that you can afford, preparing to grow your own need not be costly. The first thing you will need is something to sow seeds in. For years, the industry standard has been lightweight black plastic trays but these are flimsy and usually unrecyclable. Other options such as Fibre Starter Cells (£5.99 for three trays) are biodegradable but tend to dry out quicker and so demand a more attentive watering regime. They also are not likely to last beyond one growing season. A better option might be Natural Rubber Reusable seed trays (from £15.99), which combine decent sustainability credentials with a multiyear lifespan. If a childhood spent watching Blue Peter encouraged you to hoard spent loo and kitchen roll tubes, these can be cut into two-inch sections and used as individual seed modules. As for making holes in your compost in which to plant your seeds, the market is awash with diversely designed dibbers. If you are going to buy one, opt for one with measurements marked along its length, but an old pencil or chopstick is equally effective. No space for a greenhouse? Join the club. But there are more modest options available for giving seeds a good start. Sankey manufactures a two-tray heated propagator (from £27.50), which combines ease of use with affordability. But by mid-May, most seeds will sprout just fine if placed on a warm, sunny windowsill. Once they are ready they can go outside to their final growing place, be that the ground, a raised bed, or a container – which can be anything from a yoghurt pot to an old boot to a stack of tyres, as long as you ensure adequate drainage. For the container gardener or novice grower, most hole-making and weed-pulling jobs can be completed with a hand trowel or hand fork or both. Spear & Jackson is a reliable entry-level brand, and you can pick up a pair of basic tools for about £15. I am a convert to the all-in-one Japanese master blade: the hori hori (from about £20). It is sharp, curved and robust enough for almost any small-scale digging or weeding job. When growing your own produce, all you need is a decent pair of secateurs. You can pick up a pair for pennies from your local pound shop or garden centre – but don’t. You really do get what you pay for. My secateurs of choice are the Okatsune No 103s. These are made of Japanese steel and built to last, with red-and-white handles that help you spot them in an overgrown border. You can find them on sale fairly widely for about £45. I once spent some time on a vineyard on the outskirts of London. The head grower, who at certain times of year has to prune hundreds of seasoned vines every day, swore by his slightly more expensive Felco 12 secateurs (£55.99) with a revolving handle designed to reduce wrist strain. Even the best will eventually lose their lustre – to prolong their shelf life, keep them clean, sharp and well oiled. If the only cutting you are doing in your garden, patio or balcony is harvesting your fruit and veg, then a sharp knife or pair of kitchen scissors will just as easily do the trick. To avoid roughing up your seeds and seedlings, it is best to avoid a mains-pressure garden hose and instead opt for a watering can – ideally one with a fine nozzle to avoid drenching tender plants. I try to limit my use of plastic in the garden but be warned that cheap steel cans have a tendency to corrode. Once they get going, most crops will benefit from a regular feed, and there are lots of pre-packed and pre-bottled options out there, organic and not. But there is a more economical and enjoyable approach to plant nutrition. A worm farm (or wormery or vermicomposter) is basically a small, worm-run compost bin. Food waste and paper scraps go in, the worms do their thing, and the end product is a double whammy offering of compost and nutrient-rich liquid plant feed (AKA worm wee). Worm farms are odour-free, rodent-proof and can be kept indoors or out. I have a French-made WormBox that I keep in a shady corner by the shed. I do most of my gardening in a pair of old open-toed pool slides, which means any outing to water my plants is usually followed by a change out of soggy socks. Garden clogs will not win you any style plaudits (knee pads also fall into this ugly-yet-useful category) but they will at least keep your feet dry. Aigle and Birkenstock have slip-on, closed-toe options.

5/7/2022,"Tom Hiddleston, 41, became a household name as part of the Marvel universe, playing the god of mischief, Loki. Alongside many high-profile film roles, his TV credits include The Hollow Crown and The Night Manager, for which he received two Emmy nominations. In 2021, he began starring in the Disney+ spin-off series Loki. What was it like to make the transition from the big screen to the small screen in your first Marvel spin-off?I was just really honoured to be asked. We all wanted to retain the integrity of the character – I wanted to make sure we didn’t lose the bits that people loved, while doing something new. I also hope Loki coming out as bisexual was meaningful to people who spotted it. It was a small step, and there’s further to go. But it was definitely important to all of us. What would you be doing if you weren’t an actor?I think there would be something very rewarding about teaching. I would teach drama or Shakespeare. Have you ever been mistaken for anybody else?I was mistaken for Michael Fassbender once in New York. The guy who stopped me was really disappointed – it was just so awkward and embarrassing. I said: “I’m sorry to let you down, let’s just both pretend this never happened.” I didn’t tell him I was an actor. What is your TV guilty pleasure?Blackadder. I watched it when I had my tonsils out when I was about 12 or 13 and it really cheered me up. Going back to it now, there’s that nostalgic quality. What do you eat in front of the TV?I don’t eat in front of the TV a lot. But a chocolate digestive with a cup of tea is a winner, especially in the winter. If your life were a TV show, what would the title be?Keep Calm and Carry On [laughs]. Bouncing From Here to There. Or Just Keep Swimming … that’s a line from Finding Nemo, isn’t it? What makes you reach for the remote (to turn the TV off)?Sometimes you just need to ration your news intake. Which isn’t to say that we don’t need to know what’s going on, but you have to have a boundary. Who is the most famous person in your phone contacts?The Avengers. I think they’re pretty well known? Are you Succession’s Team Shiv or Team Tom?I find that relationship excruciatingly painful. It’s a tough call. Do I have to choose one of them? Shiv could have been more considerate and generous to Tom, but you see how brutality is baked into the experience of that family.

5/7/2022,"Maggie Mayhem knows when she decided to become a reproductive rights activist. At around 13 she discovered two conditions in her southern California Catholic girls school’s manual: If a student was found to have had an abortion, they would be expelled, because abortion was against the teaching of the Catholic church. At the same time, the school would not accommodate a student who became pregnant. “It taught me my reproductive system was something I should be afraid of, that it could have negative consequences for my life,” Mayhem says. “I saw: ‘there will be no sympathy for you. And anyone that you talk to about this poses a risk.’” She also saw beautiful things: friends helping friends to the abortion clinic. Teenagers taking care of teenagers, keeping grownups at bay. That solidarity led her to her current line of work. Mayhem – a pseudonym – is just one of many US activists vouching for self-managed abortions outside the gaze of the medical establishment. With a growing slate of abortion restrictions and the recent leak of a supreme court draft opinion indicating justices have already voted to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, activists like Mayhem say such measures aren’t just necessary, they are also better than what’s currently on offer. They are saying: abortion is your right – and you don’t need to depend on doctors or the state for it. When most people think of self-managed abortion, they think of back alleys, coat hangers or throwing oneself down the stairs; of last resorts, despair, shame. But that is no longer the reality. Today, self-managed abortion often means taking pills that are available over the counter in many countries, with little risk of death or serious complications. Other times, it means using herbs, or vacuum aspirators, like the Del-Em (a homemade suction device created by activists in the 70s), under the watchful eye of somebody experienced – like a midwife or a doula – who can advise if things go wrong. Self-managed abortion is not a silver bullet. It carries with it the risk of prosecution, even though it is not illegal in most states. In April, a Texas woman was charged with murder for a self-induced abortion, even though there was no legal basis for the charges – as the district attorney admitted when he dropped the case. And not everybody wants to turn to a clandestine market for their abortion care. Some people feel more comfortable with a licensed practitioner. People want options. But for many, options are fast receding. Those who look outside the medical establishment will find, often through word of mouth, an underground movement of doctors, midwives, doulas and activists – some trained by formal institutions, others by practitioners in the network. They will find those who mostly undertake legal work – sharing information from the World Health Organization about how to use medication to induce an abortion, for example. They’ll also find some who do not – assisting with abortions later down the line, or giving medical advice when things go wrong. “It is not a practitioner’s or a government’s job to give people power,” says Samantha Zipporah, an educator who refers to herself as a traditional midwife – Zipporah is not credentialed. Zipporah says she rejects state regulation of pregnancy care. To her, home-centered abortion care is far from a last resort or a reaction to a changing policy landscape. It’s simply not something that should be dependent on an outside authority.“Throughout history, we have a much greater tradition of our fertility and reproductive capacities being social, spiritual and ecological rather than medical or political,” she explains. “The medical-industrial paradigm, the church, the state – these institutions are set up in a way that requires obedience and submission,” she says. “Our power was never theirs. Our bodies have power.” The advent of medication abortion has made the work of these activists easier – because it is easily available. Medication abortion is safer than Tylenol – resulting in a successful termination 99.6% of the time when used appropriately, with less than a 1% risk of complications, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The safety of other means used outside a clinical setting hasn’t been sufficiently studied, but broadly speaking, existing data from recent years does not show elevated fatality rates from self-managed abortion. The FDA recently allowed people to receive abortion pills by mail, without needing to first visit a medical facility. But states seeking to restrict abortion have required in-person visits or have banned abortion telehealth services outright. That’s just one reason activists want to cut out the middle man. Although the majority of abortions are completed with medication, only 21% of the US public know these pills exist. People can order them online but scam sites are common. So activists use in-person and virtual grassroots networks to share where to buy the pills, how to safely ingest them, what a normal response to them looks like and when to seek help. Crucially, they can explain the legal landscape – after all, if you turn up at the emergency room admitting you tried to cause your own abortion, you could face legal risk. But because medication abortion and complications from it look exactly the same, medically, as a miscarriage – people need not disclose they tried to induce their own abortion. Self-managed abortion can eradicate barriers, even in a world where in-clinic abortions aren’t under attack. It offers privacy: the ability to have an abortion at home, away from protesters, or your community. It may offer cover from an abusive partner. And it means that people who live far away from a clinic, or can’t afford to make the trip, can still access the procedure. “It all comes down to someone assessing their own situation, and being able to make a decision about how to manage their reproductive care. There’s simply no medical reason that abortion pills shouldn’t be over the counter,” says a spokesperson for Mountain Access Brigade, a group that runs an abortion hotline in Appalachia and the south-east. “To make people jump through these hoops: to go to appointments, to have a mandatory ultrasound – these things are designed to humiliate, shame and coerce them into changing their mind,” she adds. “These pills are safer than aspirin. They’re safer than Viagra. We let people manage very complex conditions at home – such as diabetes. And yet these pills are so restricted,” says reproductive rights activist Susan Yanow. “People are afraid of them.” Of course, some doctors worry about self-managed abortions. The abortion pill is considered safe only until 10 weeks. People can still use it effectively up to 14 weeks, but the risk of complications goes up. Doctors worry about people estimating the wrong date of conception; that they may still be pregnant after taking the medication without realizing; or they will experience complications and end up in need of urgent help. “I absolutely worry about people self-managing their abortions,” says Dr Mark Rosing, an obstetrician gynecologist who works in the Bronx, New York. “A patient could hemorrhage, develop a severe infection and even die,” he adds. Rosing was in training in New York in the early 2000s, when he noticed patients in the emergency room talking about taking a “star pill” before miscarriage. They were referring to misoprostol, one of the drugs used to induce a medical abortion, which was not widely available for abortion uses then. He presumes many people used the medication successfully and didn’t end up in the emergency room. But those who did were panicked, scared of how much they were bleeding and sometimes hadn’t successfully evacuated the pregnancy. He understands that in a landscape that looks increasingly likely to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, leading to bans in 26 states, people might not have a choice. “I wouldn’t blame them. People aren’t going to stop trying to get what they need,” he says. Rosing was trained by many doctors who practiced before Roe v Wade, the seminal supreme court decision which established the constitutional right to abortion. His mentors and teachers told him about cases involving self-managed abortion, and the gruesome complications which haunted them. “People came in with perforated uteruses, hemorrhage and severe infections. People lost their uterus and all kinds of things,” he says. “I’m really afraid we’re going back there.” The reality is that self-managed abortions don’t look the same now as pre-Roe. There were 19 deaths related to “illegal” abortions – those not performed by a licensed clinician – in 1973, the year Roe v Wade was decided, according to CDC data. In the last two decades, two people have died from an illegal abortion, while 103 have died from a legal abortion. The comparison is not like-for-like – hundreds of thousands of legal abortions take place every year in the US, whereas the full scale of self-managed abortion is unknown – but the dangers of self-managed abortion may be overstated. “We are more capable of being able to understand our reproductive selves – and to manage that effectively and safely – than we’ve been led to believe,” says Vienna Farlow, a holistic healthcare practitioner. “But the system is set up to say, you’re too dumb to do any of this. And not only are you too dumb, your body doesn’t matter enough for us to even care to tell you how to do it,” she expands. Activists believe much of the stigma around self-managed abortion was caused, in part, by a campaigning technique by the pro-choice movement – when abortion activists would hand out small coat hangers, defending the right to abortion by evoking images of dangerous procedures that are no longer the norm. “That may have been very necessary or appropriate for the time, but it increased the fear of abortion and added a lot more abstract ideas of danger rather than demystifying what abortion is,” Mayhem says. Between 2017 and 2020, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, tried to understand the prevalence, effectiveness and dangers of self-managed abortions – the first ever such study to do so. They asked a random sample of 7,022 women if they had self-managed an abortion in their lifetime and 1.4% responded that they had, leading researchers to predict that something like 7% of all women in the US will self-manage an abortion in their lifetime. The researchers were surprised by the methods women use to induce their own abortions – booze, herbs, pills, even asking a partner to hit them in the abdomen. They thought medication abortion would be more prevalent. These methods were largely ineffective, but also largely not life-threatening. Of 92 participants who said they had tried to manage their own abortions, 27 were effective. Twelve said they experienced complications (defined as something requiring “treatment by a doctor or nurse”). Nobody experienced severe complications. For one in five participants, not being able to locate an abortion clinic, or having to travel too far to get to one, was the reason the person attempted self-management. Forebodingly, the researchers pointed out: “Unprecedented levels of new state-level abortion restrictions … and the potential for a Supreme Court decision that could reshape federal Constitutional protections on abortion, suggest an urgent need to pay close attention to trends in [self-managed abortion] … in the coming years.” While fears over medical difficulties abound when discussing self-managed abortion, incarceration is the bigger threat in the US. At least 17 people have been arrested in the US for charges connected to self-induced abortion. They include Jennifer Whalen, who served jail time for buying pills online for her 16-year-old daughter to have an abortion, after they couldn’t access an appointment at a clinic. Some, like Purvi Patel in Indiana and Regina McKnight in South Carolina, were given decades-long sentences. Both were overturned, but not before each spent years in jail. But what are the risks of not getting an abortion? First, a lot more people will die during childbirth – which is 14 times more deadly than abortion. “Abortion is a very safe procedure. And in the United States, staying pregnant is relatively deadly, because we have such an abysmal rate of pregnancy-related mortality and morbidity,” explains Dr Amanda Stevenson, who conducted research predicting how many more people will die if Roe v Wade is overturned solely because of the greater mortality risk of continuing a pregnancy. Her study found that, in the event of a nationwide abortion ban, pregnancy-related deaths would increase by 21% within two years. The numbers would be worst for racial minorities. Black people would experience the greatest rate of increase in deaths (33%), followed by Hispanic people (18%). Denying women access to abortion also increases their chances of life-threatening complications, financial hardship and prolonged domestic violence. But if more people know how to manage their own abortions, risks would be reduced, surmises Dr Stevenson. “If the alternative is self-managed abortion, and that’s because clinic-based care isn’t accessible, then that’s a whole lot safer than staying pregnant,” she says. Another midwife, who supports abortions outside a clinical context, points out the dangers associated with in-clinic abortions. She says she has supported people who have gone for an abortion in-clinic, and then found themselves with complications – like hemorrhage, or incomplete removal – who did not want to go back to the doctor. “There’s so many people that are sent home with pills, without any education about what [their experience should look like],” says the midwife, who did not want to be identified for legal reasons. “I have supported people who have had incomplete abortions, and needed to go back to the clinic for a repeat suction a number of times, or have had infections and retained tissues, who did not go back to the clinic because the clinic was abusive … because the clinical care was so impersonal,” she says. As Zipporah puts it, it’s not about placing one treatment over the other, it’s about giving people a choice. “I am not demonizing medical care providers or medical care. I don’t think that abortion should be only always in the clinic with a doctor or only always at home with a midwife. I believe that people need to have the education and support to do whatever the fuck they want. And to realize that they have options,” says Zipporah.",News/US news,The activists championing DIY abortions for a post-Roe v Wade world,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/07/abortion-pill-at-home-activists-future-roe-v-wade
5/7/2022,"It shouldn’t be too hard to find a decent post-election shindig in Scotland this weekend – unless, that is, you’re looking to celebrate with members of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party. In 2016, a Tory tide swept through the Scottish parliament elections, spilled over into the following year’s council vote, and kept the Conservatives bobbing away in second place as recently as last year’s Holyrood contest. But it is now receding, after the party lost 63 councillors to find itself stranded behind Labour in third place. Tory misery is the other parties’ delight, with the SNP, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens all making substantial gains. For the eighth election in a row, the SNP has emerged as decisive winners, gaining 22 seats to reach its highest ever tally of councillors at 453 – the biggest win for anyone since the introduction of the single transferable vote system in 2007. This system allows voters to rank options in order of preference, with votes for eliminated candidates and “surplus” from elected ones transferring to the next best option until the seats for each council ward are filled. If that sounds confusing, Scots have a simple slogan for anyone struggling with their ballot paper: “vote til you boak” (“boak”, rhyming with “poke”, is the Scots word for “vomit”. Just keep ranking your options, in other words, until they’re too rank to rank.) Judging from their collapse, the Scottish Tories have discovered the precise point at which the bile begins to bubble. The party has been quick to try and blame the English for their failure – another old Scots trick – but pleading Partygate only reminds voters that these people cannot distinguish between principles and excuses. Despite a respectable result last year when they held steady at Holyrood, under Douglas Ross’s leadership the Tories have failed to renew the sunny centre-right sensibility cultivated by Ruth Davidson, who fronted their recent revival. Instead, Ross has delved into the paranoia and bitterness of his hardline unionist base, ranting about the Scottish Greens’ “extremist” influence and manifesting the same single-minded obsession over the issue of independence for which he denounces the SNP. His flip-flopping over Johnson’s fitness to be prime minister – calling for resignation before withdrawing the demand – has only reinforced the sense of a man out of his depth. The main beneficiaries of Tory troubles have been their fellow unionists in Scottish Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who gained 20 councillors each. While the Liberal Democrats focused on moderate unionists and local issues, Labour ran a populist campaign around the cost of living, promising to alleviate price rises with a windfall tax on oil and gas. This is not only beyond local authorities’ power, but beyond Holyrood’s as well, and indicates the party’s reliance on the prospect of a Labour government at Westminster to distinguish itself. Labour is regularly attacked as being too close to the Tories and too soft on nationalism at once, which its media-friendly leader, Anas Sarwar, sought to counter by ruling out coalitions with other council groups. Once the results were in, however, a Labour source explained to me that this was merely Sarwar’s “preference”, and that Labour’s Scottish executive committee will approve coalitions on a case-by-case basis. Despite Labour’s gains – coming within one seat of beating the SNP in Glasgow – Scots are unlikely to deliver Keir Starmer a majority any time soon. Sarwar has made small inroads into the softest, most discontented bits of the SNP vote via single transferable vote. But it is not yet enough to swing a first-past-the-post election away from the SNP, so long as independence delivers 40% of voters into the latter’s camp. Labour could irritate the SNP, however, simply by returning to main opposition status, and shedding the doomed aura that has shrouded their manoeuvres since 2015. The Tories are Nicola Sturgeon’s ideal opponents because they give her first dibs on the centre-left as well as the pro-independence vote. Faced with an opposition that confidently shares the SNP’s “social democratic” measurements may force the SNP to work harder at matching rhetoric to action. And by tilting the balance of unionist parties back towards the centre-left, Labour has an opportunity to realign the defence of the union with the wider values of the Scottish public after years of Tory leadership. The biggest success story of all, though, is the Scottish Greens. After winning a record eight seats at Holyrood last year, the Greens signed a cooperation deal with the SNP, turning their co-leaders into government ministers and giving them a range of concrete practical outcomes to campaign on. Despite murmurs about selling out, the party has been rewarded with 16 new councillors, almost doubling their previous result to 35. As well as expanding their Glasgow and Edinburgh groups to 10 apiece, the Greens found new footholds in 8 councils across the country, from Shetland to the Scottish Borders. This, as well as their growing ability to win first-preference votes, suggests that they are becoming both a genuinely national party and something more than a second, “principled” choice for voters. While there was cause for celebration across all major parties but one, it’s worth remembering what they’re being elected to, and who by. Most Scots boaked before they could even bring themselves to vote, with a turnout of just 44%. The creation of a Scottish parliament was helped by the support of Scotland’s local authorities, who sought a bulwark against UK government hostility; but despite its early promise Holyrood has increasingly opted for centralisation over further decentralisation. This has been reinforced by austerity, which the SNP have preferred to hand down to councils rather than implement themselves. The electoral system makes it rare for any party to have overall control of these lumbering, cash-strapped institutions – only Labour in West Dunbartonshire and the SNP in Dundee have majorities – and councillors now have to begin their negotiations in the knowledge that they must share great responsibility without great power. As the cost of living crisis bites and potentially evolves into a recession, it will be the job of these new, expanded council groups to assert the importance of local government against central government – even, in the case of the SNP and Greens, when it’s their own people in charge of the latter. If councillors can’t find ways of proving their independence and relevance to people’s lives, they could find themselves on the wrong side of the boak barrier next time round. And the Tories may be able to benefit from a period on the sidelines.",News/Politics,"In Scotland, the SNP still reign supreme – but the Conservatives have fallen from grace",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/07/in-scotland-the-snp-still-reign-supreme-but-the-conservatives-have-fallen-from-grace
