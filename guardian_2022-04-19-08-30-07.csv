4/19/2022,"Civil servants will be told to return to their desks to ensure government department offices are running at “full capacity”, according to reports. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for government efficiency, has written to all secretaries of state calling on them oversee the “rapid return” of officials to their workplaces. In a letter to ministers, he wrote: “Now that we are learning to live with Covid and have lifted all legal restrictions in England, we must continue to accelerate the return of civil servants to office buildings to realise the benefits of face-to-face, collaborative working and the wider benefits for the economy. “To deliver this, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster [Steve Barclay] and I urge you to issue a clear message to civil servants in your department to ensure a rapid return to the office.” Civil servants have continued to work from home due to unions pushing for concessions on flexible working, the Daily Telegraph said. It is understood Rees-Mogg even sent ministers a “league table” of departments, based on the number of government workers going into the office during the week beginning 4 April. The Department for Education had just a quarter of its staff going in each day on average. The figures were similar at the Department for Work and Pensions (27%) and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (31%). At the other end of the table, 73% of employees travelled into work at the Department for International Trade. A government spokesperson said: “Ministers have been clear that departments should make maximum use of office space and progress is being monitored.” However, it is understood that “full capacity” does not mean every civil servant working from their desk, as some departments do not have space for all of their employees.",News/Business,Jacob Rees-Mogg says civil servants must return to the office,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/jacob-rees-mogg-says-civil-servants-must-return-to-the-office
4/19/2022,"A government-backed “Great British Rail sale” to tempt travellers back to trains will slash the cost of a million journeys next month, but unions have dismissed it as a gimmick. The Department for Transport said the offer was “further supporting families with the cost of living” at a time of high inflation. While campaigners and the industry welcomed the move as a first step, Labour said it would offer little relief. Only about 1% of all journeys taken are likely to benefit from the promotion, which is targeted at intercity travel at quiet times, meaning even fewer commuters will see any reduction in fares. Nonetheless, the offer, billed as a “first-of-its-kind Great British Rail sale”, has been enthusiastically endorsed by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, in a bizarre promotional video. Shapps, a former salesman who once ran a web marketing business under the pseudonym Michael Green, employs his skills to full effect at various points in the video donning a hoodie, sunglasses, rucksack and handling a rubber crab to advertise travel to locations from Cornwall to Edinburgh. He ends by declaring: “It’s time to get real,” before boarding an LNER train. The fares, which include a single journey from London to Edinburgh for £22, Manchester to Newcastle for £10.30, and Birmingham to Bristol Temple Meads for £12.60, will be launched on Tuesday on a Great British Rail sale site. The cut-price tickets will only be available for a five-week period before the next half-term holiday, from 25 April to 27 May, and are not expected to be available over the first May bank holiday weekend. The Campaign for Better Transport said the sale was a useful first step in getting people back on to trains as the pandemic eases. Former transport minister Norman Baker said: “It can show the Treasury that the way to increase income is to cut fares, not keep ratcheting them up and driving people off the railway.” However, unions and Labour dismissed the scheme. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “This headline grabbing gimmick won’t help commuters at all … Working people need affordable rail travel every day.” The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: “The railway system and the travelling public do not need short-term gimmicks. We need a properly funded railway that provides permanently good value and reliability.” The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said: “This temporary respite will be small comfort to passengers who had thousands taken out of their pockets from soaring fares since 2010.” Advice to avoid travel during the pandemic and the subsequent shift to working from home has seen a swathe of regular passengers desert the railway. Passenger levels have only returned to about 75% of pre-Covid levels, according to the latest provisional DfT figures. While much of the industry has argued price cuts were needed to attract people back to rail, fares have continued to rise. Regulated rail fares, set by the government, rose last month by 3.8%, in line with RPI inflation, after increasing by 1% above RPI inflation in 2021. The DfT said reforms to the sector due to be introduced after the Williams-Shapps review could see more such network-wide sales across rail. It has also introduced season tickets for part-time or flexible workers to address changing travel patterns since the pandemic, although many commuters questioned their worth. Train operators and Network Rail have been told by the DfT to find cost savings of 10% to 15%, after the Treasury spent an extra £15bn subsidising rail for lost revenue over the past two years.",News/Business,Government plan to tempt UK back to trains dismissed as gimmick,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/government-plan-to-tempt-uk-back-to-trains-dismissed-as-gimmick
4/19/2022,"The high street chemist Boots is joining the ranks of retailers vowing to stop selling all wet wipes that contain plastic fibres, as part of efforts to cut non-biodegradable waste. The retailer said it was committing to stop selling all wet wipes containing plastic by the end of the year and would replace them with plant-based alternatives. Wipes are often flushed down the toilet by consumers, causing environmental damage by blocking sewers and waterways. Boots said it is one of the biggest sellers of wet wipes in the UK, having sold more than 800m over the last year online and in its 2,200 stores, from 140 product lines across its skincare, baby, tissue and health care ranges. It said its sales represented about 15% of all beauty face wipes sold in the UK. The move follows Boots’ earlier decision to reformulate its own-brand ranges of wipes. It has written to its suppliers in the UK and Ireland to ask them to follow suit. The company, which is owned by the US health group Walgreens Boots Alliance, is joining other retailers including Tesco and the health food chain Holland & Barrett in banning the sale of plastic-based wipes. The Body Shop beauty chain has also phased out all face wipes from its shops. Steve Ager, the chief customer and commercial officer at Boots UK, said its customers were becoming more aware of their impact on the environment: “They are actively looking to brands and retailers to help them lead more sustainable lives. “We removed plastics from our own-brand and No7 wet wipe ranges in 2021, and now we are calling on other brands and retailers across the UK to follow suit in eliminating all plastic-based wet wipes.” It is estimated that as many as 11bn wet wipes are used in the UK each year, with the majority containing some form of plastic, many of which are flushed away after use. In recent months, MPs have heard evidence about wet wipes forming islands within rivers, causing the waterways to change shape as the products pile up. They are also a significant component of the fatbergs that form in sewers, leading to blockages that require complex interventions to remove. Microplastic pollution – often found in plastic packaging, pipes and some bottles – poses a serious threat to marine animals, and has recently been discovered lodged deep in the lungs of living people. Boots said its own-brand wipes would be labelled as “do not flush”, while those developed for intimate use would be formulated to meet flushability standards. The retailer said it had also expanded its ranges of reusable and refillable products over the last two years, and was working to remove plastic from product packaging and from its online deliveries.",News/Business,Boots to stop selling plastic-based wet wipes in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/boots-to-stop-selling-plastic-based-wet-wipes-in-uk
4/19/2022,"NHS leaders are urging people to attend vital lung cancer check-ups as figures reveal almost two-thirds of those invited are not coming forward. The NHS targeted lung health check service offered in some parts of England aims to help diagnose cancer at an earlier stage when treatment may be more successful. Current and former smokers aged between 55 and 74 are invited to speak to a healthcare professional and, if they have a higher chance of developing lung cancer, are offered a scan of their lungs. Doctors are keen to reach those who may not have sought help for symptoms during the pandemic and could be living with undiagnosed lung cancer. People diagnosed at the earliest stage are nearly 20 times more likely to survive for five years than those whose cancer is caught late, according to the NHS. The NHS has already diagnosed 600 people with the disease in travelling trucks, which visit convenient community sites across the UK, such as supermarkets and sports centres, aiming to make it easier for people to access check-ups. But figures show only a third (35%) of patients go to their lung health check when invited by the NHS. “These lung checks can save lives,” said Dame Cally Palmer, the NHS cancer director. “By going out into communities we find more people who may not have otherwise realised they have lung cancer, with hundreds already diagnosed and hundreds of thousands due to be invited. “The trucks are conveniently located to make them easy to access and it is vital that as soon as you are invited, you take up the offer and come forward for these potentially life-saving checks.” The mobile trucks are targeting areas with some of the highest lung cancer death rates. NHS teams have also identified thousands of people with other undiagnosed conditions via the trucks, including respiratory and cardiovascular disease, enabling them to access the treatment they need earlier. Prof Peter Johnson, the NHS clinical director for cancer, said: “Lives are saved when cancers are caught early and when more people are referred for tests, which is why the NHS has put so much effort into early diagnosis in recent years. “We know that some people had concerns seeking help during the pandemic but if you do have a worrying symptom or have been coughing for three weeks or more, please do contact your GP and get checked out.”",News/Society,NHS urges people to attend vital lung cancer check-ups in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/19/nhs-lung-cancer-check-ups-mobile-trucks-england
4/19/2022,"Sir Bradley Wiggins has alleged that he was sexually groomed by a coach when he was 13 years old. Wiggins, the first Briton to win the Tour de France and a three-time Olympic champion, said that he had “buried” what had happened because he had no one to turn to at the time. “I was groomed by a coach when I was younger – I was about 13 – and I never fully accepted that,” Wiggins said in an interview with Men’s Health UK magazine about his allegations. Asked if he was groomed sexually, the 41-year-old added: “Yes. It all impacted me as an adult ... I buried it.” Wiggins said he had been unable to confide in his father as he used to beat him and criticise him for wearing cycling gear. “My stepfather was quite violent to me, he used to call me a faggot for wearing Lycra and stuff, so I didn’t think I could tell him,” he said. “I was such a loner. I just wanted to get out of the environment. I became so insular. I was quite a strange teenager in many ways and I think the drive on the bike stemmed from adversity.” Wiggins has spoken about suffering from depression and a difficult childhood, but made the fresh revelation in the interview with Alastair Campbell for the May issue of Men’s Health, which goes on sale on Wednesday. He also admitted that he had spent much of his life trying to understand his relationship with his father, Australian cyclist Gary Wiggins, who walked out on the family when Bradley was young and who died in 2008 following a fight at a house party. “It was definitely to do with my dad,” Wiggins said when asked what he had tried to run from in his life. “Never getting answers when he was murdered in 2008. He left us when I was little, so I met him for the first time when I was 18. We rekindled some kind of relationship but then we didn’t speak for the last couple of years before he was murdered. “He was my hero. I wanted to prove myself to him. He was a good cyclist – he could have been really good – but he was a wasted talent. He was an alcoholic, a manic depressive, quite violent and he took a lot of amphetamines and drugs back then.” Wiggins also admitted that he had found it difficult to cope with the pressures of fame that came from winning the Tour and the Olympic time trial in 2012. “After winning the Tour de France, then winning at the Olympics, life was never the same again,” he said. “I was thrust into this fame and adulation that came with the success ... I’m an introverted, private person. I didn’t know who ‘me’ was, so I adopted a kind of veil – a sort of rock-star veil. It wasn’t really me ... It was probably the unhappiest period of my life. “Everything I did was about winning for other people, and the pressures that came with being the first British winner of the Tour. I really struggled with it.”",Sport/Sport,Bradley Wiggins alleges he was sexually groomed by a coach as a teenager,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/bradley-wiggins-reveals-he-was-sexually-groomed-by-a-coach-as-a-teenager
