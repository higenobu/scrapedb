2/11/2022,"Crystal Cruises has shut its US offices and let its workers go, Bloomberg reported. The news comes days after two of its ships were seized in the Bahamas over unpaid fuel bills. Parent company Genting Hong Kong has filed to wind up. Crystal Cruises is closing down its offices in the US and has let its employees go, Bloomberg reported, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. Workers were terminated on Wednesday, Bloomberg added, citing the person who requested anonymity as the information hasn't been announced to the public. The report did not specify how many employees were let go. The closure comes just days after two of its ships — Crystal Symphony and Crystal Serenity — were seized by authorities in the Bahamas over unpaid fuel bills, Cruise Law News reported. Crystal Cruises is headquartered in Miami. The Crystal Symphony diverted to the Bahamas last month from its scheduled stop in Miami with 700 passengers on board after an arrest warrant was issued over a $1.2 million unpaid fuel bill. Earlier this month, the Crystal Serenity diverted to the Bahamas after it was denied entry to Aruba. Crew members on board ships received the news of Crystal Cruises' closure via their captains, Cruise Hive reported. ""Unfortunately, this is the end of Crystal Cruises,"" one captain told his crew, according to a recording of his message posted to Twitter by Crew Center, a website run by former crew members. A crew member onboard Crystal Endeavour told Cruise Hive the announcement was from the captain. ""We don't know what's going to happen in the future,"" the captain added. Vessel management company V.Ships will become the new managing firm, he said. The closure of Crystal Cruises' US office comes after its parent company, Genting Hong Kong, filed to wind up, according to a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing dated January 19. It reported a record loss of $1.7 billion in 2020 as the pandemic devastated tourism. Though its on-year losses narrowed by two-thirds to $238 million in the first half of 2021, the company's woes continued. Crystal Cruises announced on January 19 that it would suspend all cruises through May. Just one ship — Crystal Endeavor — in its fleet of eight is still at sea, according to cruise tracking website cruisemapper.com. Crystal Cruises, Genting Cruise Lines in Hong Kong and V.Ships did not immediately reply to Insider's requests for comment. Crystal Cruises has a far smaller fleet of eight ships than rivals like Carnival and Royal Caribbean, which have a fleet of 26 each, according to their websites. Norwegian Cruise Line has 19 ships. Crystal Cruises ships, such as Crystal Serenity, which can carry 900 passengers, are known for fancy features like penthouse suites with butler services. Serenity has also hosted celebrity chef Nobu Matsuhisa.

2/11/2022,"An admiral for the U.S. Navy claimed ""high-profile"" requests, including one from first lady Jill Biden, caused disruption to overall Afghanistan evacuation efforts last year. Rear Adm. Peter Vasely, who serves as a special assistant to the Director of the Navy Staff, said incessant calls for help during the efforts to get Americans out of the now-Taliban-controlled country caused a ""distraction"" and ""created competition for already stressed resources."" Vasley's remarks, stemming from a late September interview, came in a story by the Washington Post, which obtained a 2,000-page report from the probe of the 17-day operation out of Kabul. ""That’s accurate,"" ​Vasley said when asked in sworn testimony for the report whether Pope Francis and First Lady Jill Biden intervened in evacuation efforts to request help on behalf of others. BIDEN ADMIN'S AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL FAILURES DETAILED IN REPORT ""I was being contacted by representatives from the Holy See to assist the Italian military contingent … in getting through groups … of special interest to the Vatican,"" he said. ""That is just one of many examples.​""​ ""I cannot stress enough​ ​how these high-profile requests ate up bandwidth and created competition for already stressed resources​,"" Vasley added. Vasley, overwhelmed with phone calls, text messages and emails at the time at the U.S. operations center at Kabul’s international airport, told investigators he established a ""coordination cell"" to help handle the high volume of communication from Washington and elsewhere. ""But you had everyone from the White House down with a new flavor of the day for prioritization,"" Vasely told investigators for the report. That declassified report, which featured dozens of interviews with military officials, was rejected by President Biden during an interview with NBC News released Thursday night. Asked by anchor Lester Holt about the report and whether the accusations in the report ""ring true"" to him, Biden said, ""No. That's not what I was told."" ""I just want to clarify, are you rejecting the conclusions, or the accounts that are in this Army report,"" Holt asked. ""Yes, I am,"" Biden responded. ""They are not true,"" Holt pressed. ""I am rejecting them,"" Biden said. Biden has faced immense criticism for his rocky withdrawal from Afghanistan, which resulted in 13 American service members losing their lives during the evacuation effort after a bomb exploded near an airport checkpoint they were manning in Kabul. The Pentagon concluded last week that the August 2021 suicide bombing in Kabul during evacuation efforts near the U.S. embassy was ""not preventable.""",World/Fox News,"Jill Biden helped gum up the Afghanistan evacuation effort, Navy admiral claims in report",https://news.yahoo.com/jill-biden-helped-gum-afghanistan-025115305.html
