3/21/2022,"STORY: The retired librarian lives in Kharkiv, a Ukrainian city of 1.5 million people that lies near the Russian border. It has been barraged by Russian air and rocket strikes that have reduced many buildings to rubble. ""I could never imagine that a new war would start in my old age. In my worst nightmare, I could not even imagine that such a massacre would be repeated, it is horrible,"" she told Reuters. Morozova was just seven years old in 1941 when German forces began the siege of the Soviet city of Leningrad in Russia, now known as St. Petersburg, where around 1.5 million died during two years of blockade. She said she still has vivid memories of the Nazi bombardments after she and her mother missed a ferry out of the port, only to watch with horror as the boat was then destroyed by shells. After the war, she moved to Kharkiv in Ukraine, where she has lived for the last 60 years and where she now finds unmistakable echoes of her past. ""In my childhood I hid from bombardments in the corridor. We took shelter in old buildings. And it is the same now,"" said Morozova, a native Russian speaker who has a daughter living in Kharkiv and a son in St. Petersburg. Earlier this week the mayor of Kharkiv said the city had been under constant attack by Russian forces. Russia refers to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" and says its forces do not target civilians. Caught up in a conflict between the land of her birth and the land where she lives now, Morozova believes it will be a disaster for both sides.",Politics/Reuters Videos,The Leningrad siege survivor stuck in another war,https://news.yahoo.com/leningrad-siege-survivor-stuck-another-153417299.html
3/21/2022,"The D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War concluded that ""Ukrainian forces have defeated the initial Russian campaign of this war,"" in an assessment published Saturday, The New York Times reported. The assessment argues that Russia had failed in its initial goal of swiftly capturing Kyiv and other major cities and toppling the Ukrainian government and that Russian forces ""are very unlikely"" to capture these major objectives if they persist in their present strategy. ""The doctrinally sound Russian response,"" the assessment concluded, would be for Russian forces to pause and regroup instead of ""continuing to feed small collections of reinforcements into an ongoing effort to keep the current campaign alive."" U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made similar comments in Bulgaria on Saturday. ""I think [Russia] envisioned that they would move rapidly and very quickly seize the capital city. They've not been able to do that,"" he said, according to CNN. In an address to the nation delivered Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said over 14,000 Russian troops have been killed since the invasion began on Feb. 24. The U.S. estimates Russian military deaths at around 7,000. ""In places of especially fierce battles, the frontline of our defense is simply piled with the corpses of Russian soldiers,"" Zelensky said. Kori Schake, the director of foreign and defense policy at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, wrote in The Washington Post on Thursday that the ""deficiencies of the Russian military are exacerbating the damage and risks of the war."" Schake argued that ""Russia's first resort to overcome inadequacies has been to shift its focus from attacking military forces to targeting civilian populations indiscriminately."" As of Saturday, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights was able to confirm that 847 Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the fighting, though the report also says the ""OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher.""

3/21/2022,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that neither he nor his people can accept some of Russia's reported demands for ending its increasingly brutal invasion, which is now entering its fourth week. Notably, Zelensky said, Ukraine would not be giving any territorial concessions to Russia. ""There are compromises for which we cannot be ready as an independent state,"" he told CNN host Fareed Zakaria, speaking through an interpreter. ""Any compromises related to our territorial integrity and our sovereignty .... [the] Ukrainian people have spoken about it. They have not greeted Russian soldiers with a bunch of flowers; they have greeted them with bravery, and they have greeted them with weapons in their hands."" Zelensky added: “You cannot curry favor with the citizens of another country forcibly.” According to Turkey's government, which has strong relations with both Ukraine and Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin recently outlined a series of terms for ending his attack. The most challenging of those terms relate to Ukrainian territory. BBC News, which reported on Turkey’s phone call with Putin, wrote, ""The assumption is that Russia will demand that the Ukrainian government should give up territory in eastern Ukraine."" Russia has for years backed an armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine, and before the invasion it formally recognized two breakaway republics there along the Russian border. In 2014, Russia also invaded and annexed the Crimean peninsula, which was previously controlled by Ukraine. Much of the world — including Ukraine, the U.S. and most of Europe — refused to recognize the territory as part of Russia. The Kremlin is likely seeking this recognition as part of the peace terms as well. On Sunday, Zelensky said as both a president and citizen of Ukraine, these types of terms are a nonstarter. ""You cannot just demand from Ukraine to recognize some territories as independent republics. These compromises are simply wrong,"" he said. Russia's other demands may be easier for Ukraine to entertain, such as Kyiv vowing to never join the NATO military alliance. Both Zelensky and prior Ukrainian administrations have long requested membership in NATO, which carries with it a mutual-defense pact in case of an attack. NATO has quietly rebuffed Ukraine’s request, fearing antagonizing Russia and triggering a global war. “If we were a NATO member, a war wouldn't have started. I'd like to receive security guarantees for my country, for my people,” Zelensky said, calling for the Western military alliance to finally give Ukraine clarity on its membership ask. “If NATO members are ready to see us in the alliance, then do it immediately because people are dying on a daily basis.” Zelensky also repeated his call for Putin to meet with him directly to hammer out a peace accord. The Kremlin has not appeared eager for such a meeting to take place, arguing that the terms of the ceasefire need to be ironed out in advance. ""I think that without negotiations, we cannot end this war. I think that all of the people who think that this dialogue is shallow and that it is not going to resolve anything, they just don't understand that this is very valuable. If there is just a 1% chance for us to stop this war, I think that we need to take this chance. We need to do that.""",World/Yahoo News,Zelensky draws line in negotiations: We're not giving land to Russia,https://news.yahoo.com/volodymyr-zelensky-fareed-zakaria-cnn-ukraine-165552475.html
3/21/2022,"The U.S. Senate, a body known in recent years for decisive inaction and kneejerk partisan division, somehow managed a unanimous vote this week on a measure making daylight saving time year-round. The Sunshine Protection Act, if enacted into law, would mean that the semiannual chore of changing clock hour hands would be called off in 2023. Legislation doing away with the clock-changes has been a regular feature in the Florida Legislature going back some 14 years. Always popular at session time when the days are growing longer. And it's been something of a seasonal hobbyhorse for U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio who sponsored the bill. Wait, we've been here before: Didn't Florida agree to do away with the whole clock-changing thing? Daylight saving time: A century of clock changing could soon run out. And why not? April's clock change can be painful. It was especially hard on me back when my kids were teenagers and Seabreeze High School's late bell rang at 7:20 a.m., a time that we used to call ""6:20"" only the week before the time change. I organize my life around being a slow riser. This is not a moral failing; I was born that way. I don't attend breakfast meetings or post sunrises on Instagram. I'll pay quite a bit extra for later flights out of town. I eat at places that stick with their breakfast menu well after noontime while withholding judgment on customers. I am not to be trusted operating heavy machinery or motor vehicles on busy streets in single-digit morning hours, so working from home has lately suited me fine. So I, of all people, should be applauding this action, right? No harsh transitioning with the time shift. More after-dinner walks on the beach. And yet, sad to say, sometimes excellent springtime ideas don't always feel the same come wintertime. The last time Congress voted to put the nation on year-round daylight saving time came in 1973, the start of the '70s energy crisis. Ancient history from the days of the Old Ones. The idea was that this would save energy. If the regular daylight saving time season saved energy, it seemed to follow that permanent daylight saving time would save even more. But the result was long, dark morning hours come wintertime. ""Daylight saving time all year would be intolerable"" was the headline in a Daytona Beach Evening News editorial as the measure breezed through Congress. But after eight Florida schoolchildren died in predawn car crashes, Gov. Reubin Askew called a short-notice special session in January 1974 to take peninsular Florida off daylight saving time altogether. (The Panhandle is in the Central time zone, which complicated things.) The Legislature refused with a quick vote, and members turned around and went home, no doubt grumbling all the way. Still, there was a lot of public unhappiness, which was what Askew was reacting to. Year-round daylight saving time was popular when it took effect, but the public turned on it within a year. Dark mornings at the bus stop soured a lot of parents on year-round daylight saving time. Predawn commutes were no fun either. Gas savings? Negligible, according to a Department of Transportation study at the time. Longer daylight in the afternoons encouraged more people to be on the road in the early evening. Energy savings? When President Woodrow Wilson called for imposing daylight saving time during World War I, it saved energy on lighting. But air conditioning wasn't in use yet and late afternoons in Florida before the sun goes down now is prime time for compressors to be hardest at work compressing. Bottom line: Marginal at best energy savings. But still, more springtime outdoor time. For Floridians, beach time after work! Yes, depressing winter mornings but safer driving on the way home from work. So even if the measure is a heartening demonstration that the U.S. Senate is on occasion capable of doing something, anything, the broader effects seem to be kind of a wash.

3/21/2022,"March 21 (Reuters) - Several hundred mines have drifted into the Black Sea after breaking off from cables near Ukrainian ports, Russia's main intelligence agency and shipping market participants said. The Black Sea is a major shipping artery for grain, oil and oil products. ""Due to storm weather, the cables connecting the mines to anchors were broken,"" Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said in a press release dated March 19. ""Due to wind and water currents, the mines are drifting freely in the western part of the Black Sea,"" the FSB said. The FSB said about 420 mines had broken lose. Novorossiisk Port Authority, in a note seen by Reuters, said that shipping was at risk in the western Black Sea. Shipping sources said Turkish authorities had cautioned about the risk for those using the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits.
