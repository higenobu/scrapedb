3/23/2022,"Transparency campaigners have accused ministers of conducting “government by WhatsApp” in the UK’s third-highest court, arguing that the use of self-destructing messages on insecure platforms is unlawful and undemocratic. Ministers and government officials could be stopped from sending “disappearing messages” after failing to keep public records of exchanges on personal phones, email and WhatsApp. Some of those communications addressed matters of considerable public importance relating to the pandemic response and the awarding of government contracts. From Tuesday, two separate cases will be heard over three days, with a decision at a later date. The first case is brought by transparency campaigners All the Citizens (ATC) and non-profit Foxglove over the use of disappearing messages and auto-delete functions. The second case, brought by the Good Law Project, focuses on private devices. On Tuesday, the high court heard that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has used personal WhatsApp accounts to communicate “critical decisions”. Ben Jaffey QC, representing ATC, said the messages could serve as a “public record for future societies” and that deletion does not adhere to “meaningful and parliamentary democracy”, allowing for “scrutiny through inquiries or court proceedings”.The campaigners are also seeking an end to a Cabinet Office policy of deleting messages sent on personal devices, in some cases using functions that auto-delete messages after seven days, which they argue breaches the Public Records Act. The government’s legal team contend that it is not unlawful for ministers to choose how they communicate, and the use of private devices is common in modern workplaces. Executive director of ATC, Clara Maguire, said the case was prompted by a refusal from the Cabinet Office to answer questions on the use of WhatsApp for government business, which contravenes government policy. She said: “It’s extraordinary that we’ve had to come to court to try and get answers. Our evidence reveals disappearing messages have been used time and again. This period, Boris Johnson’s government, will be a black hole for future historians.” Evidence submitted to the judge includes several witness statements in which key figures of government are named for their use of personal devices and auto-deletion. These include Johnson’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings, half the permanent secretaries in the Cabinet Office, all the special advisers and most Cabinet Office ministers, including the former health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi.The evidence also shows that the prime minister requested summaries of his “red box” submissions by WhatsApp to his personal phone, even though No 10 policy prohibits the use of the platform for “non-trivial communications”. In their written arguments, the claimants’ lawyers contended that the “admitted instances of the use of automatic deletion are likely to be the tip of a much larger iceberg”. The government’s legal team has suggested that information in private accounts is “not, in principle, inaccessible” and can be retrieved on request, that although their use is discouraged it is not banned, and contend that “it is possible to operate automatic deletion lawfully and fairly”. In a written submission, they argued that “there is no principle” of common law stopping ministers or officials from communicating in a way “they consider appropriate”.They continued: “The claims advanced are detached from the reality of current working practices. The modern working age is defined by instant and fast-paced communications.” The cases continue.",News/Law,UK ministers accused of ‘government by WhatsApp’ in court,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/22/uk-ministers-accused-of-government-by-whatsapp-in-court
3/23/2022,"Forest fires have erupted in the vicinity of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, with Ukraine claiming that Russian control of the abandoned power plant is hampering efforts to control the flames. At least seven fires have been spotted within Chernobyl’s exclusion zone via satellite imagery taken by the European Space Agency, according to a statement by Ukraine’s parliament. The fires were probably ignited by the “armed aggression of the Russian federation”, the parliament said, although it’s not clear whether it was shelling, arson or some other factor that caused the outbreak. Fires like these within 10km of the plant are “particularly dangerous”, the statement added, with Ukraine claiming its firefighters are unable to tackle the blazes due to Russia’s presence. Russian forces captured the Chernobyl plant in the opening days of the invasion of Ukraine in February. The site is known for a 1986 explosion and resulting fire that caused a major nuclear disaster, spreading radioactive contamination across Europe. The plant and surrounding area have largely been sealed off since then. However, about 200 tons of fuel remain at the bottom of the crippled reactor and is relatively unprotected. Experts have raised concern that fierce fighting in the area could damage the reactor further and cause radioactive material to escape. Ukrainian authorities say the ongoing war is also hindering attempts to monitor radiation levels at Chernobyl. “There is no data on the current state of radiation pollution of the exclusion zone’s environment, which makes it impossible to adequately respond to threats,” said Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company. “Radiation levels in the exclusion zone and beyond, including not only Ukraine, but also other countries, could significantly worsen.” In 2020, a forest fire near the reactor caused radiation levels to spike to 16 times above normal. The conflagration was extinguished after a two-week effort by firefighters, with a man arrested for allegedly starting the fire “for fun”. Climate scientists have pointed out that such potential disasters are partially a symptom of global heating, with rising temperatures causing forests to dry out and become more suitable fuel for fire. In Europe, places from Sweden to the Mediterranean have experienced record fire outbreaks in recent years. In the Chernobyl region itself, the die-off of surrounding trees due to the nuclear disaster has left a large amount of dead, fire-prone wood that is susceptible to large blazes. In 2015, an international team of scientists warned that “an expanding flammable area associated with climate change will lead to a high risk of radioactive contamination with characteristic fire peaks in the future.” The study added that firefighting infrastructure in the area was understaffed and underfunded, even before the Russian invasion. Separate research published last year confirmed that smoke from forest fires can carry radioactive material, and that the escalating climate crisis risks “nuclear wildfires [that] present a pressing yet little discussed problem”. Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University, said the fires in Ukraine fitted with that pattern of climate change-fueled wildfire that has repeatedly scorched places such as the US and Australia. Mann said the war and the climate crisis share a broader cause, namely “our continued dependence on fossil fuels”. “Fossil fuels are what prop up authoritarian petrostates like Russia who have used the tremendous wealth they have derived from the mining and selling of fossil fuels to the rest of the world to build their military,” he said.",News/World news,Forest fires erupt around Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/chernobyl-forest-fires-ukraine-nuclear-plant
3/23/2022,"Billions of pounds linked to the Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov and his business empire appear to have been held in secret Swiss accounts belonging to his family, an analysis of leaked documents suggests. Usmanov’s 56-year-old sister, Saodat Narzieva, appears to have been the one-time beneficial owner of at least 27 secret corporate accounts at Credit Suisse, including one that held nearly 1.9bn Swiss francs (CHF) (£1.6bn). Usmanov is subject to EU sanctions. Narzieva is a gynaecologist and obstetrician in a maternity hospital in Uzbekistan’s capital, Tashkent. Her name is attached to Credit Suisse accounts that appear in the Suisse secrets project, a leak of data relating to 30,000 clients of the Swiss bank. It is not clear why her name would be linked to accounts associated with her brother’s business empire. A spokesperson for Usmanov suggested the Credit Suisse data was “fake and incorrect” and there was nothing untoward about his financial relations with his sister, which were lawful and indicative of his “generosity”. Information from numerous financial leaks, including Suisse secrets, the Panama papers and FinCEN Files, has allowed reporters at the Guardian to highlight the vast wealth linked to Usmanov. The disclosures highlight the potential challenges western governments face when sanctioning or freezing the assets of oligarchs. The Russian Asset Tracker project has included relatives and associates, because in some cases their wealth derives almost entirely from the person under sanctions. Including family gives a more complete picture of the scale of their fortunes and, in some cases, they may have been used to hide or disperse assets. Last month, the US Treasury highlighted the problems of ownership by stating: “Sanctioned oligarchs and powerful Russian elites have used family members to move assets and to conceal their immense wealth.” Usmanov was worth an estimated $18.4bn (£14bn) in 2021 when he was listed as one of the world’s 100 wealthiest people by Forbes magazine. When the Guardian first asked Usmanov about links between the Credit Suisse accounts showing his sister as a beneficiary and his business group on 15 February, before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he instructed the London law firm Schillings to respond on his behalf. At the time, they said “true or false, information about a person’s finances is private. We can see no reason at all for our client to discuss financial dealings with journalists.” Schillings did not respond when asked whether the firm still represented the oligarch. The spokesperson for Usmanov has since stated that Narzieva did not have “possession or control of any accounts in Swiss banks on behalf of her brother”. “Any financial relations of Mr Usmanov with his sister would have been [the] result of his well-known generosity and support that he has always lawfully lent to his relatives,” they said. His spokesperson added that “all of Mr Usmanov’s businesses have been audited by Big 4 [audit] companies, since their inception, as well as were his personal tax returns and expenses. All of his investments, his expenses and his income have gone through strict compliance procedures.” Usmanov, an Uzbek-born businessman, has been subject to an asset freeze and EU travel ban since late February, after the bloc identified him as “one of Vladimir Putin’s favourite oligarchs” who it is claimed has paid millions to one of Putin’s influential advisers and been “entrusted with servicing financial flows”. Usmanov accused the EU of “false and defamatory allegations” that were “damaging his honour, dignity and business reputation”. Sanctions have also been imposed on him in the US and UK, where he once held a 30% stake in Arsenal football club. Switzerland has followed suit, ditching political neutrality to match the EU’s efforts. While western governments have introduced sanctions against the relatives of some Russian oligarchs, none of Usmanov’s family members have been included on any lists so far. According to documents in the Suisse secrets data, the 27 accounts at Credit Suisse that listed Narzieva as the beneficial owner were opened between 2004 and 2014, and 16 listed Usmanov’s metals, mining and telecoms holding company, USM, as a contact. The largest of the accounts held nearly 1.9bn CHF in 2011, while two others held up to 1.3bn CHF and 460m CHF in 2014. While a handful of the accounts were closed by 2016, about 18 are believed to have still been active in recent years. All of the assets were held in business accounts, some of which are believed to be linked to offshore companies. Credit Suisse said it was unable to comment on the accounts because of Swiss banking secrecy laws, and said it applies all sanctions “as a matter of principle and policy.” ""The information presented by the OCCRP Media Consortium is not new. As a matter of law Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships but would note that names being focused on were already referenced in previous requests by the OCCRP. As a matter of principle and policy the bank applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland. As stated last month, approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts based on these requests are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries. We continue to strongly reject the allegations and insinuations about the bank’s purported business practices. Such allegations are without factual basis and represent a continued concerted effort to discredit the bank and the Swiss financial marketplace, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years. As we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.” Narzieva’s brother made his fortune producing plastic bags, which were a rare commodity in the former Soviet Union, and later went on to manage the investment holdings arm of Russia’s state-owned gas company Gazprom from 2000 to 2014. He built stakes in a range of metals, mining, telecom and media firms through USM, which owns Russia’s second-largest mobile phone operator, MegaFon, as well as a 49% stake Metalloinvest, the metals and mining company Usmanov founded in 1999. A leaked email from the Panama papers lists Narzieva as one of several close relatives for whom offshore companies were being set up in 2013, in order to hold shares in another of Usmanov’s holding companies, ABU. The email, sent by the now-defunct Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, suggested that each of the so-called special purpose vehicles would hold bank accounts with Credit Suisse and another Swiss bank, Julius Baer. According to documents reviewed by the Guardian, one American bank raised suspicions about $1.6m-worth of transfers made between accounts linked to Usmanov and his associates between 2003 and 2015, including through one of the Credit Suisse accounts that named Narzieva as a beneficial owner. The bank reported that there were suspicions on the grounds that the company at the centre of the report – Usmanov’s Cyprus-based Gallagher Holdings – appeared to be a shell company that conducted “a significant amount of wires with numerous other shell entities”. The suspicious activity report (SAR) – filed in 2016 and later obtained by BuzzFeed and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists – said the bank could not determine the purpose of some of the transactions. The SAR added that it was concerned that “Gallagher appears to be owned by individuals with connections to Putin.” Banks and other financial institutions file SARs with law enforcement bodies when they suspect a client may be using their services for potential criminal activity. However, SARs do not mean a client is guilty of wrongdoing or require a bank to cease doing business with the client. A separate SAR filed in 2017 suggested Usmanov was the original source of more than $2.5m that Narzieva used to send money to a steel company boss in the Middle East in 2013. According to the SAR, Narzieva appears to have forwarded the money to the Middle Eastern businessman shortly after Usmanov wired his sister a “gift” of $3m. She later sent at least $50,000 back to Usmanov – which was related to “current expenses”, according to the payment reference. That businessman was the boss of a joint venture established by Usmanov’s Metalloinvest in 2010. The bank said in the SAR that it could not establish the purpose of the wire transfer between Narzieva and the Middle Eastern businessman since they “appear to be engaged in different lines of business as a doctor and managing director of a steel company, respectively”. The spokesperson for Usmanov and Narzieva did not explain the purpose of the transfer but said the Middle Eastern businessman was her son-in-law. Usmanov’s spokesperson said: “The entirety of Mr Usmanov’s capital was built through successful, sometimes risky, investments, as well as through the effective management of his assets, which is the essence of business.”The representative also stressed that, unlike some other wealthy Russian businessmen, Usmanov did not gain his fortune by acquiring newly-privatised Russian assets following the end of the Soviet Union They added: “Mr Usmanov has never acquired anything nor has he benefited from the Russian government, or that of any other state.”",News/World news,Oligarch linked to billions in 27 Swiss bank accounts in sister’s name ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/oligarch-alisher-usmanov-swiss-bank-arsenal
3/23/2022,"Sometimes the most exciting collaborations happen when the participants are so distinct that they have no clear connection. For example, no two shoe designers have less overlap than Birkenstock and Manolo Blahnik, the brand that was immortalised by Sex and the City. Should they collaborate on a new shoe that struggles hard to merge their disparate styles? Probably not. But have they? Yes. Birkenstock has hired Blahnik to jazz up its women’s range. The results of this crazed experiment include fuchsia and royal blue velvet interpretations of the classic Arizona model, and a new version of the black leather Boston shoe. The likelihood is that you won’t buy a pair of these shoes. If you want to wear Manolo Blahniks you won’t want to clod around in a pair of Birkenstocks; and if you like Birkenstocks, you aren’t going to want to spend £415 on an impractical-looking new pair with a sparkly buckle. But that doesn’t mean the whole thing isn’t interesting. On the surface, the new range looks like Blahnik’s concession to lockdown. Just as working from home has caused a lot of formalwear companies to pivot to sweaters and chinos, Covid must have also made a dent in the luxury footwear industry. You buy a pair of Manolos so that you can be seen in them, so it’s difficult to justify splashing out when the only souls who have seen you for two years are your cat and the occasional Yodel driver. As such, you could be forgiven for thinking that partnering with Birkenstock is the first step of a progression that logically ends with Manolo Blahnik collaborating with Pop Tarts on a glittery new breakfast cereal for people too depressed to cook dinner. But it’s a little more complicated than that. This is because, despite its utilitarian origins, Birkenstock is now also a luxury brand. Last year, the company was acquired by an investment fund part-owned by the luxury French conglomerate LVMH, which is responsible for Louis Vuitton, Dom Pérignon, Bulgari and countless others. So perhaps this is LVMH’s attempt to pull Birkenstock in line with the rest of its luxury lineup. Perhaps next we’ll see glass Birkenstocks, or Birkenstocks with eight-inch heels. It would make sense: after all, they wouldn’t be any harder to break in.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Birkenstock and Manolo Blahnik: is this the most unlikely fashion pairing ever?,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/22/birkenstock-and-manolo-blahnik-is-this-the-most-unlikely-fashion-pairing-ever

3/23/2022,"When police in Canada responded to reports of a car travelling at 150km per hour (93mph) on the wrong side of the road, they initially believed they had intercepted a drunk driver. So officers were surprised to discover that the driver was in fact an 11-year-old boy. On Sunday evening, the Durham regional police service received an emergency call about a possible drunk driver leaving a gas station in the city of Whitby, nearly an hour north-east of Toronto. As police headed to the vehicle’s registered address, a car sped by, well in excess of posted speed limits. “The officer activated their emergency equipment and made a U-turn to attempt to stop the vehicle,” Durham police said Monday. “A pursuit was initiated.” Officers chased the Hyundai along city streets and the car soon lost control, smashing through a fence and into a residential backyard. But moments later, the vehicle then returned to the road, almost hitting the police car head-on. A second police car was dispatched and the car was eventually “pinned” and forced to stop, but not before it smashed through another fence, according to police. The driver was reported to be 11 years old and his companion in the passenger seat was 12. No other details were released, but police say because of their ages, no charges will be laid. The driver was released to this mother on Sunday evening and the passenger to his father. Despite the high speeds of the chase, no injuries were reported but police say there was extensive damage to multiple fences as well as damage to the vehicle. The incident comes a year and a half after a 12-year-old boy commandeered his parent’s SUV and took it on a Toronto highway, weaving erratically through traffic in the early hours of the morning.",News/World news,"Speeding driver on wrong side of road was 11-year-old boy, Canada police say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/canada-speeding-driver-wrong-side-11-year-old

3/23/2022,"Several European countries lifted their coronavirus restrictions too soon, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said, and as a result are now witnessing sharp rises in infections probably linked to the new, more transmissible BA2 subvariant. Hans Kluge, director of the WHO’s Europe region, said countries including Germany, France, Italy and Britain had lifted their Covid curbs “brutally – from too much to too few”. Infections are rising in 18 out of the region’s 53 countries, he said. Kluge told journalists in Moldova on Tuesday that more than 5.1 million new cases – often linked to the BA2 variant, which experts say is about 30% more contagious – and 12,496 deaths have been reported in the region over the past seven days. “The countries where we see a particular increase are the United Kingdom, Ireland, Greece, Cyprus, France, Italy and Germany,” he said, adding that he nonetheless remained “optimistic but vigilant” about the pandemic’s progress in Europe. Health experts have said the surge is probably due to a range of factors including the reduced immunity offered by vaccines over time, the relatively high transmission rate of Omicron and its BA2 subvariant, and the relaxing of curbs such as mask wearing and vaccine passes for access to many indoor public places. WHO data shows the number of new Covid cases in Europe fell sharply from a peak at the end of January, but has been rising again since early March. In some countries, infection numbers are reaching new records even as most curbs are being lifted. Most pandemic controls were lifted in Germany’s “Freedom Day” on Sunday despite the seven-day rolling average of new daily cases per million hitting 2,619 on Saturday, the highest since the start of the pandemic more than two years ago. “The situation is much worse than the mood,” the health minister, Karl Lauterbach, warned. Austria last week reimposed the use of FFP2 masks indoors from Wednesday with its seven-day average per million standing at a record 4,985. The country’s health minister, Johannes Rauch, admitted the country had eased most restrictions too early, on 5 March. “A decline in the current figures is not expected until after the next few weeks,” the ministry said, regretting that that “the tense situation” would therefore be likely to last “much longer than previously expected”. Controls in France – including the requirement to wear masks in most indoor settings and a vaccine pass to access cafes, cinemas and restaurants – were lifted early last week, but its daily average per million has surged to 1,331 from 774 on 5 March. French authorities have said that for the time being the situation in the country’s hospitals was manageable, while the number of patients in intensive care and the number of daily coronavirus fatalities were going down. “For the past few days the number of people being admitted to hospital each day has stopped falling,” France’s health minister, Olivier Véran, acknowledged, adding that he expected to see the number of new infections “continue to rise until about the end of March, before falling back again in April”. Véran said there no “alarming signals” had so far been observed in intensive care wards in France. “The greatest risk is for people with underlying conditions and those who have not been fully vaccinated,” he said. “We are strongly advising them to continue wearing masks and to get their booster shot as soon as possible.” Italy announced last week that people would no longer have to show proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter indoor public spaces from 1 May, with outdoor venues exempt after 1 April and masks no longer required indoors from 30 April. The country’s seven-day average of new cases has, however, almost doubled since early March to 1,156 per million inhabitants. The equivalent figure in the UK has risen even more dramatically, from 398 at the end of February to 1,189 this weekend. Despite the rise in new infections, Kluge said Europe was in a relatively good position to cope with the virus. “There is a very large capital of immunity … either thanks to the vaccination or due to the infection,” he said, while the end of winter meant people would be less likely to gather in “small, crowded places”. Moreover, Omicron and its subvariant are known to cause milder symptoms in people who are fully vaccinated and have had a booster shot, he added – although he warned that in countries with a low vaccination rate, “this is still a disease that kills”. Kluge said the world would have to live with Covid “for quite a time, but that does not mean that we cannot get rid of the pandemic”. To be able to do so, he said, countries must protect vulnerable people, strengthen surveillance and sequencing, and make sure they had access to new antiviral medicines.

3/23/2022,"The UK is on the brink of agreeing a deal with the US to remove tariffs on British steel exports, ending months of tensions that had stood in the way of a broader bilateral trade agreement. The UK’s international trade minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, is due to meet her counterpart, US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo, on Tuesday evening in Baltimore, Maryland, to discuss the potential deal. British steel and aluminium companies that export to the US have faced tariffs of 25% and 10% respectively on their goods since 2018 when they were brought in by then president Donald Trump. The UK retaliated with equivalent levies on prominent American products such as Levi’s jeans, bourbon whiskey and Harley Davidson motorbikes. The US so-called section 232 tariffs were introduced under “national security” concerns and were part of Trump’s broader efforts to put pressure on trading partners. The UK steel industry reacted with alarm when the US agreed a deal with the EU to remove the Trump-era tariffs on European steel at the end of 2021, leaving British businesses at a disadvantage for months. Ministers are optimistic that the tariff dispute can be resolved soon, according to a government source. Trevelyan on Monday told the Daily Mail that she hoped the deal would open the way to a broader trade deal before the next election, as the government seeks to show some benefits from Brexit. A spokeswoman for the Department for International Trade said: “Since announcing the start of formal talks in January, we have made good progress towards agreeing a resolution on steel and aluminium tariffs. “Our objective remains for the US to lift section 232 tariffs promptly and clear the way for a thriving trading relationship.” Alasdair McDiarmid, operations director for the steelworkers’ union Community, said: “The news the US steel tariffs are being lifted is welcome, though we need to understand the full detail of the agreement. “To protect jobs our steelmakers must compete on a level playing field, and it is vital the UK does not suffer a further competitive disadvantage with EU producers. The EU secured their deal with the US back in October, so a UK-US deal is well overdue, and it must be implemented without delay to prevent further damage to our industry.” Steel companies and other heavy industrial users of large amounts of energy have also repeatedly called for help with energy prices, which were causing problems even before the recent surge in global energy prices – worsened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – which is threatening to knock the global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. However, the Treasury and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have previously resisted calls for more support for industry. Sunak is thought to be preparing action aimed at the consumer cost-of-living crisis in Wednesday’s spring statement, which would likely limit the government’s appetite for large-scale support for industry. McDiarmid said: “Britain’s steel industry is under huge pressure, and steelworkers are looking to the chancellor to take action to cut our unaffordable electricity prices.”",News/Politics,Britain closes in on deal with US to end tariffs on steel exports,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/22/britain-closes-in-on-deal-with-us-to-end-tariffs-on-steel-exports
3/23/2022,"US authorities appear closer to adding Roman Abramovich to its list of sanctioned hyper-rich Russians, after reports surfaced of a complex transaction of funds through a US hedge fund that was linked to the UK- and European-sanctioned owner of Chelsea football club. Abramovich, reputedly the one-time steward on Boris Yeltsin’s plane, and tapped by the then up-and-coming Vladimir Putin to manage Russian state-owned energy assets, was reported by the New York Times on Monday to be behind a $20m transfer from a shell company registered in the British Virgin Islands to an investment vehicle in the Cayman Islands controlled by a US hedge fund. According to the newspaper, the singular transfer was the culmination of months of work by “a small army of handlers and enablers in the United States, Europe and the Caribbean” that may have placed billions of dollars of Abramovich’s fortune with prominent US hedge funds and private equity firms. “In some cases, participants weren’t even aware of whose money they were helping to manage,” the Times reported. The transaction was organized by Concord Management, a US investment consultancy in White Plains, New York, that has been named as a vehicle through which the 55-year-old Abramovich may have invested $1.3bn with US financiers, including Empyrean Capital Partners in Los Angeles, Millstreet Capital Management in Boston, Millennium Management, Sarissa Capital Management and Sculptor Capital Management. Concord executive Michael Matlin issued a statement that described the firm as “a consulting firm that provides independent third-party research, due diligence and monitoring of investments”. The report comes days after a red flag alert was issued by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen), advising “all financial institutions to be vigilant against potential efforts to evade the expansive sanctions and other US-imposed restrictions implemented in connection with the Russian Federation’s further invasion of Ukraine”. “In the face of mounting economic pressure on Russia, it is vitally important for US financial institutions to be vigilant about potential Russian sanctions evasion, including by both state actors and oligarchs,” said Fincen acting director Him Das. The US government has also announced potential $5m payouts to Americans offering information leading to seizure of assets belonging to super-rich Russians, via the justice department kleptocracy taskforce. Abramovich, who is believed to be in Moscow, has not been placed on US sanctions lists, despite what is reported to be a frantic effort by him to sell funds via Concord on the secondary market since at least late February. One of his yachts, the 533-foot Eclipse, equipped with two swimming pools, helipads and a mini-submarine, is currently docked in New York. The EU imposed sanctions on Abramovich last week, saying his “privileged access” to Putin has “helped him to maintain his considerable wealth”. It followed similar penalties by the UK. Abramovich’s two superyachts, Bermuda-registered Eclipse and Solaris, are currently in Turkish waters, according to Reuters. Turkey has not agreed to follow or enforce UK and EU sanctions on Russian oligarchs, including Abramovich. But the Biden administration has identified his Gulfstream G650ER jet, considered one of the most prestigious in private aviation, for apparent violations of US export controls after it broke sanctions by flying to Moscow in recent weeks. Despite Abramovich not being named by the US, a number of US-based hedge funds have reportedly agreed to freeze his assets under guidance from the UK. “Currently, accounts attributed to Roman Abramovich are blocked from transacting. As such, any distributions, redemptions or payment cannot be made and no subscriptions or contributions can be accepted,” fund administrator SS&C Globe Op wrote. The report comes as the Internal Revenue Service has asked US legislators to approve more resources for the US sanctions program, and lawmakers push a bill, known as the Enablers Act, that would require investment advisers to identify and vet their customers. According to documents cited by BuzzFeed, the Concord advisory firm at the center of the 2012 Abramovich transaction, may have arranged more than 100 investments in different hedge funds and private equity firms, mostly for Abramovich. The outlet cited a 2015 and 2016 report by State Street, a financial services firm, that it had filed “suspicious activity reports” concerning transactions that Concord arranged involving some of Abramovich’s Caribbean shell companies.",News/World news,Abramovich could face US sanctions after hedge fund links revealed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/roman-abramovich-sanctions-us-hedge-fund-transfer
3/23/2022,"Tamara Tunie is limbering up to play the vice-president of America in Mike Bartlett’s new political satire, The 47th. “I have great admiration for what she’s achieved,” says Tunie, in a back office at the Old Vic in London, emanating a big, easygoing exuberance that seems Californian in spirit, although she is a New Yorker. So how is she preparing for the role of Kamala Harris: observing her public persona to mimic her convincingly? “No, I don’t try to impersonate – I find that could get in the way,” says Tunie, who appears utterly at ease with the part. Perhaps that’s because she is no stranger to playing true-life characters – including Whitney Houston’s mother, Cissy, in the upcoming biopic I Wanna Dance With Somebody. “I go to good old YouTube to see what interviews I can find,” she says of her research. “But what I look for more is the essence of the person: there might be one or two things that are significantly them – a quirk, something that they do. What I try to do is land on that but then allow myself the freedom to go: ‘What if they were in this situation?’” Bartlett’s drama finds Harris in 2024 in a world still dominated by the Trump family. It is a funny, horrifying political dystopia, much of it written in iambic pentameter with sly Shakespearean references tucked in. The reality of living through the Trump administration was sobering for Tunie. “This undercurrent of racism and misogyny was always there. What Trump allowed was the Pandora’s Box to be flung open … We must remain vigilant, and we must constantly fight, and we can never just relax and think ‘OK, everything is taken care of.’” Does she think America began relaxing during the Obama years? “Absolutely. The point when President Obama was elected was when the term ‘post-racial’ was coined. That was, unfortunately, a fantasy that everything was all fixed, because now we had a black president. What we are seeing – and one of the reasons I believe that Trump was elected – was that there was a backlash. In my circle we called it ‘black-lash’.” Tunie was born and raised in Pittsburgh, one of six siblings whose parents ran a funeral home. Her mother was also the first black female security guard at United States Steel and had a strong activist streak: “She believed that if there was something that needs to be addressed, you don’t wait for somebody else to do it.” Her father had a second job as an airport porter. Tunie was an all-rounder at school who loved singing and dancing but was fiercely academic, with ambitions to become a medic (she has played a medical examiner for more than 20 years in the TV drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit). What made her swerve into the performing arts was a single, thrilling moment, in the choir of a spring concert at high school. “I had a solo number and I got a standing ovation. It occurred to me that ‘This makes people really happy, it is something I love to do, and I can touch people with it.’” She won admission to the prestigious drama school at Carnegie Mellon University and made her Broadway debut in 1981. Feeling potentially pigeonholed as a musical performer, she stopped singing and dancing for a while. “I was classically trained. I wanted to do Shakespeare, I wanted to do straight plays, film and television. So for a good eight years or so I didn’t sing at all.” What was it like to return to singing for her part as Cissy Houston, one among a family of women with phenomenal voices, filmed last year? “Utterly intimidating. A lot of people don’t know that I sing, but the music that inspires me is in the jazz vein. Cissy Houston is more an amazing singer of gospel and R&B.” Tunie re-trained her vocals to “find” the character with the help of a musical team which included Rickey Minor, Whitney’s musical director. The 47th is the first live show Tunie has done since the beginning of the pandemic but she used the shutdown to build a campaign for better inclusivity within the theatre community. As part of Black Theatre United, the organisation which Tunie co-founded with fellow black professionals, a “New Deal for Broadway” was secured last year, which established industry-wide standards for equality, diversity, inclusion and accessibility. “This was a product of six months of meetings with the leaders in the industry: theatre owners, producers, creatives, casting directors. It is not a legal document but an agreement that is saying we as a community are going to address the exclusions of black people and make the industry much more inclusive.” Has she seen change more generally across screen and stage in recent years? Yes, but it has come very slowly and with a lot of pain. And even then it could flip back, she says, returning to her point about remaining vigilant. “But what I see in Hollywood are black individuals who have their own production companies, and black people making their own content, with Hollywood calling on them. There is Shonda Rhimes and the incredible dynasty she has built … I see that here, too [in the UK] – I worked with Michaela Coel in Black Earth Rising and she is very much the example of what I’m talking about.” On the subject of trailblazing women, has she ever met Harris? “I was on a Zoom with some other black women [during the presidential campaign] and she chatted with us, sharing some of her thoughts and policies for the future of the country. I found her utterly engaging.” So Harris for president? “As Jesse Jackson would say, ‘I keep hope alive.’ [To be vice-president] is a monumental accomplishment and I feel like it’s another rung in the ladder towards equality and space for not just a woman but a woman of colour to be the president of the United States. That would be the best thing for the country.” The 47th is at the Old Vic, London, from 29 March to 28 May.",Arts/Stage,‘I keep hope alive’: Tamara Tunie on playing Kamala Harris in political dystopia The 47th,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/22/i-keep-hope-alive-tamara-tunie-on-playing-kamala-harris-in-political-dystopia-the-47th
3/23/2022,"Stacey Abrams has filed a lawsuit seeking to immediately begin fundraising for her campaign for governor under a state law that prevents her gubernatorial leadership committee from doing so. Abrams is requesting to take advantage of a new kind of fundraising committee created by Georgia lawmakers last year, which her opponent, the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, has already been able to make use of. Called a leadership committee, it allows certain people and groups to accept unlimited contributions. Giving to direct candidate committees, on the other hand, is limited to $7,600 apiece for the primary and general elections and $4,500 for any runoff election. Under the law, the committees can be formed by the governor and lieutenant governor, opposing major party nominees, and both party caucuses in the state house and senate. The committees can coordinate with candidate campaigns, unlike most other political action committees. Although Georgia has not yet officially approved Abrams as the Democratic party nominee, Abrams argues that because no one filed to run against her in the 24 May Democratic primary and because write-in votes are not allowed, she became the nominee when qualifying closed. “Ms Abrams – the sole qualified and declared Democratic candidate for Governor of Georgia – and her campaign committee will be unable to operate, control, chair, or otherwise use One Georgia, a leadership committee … to support her campaign without credible and justified threat and fear of legal proceedings being instituted against Plaintiffs,” the lawsuit said. “As a direct consequence, Plaintiffs will suffer ongoing and irreparable injury to their ability to use political speech to advocate for Ms Abrams’s campaign, especially compared to her chief opponent, sitting Governor Brian P Kemp.” Georgia has not yet approved Abrams’s leadership due to disputes over whether she qualified as a nominee before the primary, even though the state’s Democratic party chair, representative Nikema Williams, has recognized her candidacy and recognized Abrams as the sole nominee. In an affidavit, Williams wrote, “The only candidate who qualified with DPG [Democratic Party of Georgia] to run for the office of Governor of the State of Georgia prior to the end of the 2022 candidate qualifying period on March 11, 2022 is Stacey Y Abrams.” Abrams said in court pleadings that when a lawyer for her contacted the state ethics commission to confirm that her leadership committee could begin raising and spending money before 24 May, a commission lawyer said Adams’s legal team first needed to seek legal advice from Georgia’s attorney general, Chris Carr, and secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, as to whether state law considers Abrams the nominee. In the absence of any further clarification since, Abrams’s team filed the lawsuit seeking a temporary order to be allowed to raise money right away. Meanwhile, Kemp created the Georgians First leadership committee after signing the law and had raised $2.3m through January. Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams’s campaign manager, said that Kemp’s early fundraising advantage causes “severe harm” to the fairness of the election. “Early fundraising supports later fundraising by demonstrating a candidate’s political viability and widespread appeal, particularly in a high-dollar statewide election in a swing state like Governor of Georgia,” she wrote.",News/US news,Stacey Abrams files lawsuit after being blocked from fundraising for Georgia governor campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/22/stacey-abrams-lawsuit-fundraising-campaign-georgia-governor

PSG’s monthly wage bill is said to be nearly 10 times higher than the Ligue Urrrn average, which makes last weekend’s 3-0 defeat by Monaco, admittedly no lovable urchins themselves, all the more rum. PSG are not, of course, the reigning champions, since they lost the title last season to Lille, who also beat them in the French equivalent of the Charidee Shield. That was before Nice knocked them out of the Coupe de France, and also before they soiled their special Big Cup pants in front of the whole world in Madrid.

3/23/2022,"An inquiry into Victoria’s “undemocratic” upper-house voting system is likely to be shelved until after the election. Victoria’s Legislative Council is the only jurisdiction in Australia where group voting tickets are still allowed. Under the system, voters choose just one party above the line on the ballot paper, after which their preferences are allocated by the party. Voters can vote below the line – but less than 9% did so at the 2018 state election. In 2020, Victorian parliament’s Electoral Matters Committee considered the upper house and group voting problem in its review of the 2018 election. The Labor-chaired committee said proposed changes “involve serious and complex issues” that could “potentially have significant consequences for the makeup of Victoria’s parliament” and recommended a separate inquiry be held. Guardian Australia has spoken to several members of the committee, who doubt an inquiry will go ahead before the 26 November election. Asked about the potential reforms, Victorian government spokesperson said: “The government has no plans to change the upper house voting system.” ABC election analyst Antony Green said group voting tickets have been exploited by “preference whisperers”, who are paid to help candidates win despite receiving a small proportion of first-preference votes. “It is inconceivable, it is absolutely impossible for some of these parties elected under group voting tickets to get elected under their own steam,” he said. “They are entirely and utterly dependent on preference negotiations and because they make the ballot paper so big and so complex, voters just use the ticket and then someone else determines the outcome.” Even preference whisperer Glenn Druery expected voting reform after the 2018 election. Druery worked with eight of the 11 crossbenchers elected. They included Transport Matters Party’s Rod Barton, who holds the title for being elected in Victoria with the smallest number of first preference votes: 2,508 out of 418,532 votes or 0.6%. Eight micro parties directed their third preferences – their first preference after their own two candidates – to Barton. In the South Eastern Metropolitan region, Liberal Democrat David Limbirck won a seat with 0.84% of the first preference vote. Sustainable Australia’s Clifford Hayes won a seat in the Southern Metropolitan Region with 1.32% of first preference votes, ending Greens MP Sue Pennicuik’s 12-year career. Pennicuik received about 13% of first preference votes. Green described the process as akin to a “lottery”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It is an absolute abrogation of democracy to conduct elections under a format where a small cabal of people engage in swapping preferences, which completely undermines the will of the electorate,” he said. But Limbirck said parties other than Labor, the Liberals and the Greens received about 22% of first preferences votes in the upper house, with the chamber largely reflecting that. “There is a high level of diversity within the upper house and I think that it works,” he said. Late last year, Western Australia became the latest jurisdiction to abolish group voting tickets after the Daylight Saving party won a seat with just 98 first preference votes, or 0.2% of the vote, and the Legalise Cannabis party won another with 2% at the March poll. One Victorian MP said there was no appetite for reform given the government has successfully worked with crossbenchers to pass legislation and would not want to hand more seats to the Greens, who are their main rivals in several inner Melbourne lower house seats. However, Geoffrey Robinson, a senior lecturer in politics at Deakin University said the government may have changed their stance given the Greens willingness to work with them throughout the pandemic. “Members of what you could call the ‘micro party right’ on the crossbench have been incredibly hostile to Labor throughout Covid-19,” he said. “So you have to wonder if that experience may bias Labor towards working with the Greens – or at the very least preferencing them over other parties.” Victorian Greens Leader Samantha Ratnam conceded her party would probably be the main beneficiary of the reform. “But that’s because people voted for us. It’s not because we’ve gamed the system. We get about 10% of the vote,” she said. Last year, Ratnam wrote to the committee urging them to initiate such an inquiry, but they declined to do so. She also moved an amendment to electoral reform legislation last month to abolish group voting tickets but didn’t receive support from any other MPs. “It’s unbelievable that the Victorian Labor government won’t embrace reform that will lead to a healthier democracy and for voters’ views to be represented in the parliament because that’s what this is fundamentally about,” Ratnam said. Green predicts without reform the 2022 Victorian upper house ballot paper will be “stacked with minor parties”, including those that are anti-vaccination. “Prior to reform, the 2013 Senate ballot paper was so big they started issuing magnifying glasses. Victoria might have that at this election, there’s a strong chance that all the ballot papers will be doubled decked because they’ll have so many parties,” Green said. “I imagine we’ll also have multiple anti-vax parties.” It’s a concern shared by Ratnam. “We know with the voting system in Victoria it’s quite possible that those groups could get elected because you need a fraction of the vote and you can have a seat in parliament and that is so dangerous,” she said. “We’re really worried about the impact that will have on the health of democracy in Victoria.” Robinson believes abolishing group voting tickets does not go far enough. He said the state’s upper house should be a single electorate rather than five, like in New South Wales. It would mean the quota for election is small, guaranteeing the representation of minor parties. “Having a statewide system will ensure a more accurate representation and enable some genuine micro parties to get a say,” he said.",News/Australia news,‘Preference whisperers’: Reforms to group voting tickets in Victoria likely to be delayed until after election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/preference-whisperers-reforms-to-group-voting-unlikely-to-happen-before-victorian-election
3/23/2022,"The outgoing Labor MP for Parramatta, Julie Owens, has expressed disappointment at her party’s plans to parachute a celebrity candidate into her western Sydney seat, saying local branch preselections are “the way it should be”. Labor is moving to install former Kevin Rudd adviser and economist Andrew Charlton as the party’s candidate in the marginal seat ahead of the upcoming federal election, prompting an outpouring of anger from branch members who want a preselection ballot to replace Owens. Owens, who is retiring at the next election after 18 years in the seat, told the Guardian she understood the disappointment of local members, saying she believed a rank and file preselection was “the best way to go”. “What I can say is the branches have worked incredibly hard in the last 18 years,” she said. “The branches have really been a major part of serving the electorate of Parramatta and they actually should have a say. “I’ve said before one of the great strengths of our democracy is that our leaders are chosen by people who know them. I firmly believe my branch members are in the best position to decide on who the best person to replace me in Parramatta is.” Charlton is a former Rhodes scholar who served as an economics adviser to Rudd, and sources in the Labor party have confirmed he is being considered for the seat, with the national executive poised to endorse him this week. But local members are understood to be furious with the decision. Charlton currently lives in a $16m home in the wealthy suburb of Bellevue Hill in Sydney’s east, about 30km away from the seat of Parramatta. While it’s understood he grew up in the western Sydney suburb of Dundas, the choice of a captain’s pick in the seat comes just months after Labor announced Senator Kristina Keneally as the party’s candidate in Fowler in Sydney’s south-west, side-stepping local branch members. At the time Keneally was a resident of the exclusive suburb of Scotland Island, though it’s understood she has since relocated to a rental property in Liverpool. The Guardian has previously reported that local branch members had expressed their discontent, with reports the party was considering installing a candidate after a standoff between sub-factions in the party’s left. In February the Guardian reported that the branch’s federal electoral committee had passed two separate motions calling for a rank and file ballot, while James Shaw, the local secretary, had written to Labor leader Anthony Albanese and general secretary, Bob Nanva, calling for a local preselection. Part of the anger comes from a desire to select a candidate who, branch members say, better represents the diverse electorate of Parramatta, which Labor holds on a margin of 3.5%. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Local candidates including Abha Devasia, a union lawyer of Indian background, and solicitor Durga Owen, a Tamil refugee from Sri Lanka, had been considering running for the seat. While Owens did not want to comment on who should be preselected to replace her, she said that “generally speaking” the parliament needed to increase its diversity. “We’ve got a long way to go across the board, not just Labor,” she said. “I’m cautious about saying anyone should be picked in any one place but as a general principle we need to work much harder to make sure parliament looks like the rest of the country. “When you turn the television on you should see ‘us’, and I think for some people you turn the television on and you see ‘them’.” While the Labor party has declined to comment publicly, Owens said she believed local branch members were best placed to choose her replacement through a rank and file ballot. “That’s the way it should be,” she said. “It doesn’t always work out that way unfortunately and when it doesn’t the branch members are rightfully upset about that because it’s true that they know the area. “They’ve been with me through door-knocking 76,000 homes. For every home there was always at least three branch members with me. I wouldn’t have been able to serve Parramatta in the way I did unless I was able to do that.”",News/Australia news,Outgoing Parramatta MP disappointed by Labor plan to parachute Andrew Charlton into her seat,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/outgoing-parramatta-mp-disappointed-by-labor-plan-to-parachute-andrew-charlton-into-her-seat
3/23/2022,"When Australia’s east coast was recently devastated by floods, everyone was debating about who needed to do what and the radio crackled with the sound of discontent – a voice broke through all of that saying something like “the people need us, so we are going”. It was at once such a simple and pragmatic statement of fact that was impossible to ignore. The voice belonged to Dr Daniel Nour, mostly unknown until his recognition as the 2022 Young Australian of the Year. Two years ago, after an eye-opening experience on the streets of London during a medical elective, Nour founded the Street Side Medics; a charity that provides medical care to the homeless. It’s a mobile van (soon to be two) with healthcare professionals equipped with a pharmacy and point-of-care testing to meet and serve homeless people where they are. A lack of judgment, the understanding of the many paths to homelessness (including extreme weather events) paired with a welcoming attitude that requires no proof of identity are some of the key values of this young charity. I realised that I was particularly struck by Nour’s words that day on the radio because I had spent the morning with medical students eager to discuss their future. Among the budding neurologists and cardiologists, there were plastic surgeons and sports physicians. Finally, the quietest student – and to my mind the most impressive – spoke. Her grandmother was a GP, getting on in age but so well-loved by her patients that every day at work felt like a gift. She could be content with just that life, she smiled, as I hurried to correct the false and pervasive impression that there was anything “just” about being a GP. Aspiring doctors in the rich world want to do many things but mostly end up doing one – becoming a specialist in a large city. They lament the corporate nature and the fragmentation of the field of medicine but are soon engulfed by the system. An ounce of passion is drowned in an ocean of regulations because the establishment, conservative by nature, does not have a great appetite for change. It is not that those who enter medicine don’t want to help the disadvantaged, homeless or otherwise vulnerable – indeed, many think this would be a life ideally spent. The fact that so few end up doing this is because well, it is not considered a “path”, as much as an indulgence. As a young doctor when I dared tell my boss that I volunteered at a refugee clinic, he admonished me to do something useful. Stunned at the time, I have since realised that he meant well but genuinely didn’t appreciate how the experience of a refugee clinic could help me succeed in the way he defined it, namely in terms of grants won and papers written. What I wished he understood was that volunteering did not dilute my potential, rather it enhanced my world view. Ironically, it was that experience that gave me a foundation for understanding the complex lives of the refugees and asylum seekers I treat today. In the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic that has exposed many health inequities, a central tension in the field of medicine seems even more pronounced – how to honour purpose while meeting exacting standards of efficiency. The hospital is a revolving door for patients who don’t receive the holistic care they deserve. Less time with a GP (if one is available) means less discourse and less problem-solving, leading to a slew of costly complications down the track. Healthcare professionals haven’t lost their ability to know what a patient needs but they feel thwarted meeting those needs. It’s inexplicable that a patient might get the very expensive and unnecessary scan but not the counsellor who could offer her life-changing advice. Or that an emergency department might save the patient from an overdose and then send him right back to the dangerous streets. The insidious thing about medicine is that when you are constantly turning away people in need or offering them less or making excuses to yourself as to why they are not getting the care they deserve, you eventually become convinced it is enough, inevitable and acceptable. When patients with a critical illness face agonising delays in the public system but not in the private sector, somehow, the problem of affordability becomes theirs. When we lower our standards, we let ourselves down as well as our patients. In such times, we need beacons of moral clarity like Nour to remind us to do better and be better. Last month, the world lost Dr Paul Farmer; an extraordinary doctor and public health physician committed to global health equity. In a fine essay in the New England Journal of Medicine, my colleague Lisa Rosenbaum, recalled his footprint that spread from Harvard to Haiti and Rwanda. Farmer rejected the mindset of clinical nihilism that holds patients responsible for the miserable conditions that imperil their treatment. In Haiti, when many blamed the spiritual beliefs for non-compliance with tuberculosis therapy, Farmer ran a trial showing that patients who received medication as well as economic assistance, transport and community health visits had a 100% cure rate compared to 57% in the standard care (free medication only) group. Farmer was a prolific scholar who rejected the arrogance and orthodoxy of academia. What distinguished him, however, were not the papers and plaudits, but his genuine care for people apparent in his dealings. He made the time to sit by his dying patients and to check in on colleagues. Where medical training cautions against becoming emotionally involved with patients, he warned that this detachment could trap one into thinking that suffering was acceptable. He argued that without direct exposure to the ill and suffering, it was hard to formulate good policy. Doctors like Paul Farmer and Daniel Nour remind us of the rightful place of social justice in the world of medicine. Their work moves us because it shatters the assumption that one doctor alone cannot start a movement for change. They teach us that there is a role each person can play through volunteering, advocacy and sometimes choosing to take the path less travelled. Admittedly, it’s not for everyone, but I can’t help thinking that many doctors would find the alternatives more satisfying than what is served up as modern medicine. The healing profession contains many ways to fulfil our duty to patients and Farmer and Nour should not be an exception. When those who spot a gap in the healthcare system and steps up to use their social conscience to address it, we must not ask why but rather, why not.",Opinion/Opinion,Why is it judged an indulgence when doctors help the disadvantaged? ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/22/why-is-it-judged-an-indulgence-when-doctors-help-the-disadvantaged
3/23/2022,"Northern Territory police constable Zachary Rolfe was investigated for perjury after a judge said he had lied about his actions during the violent arrest of an Aboriginal man in Alice Springs, newly released court documents show. But police found there was insufficient evidence to charge Rolfe and another officer with perjury in relation to evidence they gave about the 2018 arrest of Malcolm Ryder. On 11 March, a jury unanimously found Rolfe not guilty of the murder of Kumanjayi Walker, and of two alternative charges, in relation to a shooting at the remote community of Yuendumu in November 2019. His defence team successfully argued prior to his trial that allegations about his conduct during other arrests was not admissible as evidence, in part because no findings of wrongdoing had been made against Rolfe and the judge found they were not relevant to the shooting. David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, said in a court hearing regarding the evidence that his client had been cleared by his supervisors of using inappropriate force. Following Rolfe’s acquittal the court lifted suppression orders and released hundreds of pages of documents relating to the pre-trial application, including the Ryder case. Ryder was charged with hindering Rolfe in executing his duties as a police officer and unlawfully assaulting Rolfe after an incident at Ryder’s house in Alice Springs. But a judge in the Northern Territory local court dismissed the charges against Ryder and found his version of events – that Rolfe had punched him in the face and then slammed his head into the ground, leaving him unconscious and in a pool of blood during the arrest – was the “more likely” version of how the injuries occurred than the evidence provided by Rolfe. Internal police documents also reveal that even though a subsequent investigation found insufficient evidence for a criminal prosecution for perjury over Rolfe’s evidence in Ryder, it was recommended his conduct be reviewed by professional standards command, the NT police division which investigates disciplinary breaches and unprofessional behaviour. The documents do not indicate whether this was done or whether any further action was taken. The documents also reveal that four officers who were involved in the Ryder arrest but were not under investigation declined to provide further statutory declarations to the detective investigating Rolfe for possible perjury, after the officers sought advice from the Northern Territory police association. At Ryder’s trial in the Alice Springs local court, the court heard Rolfe and five other officers had attended Ryder’s house after a report of a disturbance and sought to arrest his stepson. Ryder was alleged to have interfered in this attempt by attacking police. The stepson was not charged with any offence. But in May 2019, Judge Greg Borchers found Ryder not guilty, and strongly criticised Rolfe’s evidence in the case, including claims that Ryder had thrown punches, as “unreliable”. The newly released documents show that in 2019, officers investigating the matter sent files to another police department seeking advice on the prospects of a perjury prosecution. But the internal communication showed NT superintendent Richard Bryson, from judicial operations, advised the officer investigating Rolfe and another officer involved that “in my view it is unhelpful to present the files at their current standard” to the director of public prosecutions. He said: “What is more important here is the member’s knowledge and motivation for saying ‘A’ in circumstances where the true situation appears to have been ‘B’. “We don’t know anything about that knowledge or motivation because the members have never been asked since the incident in question almost two years ago.” Bryson continued that it appeared “undue reliance” was being placed on the judge’s comments, when there was no evidence before him that Rolfe or another officer lied or fabricated evidence. “My reading of the material on file more properly demonstrates that the members actions as being unprofessional, not criminal,” Bryson wrote. “The members at the time were extremely junior and inexperienced … the material demonstrates that the members don’t know their powers, their evidence was poorly given, and they do not appear to have been properly briefed by the prosecutor. “All of which appears to have led to the inevitable outcome.” Bryson makes clear more work needs to be done, saying the files “demonstrate little in the way of actual investigation” or “cogent admissible evidence”. “The resources of this office and that of the DPP to provide considered opinions are finite and should not be wasted reviewing material that clearly is short of the benchmark.” On 21 February 2020, an investigator sent a further memorandum to the superintendent of the crime division, outlining additional steps taken to progress the investigation since Bryson provided his opinion. The memorandum makes clear that despite the investigator gathering further information there was not enough evidence for Rolfe or the other officer to be charged. He says that investigators had obtained more information, and sought further statutory declarations from four officers involved in the Ryder arrest, who “declined to provide them after seeking advice from NTPA”. Police also sought a statutory declaration from Borchers, but he declined this request, telling police to refer to the transcript of his decision. He said Rolfe was not asked to be interviewed. “The file is not able to progress to a standard beyond its initial submission … no significant discrepancy between the testimonies of the police has been identified,” the investigator wrote. “There remains no reasonable prospect of conviction.” But he said material gathered during the investigation gave “rise to potential disciplinary breaches and unprofessional behaviour” and he therefore recommended the file be sent to professional standards command for review. The documents do not indicate if this occurred.

3/23/2022,"It was a given that the Australian spin-off of US maritime reality show Below Deck would feature some local flair. But when Channel Seven news footage from 2019 popped up halfway through the first episode of Below Deck Down Under, I was surprised and absolutely on board. Nine years ago Bravo released Below Deck, a reality show about the crew working on luxury yachts, catering to the charter guests’ every whim in an effort to attain the elusive big tip. The show is a treasure chest of reality TV subgenres: it’s a travel show, it’s a cooking show, it’s the youthful mess of early Vanderpump Rules (crew) and the narcissistic wealth and schadenfreude of The Real Housewives (guests). It’s class politics, service industry hierarchies, tourism and melodrama. And it’s all on a boat! Below Deck has launched a fleet of spin-offs: Below Deck Mediterranean, Below Deck Sailing Yacht and now, Below Deck Down Under, recorded on Queensland’s shores and following the crew of superyacht Thalassa. It’s all a bit Downton Abbey: downstairs are the crew’s matchbox-sized living quarters, kitchen and crew mess; upstairs on deck is the glamorous dining room, jacuzzi and luxury guest suites. After each charter, the crew let off steam on crazy nights out, with this season filmed on Airlie Beach. The formula is standard across the franchise, with each spin-off featuring some familiar faces and a mostly rotating crew each season (or even during the season). The central unchanging force is the series captain, and this time we get Captain Jason Chambers, with his broad Aussie accent and laid-back “I’m more of a big brother than a captain” attitude. In an effort to distinguish Captain Jason from the rest, he’s introduced as a hands-on hottie, very much in control of Thalassa as it charters the Whitsundays. So when old news footage of a 45.6-metre yacht he was captaining was shown crashing into a marina, I was overjoyed. No one was hurt and Captain Jason saved the day. But to me, it was a perfect moment for a Australian spin-off of a popular US show: is there anything we love more than watching a slow-motion crash? And now we get one at our own marina. In over 260 episodes of the Below Deck franchise, there have been countless personal and professional crashes involving crew, captains and clients. (And only a couple as literal as Jason’s.) Kicking the season off, Captain Jason endures another mechanical failure, this time one that means Thalassa can’t even leave the dock. While the captain tries to sort the issue, it’s up to the band of international yachties on board to keep guests entertained and happy. The crew is what makes or breaks Below Deck, no matter the location or spin-off. How they respond to charter guests, and each other, is where the drama thrives. Most of the Down Under crew are green, but Below Deck Med alum (and fan favourite) Aesha Scott is back. The chief stew is undoubtedly the shining star of Below Deck Down Under, with her Kiwi sense of humour, optimism and no-shit talking giving the series the vibe it was longing for with Captain Jason. Enter her foil: American chef Ryan McKeown, whose self-professed arrogance clashes Aesha’s service-first approach, already brewing a combustible level of conflict. But that’s not the only personality clash set up. On the first crew night out, while the alcohol is flowing and the hot tub being used by those who normally clean it, bosun Jamie has an outburst after discovering one of the female crew members already has a boyfriend. “I’ve just been told [that] every girl on the fucking boat has a boyfriend, apparently,” he says, adding that he is “not interested” in anyone else on the boat. It is uncomfortable to watch. Similarly, it is hard to see deckhand Benny being given a “you can do better” award by the captain in front of his colleagues, wearing a disco ball helmet as a kind of humiliation. The captain and crew say it is all in good fun, but it’s hard not to see this busting someone’s balls style of management under the guise of jocular larrikinism as a classic taste of Aussie punch-down workplace culture. We’re yet to see any truly heinous or demanding guests, but the setup for “crashes” is strong. Like a superyacht careering into a marina, there’s no stopping Below Deck Down Under now. The first episodes of Below Deck Down Under are available to stream on Hayu in Australia and on Peacock in the US",Arts/Television & radio,"Below Deck Down Under review – it’s Downton Abbey on a boat, what more could you want?",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/23/below-deck-down-under-review-its-downton-abbey-on-a-boat-what-more-could-you-want
3/23/2022,"Newcastle residents whose homes were showered in asbestos fragments and other materials after a massive warehouse fire in early March say they are dismayed by the New South Wales government’s response to the disaster. Three weeks after the fire broke out in an old wool store in the inner Newcastle suburb of Wickham, a primary school remains closed as authorities deal with the cleanup. Frustrated residents in Wickham, Islington, Maryville and other nearby suburbs that fell under the smoke plume say they have had to push for assistance amid “appalling” communication from authorities. Fire crews were called to the large blaze on Annie Street on 1 March. Thick smoke could be seen from nearby suburbs and the immediate concern for fire crews was the building’s proximity to a number of fuel tanks so close to residential areas. The fire was so ferocious it destroyed two wool stores at the site and caused the asbestos roofing of both warehouses to explode, scattering debris over homes and reaching more than three kilometres to the west. Islington public school remains closed due to the contamination, and the top layer of grass and soil in some of its playgrounds has had to be dug up and removed. Other public facilities, including a park and Tafe sites, have been intermittently closed for cleaning. But residents say they have struggled to get clear information from authorities about what to do in their own homes, and aired their frustrations at two public meetings organised by the state Labor MP Tim Crakanthorp. Multiple attenders later described the response from officials as “defensive”. The Public Works Advisory has told residents that consistent air monitoring in the immediate and surrounding areas has returned negative results for airborne asbestos, “confirming that there is no airborne health risk”, a spokesperson said. Bronwyn McDonald is an Islington resident who works for the Wilderness Society. She lives with her partner, Max Menyhart, and two young children in a house that was showered with debris ranging “from the size of my fingertips to my palm and larger than my hand” on the day of the fire. “There were chunks of asbestos that were fibrous, paint flecks, lots of charred debris and black and white dust,” McDonald said. “It was everywhere, on the cars, on the footpath, our grass and plants, the veranda, the concrete area of the yard and the garden.” She said authorities appeared to have organised clean ups of public spaces, but the response in residential areas had been poorly coordinated and lacked clear communication about which government agency was in charge. Residents learned through social media and word of mouth that they were required to report to the Environment Protection Authority if their home had been affected in order to organise a clean by public works. Several were later sent a deed of release that asked them to acknowledge that Public Works Advisory and other NSW government agencies “have no legal liability for the presence of any asbestos in the property”. The form also asked residents to agree that government authorities should not have to pay “claims, costs, losses, damages and liabilities”. McDonald and Menyhart organised a private clean of their home and briefly moved out but have since returned and will also have the home cleaned by public works. “We’ve absolutely been worried every single day since this has happened,” McDonald said. “I have concerns that my kids have incidentally inhaled asbestos. “For me it’s been hugely worrying that they’re reacting in public spaces where they have legal responsibility but there’s been very little response on whether we should be worried in our private residences.” McDonald said she was concerned for residents unaware they needed to formally request a clean, and for those who were renting. She was also worried vacant properties would be missed. Menyhart door-knocked homes in their neighbourhood and found several people who did not know their properties required cleaning. Will Sherman lives with his wife and six-year-old daughter on a street in Islington about 450 metres from the wool stores. He was driving his daughter home from school at the time of the fire. “We got home and I thought it was hailing but that turned out to be chunks of asbestos and debris landing on our roof,” he said. Sherman said authorities had emphasised at the meetings that monitoring showed no airborne asbestos and that the recent heavy rain had helped suppress any fibres. But at the same time the school and parks had been closed and some people’s green bins had been taped up and taken away. “The level and type of communication has been appalling,” he said. “Apart from concern about health issues, I feel really let down and extremely stressed.” The confusion for residents in the aftermath has been compounded by the fact that properties are being prioritised for cleaning in different ways. Buildings within 100 metres of the blast are being cleaned externally and internally. But residents who live further away, such as McDonald and Sherman, have been told only the exterior of their homes will be cleaned and this will not include the roof. This has led to concern that fragments of asbestos that remain on the roofs will be dispersed when the wind picks up. Kath Fielden is a solicitor who lives with her two teenage daughters on Lewis Street in Islington, about 300 metres from the wool stores. On the day of the fire, they were all at home with their windows and doors open for ventilation as her eldest daughter had Covid. Fielden describes hearing a bang, followed by a rush of heat and fragments similar to coarse river sand. “The next day I found five cent piece-sized particles of asbestos in the house,” she said. Fielden has registered for a clean but is angry it will exclude the interior of the home and the roof. “I feel anxious in my house.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Terry Slevin is the chief executive of the Public Health Association of Australia and previously chaired the Cancer Council Australia’s occupational and environmental cancer committee. He said asbestos disturbance caused by major emergencies such as fire and flood was common and it was “difficult to know with any precision” the level of health risk it created. He said this was why it was crucial authorities provided clear information to residents. “It’s important that people don’t think that if there is some presence of asbestos around their properties that it will automatically result in them or anyone in their family having an asbestos-related disease,” Slevin said. A spokesperson for Public Works Advisory said there had been a coordinated response for two weeks, including consistent air monitoring. They said the response was initially led by emergency services but the recovery phase was “being supported by [the] EPA and PWA in managing the clean up”. “The approach to clean-up has been guided [by] assessing the deposits of destroyed roof material found through extensive surveys of the neighbourhood and streets in the direction of the smoke plume,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said 392 people had registered as being affected and assessors had also door-knocked residents in areas near the fire. Of those registered, 200 properties had been assessed as requiring environmental cleaning, which had been now been completed at 183 of those properties. The most exposed area included the adjacent apartment blocks where residents were evacuated, the spokesperson said. Those areas were being extensively cleaned. The spokesperson said the deed of release document was to obtain the owner’s permission for the clean and “clarify legal responsibilities”.",News/Australia news,‘Appalling’: Newcastle residents question response after wool store fire showers homes with asbestos,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/appalling-newcastle-residents-question-response-after-wool-store-fire-showers-homes-with-asbestos
3/23/2022,"The Australian War Memorial is being pressed to stop accepting money from Lockheed Martin when its current sponsorship deal ends next month, due to the company’s involvement in nuclear weapons and surging share price following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The AWM’s acceptance of funding from arms manufacturers like Boeing, Thales, BAE, and Lockheed Martin has caused significant controversy in recent years and prompted criticism from former AWM leaders, including former directors and long-serving principal historian Prof Peter Stanley. In recent weeks, ex-employees, veterans, historians and academics have written to the AWM urging it to end its association with Lockheed Martin when the current deal concludes next month, saying companies that profit from conflict “have no place in a solemn memorial honouring people killed in the carnage of war”. New polling suggests such concerns are held widely in the community. The polling – commissioned by the Medical Association for Prevention of War (MAPW) and conducted by Ipsos – asked respondents whether they agreed with the statement that “the war memorial should not accept money from companies that profit from the sale of weapons”. More than half (59%) of the nationally representative sample either agreed or strongly agreed. After being told Lockheed Martin was involved in the manufacture of nuclear weapons, respondents were also asked whether they agreed the AWM “should not accept money from companies that produce weapons of mass destruction”. About two-thirds either agreed or strongly agreed. Only 9% disagreed or strongly disagreed. The association’s president, Dr Sue Wareham, wrote to the AWM director, Matt Anderson, last month urging him to cease the arrangement with Lockheed Martin. Wareham said Lockheed Martin made more revenue from warfare than any other company in the world. “The AWM cannot properly lead the remembrance and understanding of Australia’s wartime experience whilst benefiting, through financial relationships with weapons companies, from the conduct of those very wars,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In response, Anderson pointed to a podcast that Lockheed Martin had sponsored, which told the stories of Australian veterans, including their experiences of post-traumatic stress disorder. “Lockheed Martin’s sponsorship of the podcast is entirely consistent with the memorial’s mission to lead remembrance and understanding of Australia’s wartime experience’,” he wrote. “The Australian War Memorial values the support of our corporate partners. It assists in the development of the memorial’s galleries, exhibitions, programs, staffing and our national collection.” The AWM has also received pleas from more than a dozen historians, veterans and experts, urging it to abandon the deal when it ceases in early April. Dr Greg Lockhart, a historian and Vietnam war veteran, told the AWM its role was completely at odds with that of Lockheed Martin, which profits from war. He said the company’s stocks had soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The AWM’s connection with Lockheed Martin is a shocking affront to its stated purpose and represents a loss of principled direction,” he wrote.

When it expires in early April that must be the end of it!” Stanley, who was the AWM’s principal historian for 27 years, wrote: “The memorial continuing to seek and accept commercial sponsorship from arms companies like Lockheed Martin remains a serious blemish on its reputation and character as a commemorative institution.” In a statement to the Guardian, Anderson said all sponsorship agreements were crucial in developing “exhibitions and programs that could not otherwise have been delivered without third party funding support”. “The memorial creates and delivers these projects independently and maintains full editorial control over content,” he said. “The podcast series Up Close – Conversations with modern veterans has allowed veterans to speak about consequences of their operational service and the personal impacts of deployments.

3/23/2022,"Plans to build Queensland’s first new dam in more than a decade – the Emu Swamp dam in the Granite Belt – have been thrown into limbo by a construction cost blowout, Guardian Australia has learned. The 12,000 megalitre dam on the Severn River was initially slated to cost $84m, with most of the funding provided by the federal government ($47m) and Queensland government ($13.6m). The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has been a longstanding supporter. But a Guardian Australia investigation has discovered that estimates for construction of the dam have more than doubled – to more than $200m – leaving the proponent with a significant funding shortfall. That proponent is Granite Belt Water Ltd, a company made up mainly of local irrigators, which had planned to spend about $23.4m on the project. Overall, about 50 farmers agreed to effectively buy into the scheme in exchange for rights to an annual water allocation. But the Guardian understands some of those irrigators have since ceased their involvement with the project, claiming it is now unviable. Opponents of the project – including some local residents and operators of small farms – say taxpayer funds should be spent on alternative water security measures, not a dam privately owned and run by large-scale irrigators. In early 2020, the nearby town of Stanthorpe came within weeks of running out of water. The local council, Southern Downs regional council, had plans to raise the wall of Storm King dam, which supplies town water, and had a 450 megalitre water allocation set aside for the project. “This water is reserved for the future urban growth of Stanthorpe and cannot be compromised,” the council said in 2018. But in late 2020, a newly elected council reversed that position and voted to transfer the reserve allocation to the proposed Emu Swamp Dam. At the same time, the council effectively bought into Emu Swamp, agreeing to buy back 585 megalitres a year once the dam was constructed. Documents seen by Guardian Australia show that irrigators secured annual water allocations by agreeing to contribute to the capital cost of the dam at a rate of $6,000 a megalitre. Irrigators also agreed to pay $405 a megalitre for water on an ongoing basis – four times the cost of using recycled water from a local scheme. Maryanne Slattery, a former Murray-Darling Basin Authority member and water researcher, said few crops would be viable at that price. “It’s hard to imagine you’re making enough profit at that amount,” Slattery said. While the project would be owned and run by local irrigators, the vast majority of the funding to build the dam was originally to come from government handouts, with the federal government committing $47m through the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, alongside irrigator contributions of $23.4m and the Queensland government’s promise of $13.6m. Earlier this month, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, told state parliament the project was at a “planned pause phase”, but that “we have … invested money in the project because we know how it could transform the region”. Leading Nationals, including Joyce and the federal agriculture minister, David Littleproud, who is also the local MP, have been longstanding supporters of Emu Swamp. There are already signs that delays to progress at Emu Swamp will be a source of political jostling at the upcoming federal election. This government is all about giving the appearance of action but not taking any.On Budget night 2020, the Treasurer included Emu Swamp Dam in his speech.But after the Palaszczuk govt had agreed to fund it, the Feds took another year to send through the paperwork. It is unclear whether the federal, state and local governments backing the project know about the cost blowout. Multiple members of Granite Belt Water Ltd have told Guardian Australia that tenders for the construction of the dam came back last year, and showed it could cost more than $200m – more than double the initial estimate. Irrigators backing the project said they no longer believed Emu Swamp would be built. They said others had already pulled out and written off their preliminary investment – in some cases up to $100,000 paid upfront. “The reality is that we won’t build the dam unless governments agree to kick in three times what they’ve already committed,” one irrigator said. “Even then, it would still be close to the most expensive water ever sold to irrigators in Australia.” Melissa Hamilton, from local group Protect Our Water, said the taxpayer funding for the dam should be “used to benefit the whole community, rather than just 50 irrigators”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “There are more than 400 farmers in the district who won’t have any access to this water,” she said. “Government modelling shows that this dam would have been empty in the last drought, and we would still have had to truck water in. Stanthorpe needs real water security, not false promises.” Hamilton said other options to drought-proof the region were less expensive, but the council had only pursued Emu Swamp. “The project hasn’t acquired the land it needs, it doesn’t have its approvals, and it doesn’t stack up financially. By now we could have completed other projects that would actually secure the long-term interests of the people of the Granite Belt.” Guardian Australia sought comment from Granite Belt Water and the Southern Downs Council. Neither organisation responded to questions.",News/Australia news,Huge cost blowout causes some farmers to withdraw support for new Queensland dam,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/huge-cost-blowout-causes-some-farmers-to-withdraw-support-for-new-queensland-dam
3/23/2022,"Ngarrindjeri man Arron Sumner Wilson has been to a lot of funerals, including his brother’s in 2017 and his mum’s in 2019. He knows how expensive they can be. So he thought he was doing the right thing by signing up to an Aboriginal community benefit fund he believed would cover his funeral costs, so his daughters were not saddled with a debt they couldn’t afford to repay. Instead, he – along with 15,000 Aboriginal policyholders and their families – will likely be left with nothing as the fund has gone into liquidation, owing millions of dollars. The collapse earlier this month of Youpla Group, which ran Wilson’s funeral fund and three others, has sparked calls for the federal government to compensate its victims. It has also raised questions over the failure of state and federal authorities to regulate it – as well as revealing an allegation, made by the liquidators in a report to creditors and filed to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), about the role of its founder, Ron Pattenden, querying whether he may have misappropriated money from the business by way of a dividend payment over a number of years. Wilson has lived on Ngarrindjeri country for most of his life. In 1999 he was working on the CDEP (Community Development Employment Projects, more commonly known as the work for the dole scheme) in Raukkan when a couple of representatives of the Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund (ACBF) came and signed up “about 20” people. Wilson paid into the fund every fortnight, even as the premium increased from $8 to $10 and then to $14 – until November 2020, when he found out that ACBF had misled him and it was not an Aboriginal community organisation and he sought advice about how to get his money back. “It’s a funeral fund we was putting into, and funerals ain’t cheap,” Wilson says. “It’d be different if it was like you’d made a fool of yourself by investing in some company that folded, you know, something silly. This was for a funeral, to make sure you get a burial. And money being left behind for other loved ones, that’s the whole idea of what I was doing it for.” In November last year, the ombudsman, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA), found that Wilson had been “misled and deceived” and the ACBF should repay his $7,034 in contributions, plus interest. AFCA found that Wilson “was, and remains, a vulnerable person. ACBF misled and deceived him. It acted unconscionably and in breach of its duty of utmost good faith”. He has not received a cent. For decades, Youpla – previously known as the Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund (ACBF) – sold funeral insurance and funeral expenses policies marketed solely to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander consumers, using marketing materials with Aboriginal art designs and attending community events like the annual Koori Knockout rugby league competition. In dozens of cases the ombudsman found that ACBF misrepresented itself as an Aboriginal-owned and controlled not-for-profit, community organisation serving the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. ACBF was found to have sold vulnerable Aboriginal people low-value funeral insurance, including cover for children and babies, with people allegedly paying more over time than the policies were worth. The royal commission into banking in 2018 heard ACBF would deduct money from Centrelink payments before people received them – which was then legal but is now illegal – and, until a policy change in 2017, deny payouts for suicide. Community and consumer groups are now calling on the federal government to compensate “the victims of this atrocious failure”. It is urgently needed, according to the Financial Rights Legal Centre’s Mob Strong debt help solicitor, Mark Holden. Policyholders who have died since the collapse of Youpla or who pass away in coming months should be able “to depart with dignity and allow sorry business to be observed respectfully,” Holden says. “First Nations policyholders have sacrificed and worked hard to put money aside for sorry business and have now been left with the risk of unimaginable intergenerational debt as a result of Youpla’s inability to follow through on its promise.” The consumer advocacy group Choice describes the collapse as one of the “worst failures of regulation it has seen” in decades. “The government allowed this disaster to unfold. It has a moral obligation to make it right,” says the chief executive of Choice, Alan Kirkland. Legal services have previously pleaded with the government to include funeral funds in a compensation scheme of last resort, which was recommended by the Hayne royal commission in 2019, but there is little chance legislation can be rushed through parliament before the federal election is called. Even so, the new laws would not have helped Youpla’s victims because the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, excluded funeral funds from the government’s proposed model. The Consumer Action Law Centre’s Aboriginal policy officer, Wurundjeri woman Samanatha Rudolph, says her organisation wrote to Frydenberg in October, trying to get Youpla included in the compensation scheme. She says Youpla had been taking money from Indigenous people for close to three decades. “There’s been plenty of opportunity for strong regulation and harsh penalties against Youpla,” she said. Frydenberg’s office referred Guardian Australia’s inquiries to Jane Hume, his assistant minister with responsibility for financial services, who did not answer when asked directly about the government’s failure to bring in a compensation scheme covering funeral funds. A spokesperson said that the government had implemented a royal commission recommendation requiring a licence to sell funeral insurance, which has stopped Youpla writing fresh policies since April 2020. “The government has also introduced design and distribution obligations that will further prevent this inappropriate selling of such policies,” the spokesperson said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The fund Wilson was in, known as Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund No 2, collapsed in November. Youpla’s directors put the rest of the group – Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund (usually known as fund No 1), ACBF Funeral Plans and Community Funeral Plans, and three other companies – into the hands of insolvency practitioners David Stimpson and Terry Rose, of SV Partners, on Friday. In a statement, Stimpson said he would “endeavour to contact all members as soon as possible with more details” and promised to issue an initial report by this Friday. The directors pulled the plug after Asic wrote to them on 11 March, questioning Youpla’s solvency. The collapse has exposed the scant regulation of funeral fund products, which had been partly overseen by NSW Fair Trading but were not regulated by Asic until two years ago. Youpla has been on the radar of both regulators for decades, first coming to Asic’s attention in 1999 and Fair Trading’s in 1992, when an investigation found it was carrying on a funeral fund business without a licence. Penalties for breaches of the NSW legislation are small: the main one is the threat of deregistration. Asic’s ability to clamp down on Youpla was also limited because until April 2020 funeral funds were exempt from the requirement to hold a financial services licence. In 2020, Asic launched federal court action accusing Youpla Group and ACBF Funeral Plans of making false and misleading statements to members. Youpla is defending Asic’s claim and the case returns to court for a case management hearing on 31 March. The collapse has also brought to light an allegation about founder Pattenden in the group’s financial situation contained in a report to creditors filed with Asic by the liquidator of Fund No 2, W Roland Robson. “My enquiries with the current directors of the company revealed that the former director of the company [Pattenden] may have misappropriated a large amount of the company’s funds by the way of the dividend payment to himself or related entities over a number of years,” the report says in a section headed “Voidable Transactions”. Where certain payments appear to a liquidator to be “voidable transactions” they may be able to take action to recover that money for creditors. One of Pattenden’s companies also provided reinsurance to the fund. Robson told creditors he wrote to Pattenden in January demanding companies associated with him repay the money, but Pattenden refused and ended reinsurance of the fund. The liquidator told Guardian Australia the withdrawal of the reinsurance was among reasons an effort by directors to refloat the fund failed. He said there was “not much” money held in Fund No 2 for its 3,400 members. “It’s basically about $100,000, that’d be it,” he said. Guardian Australia sought to contact Pattenden on his New Zealand and Australian mobile phone numbers, and at two addresses in New Zealand: a luxury penthouse complex in Gulf Harbour, an exclusive waterside development an hour north of Auckland, and a property called Tio Bay Lodge in the country’s north, which covers much of a remote headland, with its own jetty and several residential buildings. Guardian Australia has not had responses from Pattenden to questions about the liquidator’s allegations. Pattenden’s lengthy business career includes running a luxury tourism accommodation business in Vanuatu. Moored outside the Gulf Harbour address when Guardian Australia visited on Thursday was a smart motor launch used to ferry Pattenden and his crew and guests to his main boat, the 32-metre Dream Catcher, known as the biggest boat in the marina. According to friends, Pattenden has two full-time crew on the ocean-going boat, which he has used to travel between Gulf Harbour and Tio Bay Lodge. According to former associates, Pattenden recently sold land in the Bay of Islands for upwards of NZ$5m.",News/Australia news,Arron Wilson was told his funeral fund would help his family – now his money is gone,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/arron-wilson-was-told-his-funeral-fund-would-help-his-family-now-his-money-is-gone
3/23/2022,"The Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art, Australia’s longest running survey of contemporary art, has opened for 2022 – but under a shroud of sadness. The recent deaths of one of the exhibition’s key artists, Hossein Valamanesh, and the biennial’s principal sponsor, Neil Balnaves, have permeated the atmosphere: both men died suddenly in the lead-up to the 37th Adelaide festival, Valamanesh in January and Balnaves in mid-February. Their deaths have added a layer of poignancy to the 2022 event, titled Free/State, a celebratory and cerebral examination of human freedom, with curator Sebastian Goldspink drawing together the work of 25 leading Australian artists from across the country, each interpreting the concepts of state and freedom in their own ways. Developed during what Goldspink refers to as the “wild and unpredictable” environment of Covid-19 lockdowns and the Black Lives Matter protests, the biennial’s focus first came to the curator in early 2020. Sydney-based Goldspink started from a specifically Adelaidian perspective: “I was fascinated by the history of South Australia, its status as a free colony in opposition to New South Wales … and the idealistic values South Australia embraced early on, partly as a response to that status. When Covid hit, there became a real political focus on the sovereignty of individual states.” Our new normal is reflected in works such as Laith McGregor’s installation Strange Days, with more than 1,000 bottles spelling out SOS. And the hand-crafted knives of Tasmanian artist Loren Kronemyer make reference to the need for individual responsibility in a time of chaos, and survival in an apocalyptic world. The state of freedom curtailed is examined in Ukrainian-born artist Stanislava Pinchuk’s marble installation, The Wine Dark Sea, merging the text of Homer’s Odyssey with whistleblower reports from the detention centres of Nauru and Manus Island. Personal freedom and responsibility informs Sydney artist Julie Rrap’s large-scale multimedia work Write Me, which invites her audience to post social-media style comments about 26 digitally manipulated images of her face, superimposed on to a computer keyboard grid. Her interest in the collision of free speech and accountability developed during the lockdowns, Rrap says, amid public debates over personal freedom. “Covid kind of sort of shrunk my options, which turned out to be really useful,” she says. While the idea of manipulating her image on to an alphabetical keyboard had been developing over a number of years, displaying the public’s responses on a large overhead screen came more recently. “[The viewer] is commenting in a public space with other people watching, so I’m looking at notions of free speech and what people think they can say and can’t say in the debate,” Rrap says. No respectable biennial would be without an element of in-your-face grossness and Abdul-Rahman Abdullah obliges with In the Name, a series of graphically realistic animal carcasses suspended from the ceiling. Described in the catalogue as “seductive … and simultaneously repellent”, Abdullah draws on his childhood memories in Perth, watching his father slaughtering a sheep bought from a local feedlot. First Nations artists Dennis Golding and Reko Rennie also mined their childhood experiences for inspiration. Golding, a Kamilaroi/Gamilaraay artist, deconstructs the Victorian architecture of Redfern, the neighbourhood of his youth, specifically the Block. His chandelier, created from iron lace balconies salvaged from the social housing development, totally owns its prominent space. And Rennie’s video installation takes viewers on a journey through the working class western suburbs of Melbourne, where the Kamilaroi/Gamilaraay artist grew up. A lurid magenta Monaro Holden coupe moving through landscapes of refineries, abattoirs and the Westgate Bridge features in the work, titled Initiation. Rennie says he wanted to pay homage to the car’s central place in his suburb’s culture. “There’s a westie car culture – some might call it a bogan culture – where people are very proud of their vehicles and spend a lot of time working on them, and that was the way it was when I was growing up,” he says. “There was a real sense of pride in creating a cool car, and that was something I always wanted too when I was a kid – a nice-looking muscle car.” The choice of a 1970s Monaro, souped up with one of Rennie’s totem colours, was inspired by a marketing campaign of that time by General Motors Holden. The word Monaro is an Aboriginal word meaning “high plain” or “high plateau”. The juxtaposition of Indigenous culture to contemporary mainstream mundanity also feeds into Rennie’s sense of what it means to be a First Nations man born and bred in the city. “There’s a romanticised notion of Aboriginality that defines authentic as living in a desert, painting dots, dancing around, hunting and gathering food,” he says. “But the reality is that many of us grow up and live in urban environments, and mine was very much a working-class one. “It was a multicultural society of the 70s and 80s, where I never had any issues with racism because everyone else came from somewhere else. But there were run-ins with law and justice, drugs, alcohol – those were the [elements] of my initiation.” Rennie collaborated with Yorta Yorta soprano, composer and actor Deborah Cheetham for the soundtrack, a beautiful mournful work composed and performed by Cheetham with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The music has a deeply personal significance for Rennie. Like Cheetham, his grandmother was a member of the Stolen Generation. Although showing promise as a bel canto soprano, she was prevented from developing a music career by her adoptive white family, who used her as a housekeeper. “That dream was shattered,” says Rennie. “And that’s something I always remember.” 2022 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art: Free/State is part of Adelaide festival, on show at the Art Gallery of South Australia until 5 June.

3/23/2022,"Tensions between China and Taiwan have found an unlikely battleground – a fight over who rescued nine Papua New Guinean sailors who were lost at sea for nearly a month. The dispute came after the rescue of the Papua New Guinean nationals in Solomon Island waters after 29 days lost at sea, late in February. Credit for the mission was claimed by China in an article published in the Global Times, an English-language Chinese newspaper, on 26 February. The article claimed the ship’s captain called the Chinese embassy in Solomon Islands asking for help, which had been given by the Chinese government. Sun Xiao, an attaché at the Chinese embassy in Solomon Islands, told the Guardian he had taken the call from the captain of the ship, who was from mainland China. “[At] 3.30am in the early morning of 24 February, 2022, staff of the Chinese Embassy in Solomon Islands received an urgent phone call from Mr. Li Zhi, captain of a fishing boat operating in sea waters southwest of Solomon Islands. Captain Li told the Embassy that he was from Fujian province of the People’s Republic of China. He and his crew had just rescued nine survivors from a raft drifting 29 days at sea.” Sun alleged that Capt Li told embassy officials: “As a Chinese national, I appeal to the Chinese Embassy for assistance. I believe the Embassy will kindly help inform [Solomon Islands] and PNG governments to pick up those survivors and safely send them home.” He also provided the embassy with the coordinates and radio frequency of his fishing boat. “Upon receiving the phone call, the Chinese Embassy lost no time in engaging with the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & External Trade, the Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet calling on Solomon Islands government to arrange for maritime authorities to find and rescue the survivors … As Captain Li told the embassy: ‘All survivors have been taken care of by my crew, and are in good shape now. Some of my crew members come from Fujian and Shandong province of China. We Chinese people have longstanding tradition of willing to help those in trouble. They will be well treated on board my boat.’” However, Taiwan’s ministry of foreign affairs furiously disputed China’s version of the rescue, calling it a “blatant lie”. “First of all, our office would like to point out that this is a rescue attempt successfully carried out primarily due to the joint efforts of a Taiwanese fishing vessel and Taiwan’s rescue authority,” said a spokesperson. “Unlike what the Chinese Embassy in Honiara claimed, Yixiang No. 8, the fishing boat that saved the nine PNG nationals, is a registered Taiwanese fishing boat. And Taipei Rescue Coordination Center (TRCC), Taiwan’s National maritime search and rescue authority, was the authority that initially coordinated with its counterparts in both PNG and Solomon Islands in a timely manner and secured those nine lives eventually.” The spokesperson said the crew of Yixiang No. 8 spotted the sailors drifting on 25 February and reported them to the TRCC, which reached out to authorities in Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands and then carried out the rescue, eventually handing over the nine Papua New Guineans to authorities from Solomon Islands at a location near Rennell Island. “This office is not attempting to rule out the possibility that the Chinese embassy in Honiara may have stepped in at the very last stage of this operation and facilitated the repatriation of the nine PNG nationals back to their mother land. However, claiming Yixiang No. 8 as a Chinese fishing vessel and totally disregard TRCC’s efforts is a blatant lie which simply does not reflect the actual fact. Obviously, China is preaching the world of its so-called ‘One China Principle’ and taking advantages of Taiwan again.” After the Global Times article, the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) confirmed that it had Taiwan to thank for the rescue. “The [Royal Solomon Islands Police Vessel] Gizo operation carried out after request received from Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) Honiara that a Taiwanese fishing vessel Yi SIANG No. 8 found a ray-boat with a 40 horse powered engine with nine survivors on the boat,” said RSIPF director of police maritime, Supt Nevol Soko. According to Soko, the survivors – six men and three women – were then kept on board the vessel for two nights while waiting for the patrol boat to transport them to Solomon Islands’ capital of Honiara. They were checked by a doctor and found to be healthy, despite their long time at sea, and tested negative for Covid. “They were so fortunate to be rescued after drifting for 29 days,” he said. Pacific nations have been the site of contestation between Taiwan and China in recent years. A number of the few countries in the world that recognise Taiwan diplomatically are in the Pacific, though several of these, including Solomon Islands, have switched allegiance from Taiwan to China in recent years. The switch from Taipei to Beijing has been particularly vexed in Solomon Islands, with the country divided between supporters of the two. The diplomatic switch was seen as a flashpoint for violent protests and rioting in the capital of Honiara in November last year, which saw buildings, including much of Chinatown, burnt down and three people killed.",News/World news,‘A blatant lie’: China and Taiwan fight for credit over rescue of sailors lost at sea for 29 days,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/a-blatant-lie-china-and-taiwan-fight-for-credit-over-rescue-of-sailors-lost-at-sea-for-29-days
3/23/2022,"Victoria’s human rights watchdog was flooded with inquiries about the state government’s powers during Covid, with the agency reporting a surge in queries and complaints. The Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission is currently working through a backlog of complaints, with a 17% increase recorded this financial year – on top of a 1,445% spike in queries about the powers of the state government in 2020-21, compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, queries about the right to protest and the powers of Victoria police jumped by 181% in 2020-21. The commission’s education and engagement director, Lauren Matthews, said inquiries about the powers of the Victorian government were “extremely rare” prior to the pandemic, with the low baseline contributing to the large jump. “We received a very large volume of inquiries from people questioning whether the Victorian government actually had the power to impose restrictions, limit movement, and mandate vaccines or the wearing of masks,” Matthews said. “Many of the people who contacted us were highly emotional, concerned about overreach by government and believing that their rights and protections under Victorian law were being breached.” For the three years to June 2019, the commission averaged just over 8,387 inquiries a year – about 700 inquiries a month. But in seven months, from July to February, the agency had received 6,065 inquiries – with more than one-third related to Covid. During the same period, the agency received 654 complaints – with more than 80% regarding Covid and mask mandates. In 2020-21, there was a 42% increase in complaints and a 43% increase in inquiries, with most of the spike fuelled by Covid-related complaints. Matthews said the agency was still in the process of working through the backlog of complaints that arose during Covid, despite inquiries easing since December as Covid restrictions were relaxed. “We have also experienced a much more stressed public, particularly during Covid and lockdowns, and that has translated to some people displaying much more challenging behaviour, and that has made it more challenging for our staff to manage,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The introduction of the vaccine mandate in October and the passing of Covid-related pandemic legislation coincided with a spike in inquiries. The introduction of a mask mandate in August also correlated with a jump in complaint numbers. The majority of Covid-related complaints were about allegations of disability discrimination. This included people with a disability being denied access to a shop for not wearing a mask despite having a lawful medical exemption from wearing one. The commission also received a large volume of complaints regarding allegations of Covid-related workplace discrimination.

3/23/2022,"From 18 March to 10 April, live music event Great Southern Nights will bring hundreds of gigs to venues across New South Wales. An assortment of Australian artists are set to perform, with shows taking place everywhere from Sydney’s Oxford Street to regional hubs like Gosford and Goulburn. One of the acts is Sarah Blasko, who will play Sydney’s State Theatre on 24 March. Since the early aughts, Blasko has been one of Australia’s most respected musicians, having now released six albums that straddle the line between indie rock and art pop. During the release period for her 2007 record, What The Sea Wants, The Sea Will Have , the Sydney-born musician visited New York – staying on the apartment floor of another Australian star, Sia. That trip turned out to be somewhat disastrous, but it was also where Blasko picked up her most cherished object – a 1960s guitar. Here, she tells us about the visit that led to her beloved instrument, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. I have an old 1960s Martin guitar that means a lot to me. I bought it during an ill-fated one-month stay in NYC for the release of my second album. Sia, who I’d never actually met until then, offered for me and my guitarist friend Ben to stay with her and her flatmates in her loft apartment in Soho. I felt bad paying her nothing to stay at her place, having only ever chatted on email, so she came up with the idea that I should buy a bed for the room as payment – she wanted to make it feel like a kid’s room. She sent me a photo of a secondhand, 80s pine bunk bed but, wanting to impress her, I decided to purchase a brand new steel one instead. To make a very long story short, the bed didn’t turn up until very late into the stay and it was completely broken – as though it’d been run over by a semi-trailer. I spent the rest of the time trying to get the company to take it back and refund my money. We slept on couch cushions – eventually having to pay the doorman to dispose of the bed piece by piece as though it were a dead body – and finally handed Sia some cash. She found a pine 80s bunk on eBay within about an hour of the financial exchange. Anyway, many annoying and ridiculous things happened during that time, but let’s just say the album didn’t exactly make a splash and the bloody bunk bed caused some real problems! NYC lost some of its shine, but I still have the story and I still have that cute, old guitar. I don’t want to brag, but I have an amazing garlic crusher. You can pop the garlic in whole and unpeeled and it does everything for you – then it has a very handy black bar that pushes the garlic off the crusher into the receptacle. It’s not even electrical, it’s manual! Look, you might have something equally or indeed more impressive, but let me just say that growing up as I did, and then living in share houses, I didn’t even know that a garlic crusher of this calibre existed. We’ve also got a tomato knife that I’m very fond of, but I won’t go into that this time… My mum had a beautiful antique gold cross that she left to me when she died, and it was stolen when someone broke into my apartment a couple of years later. It was heartbreaking. They obviously just wanted cash and small items and could never have known the sentimental value of the jewellery, but it was something that just can’t be replaced. I looked in plenty of Cash Converters but I sadly never found it.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Three things with Sarah Blasko: ‘I felt bad paying Sia nothing to stay at her place’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/23/three-things-with-sarah-blasko-i-felt-bad-paying-sia-nothing-to-stay-at-her-place
3/23/2022,"HBO’s current series Winning Time is a heavily stylised look at the Los Angeles Lakers franchise throughout the 1980s, in particular its decades-long rivalry with the Boston Celtics. The pilot directed by Adam McKay (Moneyball, Don’t Look Up) harnesses a style heavily indebted to Tarantino, with crashing graphics, regular breaches of the fourth wall, and quite a lot of extraneous information dumping. It’s also hugely entertaining, well-cast and beautifully shot – but largely sidesteps the actual tensions and dramas of the era in favour of nailing period wardrobe and hairstyles. Which is not to say you shouldn’t watch Winning Time; it’s just a little lacking in historical context and meaty basketball content. Luckily, ESPN’s brilliant 30 for 30 documentary series covered the same story in Celtics/Lakers: Best Of Enemies, an exhaustive three-part, five-hour documentary released in 2017. In the 1980s, basketball went from a marginal interest to an absolute phenomenon. The reasons for the game’s ascent are varied and complicated – including increased television interest, endorsement deals with McDonald’s and Nike and the expansion of the league to more markets – but one major draw was the rivalry between the LA Lakers and Boston Celtics, and in particular, between Lakers point guard Magic Johnson and Celtics forward Larry Bird. Like all great rivalries, it’s the differences between enemies that allow for the closest matchups. Magic was Hollywood personified; with his thousand-watt smile and razzle-dazzle style of play, he brought showmanship to the NBA. Lakers games were a form of theatre, and sold-out arenas filled with the likes of Farrah Fawcett, Rob Lowe and Jack Nicholson sitting courtside. Celebrities started attending Lakers games at the LA Forum just to be seen; the narrator (and a Celtics fan), Donnie Wahlberg, dismissively calls the Forum “the arena that doubles as a nightclub.” Lakers games quickly became the centre of Hollywood glamour and Magic was the ringleader, standing 6ft 9in high, and appearing much larger.Boston, on the other hand, was pumping with Irish blood and its team took a workingman’s approach to basketball. Their players were violent and tough. They had no time for theatrics. Bird, born and raised in the tiny farming town of French Lick, Indiana, was fiercely adverse to the growing celebrity he was receiving; you’ll feel his visceral discomfort as you see him shoot a splashy Converse ad. He was an ungraceful athlete with superhuman basketball abilities and a sharp tongue. The only concession to his own physical health was cutting down on beer during one off season late into his career, and buying an exercise bike for his farm – a new leaf that Boston commentators marvelled at. His career was cut short due to a back injury caused by dry paving his mother’s driveway: he was a famous multimillionaire at the time, but it needed to be done, and Larry got things done.A more perfect set of rivals couldn’t have been carved out in a television writers’ room. The pair became the two faces of the NBA and an easy shorthand for the racial tensions that inflamed the US in the 1980s. The first part of Celtics/Lakers: Best Of Enemies casts back through the 1960s and 70s to cover not only the Boston and LA rivalry, but the overriding perception among white Americans that the NBA was a “black league”, replete with the loaded references to “playground hoops” verses “fundamental basketball”, which coloured most coverage at the time. While Winning Time has a lot of fun with the muttonchop, cocaine, pool-side excess of 1980s LA, all played for voyeuristic joy, Best of Enemies shows a country in freefall. Crack cocaine is ravaging the inner cities, Boston’s big draft hope Len Bias dies of an overdose, racial disharmony spills into racist violence and the sexually promiscuous Magic Johnson contracts HIV – at the time considered a quick, painful death sentence.If you want a real look at the era, with its complicated societal issues, this is a wonderful documentary series.

3/23/2022,"Joanna Wilson, a Melbourne cafe owner, dreads opening a letter from one of her suppliers, knowing it likely will include a warning of yet another price increase. Her business has already had to deal with a 25% jump in milk prices and 60% rise for some vegetables over the past year. “My coffee alone has gone up by $6,500 a year. It’s everything though, bread, vegetables, milk,” she says during a recent post-lunch lull in trading in the suburb of Brunswick. Whether it’s cafes or food producers, from FourN’ Twenty pies to suppliers of fresh fruit or baked beans, businesses across the country were already dealing with Covid disruptions. And then Russia invaded Ukraine, ensnaring two major food exporting nations in conflict, and cloaking Moscow in sanctions. It’s a pressing dilemma for firms like Wilson’s John Gorilla cafe just emerging from the Omicron wave of the pandemic: how much of the higher costs can they pass on to customers without crippling their businesses? “There are people who say ‘I’m more than happy to pay those prices to keep you open’, but then there are other people who’ll leave a Google review complaining it’s outrageous,” she says. “I feel like I can’t put my prices up.” Wilson estimates costs for raw ingredients alone have climbed $20,000 in the past year, with more to come. For example, her customer favourite, avocado piquillo – a dish of poached eggs on sourdough toast with avocado, sweet chilli pickle, piquillo pepper, rocket and feta – now costs almost 25% more to make. Economist Saul Eslake said it’s likely many businesses that are raising their prices have a genuine need to, noting the growing list of those intending to do so in the future. SPC, a fruit and vegetable processor based in Victoria’s Goulburn Valley, has flagged their prices will rise by 10 to 20%, a move necessary to stay viable, it has said. Jesse Feldy, owner of the New Order cafe in Melbourne’s inner south suburb of Prahran, said it’s inevitable some of his prices will be hiked. A majority of his suppliers have warned him in writing in the past few weeks that the prices are on the way up. “It affects our bottom line at the end of the day,” Feldy said. “We’re here as a small business to make money. I love hospitality, but it’s also not a hobby. It’s something I need to support my family.” Eslake says the rising prices underscore the problem of slow wage growth. It will increase pressures on policymakers to ease pressure on low-income earners who typically fork out a bigger proportion of their cash on food than higher-paid ones. “The cost of that should be imposed on those in the top half of income distribution or businesses who are the winners from high energy and food prices – like grain growers, and coal and LNG producers,” he said. In 2021, inflation in Australia reached 3.5% compared with a 2.3% rise in wages. Official inflation data for the first quarter of 2022 won’t land until late April. In the meantime, surveys are showing a drop in consumer confidence. Eslake said it remains unclear how the market disruptions, particularly from the war in Europe, will pan out: “We don’t know the extent to which further price pressures induced by the conflict in Ukraine will be sustained.” “If there’s a peace deal, the oil price could drop,” he said. “But there could still be an impact on food prices because Ukraine is one of the largest wheat exporters, and they may not have a crop this year so prices would then remain elevated for the next year.” With Ukraine accounting for 12% of global wheat trade, according to Rabobank, the price of wheat has soared to all-time records. Sanctions on Russia, another major grain exporter, could last beyond the fighting, should a peace agreement be hammered out. “We also don’t know what will happen with the Covid-19 outbreak in China and how that might impact global supply chains,” Eslake said. Rod Sims, the outgoing chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, said there was little scope for the market watchdog to intervene. “What’s going on at the moment is so clearly due to international events,” he said. “There’s really not much we or anybody can do about this.” The ACCC had been seeking changes to merger laws to do more to curb market concentration and to secure the addition of an unfair practices provision that would make it easier to pursue those trying to take advantage of people affected by the east coast floods. The regulator’s main power is to call out such behaviour to discourage price gouging. However, “we haven’t seen any evidence” of such behaviour, Sims said, adding if people do see proof of such action, “they should absolutely report it”. As Feldy mulls which of his menu items will be more costly for customers, he’s wary of making his cafe uncompetitive. “Who is going to budge first?” he said. “It’s not just us, prices are going up everywhere. People will come in and complain about the price of petrol,” he said. “It could soon also be the price of coffee and the price of booze.” “I wouldn’t want to be the one that jumps first because I know what’s going to happen,” Feldy said. “People will be frowning and saying ‘that’s a pretty expensive cup of coffee’.” ",News/Business,"‘My coffee has gone up $6,500 a year’: Australian businesses emerging from Covid crisis struggling with food price hikes",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/23/my-coffee-has-gone-up-6500-a-year-australian-businesses-emerging-from-covid-crisis-struggling-with-food-price-hikes
3/23/2022,"The climate crisis is the greatest threat to the future and security of Australians and the country is unprepared for its increasingly harsh impacts, a group of defence leaders has warned. In a statement, to be published in a full-page advertisement in The Australian newspaper on Wednesday, senior retired defence and security personnel have called on political leaders to make the security risks posed by climate change a central issue of the forthcoming federal election. “As ex-service members and experienced security practitioners who have witnessed up-close the devastation of war and crisis, we consider that climate change now represents the greatest threat to the future and security of Australians,” the letter says. “The first duty of government is the safety and protection of the people, but Australia has failed when it comes to climate change threats. Australia currently has no credible climate policy, leaving our nation unprepared for increasingly harsh impacts. “We call upon all those offering themselves as political leaders in this election year to make climate change a primary focus and commit to mobilising the resources necessary to address this clear and present danger.” The statement has been issued by the Australian Security Leaders Climate Group (ASLCG) and signed by 17 senior former defence and security personnel including former defence force chief Admiral Chris Barrie and former deputy chief of the Royal Australian Air Force Air Vice-Marshal John Blackburn. Its publication comes a week after Barrie told a conference defence personnel are not allowed to speak out on the national strategic threats posed by climate change without prior approval from the defence minister Peter Dutton’s office. Dutton’s office rejected those remarks as incorrect. Barrie said climate change had previously contributed to concurrent wheat crop failures in Ukraine, Russia, China and Australia, which led to rising food prices in countries around the world and became a key trigger for the Arab Spring and regional instability. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Now high energy and food prices triggered by the Ukraine invasion could contribute to social unrest in countries as far apart as Egypt and Indonesia, which is right on Australia’s doorstep,” he said. Barrie said climate change would only make these occurrences more frequent and, without urgent action by political leaders, “we can expect to see increasing instability, conflict and forced migration from neighbouring nations and within our region”. The letter states that global heating imperils the health, well-being and livelihoods of Australia’s people and that hotter and more extreme weather, floods, fires and cyclones are threatening water, transport, food and other critical infrastructure systems, disrupting supply chains and undermining our Australia’s resilience.
