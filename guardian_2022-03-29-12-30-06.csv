3/29/2022,"Iraq’s arrest and imprisonment of Australian engineer Robert Pether was contrary to international law, constituted “enforced disappearance”, and may have involved forms of torture, a United Nations body has found. Pether and colleague Khalid Radwan were detained in Baghdad in early April last year after they returned to Iraq to resolve a business dispute between the government and their employer, CME Consulting, which was working on the new headquarters for the Central Bank of Iraq. Both have since been sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay a USD$12m fine over allegations that his firm spent money that should have gone to an architect and a subcontractor. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, in a report released overnight, deemed their arrest to be arbitrary detention, demanding their immediate release. It has also referred the case to the special rapporteur on torture. The report said it had received allegations that “[Pether] was exposed to extreme cold, threats of death, humiliation and various forms of psychological abuse.” According to the complaint, “Mr Pether was detained in a [2x2 metre] cell with the lights permanently on,” the working group said in its report. “He was reportedly blindfolded, interrogated, screamed at, threatened, insulted and shown torture rooms.” “In the first 12 days of detention, Mr Pether lost 15kgs and became severely dehydrated. He was barred from any contact with the outside world for the first 19 days of his detention and was permitted to go outside for only two hours,” the complaint said. The report also said that Pether was reluctant to talk about his experiences in jail due to fear of reprisal. The report found reports of “abusive and coercive interrogations” to be credible. It also found credible allegations that Pether had been forced to sign a statement in Arabic, which he did not understand. Iraqi authorities also likely obtained evidence from him improperly and after ill-treatment and torture, the report says. “The Working Group expresses its gravest concern at the allegations of torture and ill-treatment, which constitute a prima facie breach of the absolute prohibition of torture, which is a peremptory norm of international law.” The UN received no response from the Iraqi government to the allegations, something it said was regrettable. The report found the pair were given no reason for their arrest at the time of their detention. For the next three days, no one knew their whereabouts or situation. Enforced disappearance of this kind was a “particularly aggravated form of arbitrary detention”, the report said. “Pether and Radwan were held in a situation of de facto enforced disappearance,” the report said. “Such deprivation of liberty, entailing a refusal to disclose the fate or whereabouts of the persons concerned or to acknowledge their detention, lacks any valid legal basis under any circumstance.” Their trial was also found to be compromised. The report said it viewed with concern allegations that Pether’s evidence was mistranslated to indicate guilt and said that even during the trial “Pether and Radwan did not have clarity around their charges”, with charges being dropped during the hearing and replaced with others.

Pether and Radwan is arbitrary.” In a statement, Desree Pether, Robert’s wife, said the report was a “total vindication” of the position of both her husband and Radwan, which they had held from the outset. “We just want Iraq to now do the right thing,” she said. Pether’s lawyer, Peter Griffin, said his team have already reached out to the Iraqi government to urge for the pair’s release. “This is a very powerful decision,” she said. “The UN have found in no uncertain terms that Robert and Khalid’s arrest was unlawful and arbitrary.” The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, has previously said she has raised the case with the Iraqi government. “We have sought clarity about, as I’ve said, the nature of the complaints that have resulted in Mr Pether’s detention,” she told Perth radio last year. “And if it is indeed a civil matter, a contractual matter, then we would seek for it to be treated in that way.”",News/Australia news,"‘Enforced disappearance’: Iraq’s jailing of Australian Robert Perther is arbitrary detention, UN finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/enforced-disappearance-iraqs-jailing-of-australian-robert-perther-is-arbitrary-detention-un-finds
3/29/2022,"Mick Fanning is to make another return to professional surfing four years after announcing his retirement from the sport with the three-times world champion awarded a wildcard for the upcoming Rip Curl Pro Bells Beach event – the Australian’s favourite stop on the WSL tour. Fanning, 40, called time on his career in 2018 after 17 years on the tour, saying he had lost the drive to compete “day in, day out”. He made a brief return to the pro tour at last season’s Rip Curl Narrabeen Classic and will again get back in the water for the event in Victoria – the longest-running surfing event in the world – from 10 to 20 April. “Bells is the wildcard I really wanted,” Fanning said. “Obviously, I did Narrabeen last year but Bells is the one I was really aiming for. It’s a place that is really close to my heart, and if I was ever going to take a wildcard, it would be there, so I’m pretty fired up.” During his career, Fanning won at Bells Beach four times, putting him on level pegging with surf greats Kelly Slater and Mark Richards. No man has won more than that trio, although Gail Couper rang the bell 10 times across the women’s amateur and professional eras in the 1960s and 70s. Stephanie Gilmore and Lisa Andersen have also won four titles at the iconic break. “Personally, I really like the wave at Bells,” Fanning said. “The speed of it, the wide open canvas, and the fact that it is a right hand point break. I love everything that comes with Bells, the history, the cliffs, the gathering of everyone down in the car park. It’s so awesome. It’s something that sits in my heart.” Fanning was knocked out by the Brazilian Italo Ferreira in the round of 32 the last time he made a return to the tour in Narrabeen, but ahead of Bells – where he missed out on a fairytale ending to his career in April in 2018 – he says he has what it takes to compete with the next generation of surfers. “During my career I got close [to winning a fifth], but right now I just want to focus on putting on a good performance,” Fanning said. “My preparation when I was on tour was non-stop training but this time around I’ve just been focusing on my surfing and making sure it’s up to the level of the best in the world.” During his career, Fanning claimed 22 tour wins, 11 top-five finishes and three world titles. He now has a chance to add a 23rd title after being granted one of five wild-card entries for Bells. He joins compatriot Mikey Wright, who will return to the tour for the first time since announcing an indefinite break from surfing following last year’s Corona Open Mexico as an injury replacement for Liam O’Brien. World No 6 Caio Ibelli, Barron Mamiya and Matthew McGillivray complete the wild card lineup in the men’s competition, with Gabriel Medina, Yago Dora and Carlos Munoz out injured. In the women’s competition, Bronte Macaulay will replace Caroline Marks, who has withdrawn due to medical reasons. Earlier this month, Fanning and fellow surfing champion, Joel Parkinson, made headlines after helping NSW communities impacted by the floods by ferrying stranded residents and distributing supplies to people badly affected at Tumbulgum on the north coast.",Sport/Sport,Mick Fanning to make dream World Surf League comeback at Bells Beach ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/29/mick-fanning-to-make-dream-world-surf-league-comeback-at-bells-beach
