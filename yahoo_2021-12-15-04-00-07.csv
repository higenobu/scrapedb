The human remains are believed to be Pomaski's and were found in Texas, the local sheriff said. Human remains have been found in Texas in the search for 29-year-old Taylor Pomaski, who went missing in April. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said on Twitter that the remains were confirmed to be human by the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. ""At this time, investigators are unclear on the identity of the remains, but investigators believe them to be related to the Pomaski case,"" he said. ""Identification of the remains will be carried out by the HC Institute of Forensic Sciences."" Pomaski, the girlfriend of former NFL player Kevin Ware, was last seen leaving a party in Harris County on April 25, the sheriff previously said. Ware, who played two seasons as a tight end in the NFL in 2003 and 2004, was named a suspect in a murder investigation in connection to Pomaski's case in June, according to a Montgomery County prosecutor's court flings seen by Click2Houston. The football player was arrested on June 11 after he failed to appear in court in connection to a separate drugs and weapons charges case, Click2Houston reported at the time. Since then, Ware has been held in jail without bond, according to court filings seen by NBC News. He has not been charged in connection to Pomaski's disappearance. Ware's attorney, Coby DuBose, did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

And while Liz isn't a ""gym person"" per se, she stays fit by keeping busy all day. And that includes gardening and logging‚Äîyes, real logging! Elizabeth Hurley has an important health update to share: She just got her COVID-19 booster shot. And, from the looks of it, she‚Äôs pretty stoked about the whole thing. The 56-year-old model and actress shared the good news in an Instagram post, writing, ‚ÄúYeeeessssss! Covid booster today. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù In the pic, Liz is wearing a gorgeous leopard-print string bikini that shows off her impressively toned abs. While plenty of people cheered her on in the comments, others couldn‚Äôt get past the pic. ‚ÄúThis woman just does not age üòç,‚Äù one wrote. ‚Äúüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè,‚Äù another said.

My wife and I are both first-line health care professionals who have been in the trenches since the beginning. This disease is far uglier than most people realize,"" said a frontliner. OK, but how does Elizabeth get those next-level abs? She‚Äôs not really a gym-goer, per se, but she practically invented found fitness. (Found fitness, in case you‚Äôre not familiar with it, is basically finding ways to be active during your day.) ""I don't really do any set exercise, per se, because I prefer to get my exercise from doing something than being in the gym,"" she previously told Women‚Äôs Health. That means a lot of different things to Liz‚Äîincluding doing squats while she brushes her teeth and going for 20-minute walks with her dogs to get her HR up. Liz is even into logging (yes, logging), dropping this little nugget during an interview with Extra: ""I do a lot of exercise, but it‚Äôs really the gardening‚Ä¶ cutting down a hedge, using my chainsaw to cut down a tree, logging, all of that stuff I do.‚Äù Fascinating‚Äîand impressive!

She shared this little video on Instagram last year of herself doing weighted arm lifts on her patio while wearing a bikini:    A post shared by Elizabeth Hurley (@elizabethhurley1) Of course, Liz eats well too. She told The Cut that she likes to have homegrown foods and tries to focus on eating organic as much as possible. ‚ÄúAll through summer we eat fruit and vegetables from my own garden. I used to have a small organic farm, and all the meat my son ate was from the farm,"" she said. ""Obviously that‚Äôs not possible for most people, but supporting local farmers wherever you live is a good thing."" Naturally, hydration is also crucial for her.

12/15/2021,"US District Court Judge Alison Nathan is presiding over Ghislaine Maxwell's child-sex-trafficking trial. Nathan was first appointed as a judge by then-President Barack Obama in 2011. Before that, her legal career spanned private practice, academia, and a stint in the Obama White House. Over several hours last week, an accuser named Carolyn testified that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused her on more than 100 occasions, beginning when she was 14 years old, and that Ghislaine Maxwell set up her meetings with the financier and participated in some of the abuse. Maxwell's attorneys grilled Carolyn over every tiny detail of her testimony, drawing out perceived discrepancies in her story. The prosecutors tried to slow down the barrage, shouting ""Objection!"" to several of the questions. Maxwell's attorneys had also objected to some of the prosecutors' questioning, trying to limit the scope of what Carolyn ‚Äî who testified using only her first name ‚Äî could tell jurors. After court ended that day, US District Judge Alison J. Nathan admonished both sides. ""This has gotten a little out of hand,"" Nathan said, adding: ""No more communicating to the witnesses or the jury via objections. Understood?"" Jurors will look at the evidence and ultimately decide whether Maxwell is found guilty of sex-trafficking, but Nathan is the referee, deciding what evidence they're allowed to look at. And it's clear that she has no patience for drama. Maxwell's trial is the most high-profile case Nathan has presided over to date. So far, she's been evenhanded and restrained on the bench. Prosecutors have accused Maxwell of sex-trafficking girls with Epstein, sexually abusing them herself, and lying about her actions in a deposition. She's pleaded not guilty to all charges. As Nathan presides over the trial, she is also preparing for a confirmation vote. President Joe Biden recently selected her for a promotion to the US Court Appeals for the Second Circuit ‚Äî just one step away from the Supreme Court. If confirmed, Nathan would be the second openly LGBTQ woman to serve on any federal circuit court, after Second Circuit Judge Beth Robinson, who was also nominated by Biden and confirmed to her position in November. Nathan and her partner, law professor Meg Satterthwaite, have twin sons, according to The Advocate. Nathan first became a judge in 2011, when then-President Barack Obama nominated her to serve in the Southern District of New York. At the time of her nomination, Nathan was working as special counsel to the solicitor general of New York, a job she was appointed to by then-New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. Nathan's nomination was largely unopposed until conservative groups staged last-minute challenges, The Advocate reported at the time. The groups charged that Nathan didn't have the American Bar Association rating to be a judge. An ABA panel gave Nathan mostly ""qualified"" as opposed to ""well qualified"" ratings, with a minority saying she was ""unqualified,"" according to Gay City News. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, who put Nathan forward for the job, defended her. Schumer said Nathan's lower rating had more to do with her young age, the outlets reported, and pointed out that it hadn't been a problem when 33 of President George W. Bush's judicial nominees with identical ratings were confirmed. Sources told The Advocate that Concerned Women for America's Legislative Action Committee also sent a letter to senators, saying Nathan's ""political activism"" called into question ""her impartiality and judicial temperament."" They took issue with Nathan's serving on an LGBTQ issues policy committee on the Obama campaign, and for working pro bono for clients who tried to challenge the military's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy for gay servicemembers. Additionally, Nathan has written extensively on the death penalty and lethal injection methods, some of which she wrote in 2008 could be ""needlessly cruel."" Despite the 11th hour challenge, Nathan was ultimately confirmed by a narrow 48-44 vote. Leading up to her nomination to the federal judiciary, Nathan's career had progressed from private practice, to academia, and then government work. After graduating from Cornell Law School in 2000, she spent two years in prestigious clerkships, including for former Associate Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. From there, she entered private practice at the elite law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr ‚Äî the corporate home of the likes of Robert Mueller and former US Senator Ken Salazar ‚Äî where she specialized in ""complex federal litigation and constitutional law,"" according to the questionnaire she filled out when she was nominated to be a judge in 2011. It was while on a four-month leave from WilmerHale in 2004 that Nathan got some of her first political work, serving as a volunteer legal advisor for John Kerry's failed presidential bid. In 2006, Nathan entered academia, teaching for two years at Fordham University School of Law, and then another year at New York University School of Law. After she served as a volunteer voter protection advisor on the Obama campaign in 2008, Obama appointed Nathan to serve as his special assistant and an associate White House counsel, where she worked for a year before returning to New York with her family to join the Solicitor General's office in 2010. Since becoming a judge, Nathan has presided over some other highly publicized cases, including shutting down Harvey Weinstein's attempts to get an emergency appeal in 2019, according to the Associated Press. Weinstein's lawyers made the motion in connection to a civil lawsuit filed by a woman who said Weinstein sexually assaulted her after encouraging her to meet him in Cannes, France, so he could watch her demo reel. Weinstein's lawyers argued that a previous judge in the case, who later died, made a mistake in categorizing the incident as sex trafficking, and said the case should immediately move to appeal in the Second Circuit Court. But Nathan sided with the former judge, saying his ruling was ""careful and convincing."" The accuser's case could move forward, she ruled, while Weinstein had to submit to a slower appeals process. Prior to the Maxwell trial, perhaps Nathan's most high-profile case involved billionaire Elon Musk. In 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission started investigating allegations that Musk misled investors by tweeting about a potential buyout of his company. Musk settled the case for $20 million and agreed to have his statements overseen by Tesla lawyers. Just four months later, the SEC accused Musk of violating the agreement when he tweeted about how many cars Tesla planned to produce in 2019. Nathan ordered Musk to meet with the SEC for at least an hour to resolve the issue, after which the two parties came up with a new agreement that specified which financial milestones and other events Musk couldn't tweet about. At the time, Musk said he had ""great respect for Judge Nathan.""

12/15/2021,"Toyota revealed more than a dozen new electric vehicles it plans to build, including a pickup truck. This is the first time we're seeing what Toyota's upcoming e-truck may look like. It's part of Toyota's $70 billion investment into green vehicles and technology. We've known for months that Toyota is planning to unleash an electric pickup truck sometime soon. On Tuesday, the company revealed how it'll look. During an event laying out its new global push into electric vehicles, Toyota took the wraps off of more than a dozen future SUVs, sedans, and sports cars. Tucked way in the back corner was one of the most exciting prospects of them all: the yet-to-be-named truck. Here it is: Toyota hasn't released any details about the pickup, like when it'll arrive, how much it'll cost, or how big it'll be. It would make sense to launch an electric version of the Tundra to compete with upcoming battery-powered full-size trucks like the Ford F-150 Lightning and Chevrolet Silverado EV. But this pickup looks more Tacoma-sized. That could be a smart move, too, since the gas-powered Tacoma crushes all other midsize pickups in the US, while the Tundra isn't nearly as popular as its rivals out of Detroit. Right now, the only electric pickup you can buy is the midsize R1T, the inaugural truck from California startup Rivian. Toyota launched the pioneering Prius hybrid more than 20 years ago, but has been a bit slow to embrace fully-electric vehicles, arguing that hybrids are the best way of reducing global emissions. It came out swinging on Tuesday, though, unveiling 15 electric models and plans to roll out 30 by 2030. Toyota said it would plunge $70 billion into electrification efforts and make Lexus an electric-only brand. The company revealed lots of similar-looking electric SUVs of various sizes, but also a few more interesting models. It previewed an electric off-road SUV tentatively named the Compact Cruiser EV. It looks like the spiritual successor to Toyota's FJ Cruiser. And it showed off sleek, low-slung sports cars from both the Lexus and Toyota brands. Details are scant for now, but we'll surely learn more about all these models as they near production.

12/15/2021,"MAYFIELD, Ky. ‚Äî As a catastrophic tornado approached this city Friday, employees of a candle factory ‚Äî which would later be destroyed ‚Äî heard the warning sirens and wanted to leave the building. But at least five workers said supervisors warned employees that they would be fired if they left their shifts early. For hours, as word of the coming storm spread, as many as 15 workers beseeched managers to let them take shelter at their own homes, only to have their requests rebuffed, the workers said. Fearing for their safety, some left during their shifts regardless of the repercussions. At least eight people died in the Mayfield Consumer Products factory, which makes scented candles. The facility was leveled, and all that is left is rubble. Photos and videos of its widespread mangled remains have become symbols of the enormous destructive power of Friday‚Äôs tornado system. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that 74 people were confirmed dead in the state. McKayla Emery, 21, said in an interview from her hospital bed that workers first asked to leave shortly after tornado sirens sounded outside the factory around 5:30 p.m. Employees congregated in bathrooms and inside hallways, but the real tornado wouldn‚Äôt arrive for several more hours. After employees decided that the immediate danger had passed, several began asking to go home, the workers said. ‚ÄúPeople had questioned if they could leave or go home,‚Äù said Emery, who preferred to stay at work and make extra money. Overtime pay was available, but it wasn‚Äôt clear whether those who stayed were offered additional pay. Supervisors and team leaders told employees that leaving would probably jeopardize their jobs, the employees said. ‚ÄúIf you leave, you‚Äôre more than likely to be fired,‚Äù Emery said she overheard managers tell four workers standing near her who wanted to leave. ‚ÄúI heard that with my own ears.‚Äù About 15 people asked to go home during the night shift shortly after the first emergency alarm sounded outside the facility, said another employee, Haley Conder, 29. There was a three- to four-hour window between the first and second emergency alarms when workers should have been allowed to go home, she said. Initially, Conder said, team leaders told her they wouldn‚Äôt let workers leave because of safety precautions, so they kept everyone in the hallways and the bathrooms. Once they mistakenly thought the tornado was no longer a danger, they sent everyone back to work, employees said. Anyone who wanted to leave should have been allowed to, Conder said. Elijah Johnson, 20, was working in the back of the building when several employees wanting to head home walked in to speak with supervisors. He joined in on the request. ‚ÄúI asked to leave and they told me I‚Äôd be fired,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúEven with the weather like this, you‚Äôre still going to fire me?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù a manager responded, Johnson told NBC News. Johnson said managers went so far as to take a roll call in hopes of finding out who had left work. Company officials denied the allegations. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolutely untrue,‚Äù said Bob Ferguson, a spokesman for Mayfield Consumer Products. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a policy in place since Covid began. Employees can leave any time they want to leave and they can come back the next day.‚Äù He also denied that managers told employees that leaving their shifts meant risking their jobs. Ferguson said managers and team leaders undergo a series of emergency drills that follow guidelines of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. ‚ÄúThose protocols are in place and were followed,‚Äù he said. A 24-hour hotline is available as of Monday for employees to call about hazard pay, grief counseling and other assistance, he said. Autumn Kirks, a team lead at the factory who was working that night, denied Monday afternoon on MSNBC that people‚Äôs jobs were threatened if they didn‚Äôt go in. But another employee, Latavia Halliburton, said she witnessed workers‚Äô being threatened with termination if they left. ‚ÄúSome people asked if they could leave,‚Äù but managers told them they would be fired if they did, she said. The first tornado warning passed without any damage, but several hours later, another warning was issued. Once the second tornado siren sounded sometime after 9 p.m. Friday, Conder and a group of others approached three managers asking to go home. ‚Äú‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt leave. You can‚Äôt leave. You have to stay here,‚Äô‚Äù Conder said the managers told her. ‚ÄúThe situation was bad. Everyone was uncomfortable.‚Äù Mark Saxton, 37, a forklift operator, said that he would have preferred to leave but that he wasn‚Äôt given the option. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing. We should have been able to leave,‚Äù Saxton said. ‚ÄúThe first warning came, and they just had us go in the hallway. After the warning, they had us go back to work. They never offered us to go home.‚Äù As the storm moved forward after the second siren, the employees took shelter. The lights in the building started to flicker. Moments later, Emery, who was standing near the candle wax and fragrance room, was struck in the head by a piece of concrete. ‚ÄúI kid you not, I heard a loud noise and the next thing I know, I was stuck under a cement wall,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt move anything. I couldn‚Äôt push anything. I was stuck.‚Äù Emery, who was trapped for six hours, had several chemical burn marks on her legs, her buttocks and her forehead from the candle wax. She also sustained kidney damage, her urine is black, and she still can‚Äôt move her legs because of the swelling and from having been motionless for so long. Employees who wanted to go home early said they were mistreated. ‚ÄúIt hurts, ‚Äôcause I feel like we were neglected,‚Äù Saxton said.",U.S./NBC News,"Factory bosses to workers before tornado: 'If you leave, you're more than likely to be fired'",https://news.yahoo.com/factory-bosses-workers-tornado-leave-214937404.html
12/15/2021,"LOS ANGELES (AP) ‚Äî Rain drenched Southern California on Tuesday as a powerful storm slid down the drought-stricken state, snarling traffic as vehicles spun out and raising the threat of mudslides in areas scarred by wildfires. Nearly 7 inches (18 centimeters) of rain fell before dawn in one area of Santa Barbara County, northwest of Los Angeles, the National Weather Service said. Residents of communities near the Alisal Fire burn scar in Santa Barbara County were ordered Monday to evacuate over concerns that heavy rains might cause flooding and debris flows that could inundate hillside homes. A similar order was issued for people living in several communities near another burn scar in the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles. A submerged vehicle was found wedged against a bridge pillar in the surging Los Angeles River but water was moving too violently for firefighters to determine whether anyone was inside. The vehicle was spotted in the river before dawn. Snow continued falling in the mountains of Northern California after it started coming down last weekend. Avalanche warnings were in effect in the Mono and Inyo county areas of the eastern Sierra Nevada. Motorists spun out on whitened mountain passes and people outside wielded umbrellas that flopped in the face of fierce winds. Near Lake Tahoe, the Kirkwood Mountain Resort ski area was closed Monday, saying on social media that it was not safe to open with 17 inches (43 centimeters) of overnight snow and high winds. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just so bad and so thick,‚Äù said California Highway Patrol Officer Carlos Perez. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre telling people that if they don‚Äôt need to be around this area, they probably shouldn‚Äôt travel.‚Äù The multiday storm, a powerful atmospheric river weather system that was sucking up moisture from the Pacific Ocean, was expected to dump more than 8 feet (2.4 meters) of snow on the highest peaks in California and Nevada. The storm brought much-needed moisture to the broader region that‚Äôs been gripped by drought that scientists have said is caused by climate change. The latest U.S. drought monitor shows parts of Montana, Oregon, California, Nevada and Utah are classified as being in exceptional drought, which is the worst category. Most western U.S. reservoirs that deliver water to states, cities, tribes, farmers and utilities rely on melted snow in the springtime. The soaking also brought relief from the threat of wildfires, which is significant into the late fall in Southern California. The welcome rain didn‚Äôt stop Oakland resident and artist Zhenne Wood from walking her neighbor‚Äôs dog, a short-legged corgi. ‚ÄúI decided to stay home today and not go anywhere, which is nice,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm really happy for the rain. I think we needed it a lot.‚Äù The storm prompted officials to shut down a 40-mile (64-kilometer) stretch of the iconic Highway 1 in California‚Äôs Big Sur area until Tuesday. The scenic coastal route south of the San Francisco Bay Area, frequently experiences damage during wet weather. A second storm predicted to hit California midweek shortly after the current storm moves on could deliver almost continuous snow in mountainous areas, said Edan Weishahn of the weather service in Reno, which monitors an area straddling the Nevada state line. ___ Har reported from San Francisco.

12/15/2021,"KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's parliament approved on Tuesday a draft law that allows foreign troops to take part in military exercises on the territory of the former Soviet republic in 2022, a move likely to infuriate Russia. According to the draft law, submitted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine plans to hold 10 large military exercises next year. Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, has stepped up military cooperation with Western countries amid an increase in hostile activity by Russia and its proxies that has raised the risk of open war between the two neighbours. Kyiv accuses Moscow of deploying some 90,000 troops along their long shared border. Moscow says its moves are purely defensive and that it has the right to move forces around its own territory as it sees fit. Ukraine's deputy defence minister Anatoliy Petrenko told parliament before the vote that 21,000 Ukrainians and 11,500 military personnel from the United States, Britain, Poland, Romania and other countries would participate in exercises on land, at sea and in the air. ""Conducting multinational exercises on the territory will help to strengthen national defence capabilities and support political and diplomatic efforts to maintain stability in the region,"" said Petrenko. There was no immediate response on Tuesday from Russia to the Ukrainian parliament's approval of the draft law.
