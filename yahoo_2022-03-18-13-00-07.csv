3/18/2022,"By Marco Aquino and Carlos Valdez LIMA (Reuters) - Paleontologists have unearthed the skull of a ferocious marine predator, an ancient ancestor of modern-day whales, which once lived in a prehistoric ocean that covered part of what is now Peru, scientists announced on Thursday. The roughly 36-million-year-old well-preserved skull was dug up intact last year from the bone-dry rocks of Peru's southern Ocucaje desert, with rows of long, pointy teeth, Rodolfo Salas, chief of paleontology at Peru's National University of San Marcos, told reporters at a news conference. Scientists think the ancient mammal was a basilosaurus, part of the aquatic cetacean family, whose contemporary descendents include whales, dolphins and porpoises. Basilosaurus means ""king lizard,"" although the animal was not a reptile, though its long body might have moved like a giant snake. The one-time top predator likely measured some 12 meters (39 feet) long, or about the height of a four-story building. ""It was a marine monster,"" said Salas, adding the skull, which has already been put on display at the university's museum, may belong to a new species of basilosaurus. ""When it was searching for its food, it surely did a lot of damage,"" added Salas. Scientists believe the first cetaceans evolved from mammals that lived on land some 55 million years ago, about 10 million years after an asteroid struck just off what is now Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, wiping out most life on Earth, including the dinosaurs. Salas explained that when the ancient basilosaurus died, its skull likely sunk to the bottom of the sea floor, where it was quickly buried and preserved. ""Back during this age, the conditions for fossilization were very good in Ocucaje,"" he said.

3/18/2022,"The 2021 CrossFit Games champ Justin Medeiros said sleep and recovery are crucial for his training. He keeps a careful nighttime routine and aims for at least eight hours of sleep to perform well. He also uses a sauna and cold plunge for muscle recovery in his home gym. CrossFit's Justin Medeiros says ice baths, sleep, and sauna sessions help him perform at his peak. Medeiros, who was named the Fittest Man on Earth as the winner of the 2021 CrossFit Games, said now that he's graduated from university, he'll be going ""full-time CrossFit,"" devoting more time than ever to his training and ramping up his self-care routine in the process. ""What's really changed this year is the amount of time I'll be able to spend on recovery,"" he told Insider in an interview coordinated through his partnership with leading sleep fitness company Eight Sleep. The 23-year-old star athlete said he typically works out for five hours on training days, and will ramp up to even longer sessions as competition season nears. As a result, sleeping enough and helping his muscles recover with sauna and ice bath sessions is helping bring his fitness to the next level. ""There's so many people that go into the gym and bust their butts training super hard but I think there's a lot of room to move that needle outside the gym,"" Medeiros said. As an elite athlete, Medeiros said he spends a lot of time and energy keeping his body in peak shape, from dialing in nutrition and eating 5,000 calories a day, to working on mobility for demanding exercises like handstand walks. But the most noticeable factor in his routine is sleep. ""If I don't have a good night of sleep, that whole day of training is messed up,"" he said. Medeiros said his performance and energy is best when he's getting at least eight hours a night, and more on rest days, when he'll turn off his alarm and sleep in. To prioritize a good night's rest, he takes CBD oil before bed, spends about 20 minutes winding down with mobility exercises, and turns off all electronics before bedtime at 10 pm. ""It's a struggle for me to get myself to go to bed so I've found having my nightly routine is really helpful,"" he said. He said Eight Sleep has been a ""game changer,"" with temperature control tech for a comfortable rest and sleep tracking to help him stay on target. Medeiros said he's set up his home gym to be ""the ultimate training compound"" so he doesn't need to leave home to use a sauna and cold plunge daily. A typical routine will include 15 minutes in the sauna, followed by two to three minutes in the cold plunge, repeated for a few cycles. Research suggests both sauna and ice baths can speed muscle recovery, reduce soreness, promote relaxation, and even help boost endurance.
