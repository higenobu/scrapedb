4/16/2022,"GOLDEN VALLEY, Ariz. (AP) — An Arizona man faces animal cruelty charges after 183 dead dogs, rabbits, birds and other animals were found in a freezer, including some that were apparently frozen while alive, officials said. Mohave County deputies and animal control officers found the animals in a garage freezer April 3 after a woman reported that Michael Patrick Turland, 43, hadn’t returned snakes she’d lent him for breeding, the Sheriff’s Office said Thursday in a statement. The freezer was at a home that Turland previously rented in Golden Valley, a rural community in far western Arizona. The frozen animals included dogs, turtles, lizards, birds, snakes, mice, rats and rabbits, the statement said. “Several of the animals appeared to have been frozen alive due to their body positioning."" The Sheriff's Office said they were kept in a “large-sized chest freezer.” The home's owner reportedly discovered the frozen animals while cleaning after Turland and his wife vacated the property. The owner then contacted the woman who notified the Sheriff's Office, the statement said. Turland was arrested at the home Wednesday when deputies were told he had returned to the property, the office said. “When interviewed, Turland eventually admitted to placing some of the animals in the freezer when they were still alive,"" the statement said. Court records didn't list an attorney who could comment on behalf of Turland, who was arrested on 94 counts of animal cruelty.",U.S./Associated Press,"Cops: Arizona man stuffed 183 animals in freezer, some alive",https://news.yahoo.com/arizona-man-arrested-183-dead-180756884.html
4/16/2022,"North Korea's Mount Kumgang – Diamond Mountain – tourist resort once symbolized hope for peace. Satellite images show that buildings at the resort were destroyed last weekend, per The Times. Many of the destroyed buildings were South Korea-owned. North Korea has used explosives to demolish a golf resort that was built for South Koreans and once symbolized hope for peace and cooperation between the two countries, according to The Times. Satellite images show that buildings in the Mount Kumgang - Diamond Mountain – tourist resort, built by South Korean companies, were partially destroyed last weekend, The Times reported. This follows reports that the floating Haegumgang Hotel in Mount Kumgang, which South Korean's Hyundai Group owned, was dismantled last month, per local media. South Korean government officials attempted to use an intergovernmental hotline to demand an explanation for the destruction of tourist businesses in the mountainous region, per The Times. They were unsuccessful in their efforts to get a response. ""North Korea's unilateral act of dismantling the hotel clearly goes against the purpose of joint inter-Korean efforts based on mutual respect and consultations,"" Cha Deok-cheol, a spokesman for South Korea's unification ministry, told The Times. Mount Kumgang Tourist Region, a special administrative region of North Korea, was established in 2002 to welcome South Korean vacationers. It was a hallmark of South Korea's ""Sunshine Policy"" of engagement with North Korea — a foreign policy framework that attempted to bolster cooperation between the two nations via economic interaction. South Koreans frequented the resort for several years, contributing foreign currency to the North Korean economy. However, tourism stopped in 2008 when a tourist was shot dead by a North Korean soldier. A 53-year-old South Korean woman was killed after walking into an off-limits area, resulting in the South Korean government suspending tours to the resort. The suspension lasted until 2018. In 2019, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited and criticized the tourist region, describing it as ""backward,"" ""hotchpotch,"" and ""shabby,"" per Australia's ABC News. The media outlet reported that he called for facilities to be rebuilt to meet North Korea's ""aesthetic taste,"" the media outlet reported.
