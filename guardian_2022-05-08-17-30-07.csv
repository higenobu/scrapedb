5/8/2022,"Tom Felton wants to make it clear that he is embracing his inner meltdown. It’s almost the first thing he says, after sitting down opposite me at a Canary Wharf restaurant holding a small block of Cathedral City Cheddar in his hand. We’re meeting for a brief 45 minute lunch, as the 34-year-old actor – most recognisable for playing Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter franchise – is midway through intense rehearsals for his West End debut in 2:22: A Ghost Story. It’s a haunting comedy starting its third consecutive London season to much critical acclaim. Two weeks of rehearsals down, in just seven days they’ll move from the rehearsal room on to the stage at the Criterion Theatre. Felton is feeling confident, even if this afternoon he’s a little overwhelmed. “There are a lot of words to learn,” Felton says, speaking fast. “It’s a 140-page script and it all flows so effortlessly, so one little hiccup throws the whole thing off.” He’s wearing a blue baseball cap, white trousers rolled up to his calves, and a green and yellow sweater: dressed to be comfortable. “There are just four people on the stage for the whole hour-and-a-half,” he says, a slight sense of panic, “so you can’t drop the ball even for a moment.” On film sets, where he’s far more experienced, Felton explains, you’re encouraged to approach each take slightly differently. “Right now I’m battling with my brain,” he says, “as in this we need everything to be precisely the same again and again, eight shows a week, for 17 weeks… Mate, this is doing no favours for my anxiety.” James Buckley, of Inbetweeners fame, was one of the show’s last stars. “He is a friend,” Felton says, “and told me it would be a challenge unlike any before: physically, mentally, that I need to embrace the meltdown that’ll come, which is what I’m doing. It’s new to me, but thankfully the rest of the cast and directors know what’s happening. And I’m excited, even if there are a lot of nerves.” That’s why this morning he arrived at rehearsals early to run lines alone, stopping off at Tesco for snacks to keep him going. He hasn’t done theatre since childhood, but remembers that time fondly. Unwittingly, he says, he’s also found himself eating like a kid. That explains, I think, the little block of cheese now perched on the table. He orders a plate of homemade chicken fingers when a waiter appears. It has been almost 30 years since Felton’s last theatre performance. Back then, he was as a six-year-old treading the boards for a kids’ production at the Epsom Playhouse, not far from his childhood home. “It was usually tree number three,” Felton says, “that sort of thing.” He is the youngest of four brothers, and it was the eldest who was the real theatre kid. Felton was only really at drama club to tag along. He recalls being a snowman, or was it a Bugsy Malone extra? “I really wasn’t noticed for my acting prowess particularly early,” he says, “I was far more interested in being a fisherman.” His dad was a civil engineer, often travelling, so it was his mum looking after the children. And she worked multiple jobs to ensure the boys could pursue their adolescent passions, however short-lived. “A few months before acting,” Felton says, “I was desperate to be a violinist. She worked nights stacking shelves, days doing all sorts, to make sure we were always told yes.” Four boys were a handful – the police were involved in at least one brother’s teenage rebellion. When Felton was six, he got his first acting job. He’d need chaperoning? No bother: Mum took it in her stride. “That first job was for a Commercial Union advert,” Felton says, “filmed over two weeks across America. Mum just changed everything in her life to make sure I could do it.” Soon after came The Borrowers, filmed for four months at Shepperton Studios. His next film was Anna and the King, a remake of The King and I starring Jodie Foster. Four months in Malaysia, his mum always by his side. A year after its release, Harry Potter auditions came up. Unlike most who attended the open call – his future young co-stars included – auditions and studios were nothing new to this relatively seasoned 12-year-old. “I was also one of the only ones who had no idea what Harry Potter was at the time,” Felton says. “Anyone could try out for it, so many excited kids went along who loved the books deeply.” For Felton, it was just another job. They tried him out for Harry Potter and his best friend, Ron Weasley, at first, dying his hair black then ginger in the process. Felton was a little bemused. In the end he was cast as Draco Malfoy: for those unfamiliar with the series, the bad kid… ish. “I reckon I got the part because I was nonchalant,” Felton says, “and had no idea what anyone was on about. Wizards in cupboards under the stairs? And with three older brothers, you learn to be confident quickly. I think Chris Columbus, the director, recognised this slight disinterest and arrogance in me, which he thought could work for Malfoy.” Far from becoming an off-the-rails, overnight child-star, Felton found that the early films hardly fazed him. “My schedules were fixed in a way I could stay at school with weeks on and weeks off,” Felton says. “Rupert [Grint], Emma [Watson] and Daniel [Radcliffe], meanwhile, were there non-stop for 10 years. I carried on as normal. I’d get the occasional gag or comment from my mates, but honestly nobody was bothered.” His main frustration came from missing Halloween parties and school trips when he had to be on set. “Some people really struggle with the idea that I wasn’t this special, popular kid,” Felton says, “but I was walking around with dyed hair and played an evil wizard. It wasn’t cool. It did me no favours with the girls.” Felton found adjusting to the trappings of success was also fairly straightforward, helped by the fact it didn’t come overnight. “It happened somewhat slower than you might imagine,” Felton explains, “and it’s not like I was particularly sensible: I bought cars for my brothers, a house for my mum, skateboards and video games for me.” It was also never a given that Felton would be cast in all eight blockbusters with their no doubt increasingly lucrative contracts. “We were going to make two initially,” he says. “If after the second, the kids still looked young enough, maybe we’d do a third. Then a fourth. It went on like that. We never signed up for 12 years. At some point I just assumed they’d replace us with decent actors, but they never did.” Throughout the filming period, Felton never let himself consider the idea he might actually make a go of an adult career in the industry. He’d been a child actor, sure, but standing on the Potter set, watching the likes of Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson and Michael Gambon, it was hard not to feel a little out of place. “I didn’t have to do 10 pages of dialogue to audition,” Felton says. “All I did was turn up as a snotty kid who looked right and I got the part.” It was Jason Isaacs, who played Felton’s villainous on-screen father, who offered Felton off-screen kindness and sage guidance. “He was incredibly supportive and graceful,” Felton recalls, smiling. “It was a massively important relationship to me. He never talked to me like a kid, and showed me the way.” Occasionally, Felton still refers to Isaacs as dad. “Jason was a driving force in getting rid of my impostor syndrome,” Felton continues, “I thought all I did was stand around and look miserable for a long time.” Bagging his part as a child meant Felton believed he’d just had a lucky break. “He told me to snap out of it,” Felton says, “That I was good, but could be much better. To go and work on it.” While filming the sixth film in the franchise, Felton was 20. It was then that he finally listened to Isaacs’s advice. “He told me to get into shape, learn to do an American accent and to get a good US agent.” Felton did as instructed. Almost immediately after hanging up his Hogwarts robes for the final time, Felton was on set in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Not long after, he moved to Los Angeles. Work kept coming, slow but steady: lots of independent films and a smattering of television gigs, nothing quite on Planet of the Apes’ or Potter’s scale. “I took things slower,” he says, “although not necessarily out of choice. If Planet of the Apes Two had come along I’d have taken it right away, but I was and am content.” Each Potter film took six months or more to make; indy films often take six weeks from start to finish. “So I enjoyed California life,” he says, “surfing, writing music, hanging out with my dog. That sort of schedule lets me have more of a balance in my life.” Was it hard, I ask, not to compare his to the trajectory of the other Harry Potter kids? “I never really had that,” he says, “I’ve always been their biggest cheerleader. I remember seeing Daniel on Broadway for the first time, there was a Draco-esque moment: fucking hell, he’s just so good. I wasn’t comparing myself, but it kicked me into gear.” It’s been more than 10 years since the last Harry Potter film was released, but their popularity shows no signs of abating. For anyone connected with the franchise, life on set – and the experience of being part of its huge, unparalleled success – remains a constant topic of fascination to an ever-growing fandom around the globe. I’d expected Felton to find talk of the wizarding world rather frustrating, certainly tedious. He started making them while a fresh-faced child and he’s now in his mid-30s; the auditions were well over 20 years ago. I assumed he’d quite like to move on now, thanks very much. Felton, however, seems thrilled to discuss it. He’s at his most animated when talking Potter, bringing it up repeatedly of his own accord. No doubt he’s also grateful to be distracted from the stress of rehearsals. “I feel very lucky,” he says, “and I do love talking about it, even when I should probably be plugging other projects.” If anything, Felton says he’s still adjusting to its success now. “Daniel, Rupert and Emma were on the posters,” he continues, “they were taken out of school and went on press tours. I had a far more normal life.” Through all the years of filming, Felton says he was rarely, if ever, stopped on the street. It’s only more recently he’s found there’s a greater interest in Felton: the man who played Draco Malfoy. “I walked around for 10 years with bright blond hair, and never once was stopped on the tube,” he says, “but now it’s changing. Fans who come up to me these days weren’t even born when the first film was made. It has grown, passed on from generation to generation.” He’s beginning to realise it’ll never go away. Eighteen months ago, Felton returned to the UK permanently. He realised, after so many years away, his five-year-old-niece was suddenly 12. He missed his friends and family, and life in London. While he was a child actor, going from audition to audition, his mum would take him to Lillywhites sports shop at Piccadilly Circus as a treat, to stare at all the cricket bats. “When I first got cast in this play,” he says, “I had no idea where the theatre was.” Turns out it’s next to Lillywhites. “My whole career is thanks to right place, right time, great mum,” he says. “The fact it’s there feels special. She’s already bought tickets for the first four shows even though I did tell her I could get her in for free. This play is for her.” Recently, Felton returned to Los Angeles for a holiday, and ended up taking a trip to California’s Harry Potter theme park. “I was just indulging myself,” he says, “and my mates had never been.” Felton saw a young girl having the time of her life, tears of joy and everything. “At the end I couldn’t help but go up to her, take off my hat, and tell her I’d see her in the Slytherin Common Room. Seeing her face light up? I’ll never get bored of how happy it makes people.” And with that Felton is off. He asks to take a picture together, and then darts back to the rehearsal room. When a waitress comes over to collect his untouched plate of chicken fingers, she asks me, grinning: “Sorry, but was that Draco Malfoy?” 2.22 A Ghost Story is at The Criterion Theatre, London, until 4 September (222aghoststory.com)",Arts/Stage,‘I turned up as a snotty kid who looked right’: Tom Felton’s life after Harry Potter,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/08/i-turned-up-as-a-snotty-kid-who-looked-right-tom-feltons-life-after-harry-potter
5/8/2022,"Every Sharon Van Etten album drills deep into the grit of struggle and its pearl: resolve. Long a dissector of toxic relationships, this sixth outing finds her happily relocated from Brooklyn to LA, where Van Etten and her young family hadn’t unpacked before they had to see out a pandemic. Her usual scrying of messy innards now comes with an added dimension – that of trying to hold everything together as the world outside upended. So while 2019’s Remind Me Tomorrow pivoted around songs of plucky resilience such as Comeback Kid, … All Wrong offers up a different kind of constancy in Come Back, in which a couple fight to keep their defining intimacy in the face of having to be grownups. Written pre-Covid and sweetened with birdsong, the elegant piano-and-vocal track Darkish reminds depressives that storms end and dawns break. The album’s uplifting bop is Mistakes, an ode to getting things not all that wrong. Throughout, however, a central issue remains with Van Etten’s music. All these highs and lows pass in an unvarying, mid-paced indie-rock fug, with little to hold the attention outside her gossamer delivery of candour and insight.",Arts/Music,Sharon Van Etten: We’ve Been Going About This All Wrong review – mid-paced candour,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/08/sharon-van-etten-weve-been-going-about-this-all-wrong-review
5/8/2022,"They say that the Ukrainian war is returning us to the 1930s. So here is a flash from that past. Behold, gorgeous in full-fig diplomatic uniform with his cocked hat under his arm, the British ambassador to Berlin as he mounts the steps to the foreign ministry in the Wilhelmstrasse. He is carrying a document, Britain’s ultimatum. Confirm Germany’s cessation of hostilities against Poland before 11am or a state of war will exist between us. But it’s only nine in the morning. Nobody much is about. So Sir Nevile Henderson stands on a carpet in the hall by himself and slowly reads the ultimatum aloud. Then he leaves. It’s 3 September 1939. Does Vladimir Putin’s aggression really mean that we must relive those times, when the League of Nations fumbled with endless European crises over minorities and plebiscites and frontiers and land-grabbing invasions? True, states today don’t bother with declarations of war. Hitler and Stalin showed Putin how to dispense with that rubbish and replace it with rubbish proclamations dripping with lies, hypocritical victimology and fake history. But some of those old riddles survive to plague us. One is the difference – if there is one – between “independence” and “territorial integrity”. Liz Truss, as foreign secretary, is among the most hawkish politicians over Ukraine. In her “war aims”, supporting its independence means not only helping to beat away the Russians but restoring Ukraine’s “integrity” – the pre-2014 frontiers that included Crimea and the whole Donbas region. But that’s a dangerous muddle, conflating two things that aren’t the same. (How could the Foreign Office have let her say it?) It also takes us back to that ambassador with his cocked hat. Six months earlier, in March 1939, the prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, had staggered the world (and himself) by reversing his “appeasement” policy; he issued a “guarantee” to Poland that Britain would go to war if Nazi Germany violated Polish independence. Six months later, Hitler did attack Poland. The Nazis seized Danzig, the Wehrmacht tanks poured over the border, the Luftwaffe bombed Warsaw. Britain’s guarantee was triggered. Or was it? As his “peace for our time” hopes collapsed around him, Chamberlain made a last, futile suggestion: Poland’s “independence” was not threatened by the Nazi invasion, only its “territorial integrity” (Hitler was claiming the Danzig region). So perhaps the war didn’t have to happen. This thought earned only contempt. With Hitler, violation of territory and independence came to the same thing. Ukraine, outside Nato, has no “guarantee” of anything. There are three ways this war could end: Russia driven back to the pre-2014 line; Ukraine defeated and partitioned; or (the most likely at present) a stalemate along a fragile ceasefire line. That would leave Russia occupying some territory claimed by Ukraine while peace negotiations dragged on. International arbiters will be tempted to push some obvious compromise: Russia keeps Crimea, while Donbas is partitioned under UN auspices. Too neat to work? First, peacemakers have to answer one brutal question: is Putin Hitler? In other words, will any compromise – leaving him with some conquests – simply encourage plans for further conquests? Remember Munich, in 1938. The Sudeten Germans had a pretty good case, in self-determination terms, for leaving Czechoslovakia and joining Germany. But, as events proved, that case should have been outweighed by the recognition that Hitler was an aggressive monster out to swallow all Europe. Much the same could be said about Crimea. Its population mostly feels Russian and regarded the peninsula’s attachment to Ukraine as, at best, a Soviet-era mistake. But to accept Crimea’s clumsy seizure by Russia as legitimate only encourages Putin’s ambition to annex other fragments of the old Soviet dominion. The trouble is that Truss’s “maximalist” war aims assume independence and territorial integrity are indivisible. They are not. Take Poland. The nation was stripped of many ancient cities and a third of its territory in 1945. But, once free of Soviet imperial overlordship, its independence is intact. The Trianon treaty in 1920 reduced Hungary to less than a third of its prewar size, but left a ferociously independent “core” Hungary. Georgia (like Ukraine, an informal Nato candidate) still insists Abkhazia is integral to its sovereignty, although that tiny Black Sea nation rejected absorption into Georgia in 1993. But no one would dare say that in “losing” Abkhazia Georgia lost its independence. At tomorrow’s Victory Day parade in Moscow, Putin may claim “mission almost accomplished”. That depends on how narrowly he can define “mission”. But peace talks, if and when they begin, will inevitably centre on where new frontiers will run, which means, unfairly, finding out how much lost territory Ukraine will give up. Here danger lurks. Ukrainian politics since independence in 1991 have been unforgiving, to put it mildly. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s brave and selfless war leadership has been a break with the corrupt oligarchs and demagogues who have mostly hogged the Kyiv stage. But if Zelenskiy takes responsibility for ending the war on a bargain that included, say, accepting that Crimea stays with Russia, some ambitious figures would be tempted to stab him in the back as a betrayer of Ukrainian independence. They could fill the streets with hyper-nationalist mobs and Zelenskiy’s creation – a new degree of national unity – would dissolve in chaos. Hope lies with the younger generations now fighting for their country. Their world view is west of centre: a European Ukraine that is liberal- or social-democratic, a nation where the rule of law and transparency are more than slogans. Some of them are from the west of the country, their identities secure in their Ukrainian language and culture. But the men and women who really matter are the millions who speak Russian, who regard themselves as ethnically Russian but who now, through contempt for Putin’s regime and blazing outrage at this invasion of what is their homeland, have come to feel fully Ukrainian. Their country is in ruins, but it is their country now.

5/8/2022,"Iwas feeling quite calm about seeing this show by the self-described “38-year-old crip” Dan Daw until I got the email warning me that it was “about kink and power play”. Then as I walked into the venue, I was told that if I found anything triggering, I could walk out and be taken to a calm space. By the time I took my seat, I had no idea what to expect. By the time I left it 90 minutes later, I still didn’t quite know what I had seen. But I hadn’t been alarmed or upset – the overriding emotion I had witnessed was tenderness. Certainly, Daw’s show – nominated for the 2021 National Dance awards – is unlike anything else you are likely to see. The Australian dancer, playing himself, invites the non-disabled dancer Christopher Owen, playing KrisX and “here so those of you who are like KrisX can see yourselves represented on stage”, to perform a series of consensual semi-sexual acts. These range from Daw being treated as a footstool to being encased in a latex box in which the air is vacuumed out. Throughout, his commentary, at once wry and impassioned, emphasises the fact that this domination is what he needs and wants. Its argument is that society fucks the disabled; now, in showing how he wants to be loved, Daw is exercising his power. The dance that develops is intense and fascinating, characterised by moments of interdependence as Daw lies backwards across Owen, asking him to support his limbs, or to whirl him around like a human wheelbarrow. It’s full of gestures of care. At the close, when Daw’s protective tattoo of a Japanese oni seems to come to life, surrounding his body with shining silk and plastic limbs, you witness a man who is absolutely assured of his right to be who he is and want what he wants. It’s not an easy show, but it is an uplifting one.",Arts/Stage,"The Dan Daw Show: review – consent, kink and pushing comfort zones",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/08/the-dan-daw-show-review-consent-kink-and-pushing-comfort-zones
5/8/2022,"As a boy I believed so implicitly in the Loch Ness monster that I made my dad drive us all the way from Southampton to Scotland to see it. The night before, in a dream, I saw its shape snaking through the marshes at the lake’s edge. I was terrified. The next day the great grey waters remained unbroken by a serpentine neck, but that did nothing to dispel my belief. I filled an empty bottle with Loch Ness water, took it home to put in the cupboard under the stairs, and waited for tiny plesiosaurs to hatch out. Humankind cannot bear very much reality, as TS Eliot said, so we reinvent the monsters already there in our heads. This week sees the screening of the TV series based on Sarah Perry’s novel, The Essex Serpent, a Victorian resurrection of the legend of a chimeric, watery beast said to emerge from the marshes in search of human prey. Perry’s story draws on the idea that something strange might exist in the space between us and the infinite – the “thin places” of Celtic myth. In fact, our notions of residual monsters may have much to do with the way Celtic people were driven to the edges of the British Isles, to bays, lochs and islands, which seemed to retain such beliefs as gestures of defiance. In the 1940s a BBC radio producer, David Thomson, went to Scotland and Ireland in search of selkies, myths of shape-shifting seal people. He treated them not as tall tales, but as cultural artefacts, believing that the stories he recorded were “the last vestiges of pagan belief, before the onset of the nuclear world”. In 1937 a remarkable survey of schools in Ireland had sought to catalogue such folklore. It was an uncanny version of Mass Observation, an assertion of a new republican state. “Is there a story told in your district of a serpent or large animal which lives in a certain lake or river there?” children were asked. “Are water-horses or water-bulls spoken of? Are stories told of strange animals met by night on roads?” One boy said that water-horses emerged from Drumcor Lough at night to feed, then returned to the lough and turned into animals like eels. “Customs and beliefs in a conservative country like ours,” the survey concluded, “come from the Bronze Age as well as from the early Christian period.” Little wonder that the first reports of a monster in Loch Ness came from the Irish missionary St Columba, who ordered the beast to desist from attacking a swimmer in 564 AD. In the 1930s, reports of Nessie poured in, spurred on by an increase in tourism and access to the loch’s shores, but also by the Great Depression in which escapism was a reaction to social and economic distress. Even Virginia Woolf was compelled to record a visit to the loch in 1938 when she met a charming couple “who were in touch with the Monster. They had seen him. He is like several broken telegraph posts and swims at immense speed. He has no head. He is constantly seen.” He still is. Last week a couple staying in Scotland posted a video said to show a 5m-long creature with a fin swimming in the loch. That story came as a kind of antidote to terrible news of the war in Ukraine. In the 1970s sea monsters, yetis and aliens also appeared in a threatened world, whose wildernesses were rapidly shrinking and whose human lives were being overtaken by technology. In the great extinction, we were left only with the dragons of our unconscious, as Carl Jung said. Perry’s novel has its counterpart in Iris Murdoch’s The Sea, The Sea of 1978, in which a theatre director retires to a rocky shore where he witnesses, in the broad light of day, a sea serpent emerging malevolently from the waves. “I could see the sky through its coils,” he says, horrified. Murdoch, born in Dublin, had a fascination for the uncanny and a malignancy in nature, a sensibility evident in the folk horror films of the time; a psychosexual terror expressed in the juxstaposition of flowerprint crinolines and cryptozoological creatures. The Victorians had an obsession with sea serpents; it was the dark side to their moral certainty. The characters in The Essex Serpent declare the coming of the beast to be a punishment for their sins, or a symptom of their times, while the main character, Cora Seaborne, believes it to be a surviving dinosaur. Darwin’s theories had thrown up such uncertainties; and while the poet Matthew Arnold wrote of the “melancholy, long, withdrawing roar” of the sea of faith, newspapers carried serious sea monster reports from around the empire. Most celebrated of all was the creature seen in the South Atlantic in 1848 by the crew of HMS Daedalus. “An enormous serpent, with head and shoulders kept four feet constantly above the surface of the sea” seen in the presence of officers of Her Majesty’s Royal Navy gave the beast a delicious credibility. In our own troubled times the sea retains its power to contain the unknown. Jung saw the sea as the repository of our collective unconscious; Jean-Paul Sartre thought its thin green film was designed to deceive people. Scientists estimate we have still identified only a third of the species in the deep ocean. Whales and basking sharks swimming just beneath the surface can look like many-humped beasts, and the Daedalus monster is now believed to have been a sei whale, an almost eelish mammal, albeit 20m long. And in a nod to Freudian phallic symbolism, other sea serpent sightings have been attributed to whales rolling on their backs and extruding their prodigious penises. But I decline to yield entirely to such earthy rationality. A respected whale scientist once told me his colleague had seen a large unidentified serpentine animal at sea, almost the length of the ship he was on. So long as those reports keep coming in, I’ll keep the faith. That bottle is still under our stairs.

5/8/2022,"The government is scrambling to rehouse hundreds of Ukrainians granted visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme because the people they were supposed to stay with have been deemed “unsuitable”, the Observer can reveal. Refugee charities have warned since the scheme’s launch that with most of the refugees being women and children, and many matches made on social media websites such as Facebook, the scheme risked being targeted by predatory men. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC), which runs the scheme, has insisted that no visa is issued until the Home Office has completed checks on every adult in a sponsor household. However, a source with links to the DLUHC told the Observer that the department is “looking for bridging accommodation for a group of 600 refugees who have come to the UK, but the people they have come to stay with have been found to be unsuitable”. This included sponsors with a criminal record. The refugees have been placed in hotels as an emergency option, the source said, but ministers are looking for better options, including university student accommodation, until they are matched with new families. A second source, who also spoke to the Observer on condition of anonymity, said: “These 600 Ukrainian refugees had been granted visas, but their sponsors were found to be unsuitable either because they had a criminal record or for some other reason.” Robina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing, a charity that set up the UK’s first refugee hosting programme and is matching 1,000 Ukrainians with families across the UK, said it was no surprise that the government’s scheme had “unravelled so quickly”. “It’s a free-for-all matching system,” she said. “We don’t agree with social media as a tool for meeting vulnerable people like this.” Qureshi is concerned that a predatory single man who is only interested in hosting a young, single Ukrainian woman would not be caught out by DBS checks. She said: “Refugees have been led along by people saying they are registered for Homes for Ukraine, which sounds like some official guarantee when that isn’t the case.” Yvonne Kachikoti, head of resettlement and integration services at charity Refugee Action, said: “The government’s reckless and unregulated approach to matching has put vulnerable refugees at considerable risk of ending up in the homes of people planning to exploit them.” She added: “Already traumatised families forced to leave their Homes for Ukraine host after a nasty experience are unlikely to want to be rematched with another sponsor.” The Local Government Association says it has been flagging up the “inevitability” of some unsuitable accommodation being offered since the start of the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Its chair, councillor James Jamieson, said: “We are asking the government to give us information on sponsors prior to matching, so we can get ahead of the game in making checks.” He said councils had been getting more advance information in the past 10 days, but it was “still far short of what we would like”. He stressed that the Home Office was responsible for checking if hosts have criminal records before a visa is granted. He added: “There is no check on accommodation before that, no local police check, and no local knowledge applied to people.” A government spokesperson said: “Homes for Ukraine has stringent safeguarding measures, and they are working. All potential sponsors and adults living in the household are subject to security checks, including criminal records, before visas are approved to allow applicants to travel to the UK. Councils also conduct further checks on the sponsor and their household as quickly as possible once a visa application has been submitted. “Local authorities will provide emergency accommodation to Ukrainians if necessary. This has not been required for the overwhelming majority of the 19,500 people who have arrived under the scheme so far.” As yet there is no system in place for universities to sponsor Ukrainian refugees. However, Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ group, said 20 universities have expressed interest. Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester University, said: “We registered our accommodation on the Homes for Ukraine website in March. Sadly, we have no refugees with us, which is so frustrating. We remain extremely keen to do this and rooms could be made available immediately.” He said with many of the refugees being women and children, it was important they could offer 24-7 security, including police community support officers embedded at the university, as well as cooking and social facilities. He added: “We want to make every contribution, however small, to help those who have been made into refugees by this cruel, illegal invasion, as well as to those who are bravely remaining to fight.”",News/UK news,Hundreds of Ukrainian refugees removed from UK’s ‘unsuitable’ housing sponsors,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/08/hundreds-of-ukrainian-refugees-removed-from-uks-unsuitable-housing-sponsors
5/8/2022,"When you’re not well, chocolate is not easy to navigate. And despite my daily ice-cold showers and general robust constitution, I have crumpled, like a two-Christmas-old amaretti biscuit, in the face of an unnamed bug (not Covid). Luckily, just before I checked myself into the sick bay I had stockpiled my tasting. Matron has let me out to write this. Last week, I mentioned a Marks & Spencer bar that was very good, but this week I go one better with their Single Origin Dark Milk at 54% (beans from the Dominican Republic, £2/100g), which is so darn good it’s gone straight into my top 10 dark milks. At this price you need to buy quite a few bars. It’s got a wonderful strong but creamy taste. I just loved it. Another stunning supermarket bar is Asda’s just-launched Mint and Cocoa Nib Dark Chocolate (£2/150g). Everyone who tasted this remarked on how delicious it was, while raising an eyebrow when I told them where it was from. The addition of cocoa nibs is an inspired touch. At 52% cocoa, this is a gentle dark bar. Even if you don’t like mint chocolate I think you should try this, and if you do like mint, well… Thank me later. For something different, and definitely more artisanal, look to London Chocolate’s India, a 70% bar (£7.90/62g) made with Criollo and Forestero beans grown in southern India’s jungle-adjacent Anamalai Hills. In gorgeous packaging, this deep, earthy chocolate that makes you slow down and savour it, while doing some deep-thinking. Follow Annalisa on Twitter @AnnalisaB",Lifestyle/Food,Not feeling your best?

5/8/2022,"‘If trees could scream,’ wrote the US humorist Jack Handey, ‘would we be so cavalier about cutting them down?’ ‘We might,’ came his reply, ‘if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.’ I have often thought about this quote not just because it’s funny, but because it’s taken on new meaning in those long, deadening campaigns of constant screaming that accompany newborn life. It isn’t that mysterious at all, I suppose. Being a brand new human isn’t much fun. You’re overwhelmed, confused and constantly experiencing things you can’t yet understand. You also sleep a lot, so your conscious hours are an unbroken chain of rude awakenings. A lifetime of drudgery and disappointment has hardened us to the horror of being wrenched from the peace of sleep. I’ve been doing it for 36 years and still don’t much care for it. Imagine then, the baby’s lot; every moment one of being awoken to sights, sounds and smells you can’t begin to comprehend. Like awaking, on acid, at the apex of the Nemesis ride in Alton Towers, and for this to happen about 14 times a day. Who, if placed in this position, wouldn’t spend their whole day screaming and soiling themselves? In the face of this, any soothing I try to offer seems somewhat feckless. I spend my time telling her, lovingly but stupidly, to be quiet. In fact, I don’t really say it at all, opting instead for a para-verbal fricative uttered in low tones. I speak of, course, of shhh: that not-quite-a-word used since time immemorial to bend babies to our will. Shhh, as we all know, is a voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant, although it’s not something I’ve thought about much before it became 90% of my vocabulary, and sleep became, like a trip to the big Sainsbury’s in town with the nice sauces, a special treat I only get a few times a week. Theories as to the provenance of shhh vary, but the high static hiss is often said to recreate the noise of the womb, perhaps the light gush of blood which enveloped your miserable baby during happier times of bodily imprisonment. Whatever the case, it’s certainly one of the easiest syllables to form with the human mouth and since it requires no action from the vocal cords can be uttered – and I can attest to this – indefinitely. As such, shhh exists in just about every language and culture on earth. A Croatian may write ‘ššš’, and an Iranian ‘hīs’, but both would be readily identifiable as shhh to our, or their baby’s, ears. Less is known about those languages, like Old English and Latin, which entirely lack the soft shhh sound in common speech, and therefore raises the charming image of Roman dads soothing their babies to sleep while saying ‘skkk’ like a broken photocopier. Maybe that would be about as useful as my own efforts, which have mixed results to say the least. Her ears are closed and her mouth is open, disclaiming all the horror of things new, and for now it seems there’s nothing I, or Wikipedia’s linguistic section, can do about it. Shhh I reply, knowing full well that’s easy for me to say. Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

5/8/2022,"At the end of her wide-ranging analysis of the pandemic, Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, Guardian columnist and Good Morning Britain contributor, raises the dark question of whether Covid-19 will “be the spark for the third world war”. Written before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Sridhar’s book is the story of a global crisis that has since been supplanted, at least in the headlines, by another global crisis. This is the problem with writing about still unfolding events – it’s easy to look out of date. Sridhar is referring to what might happen if it is ever discovered that China knows much more about the origins of the pandemic than it has so far been willing to let on. How will the rest of the world react? If the Chinese regime’s foreknowledge of the virus remains uncertain, it’s clear that the only chance to prevent the international spread was in its very early stages. That’s when China was at first concerned to suppress news of the outbreak and afterwards content to allow the virus to be exported while busily stamping it out at home. Sridhar does not mince her words about China’s initial inaction and subsequent indifference to the global spread, nor does she dismiss the possibility that it was a laboratory leak that introduced Sars-CoV-2 to humanity. Still, even if China had acted swiftly and responsibly as soon as evidence emerged of a lethal virus in Wuhan, there is no guarantee that it could have contained it within China’s borders. In a sense, then, the book’s title is a misleading one. Given the nature of the virus – able to be passed on by the asymptomatic – once it was in public circulation, a pandemic was probably unpreventable. The question then becomes whether its effects, particularly the number of deaths, could have been reduced (last week, the World Health Organization estimated that the Covid death toll worldwide was nearly 15 million). Of this there seems little doubt and none in Sridhar’s mind. She looks at how different nations around the globe responded to the virus and seeks to establish the lessons of good and bad practice. In short, the UK and the US, the two nations that were thought to be the best prepared to combat a pandemic, were guilty of complacency and blinkered strategies. This is not a new accusation, having been argued in depth and repeatedly by any number of experts and authors. Sridhar doesn’t add any groundbreaking revelations to what is a strong case. The medical establishments in both countries leaned towards a “herd immunity” approach because they assumed that no vaccination would be available for several years at the earliest, if at all. It wasn’t an unreasonable assumption, given that there had never been a successful vaccination for any coronavirus and in any case vaccinations usually take about a decade to go from the lab to the public. As it turned out, both the UK and the US managed to produce vaccinations for Covid-19 in record times. But it’s obvious that in the period between outbreak and the arrival of the vaccines some nations did much better than others in inhibiting the virus and limiting deaths. Among those Sridhar praises are Senegal, Greece and South Korea. In terms of technological development and population size, South Korea is the closest to the UK, yet the British government and medical authorities appeared to think there was little that could be learned from east Asia. In this, as former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has argued, they were very much mistaken. Perhaps the main reason that South Korea was able to limit both lockdowns and deaths is that its test-and-trace system was, in pronounced contrast to our own, highly effective. However, this did involve an incursion into personal privacy that was unlikely to be accepted in this country. Koreans’ movements were so finely and publicly tracked that secret love affairs and even hidden sexualities were brought to light. Another reason for South Korea’s success, at least as far as Sridhar is concerned, was the widespread use of face masks. The scientific theories behind the virus’s transmission remain contested, but there does appear to be a broad correlation between the wearing of masks and reducing its spread. The UK was not alone in coming slowly, and often half-heartedly, to mask-wearing. The WHO’s advice was at first that there was no evidence to support face masks. It also argued against the need for international travel restrictions. Sridhar believes that this was a progressive stance but nonetheless a wrong one. In the UK’s case, though, she sees only ideological intransigence. “It was ironic,” she writes, “that a government that ran for election on the promise of ‘taking back control of our borders’ was so reluctant to implement border measures when they were actually necessary – in a pandemic.” Sridhar is good on pulling together disparate information and data from across the globe, although she never quite shapes it into a compelling narrative. Instead, it’s a thoughtful overall look at what happened in the world in 2020 and 2021. There are many lessons to be learned and Sridhar emphasises the fact that we need to think on a global level about how to react swiftly to local outbreaks – always erring on the side of caution because the alternative, as we’ve learned, can be catastrophic. To ready ourselves for the next viral challenge, it would help if there were a wholesale public rejection of conspiracy theories and the embracing of science. My favourite story from this book concerns Marc Van Ranst, a professor of virology and adviser to the Belgium government. For his work combatting the virus, he was threatened by a Belgian air force officer who went rogue with a submachine gun and four anti-tank missile launchers. The leader of a Dutch anti-lockdown/anti-vaxxer group, who happened to be a dance teacher, then suggested that Van Ranst had earned the death threat. “When there’s a salsa pandemic,” Van Ranst tweeted in reply, “I’ll listen to you with great pleasure. But at this moment, I don’t give a flying fuck what you have to say and nobody in the Netherlands should either.” Three cheers to that.

5/8/2022,"At the next general election, the Conservatives will be making a very big ask. They will be seeking a fifth consecutive term in power, a privilege that has never been granted to any party since the Great Reform Act of 1832. Assume the election is held in the spring of 2024. Imagine that the Tories receive the answer that they are looking for. We could then be contemplating 19 uninterrupted years of Conservative prime ministers. For those who shudder at this future, the consoling news is that the Tories are working extremely hard to ensure that this does not happen. It is not entirely their fault that they are presiding over the most severe squeeze on living standards since the 1950s. They are to blame for deciding that this is the appropriate time to be cutting welfare support and hiking taxes. Voters can be willing to make sacrifices when persuaded that it is in service of a noble cause, but the only guiding principle of this government is to keep a disgraced law-breaker in office. There is no sense of a strategy to address the many economic and social challenges confronting Britain. Nor any expectation, even among Tory MPs, that the government will suddenly reveal an invigorating mission in this week’s Queen’s speech. Levelling up has not graduated from slogan to substance. Promises of a huge house-building programme have collapsed on contact with resistance to planning reform. The energy security plan blinked at the big questions. The failure of Brexit to deliver the opportunities claimed for it is now so evident that Jacob Rees-Mogg has been told to go looking for them. Don’t hold your breath. There is no discernible ambition to tackle the chronically poor economic growth that has been a feature of this era of Tory rule. It is not just in their intellectual exhaustion that the Tories are exhibiting the morbid symptoms of a fin-de-siècle regime. Following the tawdry example set from the very top, they are enveloped in the sleaze that often characterises parties that have been squatting on power for too long. Two Tory MPs have recently been forced to resign their seats, one after being convicted of sexually assaulting a teenage boy and the other after being caught watching porn in the Commons. A third has been suspended from the parliamentary party pending investigation into allegations of cocaine use and sexual harassment. If you missed those scandals, don’t worry. Another will be along in a minute. That is the one thing that can be guaranteed by a government led by Boris Johnson. Voters are extremely fed up and have expressed their dissatisfaction in the time-honoured fashion. They used the local elections to give the Tories a hard kick in the ballots, but the thwack was not sufficiently eye-watering to instantly boot Mr Johnson out of Number 10. How parties react to election outcomes can be as illuminating as the results themselves. Labour made gains that put the electoral catastrophe of the Corbyn years behind them, but the party did not display the kind of momentum necessary to convince that Sir Keir Starmer is confidently striding in the direction of Downing Street. It is some encouragement for Labour that the shadow cabinet understands and acknowledges that their party still has far to go. Euphoric Liberal Democrats reaped the most gains on the night, but Sir Ed Davey’s jubilation is tempered by the knowledge that it is a demanding task to translate local election successes into more seats at Westminster. The Greens, the SNP and Sinn Féin all have reason to be cheerful. The Tories are responding to heavy losses with a mixture of fear and complacency. Fear among those MPs anxious that the formula that delivered victory in 2019 is disintegrating. Complacency among those who reckon these elections don’t mean much. Rather than reflect on why so many colleagues in local government have just lost their seats, Johnson loyalists prefer to mock Labour’s performance while expressing glee that Sir Keir is under investigation by Durham police for an alleged lockdown breach. The shoulder-shruggers say that the Tories are suffering nothing more than a case of the midterm blues. To their opponents, that should sound pleasingly insouciant about how much trouble the Conservatives are in. Really big trouble in the case of London. Labour’s gain of Barnet, with its large Jewish community, testifies to Sir Keir’s de-Corbynification of his party. The Tory losses of Wandsworth and Westminster speak more to the levels of discontent with the Conservatives. These councils were such sturdy citadels for the party that they kept the blue flame burning even during the depths of Tory austerity and the heights of New Labour’s popularity. Were I a Conservative MP with a seat in the capital, I’d be alarmed that the prime minister’s understrappers responded to the London results by suggesting they somehow didn’t matter because the city represents “the metropolitan elite”. The man who was the capital’s two-term mayor now employs people who treat Londoners with contempt. “It is idiotic, writing off London,” says one former Tory cabinet minister. “That’s no way to win an election in this country.” Thoughtful Tories ought to worry about what it says about them that most of the large metropolises, with their younger, vibrant, diverse, wealth-creating populations, have turned so hostile to the governing party. Tories across southern England have reasons to be fearful about their prospects. We have all heard a lot about “red wall” voters and how they delivered a majority to the Conservatives, but they didn’t do it on their own. There was another critical component: the centrist, broadly liberal voters in the “blue wall”. Many went with the Tories in 2019 not because they especially liked them, but because they shivered at the thought of prime minister Corbyn. There’s no risk of that any more, while Mr Johnson is still Mr Johnson and the consequences of that are much clearer to these voters. The Lib Dems have just made bags of gains at the expense of the Tories. The “yellow peril” is back to menace the Conservatives in their southern and shire heartlands. Tory MPs who had grown accustomed to not fretting about the Lib Dems are now nervously fingering the size of their majorities. All Conservative MPs who like power will worry that a Lib Dem resurgence makes the path to a Tory victory at the next election much more difficult. The Labour-Conservative battles in Brexit-voting areas of the Midlands and the north of England had more mixed results, but there things are likely to get worse for the Tories. As prices soar and public spending doesn’t keep pace, the cost of living crisis will be felt acutely in these areas. So when Conservative MPs look at the voter coalition that gave them power in 2019, many see cause to sweat that it is starting to unravel. “People used to think that only Boris could keep it together,” says one senior Tory. “The danger now is we lose both ends of the coalition because of him.” Local Tory leaders are explicit that their candidates were punished because of the grubby halo of law-breaking and sleaze around the Johnson regime. Ravi Govindia, ousted by the voters as leader of Wandsworth council, reported that “consistently on the doorstep, the issue of Boris Johnson was raised”. John Mallinson, the Conservative leader in Carlisle, blamed the loss of “some very good colleagues” on “the integrity issue”. “I just don’t feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.” Simon Bosher, the Tory leader in Portsmouth, told Mr Johnson to “take a good, long hard look in the mirror”. They are wasting their breath. Self-reflection and taking responsibility are alien to this prime minister. He also knows that recriminatory local Tories cannot evict him. Only MPs can do that. You can make a good case that these elections produced a worst-of-all worlds result for the Conservative party. The losses are bad enough to leave many of the Tories’ footsoldiers feeling sore and furious. They are painful enough to increase the already elevated levels of fractiousness among MPs. They are threatening enough to sharpen the feeling that their deeply unpopular leader is a drag anchor on their fortunes. These elections darken the weather for the Tory party. But they were not so catastrophic as to trigger such a deluge of panic among Tory MPs that they will immediately resolve to remove him. And that was probably the best result of all for the opposition parties, though not for the country.

5/8/2022,"Former Opals captain Jenna O’Hea has spoken about the incident which prompted Liz Cambage’s messy exit from the national program, alleging unconfirmed claims the star told her Nigerian rivals to “go back to your third-world country” are true. Cambage was independently investigated and issued a formal reprimand – but not suspended or fined – after last year’s practice-game altercation derailed the Opals’ Tokyo Olympics campaign. In the days after the Nigeria clash she withdrew from the Games citing mental health concerns and then, despite remaining available for selection for this year’s World Cup in Sydney, said she would never again play for the Opals. However, the specifics of Cambage’s on-court actions have remained a mystery since. On Sunday, while O’Hea was a guest on the ABC’s Offsiders program, she was asked about the incident by the show’s host, Kelli Underwood. “This all started in that training game, or the pre-Olympics game, when you played Nigeria,” Underwood said. “And it’s never really emerged what happened, but I’ve had it confirmed from a few sources, is it correct that you were playing Nigeria and Liz Cambidge had her feathers ruffled and she turned to them and said, ‘go back to your third world country’? “And, of course, Ezi Magbegor is originally Nigerian, a Nigerian who is now living in Australia and playing for your team, and as a result there was a brawl that erupted, and since then you haven’t spoken to her?” O’Hea responded with the claim: “That is all 100% correct.” Fellow guest Caroline Wilson then asked O’Hea whether Cambage would ever represent Australia again. “No,” O’Hea said. Last July, when Cambage unexpectedly withdrew from the Australian team on the eve of the Olympics, she called it “literally one of the hardest decisions of my life”. In a social media post, she also hit out at “lies” and “fake news” surrounding her decision and directly responded to speculation about the on-court incident during that scrimmage against Nigeria. “Yeah, things got heated in the Nigeria game, there was a physical altercation and there were words exchanged,” Cambage said. “But I’m hearing things that aren’t true at all. Everything that happened and everything I’ve said is on film.” Offsiders also aired footage of an ABC interview with Cambage from her base in Los Angeles, where she has started playing with WNBA side the LA Sparks. The 30-year-old, who has a Nigerian father, said: “I’m living my best life. I’m supported. I’m protected on a level that the Opals or the Australian team never gave to me. “My heart lies with those who want to protect me and those who want me to be the best I can be, and I never felt that at the Opals at all.” O’Hea, a long-time captain of Cambage, responded: “I can hold my head up high and say I always loved her, always cared for her, supported her, had her back. That is her reality and the listeners and watchers out there can believe who they want to believe. “Everyone’s done more than enough. We’ve sacrificed a lot to try and keep her in the program. She doesn’t want to be here anymore. That’s her choice and we need to move on without her.” O’Hea did say the Sparks appeared a good fit for Cambage. “She’s always wanted to be in LA,” she said. “I think she’s happy that she’s there, and when she’s happy she plays really good basketball.” The Opals struggled without Cambage in Tokyo but O’Hea said with proper preparation Sandy Brondello’s outfit would play to its ranking – which has long fluctuated between No 2 and No 3 in the world – at Sydney’s World Cup. Their September campaign could also mark the return of Lauren Jackson, who has dominated at NBL1 level for Albury-Wodonga since coming out of retirement. “There’s so many wonderfully talented basketballers in Australia, so many playing in the WNBA,” O’Hea said. “With the right preparation we can do really well. “There’s so many great role models ... I want the media to focus on those who want to play for the Opals and represent Australia.”",Sport/Sport,Former Opals captain alleges Liz Cambage made racist comment to Nigerian basketball players,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/08/former-opals-captain-alleges-liz-cambage-made-racist-comment-to-nigerian-basketball-players
