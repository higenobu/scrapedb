2/4/2022,"A man opened fire in a Greyhound bus Wednesday evening, killing a 43-year-old woman and wounding four others as the vehicle stopped in northern California. As the Los Angeles-bound bus stopped at an AM/PM convenience store in Oroville, a 21-year-old passenger who had exhibited “paranoid behavior” began shooting while people exited, according to officials in Butte county, where the incident took place. Shortly after, police arrested the suspect, naked, inside a nearby Walmart.  “Last night was an extraordinary event in our small town of Oroville, a mass shooting – something we have not had in the community,” said Mike Ramsey, the district attorney, at a press conference Thursday morning. Police began receiving calls about the shooting shortly after 7.30pm and responded to the chaotic scene within a minute, officials said. Of the approximately 25 passengers, five people were injured, including a 43-year-old woman who died at the scene. An 11-year-old girl, a 25-year-old woman who is pregnant, a 38-year-old man and a 32-year-old man were also injured. At least one of the victims was shot multiple times. The suspect is 21-year-old Asaahdi Coleman, who shortly after boarding the bus showed “what could best be described as paranoid behavior”, the Butte county sheriff, Kory Honea, said. Passengers on the bus told police that after a phone call Coleman began acting agitated, and showed people a gun he was carrying. Coleman reportedly suspected one of the passengers on the bus was an undercover police officer, which led to a confrontation, Honea said, before he allegedly began to randomly open fire as people exited, shooting through seats and the windshield. Witnesses say the suspect fired more than 10 shots, and officials reported they recovered a dozen 9 mm bullet casings. The suspect ran off before officers arrived. But they located Coleman inside a nearby Walmart, where he had reportedly gotten into an argument with a woman in the store and took his clothes off. Police took him into custody without incident, Honea said. He was wanted on a warrant out of another county for being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm. “This particular individual in no way shape or form should have been in possession of a firearm,” Honea said. Officials will release the name of the woman who was killed in the incident pending notification of her family. Though the US went a year without a high-profile mass shooting during first 12 months of the pandemic, daily gun violence has soared. According to FBI statistics, the US saw its largest-ever recorded annual increase in murders in 2020 as the national murder rate rose nearly 30%.",News/US news,Woman killed and four others injured after man opens fire on bus in California,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/03/greyhound-bus-shooting-oroville-woman-killed
2/4/2022,"Russia and Ukraine will face one another on Friday in a historic Uefa futsal European championship encounter against a backdrop of political tension over the threat of renewed conflict between the nations. The semi-final in Uefa’s showpiece five-a-side tournament will take place amid “specific security plans” implemented at Amsterdam’s Ziggo Dome arena to ensure the event’s safety, Uefa told the Guardian.  It is the first men’s competitive meeting between the nations in a Uefa tournament since 2007. The last match in football was a Euro 2000 qualifier in 1999. The only competitive game since the conflict over Crimea in 2014 was in the inaugural Uefa women’s futsal Euros in 2019. Uefa has kept Russia and Ukraine and their clubs apart in draws since 2014 but accepts that cannot apply to the entire knockout stages of tournaments. “Uefa expects fair play by the two teams, on and off the pitch,” it said in a statement to the Guardian. Coaches and players from both sides were keen on Thursday to play down the politically sensitive nature of the match. Petro Shoturma, the Ukraine captain, admitted the Euro 22 tournament was “the most difficult in our history” and insisted the players were focused only on the match. “We have no special secrets,” he said, when asked how Ukraine would put aside the political tensions. “But we are all together as a team. With our character and our spirit, we will try to win. The only principle for us is that this is a semi-final. This is the only thing important.” Amid concern over the game becoming a flashpoint, Oleksandr Kosenko, Ukraine’s head coach, insisted they “fully support fair play” but accepted that interest in the match in Ukraine was fierce: “We feel the emotions and support from all people but also from other countries. We are not living on an island, we all communicate in other countries. Tomorrow we will do our best to secure a positive result.” Responding to a question over the game’s significance, Russia’s captain, Sergey Abramov, said: “It’s a special match because it’s a semi-final. It doesn’t matter who we play … Maybe you want me to talk about political things but we are going to speak only about sports.” Russia’s coach, Sergei Skorovich, dismissed the “rumours and talk” about politics and said they would “concentrate only on the futsal”. Unconfirmed reports said Russia had doubled the bonuses on offer to their players for a win. Attendances are limited by Covid restrictions to 1,250. It is unclear how many Russian and Ukrainian fans will be in the 17,000-capacity arena, where Russian and Ukrainian flags hang side by side next to a Uefa respect banner above the court. In the buildup, one of the Ukraine players, Danyil Abakshyn, posted a picture of himself in a Ukraine shirt, an image that revisited the controversy at the football European championships when Ukraine were forced to remove the phrase “Glory to the Heroes” from a shirt carrying a map containing Crimea. “The political background of this meeting cannot be discarded,” the president of the Russian Futsal Association, Emil Aliyev, told Match TV on Wednesday. He insisted the Ukrainian Futsal Association were “our friends” and said: “It would be better if everyone sorted out the relationship – who is stronger or faster – on the sports grounds.” Russia’s Ivan Chishkala, who plays club futsal for Benfica, also tried to calm tensions. “We communicate with the guys [from Ukraine], we don’t have any animosity,” he told Tass. Uefa told the Guardian: “The Dutch LOS [local organising structure] – with the support of Uefa – is using its best efforts so as to ensure that the event will take place safely and, in this respect, is working on implementing specific security plans.” Russia and Ukraine are among futsal’s European elite. Russia have won one title, in 1999, and finished runners-up five times since the first Euros in 1996. Ukraine have been runners-up twice. The holders and world champions, Portugal, contest the second semi-final on Friday night with Spain, serial winners of the tournament. The final is on Sunday and games are screened live on Uefa TV.",Sport/Football,‘We feel the emotions’: Ukraine and Russia meet for place in futsal final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/ukraine-and-russia-meet-for-place-in-futsal-final
2/4/2022,"Good morning. The leader of the Islamic State has died. Extreme weather in Western Australia is causing a food supply crisis. And new figures show the ABC’s funding has been cut by $526m since 2014. Joe Biden on Thursday said United States special forces “successfully removed a major threat to the world” after the leader of Islamic State, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, blew himself up in a pre-dawn raid in Syria. “As troops approached, in a final act of desperate cowardice” Qurayshi blew himself up the third floor of a house, killing his own family members, the US president said. For nearly two decades, Qurayshi was a central figure in the terrorism juggernaut that became the Islamic State. From fighter, to prisoner, strategist to leader, there were not many parts of the insurgency in which the 46-year-old jihadist had not had a hand. But though Qurayshi is now dead, the Islamic State still lurks in the rubble.  Western Australia’s food supply crisis is “the worst in living memory” with the state’s umbilical cord to the eastern states severed, not by Covid or border closure but by extreme weather. Flooding in South Australia has washed out more than 300km of the only rail line that brings food and supplies into WA from the east coast. With border closures already isolating WA from the nation and the world, a one in 200-year weather event is squeezing inbound supplies, leaving many supermarket shelves bare. The Morrison government is being urged by one of its own backbenchers to “face facts” and accept the use of the term apartheid in relation to Israel. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said that “no country is perfect” in response to a new Amnesty International report that concluded Israel had “perpetrated the international wrong of apartheid, as a human rights violation and a violation of public international law”. But Ken O’Dowd, a Queensland Liberal National party MP, said he would encourage the Australian government to take the report “on board” and act on some of its findings. Refugees previously held in detention on Nauru have turned down the chance of a US visa because their partners – also accepted as refugees – have been denied permission to join them. The principal of a Brisbane school that demanded families sign anti-gay and anti-trans enrolment contracts previously lobbied senators to allow employers “the right to discriminate” against homosexuals. The pandemic is disproportionately affecting women, who are more likely to lose work or have caring responsibilities. The majority of Australians would support restoring funding to the ABC, according to a new poll, after new figures showed funding has been cut by $526m since the Coalition’s first budget. New buy now, pay later-style schemes targeting renters are “preying on the vulnerable”, say consumer advocates who have renewed calls for the federal government to overhaul credit laws to better regulate the sector. Europe could soon enter a “long period of tranquillity” that amounts to a “ceasefire” in the pandemic thanks to the less severe Omicron variant, high levels of immunity and the arrival of warmer spring weather, the World Health Organization has said. Boris Johnson’s longstanding policy chief, Munira Mirza, has dramatically quit over the prime minister’s attempt to associate Keir Starmer with the failure to prosecute paedophile Jimmy Savile. A key figure in the corruption trial of Israel’s former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu may have been illegally bugged by police, according to reports, amid global controversy about Israeli-made spyware and how it has been used. The US decision to deploy more than 3,000 US troops in Germany, Poland and Romania is a “destructive step” that makes it harder to reach a compromise over Ukraine, Russia’s deputy foreign minister has said, as Moscow continues to build up its forces. As the military targets civilians and blocks aid in Myanmar, those who have left home to avoid violence risk death to find food and healthcare Despite the rise of headline-grabbing megafires, fewer fires are burning worldwide now than at any time since antiquity. But this isn’t good news – we have made their dangers stranger and less predictable. Cold Enough for Snow is the second book from Melbourne writer Jessica Au. It won her the first Novel prize in 2020 and comes a decade after her acclaimed debut, Cargo. The plot, however, is simple; “deceptively” so, as some reviews have noted: mother and adult daughter visit Japan, see the sights, take in art and food, go home. Omicron felled Brigid Delaney but, like the unheard tree in the forest, she couldn’t prove it. “Like a lot of people, I reckon I caught the virus in early January during the perfect storm of the Omicron wave, mass infections, an unprepared government and a stressed and broken testing regime,” Delaney writes. “If you were exposed to the virus and had the symptoms, but no one is around to test you, did you have Covid?” Covid statistics have become a fixture of our day but those numbers tell us very little about the people who have died. And does the language around how deaths are reported undervalue the lives lost? Gabrielle Jackson talks to Lenore Taylor and Mike Ticher about why it’s so hard to talk about Covid deaths.

2/4/2022,"Joe Biden has said “the answer is not to defund the police” and emphasized community policing efforts as he met in New York with the new mayor, Eric Adams, to discuss the uptick in gun violence during the pandemic.  The president added of his preferred approach to fighting crime: “It’s to give you the tools, the training, the funding to be partners, to be protectors and to know the community.” In the wake of the failure so far by Congress to pass the police reform legislation that was introduced after the murder of George Floyd, the White House said the president is exploring other avenues to reform, such as executive order. “When I wrote the first crime bill, I noticed that I don’t hear many communities – no matter what their color, their background – saying, ‘I don’t want more protection in my community,’” Biden said. “I haven’t found one of those yet.” The president reiterated his previous remarks that funding from the American Rescue Plan should be used to hire more police officers, pay police overtime and employ technology that locates gun shots. He also focused on gun manufacturers, saying it is “the only industry in America that is exempted from being sued, and I find it to be outrageous”. He pressed for community intervention programs, saying: “They work. They work.” Biden and Adams met to discuss collaborative efforts between local, state, and federal officials amid spiking gun crime rates in New York and in other major cities nationwide. Advocates are angered at new strategies from Biden and Adams that call for increased investment in policing, a move they say will not make communities safer or address pandemic-related crime increases. In New York, shooting incidents have been increasing: in 2020, there were 1,531 shootings in New York, more than twice the number in 2019. In 2021, 1,562 shootings were recorded, a roughly 2% increase from the previous year and the highest number recorded since 2003. Biden’s visit follows the recent funerals for two New York police department (NYPD) officers, Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera, who were both killed last month while responding to a domestic violence call. Gun crimes have also escalated in other major cities, including Chicago and Los Angeles, which both reported an increase in homicides involving firearms. Ahead of Biden’s visit, Adams told WCBS 880 he would ask the president to “have a 9/11 response to the terror of violence that’s playing out on American cities throughout this entire country.” Adams, who published his own strategy to address gun crime in New York last week, has called for the use of facial recognition technology to identify people carrying weapons, for more spot checks in public transit stations and for more NYPD patrol officers. “That’s the omnipresence that we need,” he said, lauding increased police presence on the city’s subway. The Biden administration has made similarly hawkish statements on crime. The White House previously called for cities to use stimulus money to “put more cops on the beat” and has repeatedly stated that Biden does not support defunding the police. Shortly before leaving for his New York visit, Biden also instructed every US attorney’s office to prioritize prosecution of gun trafficking offenses and increase resources for strategies to curb violent crimes. Activists are wary about increased investments in policing and carceral solutions from the Biden administration. “You can’t just say you’ll invest in community violence intervention, and in the same breath add even more money to ineffective and dangerous policing tactics,” said Chicago youth activist Trevon Bosley in a statement with the anti-gun violence non-profit March for Our Lives. “We can’t afford to take one step forward and two steps backward.”",News/US news,‘The answer is not defunding the police’: Joe Biden in meeting with NY mayor,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/03/joe-biden-defund-police-new-york-eric-adams
2/4/2022,"All prime ministers lose advisers at various points, but those working for Boris Johnson seem to jump ship or otherwise exit at a faster rate than most. Here is a list of significant people who have left his No 10.  Johnson’s longstanding policy chief and lead architect of his culture-war policies, who also worked with Johnson when he was London mayor, quit over the prime minister’s attempt to associate Keir Starmer with the failure to prosecute the paedophile Jimmy Savile. In a strongly worded resignation letter, Mirza called the comments “inappropriate and partisan” and called for Johnson to apologise. Quitting on the same afternoon as Mirza – though it was claimed not to be connected – was head of communications at Downing Street from April last year, having previously held the deputy’s role. Formerly an experienced political journalist, Doyle had been somewhat in the glare of claims about lockdown-breaching parties, with reports that he made a speech and handed out awards at a Christmas event in December 2020. Not officially a resignation – Downing Street stressed at the time he was pushed out – the departure of Cummings in November 2020 was nonetheless dramatic. Johnson’s former chief aide exited the No 10 front door carrying a box of possessions after a bitter internal power struggle. He has since spent much of his time taking potshots at “the shopping trolley”, as he terms Johnson for his supposed wildly veering views. Departing at the same time as Cummings, Johnson’s former communications chief quit his post at No 10 amid the same power struggle. A former journalist turned Johnson adviser, who loyally stuck with him in his backbench wilderness period, Cain was another veteran of the Vote Leave campaign. Johnson’s ethics adviser quit in November 2020 after the prime minister refused to sack the home secretary, Priti Patel, despite a formal investigation finding evidence that she had bullied civil servants. Allan said Patel’s conduct “amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying”, noting instances of shouting and swearing and finding that she had breached the ministerial code, even if unintentionally. The head of the UK government’s legal department resigned after a significant disagreement with the attorney general for England and Wales over plans to override parts of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. Jones had repeatedly disagreed with Suella Braverman over points of law, but the final straw came over her interpretation of the EU agreement. Johnson’s adviser on civil society and communities resigned after a row over a report on racial disparities, which concluded that the UK did not have a systemic problem with racism. Kasumu was the prime minister’s most senior black adviser. He had previously said in a letter that he was considering his resignation over the conduct of the minister Kemi Badenoch, suggesting she may have broken the ministerial code when she publicly criticised a black journalist on social media, and that tensions over race policies within No 10 had become unbearable.",News/UK news,"It’s not me, it’s you: the political advisers who left Boris Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/03/its-not-me-its-you-the-political-advisers-who-left-boris-johnson
2/4/2022,"It’s like something from a Guillermo del Toro film: a grotesque fantasy creature derobes itself, only to reveal an even more horrifying monster underneath. But that’s what viewers will see when the US version of The Masked Singer, Fox’s incognito singing competition, returns at the end of this month. The show, in which both the panel of judges and the audience try to guess the identity of celebrities vocalists dressed in furry theme park costumes, is taped in advance of airing. But Deadline reports that at the first episode’s climax, when the eliminated singer reveals their true identity, it was Rudy Giuliani whose head popped out of the costume. Judges Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke walked off the set in protest. Quite a good reflection of how bad a guy you have to be when rape culture chanteur Thicke, the singer of Blurred Lines, decides you’re beyond the pale.  The disbarred attorney and former mayor of New York who played one of the largest roles in trying to overthrow 250 years of American democracy is now under investigation for bribing foreign powers to investigate his political opponent, lying about election fraud and trying to actively overturn votes in some cases by seizing voting machines or ignoring electoral counts. It would be fair to say that the only reason the results of a democratic presidential election were not overturned in the US is because Giuliani’s attempts were thwarted. So what better place for this cuddly henchman to hide from law enforcement than on a cosplay singing show. No footage has yet been released of what outfit Giuliani was wearing, although Giuliani doesn’t need a monster costume to scare children. Indeed, it’s hard to imagine how the producers came up with something more grotesque than his own smirking face, seen recently on the Borat sequel making creepy sex eyes at an actor he believed was a young journalist as he reached into his trousers and touched his genitals. The format began in Korea, but has since been exported round the world and become one of the most successful non-scripted series in the US of the last decade. Stars from every era, including Gladys Knight, T-Pain, Jojo and Jewel, have found career rejuvenation after appearing on the show as furrier versions of themselves. But the masks have also been a way on sneaking controversial figures who may not normally be accepted on prime time. Logan Paul, who uploaded footage of a suicide victim to his YouTube channel, was eliminated in season 5, and in season 3 a cuddly pink bear that rapped Sir Mix-a-Lot’s Baby Got Back was revealed to be former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Palin later commented that her appearance was “a walking middle finger to the haters out there”. Reality TV provides a fantastic and powerful form of reputation washing, in which all participants are celebrated “for being able to laugh at themselves”, as if that was a greater attribute that not being a fascist. There is a reason that Guliani, Palin, Sean Spicer (Dancing with the Stars), Anthony Scaramucci and Omarosa (Celebrity Big Brother) have all attempted to use entertainment, rather than politics to revive their reputations, and it’s not just because they enjoying turning network television into a moralless Hunger Games universe where propagandists with blood on their hands shimmy in sparkles in between adverts for pharmaceuticals and Tostitos. Shows like The Masked Singer encourage viewers to think of politicians personalities as somehow separate from their political positions. We’ll have to wait until next month to find out what Giuliani wore. Until then, we’re just left to imagine what stench uncontrolled flatulence might create in a costume that producers have previously warmed can get dangerously hot.",Global,Rudy Giuliani doesn’t need a monster costume to scare children,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/feb/03/rudy-giuliani-monster-costume-scare-children
2/4/2022,"Civil service bosses may never know which of their staff are fined by police for attending Covid rule-breaking parties, a leaked memo issued by the Cabinet Office has revealed. The five-page advice document for those who could be spoken to by Scotland Yard over 12 alleged gatherings also reassured staff it was “unlikely” their security clearance would be revoked if they were issued with a £100 fixed penalty notice.  Whitehall workers were told to “cooperate fully” with the Metropolitan police, and that while there was no fixed end point to officers’ inquiries they would be kept “updated as timelines become clearer”. Advice was given for people to join a union to get legal support – if they wanted it – while those who wanted “time off” to handle the stress of the investigation were told they would be supported “through this difficult period” and given “flexibility”. More than 70 witnesses were interviewed by senior civil servant Sue Gray’s team, as part of her investigation into a string of alleged parties in No 10 and across Whitehall when Covid restrictions were in place. At least three of the events were attended by the prime minister, Boris Johnson: a “bring your own booze” drinks gathering on 20 May 2020 in the Downing Street garden, a birthday celebration in No 10 on 19 June and a leaving do for a senior aide on 14 January 2021. The Met launched an investigation last week, stymying the publication of Gray’s full report: she was only able to release an “update”, which took aim at “failures of leadership and judgment” at the top of government. In an update to those who may be contacted by Scotland Yard, the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team wrote a “question and answer” sheet for potential interviewees. It stated that a fixed penalty notice was not a “criminal conviction” or “a finding of guilt” but a “mechanism by which someone … can avoid prosecution and the matter will be considered dealt with”. In response to the question of whether the civil service would make public details of who received a fine for breaking Covid laws, the document said: “No. The Met will not publish the names of those who have received FPNs and the civil service will not know the details of recipients.” To those concerned that getting a fixed penalty notice could affect their security clearance, the Cabinet Office recommended that people report it to the vetting system. It added: “Clearance is considered on a case-by-case basis but it is unlikely that in and of itself an FPN would lead to your clearance being revoked.” Civil servants were told that a special liaison unit had been set up “to help manage the relationship between government and the Met investigation”. This would provide “accurate information about the status of the Met investigation and process”. Disciplinary proceedings could be launched against some civil servants, the document suggested. But it said these would be “taken in according to department HR policies once the CO [Cabinet Office] and Met processes have concluded”. In response to a question about whether the civil service would pay a fine, the document said: “No. FPNs apply to individuals and would not be funded by the taxpayer.” Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said that the culture in Downing Street had been set by Johnson, and he was still “refusing to take responsibility or show the leadership that the country needs”. She added: “His actions have led to a police investigation, yet it is civil servants and staff who could be left to pay with their careers. It is vital that whistleblowers are now protected and ministers held properly to account. “The full Sue Gray report must be published, and the cover-ups ended once and for all.” Johnson earlier this week said he was “sorry for the things we simply did not get right and sorry for the way this matter has been handled”. However, he still insists he has not broken any Covid rules nor misled parliament by claiming as much in the Commons.",News/Politics,Civil service bosses ‘may never know if staff fined by police for No 10 parties’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/civil-service-bosses-may-never-know-if-staff-fined-by-police-for-no-10-parties
2/4/2022,"The New South Wales government will not seek to mandate booster shots for healthcare workers, despite calls from Victoria to change the definition of a fully vaccinated person to include a third dose. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) is currently preparing advice for national cabinet that is expected to recommend expanding the definition of full vaccination against Covid-19 to three shots.  The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has pushed hard for the change. Essential workers in that state have already been told they must get their third dose to continue working on site, and Andrews suggested last week the requirement may be expanded to people wishing to access hospitality venues. South Australia has also already mandated the booster jab for workers in healthcare, aged care, and people with disabilities, while the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, said it was “increasingly likely” that people would need a third dose to be considered fully vaccinated. Last week the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said changing the definition of fully vaccinated “makes sense”, and in early January the state’s health minister, Brad Hazzard, said that “anybody for whom vaccination was mandatory already will now have boosters mandated”. But on Thursday Hazzard told the Guardian that after consulting with both the Health Services Union and the Nurses and Midwives’ Association the state government would no longer push ahead with the mandate for the state’s strained health workers. “Certainly in early January, when the numbers were increasing dramatically off the back of Omicron and before the number of furloughed workers started dropping, as health minister I was certainly serious about moving towards a mandate position for the third dose,” he said. “But I also then did what I hope any sensible health minister would do and that is talk to those that represent our health workers, being the HSU and also the Nurses and Midwives’ Association and others, and they made it clear that health workers are, as we all know, quite exhausted and tired from two years of intense frontline work.” Hazzard did not indicate whether the change in approach would also apply to other essential workers. While Atagi is expected to advise a shift in the definition of a fully vaccinated person to include a third dose, Hazzard said that was a separate issue from making booster shots mandatory. “We’ve decided to take essentially a more encouraging and nurturing approach to getting them all [boosted], rather than forcing the issue and jumping in with mandates,” he said. “They are all double vaccinated and chances are they will proceed to get a booster regardless. They’re health workers and the vast majority would understand the need to get the booster. “That’s the current position NSW is taking. We would like to work with our health workers.” On Thursday, NSW Labor criticised the government for not having already introduced the booster mandate for health workers, following a Sydney Morning Herald report that showed while 68% of those in their 70s had been boosted, less than a third of people under 40 have had the third shot. “Every bit of international evidence indicates that a third dose of vaccine is essential in fighting Omicron and future Covid variants,” the Labor leader, Chris Minns, said. “I want to make it very clear that it’s not a case [of] forcing people to take a dose that they don’t want to take. 94.9% of people in this state who are of adult age have two doses of that vaccine.” But the secretary of the Health Services Union, Gerard Hayes, told the Guardian he had lobbied the government not to push ahead with a third-dose mandate. “It’s been two and a bit years, health workers are tired. They’re beyond tired. They’re chronically fatigued and at the edge of their tether. We don’t believe you can just put a health order on top of a health order. This is about bringing people with you. “They’re health workers. They don’t need a ‘do this or else’. We’re all mature and we know what’s going on now. We have said, don’t drop another bomb on them and say, ‘Here, do this’. It is not clear how the NSW government would have enforced any mandate, with the Guardian able to reveal that the state has not kept track of how many health workers in the state have received booster shots so far. In response to questions asked in parliament this week the government said the state’s health department only held vaccination data for “employees who are vaccinated by a NSW Health service”. But all employees who received a vaccination by “providers external to NSW Health” such as pharmacists or GPs were not required to log their vaccination status. “Staff who choose to be vaccinated by providers external to NSW Health are not required to disclose their third dose vaccination and these records may not be captured,” the minister’s office stated. The government said that as of 18 January, some 35.1% of clinical staff and 29.7% of non-clinical staff have had their third covid vaccine recorded. But that data did not include “healthcare workers employed in the private or other sectors outside of NSW Health”. Minns told the Guardian it was “extraordinary that the government does not have an accurate number of how many of its essential health staff have had a booster”. “We all know the third shot is critical to protect against Omicron. But what we don’t know is how many of our essential healthcare workers are actually protected by a booster shot because this government simply isn’t tracking that.” ",News/Australia news,NSW backtracks on making vaccine boosters mandatory for health workers,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/nsw-backtracks-on-making-vaccine-boosters-mandatory-for-health-workers
2/4/2022,"Rishi Sunak has warned households suffering from Britain’s worsening cost of living crisis to brace themselves for further increases in energy costs later this year, as critics said his £9bn emergency package was insufficient to prevent millions more struggling with fuel poverty. Prompted into action by the prospect of the average household paying an extra £700 a year for gas and electricity, the chancellor said he accepted it was a “very difficult time” but that a combination of temporary, repayable discounts and council tax rebates would help soften the blow.  Sunak said that as things stood, the price cap of £1,971 set by the energy regulator Ofgem would rise further in the autumn, prompting calls for the government to do more to help those on the poorest incomes. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said even with the government support, the number of people living in fuel stress – in households where more than 10% of the budget is spent on energy – would double to 5 million. “These energy crisis measures are woefully inadequate and will leave those on the lowest incomes and in the least efficient homes in deep peril,” said Adam Scorer, the chief executive of charity National Energy Action. “We needed deep, targeted support for the most vulnerable. We have shallow, broad measures for all. That simply does not work.” Under the Treasury plan, 28 million electricity customers will have £200 knocked off their bills in October, with the money repaid in £40 annual instalments over the next five years. Council tax payers in England in bands A to D will receive a rebate of £150 from their bills in April, which will not have to be paid back, while separate sums have been set aside for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to use as the devolved governments see fit. Local authorities will receive £150m to make discretionary payments to 300,000 poorer families who live in homes in a council tax band above D, while the number of households eligible for the warm homes discount – worth £150 from October – is to be increased by a third to 3m. The chancellor’s package came as the Bank of England accompanied an increase in interest rates to 0.5% with a warning that living standards in the next two years would take their biggest hit in at least three decades. Threadneedle Street said it expected the annual inflation rate – already 5.4% – to peak at more than 7% this spring, with prices rising far faster than wages. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, said he was concerned by the impact higher borrowing costs would have on poorer households already hit by rising fuel bills. Households face an unprecedented two-year hit to their living standards after a fall in real average incomes this year of 2% and a fall in 2023 of 1.5%. However, Bailey argued that the cost of living crisis would worsen if inflation was allowed to spiral out of control. “We have not raised interest rates today because the economy is roaring away,” he said. “An increase in Bank Rate is necessary because it is unlikely that inflation will return to target without it.” Speaking at a press conference, Sunak said there was nothing the government could do to affect the rising global price of energy but he hoped his measures would ease anxiety over the cost of living. He said: “£350 is a significant amount of money that will make a big difference to the vast majorities of households and I hope actually people will be reassured by us stepping in to provide that support.” Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said Labour’s plan to cut VAT on energy bills and make the warm homes discount for poorer households more generous would have covered most of the £700 increase for struggling households. On the day Shell reported a quadrupling of annual profits to $19bn (£14bn) after cashing in on rocketing oil and gas prices, she criticised the chancellor for failing to impose a windfall tax on corporations. “The chancellor wants to load costs on taxpayers with a buy now, pay later scheme – while Labour will keep bills low with a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers with booming profits,” Reeves said. “In the midst of a cost of living crisis, the government’s proposals will leave families in Britain paying hundreds of pounds more as a result of the breathtaking rise in energy prices. It will be of little comfort to many.” Analysis by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation – a charity that focuses on measures to alleviate poverty – showed that, even accounting for Sunak’s support package, families on low incomes would be spending an average of 16% of their incomes after housing costs on energy bills, compared with 5% for middle-income families. Single-adult households on low incomes would spend a “shocking” 43% on average of their income after housing costs on energy bills, it found. Joanna Elson, the chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said: “The government’s support measures will help a little – but energy rises will hurt a lot. Low-income households need the government to go further – with support that matches the full scale of the problem. This should include uprating benefits and, thinking ahead, increasing the support available through the warm momes discount.” Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, said: “Overall, of course, this package will not stop average incomes and living standards from falling over the coming year. An average earner on £30,000 a year will still be around £400 worse off next fiscal year than this. An out-of-work lone parent is likely to be over £300 worse off.” “The withdrawal of the £200 support for energy costs in 12 months’ time, accompanied by a £40-a-year repayment, will at best dampen any recovery in living standards going forward.” The IFS said the council tax rebate was only loosely targeted at the neediest people. Almost half of those living in homes in council tax banks A to D were in the top half of the income distribution, some of them in the top income bracket.",News/Business,Rishi Sunak tells Britons to brace for even higher energy costs in autumn,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/rishi-sunak-tells-britons-to-brace-for-even-higher-energy-costs-in-autumn
2/4/2022,"US officials claim they have evidence of a Russian plan to make a “very graphic” fake video of a Ukrainian attack as a pretext for an invasion. The alleged plot would involve using corpses, footage of blown-up buildings, fake Ukrainian military hardware, Turkish-made drones and actors playing the part of Russian-speaking mourners.  “We don’t know definitively that this is the route they are going to take, but we know that this is an option under consideration,” the deputy national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, told MSNBC, adding that the video “would involve actors playing mourners for people who are killed in an event that they would have created themselves”. Finer added: “That would involve the deployment of corpses to represent bodies purportedly killed, of people purportedly killed in an incident like this.” The Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, said the video would have purported to show a Ukrainian attack on Russian territory or Russian-speaking people in eastern Ukraine and would be “very graphic”. He added that the US believed that the plan had the backing of the Kremlin. “Our experience is that very little of this nature is not approved at the highest levels of the Russian government,” Kirby said. US officials said the video would show Turkish-made Bayraktar drones taking part in the fabricated attack as a way of implicating Nato. The claims are being made in the midst of a war of nerves between Russia and the US and its allies, in which diplomatic exchanges and intelligence briefings are playing out alongside a relentless Russian military buildup around Ukraine’s borders, and US and allied threats of devastating punitive economic measures if an attack goes ahead. Administration officials said the plan was to use the video as evidence of Ukrainian “genocide” against Russian speakers to justify Russian military intervention. By going public, the US hoped to stall or slow down Moscow’s plans. Finer said it would “make it much more difficult for them after the fact to claim that they had to do whatever they decided to do”. The New York Times and Washington Post first published versions of the account given by administration officials, noting that the officials did not provide evidence for the US claims. Britain said it agreed with the US assessment, having conducted its own analysis of the intelligence reports. The two countries routinely share intelligence as part of the wider Five Eyes network – and London has been as ready as Washington to highlight what both see as an acute Russian threat to Ukraine. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said the disclosures were “clear and shocking evidence of Russia’s unprovoked aggression and underhand activity to destabilise Ukraine”. She added: “The UK and our allies will continue to expose Russian subterfuge and propaganda and call it out for what it is.” The US and UK have alleged that Russia has deployed operatives inside Ukraine to stage false-flag attacks and has recruited Ukrainians to take over a puppet government that would collaborate with Russian occupation forces. James Roscoe, a British diplomat at the United Nations said: “Russia says it will never invade Ukraine. Unless it is provoked. So ‘just in case’ it is provoked it has massed over 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border. “But how is it that they are able to anticipation that provocation?” Roscoe asked on Twitter. “Perhaps because they are planning to stage that provocation?” While massing troops around Ukraine, Russian officials have made repeated claims, without evidence, that Kyiv was planning to attack Russia or Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine rather than the other way round. Last week, a Moscow-backed separatist leader in eastern Ukraine, Denis Pushilin, repeated a frequent Russian claim that Ukraine had plans to launch a chemical attack on the breakaway region. Thursday’s claims were the latest in a series of US briefings on American intelligence assessments, some of which have irritated Ukraine’s leadership and been rebuffed by officials in Kyiv. Last weekend, Reuters and CNN cited senior US officials claiming Russia had moved blood supplies close to the border, indicating a potential imminent military attack. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, denounced the blood supply claim, calling it a provocation designed “to spread panic and fear in our society”. On Thursday, Maliar told the Guardian she had checked that claim with Ukrainian intelligence agencies, which had their own sources. “It simply wasn’t true. We found no information to back this up, we did not see any blood supplies moved to the front or even in the civilian hospitals around the front,” she said, in an interview at a military airfield at Boryspil, outside Kyiv. “It’s really important to look at the sources. These sources were anonymous, and I don’t think it’s right to use anonymous sources that cannot be checked,” she said.",News/World news,"Russia plans ‘very graphic’ fake video as pretext for Ukraine invasion, US claims",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/ukraine-russia-fake-attack-video-us-claims
