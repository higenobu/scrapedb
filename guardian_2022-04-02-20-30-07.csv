4/2/2022,"Born in London in 1964, Milton Jones is a standup comic and recurring face on Mock the Week. Known for his striking hair, Hawaiian shirts, and unflinching expression, he won the Edinburgh Perrier award in 1996 with his sharp, pun-based one-liners. He has since had a prolific career creating standup sets, BBC Radio 4 shows and books. Now living in Richmond upon Thames, Milton has one brother, Andy, who works in travel technology, and is married with three children. Milton Impossible tours the UK and Ireland throughout 2022. My brother is one in this photo and I must be two and a half. I presume we were given toy cars to calm us down – my parents had hired a photographer to take pictures of us while we were in Belfast at my grandparents’ house. It looks like we’ve been posing for too long, I’ve clearly just had a haircut and we’re a bit miserable. But we were on good behaviour. We were on good behaviour a lot of the time, really. Convicts together in a pushchair. Coming from quite a serious Christian home put me on the outside looking in. We didn’t have a television until I was eight. We weren’t allowed to go to birthday parties on a Sunday. We mixed happily and got on with other children, but there was always a sense that we were different. Luckily, Andy and I had each other. Our parents were very conservative, cautious and introverted. Having older relatives, and us being the only children, we were quite often wheeled out as entertainment. For example, if we’d been to see the changing of the guard, we’d reenact it for them. I was incredibly shy, but when we used to play football I could be robust and shouty. One day someone kicked Andy on the pitch and I lost it. There’s something visceral about being a big brother. I was in such a rage I didn’t even kick the right person back, which was a shame. I was not a rebellious teen. The most disobedient thing I did was cycling home from youth group without bike lights. Because my dad was a scientist, it seemed like academia was the way forward – until I found more artistic interests. I started going to concerts and seeing bits of theatre, and realised there was a new way of doing things. To some extent I learned about standup – or rather standing up and being silly – in church. I’m not one of those people who everyone huddles round to listen to in the pub. I met someone I went to primary school with recently and they said: “I remember you – you didn’t say much, but when you did it was quite funny.” That’s pretty much what I do. There’s a saying about acting being the shy man’s revenge, and you could probably apply that to my career. Andy would often come and see my early theatre performances. He’s always had a way of balancing out compliments. I was doing Shakespeare in college and his feedback was: “I thought you were very good, but when you walked across the stage you did it like a footballer.” Recently I went on Richard Osman’s House of Games – I thought I was a quizzy sort of person, but I came last. I told Andy that and he just started laughing. It’s quite handy when someone loves you and laughs at you, and I’d do the same to him. I’m very proud of the way Andy has turned out: he’s presentable, charming and coherent. He’s become himself in spite of growing up in a family of introverts. He can make me laugh like no other, and I’d like to think that I’ve brought him some joy, too. This was a very formal old sitting room in the heart of Belfast before the Troubles started. A few years later we were visiting when the whole thing kicked off and we got stuck at our grandparents’ for two weeks: we saw fires going off, and Milton and I were fascinated. It was a bit frightening, but quickly became normal. Milton was an amazing big brother. He was really kind, and quite shy, to the point where he didn’t go into a newsagent to buy sweets. Instead he’d stand outside and point at what he wanted. We went to the same school, but because we were so different it was only in the last year our headmaster put together the fact we were related. We always got on growing up, but would occasionally torment each other. I remember making a dog-food sandwich and taking it to school for him. He picked it up and then, to my horror, ate it. He soon got his revenge. Mum would put chocolate desserts in the freezer so they would keep longer. Milton took a container, filled it with water, and put it back in the freezer. The next day I took it to school and by break my lunch box was swimming with water, with a note in it that said: “Haha.” I find it painful to see Milton perform, and my wife will often ask why I’m not laughing. But it’s just not relaxing for me. He’s always funny, but I get too nervous, wanting him to succeed. Before he won the Perrier award, he’d considered giving up, but Milton had a real gift. As well as talent, you’ve got to be a bit lucky and determined to go to small pubs around the country with audiences giving you grief – and he persisted. Our parents didn’t want him to go in the comedy direction – they thought it would be a one-way ticket to not doing much – then suddenly he did really well. They were unbelievably proud of him. Dad died about five years ago, and the hardest thing now is that our mum is in a home with Alzheimer’s. Milton has been incredible – he takes most of the brunt of looking after her. He is the most patient person ever and relentlessly giving. You could see those qualities when he was young – he’s got a heart of gold.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Milton Jones looks back: ‘I remember making a dog-food sandwich and taking it to school for him’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/02/milton-jones-looks-back-brother-dog-food-sandwich
4/2/2022," The South African soprano Golda Schultz won an instant following after her appearance at the Last Night of the Proms in the lockdown-truncated 2020 season. Despite the oddness of the event, she handled it joyfully and graciously. Her new album with pianist Jonathan Ware, This Be Her Verse (Alpha Classics), confirms her versatility and musical intelligence. The recital consists of songs by five female composers, from the romantics Emilie Mayer (1812-1883) and Clara Schumann (1819-1896), to the mid-century adventurers, Rebecca Clarke (1886-1979) and Nadia Boulanger (1887-1979) to the present: the South African composer-pianist Kathleen Tagg (b. 1977). Schultz and Ware rise to the challenge of every style, from Mayer’s urgent Der Erlkönig to Clarke’s wistful Down by the Salley Gardens. The album’s title is from a new song cycle by Tagg, to texts by Lila Palmer. Commissioned by Schultz, they are deft, upbeat, sharp and true, a celebration of the single bed and clean sheets.  Chromatic and disturbing, Alexander Scriabin’s single-movement Piano Sonata No 9 Op 68 (1913) soon acquired the nickname “Black Mass”. (He didn’t object, having already named his seventh sonata “White Mass”.) The American pianist Orion Weiss has included this mesmerising work in Arc I (First Hand Records), the first of three albums relating to the prelude and aftermath of the first and second world wars. The opening work is Granados’s ambitious Goyescas Op 11 (1911). Weiss makes light of these six fiercely difficult movements about love and death, built on scraps of ideas shaped into complex and poetic material. In contrast, Janáček’s In the Mists (1912), a cycle of four short pieces, is spare and compact, inward looking, steeped in folk melody, unpredictable. “More like entries in a wild diary than character pieces”, as Weiss writes. The Scriabin, with its feral threats and spectres, concludes this rich and thought-provoking album. Arc II, now keenly awaited, promises Ravel, Shostakovich and Brahms.  Ideal lunchtime listening this coming week: four recitals from the Belfast Music Society international festival of chamber music 2022 recorded at the Great Hall, Queen’s University. This year’s performers include the Trio Gaspard from Berlin and Ukrainian pianist Vadym Kholodenko.

4/2/2022,"Before the pandemic, Edwin, a 59-year-old retired nurse, was just about getting by. His home in Northfield, an outer suburb of Birmingham, was “in chaos”, so crowded with stuff that he could only really use one room. He’d go to the local supermarket for a sandwich, sit in the library for warmth, or the pub for social interaction. It wasn’t great, but it worked for him. And then, in March 2020, the nation went into lockdown. Edwin’s neighbour noticed that he was struggling and alerted a local support scheme that had leafleted the area. What started with food parcel deliveries soon uncovered deeper problems: Edwin hadn’t had gas or electricity for years and his home was unmanageably cluttered. He hadn’t been coping for a long time. Edwin is part of an invisible society who, during the pandemic, were pushed from barely surviving to rapidly struggling. Living in isolation, many people in this situation are hanging on by a thread, never seeking or asking for help. Edwin and others like him might be in their 50s and early 60s. Still of working age, they don’t fit the category of “elderly”, at which point support such as a pension or state care – however minimal – might kick in. Now, with the cost of living crisis set to plunge swaths of our society into poverty, the worry is that growing numbers in this age range may be pushed into this state of decline, out of sight and with no safety net to catch them. During a recent visit to Birmingham, I met Lisa Robinson at Northfield Community Partnership (NCP), a community charity that set up a network of local pandemic volunteers. This team of 80 “street champions” started checking on local residents when the first lockdown came into force. Its volunteers kept encountering people “who had fallen through the cracks, often in their own properties”, said Robinson. People like Edwin could find themselves in this situation for a variety of reasons: the cumulative result of years of economic hardship; long-term isolation; perhaps a health incident that set off a downward spiral. Robinson tells me of an intelligent, articulate 60-year-old woman, Jane, who, with years of fulfilling employment ahead of her, had a stroke at the age of 50 and gave up on life. Before NCP stepped in to help, she had barely left her house in months. Members of this demographic might be wary of visiting officials, perhaps fearful of having their lives ordered by others or their independence taken away, or scarred after previous, unhelpful interactions. Austerity policies didn’t just cut budgets, they also severed people’s relationship with the welfare state. As a result, many people no longer even believe that state support is available to them. As the Birmingham Street Champions set to work, providing people like Edwin and Jane with pathways back into the communities around them, progress was slow. Volunteers with the Street Champions scheme would visit people’s homes, snatching conversations through a crack in the door that would gradually widen with each visit. Street Champions is just one example of mutual aid that took many forms during the pandemic: neighbourhood WhatsApp groups, local Labour groups, even a furloughed theatre company. In Birmingham, NCP was set up in 2007 to provide community support after the closure of MG Rover’s car manufacturing plant in nearby Longbridge. It caused 6,000 direct redundancies and devastated the region’s manufacturing sector, precipitating a sharp economic decline. When the pandemic arrived, NCP was ready to tap into its community network and spring into action. In Northfield, Edwin is doing well. He was supported by Clouds End, a social enterprise that works with people with hoarding issues. NCP cleared Edwin’s garden and home, and his power was reconnected. He was furnished with a donated cooker, fridge and washing machine, the basics that so many of us rely on, which he had been living without for years. Recently, Edwin returned to nursing work. Having previously felt “like a non-entity, like nothing”, he now enjoys stability and purpose. Across the country, mutual aid is reconnecting the threads that run through Britain’s societies. In Northbridge, Birmingham, I met Ryan Treasure, 26, and Ryan Ohare, 22, both part of a street-dance crew and volunteers for the NCP food bank in a local community centre, Allens Cross, during the worst lockdown months. Treasure still volunteers with other food banks, while Ohare, who used the community centre as a child, is now employed as its caretaker. Both enthuse about working with older people – they say they know so much and can be a source of advice. The pair have grown accustomed to negative assumptions being made of them. Treasure, who has experienced racist bullying at school and racial profiling on the streets, says: “People think we can’t make it, we can’t do this, can’t do that. But we care about our community, the people around us who supported us. If we can give back in any way, we will.” It’s a sharp contrast to the frequent depictions of young people as hopeless, self-absorbed snowflakes that often dominate the media. But then, Britain’s mutual aid organising blew apart so many of the polarised, mean-spirited and zero-sum portrayals of society that have shaped our political conversation in recent years. For the many who volunteered nationwide, mutual aid was a moment of showing solidarity with the whole community and choosing to be an active part of it. The incredible number of people who volunteered across the country (and continue to do so) reflects a desire for purpose and action, meaning and connection. For people like Edwin and thousands of others, it was a lifeline. Rachel Shabi is a journalist and broadcaster",Opinion/Opinion,Mutual aid was a vital safety net during Covid.

4/2/2022,"Cressida Dick’s tenure as the Metropolitan police commissioner will come to a close at the end of next week, the Mayor of London’s office has said. Dick will leave the post on Sunday 10 April, after her final day in the post she has held for five years was agreed by the Mayor’s Office for Police and Crime along with the terms of departure. The home secretary, Priti Patel, had announced earlier in the week that her tenure would end sometime in April. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, will work with Patel to appoint Dick’s replacement. The new commissioner is expected to “address the deep cultural issues facing the Met police service”, the mayor’s office said. Dick’s deputy, Sir Stephen House, will serve temporarily as acting commissioner. There is expected to be a period of months before a new commissioner is found. A spokesperson for the mayor of London said: “The mayor thanks Dame Cressida Dick for her decades of public service. The mayor has been clear that candidates for the next commissioner must have a plan to restore the trust and confidence of Londoners.” Dick resigned last month after she was unable to convince Khan she could reform the force and was unwilling to attend a meeting to discuss with the mayor why he thought her plans were inadequate. In a tweet, Dick said: “My last working day as Met commissioner will be April 10. It has been a tremendous honour to serve the people of London and the UK. “I will share more on the work of my brave officers and staff next week.” More to follow …",News/UK news,"Cressida Dick to leave Met police post next week, says Sadiq Khan",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/02/cressida-dick-to-leave-met-police-post-next-week-says-sadiq-khan
4/2/2022,"Last week, as the sun set over the craggy hills of Spitzkoppe, Namibia, Edith Lemay and her husband, Sébastien Pelletier, stared out over the vast landscape. The Canadian couple and their four children had spent the day scaling boulders, then cooled off from the desert heat in a nearby rock pool. “There was a sweetness hanging in the air and as the sun disappeared, it gave way to more stars than we’ve ever seen in our lives,” said Lemay. “It was just … magic.” Their children, Mia, Leo, Colin and Laurent also gazed at the deep, inky darkness of the sky, awestruck. Three of those children will lose their eyesight in the coming years, making the experience all the more important for Lemay and Pelletier, who plan to travel for the next year to give the kids as many visually rich experiences as they can. “I want their heads to be full of beautiful landscapes that they can remember years from now,” she said. Mia, 11, Colin, six, and Laurent, four, were recently diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a rare degenerative disorder whereby the cells of the retina gradually break down. The loss of vision is expected to accelerate in the coming years, probably leaving them only a narrow sliver of sight by their 30s or 40s. “There’s no cure,” said Lemay. “So it’s a waiting game and there’s nothing we can do.” Even though neither parent has blindness in their immediate family, both are carriers of recessive genetic mutation responsible for retinitis pigmentosa. Lemay and Pelletier’s firstborn, Mia, was diagnosed with the disorder after she had difficulty seeing objects at night, a hallmark sign. Colin and Laurent also had trouble seeing objects at night as infants, but Leo hasn’t been tested because he shows no problems with his vision. As they digested the news that three of their children would become blind, the family initially tried to get Mia to learn braille. But in a cruel irony, her eyesight at the time was too strong. Still, knowing that her vision would deteriorate, a specialist at the school suggested immersing the children in rich, detailed scenes. “She said to show them giraffes and elephants. She meant books, but we figured why not just see the real thing?” said Lemay. “We’ve travelled with them before and they’re great on the road.” Lemay, who works as a project manager, and Pelletier, who works in finance, had once dreamed of such a trip and had been saving for years to make it happen. The family flew from Montreal, Quebec, nearly two weeks ago after their initial plans for a globe-spanning trip were delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Already, they have camped in the desert, sand-boarded and spotted Cape fur seals basking on the Atlantic coast. After Namibia, they plan to travel the 1,100-mile Tazara railway from Zambia to Tanzania, where they will finally get the chance to see the big game animals most North American children only see in books. If geopolitical tensions ease, they could be in Turkey and then Mongolia by late summer. Lemay says she’s taken as many pictures as possible to ensure even when her children have lost most of their sight, they still have something to look back on. “Maybe they’ll be able to look at the photographs and the pictures will bring back those stories, those memories, of the family together.” The trip, like any foray into a new place, has also proven exhausting, as the parents juggle logistics, planning with the realities of homeschooling four children on the road. Lemay and Pelletier are documenting their travels, and occasional frustrations, on their page Le monde plein leurs yeux. Despite moments of friction, brought on by hunger, tiredness or the realities of corralling four energetic youth, Lemay says the trip has already left her with the memories she had hoped for. Earlier in the day, as they drove along the western coastline of the sub-Saharan nation, the family stopped to visit a famous shipwreck. “They just asked to dip their toes in the ocean,” said Lemay. “But with kids, it’s never just the toes. Five minutes later they’re soaking wet and soon there’s sand and water in the car. But they’re just so excited.”",News/World news,Canada family tour world to store rich memories before children go blind,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/canada-family-tour-children-blindness
