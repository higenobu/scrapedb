4/27/2022,"By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan has prepared an emergency relief package worth $103 billion to cushion the economic blow from rising raw material costs, and plans further steps later this year to promote long-term reforms, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Tuesday. Kishida is under pressure to ramp up fiscal spending ahead of an upper house election scheduled to take place in July, putting Japan out of sync with many Western economies that are gradually phasing out crisis-mode stimulus measures. The 13.2-trillion-yen ($103 billion) relief package, to be funded mostly by reserves set aside under the current fiscal year's budget, will consist of steps to deal with the immediate hit from rising prices such as subsidies to gasoline wholesalers and cash payouts to low-income households with children. Of the total, direct government spending will amount to 6.2 trillion yen. The rest consists of non-direct spending measures such as private-sector lending. The government will compile an extra budget and pass it through the current parliament session to replenish reserves and secure funds to deal with any resurgence in COVID-19 infections or prolonged rises in fuel costs, Kishida said. ""We must prevent rising fuel and raw material costs from disrupting a recovery in economic and social activity from the pandemic,"" Kishida told a news conference. Aside from the relief package, the government will lay out after the upper house election a ""comprehensive"" package of measures to spear-head change in Japan's society, Kishida said. The package will include steps to help Japan achieve a carbon-neutral society and measures to promote the administration's economic policy focusing on wealth re-distribution, Kishida said, without providing details. ""We need to act pre-emptively looking at the medium- to long-term horizon,"" he said. Analysts expect the government to compile a second extra budget later this year to fund additional spending measures, which could well exceed the size of spending for the relief package announced on Tuesday. ""The government will likely compile a second extra budget in autumn or later this year,"" said Chotaro Morita, chief bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. Given the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) coalition ally, the Komeito party, has demanded an extra budget of up to 20 trillion yen, the second round of spending could be a little short of 20 trillion yen involving additional debt, he said. That could further strain Japan's borrowings, the industrial world's heaviest public debt, at more than twice the size of its $5 trillion economy.

4/27/2022,"(Note: Some images in this story may offend or disturb.) By Anthony Deutsch (Reuters) - Three Russian pilots suspected of bombing civilian buildings in the Kharkiv and Sumy regions are among at least seven Russian military personnel that Kyiv is preparing war crimes charges against, the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office told Reuters. It said the other individuals include two operators of a rocket launcher who allegedly shelled settlements in the Kharkiv region and two army servicemen suspected of murdering a Kyiv area resident and raping his wife. The prosecutor’s office said it had notified the individuals that they are suspects and the investigations are ongoing, adding no charges had been filed with the court. It didn’t name the suspects or provide evidence to support the allegations. It said some of the suspects were held as captives, without specifying where, while other charges were being prepared in absentia. Ukraine says it is investigating some 7,600 potential war crimes and at least 500 suspects following Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of its neighbour. Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told Reuters that many of those suspects are in Russia but some have been taken captive by Ukraine as prisoners of war. Speaking in an interview earlier this month, she said that her office intends to follow the chain of command up the Russian political and military hierarchy. Venediktova added that she plans to pursue prosecutions both in Ukrainian courts as well as at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, the world’s permanent war crimes tribunal. The Kremlin and Russia’s defence ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment. Moscow has rejected allegations by Ukraine and Western nations of war crimes and has denied targeting civilians in what the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise its neighbour. Ukraine’s probe is at the centre of multiple efforts to investigate potential war crimes related to the conflict, including by the ICC. The probes are at the very early stages, people familiar with them say. The ICC has sent an advance team to the region to establish operations. Moscow has accused Kyiv of genocide against Russian speakers, which Kyiv strongly denies. Russia has also opened criminal cases into Ukrainian servicemen's alleged torture of their Russian counterparts. Ukraine, which is conducting its investigation while still in the throes of war, is scrambling to assemble teams of specialists with war crimes expertise, evaluating potential crimes and developing its prosecution strategy. ”You can see they are now exhuming the bodies, so [the investigation is at a] very early stage,"" a person familiar with the process said. In terms of strategy, Kyiv plans to prosecute as much as it can in Ukrainian courts but would likely leave any cases involving higher-ranking figures to the ICC, the person added. The UN has also established its own inquiry into possible violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine, including possible war crimes, which could feed into any prosecutions by the ICC. There is also a European Union-coordinated effort to fast track sharing of evidence between various investigating authorities, including with the ICC. Several European countries have said they will apply universal jurisdiction, the legal principle that some crimes are so terrible they can be heard by foreign national courts, and their prosecutors could launch investigations into Ukrainian atrocities. For Ukraine, the immediate challenge is the sheer volume of potential evidence and witness testimony that needs to be secured and recorded in a way that is usable in court, legal specialists say. That includes vast amounts of digital imagery as well as material gathered on the ground. David Schwendiman, a former U.S. federal prosecutor who has also helped prosecute war crimes committed during the Balkan wars in the 1990s, praised Ukraine’s prosecutor general as talented and courageous but said the country doesn’t have experience of an investigation of this scale and will need outside help processing potential crime scenes in a way that meets international standards. “Every one of those bodies is a crime scene. Every one of those buildings is a crime scene. Every city is a crime scene,” Schwendiman said. Something as small as a piece of cloth torn from a uniform, an ammunition shell or even a ligature used to tie someone’s hands could help identify a particular unit involved and so needs to be carefully preserved, he added. Zera Kozlyieva, deputy head of the war crimes unit in the prosecutor general’s office, acknowledged that limited access due to ongoing hostilities and a shortage of war crimes specialists presented challenges. Speaking Thursday on a panel at international affairs think tank Chatham House, she said that Kyiv is seeking help from international experts. WAR CRIMES ALLEGATIONS Images of dead civilians in Ukraine, including of mass graves and bodies of bound civilians shot at close range, have prompted international outrage, with U.S. President Joe Biden calling for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be investigated for war crimes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused invading Russian troops of committing ""the most terrible war crimes"" since World War Two. According to the United Nations, as of April 22 more than 2,400 civilians had been killed since the conflict began in late February. But the official count is likely to climb. In the port city of Mariupol alone, local authorities have said thousands of people have been killed. Under international law, war crimes include intentionally targeting civilian populations, willfully killing or causing suffering, and widespread destruction among other serious violations of laws applicable in armed conflict. Individuals who commit such crimes can be prosecuted by international tribunals such as the ICC and by states. Experts for the Organization for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) nations said in a report published earlier this month that they found evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia in Ukraine. The experts also said in the report that they’d found evidence of violations of international humanitarian law by Ukraine, particularly in its treatment of prisoners of war, but that Russia's violations ""are by far larger in nature and scale."" Ukraine has said it checks all information regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, will investigate any violations and take appropriate legal action. Russia has said the report ""is based solely on unfounded propaganda theses, contains references to dubious sources and logical stretches in the style of 'highly likely.'"" UKRAINE’S PROBE The prosecutor general’s office had in recent years established a special unit to investigate potential crimes in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 but Kyiv continues to claim as part of Ukraine, and Donbas. Moscow’s February invasion of its Western neighbour forced Kyiv to scale up what had been a relatively small team of prosecutors. Venediktova and her team have in recent weeks been evaluating sites where atrocities have taken place, including where Russian troops have recently withdrawn. On April 12, Venediktova visited Bucha, near Kyiv, where French forensic experts had arrived to help Ukraine authorities establish what happened in the town where hundreds of bodies have been discovered. As the group from the French Gendarmerie's forensic science department looked on, workers in hazmat suits dug earth from a shallow grave and lifted out a heavy mass wrapped in an orange blanket. Citing witnesses, Venediktova said during the visit that the burnt body parts inside were those of a woman and her two children. Russia has said that images and footage of dead bodies strewn across Bucha were fake. Venediktova is also drawing on international legal expertise and seeking technical assistance. She has announced the formation of a task force of law firms and prominent international human rights lawyers, including Amal Clooney, to advise on securing accountability for Ukrainian victims in national jurisdictions as well as strategic guidance on cooperating with the ICC. Venediktova is in regular contact with Beth Van Schaack, Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice in the U.S. State Department, who said the two have discussed what additional assistance Washington could provide. Van Schaack’s office has been helping to deploy specialists on the ground via a joint U.S.-European project. Van Schaack told Reuters that Venediktova’s requests for assistance include forensics expertise, such as helping determine how victims found in mass graves died and whether potential signs of torture were inflicted prior to death. Other requests include help identifying the type and origins of particular ballistics used as well as assistance clearing any mines left by Russians so that her investigators can safely access those areas. Ukraine’s potentially biggest challenge, said Van Schaack, will be gaining custody of suspects, particularly those higher up the command chain. If they remain in Russia, they may “enjoy impunity for the rest of their days,” she said.

4/27/2022,"The FBI seized several items in October 2021 raids on a Russian oligarch's mansions, Bloomberg reported. Among the items were Prada shoes, fine artworks, and hiking boots, Bloomberg said. The oligarch in question, Oleg Deripaska, was sanctioned by the US in 2018. FBI agents seized items including Prada shoes, sunglasses, and six fine artworks when they raided New York and Washington mansions linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, Bloomberg reported Monday. Deripaska, a billionaire industrialist who cofounded aluminum giant Rusal, was sanctioned by the US in 2018 after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea territory in 2014. Deripaska is accused by the US of breaches of money laundering laws and threatening the lives of business rivals. In October 2021, the FBI raided New York and Washington, DC mansions linked to Deripaska, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous people familiar with the matter. Also among the items seized by agents were hiking boots and homewares, as well as financial and telephone records, the people told Bloomberg. The raids appear to be linked to concerns among US authorities that Deripaska has tried to evade US sanctions, Bloomberg said. Deripaska's spokesperson dismissed the claims, saying they were ""lies and baseless allegations."" They told Bloomberg: ""To think that seizing baseball caps and shoes in houses that do not even belong to Mr Deripaska will somehow make those lies more believable is absurd."" Deripaska sued to lift the US sanctions after they ""devastated"" his wealth and reputation, The Wall Street Journal reported. A US court rejected his appeal in March 2022, saying his reasoning that the sanctions were unlawful lacked merit, court documents showed. After Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Deripaska was sanctioned by the UK, on March 10, and by Australia, on March 18, over what officials said were his links to Putin and the Kremlin. Deripaska has spoken out against what Russia has called a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

4/27/2022,"Former President Donald Trump has baselessly blamed a ""rigged election"" in the US for the war in Ukraine. ""It's a shame all those people are dead,"" Trump said, referring to the conflict's casualties. ""Because if our election wasn't rigged, you would've had nobody dead,"" he added. Former President Donald Trump has again touted baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen, this time blaming the ""rigged election"" for the number of war dead in Ukraine. ""It's a shame all those people are dead, all because of a rigged election,"" said Trump during an interview with British TV host Piers Morgan that aired on Monday. ""Because if our election wasn't rigged, you would've had nobody dead."" He told Morgan that he thought the conflict was a ""stupid war"" and a ""horrible waste."" ""Far more people are dead than you think,"" Trump noted. The former president agreed with Morgan's assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin is an ""evil, genocidal monster."" Trump also lamented that Ukraine was a ""country that was working"" despite having ""lots of problems."" ""And people were happy. I guess a lot of them were happy because they're certainly fighting for it,"" he said. Trump also insisted to Morgan that, during his time in office, he had warned Putin of the ""strong response"" that awaited should Russia invade Ukraine. However, he refused to comment if he told Putin that he would be ready to use the US's nuclear capabilities. Asked by Morgan about what he would do in Ukraine if he were president, Trump said he would emphasize that the US has ""better weapons"" than Russia. ""I would say, 'We have far more than you do, far more powerful than you, and you can't use that word ever again. You cannot use the nuclear word ever again. And if you do, we're gonna have problems,'"" he added. Despite Trump's claims, there has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. In March, he insisted that no one else could talk to Putin but him and suggested that the US send its nuclear submarines to ply the Russian coast to put pressure on Putin. The former president has also been slammed by various parties — including veteran diplomats — for praising Putin and describing the Russian leader's reason for invading Ukraine as ""savvy"" and ""genius.""

4/27/2022,"By the time the alpacas arrive outside the Fairfax County Courthouse, it's not really that surprising. Andrea Diaz of Lorton, Va., is a Johnny Depp fan who has been watching his defamation trial against his ex-wife Amber Heard, and thinks it's ""really messed up."" She started a business during the coronavirus pandemic where she brings alpacas to kids' houses to raise their spirits, and wants to do the same for Depp. ""I thought the alpacas might brighten his day,"" Diaz says last Monday, not long before Depp first takes the stand. She acknowledges the Pirates of the Caribbean star - who enters and exits the courthouse each day through a gated back entrance - may not actually see Dolce and Inti, the emotional support alpacas who are gamely posing for photos with passersby. ""But I figured I would just give it a shot."" Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. The scene outside the Depp-Heard trial, entering its third week on Monday, has transformed the Fairfax County court complex from a place where Northern Virginia residents contest parking tickets to the stage for one of the biggest celebrity court cases in recent memory. The area has seen its share of high-profile cases, but a trial involving one of the world's most famous movie stars has brought with it a slight whiff of the surreal. ""Read the news,"" one sheriff's deputy mumbles as the umpteenth observer walks by the ""John C. Depp, II v. Amber Laura Heard"" sign outside the courtroom and wonders out loud why in the world Johnny Depp is in Fairfax. Depp, 58, is suing Heard, 36, for $50 million for defamation over an opinion piece she wrote in The Washington Post in 2018 saying she had become a public figure representing domestic abuse. Though she did not name Depp, she had filed for divorce and a restraining order against him two years prior, alleging he physically assaulted her. Depp has denied all claims of abuse and said the op-ed caused irreparable damage to his career. After his lawyer said Heard's allegations were a hoax, Heard countersued him for $100 million for defamation. The actor's lawyers filed the suit in Virginia because The Post, which is not a defendant in this case, houses its printing press and online server in Fairfax County. Depp and Heard appear in the courtroom every day, not making eye contact and occasionally leaning over to speak to their attorneys. Depp's testimony lasted for more than seven hours over Tuesday and Wednesday before Heard's defense lawyer, Ben Rottenborn, began cross-examination in earnest, taking up all of Thursday. He is scheduled to continue Monday. Depp's appearance on the stand injects an extra flurry of activity into the proceedings. The courtroom fills to near-capacity most days, and Depp's fans tend to murmur and even snicker quietly to themselves when the actor talks back to Rottenborn. (""He's getting sassy,"" one whispers.) The actual legal arguments in Courtroom 5J are as serious and solemn as you would expect from a case that involves allegations of physical abuse from each party - denied by both sides - and an accusation of sexual assault from Heard, which Depp's representative called ""fictitious."" The judge, Penney Azcarate, signed an order banning selfies or autographs. A deputy warns courtroom spectators against laughing loudly, cheering or rolling their eyes. But in a case involving celebrities, the scene is bound to turn intense. And strange. (A Fairfax County public information officer declined a request to make any officials available to discuss how different this is compared with other trials.) Outlets including Court TV and Law & Crime are live-streaming from inside the courtroom, which brought even more curious bystanders out during the second week. News cameras line up outside the front of the courthouse, while photographers stand on ladders near the rear exit to capture Depp or Heard coming and going. The British media has shown up - the Daily Mail, the BBC - in addition to the Associated Press, New York Post, the Independent and more. Nick Wallis, a British journalist, crowdfunded his trip here and is repaying his audience with live-tweeting of the trial as well as a newsletter and YouTube updates. Observers line up well before sunrise to procure one of the 100 brightly colored spectator wristbands that are available starting at 7 a.m. If the wristband looks remotely tampered with, you will not be allowed in. Some spectators are intrigued local residents (""I'm a true-crime nut,"" says one Arlington woman who took the day off work) or college students from the nearby George Mason University. In the trial's first week, one reporter arrived too late to get in the courtroom and offered $50 to one spectator for his wristband. (The offer was scornfully declined.) Although there are some Heard supporters, the loudest presence are Depp loyalists, who have traveled from all over. Jacinta Gillespie of Brisbane, Australia - who was ""very disappointed"" when Depp lost a 2020 libel suit against the U.K.-based Sun after a headline called him a ""wife beater"" - says she took four weeks of vacation to attend. Several carry ""Justice for Johnny"" signs, echoing the social media hashtag. Tiffany Lunn of St. Mary's County, Md., holds a poster that reads ""Wish He Never Heard!!"" with a picture of the actress. Others bring flowers. Some have pirate flags as a nod to Depp's most successful character, Captain Jack Sparrow. They get there early for the good seats. They don't leave the building for lunch, so they can get the same seats after the break. Around 5 p.m., when court adjourns, some fans try to properly time their exits, so they can hustle to the back of the building, where Depp leaves in a black Cadillac Escalade, zooming past the nearby Red Hot & Blue barbecue restaurant as he heads back to his hotel. He will usually wave to them out his window; some days, you can hear screams as the ride passes by, and see the disappointment on the faces of those who didn't make it. A pair of women break into a run up the hill toward Chain Bridge Road to no avail, then strategize about leaving the courtroom earlier the next day. Others revel in their brief fortune: ""I saw him! I saw him! He waved and I screamed, 'Johnny!' "" a woman excitedly reports to someone over FaceTime. Two fans who identify themselves as Arya and Isabelle make it just in time to see Depp's car. ""I've been showing my support online for years, and I had an opportunity to show support in person, and I think that makes a profoundly huge difference,"" Arya says, adding that he started a GoFundMe to raise money to travel to Virginia from Michigan. Isabelle says she arrived from New York and got a job at PetSmart to afford the trip. She earned enough to stay until about May 7, she says, and hopes to return for the last week of the trial, expected to wrap up right before Memorial Day. ""I know a lot of people, especially the mainstream media and movie critics, think what he's doing is so ridiculous and that he needs to move on,"" she says. ""But from my point of view, . . . he shouldn't just move on, because it's important to get the truth out there."" Heard is also expected to take the stand in her defense. The actress, who has starred in films such as ""Aquaman"" and ""Justice League,"" isn't as well-known as her ex-husband. ""I've already forgot the name of the other party,"" one prospective juror admitted during jury selection. Heard has a staunch defender in Christina Taft of Los Angeles, the founder of Worldie, an initiative to use social media for good. Taft has rallied others to show up in defense of the actress, whom she believes is being targeted by nefarious forces online that are amplifying Depp's aggressively vocal fans. She points to a flood of brutal comments directed at the actress on social media, and notes that other people have been driven to drastic measures when they face the same kind of vitriol. ""She's a huge victim of these operations online,"" Taft said. ""And because of them, you can't support her, or anything, because it's very targeted, and most people can't catch that."" By the second week, the county court put tighter security measures in place; deputies started requiring photo IDs and recording the names of everyone who gets a wristband. This may be a result of multiple people being removed from court, including journalist Eve Barlow, a friend of Heard's; Depp's attorneys claimed Barlow was live-tweeting from the courtroom - where no phones are allowed - and showed Heard's lawyer misleading evidence that led to the stricken testimony of one of Depp's witnesses. (A person familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations disputes that Barlow did either of those things.) The New York Post reported that two spectators were kicked out after allegedly making threats against Heard on social media. As the spectacle plays out, other Virginia residents are just trying to go about their business. On a recent afternoon, newlyweds Corey and Kala Bell of Alexandria arrive to pick up their marriage certificate and documents, so Kala can officially change her last name. They ask a video camera operator the reason for all the commotion. He tells them it's for the Johnny Depp trial, and they think he's kidding. Assured it's really happening, they laugh in disbelief. ""We saw the Court TV van, and were like, 'What's going on?' Then I noticed there was a lot of cops,"" Kala says. She assumed it was about another headline-making case. ""I thought maybe it was related to the 'shopping cart killer,' "" Kala says, referring to the man charged with allegedly killing two women in Virginia and transporting their bodies in shopping carts. ""I thought it had to be something about him, honestly.""

4/27/2022,"Rescuers searching since a tour boat carrying 26 people apparently sank off far northeastern Japan have found the body of an 11th victim — a child — as questions intensify about why the vessel sailed in rough weather at a known hazardous location. The child was found late Sunday and later confirmed dead, the Coast Guard said Monday. The bodies of 10 victims — seven men and three women — were found earlier Sunday. The Kazu 1 with two crew was taking 24 passengers, including two children, on a scenic tour at Shiretoko National Park on the northern side of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island, when it sent a distress call Saturday afternoon saying it was sinking. The location was near Kashuni Waterfall, which is known as a difficult place to maneuver boats because of its rocky coastline and strong tide. The Transport Ministry is investigating the boat's operator, Shiretoko Pleasure Cruise, which had two accidents last year, including one that also involved the captain of the sunken boat. The ministry said it was looking into safety standards and the decision to conduct the tour despite rough weather on Saturday. Japanese media reported the Coast Guard was considering a criminal investigation on suspicion of professional negligence. Shiretoko Pleasure Cruise had been instructed to improve its safety following the earlier accidents. In June, a boat ran aground without causing injuries, and in May, a boat collided with an object, causing three passengers to suffer minor injuries. The June accident involved the same captain of the sunken boat. “We will thoroughly investigate what caused this situation and what kind of safety oversight was involved to allow the tour in order to prevent another accident,” Transport Minister Tetsuo Saito, who visited the area Sunday, told reporters. Shiretoko Pleasure Cruise says its three-hour tour offers views of the western coast of the Shiretoko Peninsula and a chance to see whales, dolphins and brown bears. The national park is a UNESCO World Heritage site known as the southernmost region to see drifting sea ice. Average April sea temperatures in the area are just above freezing. Experts say the low temperature and strong wind make the chances of survival low. The bodies recovered Sunday were found in the same area near the tip of the peninsula, about 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) north from where the boat sent a distress call. Some were plucked from the sea, and others were found where they had washed onto the rocky coast. Orange, square lifesaving floats with the boat’s name on them were also found on the rocks, the coast guard said. The coast guard said the operator told them that everyone on the boat was wearing a life vest but some of the victims found were without them. Experts and local fishermen and boat operators also say they believe the boat was likely to have run aground after it was tossed around in high waves and damaged. High waves and strong winds were forecast when the boat left port, and Japanese media said fishing boats had returned to port before noon Saturday because of the bad weather. Local fisheries cooperative head Kazuhiko Fukayama told NHK television that it was unthinkable for the tour to have gone ahead in weather that was so rough passengers would have found it difficult just to stand still. A tour boat crew belonging to another operator told NHK that he warned the Kazu 1 crew of rough seas and told them not to go. He also said the same boat ran aground last year and suffered a crack on its bow. Accounts of local fishermen and tour boat operators suggest Kazu 1 was the only boat in the area, where no other boat was around to help the sinking boat until the first Coast Guard rescuers arrived at the scene from elsewhere on Hokkaido three hours later. Saturday’s tour was reportedly the first by the operator this season, and the accident just before Japan’s Golden Week holidays starting late April could dampen local tourism, which slumped during the pandemic. Japan is still largely closed to foreign visitors. Hokkaido Gov. Naomichi Suzuki told reporters Sunday that he planned to request safety checks by tour operators in the prefecture ahead of the holidays.",World/The Independent,Child's body found after tour boat sank in Japan's far north,https://news.yahoo.com/childs-body-found-tour-boat-020827041.html

4/27/2022,"For years, Republicans had an easy health care talking point: Repeal and replace Obamacare. In 2017, with full control of Washington, the GOP managed nothing of the sort. Three trips to the Supreme Court, all instigated by Republican-engineered legal challenges, have also left the law standing. It might seem that if the GOP wins Congress again in 2022, the party will leave American health care alone. The only visible attempt at a broad agenda for Republican congressional candidates — the 11 Point Plan to Rescue America by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) — includes no mention of health care policy at all. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) proposed last month on a Breitbart News radio interview that Republicans should repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but backtracked just a few days later. The prospect of a Republican resurgence in Congress raises the question: Where does the GOP stand today on health care policy — ACA/Obamacare, Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance and so much more? After a decade of ACA wars, do conservatives and Republicans have anything new to offer?
 For the record, I was a U.S. Senate staffer involved in the crafting and passing the ACA during the law’s legislative process in 2009 and 2010 where I had the opportunity to get to know many of the GOP's serious and thoughtful health care wonks. Recently I reached out to and spoke with conservative and Republican health policy experts to understand their views about potential policy directions if Republicans take over the Senate and/or the House of Representatives next January, and perhaps the White House in 2025. What’s new? What’s left of the great white whale of Obamacare repeal? Do conservatives have fresh and challenging ideas? Are there break-out proposals being prepared or are they just repackaging old wine in new or old bottles? Here’s what I learned. My conversations with analysts, activists, and observers showed zero appetite to take on ACA repeal again. “The Affordable Care Act is now embedded in our health care system,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told the Washington Post in reaction to Johnson’s comments. “There are many improvements that can be made, but I do not foresee Congress repealing it altogether even if [Republicans] take control of Congress.” Collins was one of three Republicans whose 2017 vote against ACA repeal ended that effort. That vote included the late Sen. John McCain’s now famous “thumbs down” decisive gesture against repeal. More recently, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) told an April 11 town hall in Iowa, “I’m saying I would not” vote to repeal the ACA. Dean Clancy of the libertarian Americans for Prosperity grassroots organization told me: “Obamacare is here to stay, but we believe the law needs major improvements to deliver more personalized care for patients. We’ve had success in partially repealing controversial parts.” Among the successes he and other conservatives count include zeroing out the ACA’s Individual Mandate penalty in late 2017, repealing the much-disliked Cadillac Tax on high cost health insurance policies, eliminating the Medical Device Tax and repealing the Independent Payment Advisory Board that could have exercised broad authority to cut Medicare spending in ways that would have enraged hospitals, physicians and insurers. National Review Editor Ramesh Ponnuru sees the elimination of these objectionable provisions as key to understanding today’s lower temperature on ACA repeal. “The most disliked sections that had motivated support for repeal have all been eliminated. The politics of Obamacare changed with the removal of those major pain points.” Respected health policy expert Gail Wilensky of Project HOPE concludes that “the notion of repealing the ACA in 2022 is absurd. If people want to change the coverage aspects, they have to have something in mind to replace it. Otherwise, you can’t do it.” Even conservative guru John Goodman, the father of the Health Savings Account, concludes, “Repeal is off the table.” Joe Antos of the American Enterprise Institute said: “Repeal and Replace will never be spoken of again by an intelligent pol. If 2017 didn’t kill it, then nothing else could.” Dismissal of ACA repeal does not indicate agreement with core ACA policies. The list of remaining objectionable provisions is long and firmly held. Doug Badger, who doubles at the Heritage Foundation and the Galen Institute, offers a list: “Republicans still believe that ACA premiums are too high, networks are too restrictive, and cost-sharing too burdensome. The subsidies are ill conceived, linked strictly to income and detrimental to people with chronic disease. In most states, exchange-based plans have become a poorly functioning risk pool where the sickest get inadequate coverage that denies them access to the best care. While Democrats hope to keep the system going with more and more federal subsidies, the coverage is still bad, and now even people with six-figure incomes don’t have to pay full price.” Democrats recognized that the law’s subsidies to make health insurance premiums affordable were inadequate for many. They had hoped that the ACA would be amended to address this weakness prior to full implementation in 2014. Instead, that improvement happened in 2021 as part of President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act; major premium subsidy increases were included in the act, though only for 2021 and 2022 and with zero Republican support in either the House or the Senate. Biden’s currently stalled Build Back Better legislation, if enacted, would add another three years of enhanced subsidies through 2025, something no conservative health policy expert with whom I spoke is willing to endorse. Instead, conservatives prioritize changing the ACA and other federal laws to permit more consumer choices to purchase lower cost — and lower value — insurance plans with fewer guaranteed benefits or coverage protections. This is where conservatives are rolling out their agendas and putting stakes in the ground. Policy thinker Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, gets right to the point: “A big mistake of folks on the right is saying that the status quo with employer-sponsored health insurance is just fine. [Such coverage] in its current format has proven incapable of controlling costs and negotiating on behalf of workers. And employers are getting fed up with it, too.” Roy has his own plan — to offer workers at startup companies the monetary value of their employer insurance including the federal tax deduction to let them choose health insurance on their own, a plan he calls the Fair Care Act. He also advocates a broad alternative called “Medicare Advantage for All,” which would use Medicare’s private health insurance option known as Part C as a national reform model. Goodman, whose National Center for Policy Analysis is now known as the Goodman Institute, is advancing his own “Pro-Patient, Pro-Family Health Reform” plan in partnership with other conservative think tanks including the Heritage Foundation and the Galen Institute. Their 10-point plan, similar in many respects to Roy’s, would end narrow-provider networks, discourage high deductibles and high premiums, give workers access to personal health insurance and lots more. If Goodman’s agenda sounds populist, that’s by design. In a March 2022 brief analysis, he advises “How Politicians Should Talk about Health Care.” Rule number 1 is “Talk about benefits, not about how benefits are created.” In a back-handed compliment and knock on Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), he observes: “Bernie Sanders is a master at this. Everyone who hears ‘Medicare for All’ immediately thinks they will get first rate care, mainly paid for by someone else. Sanders rarely makes the mistake of talking about how we would get 156 million people from an employer plan to a Medicare-for-all plan or who would pay the taxes to fund all of that.” Some conservative policy planks are old hat — for example, association health plans that permit smaller businesses to band together to buy health insurance, and short-term insurance plans that allow the sale of individual policies that leave out guaranteed ACA benefits as well as protections against preexisting condition exclusions. A new model — the Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA — pronounced “ik-rah”) — allows businesses to give tax preferred money to their workers to buy coverage on their own, not through their employers. Though no public data is yet available on the spread of ICHRAs since the Trump Administration established this option in 2019, enthusiasm for it in conservative circles resembles the excitement that greeted Health Savings Accounts in the early 2000s. So it doesn’t take a lot of effort to observe an active health policy ecosystem on the right that is busy recycling and developing ideas that would influence the direction of health policy in a future Republican-dominated federal government. Most of their attention focuses on the employer and individual commercial health insurance markets and the federal-state “marketplaces/exchanges” — the ACA-created entities where individuals and small employers can buy health insurance, ironically a model adapted by Democrats from a Heritage Foundation idea pioneered in the 1990s and early 2000s. The result would be a system with more options and fewer guarantees. Giving employees less money to cover slimmed-down health insurance will lead many workers to forego coverage entirely. Are conservative politicians prepared to look the other way when they develop serious diseases and have no way to pay for care? The two behemoths of federal health policy, Medicare for senior citizens and many disabled, and Medicaid for low-income households of every variety, are far less the reform target of Republicans and conservatives than they used to be. An essential reason for this is that both programs, with little controversy, have become increasingly privatized. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan’s vision of privatizing both programs is happening and fast. Today, about half of all Medicaid spending goes to private Medicaid managed care organizations, most of them for-profit. Trends now project that by 2023 a majority of Medicare’s senior and disabled enrollees will get their coverage via Medicare Advantage (Part C), the private insurance option dominated by massive for-profit insurers such as UnitedHealthcare. The penetration of commercial insurance into both programs is a double-edged sword for conservatives because these for-profit insurer giants oppose conservative policy proposals that would threaten their revenues, such as the Trump Administration’s unsuccessful 2017 proposal to repeal the ACA and provide Medicaid financing to states in block grants rather than reimbursements. It is more challenging for Republicans to delegitimize a program that is privately administered — and championed — by for-profit organizations. Ironically, today’s coverage advocates have powerful, wealthy allies to oppose cuts that could harm Medicaid and Medicare enrollees. As a result, many conservative reform proposals for Medicaid are small-ball, such as redetermining enrollment eligibility annually. Imposing work requirements on categories of Medicaid enrollees — a Trump Administration priority — still holds their support, though nothing will happen on this until Republicans retake the White House. At about 83 million enrollees, Medicaid and its cousin, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, now cover 25 percent of the U.S. population. Twelve states still refuse to expand their Medicaid programs to all their low-income citizens as permitted under the ACA, though made optional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012. Five red states expanded in the past four years, though only because their voters demanded it via ballot initiatives (Idaho, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Utah). Three of the remaining 12 — Florida, Georgia and Texas — have the lion’s share of 2-3 million low-income Americans who can’t get any coverage because of state resistance. No conservative experts with whom I spoke would openly disagree with the holdout states. Under Biden’s stalled BBB legislation, the federal government would open up insurance exchanges in the 12 states to all low-income households for three years. Medicare currently enrolls 64 million Americans, growing daily, and is a big success story for the American right as more than half of new enrollees are signing up daily for the privatized Medicare Advantage option with its lower premiums, lower cost sharing and additional benefits relative to traditional Medicare Parts A and B. Conservatives such as Goodman and Clancy would like to expedite the transition, allowing year-round open enrollment in Part C (as opposed to the current 6-week annual open enrollment period) and even making it the default selection for new enrollees. They would also like to enable Medicare enrollees to obtain and use Health Savings Accounts. But all is not a bed of roses for Part C. In March, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission released an annual report that estimates $12 billion in excess payments to Medicare Advantage plans, opining that “a major overhaul in Medicare Advantage policies is therefore urgently needed.” Going back to its roots in the 1970s, the program had always been intended to lower costs and improve quality relative to enrollees in Traditional Medicare. Writes the advisory commission, “…private plans in the aggregate have never produced savings for Medicare.” Conservatives I spoke with see ingrained bias against Medicare Advantage and criticize the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for not addressing inappropriate overspending. Indeed, a small and growing chorus of voices now suggest that Medicare Advantage could be the foundation for a unitary and reformed national health system, not Sanders’ “Medicare for All” which would eliminate Part C, but “Medicare Advantage for All” that would eliminate Medicare A and B, and make Part C universal. Only lightly discussed by Republicans and Democrats is the looming financial shortfall in the Medicare Part A Hospital Insurance Trust Fund beginning in 2026. Both parties are avoiding the financial headwinds, thus setting the stage for a Medicare financial crisis in 2025. Advocates from both sides are promoting ways to increase program costs rather than restrain them. On the red-hot issue of prescription drug costs, Roy notes “there are two wings in the GOP. What we might call the pro-big-business wing supports the pharmaceutical industry’s position that high drug prices are necessary to support innovation. The growing populist wing, led by Trump, believes that it is important to confront monopoly pricing power on behalf of consumers.” The political center of gravity, for now, tenuously supports new protections for elderly consumers in Medicare Part D, modest changes to patent laws, and that’s about it. Over the past decade, with the advent of “accountable care” and “value-based care” models emanating from the ACA that seek to reorient American health care financing by rewarding quality over quantity of services delivered, growing interest is evident to address “social determinants of health.” These efforts explore ways to address social problems such as poor housing and nutrition as causal factors for illness and disease. Research and policy development have advanced understanding, notably in California where the federal government now is allowing the state to use Medicaid funds — in limited contexts — to address social determinants as a way to lower spending and to improve quality and health. While these developments are spreading rapidly across the health industry and policy sectors, spotting Republicans and conservatives who take this challenge seriously is hard to find. One exception is Stuart Butler, formerly of the Heritage Foundation and now at the Brookings Institution and who became estranged from the right related to his promotion of an individual health insurance mandate over several decades starting in the late 1980s. For the past seven years, Butler has been researching and writing from Brookings about new ideas and directions using social determinants of health. Asked to identify his conservative allies on this front, he was unable to name any. Asked about the growing focus on health inequities and disparities, Republican and conservative experts with whom I consulted were non-committal or openly dismissive. Said Clancy: “Rather than focusing on health care from a group perspective, we focus on improving health care from an individual perspective. We believe that’s how health care should be viewed.” In sum, conservative and Republican health policy voices, in spite of a full retreat on ACA repeal, are active and ambitious to reengage if and when Republicans retake the Senate and/or the House. This is especially true regarding private commercial health insurance, inside or outside of the ACA’s health marketplace/exchanges. They are ready to confront any and all threats to the growing hegemony of Medicare Advantage and to find new opportunities to expand it. They stand on the sidelines regarding fast-growing interest in health care equity and social determinants of health. They are down for the current moment and will be back with ideas and plans when the political climate changes. If prior history matters, so will their emerging ideas.",Politics/Politico,Republicans Have Stopped Trying to Kill Obamacare.

4/27/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of elderly Ukrainians are trapped in the east of the country, unable or unwilling to leave, as Russian forces bear down on their towns, a top humanitarian official has warned. While the plight of children and mothers leaving areas in the east and heading to towns in the west of the country, or nations such as Poland, has received widespread media attention, the dangers facing the elderly have been largely overlooked, says Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). Egeland says many of these people aged in their 70s and 80s, have disabilities or else are bedridden. In some communities in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is now focusing its military operation, elderly people account for as much as 60 per cent of the population. Ukraine news – live: Putin investigates cause of Bryansk oil depot fire It is is a reverse of the situation in crises in places such as Syria and Afghanistan, where there are large numbers of children caught up in the conflict. “I mean, the senselessness of having a war waged among hundreds of thousands of freezing, miserable pensioners,” Egeland tells The Independent from Kyiv, where he is on fact-finding mission. “You cannot make it up.” Egeland, 64, a Norwegian diplomat who previously served as the United Nations Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, says prior to the invasion he travelled to communities in the Donbas, including those under the control of pro-Russian separatists. He says they are people “who had few means, who lived in towns and villages that were devastated by the previous war (that happened in 2014), and now were sitting there, waiting for the new war”. “I ask them again and again, should you leave – can you leave?” He adds: “Uniformly, they say we cannot leave, we have no place to go. This is our land. We will stay come whatever.” Egeland and other aid officials say that more than five million people have now left Ukraine, and a further seven million displaced internally. He says while some have said it is the largest refugee crisis in terms of numbers and timescale since the end of World War II, he cannot think of any precedent in history. “When did we ever see two million people per week be displaced for six weeks, meaning twelve million people. I don’t think it’s happened before,” he says. “It’s a sign of the ferocity of the attacks, and it’s also a sign that the population is mobile and that many families could move children and mothers to places in western Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. It really means the whole country was turned upside down in weeks.” Egeland’s warning about the plight of the forgotten elderly comes as Ukraine marks two months since it was invaded by Russian troops, in what Russian leader Vladimir Putin described as a “special military operation”. Thousands of people have been killed, and there is widespread evidence of what investigators on the ground say are war crimes committed by Russian forces. Moscow has denied such claims and alleged – without evidence – that any such atrocities were staged by Ukrainian forces. At the weekend, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine, a trip that marked the highest level delegation since the invasion. On Monday, Austin said he hoped Russian losses in Ukraine would deter its leadership from repeating its actions. He also said Ukraine could still win the war if given the right support, he added, and that the US would send another $713m of military aid to Ukraine and other European nations. “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin said, speaking in Poland. Answering questions at a press conference, he added: “It has already lost a lot of military capability and a lot of its troops, quite frankly, and we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability.” Egeland says his organisation fears that as the Russians focus their operations on cities in the east, and as it becomes harder for these old, vulnerable people to leave, more communities will become encircled and besieged, as happened in Mariupol. “The escalation of war in east Ukraine will result in horrific bloodshed and mass displacement from the eastern regions, including Luhansk and Donetsk, re-traumatising communities who have already suffered eight years of hostilities. In some places the escalation may also lead to entire cities being besieged,” he says. “It’s heartbreaking to think about the horrors these people are forced to relive, and to know that we are unable to get lifesaving assistance into many affected areas. We call for an immediate ceasefire to stop this tidal wave of human suffering.”",World/The Independent,"Hundreds of thousands of elderly Ukrainians stranded in freezing conditions, says NGO chief",https://news.yahoo.com/hundreds-thousands-elderly-ukrainians-stranded-185808813.html

4/27/2022,"GAYLORD — The justice system is based on rights and just about everyone is aware that those who are accused of a crime are entitled to certain rights. Otsego County Prosecuting Attorney Michael Rola said it's important for everyone in the justice system — attorneys, judges, and law enforcement — to also remember that crime victims have rights, too. ""People may forget that under victim rights acts there are specific statutes that protect the rights of victims,"" Rola said. This week is National Crime Victims' Rights Week and the U.S. Department of Justice noted that the 2022 theme underscores the importance of helping crime survivors find their justice by enforcing victims' rights, expanding access to services, and ensuring equity and inclusion for all. There are acts that are more serious than others but everyone, even those who have had their bicycle or lawn mower stolen, are entitled to have their day in court, as does the accused. ""No matter the crime, a victim is a victim,"" said Manda Breuker, the chief assistant prosecuting attorney for Otsego County. ""Sometimes we will have victims who are victims for restitution only and other victims who get the full set of rights and that's a majority of our cases."" Tiffany Weber serves as the crime victim advocate for the county prosecutor's office. She makes sure that all victims are updated on the status of their cases and that victims get access to resources to address their needs. ""Every crime victim is different. They all have their own set of requirements or needs that we need to address,"" Weber said. ""Sometimes emotions are high, especially with domestic violence victims. I try to help them through the process, which can be very intimidating at times and disrupting to their lives. We try to work through that with them."" Under the law, victims are entitled to restitution. ""Generally the system is trying to make them whole for their losses,"" Breuker said. ""There are a lot of provisions, but we hope to either get their property returned or if it's been destroyed, compensated for damage."" If a victim is injured during a crime, they can get compensation for their medical treatment, which can include counseling. ""Sometimes victims will be compensated if they have to take off work to get medical attention,"" noted Breuker. Victims can also receive reimbursement for funeral expenses in a situation involving death. Domestic violence is a pattern of learned behavior in which one person uses physical, sexual, and emotional abuse to control another person, according to the Michigan State Police. Anyone can be a victim of domestic violence, regardless of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, faith or social status. One example provided includes this case from 2006, when Mary and Thomas Babb along with their young child resided in Otsego County. Mary had filed a complaint against Thomas accusing him of assault, domestic violence, and criminal sexual conduct. She said Thomas had threatened to kill her with a gun. After the charges were filed, Mary moved to the Reed City area to be near family and eventually Thomas followed. A judge also granted Mary a personal protection order, or PPO, against Thomas and he had bond conditions imposed that were supposed to prevent him from having contact with her. In January 2007, Thomas drove to where Mary was working in Mount Pleasant and waited for her to exit the building. When she got into her car to leave, Thomas rammed the vehicle so hard it overturned. Thomas then shot Mary twice in the chest, killing her. Eventually, Thomas offered guilty pleas to second degree murder and other charges and was sentenced to 55 to 72 years in prison. Rola said the only good that came out of this was that judges ""are much more aware that they need to look deeply at bond conditions in these cases."" Rola said it's important that prosecutors, law enforcement and the courts recognize how traumatizing it can be for victims to recount their experiences. ""One situation you want to try to avoid is having the victim continuously repeat the same story over and over,"" he said. If a person is convicted of a crime, the victim or victims can confront them at sentencing. ""That is the only time a victim can speak freely to the judge,"" noted Breuker. ""It's important because they get to express what they would like to happen. We encourage victims to take advantage of this."" ""It can have the most impact on what a judge will do at sentencing,"" added Rola.

4/27/2022,"U.S. stocks fell Tuesday after markets staged a rebound to end higher in the previous trading session. Investors are looking ahead to a batch of mega cap tech earnings in the coming days, with reports from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) due out after the bell. The S&P 500 dipped 0.7% at the start of trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 230 points after the index staged a 500-point recovery on Monday to close in the green. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 1.1%. Investors are in the heart of earnings season, with the S&P 500’s most heavily-weighted components scheduled to report earnings results this week. Facebook parent company Meta (FB), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) are also set to report quarterly results through Thursday. As of Friday, one-fifth of companies in the index have reported results for the first quarter so far, with 79% reflecting an earnings beat for the period – above the five-year average of 77%, according to the latest available data from FactSet. The magnitude of the earnings beat, however, is below the five-year average: 8.1%, compared to 8.9%. “The lower earnings growth rate for Q1 2022 relative to recent quarters can be attributed to both a difficult comparison to unusually high earnings growth in Q1 2021 and continuing macroeconomic headwind,” John Butters, a FactSet senior earnings analyst, said in a note. U.S. stocks paralleled movements in global equity markets on Monday, with major stock indexes in Europe and Asia largely falling on renewed concerns a COVID outbreak in China may spur another wave of lockdowns and further disrupt global supply chains. Worries of an economic slowdown also weighed on bonds and oil, with the 10-year Treasury yield retreating back to 2.8% and West Texas intermediate crude oil futures edging below $100 per barrel. ""I think the most interesting thing happening in China right now is not that the yuan's moving and not that the economy's slowing – it's that everything that's happening right now, we knew weeks ago,” China Beige Book CEO Leland Miller told Yahoo Finance Live. “We knew that the economy was slowing, we knew they were not going to stimulate in a big way, we knew that lockdowns were spreading from Shanghai to other big cities, we knew the Fed was hiking, we knew there’s a policy crackdown, so it is interesting that people are seeing today as a pivotal moment."" Elsewhere in markets, shares of Twitter jumped 5.7% after the social media giant formally announced it agreed to be acquired by Tesla CEO Elon Musk for $54.20 per share, or $44 billion. Twitter shareholders are set to receive $54.20 in cash for each share held, representing a 38% premium over Twitter's closing level on April 1. “This is the best thing that’s ever happened to Twitter,” Hedge Fund Tips' Thomas Hayes told Yahoo Finance Live. “Elon Musk is going to rehab the building and generate a lot of value for users.” — Here's where the main indexes were at the start of trading on Tuesday: S&P 500 (^GSPC): -22.31 (-0.52%) to 4,273.81 Dow (^DJI): -224.66 (-0.66%) to 33,824.80 Nasdaq (^IXIC): +165.56 (+1.29%) to 13,004.85 Crude (CL=F): +$1.65 (+1.67%) to $100.19 a barrel Gold (GC=F): +$10.90 (+0.57%) to $1,906.90 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): -7.7 bps to yield 2.7490% — Home price growth in the U.S. accelerated during the month of February, but a slowdown may be underway.
