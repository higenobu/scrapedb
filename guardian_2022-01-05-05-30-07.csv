1/5/2022,"Parts of the NHS may be overwhelmed in the coming weeks, Boris Johnson has admitted for the first time as he insisted England can “ride out” its biggest ever Covid wave “without shutting down our country once again”. The prime minister acknowledged the health service is under huge pressure after four more NHS trusts – all outside London – declared critical incidents amid rising staff absences and Covid patients. On Tuesday evening hospitals across Greater Manchester announced some non-urgent surgery and appointments would be suspended.  Heart attack patients calling 999 in parts of northern England were also asked to get a lift instead of waiting for an ambulance as hospitals in the region experienced more than double the growth rate in numbers of Covid patients compared with London, which was previously worst hit by the Omicron variant surge. With frontline worker absences fuelled by a record 218,000 new confirmed UK cases of Covid on Tuesday, Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical adviser, said the NHS faced “very substantial pressure over the next couple of weeks” – though there was not yet a “surge in mortality” seen with other waves by this stage. Johnson claimed the vaccine programme and reduced chance of hospitalisation with Omicron meant there was now a chance for the country to get through the wave without imposing new restrictions. To reduce disruption from staff off sick or isolating with Covid, he unveiled a plan for 100,000 critical workers to get tests on every working day to detect cases quickly and prevent them spreading, although some experts raised concerns that was not enough. Previously, Johnson has said he would bring in further restrictions if there was a risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed. However, the prime minister accepted it may already be happening in some areas when asked for a definition of this, given many medical staff feel that situation has already been reached. “The NHS is under huge pressure,” he told a Downing Street press conference. “I won’t provide a definition of what being overwhelmed would constitute because I think that different trusts and different places, at different moments, will feel at least temporarily overwhelmed.” He said hospitals were “at the moment … sending out signals saying that they are feeling the pressure hugely and there will be a difficult period for our wonderful NHS for the next few weeks because of Omicron”, adding: “I just think we have to get through it as best as we possibly can.” In a further sign of the intense strain on hospitals NHS bosses in Greater Manchester decided on Tuesday to postpone planned surgery and outpatient appointments amid a major surge in both Covid admissions and staff isolating with the virus. In a statement the Greater Manchester Combined Authority said that the region’s 17 hospitals “have made the difficult decision to pause some non-urgent surgery and appointments due to the rising impact of Covid.” However, surgery for cancer, heart conditions, vascular problems and organ transplantation will still go ahead, it pledged. Medics and scientists have been pressing Johnson for weeks to bring in restrictions beyond the advice for people to work from home and requirement for masks in shops and on public transport, with tougher measures already in force in Scotland and Wales. But the prime minister would find it very difficult to get support for further measures in England from Tory backbenchers, scores of whom voted against current plan B restrictions before Christmas. Johnson did not rule out further measures to tackle Covid transmission but said the current plan was to “keep our schools and our businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus”. Health chiefs reacted with concern, saying Johnson had not acknowledged the depths of the NHS’s problems despite unprecedented pressure in some areas. Pat Cullen, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said nursing staff will have “watched the prime minister’s statement in disbelief”. “One described to me today that the NHS feels more broken than she’s ever known it. This is not hysteria, this is blowing the whistle on falling standards as patient care comes under real threat,” she said. “Vaccinations alone will not reduce infections and hospitalisations – more must be done to prioritise nursing staff for access to testing and high-quality PPE. Meanwhile, the emphasis on virtual and temporary beds shows that the government still fails to recognise the value of highly skilled nursing staff or grasp the extent of the workforce crisis.” Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said attempts to reassure the public that the NHS is not being overwhelmed “does not chime with the experience of staff up and down the country who are facing fast rising hospital admissions, intense pressures on all parts of the health and care system and widespread staff absence”. “We urge the government not to allow its optimism to lead to complacency given the rapidly changing situation we are seeing on a daily basis”, added Taylor. He welcomed the plan for daily rapid testing of key workers but said it should have been made available earlier in the pandemic. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, urged Johnson to impose new restrictions to help relieve the pressure. “The facts, figures and the living reality for thousands of patients and NHS staff daily demonstrate undoubtedly that the NHS is currently already overwhelmed.”, said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA’s chair of council. “Asking the NHS to ‘just get through it’, without doing anything to help, would be to wrongly accept avoidable suffering to thousands of patients in the coming weeks.” Johnson was flanked by Whitty and Prof Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, as he outlined the approach for England. Vallance said there were “extraordinarily high levels of infection at the moment” in the UK. Hospital pressures would depend on how Omicron had an effect on the older generation, he said. Whitty acknowledged that “some hospitals, some areas of the country” will come under “very substantial pressure over the next couple of weeks” with high numbers of staff isolating over infections compounding the typical winter pressures. He also spoke of being left “saddened” by the proportion of unvaccinated patients in intensive care, as he urged people to get their boosters. He said “the great majority” of those who were in intensive care and had not been jabbed were “not anti-vaxxers in the ordinary sense with some really weird ideas” but had been taken advantage of by those seeking to misinform them online. Whitty said “misinformation” on the internet, “a lot of it deliberately placed”, about potential side effects from jabs was fuelling fears about whether Covid was important enough to warrant vaccination, as well as whether the vaccines were effective against the disease. The figure of 218,724 confirmed cases on Tuesday was a new UK record for the pandemic, although it included some delayed data from Wales and Northern Ireland.",News/World news,"Parts of NHS may be overwhelmed by Covid wave, admits Boris Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/parts-of-nhs-may-be-overwhelmed-by-covid-wave-admits-boris-johnson
1/5/2022,"A C$40bn agreement-in-principle has been reached in Canada to reform the child welfare system for First Nations people and compensate more than 200,000 individuals and families who suffered because of it. At the heart of the deal is a legacy of discrimination in child welfare systems that saw many children removed from their homes and placed in state care, and others who were denied adequate medical care and social services because of their Indigenous identity.  Half of the C$40bn (US$31bn) is earmarked for reforming a child welfare system deemed discriminatory by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT) and federal court. The other half is reserved for payments to First Nations people harmed by the on-reserve and Yukon child welfare systems between 1 April 1991 and 31 March 2022. First Nations people who experienced delays or denials of medical care and social services between 1991 and 2017 will also receive compensation. “For too long, the Government of Canada did not adequately fund or support the wellness of First Nations families and children,” said Patty Hajdu, minister of Indigenous services, as details of the deal were released on Tuesday. “No compensation amount can make up for the trauma people have experienced, but these agreements-in-principle acknowledge to survivors and their families the harm and pain caused by the discrimination in funding and services,” the minister continued. Cindy Woodhouse of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), who participated in the negotiations, told reporters that federal policies had led to the overrepresentation of First Nations in every province’s and territory’s child welfare system. “This wasn’t and isn’t about parenting. This is about poverty and First Nations children being removed from their families and communities instead of provided help with food, clothing or shelter,” Woodhouse said, adding that child welfare agencies wouldn’t receive funding unless a child was removed. Another of the First Nations organizations involved in the negotiations warned against premature celebration. Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, underlined that this was merely a non-binding agreement. “I see it as words on paper,” she said on Tuesday. “Nothing changes in the lives of children today.” First Nations children are more than 17 times more likely to be in foster care than the typical Canadian, and after they turn 18, they are often left without support to find safe housing, employment or education opportunities or even the most basic care services, Blackstock said. She said some of the $20bn earmarked for reform will go toward those needs. The $40bn settlement was reached in the 11th hour of negotiations, on 31 December – the culmination of years of hard-fought litigation, class-action lawsuits and challenges from the federal government, which began with a human rights complaint in 2007. That complaint alleged that federal authorities intentionally underfunded services for First Nations communities and needlessly removed children from their homes. One of its primary arguments was that Canada was not respecting its duty to uphold Jordan’s Principle, which was passed after the 2005 death of five-year-old Jordan River Anderson of the Norway House Cree Nation in Manitoba. Born with medical problems, Anderson spent most of his life in hospital and ultimately died while the provincial and federal governments squabbled over who should pay for his care. Jordan’s Principle dictates that the first government of contact is required to immediately cover the cost of services, and resolve jurisdictional disputes later. In Canada, healthcare is a provincial responsibility for non-Indigenous individuals, but Indigenous people fall under federal jurisdiction. Nine years later, the CHRT found the government acted intentionally. Tuesday’s settlement reflects this judgment, as well as other litigation. The outcomes of discrimination in child welfare have long been seen as an extension of the residential school system, a program that ran from the 1880s until 1996 that saw First Nations, Métis and Inuit children removed from their homes and placed in residential schools where physical, sexual and psychological abuse was often rampant. Canada's residential schools  Over the course of 100 years, more than 150,000 Indigenous children were taken from their families to attend state-funded Christian boarding schools in an effort to forcibly assimilate them into Canadian society.  They were given new names, forcibly converted to Christianity and prohibited from speaking their native languages. Thousands died of disease, neglect and suicide; many were never returned to their families.  The last residential school closed in 1996. Nearly three-quarters of the 130 residential schools were run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations, with others operated by the Presbyterian, Anglican and the United Church of Canada, which is today the largest Protestant denomination in the country. In 2015, a historic Truth and Reconciliation Commission which concluded that the residential school system amounted to a policy of cultural genocide. Survivor testimony made it clear that sexual, emotional and physical abuse were rife at the schools. And the trauma suffered by students was often passed down to younger generations – a reality magnified by systematic inequities that persist across the country. Dozens of First Nations do not have access to drinking water, and racism against Indigenous people is rampant within the healthcare system. Indigenous people are overrepresented in federal prisons and Indigenous women are killed at a rate far higher than other groups. The commissioners identified 20 unmarked gravesites at former residential schools, but they also warned that more unidentified gravesites were yet to be found across the country. In 2021, the bodies of thousands of children were discovered on the grounds of former residential schools across Canada, as well as in the United States. Blackstock noted that many of the children included in this compensation program were born to parents who attended residential schools or who were separated from their families in the “Sixties Scoop”. “[The federal government] is a repeat offender against First Nations children,” she said. David Sterns, a lawyer representing one of the classes, pointed out that more First Nations children are in foster care than were living in residential schools at their height. He said some individuals will receive more than $40,000 each for their suffering. He urged First Nations people who may have been affected to register for class inclusion at SotosClassActions.com.",News/Global development,Canada agrees C$40bn deal to reform child welfare for First Nations,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/04/canada-first-nations-child-welfare-compensation-deal
1/5/2022,"Back in October Sajid Javid insisted: “We don’t believe that the pressures currently faced by the NHS are unsustainable.” It was a statement that did not age well. It led to snorts of derision from senior doctors and hospital bosses, some of whom wondered what planet the health secretary was living on. Days later Roland Sinker, the chief executive of Cambridge university hospitals NHS trust, gave a vivid insight into how easily NHS hospitals can get overwhelmed. He told a staff Zoom meeting that the loss of 150 out of 900 beds at the trust’s main hospital – Addenbrooke’s, one of the NHS’s finest – meant that “we could barely function before Covid”. With “150 beds out of 900” unavailable, “this is ceasing to function as a hospital”.  Days earlier a patient had died in the back of an ambulance outside the hospital. Its inability to cope with demand was so worrying, Sinker said, that it might have to send patients to London or Birmingham. “I’m much more anxious and scared now” than when he took over in 2015, he admitted, adding: “You’d have to be asleep to not realise the profound nature of the crisis we’re in.” Fast forward two months and a growing number of NHS trusts in England, struggling in the face of an Omicron-driven surge in staff sickness, are now having to declare a “critical incident” – an admission that they cannot cope with the extreme pressure they are facing. “Unfortunately this does mean postponing some non-urgent operations and outpatient appointments to accommodate those patients with the most urgent clinical need,” Aaron Cummins, the chief executive of the university hospitals of Morecambe Bay trust in Cumbria, explained in a statement on Monday. It is easy to see such situations as proof that those places are overwhelmed. On Tuesday it emerged that the NHS ambulance service covering the north-east of England has begun asking friends and relatives of people who have dialled 999 to bring them to hospital themselves, even if they are having a suspected stroke or heart attack, because it cannot guarantee that paramedics will reach them in anywhere near the expected response times. Ministers prefer to trumpet the record funding the NHS is now receiving, and that the largest number of people ever now work in it in England, than hear such stories of the inability of the nation’s most important service to do its job. At Tuesday’s Covid press conference Boris Johnson declined to define what an “overwhelmed” NHS looked like. He denied suggestions that it was already in that state, though did concede that “there will be a difficult period for our wonderful NHS in the next few weeks because of Omicron”. The reality is that today’s pileup of problems shows that much of the NHS is already overwhelmed. As the NHS Providers boss, Chris Hopson, points out, while the service’s current difficulties are the result of “an exceptional Covid surge”, years of government decision-making have left it in this weakened state. “Recent winters and NHS performance pre-Covid show that, after [a] decade of longest/deepest financial squeeze in NHS history, NHS has serious capacity/demand mismatch and broken workforce model,” he said. The NHS in England has had close to 100,000 vacancies for years now, including for about 40,000 nurses and 10,000 doctors. The price of persistent understaffing is paid daily by health personnel routinely working extra hours to ensure patients get good care; that goodwill helps keep the NHS from falling over. Patients experience it in the form of delays in getting help or having a diagnostic test. And it is also felt by a service which, in some parts, too often teeters perilously close to falling over, usually under the extra strain winter brings, but sometimes in summer too, and certainly as a result of Omicron. Analysis by Stephen Rocks of the Health Foundation thinktank shows that the UK has only 3.93 hospital doctors per 100,000 people – the lowest in Europe. It also has just 2.42 beds per 100,000 people, the second lowest in Europe after Sweden, which has only 2.07. And it also ranks low down the international league table for its supply of nurses, CT scanners and MRI scanners. The size of the NHS budget is important. But providing high-quality healthcare involves more than that. It also involves giving the service the staff it needs and taking firm action to reduce illness. Today’s immediate, escalating NHS crisis has long roots, which are also political roots. Years of decisions by David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson, especially their inaction on staffing, left it enfeebled and woefully underprepared for this level of extreme pressure, which the critical incidents and unavailability of ambulances dramatically illustrate. The service’s many supporters can only hope that it does not break altogether in the coming days.",News/Society,NHS is in crisis but the roots go much further back than Omicron,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/04/nhs-is-in-crisis-but-the-roots-go-much-further-back-than-omicron
1/5/2022,"The changing of a year is a time to reflect, to both remember moments that have passed and imagine how they might have happened differently. These considerations are likely to be personal: should I really have let my hair grow long? What if I had not forced the hire car into the narrow parking space next to the concrete pillar? They can also be grander too and one thought that has returned frequently over the course of the past week is of the latter type. It runs as follows: did we miss a trick by not letting the European Super League happen? By we I mean the source of the amorphous people power credited with bringing the 12-club breakaway competition to a halt. I also mean specifically the English contingent of that protest because the dynamics at work in Spain and Italy are different. Finally I mean the part of that group described as the ‘legacy fan’, those who watch their team in a stadium and who support them in a kind of unconditional fashion, as if we were almost part of it ourselves.  The legacy fan is probably a term most legacy fans would rather not have used about them but it’s here and it means something, so it’s worth using. It’s certainly distinct from the generic ‘fan’, which is used a lot but means a number of different things to different people. The Super League was apparently stopped by the fans. But it was also stopped for the fans because, in the words of the Premier League, it would damage the concept of “an open pyramid, progression through sporting merit and the highest standards of sporting integrity”. Yet most legacy fans will likely be scratching their heads to locate clear examples of each of these phenomena. An open pyramid? The top of the Premier League is choked off by the Super League clubs, the top of the Championship by those who fell out of the top flight and got to spend parachute payments, while the top of League One features several clubs who did all that and still nearly went bust. Most fans outside that group feels boxed in, increasingly frustrated and likely desperate for a billionaire of dubious means to land their helicopter in the club car park. Sporting merit, sure, if you mean spending power in the transfer market. And sporting integrity, well, not only is it an issue pertinent to the debate over a Covid-disrupted schedule but it is inherent in most of the regular sources of debate – from VAR to simulation to tactical fouling to, once again, the disparity in resources available to clubs in the same division. So let’s say that stopping the breakaway does not mean everything is fine. Could allowing it have made it better? To conduct this thought experiment I must introduce one condition: that when the big six left for the Super League, they left English football altogether. The real plan had it so that there was Super League midweek and Premier League at the weekends (for a bit at least). But in this version, that’s a no. They go. They take their money, their global recruitment networks and their in-house content production teams with them. They pay a one-off exit fee and can concentrate on six-week road trips to China for quadruple headers against Beijing Guoan (oh, yes, one other condition is that the European Super League becomes the Global Super League). Left behind are largely ruins. The Premier League uses the exit money to stave off furious broadcasters, but contemplates a future shorn of global eyeballs. The Championship sees its own exodus, of speculative owners no longer keen on ramming clubs up that open pyramid. Ryan Reynolds cancels his Airbnb in Wrexham. After raging about the betrayal of the big six for a fortnight, radio stations suddenly come to the conclusion that the GSL is, actually, quite an intriguing prospect. Twitter continues to be a squall of egoistic tantrums, but that is what it is there for. Amid the chaos, however, things are suddenly possible that never were before. Sustainability, with limits on owner investment and wage caps at a percentage of clubs’ turnover. With TV interest diminished, public broadcasters can suddenly afford to show games again, but not that many because they have a Stephen Graham drama to squeeze in too. Clubs can no longer afford substantial transfer fees and turn towards developing their own talent. They must also nurture relationships with the one reliable source of income they have: the good old legacy fan. Not that it would all be manna and ambrosia. Some legacy fans, those of the Super six clubs, who have been ignored and traduced as much as any other, would have to follow their teams to the GSL. Those who remained, the virtuous souls who travel through rain and disrupted railway services to support their team, would also have a dirty secret: they’d enjoy watching the GSL too. Like the Premier League before it, the GSL would offer entertainment comparable to anything on earth. It’s simply that to save the sport, and to maximise the entertainment, the two had to be separated. That separation had once seemed illogical, never mind impossible, but once it had happened it made sense. Now it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle had finished. The legacy fan had won the victory over themselves.",Sport/Football,"For the good of football, we should have let the European Super League happen | Paul MacInnes",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/european-super-league-premier-league-championship-finances
1/5/2022,"Call it a trial run. With parliament still on recess (what better way for MPs to endear themselves to the country than to award themselves an extra day off over the new year break?), Tuesday was as good a time as any for Keir Starmer to test-drive his latest pitch to voters. If it went well, so much the better: he would be ahead of the game. But if parts fell flat then there would be plenty of time to put them right in more important speeches ahead. Such as ones where more than a handful of people outside Westminster were listening. Yet even though the stakes couldn’t have been much lower, the Labour leader was leaving nothing to chance. The set was the full Liz “Gloriana” Truss, with two large union jacks for a backdrop. If it took draping himself in flags to prove that he – and the Labour party – were patriotic then so be it. Keir didn’t care if he was laying it on a bit thick. He would bathe in red, white and blue if necessary. Whatever it took.  Starmer started as he meant to go on by celebrating the country we live in. Remembering how lucky he – and we – are to be British. We have the Queen. The NHS. The rule of law. The Queen. Musicians. Universities. The Queen. The BBC. Fashion. The Queen. But it wasn’t unpatriotic to suggest there might be one or two areas where there was room for improvement. Over the course of the pandemic, the British people and the opposition had done the decent thing by giving the government the benefit of the doubt. But the government had betrayed that trust by thinking the rules didn’t apply to them. Not just the serial liar and party organiser Boris Johnson. The betrayal went far deeper than that, into a Tory party that had been in power too long and took the country for granted. So replacing the prime minister with Truss or Rishi Sunak would make no difference. What was needed was a new Labour government. So far, so good. But then it all got a little vague. After bigging up the achievements of Atlee – he even dared mention nuclear weapons, Wilson and Blair governments – the best that Starmer could offer was a new social contract. If we worked hard and obeyed the rules, Labour would give us security, prosperity and respect. Which was fine, as far as it went. But it didn’t quite feel as substantial as founding the NHS, Nato, the Open University and the national minimum wage. He also promised to make Brexit work. Which could have been a little rash as no one has, as yet, come close to even the vaguest hint of how they intend to do that. Starmer was more assertive when it came to the media Q&A at the end. After grabbing the moral high ground by pointing out the government’s failure to prepare schools for the new term, and that it had only been down to Labour votes that it had been able to implement plan B, Keir took on both Corbyns. First Piers and the anti-vaxxers, then Jeremy. He made no apology for having pretended to sign up to the Corbyn masterplan only to ditch it once he became leader. He was in the business of winning elections rather than being in opposition. The public had had their chance to vote for Jeremy’s manifesto in 2019 and had given Boris an 80-seat majority. Enough was enough. And no, Johnson was most definitely not the sort of prime minister who should be knighted. The speech hadn’t been quite as polished as Starmer might have ideally liked but it had been more than a decent marker towards the next election. And it was certainly enough to spook the Tories into bringing forward the Downing Street press conference by a day. Boris couldn’t take the risk of Starmer grabbing all the headlines on the evening news bulletins. Or for Keir to be seen as the only leader working. You could tell that Johnson didn’t really have anything new to say at the presser because he took an age saying it. That’s one of Boris’s most telling giveaways. His bullshit and waffle meters work perfectly in sync. Just about the only part of his government that does. So what we got was a lot of hesitation, repetition and deviation. We have a prime minister whose only discernible current talent – other than as a party host – is to talk complete bollocks. His main message was that Omicron was very serious but not so serious for him to need to do much about it. Rather, we should accept that his hands are tied by the libertarian maniacs on the right of the party who couldn’t even accept wearing a mask on public transport. So, as the chances of them approving anything more than that was nil, and imposing further restrictions for a second time with Labour votes was politically unacceptable, we were stuck where we were. Sticking to plan B and keeping our fingers tightly crossed. Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance alluded to problems with this approach but stopped short of spelling them out. So it was left to the media. Johnson talked of hospitals not getting overwhelmed, when at least eight trusts are already operating on an emergency footing without the staff or protective equipment to treat their patients. “Um, er, just get boosted,” he said. He hasn’t even realised that the vaccination programme has stalled. Here we were. With an incompetent prime minister who was making decisions for entirely the wrong reasons. And we would just have to sit tight and hope it somehow turned out for the best. Starmer must have been watching and thinking maybe he had less work to do on his speech than he had imagined.",News/Politics,Starmer flies the flags in test drive of patriotic pitch to voters | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/04/starmer-flies-the-flags-in-test-drive-of-patriotic-pitch-to-voters
1/5/2022,"Twitter has permanently banned the popular news aggregation service Politics For All, in a sign of how the social media platform has substantial power to deprive news outlets of their audience without warning. A spokesperson said the account was “suspended for violating the Twitter Rules on platform manipulation and spam” and would not be allowed to return.  Politics for All, founded by 19-year-old Nick Moar, grew rapidly over the last twelve months by aggressively aggregating news stories published and reported by mainstream outlets. Its understanding of what would go viral on Twitter attracted hundreds of thousands of followers, including MPs and government ministers. However, the account was also accused of distorting stories by focusing on specifics that would go viral. Mainstream journalists also complained that its emoji-laden breaking news posts would often attract more social media shares than the posts by the outlets who actually reported the stories. Despite this, its substantial following enabled the account to rapidly disrupt political news cycles by highlighting stories that might otherwise have been missed. It also built a relatively mainstream fanbase – with the likes of former Manchester United footballer Gary Neville among those calling for the account to be reinstated. Moar, who was last year hired by the Spectator to run its social media accounts, declined to comment on the deletion of Politics For All. Many other related accounts he set up under the For All banner, which were run with the assistance of a team of young staff, have also been permanently suspended. One individual at Politics for All said: “The fact Twitter will allow the Taliban on their platform but not a simple news aggregator is quite something. We will be appealing this decision.” However, it is unclear how the aggregator could appeal against the permanent suspension, which is similar to the treatment handed out to former US President Donald Trump. Twitter has stated the suspension is final and its rules on platform manipulation apply to users who “artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behaviour that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience”. The specific behaviour that led to Politics for All being banned remains unknown. The deletion of a relatively popular news aggregation service by Twitter could attract political scrutiny.

1/5/2022,"Good morning. Weeks of speculation about Novak Djokovic’s involvement in the Australia Open have come to an end after the world No 1 last night revealed he has a medical exemption to get around Melbourne’s strict quarantine rules. Meanwhile, more hospital staff in NSW speak out about the pressure of staff shortages and record Covid infections. Djokovic is on his way to Melbourne to defend his Australian Open title after he refused to divulge his Covid vaccination status. Australian Open organisers confirmed he had received a medical exemption and said two panels of experts had reviewed the case. The Australian Technical Advisory Group allows exemptions for reasons including acute major medical conditions to any serious adverse effect from previous doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. The reason for Djokovic’s exemption is unclear and has garnered mixed responses from his peers.  Hospitals workers in NSW have vented their anger at being left on the frontline with seriously depleted levels of staffing amid a major surge in Covid cases. “The light at the end of a tunnel is a fricking train at the moment,” said Gil Wilson, a senior nurse at the Lismore Base hospital. “We can’t see an end to this.” NSW set another record of new infections, with 23,131 cases reported yesterday and a 28% positivity rate.

Over the past two years something shifted in many Australian families. For some the upheaval meant not just stress but slowing down, getting closer and becoming more adaptable. “The pandemic reset the importance of just being able to spend time with your children,” says Nick Tebbey, national executive officer of Relationships Australia. “People drew real strength from that, and were almost surprised by how much they enjoyed their time together.” On the evening of Sunday 5 January 1975, the bulk carrier Lake Illawarra travelled down the Derwent River in Hobart and missed the main navigation challenge under the Tasman Bridge. It brought down two piers and caused more than 100 metres of road to collapse 45 metres into the river below, along with four cars that drove over the gap. Twelve people died, and casualties would have been much higher had it not been a quiet Sunday evening in the new year holiday period. One of our favourite Full Story episodes from 2021 was about First Nations representation on the reality TV show RuPaul’s Drag Race Down Under. The show was marred by controversies about race and a lack of diversity but it also saw the debut of its first Aboriginal drag queen: Biripi and Worimi queen JoJo Zaho. JoJo talks to Laura Murphy-Oates about the power of First Nations drag and the journey to fame.

His withdrawal from a Melbourne warm-up event due to asthma means he will slide outside the top 100. On a live estimate Kyrgios now sits at 115 but it is possible that will dip further by the next official rankings release on Monday, just a week out from the Australian Open. Covid forced the closure of almost 270 early childhood centres in NSW yesterday with more shutdowns expected as the industry deals with staff shortages, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. Businesses are selling rapid antigen tests on Uber Eats for as much as $65, according to the Age but the consumer watchdog has told the ABC that while it is investigating tests being sold at excessive prices it has not seen evidence of widespread price gouging. National cabinet will meet for the first time in 2022 with rapid antigen tests expected to top the agenda.

1/5/2022,"Prof Chris Whitty has sparked confusion by saying people should stay in self-isolation “until their test goes negative”, despite official guidance allowing a day 10 exit even with a positive lateral flow test. Last month the rules on self-isolation in England changed to reduce the self-isolation period from 10 to seven days for people who have tested positive for Covid, provided they have a negative lateral flow test on both day six and seven and they do not have a high temperature. Wales and Northern Ireland have followed suit, with Scotland facing pressure to do the same.  The guidance adds it is not necessary to continue to use lateral flow device (LFD) tests after 10 days. “You should not take any more LFD tests after the 10th day of your isolation period and you may stop self-isolating after this day,” it says. “This is because you are unlikely to be infectious after the 10th day of your isolation period. “Even if you have a positive LFD test result on the 10th day of your self-isolation period you should not take any more LFD tests after this day.” Responding to a question from a member of the public on Tuesday, England’s chief medical officer said a lateral flow test was a helpful tool. “It is a pretty good guide, very good guide, actually, to whether someone is at that moment infectious,” Witty said, adding that those who tested negative on day six and seven in isolation were much less likely to be infectious to other people than if they had not done those tests. But, he added: “Obviously, if they’re still positive, then they do need to stay in isolation till it goes negative.” According to government guidance lateral flow tests should not be taken before day six of the self-isolation period, but after that self-isolation may be ended after two consecutive negative tests taken at least 24 hours apart. “You should stop testing after you have had two consecutive negative test results,” the guidance states. That means the earliest someone could leave self-isolation would be day seven. Should someone test positive on day six, however, they would not be able to leave self-isolation until day eight at the earliest, after a negative lateral flow test on both day seven and day eight.However, there is a caveat for those isolating without symptoms. “If you are isolating because of a positive test result but did not have any symptoms, and you develop Covid-19 symptoms within your isolation period, start a new isolation period from the day your symptoms start,” the guidance states.",News/UK news,"No need to isolate after day 10 even with positive test, England rules say",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/no-need-to-isolate-after-day-10-even-with-positive-test-england-rules-say
1/5/2022,"Caleb Azumah Nelson was working part-time in the Apple Store in London when he decided to “take a gamble” on himself and try to write his first novel. On Tuesday evening, his debut, Open Water, was named winner of the Costa first novel award, praised by judges as “deeply moving, searingly intimate and just so now”. Open Water follows the lives of two young Black British artists – he a photographer, she a dancer – as they start to fall in love after meeting in a south-east London pub. It beat titles including AK Blakemore’s The Manningtree Witches and Kate Sawyer’s The Stranding to win the £5,000 Costa prize. “We all loved this contemporary portrait of masculinity – it’s like nothing else we’ve ever read,” said judges.  Nelson, a British-Ghanaian short story writer and photographer, said it was “so surreal” to be named winner of the award. “I think I am honestly still getting used to the fact that I have not only put a book out, but that it’s been really well received. All writers do this – you kind of commit these acts of bravery by putting words down on the page, and then you close your eyes when you’ve done it and hope someone might read it,” he said. Nelson quit his job at the Apple Store to write Open Water, spending the summer of 2019 in the British Library writing all day. The manuscript sparked a nine-way bidding war before ending up with Viking, an imprint of Penguin. “The main thing I was trying to hone in on was this story of intimacy between people who might feel romantically for each other – these moments that often go unnoticed and undocumented but are really the fabric of our lives,” he said. “I think that my background as a photographer means that I’m just attracted to these really tiny moments in people’s lives that l expand outwards.” Claire Fuller won the £5,000 Costa novel award for her fourth novel, Unsettled Ground, the story of 51-year-old twins Jeanie and Julius, who live in poverty and rural isolation with their mother, Dot, until her death means they are at risk of losing everything. Already shortlisted for the Women’s prize, it is a “masterpiece of storytelling and craft”, said judges. “I’m still lost for words to have won,” said Fuller, who beat authors including Nadifa Mohamed and Elif Shafak to the prize. “It’s an amazing privilege to be recognised in this way.” The novel has its roots in Fuller’s son’s discovery of an abandoned caravan in the woods. “It was derelict and empty, and my son just knows I like weird places. So I went out to see it, and it was just really atmospheric. It made me start thinking: who would have lived here? And how would they have managed?” she said. “And then Jeanie, the main character, was just created in my head without knowing what her story would be or where she came from, or even that she had a twin brother. I had no idea till I started writing it.” John Preston won the Costa biography award for Fall: The Mystery of Robert Maxwell, which judges called an “epic, immersive, cinematic telling” of the life of the late media mogul and MP. The poetry prize went to former London teacher Hannah Lowe for The Kids, which draws on a decade of teaching in an inner-city London sixth form, and the children’s book category was won by Manjeet Mann for The Crossing, a verse novel inspired by the refugee crisis, about two teenagers from very different worlds. The Costas are open solely to authors resident in the UK and Ireland, and go to the “most enjoyable” books of the year. The Crossing, said judges, “will enrich all who read it”, while The Kids made judges “want to punch the air with joy”. A panel of judges chaired by the journalist and broadcaster Reeta Chakrabarti will now select the Costa book of the year from the five category winners, to be announced on 1 February. Last year, Monique Roffey’s novel The Mermaid of Black Conch took the overall £30,000 prize.",Arts/Books,Caleb Azumah Nelson wins Costa first novel award for Open Water,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/04/caleb-azumah-nelson-wins-costa-first-novel-award-for-open-water
1/5/2022,"Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was found guilty on Monday of fraud, concluding a high-profile trial that captivated Silicon Valley and chronicled the missteps of the now-defunct blood testing startup.  After seven days of deliberation, the jury in San Jose, California, convicted Holmes on four charges: one count of conspiracy to defraud investors, and three counts of wire fraud against investors. It acquitted her on three charges, including one conspiracy to defraud patients and two charges related to patients who received inaccurate test results. It remained deadlocked on three remaining charges. The split verdicts are “a mixed bag for the prosecution, but it’s a loss for Elizabeth Holmes because she is going away to prison for at least a few years”, said David Ring, a lawyer who has followed the case closely. A hearing has been set for next week during which the prosecutors will reveal whether they plan to retry Holmes on the three charges the jury could not come to an agreement on. Experts say such a retrial is not very likely, as the existing convictions already carry considerable sentencing time. With no prior convictions, Holmes is unlikely to face the maximum prison time her charges carry, which is 20 years, said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers. While she will probably face several in prison and more on probation, Holmes is almost certain to appeal, Rahmani added: “She’s not someone who is going to want to do even five months in prison, much less five years,” he said. Holmes walked freely out of the courthouse on Monday after parties agreed she would not be taken into custody until her sentencing hearing. That date will be set at the hearing regarding the retrial next week. It is expected the judge will take into account the timing of the fraud trial of Holmes’ former partner, Sunny Balwani. His trial is scheduled to start next month in the same San Jose courtroom where Holmes’ legal saga unfolded. The former CEO’s loss marks a milestone for Silicon Valley – an industry that has for years evaded accountability in its pervasive culture of “fake it till you make it” that encourages founders to make big promises, often with little proof. “Silicon Valley has thus far been famously been resistant to much prosecutorial activity, because its business model assumes you are going to take an aggressive, optimistic view of your product or service to attract investors,” said Jack Sharman, a white-collar defense lawyer at Lightfoot, a law firm in Alabama. “And if that product or service succeeds, you’re not a fraudster, you’re a visionary,” he added. Theranos sold a promise to improve health with multiple tests on one drop of blood – a claim that despite having little scientific proof raised hundreds of millions of dollars and attracted big-name investors such as the media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the former secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Once a charismatic figure, Holmes was initially hailed as a visionary. Her story represented just how far the cult of personality in Silicon Valley can take someone. That same cult of personality, however, became her downfall: during the trial, prosecutors painted a picture of Holmes as a strict, power-hungry leader willing to go to any lengths to save her company’s image, repressing internal and external dissent and manipulating the press. “She chose fraud over business failure,” prosecutor Jeff Schenk said in his closing arguments. “She chose to be dishonest with investors and patients. That choice was not only callous, it was criminal.” The verdict may embolden prosecutors at large to more aggressively pursue cases of white collar crime and fraud, said Rahmani. In turn, startups may now tread more carefully when making big promises, he added. “In Silicon Valley, this conviction will resonate with the big law firms that advise startup companies,” Rahmani said. “Attorneys are going to be advising their clients to be more careful, especially in what they say to investors.” Investors are already taking heed: Silicon Valley investor Jason Calacanis, who was an early backer of major firms like Uber and Robinhood, said the verdict was a “reminder to founders”. “Never lie, never bend the truth, always be honest about where you are at with your traction, especially when raising money,” he tweeted.
