3/9/2022,"Health experts have widely denounced Florida’s decision to recommend against Covid-19 vaccinations for children, describing it as “irresponsible”, “reckless” and “dangerous”. In a pronouncement which stunned experts on Monday, Florida’s controversial surgeon general Dr Joseph Ladapo said the state would be the first to “recommend against” Covid-19 vaccination for “healthy children”. The move followed two recent Covid-19 surges in which pediatric hospitalization was believed to be higher because of low vaccination rates among children. “It’s very generous to call it a recommendation, because recommendations come with supporting evidence and transparency,” said Saad B Omer, director of the Yale Institute of Global Health and professor of medicine in infectious diseases. “Trying to interpret that is trying to create a GPS map from a dream. You don’t know where it’s coming from, what is the scientific rationale, if any,” said Omer. The announcement is “irresponsible … it is inappropriate and it is dangerous”, he said. Ladapo made the announcement on Monday at the end of a roundtable discussion hosted by Republican governor Ron DeSantis, saying: “The Florida department of health is going to be the first state to officially recommend against the Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children.” The state has not yet released a formal policy to describe exactly who would be included in the designation “healthy children”. The move goes against accepted advice from federal health authorities and a large majority of independent experts, who recommend vaccines as a powerful tool to protect children from the worst outcomes of Covid-19. The roundtable came as Covid-19 cases driven by the Omicron variant fall and federal health authorities seek to wind down pandemic prevention measures such as masking and social distancing. Although children face much lower risks from Covid-19 than older adults, “there is a small minority who don’t do well with the infection and recent CDC data showed vaccines prevent half of urgent care and hospital visits,” said Dr Kawsar Talaat, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “Our kids have lost a lot during the pandemic, and vaccines are one thing we can do to help give them a sense of normalcy.” The Delta and Omicron Covid waves brought record-high levels of pediatric hospitalizations. These variants were not believed to be more dangerous to children. Instead, experts believe more children were hospitalized because they have low vaccination rates relative to the rest of the US population. “Covid-19 is in the top 10 causes of deaths for every age group. That’s why we’re recommending the vaccines for everyone ages five and older,” said Noel Brewer, a behavioral scientist and professor at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Public Health. “No one needs these folks in Florida establishing policies around vaccines – they simply lack the expertise to do this well,” said Brewer, who is also a member of the Lancet Commission on Vaccine Refusal, Acceptance, and Demand in the US. “People deliberately sowing doubt about Covid-19 vaccines undermines confidence and uptake in the vaccine,” said Brewer. “One of the clear effects of anti-vaccine propaganda is it harms the public. This announcement by the state of Florida is not helping anything. It will not save lives – in fact, it will cause more people to die.” Nationally, just 26% of children aged five to 11 and 57% of adolescents aged 12-17 are fully vaccinated. Comparatively, 65% of the US population is vaccinated. In Florida, 66% of people are vaccinated, though coverage varies widely throughout the state. The FDA authorized vaccines for adolescents in spring 2021 and for young children in the fall. In January, the FDA also authorized a booster dose for adolescents aged 12-15. The CDC has also recommended vaccines for these age groups, as independent expert advisory panels to both the FDA and CDC. Children younger than five are not eligible for a vaccine. “This has been looked at independently by four groups of experts and for a very good reason, because during this Delta and Omicron wave we’ve seen unprecedented numbers of pediatric hospitalization,” said Dr Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine. Hotez is also developing a low-cost Covid vaccine. DeSantis has attacked Covid-19 prevention measures throughout the two years of the pandemic. At the same time, regular Floridians have suffered greatly. More than 71,000 people have died in the state, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or 332 people for every 100,000 residents, far above the national average of 287 deaths per 100,000. By another metric, Florida would have the worst death rate in the world if it were a country. Hotez said many experts believe another wave of Covid, perhaps caused by a new variant, could hit the south and Florida this summer, “just like it did in 2020 and 2021”. Covid-19 “is a highly preventable death at this point,” said Talaat. “Almost nobody should be dying of Covid, especially over the last year and yet we’re almost at 1 million deaths in the US.” This story was amended to correct a misspelling of the name of Florida’s surgeon general, Dr Joseph Ladapo.",News/US news,Florida vaccine plan for children denounced as ‘irresponsible and reckless’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/florida-children-vaccination-coronavirus
3/9/2022,"McDonald’s is temporarily closing its 850 restaurants in Russia and pausing all operations in the country, a decision that will affect 62,000 jobs, after mounting calls for action after the invasion of Ukraine. It was later announced that Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Starbucks would also suspend their operations in the country. The burger chain said it would continue to pay the salaries for all employees in Russia and its charitable arm, Ronald McDonald House Charities, would also continue in the country. In a message to staff and franchisees, Chris Kempczinski, the chief executive of McDonald’s, said the situation was “extraordinarily challenging for a global brand like ours”, which he said worked with hundreds of local suppliers and partners producing its food. “We understand the impact this will have on our Russian colleagues and partners,” he said. But he added: “Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine.” McDonald’s and other western food and drink companies have faced calls to pull out of Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. On Tuesday night the coffee giant Starbucks became the latest company to say it was suspending all business activity in Russia. It said it would stop shipping its products and its cafes, run by a licensee, would close temporarily. The company said that Kuwait-based Alshaya Group, which operates at least 100 Starbucks cafes, would still support its nearly 2,000 staff in Russia “who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood”. Coca-Cola Co later said it was suspending its business in Russia. Pepsi also followed suit, saying the sale of its brands, capital investments and all advertising would be suspended in Russia and it would support “our 20,000 Russian associates and the 40,000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain”. It said it would continue to sell daily essentials, such as milk and other dairy offerings, baby formula and baby food, in Russia. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told CNN two days ago that “all western companies must withdraw from Russia” on humanitarian grounds. “We were upset to hear companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald’s remain in Russia and continue providing their products,” he said. McDonald’s, which has operated in Russia for more than 30 years, said it could not predict when it may be able to reopen its restaurants there and would “continue to assess the situation and determine if any additional measures are required”. It said it would “closely monitor the humanitarian situation” as well as disruption to its supply chain. McDonald’s is also paying full salaries to its Ukrainian employees and has donated $5m (£3.8m) to an assistance fund for employees as well as supporting relief efforts led by the International Red Cross. The McDonald’s shutdown comes after a host of other consumer brands including Netflix, Levi’s, Burberry, Ikea and Unilever, the owner of Marmite and Ben & Jerry’s, announced they had halted business in the country. Leading professional services firms including KPMG, PwC, EY and Deloitte have also cut off businesses in Russia and Belarus. Companies around the world have been scrambling to assess their links with Russia after the US, EU and UK sought to isolate it economically with sanctions. Sanctions have also made it illegal for US, EU or UK companies to serve some of the biggest Russian businesses, including banks such as Sberbank, Gazprombank and VTB.",News/World news,"McDonald’s, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Pepsi suspend Russian operations",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/mcdonalds-bows-to-pressure-and-closes-all-its-russian-restaurants
3/9/2022,"It’s unlikely the Cranbourne Royal Botanical Gardens will ever see anything like it again: a group of models, wearing designer clothes, wander its beautifully crafted Australian Garden. Clad in suits and gowns, many walk barefoot through water features and across grey concrete. The models are here to shoot a digital runway, a partnership between Australian Made and the Melbourne fashion festival. Every garment featured in the film is made in Australia and licensed to carry the Australian Made logo: the familiar green triangle with its yellow kangaroo. The runway is pitched to elevate Australian designers in the global market and, when it launches on 9 March, consumers in the United Kingdom and America will be able to shop from it. But sourcing product for the film revealed limitations in Australia’s manufacturing capacity. For instance, the footwear – or lack thereof. The film’s stylist, Emily Ward, describes finding shoes that met the Australian Made requirements as challenging. “I sort of went down the line exploring some brands … and then we realised they weren’t actually made here, so we had to move on.” She settled on two brands who make their products locally, Nelson Made and Alias Mae. But even then, certain styles did not meet Australian Made requirements. To use the Australian Made logo, an item has to meet the test of “substantial transformation”. According to Ben Lazzarro, the company’s chief executive, this means “you’ve got to cut and sew here”. If you take the example of a shirt, he says, “as long as you cut that material here, sew and form it into a shirt here, you can legally make a ‘made in Australia’ claim,” even if the fabric has been imported. The reason it was harder for Ward to find shoes is because often the leather for footwear is imported pre-cut. The shoes she did source for the runway were from designers, “handcrafting shoes on a smaller scale, who aren’t in the mass market”. “R.M. Williams used to be made locally in Australia,” she says, as did other more established brands. But “they’re not 100% Australian Made any more”, though last year the owners of R.M. Williams suggested they may return to 100% local manufacturing. The runway featured nine Australian labels, including Bianca Spender and Viktoria and Woods, two brands that have manufactured locally since their inception. Margie Woods, the creative director of Viktoria and Woods, described the campaign as “a really important, positive step” for brands that do make the effort to manufacture here. “It is a lot easier to go offshore.” Woods describes the challenges of making in Australia as multifaceted. She says the most common is the cost of labor; another is “quite a big skills shortage here”. Finally, the lack of machinery and advanced technology means certain categories like outerwear, denim, leather and complicated knitwear are particularly difficult to make locally. Woods recently invested $130,000 in a knitting machine to support one of her makers. She says the purchase, which is sizeable for an independent designer, “will allow us to produce 4,000 more garments in Australia per year”. Mary Lou Ryan, the co-founder of Bassike – another brand committed to local manufacturing – says Australia has fallen behind. “There hasn’t really been a) the infrastructure and government support and b) … the support from Australian brands to get behind the industry either.” Ryan suggests government funding for technology and automated machinery, bringing back skills through tertiary education and trade programs and more support for immigration could help Australia catch up. Subsidies, skilled migration visas and technological investment are suggestions echoed by Woods, who says “from a government level something can be done … to keep local manufacturing alive”. Australian brands, meanwhile, need to deliver commitment and continuity, Ryan says. If brands come in and try it for six months, “then find it’s too hard and go back offshore … things won’t move ahead”. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Bianca Spender says designers need to be conscious of the fragility of manufacturing businesses. “Designers can devastate manufacturers,” she says. Things like delayed payments, asking for lots of work on season then nothing the next and a lack of commitment “can leave them out of pocket very quickly”. Lazzarro is aware of the manufacturing issues the fashion industry faces, but he explains it is not the role of Australian Made to get involved. “We’re not a lobby or advocacy group,” he says, “we’re a licensing and a marketing group”. The Australian Fashion Council (AFC) has taken a different approach. In 2020, they approached the then minister for industry, science and technology, Karen Andrews, and requested support to increase demand for all Australian fashion, regardless of whether or not it was produced here. Leila Naja Hibri, the chief executive of the AFC, says “if we only look at manufacturing and making, you’re really regressing because we’re not thinking of the soft skills. Australians are amazing at design and product development. “We absolutely want Australian products to be made here,” she says. But since most of the industry is making offshore, she believes the path to healthy local manufacturing runs through championing all Australian fashion businesses. The result of this lobbying was a grant of $1m from the Department of Industry Science, Energy and Resources to create an Australian fashion certified trademark that can be licensed by brands. The mark is set to be launched at the end of March, and has different criteria to Australian Made’s “substantial transformation” requirement. According to Naja Hibri, it will look at things like ownership, whether most of a brand’s workforce is in Australia, and whether the brand pays taxes here. Naja Hibri says that only increasing demand for Australian fashion more broadly will “give brands the fiscal headspace to be able to expand.” At which point, they can “work on projects to skill workers, hire the right people and manufacture locally”.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"At Melbourne fashion festival, models go barefoot for lack of Australian-made shoes",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/09/at-melbourne-fashion-festival-models-go-barefoot-for-lack-of-australian-made-shoes

3/9/2022,"Boris Johnson has created a new minister to deal with the growing refugee crisis after a succession of Conservative MPs condemned the Home Office for failing Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion. The prime minister was forced to act on Tuesday after Tory backbenchers joined opposition members in claiming that Priti Patel’s department has been “dragging its feet” over visa applications. Richard Harrington has been appointed as the minister for refugees, Downing Street said. Harrington, a lobbyist and businessman who was previously minister for Syrian refugees and stepped down as an MP in 2019, will be made a life peer sitting in the House of Lords. His appointment comes as 45 charities including Oxfam, Save The Children and the Refugee Council have sent a letter to the Guardian claiming the government’s “chaotic, heartless and unkind” polices send a clear message to Ukrainians that they are not welcome in the UK. The backlash from MPs came in the Commons after it was revealed that the UK has so far issued 500 visas to Ukrainian nationals seeking sanctuary. The EU has warned that as many as five million could flee to the bloc if Russia’s invasion continued amid demands from MPs and lawyers for ministers to relax or streamline visa rules. Ministers have continued to resist visa waivers or allowing Ukrainians to apply once they have arrived in the UK, claiming there is a security risk that Russian agents could enter the UK. At a Commons session that Patel did not attend, Sir Roger Gale, the MP for North Thanet, claimed the home secretary had misled the House on Monday by claiming that a visa application centre had been set up for Ukrainians in Calais. He said: “In response to my question yesterday, the home secretary said: ‘I have already made it clear in terms of the visa application centre that has now been set up en route to Calais that we have staff in Calais.’ “That was untrue and under any normal administration that in itself would be a resignation [matter].” On Monday afternoon, there were still signs in Calais telling refugees to go to centres in Paris or Brussels. The Home Office minister Kevin Foster replied indicating that Patel had on Monday also said that a new processing centre for visas would soon be set up. “I understand the home secretary clarified her remarks yesterday. There is a reason why we believe it is right that key security checks are done before people arrive here in the UK,” he said. MPs told ministers that they had received letters from constituents requesting help bringing loved ones from Ukraine and offers of charity for Ukrainian people because the Home Office appeared unable to help. Conservative former immigration minister Mark Harper said the government needs to “grip the pace of this” while Andrew Murrison, another ex-Tory minister, asked why the Republic of Ireland has welcomed more than 2,000 refugees from Ukraine but the UK has “come nowhere even close to that”. Alec Shelbrooke, the Conservative MP for Elmet and Rothwell, demanded the Home Office “get a grip” on processing visa applications for Ukrainian refugees. “Does the Home Office recognise that this is a war of the likes that has not been seen for 80 years in Europe? We don’t want to stand in this house and listen to plans and processes, we want dates, we want action … This is a disgrace,” he said. The Conservative MP Julian Sturdy said his York Outer constituents were ready and willing to offer help, adding: “The only barrier to their support seems to be Home Office bureaucracy.” Jason McCartney highlighted the “vibrant” Ukrainian community in his Colne Valley constituency. “We’ve done so much on sanctions, on humanitarian aid and on military aid so why are we dragging our feet with all this bureaucracy?” the MP said. The Home Office is currently trying to expand its operations in cities near the Ukrainian border to process applicants. Hundreds of people seeking help are already in Calais but have been asked to apply from Paris or Brussels. The department is understood to have accepted dozens of staff from HMRC to help with the current crisis and is training more people to deal with visa applications. By Wednesday, the Home Office plans to have opened a new office in Lille, 75 miles away from Calais, which can process visa applications from Ukrainians who have travelled to the port. It is also examining funding a travel service from Calais to Lille. Harrington will report jointly to Michael Gove’s Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and the Home Office. Last year, he was reprimanded by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments after taking up a role as the chair of the public affairs firm APCO UK without seeking prior permission from the “revolving door” watchdog. He also set up the Conservatives’ ‘No 10 club’, where mid-range Tory donors socialised with senior politicians in exchange for a £10,000 annual membership. In their letter to the Guardian, the charities said the government shows a “callous disregard” for the UN Convention on Refugees. “By setting up a limited and restricted family scheme [for Ukrainians] and making a vague promise to establish some kind of humanitarian sponsorship programme, its [the government’s] response looks chaotic, heartless and unkind. “At the same time, it is pushing ahead with its cruel nationality and borders bill that will undermine the right to refugee protection and criminalise Ukrainians, Afghans and others who, through no fault of their own, are forced to make their own way to safety. “It seems the government has chosen to send a clear message to refugees from Ukraine and elsewhere that they are not welcome,” the letter reads.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson creates new minister to deal with Ukrainian refugee crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/08/boris-johnson-creates-new-minister-to-deal-with-ukrainian-refugee-crisis
3/9/2022,"A group of independent investigators have called for the reinvestigation of the sudden deaths of 14 Indigenous people in a north Ontario city, after finding that the original inquiries were hampered by sloppy police work and a legacy of institutional racism. The team have examined hundreds of deaths between 2003 and 2017 in Thunder Bay, the largest city in the northern reaches of the province – and one where the police force has long faced allegations of racism within its ranks. In 2016, one of the largest inquests in Ontario history concluded that Indigenous people in the region were overpoliced but crimes against them were underinvestigated. Two years later, a landmark report by Murray Sinclair – a former senator and one of the country’s first Indigenous judges – found significant flaws in investigations into the deaths of nine Indigenous people, as well as a “clear and indisputable pattern” of racism in the Thunder Bay police force. Following Sinclair’s report, the city’s police board was dissolved. As part of that report, a team of independent investigators was assembled to scour additional historical cases. Last week, the investigative team submitted its findings to Ontario’s ministry of the attorney general and the office of the independent police review director. The report has not yet been made public, but the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) and the Globe and Mail were able to view the report ahead of its public release. Of the 14 sudden deaths highlighted in an upcoming report, 10 were women and the ages ranged from two months old to 61 years old. In the cases flagged by the investigative team, documentation was often missing or incomplete. Police investigations were inconsistent and deviated from standards. The investigative team also found cases where coroners failed to attend the scene of a death or even order a postmortem to determine a cause of death. The report determined that pathologists and police were “making premature comments on no foul play and releasing scenes” before a postmortem exam could be done in cases of suspicious deaths. In one case from 2010, a 42-year-old woman was found dead from a possible hanging. Police failed to interview any possible witnesses or obtain video from the hotel where she was staying with her boyfriend. It was later determined the boyfriend had previous convictions for multiple assaults. He was never interrogated by police before he died in 2017. In another case, a two-month-old baby boy was found unresponsive in an apartment and pronounced dead at a hospital. The report found that police were aware of previous abuse allegations against the parents involving another child in the home. Investigators said the cause and manner of death of the two-month-old was undetermined, but if evidence had been properly collected, the death would probably have been investigated as possible criminal negligence causing death. A second report, which will not be made public, identified 25 unsolved cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. The investigative team has called for external review of those cases.",News/World news,Canada: sloppy police work and racism marred inquiries into Indigenous deaths,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/canada-14-indigenous-deaths-ontario-new-investigations

3/9/2022,"Poland has said it will hand over its MiG-29 fighter jets to the US, which is then expected to donate them to Ukraine amid intelligence agency warnings that Vladimir Putin is about to “double down” in his invasion. The Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, said his government was “ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein air base and place them at the disposal of the government of the United States of America”. Poland is thought to have 28 of the Soviet-era warplanes, and has been in negotiation with the Biden administration on a three-way deal to supply Ukraine with air power, on condition that the MiGs would be replaced by newer US jets. The deal has the effect of sharing the risk of Russian retaliation with the US, which will decide how and when to hand them to the Ukrainian air force. “Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities,” Rau said in a statement on his ministry’s website. “Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes.” Rau requested other Nato allies with MiG-29 jets – a reference to Slovakia and Bulgaria – to “act in the same vein”. Poland announced the deal as US officials said the war in Ukraine had reached a pivotal moment, with Russia sustaining severe losses but with Putin determined to press on. “I think the next couple of days are going to be critical for both the humanitarian situation and also for the tide of this war,” Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), told the Guardian. US intelligence agencies told Congress on Tuesday that they tentatively estimated that 2,000-4,000 Russian soldiers had been killed so far, but that Putin would persevere in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance. “We assess Putin feels aggrieved the west does not give him proper deference and perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose,” the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, told the House intelligence committee. Carpenter quoted the Ukrainian foreign minister as saying Ukraine will win – but at what price? “I think that is the question that we’re all asking ourselves, and what can we possibly do to get humanitarian relief to those in need, and to force the Russians to abide by some sort of ceasefire and respect for humanitarian corridors,” he said. But Carpenter cautioned: “I have to say it’s so difficult because the cynicism on the Russian side is just unbelievable.” The CIA director, William Burns, predicted “an ugly next few weeks” in Ukraine, in which the Russian leader would escalate the war “with scant regard for civilian casualties”. Haines said US officials believe Putin “is unlikely to be deterred … and instead may escalate – essentially doubling down to achieve Ukrainian disarmament and neutrality to prevent it from further integrating with the US and Nato if it doesn’t reach some diplomatic negotiation”. Carpenter said that US and allied weapons supplies were still getting through to the Ukrainian army. “I don’t want to get into too many specifics as to how we’re getting our security assistance to the Ukrainians who are using it, but I can tell you that that pipeline is open, and we’re dedicated to giving them what they need to be able to defend themselves,” he said. The Ukrainian government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy has placed great importance on the delivery of fighter jets, but US officials and military experts have expressed scepticism over how decisive MiG-29s can be, particularly as Russian forces have substantial anti-aircraft missile systems. “I don’t want to focus too much on one particular system. Ukraine has a lot of needs,” Carpenter said. “Certainly combat aircraft could help but there’s a lot of other systems that could be useful in terms of degrading Russian air power and preventing the vast bulk of the civilian casualties, which are resulting from long-range fires.” A senior US defence official said that Russian armed forces were stepping up their pressure on Kyiv, with intensified bombing to disrupt life in the capital and possibly lay the groundwork for a full-scale assault. The US assesses Russia has lost about 5% of the tanks, artillery and other military equipment it brought into Ukraine, and that it still has the “vast majority” of its short-range, surface-to-air missiles and artillery available. The US official also said the Pentagon believes Russia has prepared up to 11 tank landing ships in the Black Sea for future amphibious assaults on the Ukrainian coast.",News/World news,Poland to give MiG-29 jets to US for expected donation to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/poland-mig-29-jets-us-ukraine

According to ESPN, Wilson, who led the Seattle Seahawks to the NFL title in 2014, will join Denver in exchange for two first-round picks, two second-round picks and a fifth-round pick as well as quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant and lineman Shelby Harris. The Broncos will also receive a fourth-round pick from the Seahawks. The Broncos have been in search for a quality starting quarterback ever since the retirement of Peyton Manning, while Wilson has been unsettled in Seattle for some time. In Denver, he will lead a talented offense backed up by a solid defense. Shortly after Tuesday’s reported trade became public knowledge, Denver were installed as one of the betting favorites for the 2022 season. Seattle, on the other hand, now have a trade haul that will allow them to build for the future after a period of slow decline that started after their Super Bowl loss to the New England Patriots in February 2015. Earlier on Tuesday the NFL Network had reported that Rodgers has agreed to a $200m, four-year extension with the Packers. The deal reportedly includes $153m in guaranteed money and would lower his salary cap figure for the 2022 season. Rodgers later confirmed he is staying with the Packers but said the terms are yet to be agreed. “Hey everyone, just wanted to clear some things up; YES I will be playing with the @packers next year, however, reports about me signing a contract are inaccurate, as are the supposed terms of the contract I ‘signed. I’m very excited to be back #year18,” he wrote on Twitter. Hey everyone, just wanted to clear some things up; YES I will be playing with the @packers next year, however, reports about me signing a contract are inaccurate, as are the supposed terms of the contract I “signed”. I’m very excited to be back 💪🏼 #year18❤️ If the 38-year-old Rodgers sees out the entirety of the reported contract it is likely he would retire as a member of the Packers, the only professional team he has ever played for. The Packers and Rodgers presumably hope he can repeat the feats of Tom Brady, who won the Super Bowl with Tampa Bay last year when he was 43. Brady retired earlier this year and had shown little sign that age had affected his abilities. Rodgers appears undiminished himself: he was named NFL MVP for the second straight year last season, the fourth time he has won the award in his career. Rodgers and the Packers have had a fractious relationship over the last few years. In 2020, Green Bay drafted his apparent replacement Jordan Love, a move that annoyed Rodgers, who believed he was still in his prime. Rodgers also voiced his frustration with the Packers’ front office last offseason, suggesting he was not given teammates to complement his skills. However, the relationship improved in the following months as the team brought in players such as Randall Cobb, a close friend of Rodgers. It is believed the Packers will keep Rodgers’ favorite receiver, Davante Adams, for the coming season. Whether that is enough for Rodgers to win his second Super Bowl with the Packers is another question.",Sport/Sport,Wilson set for huge Broncos trade as Aaron Rodgers confirms he will stay at Packers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/08/aaron-rodgers-commits-future-to-packers-with-reported-200m-contract-extension
3/9/2022,"In a video address without precedent, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appeared in front of a packed House of Commons. He looked tired, and determined, and painfully human. He was not seeking to persuade MPs with his rhetoric, nor to make a complicated case, he wasn’t there as a supplicant or a showman. He only wanted to know, beyond any shade of doubt, that the world could see what was happening to Ukraine. He didn’t want to be your hero. He could not help but be your hero. MPs are not supposed to applaud in the House of Commons. It’s one of their many alienating conventions, the cause of their hear-hears and other dumb noises. What a powerful shock it was to see the chamber on its feet and clapping. You become so used to politics as theatre, and suddenly the actors are also devastated, also mystified as to what comes next. Zelenskiy took the house carefully through what’s come already. The first day of invasion, they were attacked by cruise missiles. Everybody woke up, and they haven’t slept since. There was something deliberately prosaic about his language, inviting, demanding that we put ourselves in his place and the place of Ukrainians. They’re not superheroes, they had no advance knowledge or special warlike gifts, they didn’t have a plan B for the day, if it turned out to involve cruise missiles. They did what we all would, they woke up, and they haven’t slept since. Day two, their “heroic military servicemen tried to fight”, the Russians demanded they lay down their arms, they carried on fighting. The president’s careful chronology underlined a few things; every day is an atrocity, every day is an escalation, every day is harder. “On day five,” he said, mutedly, “the terror against us was against children, against cities. Constant shelling took place around the country. And that didn’t break us.” The Russian rockets fell on Babyn Yar, 80 years after the Nazi atrocities it commemorates; Zelenskiy’s face was enough to hammer home the gravity of the thematic throughline. And then on day eight, “we have seen Russian tanks hitting the atomic power station and everybody has to understand that this is terror against everyone”. There followed the Nato meeting, the limitations of the international response, even as he underlines his gratitude for it. But the shelling and the rockets are ceaseless, the children and cities are still being hit. There are now 50 children who “would be alive, but these people have taken them from us”. So now, for 13 days, they’ve faced the question, Zelenskiy said: to be or not to be? “Now I can give you a definitive answer: it’s definitely yes; to be.” He thanked Boris Johnson for the sanctions, appealed for support, one great country to another. The prime minister’s response was sombre – “I believe he has moved the hearts of everybody in this house” – with a topnote of something like empathy, something like terror. “In a great European capital, now within range of Russian guns, Zelenskiy stands for freedom.” Keir Starmer praised the president’s courage, pledged support for arms, solidarity, ever tougher sanctions, international unity. Ian Blackford vowed that this would end in failure for Putin, that the world would see him in front of an international court, though the line between a promise and a dear hope, here, was plainly demarcated. Ed Davey echoed his plangent optimism when he called for Zelenskiy to be awarded an honorary knighthood, and hoped to see him in person in the house when the world allowed. Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the DUP, didn’t get the memo of the refugee question being held at one remove and underlined the demands of humanitarianism. The question was skirted, one assumes, because it would feel petty, at such a time, to admit any shard of difference between one party and another. I doubt this question feels petty to 2 million people who have already been displaced. Zelenskiy had ended echoing Churchill: “We will not give up. We will not lose. We will fight to the end, at sea, in the air, we will continue fighting for our land whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests and the fields, on the shores, on the street. “I would like to add that we will fight on the banks of different rivers. And we are looking for your help. For the help of civilised countries.” The variations, the immediacy, brought vividly to life the jeopardy and sadness, the sheer kick in the head of history resurfacing as current affairs.",News/Politics,Zelenskiy brings down the house with his speech to the Commons | Zoe Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/08/zelenskiy-brings-down-the-house-with-his-speech-to-the-commons
3/9/2022,"Apple has announced a new version of its cheapest iPhone, an updated iPad Air tablet and a new powerful professional desktop computer called the Mac Studio. During a livestreamed event on Tuesday, Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook also announced that the firm would begin showing Friday night Major League Baseball games on its Apple TV+ service in the US, UK, Australia and other markets. The new cut-price iPhone brings the “SE” model more up to date with Apple’s latest A15 processor, longer battery life and 5G connectivity The new SE keeps the same look as its 2020 predecessor with Touch ID home button and a 4.7in LCD screen with large bezels top and bottom – a body design first introduced with the iPhone 8 in 2017. The updated phone has an improved 12-megapixel rear camera, but lacks the multiple lenses available on Apple’s more expensive models. What the iPhone SE lacks in modern design it makes up for in value, likely to be supported with software for up to seven years, which is as much as five years longer than similarly priced rivals. Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, said: “Apple’s ability to offer devices with a longer life span, and in some cases with multiple owners over a lifetime, makes its devices more sustainable than those that become obsolete after as little as two years when software and security updates end.” The third-generation iPhone SE will cost £419 in the UK and $429 in the US and will ship on 18 March. Apple also updated its mid-range tablet, the iPad Air. It was last updated in 2020 with slimmed-down design, 10.9in screen and Touch ID fingerprint scanner in the power button. The new 2022 model is made from recycled aluminium and is up to 60% faster than its predecessor, equipped with the M1 chip from the iPad Pro and the MacBook Air laptop as well as optional 5G. The front-facing video call camera now has Apple’s “centre stage” technology, which automatically pans and scans to keep video call participants in-shot without having to move the iPad about. The fifth-generation iPad Air will cost from £569 in the UK and $599 in the US and will ship on 18 March. The new Mac Studio is a small but powerful desktop computer, aimed at developers, videographers and creative professionals who do not want a built-in screen. The new machine is still compact, like the Mac mini, but is now taller with a body made of 80% recycled aluminium. It has Apple’s new M1 Ultra processor, which is essentially two of the previous top M1 Max chips bolted together, making it 60% faster than the Mac Pro. It supports up to 256GB of unified memory and has up to six Thunderbolt 4/USB 4 ports, two traditional USB ports and an HDMI for connecting displays. To go with it, Apple also announced a new 27in 5K external monitor made of recycled aluminium. The Studio Display has an embedded A13 chip, previously used in iPhones, a 12-megapixel Centre Stage camera and three mics for video calls, plus a six-speaker sound system. The Mac Studio will ship from 18 March costing from £1,999 in the UK and $1,999 in the US, but models with the M1 Ultra will cost £3,999 or $3,999. The Studio Display will cost £1,499 in the UK or $1,599 in the US on its own.",News/Technology,Apple launch: new low-cost iPhone SE and Mac Studio desktop,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/08/apple-launch-new-low-cost-iphone-se-and-mac-studio-desktop
3/9/2022,"President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s speech by video link to the European parliament last week was so powerful it brought the English translator to the verge of tears. “Prove you are with us,” he said to leading EU politicians, a clear and emotive call for greater support that laid the ground for his speech Westminster on Tuesday. The Russian invasion has already turned the khaki-wearing Ukrainian leader into the most powerful – and effective – political communicator in the world. The addresses from his office in Kyiv are designed to shift political and public opinion, and they have already had a dramatic impact. A private speech to EU leaders a few days earlier is credited with helping bring forward tougher than expected sanctions on Russia from Brussels. In that address he told the gathered presidents and prime ministers he believed his life was under threat, and from their relative safety in the Belgian capital the continent’s leading politicians felt they had little choice but to step up. Zelenskiy may have got his tough sanctions but they have not turned the tide in the war. Despite a chaotic and messy start, Russian forces continue to menace Kyiv and analysts at the Institute for the Study of War believe the start of attack on the capital could be 24 to 96 hours away. What the Ukrainians want immediately is greater military support from the west, as demonstrated by another speech from the president – a private video address made to 280 members of the US Congress on Saturday. One of those listening was Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, who said Zelenskiy “made a desperate plea” for the implementation of a no-fly zone – or failing that more fighter planes and other advanced military aid. Boris Johnson was in the Commons when Zelenskiy spoke. But he, in common with other Nato allies, has made clear he does not support a no-fly zone, partly because it is feared it could lead to a general war with Russia. “When it comes to a no-fly zone in the skies above Ukraine, we have to accept the reality of that involves shooting down Russian planes,” the UK prime minister said last week. In the end, in a sober speech to a packed Commons, Zelenskiy pitched his request mildly, careful not to embarrass his hosts. The president complained that Nato hadn’t given Ukraine “the result we were looking for” by refusing to implement a no-fly zone and pleaded “find a way to make our Ukrainian sky safe”. On Saturday, Zelenskiy had pivoted from asking for a no-fly zone towards an alternative demand for greater military aid. That would start with a call for Poland and other eastern European countries to supply Russian-made fighter jets of the type Ukraine’s pilots know how to fly. Britain’s role here would be both to help persuade eastern European countries to part with their MiG-29s or similar and help provide replacement air support, and other more capable arms, such as air defence systems – all likely to be needed in the defence of Kyiv. The risk for Britain and the west is that greater rearmament will further provoke Russia, but facing a national existential crisis, Zelenskiy has no time to worry about that. The president did not have to spell out what he felt his country needed: the hint was clear enough – Ukraine was “defending freedom, despite the blows of one of the world’s largest armies” and an “open sky, still open to Russian missiles, planes, helicopters”.",News/World news,What can MPs take from Zelenskiy’s address to the Commons?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/what-can-zelenskiy-expect-as-he-prepares-to-address-the-commons
3/9/2022,"Good morning. Strong winds are expected to cause more chaos in New South Wales today as the flooding crisis continues to affect Australia’s east coast. Tens of thousands of residents across Sydney have been forced from their homes after the floods unleashed carnage and claimed the lives of a mother and son. Farther north, permanent residents in caravan parks have been devastated by flood water, and with many unable to afford insurance against increasingly common inundations, they have no option but to stay and rebuild. “We just get ourselves up, shake ourselves off, and start all over again,” said resident Heather Emmett. State and federal MPs from both sides of politics have called for the planned commonwealth cyclone reinsurance scheme to be expanded to cover floods and fires. Now the clean-up has begun for many flood-affected communities, fears are being raised about the impact of the mountains of waste, with questions over a NSW government plan to store the rotting mounds at a quarry. Russia has been accused of violating a ceasefire by shelling the humanitarian corridor to the besieged city of Mariupol, as the number of people fleeing Ukraine passes 2 million. “The enemy has launched an attack heading exactly at the humanitarian corridor,” the Ukrainian defence ministry said on Facebook, adding that the Russian army “did not let children, women and elderly people leave the city”. It’s not the only incident of Russian soldiers targeting civilians, with multiple allegations of the use of deadly fire on civilian vehicles across Ukraine. The price of fuel and food in Australia is set to rise, economists have warned, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine will likely have unforeseen impacts on the Australian economy. Australia’s relative dependence among rich nations on commodity exports leaves it exposed to sharp swings in international markets. More costly commodities would be noticed at Australians’ kitchen tables and when they head to the service station, with prices predicted to jump to as much as $2.50 a litre for petrol. Anthony Albanese will use a speech at a business summit on Wednesday to bemoan a lost decade of division and policy inertia under the Coalition and present himself as a consensus figure with a “renewal” agenda. Albanese will call for an end to the climate and culture wars and look for collaborative opportunities between governments, trade unions, businesses and civil society around “shared aims of growth and job creation”. The climate crisis is increasing the risk of food shortages “all the way through the supply chain, from farm to warehouse to supermarket shelves”, according to the author of a new report for Farmers for Climate Action. A Victorian man in his 60s has died from the Japanese encephalitis virus, prompting authorities to warn Australians to take the risk of the mosquito-borne disease seriously. The UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, will make a long-delayed visit to China in May, including to Xinjiang, where activists and western lawmakers say Beijing is subjecting Uyghur people to genocide. Influencers, TV presenters and sports stars would no longer be able to advertise unhealthy food and drink to children in Spain, under a new proposal. Octopuses are increasingly using discarded bottles, cans, and other human rubbish as shelter or as a sanctuary for their eggs, according to new study. The US Senate has unanimously passed a bill to make lynching a federal hate crime, after more than 200 attempts failed over more than a century. “I grievously miss (and suspect I always will) the loss of 30 years’ worth of collected earrings,” says writer and commentator Jane Caro, recounting the items she most regrets losing. “Our house was broken into a few years ago and the thief snatched my jewellery box off my dressing table … I have begun amassing another collection, of course, but it’s not the 80s.” Even though the borders are open, in the uncertain soup of the pandemic international travel still remains a fantasy for many of us. So the next best thing may be to watch a television show about people travelling around Europe – like Us, a four-part series streaming now on ABC’s iView. But instead of being the next best thing to a trip to Europe, Us is a nightmare journey, where the viewer accompanies a married couple and their adult son Albie as their family implodes. Many parts of Australia’s east coast are enduring a record wet start to the year, with frequent deluges and storms. In these conditions, mould thrives. And if not dealt with, mould growth can have adverse effects on health. We spoke to the experts on how to prevent mould taking hold, and what to do if it already has. With the federal election due to be called in a few weeks, it’s still unclear who will be running for the Liberal party in some pivotal NSW seats. The stalemate stems from a factional brawl within the state division of the Liberals, and it has led to interventions from the prime minister and the supreme court.

3/9/2022,"The UK’s announcement that it will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year is set to have an impact on consumers already feeling the pain from surging inflation and high energy and fuel bills. The government also said it was exploring options to end Russian supplies of natural gas to the UK, which make up less than 4% of the country’s supply. Here’s what the UK’s move to replace the 8% of Russian oil could do to bills: Household energy bills are already set to go up in April, and the new move could mean bigger rises are set to come later in the year, by putting more pressure on oil and gas prices. Brent crude jumped to $133 per barrel on Tuesday, close to the 14-year high hit on Monday. The good news of sorts for households with standard gas and electricity supplies is that the Ofgem energy price cap that applies to bills stops providers from putting up variable tariffs any time soon. The higher price cap that takes effect on 1 April will be in place until the end of September. The cap will be updated in August, with the new ceiling taking effect from the start of October – so a lot will depend on the state of the energy market at that point. Some experts had already suggested that average annual bills could go reach £3,000, and this latest announcement heightens the chance of that happening. Even if the wholesale cost of gas has gone down by the summer, in the shorter term rising prices will put pressure on suppliers. If more go to the wall, there could be greater costs in the pipeline for customers. Standing charges for electricity are going up by around 80% in some cases in April to cover the cost of last year’s energy company collapses, and if more go bust, the cost of looking after their customers will filter through to bills eventually. For those off the gas grid, the pain will be much quicker to hit home. Heating oil prices have rocketed in recent days – according to the website BoilerJuice, the average price of a litre of heating oil had gone up from 66.77p on 23 February to 117.83p on Monday. A squeeze on global supply will push that up. Gas and oil prices are a big factor in how much we pay for food, and if they continue to go up, so will the cost of groceries. Fertiliser prices have surged on the back of rising gas prices, and will mean farmers need to charge more for everything they produce. Cooking oil prices have already gone up, with one of the drivers being demand for the crops for biodiesel. Soaring oil prices will add to that pressure. Rising prices for cooking oil will have a knock-on impact on all kinds of foodstuffs – margarine, peanut butter and long life cream are just some of the products that contain it. The move will put yet more upwards pressure on prices at the pump, which – it was revealed on Tuesday – have just gone up by the biggest weekly amount for years. The cost of filling up a 55-litre family car has gone up by more than £2 in a week, according to government data going up to close of play on Monday 7 March. “Russia is our biggest source of diesel outside the UK, supplying 18% in 2020 but hovering around 15-20% annually,” according to a report in Autocar. However, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said that “more than two-thirds of our road fuel comes from domestic production”. The new move will be phased in over several months, giving the markets a fair bit of time to adjust, and allowing for alternative suppliers to be found, though whether that is enough to stop motorists panic-buying remains to be seen. The average price of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts rose from 149.2p on February 28 to 153p on Monday (7 March), according to BEIS, while average diesel prices rose from 153.4p to 158.6p over the same period. Rising inflation would usually mean higher interest rates. The Bank of England is tasked with keeping inflation at 2% – however, the annual rate of price growth had already reached 5.5% ahead of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and rising petrol and food prices will push it up further, with some economists predicting inflation of almost 9% by the end of the year. But the Bank will be aware that households face higher costs, and may decide not to pile on more pressure by raising borrowing costs rapidly, as some have been predicting. When it meets next week, it could opt to raise rates from 0.5% to 0.75%, rather than to 1% as some commentators have predicted. If the bank does increase rates, that will add to mortgage costs for those on variable-rate home loans, and could push up the price of new personal loans. Fixed-rate mortgages have been so cheap that most homeowners and landlords have them, and so they will be shielded in the short-term at least from rising costs.",Lifestyle/Money,What does action over Russian oil and gas mean for UK consumers?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/08/what-does-action-over-russian-oil-and-gas-mean-for-uk-consumers
3/9/2022,"Todd Boehly and Hansjörg Wyss have submitted their offer to buy Chelsea but they are yet to convince Roman Abramovich to sell the club to their consortium. Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale last week and is considering how to proceed after receiving an opening proposal from the consortium fronted by Boehly and Wyss. The size of the offer remains unknown but is unlikely to be significantly higher than £2bn. Wyss, an 86-year-old Swiss billionaire, has gone on the record to say that Abramovich’s asking price is too high. It has been reported that Abramovich, who has faced calls in parliament for him to be hit with sanctions since the invasion of Ukraine, is looking for as much as £4bn. It remains to be seen whether the Russian, who is keen for a sale to go through quickly, will accept a significantly lower fee. Beyond the finances, Wyss and Boehly must convince Abramovich, who bought Chelsea in 2003, that they are the right people to take the club forward. One well-placed figure suggesting that Abramovich is unsure about selling to them. Wyss and Boehly, who part-owns the LA Dodgers, are sitting tight as they await a response. The identities of the other figures who have formed their consortium remain unknown. Abramovich, who vehemently denies allegations linking him to Vladimir Putin and the Russian state or that he has done anything to merit sanctions, has appointed the New York-based bank Raine to oversee the sale. Interested parties have been given until 15 March to submit bids. It is unlikely Abramovich would be permitted to sell Chelsea if the UK government imposed sanctions on him. Born in Bern, Switzerland, 19 September 1935. He studied engineering, earned an MBA from Harvard, then worked in textiles in Asia and Europe. As a sideline he sold planes – with one sale introducing him to the co-founder of the Swiss medical device manufacturer Synthes. Wyss went on to found Synthes USA in 1977 and, in 2012, he sold it to Johnson & Johnson for $19.7bn (£14.8bn). What is he worth now? A more modest $5.8bn (£4.3bn), having, in 2013, signed the Giving Pledge set up by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, committing to give away most of his fortune. His Wyss Foundation – focused on environmentalism and progressive, anti-Trump politics – holds over $2bn in assets. In 2018 he pledged to donate $1bn (£751m) to environmental causes.  Any controversies? His financial influence on US politics, as a non-US citizen, has drawn criticism – but he remains focused on pushing an anti-populist agenda. Asked about Brexit in 2019, Wyss told Swiss paper Neue Zürcher Zeitung how voters had been “deceived by populist statements... For the British people’s sake, I hope that there will be another vote when all the facts are on the table.”  So why Chelsea? He hasn’t shared his vision, but the 86-year-old Wyoming resident isn’t going it alone, with the part-owner of the LA Dodgers, Todd Boehly, forming part of a consortium. Boehly, an investor, billionaire and fellow philanthropist, had a solo takeover bid for Chelsea rejected in 2019 and has previously been linked with Tottenham. He told Bloomberg at the time: ""One of the great things the Premier League has is that it’s on a Saturday morning in America. So you have an uncongested time slot that is now fully dominated by the Premier League. When I was growing up, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, but certainly I didn’t know about Manchester United, I didn’t know about Chelsea, I didn’t know about Tottenham. Kids these days are fully aware of what’s the best and the Premier League is the best. I continue to believe there is a global opportunity for the best clubs.” David Hills There has been speculation that Chelsea’s next owners will come from America. Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, is reportedly readying a bid. However Muhsin Bayrak, a Turkish businessman, last week signalled his interest in buying Chelsea and on Tuesday said he would hold further talks with Abramovich’s representatives on Thursday. The uncertainty at Chelsea could have an impact on contract negotiations with Antonio Rüdiger, Andreas Christensen and César Azpilicueta. Barcelona are close to signing Christensen on a free, although Bayern Munich have not pulled out of the race for the Denmark defender. Barça are also confident Azpilicueta will strengthen their defence on a free.",Sport/Football,Wyss and Boehly submit Chelsea bid but Abramovich not yet convinced to sell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/hansjorg-wyss-and-todd-boehly-submit-chelsea-bid-roman-abramovich-not-yet-convinced-to-sell
3/9/2022,"Family members should help loved ones to quit smoking, adopt better diets and stop taking drugs to help relieve the huge pressure on the NHS, the health secretary has said. Sajid Javid urged relatives to do what they could to persuade each other to lead healthier lives so the health service could better cope with the rising tide of illness it is facing. In a major speech on Tuesday, he said families needed to play a key role in preventing ill-health because demographic trends meant the NHS in years to come could buckle under the strain of treating a growing number of older people with several illnesses. The NHS also had to do a lot more to stop people becoming unwell in the first place, he added, and no longer be just a “national hospital service” as a way of tackling its “unsustainable finances”, because its budget was taking up an ever larger share of public spending. Drawing on his family history, Javid said: “When I was around five, my dad was a smoker – a lot more people were back then. I remember standing at the top of the staircase overhearing my mum confront him, saying: ‘If you die, your boys won’t have a dad.’ He never smoked again. “That kind of intervention is more powerful than most of us can imagine. Whether it’s stopping drug addiction or dealing with depression, there’s no more powerful motivating force than family.” Javid said that although his father had died years later of colon cancer, he wondered “if, by stopping smoking in his early 30s, it gave us much more time together as a family”. Conversations with relatives could help people eat more healthily too, he said. In a speech billed as the NHS’s “road to recovery” after two years of the Covid pandemic Javid said that “we must choose between endlessly putting in more and more money or reforming how we do healthcare. I choose reform. I want us to shift to a new mode of operating, one that’s about helping the whole population to stay healthy, not just treating those who show up asking for help.” He pointed out that while health spending accounted for 27% of public spending in 2000, that would increase to 44% by 2024 on current trends, which could not continue. Pledging to make the NHS “fit for the 21st century” he outlined plans for an expansion of personal health budgets, much greater personalisation of care, closer integration between the NHS and social care, and easier access for patients to NHS care, including via the NHS app. But Nigel Edwards, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust thinktank, warned Javid that rising healthcare costs were a feature of western countries the UK was unlikely to avoid. “There is no evidence that cost pressures on the NHS are unsustainable,” said Edwards. “How much of our wealth we choose to spend on healthcare is a matter of political choice. In developed countries across the world, governments are spending more on health services as the population ages and lives with more and more chronic conditions, and it is hard to see the UK bucking this trend any time soon.” The British Medical Association’s chair of council, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said Javid had “omitted the most fundamental element of any recovery strategy, which is tackling the chronic workforce shortages in the NHS”. Javid admitted that the long-term workforce plan that he had asked NHS England to draw up would take a year to appear, despite the urgency of the widespread staffing problems that were blighting every area of care and calls from NHS groups for quicker action.",News/Politics,Javid calls on families to help NHS by pushing loved ones to improve health,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/08/sajid-javid-families-help-nhs-pushing-loved-ones-improve-health
3/9/2022,"The soaring cost of driving in the UK is forcing people to scrimp on food and heating, as turmoil in energy markets puts petrol prices on course to hit a new milestone of 160p a litre. Simon Williams, the RAC’s fuel spokesperson, said the speed at which fuel prices are rising means petrol is on a “rapid journey towards 160p a litre and diesel to 165p”. “Given the speed of increases, drivers could unfortunately see this by the end of the week. As these are averages, far higher prices will be appearing on forecourt totems up and down the country.” The petrol price is linked to global oil prices which have jumped on the back of the war in Ukraine. The price of Brent crude is now above $130 a barrel, having hit $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 when Russia began its assault. We spoke to readers about how the higher price of petrol and diesel is affecting their lives. Bowater drives roughly 1,000 miles a month to and from work and says the high cost of fuel is forcing him to make big changes, including cutting meat from his diet and keeping the heating turned off. “I used to put £24 or £25 [of diesel] in a week and it’s gone up to about £36,” the 52-year-old said. He considered getting a train instead but the journey cost even more, at “£20-odd pounds a day”, and took a lot longer at an hour and 40 minutes, compared with a half-hour drive. “Normally I’ll buy things like beef or chicken or pork – I’ve had to cut it all out, I’m not having meat at all,” he said. “It’s not healthy food that I’m swapping it for, it’s all carbohydrates, which is no good. “I live on my own – I can go without putting the heating on but can’t go without diesel. If I have visitors over, I’ll put it on for them if it’s cold out. I’ve never ever had to do anything like this in my life.” If the price of fuel keeps rising, as some analysts predict it will, Bowater said he may have to think about getting a second job to boost his income. White, who lives with his partner and four children in a rural village, said higher fuel costs meant his family had to drop extracurricular activities for their two autistic children. Between commutes, the school run and supermarket trips, he and his wife drive 300 miles a week. “Every day I drive past, it’s gone up another penny,” he says. The couple, who own two cars – one diesel, one petrol – used to spend £30 a month on petrol “but now it’s £40”. The amount spent on diesel has jumped from £30-£40 a week to £50. “The kids’ clubs and activities have been cut because we just can’t afford to get them there any more,” he said. Using public transport is not an option because his children cannot cope with the crowds and noise. “We don’t go away,” he said of lifestyle changes the family has had to make. “We used to go through to Glasgow to visit my granny. We can’t do that any more because we just can’t afford to take the car out.” The reader, who withheld his name, used to see friends every week but has now reduced that to “once a month or so” to save money on fuel; however, the reduced social contact has left him feeling isolated. “I feel that my mental health is gradually deteriorating as I’m constantly having to think about nearly every single trip I’m making in my car,” he said. “I used to visit my friends at least twice a week and now I’m only seeing them once a month or so.” The 44-year-old has also cut down on shopping trips in an effort to save money at a time when his energy bills are also going up. “I’m feeling the squeeze in living standards already and it’s only going to get worse come April [when national insurance contributions increase].”",Lifestyle/Money,‘We don’t visit granny any more’: the social costs of soaring petrol prices,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/08/we-dont-visit-granny-any-more-the-social-costs-of-soaring-petrol-prices
3/9/2022,"Shell has announced plans to withdraw from Russian oil and gas and Unilever has said it will stop selling its products in Russia, amid an exodus of big British companies from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. The attack has prompted a global outcry and forced bosses to examine their companies’ links to Russia, amid unprecedented sanctions from the US, EU, and UK. Shell and its FTSE 100 rival, BP, had already said they would abandon major stakes in Russian oil and gas extraction projects after pressure from the UK government. However, Shell went further on Tuesday, saying it will stop all spot purchases of Russian oil and gas, as well as shutting 500 service stations, its aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia. It came on a dramatic day for the global energy industry, with the US president, Joe Biden, banning Russian oil imports to the US in order to target “the main artery” of the Russian economy. The UK also said it would phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022 and that it was exploring options to end gas imports. Russia’s oil and gas producers provide a large proportion of the state’s revenues every year. Brent crude oil prices rose as high as $133 a barrel on Tuesday, before dropping back to $126, a three-dollar gain during the day. The response to the invasion threatens to economically isolate Russia and its population, with consumer brands also pulling out. Unilever’s chief executive, Alan Jope, said the company had suspended all imports and exports of its products into and out of Russia, as well as stopping all media and advertising spend in the country. Unilever controls brands ranging from Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream to Dove soap and Marmite – none of which are likely to be readily available in the country once stocks run out. “We will not invest any further capital into the country nor will we profit from our presence in Russia,” Jope said. “We will continue to supply our everyday essential food and hygiene products made in Russia to people in the country. We will keep this under close review. “We continue to condemn the war in Ukraine as a brutal and senseless act by the Russian state.” McDonald’s on Tuesday said it was temporarily closing all 850 outlets in Russia, although the salaries of its 62,000 staff would continue to be paid. Other consumer-facing brands that have stopped sales in Russia include the UK carmakers Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin, while in professional services the UK-headquartered “big four” accountants – Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC – have all said they will shut their Russia offices. They have been joined by a host of US and European companies who have pulled out, ranging from the plane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing to the phone maker Apple and the delivery companies UPS and FedEx. Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, apologised for its decision last week to buy a cargo of Russian crude oil. He said: “We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel – despite being made with security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking – was not the right one and we are sorry.” Shell bought the oil from the Swiss trader Trafigura at a discount of $28.50 a barrel. As the backlash over the purchase grew last weekend, Shell pledged to donate the profits from processing the oil to a dedicated fund. Van Beurden’s apology represented a U-turn from last week, when Shell defended its decision to buy Russian oil as necessary to keep energy flowing through Europe. The company now says it will immediately stop buying Russian crude on the spot market and not renew longer-term contracts. It will also change its supply chain to remove Russian supplies, but said this could take weeks to complete and would lead to reduced throughput at some of its refineries. Shell got about 5% of its crude oil and natural gas liquids from Russia in 2020, the last available figures, to be turned into diesel, petrol and other products at its refineries, and 4% of its natural gas. Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Shell’s apology for buying Russian oil shows just how strong the winds of change are blowing through the corporate world.” The change should help reduce the risk of Shell “ending up in the ethical waste bin,” she added.",News/Business,Shell to halt buying Russian oil and gas and Unilever to stop sales in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/shell-to-halt-buying-russian-oil-and-gas-and-close-all-service-stations-in-country
3/9/2022,"The president of Ukraine echoed Winston Churchill and invoked the fight against Nazism as he made a direct plea to Britain to do more to help his country repel the Russian invasion. In an unprecedented and emotional speech broadcast live to the House of Commons, Volodymyr Zelenskiy channelled Churchill when he told a packed chamber: “We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests, the fields, the shores and in the streets.” Ukraine “will not lose” to Russia, he vowed. Zelenskiy, who received long ovations from MPs before and after his speech, also cited Shakespeare to describe the plight of his country under Russian invasion. “The question for us now is to be or not to be,” he said, according to a translation of his speech, which was delivered in Ukrainian and broadcast live from Kyiv. “Oh no, this Shakespearean question. For 13 days this question could have been asked but now I can give you a definitive answer. It’s definitely yes, to be. “And I would like to remind you the words that the United Kingdom has already heard, which are important again. We will not give up and we will not lose.” Zelenskiy, unshaven and dressed in a dark T-shirt, delivered his speech sitting next to a Ukrainian flag. His echoes of Churchill, the second world war leader about whom Boris Johnson has written a book, will be seen as a direct appeal to the UK prime minister and his party. Zelenskiy told MPs that after nearly two weeks of war, during which time hundreds of Ukrainian civilians have been killed, resolve remained strong. “Just the same way you once didn’t want to lose your country when the Nazis started to fight your country and you had to fight for Britain. Thirteen days of this struggle ... at four o’clock in the morning we were attacked by cruise missiles.” The speech came immediately after the UK announced it was phasing out the import of Russian oil and oil products by the end of the year. Zelenskiy reiterated calls for more UK support, including repeating a plea for a no-fly zone, which Nato countries have declined to impose over fears it could trigger another world war. “We are thankful for this help and I am grateful to you Boris,” he said, addressing the prime minister by name. “Please increase the pressure of sanctions against this country [Russia] and please recognise this country as a terrorist country. Please make sure that our Ukrainian skies are safe. Please make sure that you do what needs to be done and what is stipulated by the greatness of your country.” The speech was heard in silence, beyond two screens playing Zelenskiy’s speech and the muffled background soundtrack of a simultaneous English translation on headsets given to MPs for the occasion. A number of MPs tweeted photos of the packed chamber, a practice – like applause – that is not normally permitted. The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had felt “privileged” to listen, saying: “In history the right things don’t happen automatically – brave people must fight for them.” Responding to Zelenskiy, Johnson hailed a leader “standing firm for democracy and freedom – in his righteous defiance I believe he has moved the hearts of everybody in this house”. “In a great European capital now within range of Russian guns, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is standing firm for democracy and for freedom,” the prime minister said. Saying he would “employ every method” to squeeze Russia with sanctions, Johnson said the UK would continue to supply weapons to Ukraine. “At this moment, ordinary Ukrainians are defending their homes and their families against a brutal assault, and they are by their actions inspiring millions with their courage and their devotion,” he said. Because of Commons procedures, the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, halted the formal business of the day for Zelenskiy’s speech, and Johnson and other party leaders responded with points of order. Responding for Labour, Keir Starmer said the Ukrainian leader “has prompted a world into action, where too often we have let Putin have his way”, adding: “He has inspired the Ukrainian nation to resist and frustrated the Russian war machine. He has shown his strength and we must show him – and the Ukrainian people – our commitment and support.”",News/World news,Zelenskiy invokes Churchill as he calls on UK to do more to help Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/zelenskiy-invokes-churchill-calls-on-uk-do-more-help-ukraine
3/9/2022,"Joe Biden’s decision to ban imports of Russian oil increases the economic pressure on Vladimir Putin – but it is not without risk. On the face of it, the announcement from the White House looks like a bit of a free hit, given the fact that Russia accounts for just 7% of the oil imported by the world’s biggest economy. Three-fifths of Russia’s oil exports go to the EU, only 8% to the US. Even so, Biden is taking a gamble for three important reasons. The first is that a toughening up of sanctions has given another upward twist to oil prices. American motorists were already paying higher pump prices, even before the latest surge in the cost of Brent crude above $130 a barrel and, as the US president admitted, they will soon be paying even more. Oil prices are up by 70% since the start of the year and there is no sign of them coming down anytime soon. The Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy has predicted a complete ban on Russian oil and gas could send crude prices to $200 a barrel. The previous milestone was the $147-a-barrel peak reached in 2008. The second risk is that Biden’s action fractures the western coalition against Putin, which in the first two weeks of the conflict has been solid. While support from the UK (phased in by the end of the year) means the US is not going it alone with its ban, other European countries clearly have misgivings. That is hardly surprising, because the EU gets 40% of its gas and just over a quarter of its oil from Russia. So when Biden said the west remained united in its determination to keep the pressure on Russia, that is not strictly true. The EU, as the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, made clear 24 hours before the US ban was announced, is worried about its energy security and has decided not to follow suit, for now at least. There is no risk of the lights going out in the US; the same could not be said of every country in Europe. This dependency on Russian energy creates a third risk, namely that Putin gets in his retaliation first by cutting off supplies. The EU has announced steps to reduce its dependency on Russian oil and gas, and the crisis could well have the effect of speeding up the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, but in the short term the loss of such a big chunk of its energy supply would result in weaker growth and higher inflation. While high energy prices eventually prove self-correcting because they tend to lead to recessions, the damage they can cause is considerable. UK living standards are on course for their biggest one-year fall since modern records began in the mid-1950s, with the war in Ukraine putting at risk the post-pandemic recovery. All of which makes it important that sanctions work quickly. The longer the economic war, the higher the cost.",News/Business,How the US ban on Russian oil risks splitting the west’s response,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/how-the-us-russian-oil-ban-risks-splitting-the-wests-response
3/9/2022,"The only straightforward part of Shell’s announcement of its intention “to withdraw from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons” was the grovelling apology for buying a shipload of Russian oil in the rapid-delivery “spot” market last week. And an apology from chief executive Ben van Beurden was obviously necessary: the company’s huge Rotterdam refinery may have been running low on supplies, but the obligation was to pay through the nose to secure alternative barrels from west Africa or somewhere. Shell will now cease spot purchases from Russia immediately. Good. The rest of the carefully worded statement, however, was a reminder that Europe’s effort to wean itself off Russian oil and gas is an exercise in how much disruption European governments and consumers are prepared to bear, and how soon. Shell’s disentanglement plan came with two important qualifications. It will be conducted “in a phased manner” and will be “aligned with new government guidance”. In other words, in the absence of formal EU sanctions, it’s up to European governments to tell Shell, and by implication, all oil majors how quickly to disentangle. The company’s timetable imagines “weeks” to remove Russian oil from the European system and “much longer” to withdraw petroleum products (meaning petrol, diesel, heating oil and so on) plus gas in both pipeline and liquefied form. It’s vague on detail, but so is the EU’s own hugely ambitious plan to reduce Russian gas imports by two-thirds before the end of the year. Nothing concentrates minds like a crisis, but the EU is attempting to do in 10 months what would previously have been assumed to take a decade or more. Renewables will be accelerated “at lightning speed”; new sources of liquefied gas will be secured; hydrogen production will be ramped up; state-aid rules will be rewritten. Aside from the extra use of dirty coal, one can only applaud the EU’s determination. By comparison, the UK’s parallel effort to phase out the import of Russian oil and oil products by the end of this year (and liquefied gas at some point) looks straightforward given our starting point of much lower direct dependency on Russia. But it is only realistic to warn that consumers cannot expect a smooth ride. An entire European energy framework that has developed over the past 50 years is being redesigned at breakneck speed. Disruption seems inevitable. There was a hint of what’s to come in Shell’s reference to likely “reduced throughput at some of our refineries”, which translates as a warning of possible shortages on forecourts. At the moment, the messaging to western European consumers has barely risen above the level of gentle hints to please turn down the thermostat. We’re surely going to have to go further on the demand side. In the oil shock of the 1970s, speed limits on roads were lowered to reduce consumption. It may not come to that this time, but, one way or another, a chunk of demand has to be removed. Voluntary measures when oil is at $126 a barrel are easier than enforced ones at $200. Betting everything on the EU’s rapid reinvention of its supply infrastructure is quite a gamble. Mind you, the gyrations in energy markets have nothing on the wild goings-on with metals. Nickel doubled in price on Tuesday to a record $100,000 a tonne, forcing the London Metal Exchange to halt trading on “orderly market grounds”. It’s an old-fashioned tale of a savage squeeze on short-sellers, given extra impetus on this occasion by big trading houses’ self-sanctioning stances towards Russian purchases. China Construction Bank was allowed more time to put up extra collateral on behalf of a Chinese stainless steel billionaire who was caught on the wrong side of the action. Both the state-owned bank and the client will cope, one suspects, but one moral of that story is that some enormous profits and losses will have been made in the past fortnight of turmoil in everything commodity-related. Aside from operating companies hedging their input costs, hedge funds also fish in these waters. On past form, there will be casualties.",News/Business,Pulling the plug on Russian oil and gas won’t be a smooth ride for consumers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/08/pulling-the-plug-on-russian-oil-and-gas-wont-be-a-smooth-ride-for-consumers
3/9/2022,"Even on the night Real Madrid may have wrapped up La Liga, it was all about Europe. On Saturday, the day Paris Saint-Germain were losing 1-0 at Nice, Carlo Ancelotti’s team produced possibly their best performance of the season. Coming from a goal down, they defeated Real Sociedad 4-1 at a noisy Santiago Bernabéu where well after the final whistle the players came back out to greet their fans and a defiant chant went round, a message of hope. “Sí, se puede!” it ran. “Yes, we can!” They weren’t talking about being able to win the league. Having just pulled eight points clear of Sevilla – a lead never overturned at this stage of the season – that seems likely now. Instead, they were talking about being able to turn round the 1-0 deficit from the first leg against PSG. This, after all is the competition that truly measures them and obsesses the 13-times winners of the European Cup. It is the competition that obsesses PSG too of course, the only one that truly appears to matter for a club at the opposite end of the European scale when it comes to trophies. “The Champions League is special, you’re motivated even more and I want to produce a great game, make history and take Paris where they should be,” Neymar said here in Madrid. “What we most want is the Champions League. The excitement and hope will always be there with the Champions League.” If the “unlike Ligue 1”, still less the French Cup, went without saying it was pretty explicit there and also in the words of Mauricio Pochettino, who insisted that “the Cup, the league, and the Champions League are different challenges”. It was even more explicit when the PSG coach added: “Neymar was signed a few years ago to try to win the Champions League: that was said in every press conference and at his presentation.” And that’s before you get on to Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappé. For that to happen PSG must progress here. Neymar is back to help and they lead, which is the good news, as is the fact that they were so dominant at the Parc des Princes. And yet the feeling has shifted, that sense of superiority diminishing and something else building in its place. The conditions have been created for a comeback. “We have to adapt and read what has changed in three weeks,” Pochettino said. “As soon as the game was over the machinery started, those around Madrid and the club started to generate positive feelings, the idea that the comeback is possible,” he added, comparing that with the negativity and pessimism he believes surrounds his club. At one point he noted that he replies to some questions out of “good manners”, the line “I have been patient with you” serving instead to highlight that patience is something he is running out of. “We do know that if we lose there are no more Champions League games,” he said. Perhaps that is the pressure talking, the need to finally win this competition. For Madrid, it is the opposite: even in defeat, they are not defeated, history teaching them there is a way back and offering a lesson they cling to. The idea of a European comeback is built into their identity, as much a story as a statistical reality. Pochettino, though, may have overplayed it and there was a negative spin put on it too when Ancelotti was asked who had more at stake if they lost – him or his players. The first-leg performance was so bad that the initial reaction was not optimistic, consolation found only in it being a single year – next season Mbappé would be theirs. Concern was deepened by two key suspensions too: Ferland Mendy and Casemiro. Toni Kroos is a doubt, with Ancelotti saying: “If he’s 95% fit, he doesn’t play.” “Casemiro is the best there is in his position and Madrid will miss him; for us, obviously it is better he doesn’t play,” Neymar admitted, laughing. As for PSG’s key injury doubt, Pochettino and Neymar said they expected Mbappé to play after he limped out of training on Monday. For all that Pochettino saw Madrid’s wheels clicking into gear, it wasn’t until Saturday that the attitude finally shifted fully. Twenty days without midweek fixtures have helped, allowing for better preparation and fitness, Karim Benzema’s return has too, and there is a solidity about them that was not there before. But it took the Real Sociedad win to really feel ready for this meeting. “After this, Madridismo believes more in the comeback than before,” Ancelotti said on Saturday. “The reception from the fans was nice because their help will be vital.” A call has already gone out for them to gather at 7pm to welcome the team bus, Luka Modric insisting: “The Bernabéu can play an important role.” Madrid’s manager, though, was trying to avoid falling into the trap of making an epic of what will be a special evening no matter what. For all PSG’s dominance, it is only 1-0: for Madrid, that was the best news of all to come out of Paris. “There are lots of key factors in a game like this; the mental aspect is very important,” Ancelotti said. “The team is in a good shape, motivated, calm. We have to be intelligent. We can’t go mad because we have to win the game, not score loads of goals. Maybe we score early or in the last minute; the important thing is to be alive.”",Sport/Football,Real Madrid rediscover their belief as Neymar and PSG set sights on history  | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/real-madrid-rediscover-their-belief-as-neymar-and-psg-set-sights-on-history
3/9/2022,"John Bercow should be barred from holding public office or positions of leadership, a former Black Rod has said, as the former Speaker was found to have bullied staff during his tenure in the House of Commons and repeatedly lied to investigators. Lt Gen David Leakey, who made one of the complaints against Bercow and acted as a witness to others, told the Guardian he had been determined to ensure Bercow’s record was examined fully. Leakey said no public institution should give Bercow a position while he refused to show any contrition for his behaviour. Bercow, who joined the Labour party after leaving parliament, was reported to be considering a run for London mayor after Sadiq Khan’s term is over. Labour has since suspended him from the party. He is chancellor of the University of Essex, as well as professor of politics at Royal Holloway. A spokesperson for Bercow said on Tuesday he had “never sought or wanted” to be London mayor. The independent panel that examined parliament’s standards commissioner’s findings concluded that at least 21 complaints against him could be upheld. It banned him from holding a parliamentary pass and said he could have been expelled from the Commons if still an MP. The panel, chaired by the former appeal court judge Sir Stephen Irwin, said: “The findings of the parliamentary commissioner for standards, which we have upheld, show that the respondent has been a serial bully. His evidence in the investigations, the findings of the commissioner, and his submissions to us, show also that the respondent has been a serial liar.” Complainants described Bercow’s “amazing display of temper”, including claims of mimicking, shouting, swearing, public humiliation and smashing a mobile phone while throwing it at a senior staffer. Bercow said the complaints were from staffers who had resisted his modernisation efforts. “To describe what I have experienced as a kangaroo court is grossly insulting to kangaroos,” he said. Leakey said: “People can redeem themselves and I hope John Bercow does redeem himself. But so far as I am aware, he has never ever said one word of contrition to anyone. He never put in place a process to deal with bullying when he had an opportunity to do so. In my view, that disqualifies him from a role anywhere in public life or in any position of leadership or governance. He is uniquely disqualified.” Leakey’s own complaint against Bercow was not upheld and he conceded there were no third party witnesses, but he gave detailed witness testimony of Bercow’s bullying of other staff to the inquiry. “I would never have taken him through the complaints procedure from my own personal point of view because I couldn’t have cared less about his bullying to me personally,” Leakey said. “I had to think very carefully about doing it while I was Black Rod – it would have been written up as the Queen’s representative taking on Bercow.” He said he had been aware of three people – Angus Sinclair, Kate Emms and Lord Lisvane – who had been treated far worse. Multiple complaints by the three were eventually upheld. “I thought that I would make it very public that I was doing it to try and encourage others who had been bullied to do similar because otherwise he and people like him, was simply going to go on getting away with mistreating staff and other colleagues,” he said. Bercow said the process had been unfair, describing it as “feeble conclusions reached [that] would be torn to shreds in any judicial process”. Leakey said the former Speaker could not complain about a system he had helped to enforce. “He will rail about how unfair or unjust it has been. But he was the Speaker in the House of Commons for 11 years,” he said. “He chaired the House of Commons commission. There were endless reports about bullying. If the process that is in place is a defective one in his view now, then he had 11 years of his own failure to put a proper process in place to blame for that.”",News/Politics,"Bercow should be barred from public office, says former Black Rod",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/08/john-bercow-should-never-again-hold-public-office-former-black-rod
3/9/2022,"Any outbreak of peace between Phil Mickelson and the PGA Tour will need to be instigated by the player. Jay Monahan, the Tour’s commissioner, stated that “the ball is in his court” after Mickelson’s comments about a Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league. Mickelson is in the midst of a break from golf at his own behest but Monahan did not dismiss the idea of suspension for the six-time major winner. “He has said that he’s stepping away and he wants time for reflection,” said Monahan. “That’s something that I and we are going to respect and honour. When he’s ready to come back to the PGA Tour, we’re going to have that conversation. That’s a conversation I look forward to. “I have not talked to Phil since he made his comments and since he said that he was stepping away. I think the ball is in his court. I would welcome a phone call from him. But it’s hard for me to talk about the different scenarios that could play out.” A key intrigue surrounds whether Mickelson will end his break from the game at next month’s Masters, an event he has won three times. The Tour never reveal details of player sanctions. Still, it was notable that Monahan refused to confirm whether Mickelson would have been welcome to feature in this week’s Players Championship had he chosen to do so. “He stepped away on his own accord and he asked for time,” the commissioner added. “He’s been given that time. We don’t comment on disciplinary matters, potential matters or actual matters. But every player is accountable for their actions out here.” Before Monahan spoke, Rory McIlroy had publicly called for the Tour to change their approach about players who breach the rules. “I think transparency and maybe it not being as closed a shop,” said McIlroy of what the Tour should look to improve. “I’ve always felt that a few of the bans or suspensions, I think that should all be announced. I think that should be more transparent. I’ve always said that.” Monahan had opened his traditional pre-Players address with a swipe at Mickelson. “We are and we always will be focused on legacy, not leverage,” he said. The precise status of the Saudi plan, fronted by Greg Norman, remains unclear after umpteen of the best players in the world stated a commitment to the PGA Tour. “We are in a position where no one can compete with what we have,” Monahan insisted. “The PGA Tour is moving on. We have too much momentum and too much to accomplish to be consistently distracted by rumours of other golf leagues and their attempts to disrupt our players, our partners, and most importantly our fans from enjoying the Tour and the game we all love so much.” It has been confirmed Tiger Woods’s 14-year-old daughter, Sam, will introduce her father when he is inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame on Wednesday.

The former Black Rod Lt Gen David Leakey told the Guardian Bercow should never again hold any form of public office. Labour suspended him from the party, pending an investigation. Bercow, who has been banned from holding a parliamentary pass, called the investigation “amateurish” and said he could circumvent any ban by being let in by a “friendly passholder”. Complainants described Bercow’s “amazing display of temper” including an incident where he ordered a staff member to stay seated “then threw the mobile phone right in front of me on my desk and it burst into hundreds of bits and I could feel them hitting me”. In an excoriating verdict on Bercow’s conduct during a decade as Speaker, the independent panel found his behaviour “fell very far below that which the public has a right to expect from any member of parliament”. It upheld 21 out of 35 complaints against him by former staff. Its sanction decision said: “The findings of the parliamentary commissioner for standards, which we have upheld, show that the respondent has been a serial bully … His evidence in the investigations, the findings of the commissioner, and his submissions to us, show also that the respondent has been a serial liar.” The report said: “The respondent’s conduct was so serious that, had he still been a member of parliament, we would have determined that he should be expelled by resolution of the house.” It described how Bercow had approached the investigation, including mimicking one complainant, Lord Lisvane, “on at least 20 occasions” during the course of their conversation with an investigator. Bercow said the complainants had been resisting his attempts to modernise parliament and said the inquiry been “a protracted, amateurish and unjust process which would not have survived five minutes’ scrutiny in court”. But Kate Emms, the former Speaker’s secretary who made formal allegations against Bercow, said she had been “vindicated” and described how it had taken a toll on her life. “The impacts of the one and only genuinely horrible, undermining and consistently upsetting period of my career has spread into all areas of my life. Stress, anxiety and loss of confidence sent me home on sick leave and affected how I saw myself and how I felt I was seen by family, friends and colleagues.” The panel gave its findings after Bercow appealed against an initial report by Kathryn Stone, the standards commissioner. The panel dismissed Bercow’s appeals against those decisions, concluding in one case that he had “been widely unreliable and repeatedly dishonest in his evidence”. As the Speaker, Bercow made a number of high-profile stands against the government’s use of Brexit legislation, allowing a number of unorthodox challenges by MPs. But his final years in the role were dogged by allegations of bullying, including claims of swearing at officials and throwing his mobile phone. The allegations were brought by Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the Commons, and the private secretaries Angus Sinclair and Emms. Leakey’s complaint against Bercow was not upheld but he gave detailed testimony as a witness to other complainants. He told the Guardian: “Bercow has never ever said one word of contrition to anyone. He never put in place a process to deal with bullying when he had an opportunity to do so. “In my view, that disqualifies him from a role anywhere in public life or in any position of leadership or governance. He is uniquely disqualified.” Several of the complainants kept detailed records of the abuse. Sinclair said he was berated and sworn at for answering a press inquiry on members’ pay, noting that the Speaker called him “fucking stupid”. Emms made repeated complaints that Bercow had made personal attacks on her, belittled her in public, mimicked her and brought her to tears. Lisvane also made multiple complaints about being belittled, backed by a senior MP who claimed Bercow would speak “in a brutal and demeaning way, such as: ‘You come here with your privileged background and offer your opinion, but I’m not interested in your opinion.’” The sub-panel of the independent experts chaired by Sir Stephen Irwin, a former court of appeal judge, found that parliament’s bullying and harassment policy was “breached repeatedly and extensively by the most senior member of the House of Commons”. “He has attempted to defeat these complaints by false accusations of collusion and by advancing lies,” it said. Bercow, a former Conservative MP, stepped down as Speaker and left the Commons in 2019. He was later denied a peerage despite being nominated by the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Last year, he announced he had joined the Labour party. In a lengthy response to the report, the former Speaker said: “Parliament is supposed to be the highest court in the land. This inquiry, which lasted a ghastly 22 months at great cost to the taxpayer, has failed it dismally. At the end of it, the panel has simply said that I should be denied a parliamentary pass, which I have never applied for and do not want. That is the absurdity of its position.”",News/Politics,John Bercow found to be ‘serial bully’ and liar by independent inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/08/john-bercow-ex-speaker-banned-commons-bullying-inquiry
3/9/2022,"Nicola Sturgeon has issued a posthumous apology to the thousands of people persecuted as witches in Scotland, underlining that the deep misogyny that motivated this “colossal” injustice is something women today still have to live with. As she responded to a petition demanding a pardon for the more than 4,000 people in Scotland – the vast majority of them women – who were accused, convicted and often executed under the Witchcraft Act of 1563, the first minister told the Scottish parliament that she was acknowledging “that egregious historic injustice” and extending a formal posthumous apology to all those who were so vilified. Speaking during the Scottish government’s debate on International Women’s Day, Sturgeon explained: “Those who met this fate were not witches, they were people, and they were overwhelmingly women. “At a time when women were not even allowed to speak as witnesses in a courtroom, they were accused and killed because they were poor, different, vulnerable or in many cases just because they were women.” According to the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, a comprehensive database of known prosecutions, between the first execution in 1479 and the last in 1727, at least 2,500 people were killed. The moral panic around witchcraft and devil worship that convulsed post-Reformation societies across Europe and colonial America was especially fierce in Scotland, which carried out five times the European average of executions per capita. Sturgeon described this as “injustice on a colossal scale, driven at least in part by misogyny in its most literal sense: hatred of women”. Over the past few years, there have been growing calls for a national monument to commemorate those who died as well as a formal apology for their persecution, and campaigners on Tuesday welcomed “the first formal recognition of this terrible miscarriage of justice”. Sturgeon told MSPs there were three reasons why this generation should say sorry for events that took places centuries ago. “Firstly, acknowledging injustice, no matter how historic is important. This parliament has issued, rightly so, formal apologies and pardons for the more recent historic injustices suffered by gay men and by miners. “Second, for some, this is not yet historic. There are parts of our world where even today, women and girls face persecution and sometimes death because they have been accused of witchcraft. “And thirdly, fundamentally, while here in Scotland the Witchcraft Act may have been consigned to history a long time ago, the deep misogyny that motivated it has not. We live with that still. Today it expresses itself not in claims of witchcraft, but in everyday harassment, online rape threats and sexual violence.” BREAKING NEWS The First @NicolaSturgeon just issued a formal apology to those people, mostly women, convicted under the Witchcraft Act on #InternationalWomensDay2022 .This is the first formal recognition of this terrible miscarriage of justice @zoevenditozzi @madisonmitchel1 Modern misogyny, intensified by an increasingly polarised public discourse and amplified by social media, had a significant impact on women now questioning whether politics and public life are safe environments for them, Sturgeon added.Sturgeon also welcomed in principle the recommendations made by Helena Kennedy’s working group on misogynist abuse, published on Tuesday morning, stating her government would respond formally as soon as possible. She added: “This report matters beyond the detail of the specific recommendations it makes. It matters because it acknowledges and it gives powerful voice to the stark realities of everyday life for women. “It recognises that misogyny is endemic, and that it blights the lives of women every single day.”",News/UK news,Nicola Sturgeon issues apology for ‘historical injustice’ of witch hunts,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/08/nicola-sturgeon-issues-apology-for-historical-injustice-of-witch-hunts
3/9/2022,"Buses and cars have evacuated some civilians from the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy but authorities in Kyiv accused Moscow of shelling a similar refugee corridor meant to allow residents to escape the devastated port of Mariupol. The governor of the Kyiv region said 150 people had also been successfully evacuated via an unofficial route from Irpin, near the capital. The World Health Organization said attacks on Ukrainian hospitals, ambulances and other healthcare facilities had increased “rapidly” in recent days and vital medical supplies were running low. The UN agency said it was working to urgently get medical supplies to Ukraine. Among the supplies running low are oxygen, insulin, PPE, surgical supplies and blood products. The UK will phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022 and is exploring options to ending gas imports, the energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has said. The decision echoes a move by the US, with Joe Biden also announcing he will end Russian oil imports. Meanwhile, the EU said it would end its reliance on Russian gas. The European Commission has prepared a new sanctions package against Russia and Belarus that will hit additional Russian oligarchs and politicians as well as three Belarusian banks, Reuters reports. McDonald’s became the latest western company to announce it was pausing its operations in Russia, after facing a backlash from social media users for not taking a stand on the war in Ukraine. Earlier on Tuesday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, issued an appeal to international corporations to stop doing business in Russia. Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs has reported that 12,000 Russian personnel have been killed in its latest assessment of their losses to date. They said so far Russian forces had also lost 48 aircraft, 80 helicopters, 303 tanks, 1,036 armed vehicles, 120 artillery pieces and 27 anti-aircraft warfare systems. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, says the number of people who have left Ukraine since Russia’s invasion today reached 2 million. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed UK MPs on Tuesday via video link, reiterating calls for more UK support, including repeating a call for a no-fly zone, which Nato countries have declined to impose over fears it could trigger another world war.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 13 of the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-13-of-the-russian-invasion
3/9/2022,"Can China play peacemaker? That is the faint hope now being seized upon by western leaders desperate to end the bloodshed in Ukraine. “It has to be China,” said Josep Borrell, the UN foreign policy chief. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said that “China is interested in stopping this war”. On Tuesday, Xi Jinping made his strongest statement on the war yet as the French president and German chancellor met him virtually, calling for “maximum restraint” and saying that China was “pained to see the flames of war reignited in Europe”. What he did not do was call it an invasion or blame Russia. The bilateral relationship is at its closest for seven decades, since the Sino-Soviet split. Weeks before the invasion, the two presidents declared that it had “no limits” as Vladimir Putin visited Beijing for the Winter Olympics – the only major leader to do so amid a western diplomatic boycott. China has denounced reports that it asked Russia not to invade during the Games as US disinformation. Even if Mr Xi knew that his counterpart planned a full-scale invasion across Ukraine, he surely failed to anticipate the strength of resistance and the scale of the international backlash. But his personal investment in the partnership makes it extremely hard to correct course. European attempts to position China as a mediator reflect the lack of other options, but also the understanding that it is attempting to reconcile three irreconcilable elements: its closeness to Russia; its long-declared belief in territorial integrity, national sovereignty and non-interference; and its need to minimise the fallout it experiences from the sanctions on Moscow. This, rather than fundamental shifts in its position, explains confused messaging since 24 February, and China’s decision to abstain rather than vote with Russia on key UN resolutions. The bilateral relationship is one of convenience, not love. The countries have been adversaries as well as partners in the past. Mr Xi and Mr Putin are alike in pursuing repression at home and a more aggressive policy abroad, and buttressing their regimes with a narrative of their nation’s historical greatness. Above all, they are brought together by their belief that the US – and the west more broadly – is the major threat that they face. China may not have welcomed the invasion – but it has repeatedly blamed the US and Nato encroachment for the crisis, described Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy as an attempt to create a regional version of Nato, and denounced “illegal” sanctions on Russia. The foreign ministry has amplified ludicrous claims made in Moscow’s disinformation campaign. Mr Xi no doubt appreciates that Mr Putin has dragged the Biden administration’s attention away from dealing with China. The new closeness between the US and Europe – including central and eastern European countries that China has been carefully courting – is less welcome. Sino-Russian trade has grown substantially; last year it jumped to a record $146.9bn (£111.9bn). But that is only around half the level of China’s trade with the EU, and a fraction of its trade with the US. It trails strategic objectives. Vaguely expressed hopes for de-escalation are very different to actions to help achieve it. The suspicion is that remarks suggesting Beijing is open to mediation are designed to soften criticism of its support for Russia, rather than reflecting a shift in its thinking. That at least shows that it knows that it too will pay a price for the invasion, economically and politically – a point that European leaders should reiterate. Though expectations of its ability and willingness to act as go-between should be low, pressing China may dissuade it from doing more to assist Russia, and impose limits on a friendship that is supposed to be without them.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on China and Russia: enough in common | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/08/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-russia-enough-in-common
3/9/2022,"There is no data on global plastic pollution that is equivalent to the regular measurements of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere. But as with greenhouse gases, the recent news has been nearly all bad. In 1950, worldwide production of plastics stood at 2m tons per year. In 2020, it was 367m tons (down from 368m the year before due to the coronavirus pandemic). An increase this enormous is hard to visualise. But the 8.8m tons of plastic waste that is estimated to enter the world’s marine environment each year is the equivalent of a rubbish truck filled with plastic being tipped into the sea every minute. So the agreement struck by 173 countries at the UN environment assembly in Nairobi last week was a huge relief. At last, something is going to be done multilaterally about a problem that no government can solve on its own. Without the legally binding treaty that will be negotiated over the next two years, it was hard to see where progress would come from. The announcement was only the beginning of a long and fraught process. The pollution and destruction of nature are material phenomena. As with cutting emissions (or failing to), fine words about plastics are no use unless they are accompanied by strong actions, including mechanisms to ensure reductions in consumption. Plastic pollution is closely linked to economic growth, and changing our way of life will not be simple. But as a statement of intent, and proof that multilateral cooperation to protect our shared environment is still possible, the agreement is more than welcome. Like global heating, plastic pollution is a matter of social justice issue as well as conservation, with people in poor countries suffering disproportionately. As with emissions, the richest countries and companies are the worst culprits. Research for the US federal government last year found that Americans now generate about 42m tonnes of plastic waste a year – more than all European Union member countries combined. Another report found that 20 companies are responsible for producing 55% of the world’s plastic waste. Some are the same companies responsible for fossil fuel production, since plastics are made from petrochemicals. Efforts to clean up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and television footage of plastic waste in an albatross’s nest, have imprinted themselves on public consciousness in countries where these reports have been widely seen. But policymakers’ efforts to tackle the plastic problem have been limited to waste management, including the bans on plastic waste imports imposed by China and other countries, and restrictions in many countries on the sale of single-use plastic items such as bags. Such measures can have localised effects, and influence attitudes and behaviour. But they have not touched the source of the problem: the total amount of plastic waste in the world is predicted to almost quadruple by 2050 and the oil industry is heavily invested in expansion, partly as a means of coping with reduced demand in other areas, as people switch to greener technologies. This has to change. In the words of oceans campaigner Christina Dixon, the “plastics tap must be turned off”.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on plastics: a treaty could stem the tide | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/08/the-guardian-view-on-plastics-a-treaty-could-stem-the-tide
3/9/2022,"Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys far-right nationalist group, has been arrested and charged with conspiracy over the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. Tarrio, 38, faces counts of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and obstruction of an official proceeding, and two counts each of assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers and destruction of government property. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) said Tarrio was scheduled to make an initial appearance in federal court in Miami on Tuesday. Tarrio was not at the Capitol during the insurrection. Two days before, he was arrested in Washington and accused of vandalizing a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic Black church. Also charged with possessing two high-capacity rifle magazines, he was released the following day and ordered to stay out of the capital. According to the DoJ, Tarrio “nonetheless continued to direct and encourage the Proud Boys prior to and during the events of 6 January 2021”. He later “claimed credit for what had happened on social media and in an encrypted chat room during and after the attack,” prosecutors said. Four other individuals have been charged: Ethan Nordean, 31, of Auburn, Washington; Joseph Biggs, 38, of Ormond Beach, Florida; Zachary Rehl, 36, of Philadelphia; Charles Donohoe, 34, of Kernersville, North Carolina; and Dominic Pezzola, 44, of Rochester, New York. “They earlier pleaded not guilty to charges,” the DoJ said, referring to an indictment in December. Tarrio’s arrest followed charges of seditious conspiracy against 11 members of another far-right group, the Oath Keepers militia, which were announced in January. Tarrio and the Proud Boys rose to prominence in support of Donald Trump and through violent confrontations with leftwing protesters. On 6 January 2021, Trump supporters gathered in Washington DC to protest against Trump’s election defeat by Joe Biden. Trump told them to “fight like hell” in service of his lie about electoral fraud. The Capitol was attacked. Seven people died around the riot and more than 100 police officers were hurt. More than 770 people have been charged. The first jury trial arising from the attack, involving a Texas man who was a member of the Three Percenters rightwing group, reached jury deliberations on Tuesday. The DoJ has faced intensifying pressure to more aggressively pursue those suspected of organizing and planning the Capitol attack. In a speech earlier this year, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, vowed to hold accountable all those responsible for the riot, whether or not they were present at the Capitol. In its announcement on Tuesday, the DoJ said: “From in or around December 2020, Tarrio and his co-defendants, all of whom were leaders or members of the Ministry of Self Defense [a Proud Boys group] conspired to corruptly obstruct, influence, and impede an official proceeding, the certification of the electoral college vote. “On 6 January, the defendants directed, mobilised and led members of the crowd on to the Capitol grounds and into the Capitol, leading to dismantling of metal barricades, destruction of property, and assaults on law enforcement. “Although Tarrio is not accused of physically taking part in the breach of the Capitol, the indictment alleges that he led the advance planning and remained in contact with other members of the Proud Boys during their breach of the Capitol. “The indictment alleges that Tarrio nonetheless continued to direct and encourage the Proud Boys prior to and during the events of 6 January 2021, and that he claimed credit for what had happened on social media and in an encrypted chat room during and after the attack.” In August last year, Tarrio was sentenced to five months in prison. He has also been revealed to have previously been an FBI informant. Tarrio has denied organising violence on 6 January.

3/9/2022,"The Duchess of Cornwall came face to face with the actor who played her younger self in The Crown at an event to mark International Women’s Day. The event, a reception at Clarence House, was hosted by Camilla and was attended by a range of women leading in fields such as the arts, politics and business for International Women’s Day. Emerald Fennell, who portrayed her in the Netflix series, was among those in attendance. The Duchess of Cornwall and Fennell were seen to be in conversation for a few minutes, but when Fennell was asked about what the conversation involved, she said: “You know what – I’m going to be very discreet, because if I’ve learned anything it’s ‘loose lips sink ships’.” The Duchess of Cornwall’s speech, which called on women to “share their stories” in order to bring about a more equal world, addressed Fennell directly. “It is reassuring to know that, if I should fall off my perch at any moment, my fictional alter ego is here to take over,” the Duchess said to laughter from the audience. “So, Emerald, be prepared!” Fennell said their meeting was “absolutely delightful”. “She is such an impressive person, it was fittingly nice to meet her today on International Women’s Day because she does so much for so many particularly female-centred charities,” Fennell said. “She’s been in the spotlight for a long time and has always weathered it with a lot of grace and good humour.” She added: “I was nervous I might be thrown in the tower but so far so good.” The event, which marked International Women’s Day, also featured a moving speech by Inna Prystaiko, the wife of the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, in which she spoke about the experience of women during the invasion. While holding back tears, Prystaiko said: “Today there are no smiles and no peace, just horror and sorrow in the eyes of every Ukrainian woman, mother and wife.” She added: “Now we have to count the death toll of our people and watch their frightened, crying children who are forced to flee their native land with their mothers and sisters, leaving their fathers to defend our country.” The Crown has previously faced controversy regarding whether the show was historically accurate, with the former culture secretary Oliver Dowden urging the company to add a disclaimer that the show was fiction.

3/9/2022,"A family have spoken of their joy after a judge ruled that an autistic teenage boy with a rare kidney disease should be allowed a transplant, against the judgment of doctors. William Verden, 17, is being kept alive by dialysis at Manchester Children’s Hospital but it will stop working in 12 months at the most. Health officials took the medical decision that William should not be offered the chance to have a kidney transplant. That led to his family launching a legal case and an appeal for possible donors to come forward after tests showed relatives would not be suitable. William’s mother, Amy McLennan, of Lancaster, had accused the NHS of handing her son a “death sentence”. At a court hearing in Liverpool on Tuesday, Mrs Justice Arbuthnot ruled that a transplant was in the boy’s best interests. “Transplant is not futile,” she said. “Although the chances of that lead to an increase in William’s suffering in the short and medium term, it has the commensurate benefit which is there is a chance for William of long-term survival.” William’s mother said going to court was not something she ever wanted. “As a family we still struggle to comprehend why William’s case has gotten to this stage but this judgment is about trying to look to the future. “What’s happened is in the past and we now need to focus on trying to find the crucial donor who can provide William with the best chance in life.” McLennan said all she ever wanted was for William to be added to the transplant list and have his treatment continued until a donor was found. “I feel it is the minimum he deserves and what any mum would do for their child.” The family’s lawyer, Liz Davis, of the firm Irwin Mitchell, said it was an “incredibly sensitive case which has prompted a really important discussion not only about William’s care but also about the wider issue of providing medical treatment to people with autism and learning disabilities”. Davis said listening to the evidence in court had been tough for the family. “Strong legal arguments were put forward as to what is in William’s best interests. We’re pleased that the judge has ruled in William’s favour and understandably Amy and the family are overjoyed.” William, who is autistic and has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, suffers from steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. The court heard evidence that there was a 50% chance of success. But William’s doctors argued the chance of disease recurrence after a transplant would be nearer 100%. The hearing was told doctors could not agree to a transplant because William would suffer psychological and physical harm from post-operation sedation and ventilation to prevent him pulling out lines and catheters. It was also argued that if a transplant proved successful then William would live a further 15 to 20 years before he needed another one. Toli Onon, joint group medical director for Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust said of the ruling: “We welcome the clarity which this decision brings for William, his family and our clinicians. “The trust asked the Court of Protection to make today’s judgment because of how unusual, complex and risky the situation is. “William has a rare condition affecting his kidneys, and each treatment option had its own risks to his health and wellbeing. That’s why we asked the court to make this difficult decision, and why the judge noted that she respected our approach to establishing what’s best for William. “William, his family and our staff have all worked really hard together to support his dialysis; and we will now be liaising with William and his family regarding how best to progress his treatment.” The court of protection considers cases relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions.

3/9/2022,"The juror in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell who did not disclose childhood sexual abuse during jury selection claimed on Tuesday to have been distracted by background noise, and a recent breakup, when he rushed a screening questionnaire. Scotty David, who was juror 50, made the claims in Manhattan federal court, during a proceeding in which he was questioned about the omission by the judge in the case, Alison Nathan. David was granted immunity to testify, having said he would invoke his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. “I flew through this questionnaire,” David said. “I honestly never though I’d be chosen to sit on this jury.” David said he was distracted when completing the questionnaire at court on 4 November. He had been told to be at court early, he said, and yet “it took 45 minutes to just get through the security line”. A video in which Nathan gave then-prospective jurors instructions was affected by audio-visual issues. Potential panelists wound up completing questionnaires hours later. David said that as he was completing his questionnaire, he heard the shuffling of papers and people asking questions. “It’s super distracting,” he said, saying he just skimmed the paperwork in front of him. “I did not spend a whole lot of time thinking about it.” David also said: “We just sat there for three hours. I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book. I was sitting, twiddling my thumbs, thinking about the breakup that happened a few weeks prior.” Nathan asked David if he took her instructions seriously when he returned to court several weeks later for further questioning. When he said yes, the judge asked him to explain why. “I wasn’t distracted,” David said. “At that point, I wasn’t thinking about my ex.” He also said: “I didn’t lie to get on the jury. If I lied deliberately, I wouldn’t have told a soul.” He added: “I apologize for wasting a lot of people’s time and money.” Maxwell was convicted on 29 December on sex-trafficking and related charges for procuring girls – some aged just 14 – for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse. Maxwell has maintained her innocence. Epstein, a convicted sex offender who once counted elite figures such as Prince Andrew among his associates, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking. He killed himself in a New York federal jail about a month after his arrest. Maxwell’s conviction was thrown into potential disarray just days after her trial concluded. David claimed in media interviews he had been sexually abused as a child and said that he told other jurors about this abuse, which helped them see things from a victim’s perspective. The comments prompted controversy because potential jurors were directly asked about past abuse. One question stated: “Have you or a friend ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse or sexual assault?” Following David’s comments in the media, prosecutors asked Nathan for an inquiry. Maxwell’s lawyers quickly joined in, and have been pushing for a mistrial, arguing that David’s failure to disclose past abuse deprived Maxwell of a fair and impartial jury. David’s completed questionnaire was released during legal exchanges. It revealed that he marked the no box in response to the abuse question. In court on Tuesday, Nathan asked if that was an accurate answer. “No it is not,” David said. “What is an accurate answer to that question?” the judge asked. David alleged that his former stepbrother and a friend sexually abused him when he was nine and 10, on multiple occasions. David said he told his mother when he was in high school, and that she went to police but no charges resulted. David said he had not considered himself a victim of crime when completing the questionnaire, saying this mentality is “part of my healing process”. He answered no on a question about whether a family member had been accused of abuse. Nathan said he had accused his former stepbrother of abuse. David said he did not consider him family. While it is unlikely Maxwell will be retried, it is a possibility. Veteran attorneys told the Guardian that would hinge on David’s explanation for his failure to disclose. An accidental omission poses less of a potential for retrial. However, if David intentionally withheld that information, the possibility is higher. Following David’s testimony, Nathan asked both sides to submit paperwork. She will rule at a later date.",News/US news,Maxwell juror says he was distracted during jury selection but ‘I did not lie’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/juror-ghislaine-maxwell-trial-judge-court-hearing
3/9/2022,"Russia’s surprisingly chaotic attack on Kyiv has seen thousands of troops and hundreds of vehicles stuck on the roads to the north-west for several days – but several military analysts believe Moscow is gradually overcoming its logistics problems and could be able to mount an assault on the capital within days. The influential Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based thinktank, concluded on Monday evening that Russian forces were now “concentrating in the eastern, north-western and western outskirts of Kyiv” in preparation for an “assault on the capital in the coming 24-96 hours”. Its success, the thinktank added, would depend in part on how effectively Russian troops had been able to “resupply, reorganise and plan” after an initial invasion that experts believe fell apart due to flawed assumptions – where the military did not, in the first instance, prepare for a strategic ground offensive against a determined and hostile Ukraine. “No part of the military operation looked rational or what you would expect them to do,” said Michael Kofman, the director of the Russia studies programme at the CNA thinktank. Lightly armoured units outran air cover, making failed attempts to march into both Kyiv and Kharkiv in the first days of the conflict, reflecting, Kofman said, that soldiers were “told they were going to help Ukraine liberate themselves”. What then happened, to the north-west of Kyiv, was that one of the Russian columns heading towards the capital – a vast, 40-mile long force of about 15,000 troops – appeared to become stuck, with vehicles running out of fuel or breaking down. This created a large traffic jam which – because of the limited available roads and muddy surrounding countryside – was hard to untangle. Social media images of military vehicles stuck in the mud prompted one expert to suggest that the Russian army had engaged in “poor truck management practices”, where vehicles had been left parked for so long that the tyre sidewalls had become brittle or had even rotted, meaning they were vulnerable to puncture. But, speaking at an event organised by the Rusi (Royal United Services Institute) thinktank, Kofman said he believed “the logistics problem is oversold” and the problem faced by the invaders was more basic – that it was “extremely hard to undo” the traffic jam problem once it emerged. “Militaries often have to learn problems the hard way,” he added. Gradually, experts believe, Russia has become more careful about keeping its troops within the protection of its air defences – while at the same time, the problems of the north-west, arguably the most direct invasion route to the capital, have not necessarily been replicated elsewhere. Russian forces appear to be advancing to the east of the capital to the suburb of Brovary, according to video posted on social media on Tuesday, in a developing attempt to encircle the capital. And, despite the logistics problems in the north-west, Ukrainian forces have not been able to make a significant attempt to destroy the advancing convoy, partly due the limited air power available to Kyiv’s armed forces. The next few days are likely to be critical. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert at Rusi, said he believed that while the Russian military would not have solved its logistical problems, efforts would have been made to resupply at least part of the invading forces. “The question is whether it will be in sufficiently good shape to attempt to complete the encirclement of Kyiv,” Reynolds said, “given the physical and psychological hammering that their forces have taken while they were in a state of confused disorganisation.”",News/World news,Russia ‘solving logistics problems’ and could attack Kyiv within days – experts ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/russia-solving-logistics-problems-and-could-attack-kyiv-within-days-experts
3/9/2022,"The shockwaves from the Russian invasion of Ukraine will cut UK living standards by £2,500 per household, lead to more persistent inflationary pressure and slow the economy to a standstill next year, economists fear. Following reports of an escalation of the west’s economic measures against the Kremlin, forecasters have cut their estimates of growth in 2022 and 2023 and become gloomier about the outlook for the cost of living. The Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy said the prospect of living standards taking their biggest hit since records began in 1955 would put pressure on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to announce fresh help in his spring statement on 23 March. Based on the assumption that sanctions would have a marked impact on global commodity prices and inflation, the CEBR said growth this year would be halved – down from a previously forecast 4.2% in 2022 to 1.9%. Its growth estimate for 2023 has been reduced from 2.0% to 0.0%, while after peaking at 8.7% in the spring, inflation is expected to remain above 7% until early 2023. “As a result of higher commodity prices, we estimate that disposable incomes will fall in 2022 by 4.8% with a further fall of 1.4% in 2023. The forecast fall in living standards this year is an estimated £71bn – which amounts to £2,553 per household. As a result, we estimate that disposable incomes will fall in 2022 by 4.8% with a further fall of 1.4% in 2023. The fall in 2022 is the largest since records started in 1955.” The chancellor is not currently planning on making his spring statement a mini-budget but the CEBR said he was “likely to be under further pressure to put the economy on a semi wartime setting on 23 March”. James Smith, developed market economist at ING bank, said: “The war in Ukraine and the associated spike in energy costs means a growing risk that the UK will enter a consumer spending downturn. It’s early days, but we have revised downwards our forecasts, and quarterly growth rates are likely to hit zero later this year. [We] will likely see inflation peak close to 8% in April and end the year near to 6%.” Paul Dales, UK economist at Capital Economics, said he now expected inflation to peak at 8.3% in April – up from 8% previously – and be at 6.6% in December rather than 4.6% as previously expected.  The headline and text of this article were amended on 8 March 2022. The £2,500 figure relates to households, rather than being “per person” as an earlier version said.",News/Business,"Russia sanctions ‘to cut UK living standards by £2,500 per household’",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/russia-sanctions-to-cut-uk-living-standards-by-2500-a-person
3/9/2022,"In Auckland a widower considers selling his home to get by; in Whakatane a mature student moves back in with his parents because he can’t afford to rent; in Wellington an early childhood teacher goes without food to pay the bills. As living costs balloon in New Zealand, so too are the sacrifices its citizens are making. Inflation in Aotearoa has hit a three-decade high, driven by an increase in petrol and housing costs. It is showing no sign of slowing – inflation hit 5.9% at the end of 2021, and ANZ, the country’s biggest bank, expects it to continue rising in 2022. The cost of living has grown by 5.2% for the average household within a year. “Everything is rising: groceries, a coffee at the local cafe, a burger at the wee pub down the road ($21), a car service at the local garage, a haircut,” says Wellingtonian Pal Andre Ricard, 49. “Putting living basic costs aside, the cost of rent and buying a house is off the rails … and wages are staying the same.” Walk into any supermarket and the prices of basic items can be eye-watering. For $100 you will get: a dozen eggs, a carton of milk, a loaf of bread, a block of cheese, a head of lettuce, a block of butter, a chicken, a bottle of wine and a box of nappies. Last week, in a blow to brassica lovers, cauliflowers were priced at a $15 a piece. Annual food prices have had the biggest increase since 2011, with a 4.5% spike between December 2020-2021. “The cost of groceries have risen quite rapidly,” Auckland resident Jijo James says. James, 28, says he used to pay $100 for a typical grocery shop before Covid-19 lockdowns, but a similar bundle now costs between $180 and $200. “I have stuck to buying only essential items and cut down on extra expenses,” he says. Bills like internet and electricity have also increased, James says. “But my income has remained the same, making it harder to save up for any potential emergencies. I went from being able to save some money every week to living pay cheque to pay cheque.” In a draft report last year, the Commerce Commission found New Zealand shoppers face some of the most expensive groceries in the OECD. The commission also found that profit margins at New Zealand supermarkets – which is dominated by a duopoly – were consistently higher than those of grocery chains internationally. The two big supermarket companies – Foodstuffs and Woolworths NZ – dominate wholesaling and distribution, which creates difficulties for other businesses to get competitively priced wholesale supplies. On Tuesday, the Commerce Commission revealed its final recommendations for what must be done to improve competition and affordability. It stopped short of breaking up the duopoly and forcing them to sell off some of their stores, opting instead for making more land available for new grocery stores by changing planning laws to free up sites. The competition regulator also called for the big players to improve access to wholesale supplies and prices for smaller players, and recommended the creation of a grocery sector regulator and dispute resolution scheme to resolve wholesale and supplier disputes. Anna Rawlings, chair of the Commerce Commission, said “competition in this sector is not working well for consumers”. “We think that the best way to improve conditions for competition is to enable the entry and extension of others within the sector by freeing up land for development, and by providing some further wholesale access to grocery supply.” The consumer affairs minister, David Clark, said the government would implement the recommendations. “New Zealanders are demonstratively paying too much in the checkout,” he said. “If we’re not seeing material changes in the sector then we will consider other measures.” Groceries are not the only area where people are feeling the pinch. Housing affordability is at a record low, with the average property now worth 8.8 times the average household income, according to property analysts CoreLogic. For those households, it would take nearly 12 years to save enough money for a deposit. Rent and household bills have also increased. Median rents nationwide have reached $540 a week, up by $50 from the previous year, while utilities rose 32% in the June 2021 quarter and petrol prices increased 30% in the year to December. Melanie Watterson, a 31-year-old from Wellington who is studying full-time and working part-time as an early childhood teacher, says the living costs are “overwhelming”. “To make sure I have power and household bills covered I’m left with very little, and often have to go without eating,” she says. “Managing financially when I was working full-time was difficult and since becoming a student one year ago it has become unmanageable. It’s very overwhelming.” When winter rolls around, those costs become “ten times harder”, she says. “Homes in New Zealand are often unhealthy, poorly insulated and have mould issues, so power bills end up being huge.” For Joshua Mainwaring in Whakatane, his income could cover his rent but not much else. “I like so many thirtysomethings have caved and ended up back with my parents,” he says. “I have been planning to go to university in Wellington but the cost of rent is so high there that I’m having to take a year off first to save money towards my living costs.” Even homeowners are struggling. Keith Marshall, a 74-year-old retiree and widower in Auckland, says he is of the generation that is “asset rich but cash poor”. His superannuation has increased marginally in the past few years, but not at a rate to match the rise in living costs. “I am not talking about daily coffees, brunches, dining out, takeaway food, online streaming services or buying the latest thing to have on a credit card,” he says. “I can afford none of those things. My one social outing per week is to see a film at a senior citizen’s rate.” Marshall monitors his spending thoroughly using spreadsheets but is still left with nothing at the end of the pay period. “Unfortunately, if this rate of inflation continues or grows, I cannot see how I can continue to live as I do now. What that may entail I dread to contemplate.” Over the weekend, the National party promised to scrap the government’s tax policies to help soften the blow of increasing costs of living, which its leader Christopher Luxon called a “crisis”. “The average kiwi family is worse off than they were 12 months ago and the government needs to act.” But the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, rejected the idea that New Zealand was in a rising costs crisis, saying global pressures were leading to high prices, not government policies. “Yes, these times are tough. We have seen the impact of inflation, but we have also seen people predict we’ll be coming out of that throughout this year. Things will start to get better and ease,” she told Newshub. “We are experiencing high inflation, as are many countries at the moment.”",News/World news,‘Everything is rising’: New Zealanders make painful sacrifices as living costs skyrocket,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/everything-is-rising-new-zealanders-make-painful-sacrifices-as-living-costs-skyrocket
3/9/2022,"Britain and the US together moved to ban Russian oil in the biggest financial crackdown on Moscow since its invasion of Ukraine two weeks ago. In a move likely to hit the Kremlin’s coffers hard, as well as further raising petrol prices and feeding inflation in the west, Boris Johnson said stopping imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022 was “another economic blow to the Putin regime”. Joe Biden announced a joint ban on Russian oil and gas imports, while the EU presented a plan to phase out gas imports only. “Today I’m announcing the United States is targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy,” President Biden said in an address at the White House. “We’re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy. That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports, and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine.” The sanctions are expected to be highly damaging to the Russian economy, with experts at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit saying the UK oil ban alone could cost Moscow more than £5bn this year. The EU sources about 40% of its gas from Russia and 27% of its oil, while the US gets no gas from Russia and 7% of its oil. In Britain, 4% of gas and 8% of oil comes from Russia. Analysts said the crackdown was expected to push up the price of fuel, with petrol already hitting a record 155p a litre this week in the UK, 24% higher than a year ago. Conservative MPs are clamouring for a reduction in fuel duty in this month’s spring statement as a result. Johnson said consumers would be protected and the government said the transition to new suppliers of oil would be “smooth”, implying motorists have no need to queue at the pumps in a repeat of the autumn’s panic over fuel. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said the UK imports 13% of its diesel from Russia, and none of its petrol. Johnson said: “We can certainly do it … in a way that doesn’t disrupt supply, that ensures we have substitute supplies on stream in an orderly way and in a timetable that won’t affect UK business, won’t affect UK manufacturing, road haulage or other parts of our industry but will punish the regime of Vladimir Putin.” But Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “With supply constrained, while demand rockets for supplies from elsewhere in the world, it seems the only way is up for energy prices.” She added: “There is no magic wand to wave to speed up the shift to renewables, and although the EU has pledged to accelerate the process of weaning member countries off Russia, it’s going to be a hugely difficult and expensive transition.” Analysts at Credit Suisse warned that if oil hit $160 a barrel, it could drive inflation to 9.5% by October and push the UK into recession. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will come under pressure to take fresh action to protect consumers from the cost of living squeeze, with higher oil prices having an impact across the economy. Announcing the plan, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, said he would establish a “taskforce for oil” to help companies. He said that the UK is a significant producer of oil, and alternative suppliers included “reliable partners such as the US, Netherlands and the Gulf”. Kwarteng also said he was “exploring options” for a total ban on Russian gas. The government said Russian oil supplies would be “quickly” replaced by other suppliers as its products are already being ostracised by the market: nearly 70% of Russian oil currently struggles to find a buyer. Labour backed the move. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: “It is the right decision to ban imports of Russian oil. We need to do everything possible to isolate the Putin regime.” BEIS is soon expected to publish an updated energy supply strategy including accelerated investment in renewables and a new round of North Sea licences to maximise extraction. However, ministers remain deeply sceptical about fracking, which some Tories would like to see go ahead as the UK strives for energy independence. Jacob Rees-Mogg, minister for Brexit opportunities, signalled support for a change in policy on Tuesday. He called shale gas “very clean” and appeared to dismiss concerns about tremors caused by drilling, saying: “Some of the seismic effects are ones that can only be measured with sophisticated equipment. Others are equivalent to a bus passing by your house, assuming there’s a pavement in between you and the house. And as I say, it’s not the San Francisco earthquake.” A BEIS source said fracking would not be restarted “until there is compelling scientific evidence that allows us to predict and manage earthquakes associated with it”. Some MPs in favour of fracking said it was possible the government could announce fresh research on its impact if they wanted to show it was being kept on the table. The prime minister’s announcement of a ban on Russian oil was relatively abrupt given his comments on Monday that the west would have to take a phased approach to reducing reliance on Moscow’s oil and gas. European countries including Germany, which is much more heavily reliant on Russian gas in particular, have been reluctant to move rapidly towards phasing it out.",News/World news,UK to phase out Russian oil imports by 2023 and explore ending gas imports,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/no-10-plans-cut-russian-fossil-fuels-use
3/9/2022,"An independent inquiry has called the former House of Commons Speaker John Bercow a “serial bully” and liar, saying it would have recommended his expulsion from the Commons had he been an MP. Bercow has been suspended from the Labour party over the conclusions of the inquiry, which came after his appeal against a report from the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone. Campaigners and trade unions have hailed the report as a mark of progress for parliament’s complaints procedure, but Bercow called it a “kangaroo court” and said its findings were “amateurish”. The independent panel, chaired by former court of appeal judge Sir Stephen Irwin, upheld 21 out of 35 complaints against him by former staff and colleagues. Four made complaints, of which three had multiple complaints upheld and the fourth was judged to be a witness to bullying behaviour. The respondent’s conduct was so serious that, had he still been a member of parliament, we would have determined that he should be expelled by resolution of the house. As it is, we recommend that he should never be permitted a pass to the parliamentary estate. In relation to one complainant in particular, the panel found: [Bercow] has been widely unreliable and repeatedly dishonest in his evidence. He has attempted to defeat these complaints by false accusations of collusion and by advancing lies. It found there were denials, lack of any remorse and “repeated publicity in breach of the confidentiality of the process” including in Bercow’s autobiography. Three senior House of Commons staff made complaints against Bercow, as well as the former Black Rod, David Leakey, who was a witness. A former naval captain, Sinclair was Speaker’s Secretary under the previous Speaker and continued under Bercow until 2009 when he retired. He made seven allegations of bullying, of which four were upheld. The report concluded that Sinclair had been verbally abused and berated, with Bercow seeking to humiliate him in front of others. The most egregious display was described by the report as Bercow hurling a mobile phone at Sinclair over a disagreement about his use of the Speaker’s residence during the local elections – though Bercow later apologised. He ordered me to stay seated, so he was standing over me, and then threw the mobile phone right in front of me on my desk and it burst into hundreds of bits and I could feel them hitting me. It was the most violent, extraordinary display of temper. In another case, where Bercow was displeased with one of Sinclair’s responses to a press call, Sinclair said he was “berated for doing so and sworn at”. The Speaker calling him ‘fucking stupid’ and saying that he (the Speaker) did not give a ‘flying fuck’. In another case, Bercow is said to have cut short a meeting with the CEO of the UK’s Commonwealth Parliamentary Association claiming that Sinclair had not briefed him and criticised him in front of the CEO. He is also said to have told Sinclair “you fucking fix it that I’m on that panel” to choose the Speaker’s chaplain after it became clear his favoured candidate might not get the post. Sinclair described Bercow as being “furious beyond the normal reaction … swearing at the complainant, thumping the table and waving his arms, with spittle coming from his mouth”. Emms was Sinclair’s successor as Speaker’s Secretary and made seven allegations of bullying and harassment, of which three were upheld. Emms said her treatment in post made her seriously unwell through stress and anxiety, and she finally quit without notice. Her first complaint, about a work trip to Kenya, came after she warned Bercow he had an item in his hand luggage which would have to be checked in, describing his reaction as “irascible and disproportionately rude and threatening in his body language”, shouting at her in public. In another meeting, where there was a misunderstanding over a policy line, Emms described Bercow looking at her “as if he wanted to rip my guts out”. She described his response as “loud, insulting, personally abusive and a ‘really direct personal attack’. In the course of this attack, he mimicked Emms.” Emms said in a statement she was “supremely glad to be vindicated” by the report. The impacts of the one and only genuinely horrible, undermining and consistently upsetting period of my career has spread into all areas of my life. Stress, anxiety and loss of confidence sent me home on sick leave and affected how I saw myself and how I felt I was seen by family, friends and colleagues. Lisvane, who was then Sir Robert Rogers, was Clerk of the House until August 2014. He made 18 allegations of bullying and/or harassment against Bercow, of which 14 were upheld and two were concluded to be harassment. He said there were numerous fallings out over Bercow’s drive for diversity, including times when Bercow accused him of being “duplicitous, manipulative, of lying, and of bullying”. Another complaint detailed occasions describing Lisvane “personally as useless or hopeless, sometimes with profane language such as ‘fucking useless’.” A witness said that Lisvane was seriously undermined “often in front of junior staff”. He would refer to the complainant as being ‘posh’ and would belittle him in front of others … often mimicking him in a demeaning way or referring to his privileged background. At another meeting, Lisvane said that in front of others Bercow “suddenly launched an attack on his role as chief executive saying that the Commission made a mistake in appointing him and that he wanted to see his roles separated, with the appointment of a BAME woman as chief executive. [Bercow] sneered at the complainant, told him how hopeless he was and that he was not prepared to put up with white middle-aged men any more. In another incident, Lisvane discussed a BBC programme about MPs bullying staff where he suggested the House could not intervene. He described Bercow as going into “rant mode” and saying he wanted to avoid responsibility. The report found “this ‘rant’ was timed by the complainant as lasting 13 minutes”. Leakey, the former Black Rod, lodged his own complaint against Bercow, which was not upheld. But Leakey said he made the complaint, which he acknowledged had no third-party corroboration, because he was keen to encourage those who had experienced worse to come forward. But the report referred to him as a witness of a disagreement between Lisvane and Bercow on a security issue, including Bercow saying: “That’s typical of you clerks. The first sign of big trouble and you’ll head for cover and leave me to hold responsibility.” Leakey is described as recalling the interaction as “extraordinarily rude, unkind and quite brutal”. I’m sure you’ll find some slippery way of getting out of this. You clerks always do. Bercow has denied all of the allegations of bullying and alleged there has been a coordinated attempt to assassinate his character and that the investigations have failed to follow due process. The panel found that Bercow “does not accept the findings we have made and does not acknowledge the impact of his behaviour. In our view he has little or no insight into the way he behaved or its consequences. He has sought to minimise the outcome for these complainants.” In one extraordinary paragraph, the investigator reveals Bercow mimicked Lisvane “on at least 20 occasions” during the course of their conversation. The former Speaker said that misconduct claims against him had been upheld even when witnesses testified that they had not taken place. He said complainants had opposed his reforms for parliament to make the Commons more inclusive and diverse. Parliament is supposed to be the highest court in the land. This inquiry, which lasted a ghastly 22 months at great cost to the taxpayer, has failed it dismally. At the end of it, the panel has simply said that I should be denied a parliamentary pass which I have never applied for and do not want. That is the absurdity of its position. Bercow said he could still attend debates in parliament “with the help of a friendly passholder or go as a member of the public”. He said the evidence against him “would have been thrown out by any court in the land since it is based on the flimsiest of evidence, rooted in hearsay and baseless rumour, and advanced by old-school dogmatists once intent on resisting change at all costs and now settling some ancient scores with me”.",News/Politics,‘Rude and threatening’: the main findings of the John Bercow bullying inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/08/rude-and-threatening-the-main-findings-of-the-john-bercow-bullying-inquiry
3/9/2022,"Car manufacturers are facing soaring costs and supply issues after the price of nickel doubled to record levels in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Prices passed $100,000 (£76,000) a tonne – driven up by buyers racing to cover short positions – before the London Metal Exchange (LME) suspended trading in nickel for the day. Nickel is a crucial element in the production of electric vehicle batteries, as well as of stainless steel, and about 10% of the world’s nickel comes from Russia. While the export of metals has not yet been the target of western sanctions, uncertainty over future supply has also helped push up the cost of aluminium, needed in the bodywork of cars, and palladium, used in catalytic converters, to record levels. The LME, one of the major commodity exchanges worldwide, said it had taken the decision to stop nickel trading “on orderly market grounds” as panic ensued, and said the suspension could last several days. Nickel prices quadrupled in the past week as traders digested the impact of the crisis on metal supplies. The Moscow-headquartered Nornickel, which mines metals in northern Siberia, is the world’s largest supplier of refined nickel suitable for batteries, as well as of palladium. The commodity prices threaten to drive up the price of electric vehicles, with affordability already an issue for consumers, at a time when the running cost of EVs is also rising steeply due to energy bills inflating faster even than pump prices. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the “immediate future was unclear” and it was working with the government and its members to understand and address the long-term impacts of the situation. The SMMT’s chief executive, Mike Hawes, said: “Russia and Ukraine produce some key raw materials for the European automotive supply chain, including aluminium, palladium and nickel, which is used in battery manufacturing. “Rising metal costs add further risk into global supply chains already impacted by inflationary pressures, component shortages and energy price rises. UK vehicle makers are highly adaptable, but commodity prices are often set on international markets and volatility is expected for some time.” Last week the Stellantis boss, Carlos Tavares, warned of “an escalation of cost that comes from raw materials and energy, that is going to put more pressure on the business model”. A VW spokesperson said it had hedging contracts in place that would give some protection against short-term surges in raw material prices. The price of nickel had already hit what were then record levels at the start of the year – albeit only 15% of the latest peak – as surging demand for electric cars left manufacturers vying for raw materials. A year ago, Tesla’s Elon Musk highlighted the potential scarcity of metals for electric car manufacturing, tweeting: “Nickel is our biggest concern for scaling lithium-ion cell production.” The crisis has escalated manufacturer’s issues after a year in which shortages of chips, or semiconductors, hit production. Disruption to the Ukrainian automotive industry, which employs about 60,000 people and is a key supplier of certain parts to German companies, could exacerbate the shortages, some analysts warned.",News/Business,Carmakers face higher costs and supply issues as price of nickel soars,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/carmakers-face-higher-costs-and-supply-issues-as-price-of-nickel-soars
3/9/2022,"My former teacher Barbara Hibbert, who has died aged 64, was head of history at Harrogate grammar school in Yorkshire. She was an inspiring teacher, and ambitious for her pupils, many of whom credit her with setting them on their careers. I am not sure that I would have become a political journalist without her encouragement.Born in Oldham to Elsie (nee Ward), a secretary, and Denys, an electrician, Barbara went on a scholarship to Hulme grammar school for girls, before studying history at Leeds University. She was in some respects on the traditionalist wing of the profession: she thought the job was to instil deep historical knowledge rather than just teach transferable skills, and she encouraged her pupils to read widely. She believed in rigour, and favoured essay-writing, debating and so on, an approach that would become orthodox towards the end of her career.Above all, she was a champion of teachers’ autonomy, and sought to shield her staff from the micromanagement and bureaucracy that piled up under governments of all colours. Returning to Leeds for a PhD, she examined how well sixth forms prepared pupils for studying history at university. Often, she concluded, not very well: not the fault of teachers so much as a curriculum that incentivised cramming for examinations over independent thought.Barbara was an energetic organiser of learning outside the classroom: her pupils enjoyed a cycle of visiting speakers, essay prizes, conferences and trips. She was a believer in state education (despite the name, the school had become a comprehensive in the 1970s), but could be frustrated by complacency and drift. As she saw it, independent schools got the best of everything because they asked, and it fell to her to do the asking. She was particularly passionate about university admissions. Her colleagues recall she was similarly ambitious for her staff, many of whom have gone on to be leaders in the profession.Barbara was a loyal Guardian reader. Her classroom walls carried the cartoons of Steve Bell and pieces cut from the comment pages. She would come to despair of Brexit, and the state of the Labour party.After leaving Harrogate grammar in 2010, Barbara was a consultant to the charity Teach First, mentoring and supporting graduates to create a new generation of outstanding history teachers; and to Cambridge Assessment, the exam board. She was made an honorary fellow of the Historical Association, a charity, in 2012. Barbara was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer in 2014. She survived many years past the expected lifespan, continuing her consultancy throughout. Typically she became an expert in her own illness, participating in several academic research projects at Leeds University as an “expert patient”, alongside spending her commuted teacher’s pension in Michelin-starred restaurants. “I keep plodding on. Am officially an outlier now,” she emailed last October.

3/9/2022,"Attorneys for Britain’s Prince Andrew and his accuser Virginia Giuffre on Tuesday filed with a federal judge in New York formal notice to dismiss the lawsuit between them, as both parties have officially settled the case. Last month, Andrew agreed to settle the civil suit filed by Giuffre regarding allegations of sexual assault. The payment was not disclosed but was thought to be between $13m and $15m. The stipulation of dismissal filed on Tuesday said that both parties “hereby stipulate to the dismissal of this action, with prejudice”, adding that each party would “bear her/his own costs and fees”. Giuffre alleges she met Andrew through the late sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein, and his sometime girlfriend, the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Giuffre alleged the prince sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly and strenuously denied the allegations. The settlement announced in February made no admission of guilt. The settlement also stated that Andrew had “never intended to malign Ms Giuffre’s character” and said he recognized she had “suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks”. The settlement also said Andrew would make a “substantial donation” to Giuffre’s charity in support of sexual assault victims. In 2009, Epstein and Giuffre settled a civil lawsuit for $500,000. Giuffre accused Epstein of trafficking her to Andrew. In January, Andrew was completely removed from official royal life.
