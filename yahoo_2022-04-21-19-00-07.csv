4/21/2022,"The FAA revoked the private pilot certificate of a YouTuber after he was found to have crashed a plane on purpose. Trevor Jacob, 28, was accused online of faking a plane crash last year to get views and likes. After the crash, he had ""recovered and then disposed of the wreckage,"" the FAA said, per The Times. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has revoked the private pilot certificate of a YouTube influencer pilot after determining that he crashed his plane on purpose for a video, The New York Times reported. ""You demonstrated a lack of care, judgment and responsibility by choosing to jump out of an aircraft solely so you could record the footage of the crash,"" the agency said in a letter to YouTuber Trevor Jacob on April 11, per the news outlet. ""Your egregious and intentional actions on these dates indicate that you presently lack the degree of care, judgment and responsibility required of a certificate holder."" Jacob, who has around 133,000 YouTube subscribers, had been under investigation after he was accused of staging a plane crash so that he could make a video about it for views. In the video ""I Crashed My Plane"" posted last December, the 28-year-old can be seen parachuting out of a civilian aircraft — which he said experienced engine failure — while flying over the Los Padres National Forest in California. The video was immediately met with skepticism from aviation enthusiasts, who questioned if the crash was a real accident. The FAA agreed that it seemed odd that Jacob was wearing a parachute in the first place, the Times said. In its letter to Jacob seen by The Times, the FAA added: ""During this flight, you opened the left side pilot door before you claimed the engine had failed."" Jacob also made no attempt to contact air traffic control on the emergency frequency, did not attempt restarting the engine, and did not look for a place to land, ""even though there were multiple areas within gliding range in which you could have made a safe landing,"" the agency said, according to The Times. Following the crash, he ""recovered and then disposed of the wreckage,"" the FAA continued. On Wednesday, Jacob did not appear to be aware of the FAA's ruling, telling the Times in an email: ""Where'd you get that information?"" Neither he nor the FAA immediately responded to Insider's request for comment.

4/21/2022,"BRENTWOOD — A former New Hampshire teacher of the year finalist is facing felony charges, accused of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old student last year in what is the first criminal case brought under a new state law. Bridgette Doucette-Howell, 38, of Merrimack, was indicted on three counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault for allegedly engaging in intercourse, and one count of felonious sexual assault for allegedly kissing the student between April 26 and May 13, 2021, in Kingston and Exeter. The criminal case tests a new legal provision, known as the Howie Leung Loophole Law, intended to prevent those holding positions of authority from engaging in any kind of sexual contact with students, even if the student is not a juvenile and out of school at the time. Rockingham County Attorney Patricia Conway said if there is a conviction, the maximum sentence for each aggravated felonious sexual assault offense is 10 to 20 years in prison. The felonious sexual assault penalty carries a 3 ½ to 7-year sentence, according to the indictment.

She is currently free on personal recognizance bail, conditioned on her having no contact with the alleged victim and having “no unsupervised contact with children under 18 except her own.” Kurt Olson, one of Doucette-Howell’s attorneys, declined to comment on details of the case, except to say his client “continues to maintain her innocence of all charges.” According to published reports, when the alleged crimes took place, Doucette-Howell was working at Sanborn Regional High School in Kingston as a drama coach, her connection with the school on a limited basis for its theater arts extracurricular activity. Sale pending: Hampton Beach’s Ron’s Landing announces closure After the indictments were handed down by a grand jury, her teaching license was suspended by the Department of Education. A University of New Hampshire graduate with both a bachelor's and a master’s degree, Doucette-Howell was a New Hampshire Department of Education Teacher of the Year finalist in 2016 for her years of work as a special education teacher at Regional Services and Education Center, private schools in Amherst and Deerfield. Doucette-Howell is the first person charged under House Bill 1240, also known as the Howie Leung Loophole Law. The law was signed by Gov. Chris Sununu in July 2020, and it went into effect in January 2021. The new provision makes it a felony to engage in sexual activity ""when the actor is an employee, contractor, or volunteer at a primary or secondary educational institution and the victim is a student and up to 10 months after the student's graduation or departure.” Restaurant news: Street ready to open 2nd location in Exeter. Yes, Portsmouth favorites are on menu. The intent of the provision concentrates on the influence authority figures have on relationships with students instead of the student’s age, since 18-year-olds are considered legal adults in most forums. The bill was filed by state Rep. Katherine Prudhomme-O'Brien, R-Derry, in the Legislature to close a loophole in state law following the 2019 case of Concord High School teacher Primo “Howie” Leung. His case began in the Granite State when students witnessed and reported to school officials seeing Leung allegedly kissing a student of adult age in a car. In 2019, although teachers could easily be fired for engaging in sexual or romantic contact with students no matter their ages, at the time it didn’t violate New Hampshire law. So, Leung wasn’t charged in the Granite State. However, the investigation into his conduct in Concord led to investigations into Leung’s activities in Massachusetts, which resulted in the Bay State bringing multiple felony charges against him for his alleged criminal behavior with students at a camp in Newton, Massachusetts. In Concord, the result of the Leung case were civil suits against the school district and personnel fallout. The New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence supported the bill. Pamela Keilig, the coalition’s policy specialist, said the law sends a “clear message that it is never appropriate for a teacher to engage in sexual contact with a student.” “This legislation was critical in advancing protections for survivors in our state and ensures that all students in a primary or secondary educational setting are protected, even if they have turned 18,” Keilig said. “Youth have the right to learn in a safe environment and should never fear being exploited by adults who are in a position of trust and authority over them.” According to Keilig, sexual relationships between teachers or other school officials of authority and students are “inherently abusive,” because of the power they hold, as a result, students “cannot truly consent to any type of romantic or sexual relationship.” “New Hampshire law now clearly articulates that trusted adults, regardless of their position or employment, will be held accountable when they exploit children in their care,” according to Keilig. Conway agreed, stating, “The new provision in the statute is important because it protects students who are 16 years of age and older from employees, teachers, coaches, etc. at high schools who may use their position of authority/trust to manipulate students into engaging in sexual acts.” The charges against Doucette-Howell allege criminal acts took place in April and May 2021, just a few months after the new provision went into effect in January. Olson said he and his client were aware there was an investigation going on prior to charges being handed down in March 2022. Conway didn’t want to discuss the length of the investigation, but added it’s not unusual for aggravated felonious sexual abuse investigations to take months to complete since a “thorough and detailed investigation” is required to bring appropriate charges and “meet the burden of proof.” ""It is also not unusual to obtain search warrants for electronic devices such as cell phones,” Conway said. “It can take a good amount of time for the investigator to search the devices and go through all of the information on the device that is relevant to the case.” The Rockingham County Sheriff’s Department led the investigation with assistance from the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. According to court documents, Doucette-Howell’s case is scheduled for a dispositional conference in late May.

4/21/2022,"(Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin called off plans for the Russian military to storm the sprawling Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol and said on Thursday he wanted Ukrainian forces there to be hermetically sealed in instead. The full capture of Mariupol, which has been besieged by Russian forces for weeks, is a central part of Moscow's plans to cut Ukraine off from the Sea of Azov and forge a land bridge connecting Russian-annexed Crimea to Russia. Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia's Chechnya region whose forces have been fighting in Mariupol, had suggested that the vast Azovstal facility, which covers more than 11 square kilometres (4.25 square miles), would be stormed after Ukrainian forces holed up inside ignored Russian offers to surrender. But Putin, in a Kremlin meeting with Sergei Shoigu, his defence minister, gave the order to call off the plan to storm it, saying it was better to save the lives of Russian soldiers and officers and to sit back and wait while Ukrainian forces ran out of supplies. ""I consider the proposed storming of the industrial zone unnecessary,"" Putin told Shoigu in a televised meeting at the Kremlin. ""I order you to cancel it. There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities,"" he told Shoigu. ""Block off this industrial area so that a fly cannot not pass through."" Putin called on the remaining Ukrainian fighters in Azovstal to lay down their arms, saying Russia would treat them with respect and provide medical assistance to those injured. Shoigu had earlier told Putin that more than 2,000 Ukrainian fighters were still holed up in the plant and that it might take three or four days to take control of the facility. Shoigu told Putin that Mariupol had symbolic importance for Russia because it was what he called the de facto headquarters of the far-right nationalist Azov battalion which Moscow has promised to destroy. The Azovstal iron and steel works, one of Europe's biggest metallurgical plants, lies in an industrial area that looks out to the Sea of Azov. It houses a multitude of buildings, blast furnaces and rail tracks and has extensive underground facilities too. 'THEY ARE HEROES' Putin congratulated his defence minister for what he called the successful military operation to ""liberate Mariupol"" and asked him to pass on his thanks to Russian troops. ""I want them all to know: in our minds, in the minds of all of Russia, they are heroes,"" Putin said. Russia is due to celebrate its annual victory day holiday on May 9, when it commemorates the World War Two Soviet victory over Nazi Germany and is likely to hold up the full capture of Mariupol when it happens as proof that it is making gains in Ukraine despite heavy losses. Shoigu told Putin that Russia had killed more than 4,000 Ukrainian troops in its campaign to take Mariupol and that 1,478 had given themselves up. He said Russia had evacuated 142,711 civilians from the city too. Putin asked Shoigu for his ministry to come up with new proposals on supporting Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. ""We need to think about additional support measures, and in some cases, about perpetuating the memory of our comrades who showed heroism and sacrificed their lives for the peaceful life of our people in Donbas (eastern Ukraine) and to ensure the peaceful life and existence of Russia itself, the peaceful existence of our country,"" Putin said. Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special military operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

4/21/2022,"The commander of a Navy destroyer who refused the COVID-19 vaccine and sued the service has been removed from command, according to a court filing in his case. ""On Monday, April 11, instead of getting underway with his ship, Navy Commander was 'temporarily reassigned' for 60 days under a new Navy policy that prohibits unvaccinated personnel from going underway on Navy ships,"" a declaration from the officer's lawyer reported to the court. The commander, along with more than 30 unnamed officers and enlisted personnel from all the military branches, sued the military over the vaccine mandate in November 2021 in a federal court in Florida. Since then his case, along with one filed by Navy SEALs in Texas, touched off a legal debate about how much power the military has to enforce the vaccine mandate and the nature of the religious exemption process. Read Next: Land Navigation Is Coming Back to the Army's Basic Leader Course Judge Steve Merryday, who is presiding over the commander's case, ruled in early February that, for the sake of ""preservation of the status quo"" while the suit is being decided, the Navy was barred from reassigning or demoting the commander. A second order, reaffirming and lengthening the term of the injunction, followed Feb. 18. The order set off a series of filings from the service that argued the order forcing it to keep an officer who refused to take the vaccine in a place of command ""indefinitely sidelines a Navy warship."" However, on March 25, the Supreme Court ruled that the Navy is allowed to make its own decisions about whether to deploy sailors who refuse the coronavirus vaccine. On March 30, ""following the Supreme Court's lead,"" the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit stayed Merryday's injunction. Since that time, neither the Navy nor the Justice Department, which has been handling the messaging for the case, would say if the commander had, in fact, been reassigned. Legal filings say the officer, who is not identified in the lawsuit, joined the Navy in 2004 and now has ""nearly 18 years in the service."" Other documents filed by the Navy show that the destroyer he commanded is based in Norfolk, Virginia, and belongs to Destroyer Squadron 26. According to the complaint, the commander filed a religious accommodation request in September 2021 but was denied a month later; he appealed in November. The Navy tried to remove the man from the post but, according to court documents, it wasn't over the accommodation request or his refusal to get the vaccine. The commanding officer's boss -- Capt. Frank Brandon -- told the court that the Navy's objection to keeping the skipper in place was over his disregard for policies designed to protect his own crew. Brandon testified to two incidents that made him lose faith in the commander's ability to lead the destroyer. The first incident happened in early November when, according to Brandon, the commander gave a briefing to ""roughly 50-60 personnel ... in shoulder-to-shoulder proximity,"" despite the fact that ""he could barely speak."" When Brandon questioned the commander in his cabin, the man conceded that he had a sore throat but blamed it on a jog in the cold air. The unvaccinated commander was ordered to get a COVID-19 test, which came back positive. The second incident occurred three months later in early February 2022. According to Brandon, the commander told him he needed to take leave but failed to tell his boss that he was leaving the Norfolk area ""in order to testify in this litigation."" This was not only a breach of Navy travel policy amid the pandemic but a breach of trust as well, he said. ""My loss of confidence in [the ship's commander] is not based on his vaccination status or his denied request for a religious exemption,"" Brandon wrote in the filing. ""It is based on the fact that I cannot trust his judgment, I cannot trust him to look after the welfare of his sailors, and I cannot trust him to be honest with me."" A service policy, published in November 2021, notes that ""Navy service members who are not vaccinated, regardless of exemption status, may be temporarily reassigned with concurrence of the first flag officer in the administrative chain of command based on operational readiness and mission requirements."" -- Konstantin Toropin can be reached at konstantin.toropin@military.com.
