1/21/2022,"The UK data watchdog has intervened in the debate over end-to-end encryption, warning that delaying its introduction puts “everyone at risk” including children. The Information Commissioner’s Office said strongly encrypting communications strengthens online safety for children by reducing their exposure to threats such as blackmail, while also allowing businesses to share information securely.  The watchdog was responding to the launch of a government-backed campaign that said social media platforms would be “willingly blindfolding” themselves to child abuse if they pushed ahead with end-to-end encryption for private messaging. “E2EE [end-to-end encryption] serves an important role both in safeguarding our privacy and online safety,” said Stephen Bonner, the ICO’s executive director for innovation and technology. “It strengthens children’s online safety by not allowing criminals and abusers to send them harmful content or access their pictures or location.” Child safety campaigners have warned that the encryption plans would prevent law enforcement, and tech platforms, from seeing messages by ensuring that only the sender and recipient can view their content – a process known as end-to-end encryption. Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook Messenger and Instagram apps are preparing to introduce end-to-end encryption and their plans were strongly criticised last year by the home secretary, Priti Patel, who described them as “not acceptable”. Bonner said accessing encrypted content was not the only way to catch abusers. Other methods used by law enforcement include infiltrating abuse rings, listening to reports from children targeted by abusers and using evidence from convicted abusers. He added: “Until we look properly at the consequences, it is hard to see any case for reconsidering the use of E2EE – delaying its use leaves everyone at risk, including children.” The ICO, which oversees the protection of people’s data in the UK, believes that end-to-end encryption is one of the most reliable ways of protecting the data of people who use large messaging platforms. Bonner said encryption protects children by preventing criminals and abusers from accessing their pictures – which could expose them to the risk of blackmail – and their location. Meta, the owner of Messenger and Instagram, said in November last year it would delay its end-to-end encryption plans by a year to 2023. Its WhatsApp messaging service already uses end-to-end encryption. Damian Hinds, the home office minister, said the government-backed campaign, called No Place to Hide, was calling for a “more balanced debate” on the issue. Writing in the Times, he added: “There is a risk that end-to-end encryption, without the right safety capabilities, blinds companies and law enforcement, taking us backwards. Neither this government, nor society as a whole could accept that.” Responding to the ICO, the NSPCC said end-to-end encryption offered privacy benefits but put children at risk if it was poorly implemented. “That’s why the NSPCC wants companies to risk assess end-to-end encryption and balance the privacy and safety requirements of all users, including young people, to ensure it is rolled out in the best interests of the child,” said Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the charity.",News/Technology,"End-to-end encryption protects children, says UK information watchdog",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/21/end-to-end-encryption-protects-children-says-uk-information-watchdog
1/21/2022,"The UK government will invest £100m in Britishvolt as the car battery manufacturing startup seeks to build Britain’s first large-scale “gigafactory” in the north-east of England. The government’s Automotive Transformation Fund will invest alongside asset management company Abrdn and its majority-owned property investment arm, Tritax, to fund a sale and leaseback deal for the huge building that will house the electric car battery factory, near Blyth in Northumberland.  Peter Rolton, Britishvolt’s executive chairman, said: “The UK automotive industry needs a local source of batteries. Chinese or other Asian imports are not going to be an option. There will be very, very significant shortfalls of batteries. We are absolutely vital to maintain the UK industry and support those jobs.” Britishvolt is one of two major UK battery manufacturing projects that has secured funding, alongside an expansion of an existing plant at Sunderland owned by China’s Envision that supplies to Nissan. The company is hoping to build the plant rapidly with the aim of supplying a large part of the UK car industry’s needs as it transitions from internal combustion engines to electric cars that produce zero exhaust emissions. It is in talks with several potential clients, and sportscar maker Lotus has signed a memorandum of understanding, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The plant will employ about 3,000 workers when it is at full capacity in around 2028. The first batteries are scheduled to start production in 2024 to take advantage of rising demand ahead of the UK’s 2030 ban on new cars without a battery. The government and Britishvolt declined to detail the size of the government investment, citing commercial confidentiality. However, a source with knowledge of the negotiations said it was worth about £100m. The government-funded Advanced Propulsion Centre calculates that the UK will need to produce batteries with a capacity of 90 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year if it is to retain a car industry of a similar size. Current UK production capacity is less than 2GWh, but Britishvolt hopes to produce 30GWh. Local authorities in the West Midlands and Somerset are trying to attract investors to two more potential battery manufacturing sites. The West Midlands site at Coventry airport last week gained pre-emptive planning permission. Rolton said: “The company was still working on the timing of a planned stock market listing which will raise the money to build the production line. The full project is expected to cost £3.8bn, but the government backing has already helped in conversations with potential investors.” Britishvolt has previously won backing from Glencore, the FTSE 100 miner, and preparatory construction work at the 93-hectare site has begun. Securing investment in UK-based battery manufacturing has been an important goal for the government. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has on several occasions referred to his hopes for the project as part of his plans to “level up” parts of the country that have missed out on investment in recent decades. The plant will be based in the constituency of Wansbeck, narrowly retained by Labour in the 2019 general election. It is next door to Blyth Valley, a seat formerly part of Labour’s “red wall”, which voted in a Conservative MP for the first time in that election. Johnson said the plan “is a strong testament to the skilled workers of the north-east and the UK’s place at the helm of the global green industrial revolution”. He added that the factory will “boost the production of electric vehicles in the UK”. Rolton said Britishvolt had taken part in a jobs fair in the area which prompted “queues round the block”, while some parents even took children out of school to attend. “That’s what it means for the area,” he said.",News/Environment, Britishvolt gets £100m boost to build UK’s first large-scale ‘gigafactory’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/21/britishvolt-electric-car-battery-uk-gigafactory-blyth-jobs
1/21/2022,"Norwich’s hopes of following up on last weekend’s win over Everton by prevailing in Friday’s crucial six-pointer against Watford suffered a blow when it was confirmed Tim Krul would miss the game with a shoulder injury. While one goalkeeper’s misfortune is another’s opportunity, Norwich fans won’t take much confidence from Angus Gunn’s most recent spell deputising for Krul between the sticks, when it could be argued he could have done a lot better for four of the eight goals Norwich conceded in games against Arsenal and Crystal Palace over the festive period. “Gunny was disappointed with the results that we had in the two games that he played in,” said Dean Smith. “He has been working hard to get that opportunity back again and it has presented itself now, so he knows he has got to go and play well.” No pressure, Angus. BG  Watford v Norwich City, Friday 8pm (all times GMT) Ralf Rangnick’s decision to substitute Cristiano Ronaldo in Manchester United’s 3-1 win against Brentford on Thursday dominated the post-match headlines. But this distracted attention from the more concerning issue for the manager: a first half in which Brentford battered United and could have been out of sight. Rangnick was seen trying to placate a visibly angry Ronaldo on the bench in the closing stages – a neat visual metaphor for the club’s seemingly intractable problems. Ronaldo currently wields disproportionate power in relation to his ability, like many other contemporary footballers, and it is debatable whether the United team is better with him in it. Sir Alex Ferguson helped to get Ronaldo’s return from Juventus over the line, and remains an influential presence, but as a manager he would simply not have tolerated such petulance from a player. Rangnick is seen as a footballing progressive but, if he is going to transform Old Trafford, Ronaldo is not the only towering figure from the club’s past whose influence should be reduced. LM Manchester United v West Ham, Saturday 3pm Everton host Aston Villa at Goodison in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off, a game in which Duncan Ferguson and Steven Gerrard renew hostilities for the first time since Liverpool beat Everton 3-1 in a Merseyside derby at Anfield in March 2006. On that occasion both men spent most of the game monitoring proceedings from the touchline – Gerrard was sent off after 18 minutes while “Big Dunc” came on as a second-half substitute. A mere 16 years later, they will again be watching from the sidelines as Everton’s caretaker manager attempts to arrest his team’s alarming slide towards the relegation zone and Aston Villa’s boss tries to end a run of four games without a win. With Gerrard’s managerial credentials already established, Ferguson needs the win more. Famously tight-lipped off the pitch as a player and never one for self-promotion, he will expect Everton’s underperforming players to help him stake a claim for a job many believe him to be to the manner born. BG Everton v Aston Villa, Saturday 12.30pm With Reece James and Ben Chilwell still out, a good way to get at Chelsea is by attacking down their sides. Brighton’s Tariq Lamptey and Marc Cucurella have had great fun at their expense in recent weeks, including in Tuesday’s draw at the Amex. Tottenham? Not so much. Chelsea coasted through both Carabao Cup semi-finals, with Matt Doherty suffering particular torment as Spurs’ left wing-back. But the Irishman showed on Wednesday how effective he can be in his preferred position on the right by contributing mightily to the extraordinary comeback against Leicester. He is at least as good a defender as Emerson Royal and more impactful than the Brazilian going forward – thanks to his aerial threat in particular. Marcos Alonso will not want Doherty to start at right wing-back when Spurs go to Stamford Bridge. PD Chelsea v Tottenham, Sunday 4.30pm Manchester City are locked on course for another league title but Southampton’s season remains one that may go either way. There is an air of optimism since the arrival of the Serbian media magnate Dragan Solak, but the euphoria of a thumping win over Brentford to welcome their new owner was tempered by defeat at Wolves last weekend. Solak has spoken of a long-term investment plan so although discussions are ongoing over signing Armando Broja from Chelsea, a January trolley dash looks highly unlikely. Ralph Hassenhüttl will hope to be backed in the transfer market come the end of the campaign, with the austerity of the Gao Jisheng years left behind, but the more pressing issue is steering his thin, inconsistent squad towards the top half. Considering the kind of fluent form that Pep Guardiola’s team are in, Saturday’s visit of the champions will most likely mean focusing on damage limitation. LM Southampton v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm Mikel Arteta, like most managers, has railed against fixture congestion this season and the demands it places on players. But such complaints do not wash when he then chooses to bring on Thomas Partey a few hours after the player has got off a plane from Cameroon, where he had just contested three high-stakes Africa Cup of Nations matches in draining conditions. For the Ghanaian to be sent off for a couple of late challenges should not necessarily come as a surprise. Now, with Granit Xhaka also suspended, Arsenal again have a problem in central midfield for the visit of Burnley and, using his own logic, it is one partly of Arteta’s creation. Burnley, meanwhile, have certainly been well rested for the game, having played two league matches since 12 December. PD Arsenal v Burnley, Sunday 2pm As mentioned earlier, Brentford’s failure to convert a raft of first-half chances cost them dearly against Manchester United, while for all their good football Wolves were struggling to find the net with any sort of frequency until a recent glut of six goals in two games, against Sheffield United and Southampton. Only Burnley (16) and Norwich (10) have scored fewer than the 17 Premier League goals celebrated by Bruno Lage’s side this season, but with even the profligate – eight goals in 159 top-flight appearances – Adama Traoré getting on the scoresheet against Saints, the floodgates might finally have opened. While they lost against United, Brentford did at least see Ivan Toney end a run of eight games without a goal with his side’s late consolation. Saturday’s crowd at the Brentford Community Stadium could be treated to a glut of goals, even if the very suggestion here means a scoreless draw is probably guaranteed. BG Brentford v Wolves, Saturday 3pm When Crystal Palace lost 3-0 at Anfield in September, the goals were scored by Mohamed Salah, Naby Keïta and Sadio Mané. So the Africa Cup of Nations is well timed for Patrick Vieira, since all three of those players will still be away with their national teams when Liverpool head to Selhurst Park on Sunday. All three goals at Anfield came from set pieces, though, and fragility from those is a problem Vieira has not yet been able to solve fully. There’s also the fact that the most significant African absentee on Sunday could actually be Cheikhou Kouyaté, since Palace’s midfield is much weaker without the Senegal international. PD Crystal Palace v Liverpool, Sunday 2pm One way or another, Leicester’s spectacular stoppage-time collapse against Tottenham is likely to have a lasting impact. The under-strength Foxes were a few seconds from an unlikely victory, handed to them by James Maddison, before Steven Bergwijn’s double denied them even a single point. Will Brendan Rodgers’ side now pull together, collectively resolving not to throw points away in such careless fashion again? Or has their usual springtime slump arrived early this season? Brighton arrive looking buoyant, having got out of jail against Crystal Palace with a late goal in their 1-1 draw last Friday, before holding lavishly-funded Chelsea to a draw on Tuesday night. Following the shocking denouement against Spurs, now would be a good time for Leicester to prove they still belong in the scrap for Europe. LM Leicester v Brighton, Sunday 2pm Eddie Howe needs to tell Newcastle players about the joys of the Championship. He should tell them they will love it, it will be a blast, the atmosphere at St James’ Park will be festive at every home match and, basically, everything’s going to be all right. Maybe then Newcastle’s players will stop fretting about relegation and will be able to play without fear. Too often this season – andregardless of the manager – many Newcastle players have seemed so scared of making a mistake or failing that they have ended up doing just that. The symptoms are particularly noticeable when they take a lead: they often wind up cowering in their own half, neutered by the prospect of giving away their advantage. Last weekend’s draw against Watford was the latest of many examples. They need to learn how to play with abandon and Leeds, who have pulled nine points clear of the drop zone, will show them how. That is something for Newcastle to be enthused about. Or very afraid.

1/21/2022,"An 88-year-old woman has told of her joy at becoming the first patient in the UK to benefit from a groundbreaking bionic eye implant that enabled her to detect signals for the first time since going blind. The woman from Dagenham suffers from geographic atrophy. The condition is the most common form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which affects millions of people worldwide and can cause loss of sight.  The breakthrough, which experts say offers hope of restoration of sight to people suffering vision loss because of dry AMD, involves a revolutionary chip that was implanted behind her blind left eye. Hi-tech camera glasses she was given to wear this week captured the scene in front of her before relaying the data to the implant that sent an electrical signal to her brain – just like natural vision. “Losing the sight in my left eye through dry AMD has stopped me from doing the things I love, like gardening, playing indoor bowls and painting with watercolours,” the unidentified woman said in a statement released by Moorfields eye hospital NHS foundation trust. “I am thrilled to be the first to have this implant, excited at the prospect of enjoying my hobbies again and I truly hope that many others will benefit from this too.” She received the Prima System device – developed by Pixium Vision in France – at Moorfields in London as part of a Europe-wide clinical trial backed by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields and the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology. The implant works by surgically inserting a 2mm-wide microchip under the centre of a patient’s retina. The patient then wears special glasses, containing a video camera that is linked to a small computer attached to their waistband. The chip captures the video provided by the glasses, and in turn transmits this to the computer, which uses artificial intelligence algorithms to process the data and guide the focus of the glasses. The glasses then project this image as an infrared beam back through the eye to the chip, which transforms it into an electrical signal that travels back through the retina cells and into the brain. The brain then interprets this signal as if it were natural vision. Mahi Muqit, consultant vitreoretinal surgeon at Moorfields eye hospital, said: “The success of this operation, and the evidence gathered through this clinical study, will provide the evidence to determine the true potential of this treatment.” Muqit, who is an honorary clinical lecturer at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and a NIHR research investigator, added: “This groundbreaking device offers the hope of restoration of sight to people suffering vision loss due to dry AMD.”",News/Society,Bionic eye implant enables blind UK woman to detect visual signals,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/21/bionic-eye-implant-blind-uk-woman-detect-visual-signals
1/21/2022,"More than 30,000 jobs would be put at risk if the government were to scrap the energy bill levy that pays for home insulation improvements for poor households, the industry has warned. Ministers are mooting an end to the Energy Company Obligation (ECO), a £1bn levy on energy bills that pays for energy efficiency measures for people on low incomes. The energy price cap is expected to rise by about £700 to £2,000 for the average household bill in April, after a surge in gas prices.  The government is reluctant to take major steps such as windfall tax, which the Labour party and others have called for, and the longstanding ECO has been targeted by the Treasury as a way of reducing bills. However, the amounts saved from scrapping it would be small, at about £29 on the average bill. The Insulation Assurance Authority has written to ministers urging them to keep ECO. The body said the levy added less than 52p a week to the average energy bill but had reduced household energy bills by about £300 a year on average for the 3m homes treated so far. Nigel Donohue, chief executive of the industry body, said: “ECO has been the backbone in supporting those hit hardest by fuel poverty. We need a long-term solution to end our dependence upon high cost gas and that means we must ramp up energy efficiency investment. Cutting or just suspending ECO would be utterly self-defeating, lead to mass redundancies in the industry and harm the most vulnerable. ECO must be saved.” He warned that any move to abandon or suspend the measure would be disastrous for jobs. The insulation industry has suffered from government policy reversals over the last decade, when plans for a nationwide “green deal” insulation scheme were first trumpeted from 2010 then abruptly squashed in 2015. That left the ECO as the only remaining insulation programme, until the “green homes grant” was launched in 2020 then scrapped last spring after six months of maladministration. Experts have said this “stop-start” pattern to government intervention in the market has led to a severe lack of investment, training and skills in insulation, which is proving problematic as the UK has the leakiest homes in Europe. Previous moves to slash the ECO in the face of high energy prices led to the number of jobs in insulation falling by about half, the IAA said.",News/Environment,"More than 30,000 jobs at risk if insulation levy cut from fuel bills",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/21/more-than-30000-jobs-at-risk-if-insulation-levy-cut-from-fuel-bills
1/21/2022,"The UK’s state pension payment system is not fit for purpose, resulting in the “shameful shambles” of an underpayment scandal that left tens of thousands of pensioners short-changed, according to a scathing report from a committee of MPs. The public accounts committee (PAC) also lambasted the Department for Work and Pensions for its “complacency”, and accused it of not having been “sufficiently transparent” to parliament about the problems.  In September last year it emerged that the DWP was estimating it had underpaid 134,000 pensioners, mostly women, a total of more than £1bn of state pension cash that they were entitled to. At the time, the National Audit Office said this long-term underpayment of state pensioners – some problems date as far back as 1985 – was the result of repeated errors that were almost inevitable amid complex rules and outdated IT systems. It emerged that those affected that the DWP could trace would be paid an average of £8,900 each. The state pension is paid to around 12.4 million people, and these errors affect pensioners who first claimed it before April 2016 and who do not have a full national insurance record or should have inherited additional entitlement from their deceased partner. Of the 134,000 people hit by these problems, it is thought that 94,000 are alive – about 0.9% of those currently claiming the pre-2016 basic state pension. Where those affected have died, the department owes the pensioners’ estates. The PAC decided to investigate the issue, and said the underpayments uncovered ranged between one pence and £128,000. In February 2021 the Guardian featured the case of Angela Jenner, now 79, who was getting only 86p a week as her state pension but, after making a claim, saw this increased to £80.45 a week, and also learned she was owed £42,700. Dame Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the committee, said that for decades the DWP had relied on a state pension payment system that was “clunky” and required staff to check many databases, “and now some pensioners and the taxpayer are paying in spades”. She added: “This is a shameful shambles. The PAC expects the DWP to set out the step changes it will make to ensure it is among their last.” The report stated that the pension payment system “is not fit for purpose”, and set out a series of recommendations. The committee said the department was now on its ninth go at fixing the mistakes since 2018, and that this “comes at great cost to the taxpayer” – the bill for staff costs alone is expected to top £24m by the end of 2023. The MPs also said the DWP had “left people in the dark over their entitlement”, adding: “The department also admits that many other pensioners are under-claiming their state pension … these pensioners need clearer information to act or risk missing out on significant sums.” Responding to the report, a DWP spokesperson said resolving the historical state pension underpayments that had been made by successive governments was a priority, and it was committed to doing so as quickly as possible.“We have set up a dedicated team and devoted significant resources to processing outstanding cases, and have introduced new quality control processes and improved training to help ensure this does not happen again. Those affected will be contacted by us to ensure they receive all that they are owed.”The spokesperson added that the DWP would respond formally in due course.",News/Society,UK state pension systems not fit for purpose – MPs’ report,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/21/uk-state-pension-systems-not-fit-for-purpose-mps-report
1/21/2022,"To become a “true legend” at Liverpool, Pepijn Lijnders had claimed on the eve of the rearranged Carabao Cup semi-final, “you need to go for the national cups as well.” Jürgen Klopp’s assistant was not downplaying past glories but talking up the future of a Liverpool team that has evolved to the extent he expected it to punish Arsenal even without the cutting edge of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané. Lijnders was talking of Liverpool’s hunger too, and it appeared he had written the script. A 2022 Carabao Cup winner’s medal will not define the Liverpool legacy of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil van Dijk, Jordan Henderson or any other player who ended the club’s 30-year wait for a Premier League title and delivered a sixth European Cup to Anfield. But this Liverpool team should have more honours to its name. Six years without a Wembley appearance is too long for a squad of such talent. The desire to correct both flowed through a commanding victory at the Emirates Stadium where the experience in Klopp’s side toyed and tormented the youth of Arsenal. Their celebrations at Anfield a week ago did indeed prove premature.  This was Diogo Jota’s night, aided and abetted by two more assists from the laser-guided right foot of Alexander-Arnold. The striker has cause to create his own legend. The Portugal international did not taste Premier League or Champions League success with Liverpool – Chelsea at Wembley next month will be his first opportunity to claim silverware with Klopp’s team. Salah and Mané will both have returned from the Africa Cup of Nations by then. His two accomplished goals, plus the penalty that sealed the shoot-out victory over Leicester in the quarter-finals, present a formidable argument for his inclusion among a wealth of world-class options. Jota’s second goal in particular underlined his progress at Anfield. Collecting Alexander-Arnold’s pinpoint delivery on his chest before lobbing the advancing Aaron Ramsdale, it was a finish so good that even VAR could not spoil the moment. Klopp’s full-blooded reaction to the eventual awarding of the goal confirmed how much a place at Wembley meant. Klopp’s team selections, and insistence on playing the kids in an FA Cup replay against Shrewsbury in 2020 while he preserved the first team’s winter break, have forged the impression of a manager with little regard for domestic cup competitions. At times, his protestations to the contrary have sounded hollow but closer inspection of his record in the League Cup does offer mitigation. Having reached the final in his debut season as Liverpool manager, where defeat came in a penalty shoot-out against Manchester City, Klopp reached the semi-finals in his first full season in charge. Southampton’s victory over two legs remains his only semi-final loss in 11 attempts. So not a shabby start. Subsequent early exits arrived away at Leicester, at home to an Eden Hazard-inspired Chelsea, against Aston Villa with an academy side while everyone else was in Qatar for the Club World Cup, and to Arsenal in a penalty shoot-out. The calibre of opposition and demands upon a Champions League-winner should also be taken into account when assessing Klopp’s approach to the League Cup. His determination to reach Wembley on 27 February was again evident from the lineup against Arsenal, his satisfaction clear in his post-match jubilation. With the exception of Caoimhin Kelleher for Alisson and arguably Kaide Gordon for Takumi Minamino, Liverpool fielded their strongest available side, and there were sound reasons for the inclusion of the Republic of Ireland international and the gifted 17-year-old forward. Kelleher is Liverpool’s Carabao Cup keeper – he missed the first leg only because Alisson was in need of games after a spell out with Covid – and he produced another performance that vindicated Klopp’s growing faith in the Brazilian’s backup. There was a fine fingertip save to turn Alexandre Lacazette’s early free-kick onto the bar, a near-post block from Gabriel Martinelli, accurate distribution and sharp judgement to cover behind the Liverpool defence. Despite its uncertain start, with Martinelli troubling Alexander-Arnold, Joël Matip’s distribution awry and Van Dijk also caught out, Liverpool’s rearguard would offer up few opportunities to Mikel Arteta’s forwards from open play. Gordon was in on merit, his manager explained, having impressed in training and during a late cameo against Brentford on Sunday. His selection was another fillip for his fellow teenagers in the academy. The winger, signed from the ongoing turmoil that is Derby County 11 months ago, has already etched his name into the Liverpool record books as their youngest goalscorer in the FA Cup. Gordon almost became their youngest goalscorer in league history on Sunday and, though he blazed a gilt-edged chance over at the Emirates and rarely escaped the attentions of Kieran Tierney during his 63 minutes on the pitch, he will only benefit from the experience. Gordon’s chance was presented on a plate by Jota, who left Ben White flailing down the left before finding the teenager with an intelligent pass from the byline. Creative and clinical, Jota embodied the crucial difference between the semi-finalists.",Sport/Football,Up for the cups: Jürgen Klopp ends Liverpool’s wait for Wembley final | Andy Hunter,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/20/klopp-shows-regard-for-carabao-cup-with-strong-side-and-wild-celebrations
1/21/2022,"Jürgen Klopp paid tribute to his “world-class” match-winner Diogo Jota after Liverpool swept aside Arsenal and made history by reaching their 13th League Cup final. Klopp will lead his team out against Chelsea at Wembley on 27 February with Liverpool aiming to win the trophy for a record ninth time after Jota’s two goals saw off Mikel Arteta’s side, who once again finished the game with 10 men. Thomas Partey was dismissed late in the game for a high tackle on Fabinho and though the game was already lost by that point, it was Arsenal’s sixth red card of the season and their third already in 2022.  Ultimately, it was a footnote in the story as Jota wrote the headlines to Klopp’s delight. “The mood in the dressing room is over the moon. Difficult game, difficult time but the boys were exceptional,” said the manager, with the club having made competition history by clinching final No 13. “First half, Arsenal started lively, then we calmed it down, played good football and created plenty. Second half similar. We scored two wonderful goals, Diogo Jota on fire. We were completely convinced when he arrived at the club he would help us massively. Since he is here he has made another step, he has turned into a really world-class striker. “Mentality mixed with quality is the reason we signed him. Of course he scored two goals, he is incredibly important to us, so it is that mix of his skills that is really exciting. He is in good shape as well and long may it continue.” For Arsenal, it was a story of what might have been having ground out a 0-0 draw in the first leg at Anfield. Partey’s suspension – earned just hours after returning to London from Africa Cup of Nations duty with Ghana – further depletes Arsenal’s threadbare squad before the visit of Burnley on Sunday. And coming after similar sanctions for Granit Xhaka and Gabriel in recent weeks, Arteta had clearly decided enough is enough. “It’s a big loss,” he said of Partey’s red card. “We have to learn from that. We’ve played the last three games [actually three of the last four] with 10 men, and against the top sides you can’t do that. It’s difficult enough to beat them, but with 10 men it becomes a real challenge with the men we have out. “It has happened for different reasons, now we have to eradicate it completely. If we want to win games we have to stay playing with 11 players.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp hails ‘world class’ Diogo Jota after double cuts down Arsenal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/20/jurgen-klopp-hails-world-class-diogo-jota-after-double-cuts-down-arsenal
1/21/2022,"The federal government has accused rapid antigen test suppliers of misleading customers about how many RATs they can deliver and then attempting to blame the commonwealth when they can’t deliver the “missing” tests. The Coalition has promised millions of tests are on the way but they are still in short supply on retail shelves. A program to give free tests to concession card holders begins on Monday while the shortages persist.  Pharmacists around the country have been told their orders will not be filled because the commonwealth has requisitioned them. However, the federal and state governments have denied this is the case and accused suppliers of lying. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said the claims were “false, misleading and untrue” and made by companies that had “overcommitted and not been able to deliver”. The Therapeutic Goods Administration boss, Prof John Skerritt, said some companies wanted to “make a lot of money where they can”. “We have had a lot of trouble with companies making false claims,” he said. In South Australia, orders for 200,000 tests have not been filled and the suppliers reportedly blamed government for taking them. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will investigate after the SA premier, Steven Marshall, wrote to the commissioner, Rod Sims, asking him to investigate “as a matter of urgency”. “I have been concerned to be advised of allegations that supply of rapid antigen tests that was supposed to be reaching retailers in SA has been diverted to other jurisdictions,” the premier wrote. “I am deeply concerned by suggestions there has been interference in the commercial market which has resulted in suppliers reneging on contracts and preventing supply reaching SA customers.” An ACCC spokesperson confirmed they would look into the issue. “The ACCC is aware of a number of reports that business customers are being given various explanations by their suppliers about why orders for rapid antigen tests cannot be delivered as promised. The ACCC is investigating some of these claims,” the spokesperson said. Several suppliers have told their customers they cannot provide the ordered tests because the government requisitioned them. But the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Thursday that suppliers were telling “falsehoods”. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia said this week that while governments weren’t requisitioning tests under their emergency powers, suppliers often preferred to deal with big buyers including governments and large corporations. On Thursday, Hunt said his department would report companies making false claims to the ACCC. “There are different reasons and excuses put out [and] there is a global spike in demand. As a consequence of these false claims, I have asked my department to report where we are aware of them,” the health minister said. Skerritt said as well as the false claims there are also forged letters of TGA approval being used, which he has reported to the police. “Unfortunately, while we have a lot of companies doing some really good work, getting product out there in the supply chains, there are some who clearly are doing the wrong thing,” he said. Multiple companies have recently registered with the TGA to provide tests. Dean Whiting, the chief executive of Pathology Technology Australia, said his members had assured him there was no attempt by any government agencies to acquire their tests. “Tests are being supplied in Australia by companies that have a strong track record in diagnostic products globally – but there are also a significant number of new entrants supplying rapid antigen tests who have not had experience in this part of the industry in the past.”",News/Australia news,Coalition accuses suppliers of misleading customers over ‘missing’ rapid antigen tests,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/21/coalition-accuses-suppliers-of-misleading-customers-over-missing-rapid-antigen-tests

Tongan man Lisala Folau, a retired carpenter, was knocked off the tree he had climbed to escape an onrushing tsunami. He was swept out to sea and drifted and swam for more than 24 hours but survived, floating 13km to arrive at Tonga’s capital. Notable quote: “Bear in mind that I am disabled. I can’t walk properly,” Folau told Tongan radio station Broadcast FM. “And when I can, I believe a baby can walk faster than I.” Incredible parenting: As Folau floated further out to sea, he could hear his son calling to him. “I kept my silence,” he said. “For if I answered him he would jump in and try to rescue me.” How long will it take me to read? Three minutes. Nursultan Nazarbayev spent 30 years as the president of Kazakhstan. Now, in the wake of deadly protests, the new regime is trying to distance themselves from his crumbling cult of personality. Background context: “The average monthly salary in Kazakhstan is less than £450,” Pjotr Sauer writes. “While according to a 2019 report by KPMG, 162 people in the country own more than 50% of its wealth. Much of the elite property is in the hands of Nazarbayev’s extended family.” How long will it take me to read? Three minutes What can one learn from climbing the entire mountain of Marvel content? For starters, Douglas Walk says, that “not even the people telling the story have read the whole thing”. And “that’s not how it was meant to be experienced”. Most intriguing hero: The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, who has the “proportional speed and strength of a squirrel”. “But her real power,” Wolk writes, “is a knack for creative nonviolent conflict resolution, a rare quality in a superhero.” Least intriguing hero: The Punisher, “who has so far slaughtered upwards of 1,000 drug dealers, security guards and the like. (I counted.)” After a long and successful career as a professionally rugby player, Joe van Niekerk dropped off the grid, immersed himself in study and travel. Now he spends his days working as an organic farmer in Costa Rica. Notable quote: “I needed to cleanse my body from the absolute carnage of 15 years of professional rugby,” van Niekerk tells Jonathan Drennan. “I needed to look within myself. There was a feeling of loss there, who the hell am I? You’ve been told you’re this and that. You’re Joe the rugby player. Then that’s gone and, in spite of that initial feeling of loss, eventually, I found such joy and peace.” I don’t care about rugby. Same. This is still a great interview. In the ABC’s new mini-series Muster Dogs, a litter of kelpies are placed with farmers and put through their paces. The aim? To go from puppies to full-blown working dogs in just 12 months (it usually takes three years). Notable quote: “It’s all about bonding and giving them a pat so they learn what to do and what not to do,” Queensland farmer Frank Finger tells Alex McKinnon. “It’s very much the same as raising a family.” When can I watch this? 7.40pm on Sunday 23 January on ABC TV. I need more dog content now.
