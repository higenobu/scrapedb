4/21/2022,"Back in late January, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman saw Netflix’s stock price plunge as a $1.1 billion buying opportunity. So Wednesday’s nosedive, with the stock falling 38% in early hours, raises the question: Is he hunkering down or doubling down? Whatever Ackman’s doing, he certainly took a substantial hit following the company’s first-quarter earnings report, when Netflix revealed it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the first three months of the year and expects to lose 2 million more this quarter. Exactly how big a hit he took is a nebulous number. When Ackman revealed the purchase, he didn’t say what he paid. But he did note that he’d bought more than 3.1 million shares between Jan. 21 and Jan. 26, when the stock was in the $351.46 to $409.14 range. Assuming the best-case scenario for his purchase, buying all of those shares at the low end of the range would still represent a loss for Ackman of nearly $415 million in less than 24 hours. Ackman is no stranger to volatility. In 2017, his investment in Chipotle bombed, only to rebound, then triple in price. And through his hedge bets at the start of the pandemic, he turned $27 million into $2.6 billion. The founder and CEO of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management made his reputation as an activist investor. He’s often publicly courted his investments (which isn't always welcome), and his New York–based firm is known for taking stakes in companies and pressuring their leaders to make changes or face proxy fights. In early 2015, he made an ill-fated bet on Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, which resulted in two years of double-digit portfolio losses for his hedge fund firm. Investors then began pulling out of Pershing Square. He has also courted controversy outside of the business world, tweeting in 2021 that he believed Kyle Rittenhouse to be a “civic-minded patriot” and that the 18-year-old had acted in self-defense when he killed two unarmed protesters and wounded a third. Ackman bought Netflix on a dip once and could see this as an opportunity to expand his stake in the company. In announcing the initial purchase, he told investors in Pershing Square, “The opportunity to acquire Netflix at an attractive valuation emerged when investors reacted negatively to the recent quarter’s subscriber growth and management’s short-term guidance.” And in a tweet at the time, he added, “I have long admired Reed Hastings and the remarkable company he and his team have built. We are delighted that the market has presented us with this opportunity.” Correction: An earlier version of this story said that Ackman made the Netflix purchase a month ago. It has been changed.

4/21/2022,"Tesla (TSLA) reported its Q1 earnings after the bell Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom line and recording a record quarter with revenue up 81% year-over-year. Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what analysts were expecting. Revenue: $18.8 billion versus $17.9 billion expected Adjusted earnings per share: $3.22 versus $2.27 expected The company's stock was up more than 4% following the announcement. Tesla, like many of the world’s automakers, continues to grapple with pandemic-induced supply chain problems and a global chip shortage. Tesla was forced to shutter its Shanghai plant for three weeks amid a city-wide lockdown geared toward stopping COVID infections. ""Challenges around supply chain have remained persistent, and our team has been navigating through them for over a year. In addition to chip shortages, recent COVID-19 outbreaks have been weighing on our supply chain and factory operations,"" the company said in a statement. That, coupled with an increase in raw material prices, has pushed Tesla to increase product prices. The company has since reopened its factory as a closed-loop system, meaning employees are sleeping on mattresses on the building’s floor. The automaker, however, also opened two new plants in the quarter, one in Berlin, which will supply Europe with new vehicles, and one in Texas, which is already pumping out EVs. All of this comes amid the backdrop of Musk’s attempted hostile takeover of Twitter (TWTR). He’s expected to make a tender offer to the social network’s shareholders as part of a potential hostile takeover of the social network in the coming days. That could prove to be a distraction for the CEO, who also heads up SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink. Musk is expected to join the company's earnings call, which could help clarify the situation.

4/21/2022,"Shares of Netflix nosedived more than 25% on Tuesday after the streaming giant revealed it lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter alone. The numbers were dismal, to say the least, considering the company had told investors to expect 2.5 million new subscribers in the quarter, and analysts were expecting more than 2.7 million. Even worse, Netflix is now projecting it will lose an additional 2 million subscribers by next quarter. In a lengthy letter to shareholders, the company said its boom during COVID-19 had “obscured the picture recently” and that four key factors—increasing competition, slowing smart TV adoption, password sharing, and macroeconomic developments—have made it “harder to grow membership in many markets.” Management estimates that over 100 million households are using its services without paying due to the sharing of passwords, and said it plans to build a password-sharing subscription model to properly monetize these users. The streaming giant also warned that revenue growth has “slowed considerably” as some pressing growth issues have emerged. In a full-page discussion of its subscriber retention issues, Netflix addressed the various reasons it should continue to bleed subscribers and said, “Our plan is to reaccelerate our viewing and revenue growth by continuing to improve all aspects of Netflix—in particular, the quality of our programming and recommendations, which is what our members value most.” The company added that it lost around 700,000 subscribers as a result of its exit from Russia, but even excluding those losses, it would have managed to add just 500,000 subscribers in the first quarter. ""Sluggish economic growth, increasing inflation, geopolitical events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and some continued disruption from COVID"" were the macro factors Netflix flagged as things simply out of its control. Despite the unsettling figures, Netflix still boasts a paid global subscriber base of 221.6 million, and revenue rose roughly 10% to $7.87 billion in the first quarter. However, the company managed a quarterly profit of only $1.6 billion, down from $1.71 billion in the same period a year ago. The news from Netflix doesn’t exactly have shareholders celebrating. And a few top hedge fund managers are also undoubtedly unpleased. Bill Ackman bought 3.1 million shares of Netflix in January, arguing that the company was undervalued based on a long-term outlook. His holdings were once worth over $1.1 billion, but with shares trading around $260 after today’s drop, his stake is now valued at roughly $800 million. Netflix isn’t the only streaming service facing growth issues, either. Disney is adding a lower-priced version of its streaming platform that will be supported by advertising later this year in an attempt to boost subscriber growth. And after Tuesday’s report, Netflix may be forced to go down the same path. The company is facing growing pressure to add an advertising-based version of its content from investors.

4/21/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s state oil producing giant Rosneft PJSC surprised traders in Europe and Asia with offers to sell large amounts of crude at speed, as well as setting out significant changes to the payment process for at least some of the cargoes. Most Read from Bloomberg Kremlin Insiders Alarmed Over Growing Toll of Putin’s War in Ukraine Netflix Craters After Shock Subscriber Drop, ‘About-Face’ on Ads Ukrainian Troops Risk Being Encircled in New Russian Offensive In Defense of Elon Musk's Managerial Excellence Ukraine Update: Mariupol on Brink; China Stands With Moscow The move is another sign of disruption to some of the firm’s operations following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. There has been a growing pressure in Europe to place an embargo on Russian oil, creating a potential impetus to get purchases finalized before any such step is taken. The firm offered as much as 37.4 million barrels of the nation’s flagship Urals oil for sale from Russia’s western ports for loading in May and June, a tender document seen by Bloomberg shows. That works out at about 40% of its daily seaborne exports of the crude last year. It separately offered 11 prompt cargoes of other grades for loading from the east of the country, according to traders. Both east and west sales are relatively immediate by the standards of the oil market, and traders in both regions said such large and short-term offers were an unusual departure for Rosneft from its usual way of doing business. The terms of the sale of Urals, the nation’s top export grade, stipulate that buyers could in theory pay in dollars, euros, Chinese yuan, Turkish Lira or the UAE’s dirham, although Rosneft’s preference is rubles. That suggests one of the concerns roiling the gas market -- Moscow’s insistence on payment in its domestic currency -- may not afflict oil just yet. Rosneft is seeking 100% pre-payment on the provisional value of any Urals cargoes, something that may be complicated by the fact that the invoice amount will have to be converted from dollars to rubles but other currencies will then be acceptable if necessary. It is also offering as much as 320,000 tons of Siberian Light, another grade that gets shipped from western ports. The European Commission is working on a sixth sanctions package that could include restrictions on some oil imports and goods, a person familiar with the work said last week, but member states including Germany, Austria and Hungary have expressed reservations on a full embargo. Even then, it’s unlikely the commission will present anything concrete until after the second round of the French election on April 24, two separate officials said. In Asia, Rosneft offered eight shipments of ESPO crude for loading in May to a small group of potential buyers via a tender, according to traders who asked not to be identified. It also offered three shipments of Sokol. Rosneft typically supplies its Asian crude to international traders, which then sell that oil to buyers across Northeast Asia, but the war in Ukraine has prompted many companies to rethink their dealings with Russia. Vitol Group -- the world’s top independent oil trader -- said recently that it intends to stop trading Russian-origin crude and oil products by the end of this year. ESPO is loaded at Russia’s eastern port of Kozmino and is a favored grade of Chinese refiners, while Sokol is loaded from the De-Kastri terminal in the Russian Far East. India and China have been willing buyers of Russian crude, while some other countries and companies have stepped back. All the tenders close on Thursday.

4/21/2022,"The Biden administration continued its student loan cancellation effort on Tuesday by announcing that 40,000 borrowers would see their student loans become eligible for discharge under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and 3.6 million more will move closer towards forgiveness. The Education Department will give borrowers retroactive credit for ""forbearance steering,"" where student loan servicers have pushed borrowers into unnecessary interest-accruing forbearance. In another move that could help many other borrowers, the department will also take greater care to accurately track monthly payments for borrowers on income-driven repayment — which allows people who make less money to make smaller payments. The two moves bring millions of borrowers closer to forgiveness on government repayment programs. “Student loans were never meant to be a life sentence, but it’s certainly felt that way for borrowers locked out of debt relief they’re eligible for,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a press release. ""We wanted to act as quickly as possible to address these problems, but we expect these figures to only grow as we continue to analyze and implement these solutions,"" Education Undersecretary James Kvaal said on a call with reporters. A former Obama-era Education Department official last week highlighted the problematic income-driven repayment program as one reason for broad-based student debt forgiveness. ""We ... were very focused on trying to improve income-driven repayment plans and our hope was in the Obama administration that income-driven repayment would help address the student debt crisis,"" former Education Secretary John King, who is running for governor in Maryland, said. ""But the reality is, it hasn't."" A recent investigation by NPR revealed how over the years, loan servicers struggled to implement income-driven repayment, and ended up systematically mismanaging the portfolio. Some providers were not clearly tracking payments and did not know when borrowers qualified for forgiveness. The mismanagement caused many to miss out on debt relief. According to past research from the National Consumer Law Center, despite millions of student debtors qualifying for forgiveness under income-driven repayment terms stipulating that borrowers who pay for 20-25 years can their debt forgiven, only 32 borrowers have actually had their debt cancelled. The government's efforts to reform the system piece by piece instead of broad-based forgiveness has chipped away at the $1.7 trillion in outstanding student loan debt held by 41 million Americans. Overall, the Biden administration has cancelled more than $17 billion in debt for 725,000 borrowers, from fixing Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program to addressing the borrower defense backlog. According to the announcement on Tuesday, the Education Department is addressing two major problems. It's acknowledging people who have loans in forbearance and accrued huge levels of interest payments, and it's also helping borrowers who have had their income-driven payments miscounted. On forbearance, the department noted that loan servicers have in the past placed borrowers into forbearance even when debtors could have qualified for an income-driven repayment plan that would have allowed them to make $0 payments. Forbearance causes borrowers' interest to capitalize and their debt to grow substantially. The department will address this by conducting a one-time adjustment where it will count forbearance of more than 12 consecutive months and more than 36 months cumulative towards forgiveness under income-driven repayment or Public Student Loan Forgiveness. It will also increase oversight of servicers' usage of forbearance. The Education Department will also conduct a one-time revision of income-riven payment counts for all Direct Loans and federally managed Federal Family Education Loan Program loans. Any months where debtors have made payments will count towards income-driven repayment, regardless of payment plan, and consolidation status. And importantly, any borrower who hits the 20- or 25-year mark for monthly payments after this revision will have their loans canceled automatically, the department stated. — Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

4/21/2022,"(Reuters) - The average interest rate on the most popular U.S. home loan climbed to a 12 year high last week and fewer homebuyers sought properties in a sign that the Federal Reserve's aim of cooling the housing market may be beginning to have an impact, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) showed on Wednesday. The average contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 5.20% in the week ended April 15 from 5.13% a week earlier, the MBA survey showed. It has risen 2 percentage points from one year ago. The bulk of the run up, however, has occurred since the start of the year, causing the fastest climb in home-financing costs in decades as the Fed abandoned a cautious approach to raising its benchmark overnight lending rate in favor of swifter and more decisive action to bring down persistently high inflation. The central bank is also set to decide at its next meeting on May 3-4 to begin reducing its portfolio of $8.5 trillion of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, a stash of assets that had helped keep consumer borrowing costs - for mortgages in particular - low throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Those expectations for Fed tightening actions have led to a surge in Treasury yields as financial markets reacted. The yield on the 10-year note US10YT=RR, which acts as a benchmark for mortgage rates, is at its highest level since 2018. The latest increase in home-financing costs also led to fewer mortgage applications last week following a small bump in demand the prior week as buyers rushed to lock in rates before they moved higher. The MBA said its Purchase Composite Index, a measure of all mortgage loan applications for purchase of a single family home, fell 3.0% on a seasonally adjusted basis to 254.0, while the refinance index fell 8%.
