2/28/2022,"Successive generations have experienced what it is like to feel the shadow of nuclear annihilation loom over their daily lives, from the Cuban crisis of 1962, to the missile standoff in Europe in the 1980s. This is shaping up to be our turn. “I’ll be honest – I’m nervous,” Pavel Podvig, one of the world’s leading experts on Russian nuclear forces, said after Vladimir Putin declared a “special mode of combat duty of the deterrence forces”. It is first time it has been done at least since the end of the cold war, and probably longer, according to Podvig, an analyst based in Geneva, where he runs a research project on Russian nuclear forces. “Things have not been rational in the Kremlin recently, and so it’s not a good sign,” he said. Among Russia-watchers and nuclear weapons experts there is no dispute that Putin’s penchant for brandishing Russia’s arsenal reflects weakness and insecurity. And that is not a good trait in the leader of a nuclear superpower. The country’s economy is hollowed out, smaller in dollar terms than South Korea’s and dependent on the vagaries of the oil and gas market. His regime relies increasingly on repression, and its armed forces are proving far from invincible in Ukraine. Russia’s 6,000-warhead arsenal is the only thing that makes it a superpower. Putin’s nuclear signalling is designed to deter the US and its allies from further intervention in Ukraine and economic measures that he may see as an existential threat. But escalation can also take on a momentum of its own and because the margins are so thin – leaders have only a few minutes to make decisions if they believe their countries are under attack – so the US and its allies will have to tread extremely carefully in their response. It is not immediately clear what the practical implications of Putin’s announcement will be. It could mean that bombs are loaded on to bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles on mobile launchers are dispersed, or more nuclear-armed submarines put out to sea. Or it could be more of an administrative process. “As I understand the way the system works, in peacetime it cannot physically transmit a launch order, as if the circuits were “disconnected”, Podvig said. Putin’s order could involve “connecting the wires, so a launch order can go through if issued”. The challenge for the Nato allies now is maintaining the support Ukraine needs for its survival while making clear Putin has a way out of the crisis, rather than climbing up the escalation ladder to the point where it takes on a logic of its own. The threat of a no-fly zone over parts of Ukraine implies Nato is willing to shoot down Russian planes, and would represent a dramatic escalation, while hints at regime change in Moscow are likely to deepen Putin’s paranoia. Laura Kennedy, an expert on disarmament and a former US deputy assistant secretary of state, said there was “no need or sense in mirroring Putin’s reckless nuclear threats, which should be universally condemned”. “I think it’s in everyone’s interests for the west to spell out that the most punishing sanctions … will be lifted when the status quo ante is restored,” said James Acton, the co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But he added that off-ramps only work as long as Putin can see them, and wants to take them. That is in question if the Russian leader has come to see the subjugation of Ukraine as essential to his political survival at home. “It’s difficult for the Wwest to create an de-escalation pathway,” Acton said. “Much presumably depends on how Putin views the domestic consequences of his backing down – something over which the west has no control.”",News/World news,Putin’s nuclear posturing requires west to tread extremely carefully,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/putin-nuclear-warning-requires-west-to-tread-extremely-carefully
2/28/2022,"Moscow is bracing for economic panic as markets open on Monday morning, with the value of the rouble expected to plummet after the US and European Union announced unprecedented sanctions over the weekend. Those measures targeted the Russian central bank, which has intervened to prop up the value of the rouble following Vladimir Putin’s order to invade Ukraine. They also marked the first time Russian banks have been excluded from the Swift international payments system. Top Russian banks such as Sberbank and VTB Bank have assured their customers that they’ll be able to access their rouble deposits and make exchanges into foreign currencies like dollars and euros. But the economic turbulence will mark a key moment when the gravity of the crisis in Ukraine hits home for many ordinary Russians. “It will be something we have not seen before,” said Sergei Guriev, economics professor at France’s Sciences Po and former European Bank for Reconstruction and Development chief economist. Videos circulated on social media of long lines at some Russian ATMs on Sunday morning, although the rush for currency is expected to begin in earnest on Monday as markets open. There are already signs that the value of the rouble has tumbled. By Sunday evening, Russia’s Tinkoff Bank was buying dollars for 89 rubles and selling them for 154 roubles, nearly double the price just three weeks ago. The sanctioning of Russia’s central bank, which experts called “unprecedented”, could halt or limit interventions to prop up the value of the currency, making it harder to insulate Russians from the economic backlash of the invasion. “Sanctioning the central bank is unprecedented,” said Maria Shagina of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs and the Geneva International Sanctions Network. “I think for one of the largest economies in the world – the size matters here. Previously it was only Iran, Venezuela, Syria that were under a maximum pressure campaign.” Some details of the sanctions remain unclear, and it is possible that western governments will make exceptions for oil and gas payments. But the sanctions on the Russian central bank, which could see a significant portion of its $630bn (£470bn) in reserves frozen in G7 countries, mark a quantum leap in the west’s sanctions campaign over the Russian invasion into Ukraine. “There’s a psychological and reputational effect because now everyone just doesn’t want to deal with Russia in general,” said Shagina. Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist of the Institute of International Finance, predicted earlier this week that sanctions on the central bank would have drastic consequences for Russia. “Apart from creating a domestic financial and economic crisis in Russia (massive dollarisation and destruction of the domestic financial sector), it will also make trade with Russia so difficult that it will be nearly impossible for some,” she wrote. “Energy and oil prices massively impacted.” International financial institutions and other organisations have also started to reduce offices or cut ties with Russia due to the sanctions and reputational risk. That has impacted industries far from the banking sector. An events planner for a Moscow entertainment firm said simply: “It’s dead.” “Everything is being cancelled,” the person said, asking not to be named because their firm organised government events. “I’ve basically written off all of my events ordered by international clients. Those that haven’t been cancelled yet will be soon. All I can count on are government contracts.” Companies that sell popular goods also appear to be limiting their exposure to the Russian market. Automakers including Mercedes Benz, Audi, General Motors and Jaguar Land Rover have reportedly halted shipments of goods to Russia. Shops selling iPhones and other products have told Russian reporters they were not receiving further shipments, although the reason was not immediately clear. On Sunday morning, things still appeared calm in Moscow. Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, had taken the unusual step of keeping its branches open over the weekend. But several had no queues, with cashpoints stocked with roubles and ample supplies of dollars for sale for around 100 roubles. By Sunday evening, Russian state TV hosts were exhorting their listeners to hold the line despite the tough economic times ahead, describing a period of economic isolation and autarky that recalls some of the world’s most trouble pariah states. “I know some of you are finding this tough,” said Vladimir Solovyov, a Russian TV host who was sanctioned last week. “We’ll overcome it all, we’ll endure it all. We’ll rebuild our own economy from scratch, an independent banking system, manufacturing and industry. We’ll rely on ourselves.”",News/Business,Moscow braces for market meltdown Monday as new sanctions hit,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/27/ukraine-moscow-braces-for-market-meltdown-monday-as-new-sanctions-hit
2/28/2022,"Cyber conflicts are fought in the shadows but in the case of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it is a group that calls itself Anonymous that has made the most public declaration of war. Late on Thursday the hacker collective tweeted from an account linked to Anonymous, @YourAnonOne, that it had Vladimir Putin’s regime in its sights. The Anonymous collective is officially in cyber war against the Russian government. #Anonymous #Ukraine In the days since the group has claimed credit for several cyber incidents including distributed denial of service attacks – where a site is rendered unreachable by being bombarded with traffic – that have brought down government websites and that of Russia Today, the state-backed news service. The DDoS attacks still appeared to be working on Sunday afternoon, with the official sites for the Kremlin and Ministry of Defence still inaccessible. Anonymous also said it had hacked the Ministry of Defence database, while on Sunday it was claimed the group had hacked Russian state TV channels with pro-Ukraine content including patriotic songs and images from the invasion. JUST IN: #Russian state TV channels have been hacked by #Anonymous to broadcast the truth about what happens in #Ukraine. #OpRussia #OpKremlin #FckPutin #StandWithUkriane pic.twitter.com/vBq8pQnjPc Someone hacked into Russian state TV channels. They feature Ukrainian music and national symbols. 🇺🇦Internet users suspect that this may be another action by the hacker group #Anonymous, which declared a cyber war to Russia in connection with the attack on #Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/XaoclymVTs The group’s nature as an informal collective makes it difficult to attribute these attacks to Anonymous definitively. Jamie Collier, a consultant at US cybersecurity firm Mandiant, said: “It can be difficult to directly tie this activity to Anonymous as targeted entities will likely be reluctant to publish related technical data. However, the Anonymous collective has a track record of conducting this sort of activity and it is very much in line with their capabilities.” Targets in the past have included the CIA, the Church of Scientology and Islamic State, and although the collective was left reeling by a number of arrests in the US in the early 2010s it has revived activity after the murder of George Floyd. One former Anonymous member has described its guiding principle as “anti-oppression”. Russia Today openly attributed the problems with its website to Anonymous, and claimed the attacks came from the US after the group had published its “declaration of war”. A spokesperson for the channel said: “After the statement by Anonymous, RT’s websites became the subject of massive DDoS attacks from some 100 million devices, mostly based in the US.” By contrast cyber activity against Ukraine has been more muted so far, despite widespread predictions that a Russian military assault on the country would be combined with digital shock and awe. Ukrainian websites were hit with DDoS attacks ahead of the offensive, including the Ukrainian defence ministry and PrivatBank, Ukraine’s largest commercial bank, but there has been nothing on the scale of the NotPetya assault in 2017 – when a devastating malware attack attributed to Russia destroyed computers in Ukraine and around the world. Cloudflare, a US tech firm that protects companies against DDoS attacks, described the initial denial of service sorties last week as “relatively modest”. The UK and US governments have already blamed an earlier set of DDoS attacks against Ukrainian websites, on 15 and 16 February, on Moscow. As with the attacks claimed by Anonymous, DDoS salvos are designed to sow confusion and damage morale, whereas malware can cause serious and irreparable damage. NotPetya, a so-called wiper virus that was inserted into tax accounting software used by Ukrainian firms but spilled into other countries, caused $10bn (£7.5bn) of damage worldwide by encrypting computers permanently. Last week Ukraine was hit by an attempted wiper attack, via a new strain of malware dubbed HermeticWiper that prevented computers from rebooting. However, the scale of the attack left only several hundred machines affected and its geographic reach beyond Ukraine has been limited to Latvia and Lithuania. There have been cyber skirmishes elsewhere in the conflict. Partial restrictions have been imposed on Facebook by the Russian government after officials accused the social network of censoring state-backed media on the platform, prompting Facebook to ban ads from Russian state media. Google’s YouTube platform has also banned state media adverts. Another US tech titan, Elon Musk, is providing satellite internet access to Ukraine via his Starlink satellites, while the Ukrainian government is openly seeking international donations in cryptocurrency and has reportedly received millions of dollars in response.

Ciaran Martin, professor of practice at the Blavatnik School of Government, Oxford University, and former head of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, says cyber has played “remarkably little part” in the conflict, at least so far. “The cyber activity from Russia against Ukraine has been there but is consistent with Russia’s cyber harassment of the country going back years. Similarly, from what we can see, the response against Russia from the West has not had a strong cyber component so far – it has been about stringent sanctions. All of this might change, and the West is right to remain on high alert for increased cyber activity.”",News/World news,Anonymous: the hacker collective that has declared cyberwar on Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/anonymous-the-hacker-collective-that-has-declared-cyberwar-on-russia
2/28/2022,"The Biden administration on Sunday condemned Vladimir Putin’s decision to place Russia’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert. The White House also faced growing calls from senior Republicans to target Russia’s energy sector with new sanctions. As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine entered its fourth day, the US also expressed guarded optimism over talks between delegations from the two countries set to take place inside Ukraine, near the Belarusian border, on Monday. Speaking on ABC’s This Week, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, described the nuclear deterrence announcement as an example of Putin “manufacturing threats that don’t exist in order to justify further aggression”. In televised comments, Putin said he had ordered “the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty”, due to “aggressive statements” from Nato leaders. Analysts told the Guardian that while the order itself was not immediately clear, it was not indicative of preparation for a first strike. Psaki said: “At no point has Russia been under threat from Nato, has Russia been under threat from Ukraine, this is all a pattern from President Putin. And we’re going to stand up for it. We have the ability to defend ourselves, but we also need to call out what we’re seeing here from President Putin.” Biden administration officials expressed tentative support for planned talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, as announced by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told CNN’s State of the Union the US would “look forward to what comes out of those discussions. “As you know … we leaned in on diplomacy with the Russians throughout this process and we hoped that Putin would find a way to the negotiating table and he made the unfortunate decision of aggression over diplomacy.” Pressed on whether she believed the talks announcement indicated a good faith effort on behalf of Russia, Thomas Greenfield responded: “I can’t get into Putin’s head or into Russian reasoning, so it remains to be seen.” The talks announcement was tentatively welcomed by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who told CNN he had “absolute and full confidence” in Zelenskiy’s judgment on “whether it is right to sit down and find a political solution”. But Stoltenberg also expressed concerns about Russia’s motivations. “It remains to be seen whether Russia is really willing to make some serious compromises and also to respect the sovereignty of Ukraine,” he said. Stoltenberg characterized Putin’s decision to order Russia’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert as “dangerous rhetoric” and “a behaviour that is irresponsible”. The Biden administration has issued tough sanctions, targeting banks and the finances of some Russian oligarchs as well as restricting export of vital technologies key to Russian military and economic development. Over the weekend, the US and its European allies announced plans to target the Russian central bank’s foreign reserves and to block selected Russian financial institutions from the Swift messaging system for international payments. But the sanctions have not yet targeted oil and gas exports, which reportedly accounted for 36% of Russia’s annual budget last year. That has lead to criticism both inside the Ukraine and in the US. On Sunday Tom Cotton, a Republican senator from Arkansas and a prominent foreign policy hawk, urged the administration to continue to amplify sanctions. “It’s time for the president and some of our European partners to quit pussyfooting around,” he told ABC. “The financial sanctions announced last night are riddled with loopholes.” Cotton was also grilled on Donald Trump’s stance on the war. Trump, who often praised Putin while he was in the White House, finally condemned the invasion during a speech on Saturday night, but also continued to praise the Russian leader. Cotton refused four times to condemn or comment on Trump’s record. The Biden administration has not ruled out further sanctions and has alluded to further measures being taken as the war progresses. “The purpose of the sanctions are to put as much pressure on the Russian economy as possible. And we want to do as much as we can to protect the impact on our own economy,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “But we’re continuing to look at new and even harsher measures against the Russians.”",News/World news,US condemns Putin nuclear deterrence order but cautiously welcomes talks report,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/ukraine-russia-us-biden-putin-zelenskiy-nuclear-deterrenceorder-talks
2/28/2022,"When the air raid sirens wail, Natalya Tyshchuk feels relatively lucky. She only has to get herself and her daughter Mia – born three months premature in December but no longer in a cumbersome incubator – down to the basement that serves as a bomb shelter for the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in central Kyiv. Racing down the stairs beside them are nurses and families of premature babies in intensive care, who have to be rushed underground with their life support machines, oxygen canisters, and all the tubes and wires monitoring their fragile young lives. Tyshchuk is glad that her firstborn will have no memories of these traumatic days. “She is stressed of course, but I am happy that she is super-super-young and she won’t remember this,” she says in a phone interview from the shelter. “Its unexpected, it’s very hard to understand and it’s hard to live through.” The invasion began less than a week ago, but has already brought death and trauma to children across Ukraine; even if it stopped tomorrow a whole generation will bear scars from the destruction and terror of seeing their world torn apart. Up to 10 children have been killed in the fighting already. The first one named is a 4th grade girl from Kyiv, called Polina; a photo shared online showed a slight, smiling girl with streaks of pink in her hair. Her family car was shot by “Russian saboteurs” in the city, the deputy Kyiv mayor, Volodymyr Bondarenko, said in a Facebook post. Her brother has been taken for treatment at Okhmatdyt and her sister is in intensive care at a second hospital. Another child was killed by cluster munitions, along with two adult civilians, while the group were taking shelter at a nursery and kindergarten in the northern town of Okhtyrka, Amnesty International said. The munitions, widely banned under international law, appeared to have been fired by Russians. “You see, everyone is covered with blood, everything. Look at it,” one witness told the group. “It kills me the fact it’s a kindergarten. What’s this they shoot at? At military objects? Where are those?” The explosion raised fears that Russia’s military could bring to Ukraine some of the brutal tactics it used in Syria, where its troops recklessly bombed civilian targets including schools and hospitals. “It is stomach-turning to see an indiscriminate attack on a nursery and kindergarten where civilians are seeking safe haven. Plain and simple, this should be investigated as a war crime,” said Agnès Callamard, the secretary general of Amnesty International. “There is no possible justification for dropping cluster munitions in populated areas, let alone near a school. This … shows flagrant disregard for civilian life.” Hundreds of thousands of children are already out of school because of fighting, and some may no longer have teachers or classrooms whenever hostilities finally stop. Two teachers were killed by a missile that hit a school in eastern Gorlovka on Friday, and at least seven education buildings had been shelled already including the kindergarten in Okhtyrka, Save the Children said. “Schools must not become the battlefields where wars are waged and students are the casualties,” said Irina Saghoyan, Save the Children’s eastern Europe Director. Even the very youngest Ukrainians have been affected by the violence, with several born in bomb shelters this week as missiles slammed into cities above them. The health minister, Viktor Liashko, shared photos of two, of these new arrivals, calling them “the face of war”. “They will never forget, and we will never forgive,” he wrote. At the Okhmatdyt hospital, where Tyshchuk is with her daughter, dozens of children in treatment after premature birth, for cancer and other serious illnesses are crammed with a single carer into the basement bunker, designed by Soviet engineers in the 1970s to withstand potential cold war battles while keeping treatment going. The walls are thick enough to keep the war out, although the shelter is extremely basic, with no beds for the adults, or chairs or tables, Tyshchuk says. “Conditions are very minimal, but there is a feeling of security here. I sit on the floor, but there are no windows and the walls are thick, and we don’t hear any of the explosions except the very loud ones. “No one was expecting war, and so no one made preparations here. That’s why we have only what we have – medications, beds for children, all the necessary stuff.” The trauma of watching Mia fight for life in the neonatal unit appeared to be finally drawing to an end last week. Doctors told Tyshchuk she was nearly ready to be discharged, but then Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine. So the pair were stuck in the heart of the capital, the main target of the Russian military mission. Within a few short days she had picked up an uncomfortable familiarity with the sounds of destruction. She was feeding Mia on Saturday afternoon when there was a whistling rush outside. “It was a very strange sound, so I decided to hide under the window with my back to the wall,” she said. Moments later air raid sirens sounded and she headed back down the stairs. Despite the lack of comfort in the basement, she often stays there and tries to sleep rather than spend the night running up and down stairs. Covid rules still mean her husband cannot come to the hospital, so she must face the onslaught of bombs alone with her tiny daughter, although the pressures of the invasion may mean they are reunited sooner than she expected. “That is the hardest thing for me, having to do it on my own,” she said. “I expect I will be released from hospital on Tuesday, not due to health conditions of my child but to the war.”",News/World news,‘It’s stomach-turning’: the children caught up in Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/children-caught-up-in-ukraine-war
2/28/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the largest ground offensive in Europe since the second world war, has unleashed not one but two struggles. The first is the military conflict for the freedom of Ukraine. The second is the broader geopolitical contest. Neither is going as the Russian president hoped when he launched his shameful and unprovoked attack. But both are in their earliest days. The slow initial Russian advance and extraordinary scenes as artists pick up guns, bankers prepare molotov cocktails and unarmed people confront tanks are testament to Ukrainians’ passionate determination. But they are outgunned and outnumbered by a callous adversary that has already claimed the lives of children and other civilians and is pouring in more troops. The risks of a bloody, brutal war spreading beyond the borders are real. On Sunday, as President Volodymyr Zelinskiy agreed to a delegation meeting Russia for talks without preconditions, Mr Putin put his country’s nuclear deterrent forces on high alert – underscoring his lack of interest in de-escalation, concerns about his state of mind and the fact that his failure could bring more suffering too. Russia’s nuclear status precluded western countries committing troops to back non-Nato member Ukraine. But that did not stop Mr Putin raising it as a threat anyway. His aggression has so far brought about a strengthening of the Nato presence he reviles and seems to be reinvigorating the alliance, as former Soviet states, and others in the region, watch Ukraine fearfully. It has drawn US attention back from China, tying it more closely to Europe and vice-versa. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, called this “a turning point in the history of our continent” in his landmark speech on Sunday. Germany is not only shipping weapons to Ukraine, in a U-turn, but vowing a massive hike in defence spending, to more than 2% of GDP. It has agreed to cut off the access of some Russian banks to the Swift payment system, with Hungary too signing on; Czech president Miloš Zeman, once vocally pro-Putin, had already executed a remarkable volte-face. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, has pledged to paralyse the assets of Russia’s central bank – potentially far more damaging. Like the sweeping controls on technology exports announced by the US on Thursday, it could bring misery to Russians for a war that their president chose for them. Even if fighting can be contained, stark economic consequences could soon translate into political instability. Nations across the Middle East and Africa fear soaring wheat prices. China, despite pursuing a Sino-Russian relationship with “no limits”, abstained rather than vetoed the UN security council resolution decrying the war. It wants to reshape, not destroy, the international order, but sees benefits in distraction for a US increasingly hostile to Beijing and in growing multipolarity. New Delhi will not endanger its long relationship with Moscow, especially given the latter’s closeness to both Beijing and Islamabad. Mr Putin has also built up the relationship with Turkey, Brazil and others. His real win would come if high energy prices batter the US as well as Europe, damaging social and political cohesion, distracting the administration and winning another term for Donald Trump – shifting the country away from Nato and Europe. We may see a broader fracturing of the globalised economy, and increasing insularity: already, the pandemic and China’s rise are making politicians around the world contemplate increasing self-reliance and reduced dependence on long supply chains. The struggles Mr Putin has let loose are unfolding at an intense pace, yet will probably take years to settle. They are tests of both capabilities and resolve. Today, Ukraine is suffering. Tomorrow, repercussions could be felt around the globe.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Putin’s invasion: the struggle is only beginning | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/27/the-guardian-view-on-putins-invasion-the-struggle-is-only-beginning
