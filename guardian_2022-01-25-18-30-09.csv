1/25/2022,"I can’t imagine you aren’t across it, but in case you missed what the outgoing Australian of the Year Grace Tame did on Tuesday, let me run you through it. Tame went to the Lodge as part of the annual pre-Australia Day festivities. Naturally, her arrival was captured by waiting cameras. The prime minister extended his hand and congratulated the sexual assault survivor on her recent engagement to partner Max. Tame shook Scott Morrison’s hand without meeting his gaze.  Tame was stony faced, and seemed to take a very close interest in a spot on the ground away from Morrison. The prime minister piled more wattage into his smile, correcting for the lack of warmth adjacent to him, rendering the tableau even more unbalanced. Jenny Morrison, always gracious, also smiled at Tame, seeking to hold her gaze momentarily, and the young woman smiled back. Having traversed the grip and grin pleasantries in memorable and didactic fashion, a short session of steely side-eye ensued. In an era when everything is recorded, and everything is polarised, Tame’s decision to eviscerate Morrison with her body language was always going to be #AMoment™. And so it #Was. Social media exploded with #Feelings. Grace Tame is my spirit animal. That Grace Tame is a very rude young woman. James McGrath (a Liberal senator very few people will have ever heard of outside his home state of Queensland) took to Facebook to characterise Tame’s behaviour as “partisan, political and childish”. Striking a fresh blow in the outrage economy, and bringing more eyeballs to his page, McGrath declared: “If she didn’t like being Australian of the Year she should hand back the honour.” Hmm, yes. It is tempting at this juncture to observe that men can be so emotional. If you are an admirer of Tame, McGrath’s critique sounds very much like a tantrum. The Liberal senator’s rebuke was the sound of a door slamming as an irate teenager returned to his room. But depending on your point of view is the operative observation in that sentence. If Tame’s Lodge entrance was pointedly didactic, McGrath’s rebuke was performative. McGrath knows precisely who he’s offending with his Facebook #FU to #GT, and who in the community will tut-tut along sympathetically with his sentiments. That’s the problem with young people today. No manners. Peter van Onselen, political editor at Network 10, was also sufficiently moved to bash out a quick column for the Australian. Very enterprising of him – carving out an unexpected side hustle as the national broadsheet’s Lodge etiquette editor. Van Onselen felt Tame was “ungracious, rude and childish … refusing to smile for the cameras, barely acknowledging [Morrison’s] existence when standing next to him”. Brave, this righteous parsing of Tame’s manners, when you consider van Onselen is a journalist who believes he’s entitled to be rude to the prime minister any time he believes rudeness is warranted. Political commentators like van Onselen, like myself, like many of our peers, routinely deploy rudeness in order to nail a point that needs nailing. Rude is in fact part of the arsenal when you seek to serve truth. So I’m not sure why one Australian of the Year, nearing time on her tenure and determined not to waste her public platform, has different rules of engagement. That all seems pretty arbitrary. This point of view begs a lot of questions: who decides who can be rude and the circumstances in which rudeness is permissible? Who appointed the rude police? Can we appeal their rulings? In any case, I’ll keep my closing observations simple lest I irritate blokes who continue to lose their minds when women won’t stop talking. Tame’s finale, her Australian of the Year coda, was entirely as you’d expect. This recipient has shown absolutely no interest, at any point, in being transactional about her honour. She doesn’t seem to want a shiny badge in return for a head pat. Having been silenced in the most harrowing of circumstances, this woman wants to speak, on her own terms, and if she gets that opportunity, she will not waste it. I don’t know Grace Tame. I imagine she’s just as complex and flawed and difficult as the rest of us. But this much can be safely observed: the woman I’ve watched over the past year has zero interest in co-option, no people pleasing compulsion to be grateful, no instinct to genuflect before smug, self-satisfied systems or conventions. She exhibits some of the defining qualities of her generation. I know a lot of young women like Grace Tame – women who have not been socialised to shut up when an authority figure (generally a man) is talking. She is very recognisable to me. She resonates, because she feels like progress. This ornery quality Tame has, the absence of forelock tugging, the element of kinetic unpredictability, can make other people uncomfortable, not because she is wrong, or her cause unjust, but because Australians love rules. Rules keep everything comfortable and nice. Rules minimise the element of surprise. Australians like to think of ourselves as rebels – plain speakers, never standing on ceremony, devoid of stiffness. Culturally we are informal, but actually we love rules, and we aren’t always kind to rule breakers. Convention is our refuge. So what we learned on Tuesday was Grace Tame has managed to end her tenure as Australian of the Year continuing to teach us about ourselves. What an achievement that is.",News/Australia news,Young women like Grace Tame weren’t socialised to shut up when authority figures speak – and it feels like progress | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/young-women-like-grace-tame-werent-socialised-to-shut-up-when-authority-figures-speak-and-it-feels-like-progress
1/25/2022,"Gini Wijnaldum: nice guy, very handsome and not half bad at association football. But things haven’t gone well for the Dutchman since his move to PSG, where just 11 league starts under Mauricio Pochettino mean Wijnaldum is suddenly quite interested in his current manager’s old stomping ground: Tottenham Hotspur. Antonio Conte is so desperate for signings that he recently played Matt Doherty as a right winger as some form of dirty protest. Wijnaldum is a potential option, but a lot depends on whether PSG and Tottenham can arrange some sort of elaborate swap deal, which could involve any one of Tanguy Ndombele, Dele Alli and Julian Draxler. A Rumour Mill legend, Draxler has been threatening to come to the Premier League for nearly a decade now; could this be his time? Ndombele, Spurs’ record £55m signing in 2019, is keen on a return to France and the idea of actual silverware.  Newcastle’s transfer gurus have set their sights on the outline of Brighton’s Yves Bissouma, which while expensive, would be an entirely sensible signing. The Seagulls would reportedly be willing to do business at £50m, the same fee they demanded for Ben White, which would be a club record for Newcastle. Whether Bissouma would want to swap life in the top half of the table for a relegation battle is another matter. Speaking of club records, Arsenal are considering breaking theirs once more. Nicolas Pépé hasn’t exactly set the Premier League alight since his whopping £72m move from Lille, but with the Gunners in desperate need of a new frontman, the £75m release clause of Real Sociedad’s Alexander Isak is suddenly looking a little more appealing. This is also due to the fact that Dusan Vlahovic looks like he’s off to Juventus, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is woefully out of form and favour, and Alexandre Lacazette currently can’t hit a barn door. Aubameyang is back in London after his Afcon tribulations and posted on Instagram that “my heart is absolutely fine and I’m completely healthy” in an apparent come-and-get-me plea to anyone that is willing to listen. Barcelona have sent a lovely hamper round to César Azpilicueta’s house in an attempt to convince the Spaniard to sign on a free transfer this summer. Azpilicueta’s contract at Chelsea is up in the summer and he has yet to tell the club of his decision. ‘Dave’ is not the only Blues defender that could make the switch to Catalonia, with Xavi also interested in Andreas Christensen. In slightly less continental news, Tottenham will win the race to sign Lewes teenager Ollie Tanner, who has been in sensational form for the non-league side this season. A former Arsenal academy player, the 19-year-old has been scoring free-kicks for fun and looked set to sign for Brighton (and be loaned back to Lewes) before interest from Spurs developed.",Sport/Football,Football transfer rumours: Arsenal in for Isak as Vlahovic heads for Juve?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/25/football-transfer-rumours-arsenal-isak-juventus-vlahovic

1/25/2022,"Boris Johnson’s gathering with birthday cake in the cabinet room was not a party, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said, denying the prime minister had organised the event. “The prime minister clearly didn’t organise to be given a cake,” Shapps told Sky News after the latest revelations about lockdown breaches in Downing Street. “Some people came forward and thought it would be appropriate for on his birthday.”  But he suggested it was “unwise” for the prime minister have been given a cake at the gathering of staff. He told BBC Radio 4 Today that he shares “the sense of unease about all of this”. Asked if, at the time, he would have advised someone at a Downing Street press conference that the gathering as described would be allowed, Shapps said: “I think it’s clearly unwise to do those things…. This is in a workplace with a bunch of people who were working together all of the time, who decide to give the prime minister a birthday cake on his birthday. Unwise, I’m sure, given the circumstances as we know them.” Shapps confirmed that the event on 19 June 2020 would be considered by the official inquiry into the breaches by Sue Gray, saying she was “already aware of this particular incident, so she will be using that in her report and we’ll wait to see what she says”. He said the gathering revealed by ITV News, which was attended by the prime minister’s wife, Carrie, and interior designer, Lulu Lyttle, was with staff the prime minister had been “working with all day long, and will have been many a time in the same room with them working on the response to coronavirus … They come in, give him a cake, I understand I think it lasted for 10 minutes and that was it.” It came as the former prime minister Gordon Brown said Johnson’s apparent lockdown breaches were a “moral issue”, which resonated because people had not been able to spend time or say goodbye to people they love. “I could not go to the funeral of a very close relative last year at the same time,” he told Good Morning Britain. “I couldn’t visit a dying friend in hospital, and there are thousands and thousands of families who were in that position. “Therefore, this is not a political issue. This is a moral issue about whether the standards you ask people to follow are standards you are prepared to follow yourself.” Shapps said he still had confidence in Johnson, who is facing renewed anger from Tory colleagues and a possible vote of no confidence. He said the prime minister had “achieved remarkable things” but added “no one is perfect”. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, tweeted in support of Johnson on Monday night, saying: “So, when people in an office buy a cake in the middle of the afternoon for someone else they are working in the office with and stop for 10 minutes to sing happy birthday and then go back to their desks, this is now called a party?” The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said the behaviour of staff in Downing Street stood in contrast to how others had spent their birthdays. “Why should the Queen forgo her birthday party?” Lammy told the Today programme. The human rights lawyer Adam Wagner, an expert on Covid regulations, said on Twitter he “can’t see how it could have been lawful” if the reporting was accurate. “It’s obviously not within the rules and nobody from the government at the time would have said for a moment it was,” he said. If the facts of this are accurate then I can't see how it could have been lawful19 June 2020 - indoor gatherings of 2 or more were banned unless it fell within a list of exceptions. Birthday parties (or any social gatherings) were not an exceptionhttps://t.co/Qq2S9DLmhM https://t.co/6i7Xc9PB2U pic.twitter.com/o56QjqRlOJ Wagner told Sky News: “There are two questions you should ask, two thought experiments, first one is if the police had come across a gathering like this, with cake and food on the tables, and obviously social and arranged before in a particular room in a workplace but no one doing any work – what would they have done? I think the answer is they would have given everyone fixed-penalty notices. “And the other question to ask is if you had asked the PM or Matt Hancock or any of the officials that stood up at those regular briefings, we want to have a birthday gathering, a party, really, let’s call it what it is, in a work room, we’re going to pre-arrange it, we’re going to have cake and food, we’re going to stay there for half an hour, there will be 30 people indoors, at the time they would have said ‘absolutely not, that’s not within the rules’. And they would have been right”. Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the PM had no “moral authority” to lead the UK. Asked about the latest party allegations, he said: “I have reacted with a combination of despair and disgust really.” Drakeford said the singing had particularly resonated with him. “Amongst the hardest letters I had to read in the whole pandemic were from people telling me they had to attend a funeral where only eight people were able to be there, where it didn’t last 10 minutes, where you weren’t able to sing,” he said. “In Wales, a funeral without being able to sing is a really difficult experience. And yet those people stuck to the rules. It was hard but they did it.”",News/Politics,"Cake and singing on PM’s birthday was not a party, says Grant Shapps",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/25/cake-and-singing-boris-johnson-birthday-not-a-party-say-grant-shapps
1/25/2022,"The head of Queensland’s Crime and Corruption Commission, Alan MacSporran, has resigned seven weeks after a parliamentary committee found he failed in his duty to ensure the watchdog “acted independently and impartially”. Criticisms of the CCC and its priorities have increased in recent months following a series of failed prosecutions. The Queensland government had been considering whether to push ahead with a commission of inquiry into the organisation.  Other concerns about the CCC include the watchdog’s decision-making and the extent to which it focuses on high-level criminal investigations rather than institutional corruption. In December, the parliamentary crime and corruption committee (PCCC) recommended a commission of inquiry – with the powers of a royal commission – into the CCC following the failed prosecution of eight Logan city councillors last year. The councillors were charged with fraud in 2019 relating to former council chief executive Sharon Kelsey’s dismissal. The charges were discontinued in a Brisbane court last year. The parliamentary committee investigating the Logan affair stopped short of calling for MacSporran’s resignation – though it was proposed by counsel assisting during the committee hearings. The committee found the commission breached its duty to remain independent and impartial. It also found MacSporran’s failures to ensure the CCC acted impartially and independently were “serious” and reflected “poorly” on the commission. In a surprise statement on Tuesday, MacSporran said he would resign as the CCC chair. “Many people have urged me to continue in this important role, despite the recent finding contained in the report of the parliamentary crime and corruption committee,” he said. “However, I find myself in a position where, despite a career spanning in excess of 40 years, where my honesty and integrity have never been questioned, it is clear to me that the relationship between myself and the PCCC has broken down irretrievably. This saddens me deeply. “The Queensland community rightly expects the CCC to do its statutory job, and that ultimately involves making very complex, tough and independent decisions as an investigative agency. As chairperson, I was willing to make, and support my staff making, those independent decisions.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning MacSporran’s decision to quit comes just days after the Queensland integrity commissioner, Nicola Stepanov, resigned over concerns about interference with her office by the public services commission. The CCC suffered another embarrassment last week after charges of misconduct in public office against the former Moreton Bay mayor Allan Sutherland were dropped by prosecutors without him being committed for trial. Sutherland had denied any wrongdoing and claimed outside court the CCC was “out of control”. The failed prosecutions have emboldened critics of the CCC and damaged public faith in an institution charged with protecting the Fitzgerald Inquiry’s legacy in Queensland. In recent years, calls have increased for the CCC’s major crime and corruption functions to be separated. The watchdog investigates very few of the corruption complaints it receives – in more than 95% of cases it refers these back to various government departments.

The clerk of the Queensland parliament, Neil Laurie, said last year the CCC must “stop the drift” towards serious crime investigations and away from corruption matters. Questions have also been raised about the CCC’s apparent priorities. Last year, it finalised a two-year investigation into Queensland police hiring practices which it found discriminated against men. The investigation was criticised by the Queensland human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, who said the finding appeared to be based on an “incorrect” understanding of discrimination law, and that the CCC had in the process “(undermined) the legitimacy and lawfulness of equal opportunity measures”.",News/Australia news,Queensland’s Crime and Corruption Commission boss Alan MacSporran resigns,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/queenslands-and-corruption-commission-boss-alan-macsporran-resigns
1/25/2022,"Sue Gray is unlikely to produce the conclusion that many are hoping for. She should not be expected to do so. Her task is to discover the facts, not pronounce a verdict. The first issue on which she is asked to pronounce is whether the Downing Street parties broke either government guidance or the law, an offence for which many were fined. That, however, should not be a matter for her but for the police.  The Met gave two feeble excuses for not investigating. The first was that the parties were held long ago: as if a crime committed 18 months ago is exempt from investigation – good news for criminals who can cover their tracks. The second excuse was insufficient evidence. But where it seems that an offence has been committed, it is the Met’s job to search for evidence, which indeed was right in front of their eyes since police are present in Downing Street at all times and will have seen people coming and going. Gray, by contrast, has no professional qualifications as a detective or powers to compel the production of evidence, and so must rely on what is said to her, as Lord Geidt had to do in his inquiry into the furnishing of the Downing Street flat. In any case, Gray may be impartial but she is not independent. A former second secretary in the Cabinet Office, she is now a permanent secretary. She reports to the prime minister, who might well not look favourably on her promotion prospects if the report condemns him and he remains in office. Her boss is Simon Case, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, one of whose responsibilities is to evaluate her performance. It is, moreover, never right to rely upon one investigator, however eminent. A stronger constitutional check is needed on ministers and the prime minister – a permanent investigatory panel of three wholly independent people from outside the civil service, at least one of whom should be legally qualified. If the report turns out to be unfair to the prime minister, he has redress in parliament. Officials criticised in the report have no such redress. They cannot defend themselves in public and their careers and reputations could be severely damaged, if not ruined. The second issue on which Gray is to pronounce is whether Johnson deliberately deceived parliament. The ministerial code decrees that any minister guilty of this offence must offer their resignation to the prime minister. There is, however, no mechanism to enforce this rule against ministers, still less against the prime minister, and a non-elected official such as Gray is unlikely to take it upon herself to tell an elected prime minister that he must go. In theory, the prime minister could be prosecuted for the old common law offence of misconduct in public office. But there appears to have been no such prosecution of a politician since the early 19th century, and the courts would hardly intervene in what is, in the last resort, a political issue. For similar reasons, the weapon of impeachment has long fallen into a state of disuse. Johnson would not have been the first occupant of No 10 to have intentionally misled parliament. There is the case of Anthony Eden who, with his foreign secretary, Selwyn Lloyd, misled the Commons by denying collusion with Israel in the Suez invasion in 1956. They believed that otherwise the lives of British residents in Arab countries might be endangered. That the house did not hold it against them is shown by the fact that Lloyd was elected Speaker in 1971. In the days of fixed exchange rates, chancellors were regularly excused for not announcing that a government had decided to devalue the pound. John Profumo, however, was not forgiven in 1963 for misleading the house concerning his relationship with Christine Keeler. There is, then, no fail-safe mechanism to enforce the constitutional convention embodied in the ministerial code. It could in theory be enforced by a Commons vote of no confidence. More likely, however, is a vote of no confidence by Conservative MPs in a secret ballot. In normal times, ministers can rely on a solid phalanx of parliamentary support; but these may not be normal times. Scottish Conservative MPs appear to be particularly opposed to the prime minister, and there appears to be a growing rift between them and English Conservatives, a rift that could endanger the very union Conservatives are pledged to defend. But constitutional conventions depend in the last resort upon public feeling. Voters may conclude that the parties are of no real significance; or they may feel deep and long-lasting anger against those in authority who broke rules they themselves made and which the public observed, often at the cost of great stress and anguish. In that case they will tell Conservative MPs that Boris Johnson must go. It is not Sue Gray, or even Conservative MPs, who will decide the prime minister’s fate, but we the people.

1/25/2022,"In 1996, the US women’s basketball team won Olympic gold in Atlanta, providing a solid foundation for two professional leagues. The WNBA, which had the backing of the NBA and better marketing, outlasted the ABL and continues to this day. After their victory on home soil at the 1999 World Cup, the US women’s soccer team seized the spotlight and parlayed that attention into a professional league. That league collapsed, but waves of publicity over the next decade have yielded a solid fanbase determined to keep professional women’s soccer running.  So when will women’s ice hockey get its moment? Since the sport joined the Olympic program in 1998, North American rivals Canada and the US have dominated to an extent that makes Scottish soccer’s Rangers-Celtic lockdown on the top spots pale in comparison. Only once in the Olympics and only once in the world championships have the Big Two not faced each other in the final. Total solar eclipses happen more often than losses by either team to someone other than each other. With the two dominant countries in the sport sharing a border and already collaborating on the world’s top men’s league, the NHL, why have we not seen a viable fully professional women’s league? Why isn’t seven-time world champion and 2018 gold medalist Meghan Duggan, who now works for the NHL’s New Jersey Devils, as easily recognizable as Megan Rapinoe? When will women’s hockey have a professional league final with TV ratings to match the average of 548,000 for the 2021 WNBA finals or the 653,000 who watched the 2020 NWSL Challenge Cup final Professional hockey salaries briefly edged up to $25,000 for one year but immediately dropped back to the low five figures and below. For comparison’s sake, the NWSL (National Women’s Soccer League) has a minimum salary that has risen from four figures to $22,000, a number sure to go up with upcoming collective bargaining. The average salary in the WNBA is more than $120,000. Without living wages in the pro game, the US women turned instead to USA Hockey, earning a mammoth raise from $6,000 a year to $70,000 plus bonuses after a boycott threat in 2017. That’s still less than the $100,000 given to core US women’s soccer players on top of more than $70,000 in NWSL pay that, until next year, has been provided by US Soccer. In short, women’s hockey is now where women’s soccer was in the mid-2000s, with no full-fledged pro league and players depending on a national federation for money. Women’s soccer players can make living wages even if they’re not in the national team picture; women’s hockey players only get living wages if they’re in the select few. The US women’s soccer team will have increasing competition for places as players can stay in the game through their 20s; women’s hockey players have to scrounge to keep playing after college if they’re not already firmly established as international players. It’s not that no one’s trying. At the turn of the century, the National Women’s Hockey League emerged from Ontario and slowly spread across Canada, and its teams signed most of the Canadian women’s team members who weren’t still in college. By 2005, though, women’s hockey entered its phase of in-fighting and alphabet-soup leagues, a phenomenon all too familiar to those who’ve followed North American pro soccer. The NWHL’s western teams split to form the WWHL (Western Women’s Hockey League). A 2006 reunification didn’t stick, and the NWHL’s management problems culminated in a farcical game in Montreal that ended with 2:04 remaining because the home team had failed to book sufficient time for the game, forcing top-tier hockey players to clear the ice so the general public could skate. The WWHL boasted stars like Canadian Hayley Wickenheiser and US player Angela Ruggiero, both of whom were featured in the NHL13 video game, along with a US presence in the Minnesota Whitecaps. But it dwindled to three teams by 2009 and fizzled out. Back east, the CWHL (Canadian Women’s Hockey League) launched in 2007 and remained the de facto top-tier league despite its amateur status. In 2015, the NWHL name was revived south of the border, with four American teams competing and actual salaries on offer, ranging from $10,000 to $25,000. The next year, those salaries were cut in half, while the CWHL announced it would start paying players in the $2,000 to $10,000 range. Meanwhile, the CWHL expanded halfway around the world, bringing in two teams (later one) from China, where authorities were willing to shell out some money to develop the sport in time for the 2022 Olympics on home ice. With calls for a merger with the NWHL growing, the CWHL rendered the question academic by folding in 2019. (One Chinese team, the Shenzhen KRS Vanke Rays, continues to play in Russia’s Zhenskaya Hockey League and won the 2020 championship with the help of US national team players Alex Carpenter and Megan Bozek.) The drop to one North American league united the players, but that unity didn’t come in the NWHL. More than 200 players announced they would not play club hockey at all “until we get the resources that professional hockey demands and deserves,” they said in a sharply worded statement. So once again, we have two entities. One isn’t a league, per se. The PWHPA (Professional Women’s Hockey Players’ Association) puts together showcase events and exhibition games. In early 2021, national team players were involved, but this year, the US and Canada have residency programs. The NWHL has continued but had to cancel its 2020 championship between Boston and Minnesota due to Covid-19. The league attempted to play a two-week 2021 season in a bubble at Lake Placid, home of the 1980 Winter Olympics, but a rash of positive Covid tests forced an abrupt reformatting, and the playoffs moved to March in Massachusetts. Coincidentally, Boston and Minnesota again advanced to the final, with Boston winning 4-3. The league rebranded to the PHF (Premier Hockey Federation) in September and is playing a full 2021-22 season, albeit with the same Covid-related rescheduling that other sports leagues are facing. Signs of progress are emerging. Before rebranding, the PHF doubled salaries to an average of about $15,000. But is slow, incremental change enough to build the sport? Or does women’s hockey need that moment like the 1999 Women’s World Cup in soccer, and if so, how can that happen?",Sport/Sport,USA 1999 transformed women’s soccer.

The crime she was incarcerated for, committed when she was 10, was so heinous, so shocking, that her identity has been changed for her own safety. But as she puts it: “What’s the point of being safe if everything has been taken from you?” Michelle is trying to make a new life for herself as Samantha when an old friend of hers is murdered and her identity as the mixed-race murderer of a little white girl is leaked to the press, enraging the public. “She remembers the judge saying she’d shown no remorse. What’s remorse? she’d said, but no one had heard her. No one is hearing her now.” The Gosling Girl is one of the saddest, most moving thrillers I’ve read for some time. There is, it turns out, someone on Michelle’s side, black detective constable Natalie Tyler. Assigned to Michelle’s case and protection, she finds herself drawn to this desperately lonely girl and starts to ask questions about the past. Why did Michelle do it, and why was she the only one prosecuted, when there was someone else there too? Roy powerfully explores the repercussions of a childhood crime, exposing the racism that put Michelle in prison and which is still dogging Tyler today, forcing her into situations where she has to listen to people tell her: “I expect you think she got some kind of raw deal because she was black, that the trial was racist or some such thing. I know how you all stick together.” Carl NixonWorld Editions, £12.99, pp288 The Tally Stick starts with a genuine cliffhanger: John Chamberlain is driving his sleeping family – four children and his wife – along a wet road on New Zealand’s south island. It’s the middle of the night in April 1978 and the English family are exploring their new home before John starts his new job. Then their car skids off the road and ends up in a river, leaving the parents dead and the badly injured children at the mercy of the elements. They are not found until more than 30 years later, when the remains of eldest son, Maurice, are discovered, showing he had lived for four years after the family disappeared. A tally stick – a piece of scored wood – is found beside him. Nixon tells of what happened to the children after the crash – how they survived in this remote corner of the world and who found them.

All Was Lost is an exploration of what happens when a mother is pushed to the limits and how easily an ordinary person can turn to crime. “She’d been humiliated before and she’d been pushed… now with a gun and a purpose, she saw no reason not to push back. She was surprised by the sudden tempering of her spine.” Fast paced and shocking. Sophie HannahHodder & Stoughton, £16.99, pp368 I’ve followed the adventures of Sophie Hannah’s perennially gloomy pair of detectives, Simon Waterhouse and Charlie Zailer, from the start. In The Couple at the Table, they’re trying to get away from it all at a luxury, couples-only resort when they find themselves – surprise, surprise – investigating a murder. Jane, one of the guests, has received an anonymous note, warning her to “beware of the couple at the table nearest to yours”. But the alert is nonsense: of the five other couples present, no one’s table is closer or further away. Later that night, Jane, who, it turns out, is a nasty piece of work, is murdered. Despite the closed-room nature of the killing – no one has entered or left the resort and everyone has an alibi – months later the murderer still hasn’t been found. Simon, obviously, isn’t giving up, but it’s affecting the rest of his work. “You’re making this one failure – rare for you – last an unseasonably long time,” his awful boss, Proust, tells him. “Dipping into it over and over again, every day, like a slice of stale toast endlessly probing a rotten egg yolk.” But Simon presses on doggedly, as does Lucy, the woman whose husband left her for Jane, who just happened to be holidaying in the same resort. As much head-scratching fun as ever.  To order The Gosling Girl, The Tally Stick, All Was Lost and The Couple at the Table click on the titles or go to guardianbookshop.com.

1/25/2022,"The Marmite maker Unilever is planning thousands of job cuts as it comes under mounting pressure from a US activist investor and other shareholders to improve its performance. The FTSE 100 company, known for brands such as Dove soap, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream, intends to cut thousands of management roles across its operations, according to a source. They are expected to be in the “low thousands”.  Unilever employs about 150,000 people worldwide, including 6,000 in the UK and Ireland. The company declined to comment on the planned cuts, which were first reported by Bloomberg News. The chief executive, Alan Jope, has been under pressure for months to revive sales growth as the company missed its profit margin targets. In recent days it emerged that the US activist investor Nelson Peltz has built a stake in the troubled company. Jope had a tilt at GSK’s consumer health venture, but Unilever’s £50bn offer was rejected as too low by GSK and drew fury from shareholders, forcing the group to abandon its interest last week. The outspoken fund manager Terry Smith, the founder of Fundsmith and one of Unilever’s top shareholders, described the failed offer as a “near-death experience” and said management should focus on improving its core business – or step down. He had already declared that Unilever had “lost the plot”, accusing management of pursuing sustainability at the expense of business performance. As the furore built, Unilever rushed out a strategy update early last week in which it promised to grow its health, beauty and hygiene business and sell slower-growing operations. The statement hinted at the cuts: “Later this month we will announce a major initiative to enhance our performance. After a comprehensive review of our organisation structure, we intend to move away from our existing matrix to an operating model that will drive greater agility, improve category focus, and strengthen accountability.”",News/Business,Unilever plans thousands of job cuts as investors increase pressure,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/unilever-plans-thousands-of-job-cuts-as-investors-increase-pressure
1/25/2022,"Anthony Albanese has said Labor “will always be better” on health and education than the Coalition, in a signal the opposition will outbid the Morrison government on health funding leading into the 2022 federal election. The Labor leader made the comments at the National Press Club on Tuesday after a speech committing to a “strong, properly funded public health system, with Medicare as its backbone”.  Scott Morrison has urged Australians to “push through” the Omicron wave, but with a surge of cases over summer and new records set for hospitalisations and deaths, health has emerged as a weak spot for the Coalition despite lower Covid mortality in Australia than internationally. In October the Morrison government rejected a united call from all states and territories for an immediate funding boost to help them manage the “unrelenting strain” on health and hospital systems from the pandemic, labelling it “shakedown politics”. On Tuesday Albanese argued that the greatest lesson from the Covid-19 pandemic was “what a grave mistake it would be to take our public health system and Medicare for granted”.“Right now, our health workers are paying the price for some of the most serious public policy failures our country has seen,” he said. “They are overworked. They are exhausted.”Albanese said Australians “owe it to them to study what the pandemic has revealed about the vulnerabilities of our public health system – and strengthen it for the future”. “Right now, we could strengthen both the safety net and our sense that we are all in this together by making rapid antigen tests available free to every Australian through Medicare.”“Labor will always strengthen Medicare … a Labor government will deal with the damage inflicted by nine long years of neglect from this Liberal government.“Protecting the health of Australians will be a defining issue in the upcoming election. And a critical choice will be this: who do you trust to keep Medicare safe?” The comments raise the spectre of another election fought on trust over health funding, after Labor’s controversial claim the Coalition intended to privatise Medicare helped achieve an against-the-odds swing to the opposition. The Coalition labelled the claim a “cold-blooded lie”. Asked if Labor will provide more funding to hospitals, Albanese said: “Labor will always be better on health and education than our opponent.“We’ve already announced a range of policies out there. And there will be more to come.” Albanese said Labor saw the need for “an assessment” of the Covid response, but it would be appropriate to determine its form after “the heat of the pandemic” had passed. “Whether that be a royal commission or some form of inquiry, that will need to happen.” Albanese suggested another priority, if elected, would be “federation reform,” but declined to give specifics because “you can’t say that you want to work with the states and territories and then impose things from the commonwealth”. “We need a clearer delineation of who is responsible for what,” he said, arguing that despite funding and regulating aged care, the commonwealth still sought to blame states for outcomes in aged care. Although no progress has been made at national cabinet since the commonwealth rejected the hospital funding call, states including Victoria and Queensland will continue to press the issue. Stephen Duckett, director of the health and aged care program at the Grattan Institute, recommended a new long-term hospital funding agreement with state governments. He decried what he called “patch-up jobs” of short-term funding arrangements in recent years under the Coalition, saying the health system needed certainty into the future. “The Covid partnership agreement for 50% funding was a time-limited, narrowly defined agreement,” Duckett told Guardian Australia. “It doesn’t apply to 2022, when there will be a care deficit to deal with: of people who had their care deferred, elective procedures cancelled, or not fronted up to a GP because of Covid. “The underlying problems we’re seeing in front of us are the states don’t think the commonwealth is being fair to them. They’re having to shoulder more of the burden and think it should be 50-50.” Tim Woodruff, chair of the Australian Health Care Reform Alliance, called the previous funding arrangement “grossly inadequate” and suggested the 50-50 funding split be maintained. “[The hospital system] was struggling before Covid hit. We had long waiting lists if you had Medicare, and short waiting lists if you had private health insurance. The pressure with Covid has become immense,” he said. But Duckett warned that Labor “needs to be really careful” about their promises because “anything in hospitals, it costs a lot of money”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While states will push for more hospital funding, federal Labor is expected to announce measures to reduce out-of-pocket costs to attend the GP. Labor MP and former GP Mike Freelander told Guardian Australia he “strongly believes” the three areas of greatest priority are poor access and long wait lists for dental care, the gap costs of specialist care, and “making sure people can access GPs at a reasonable cost”. “People are losing their access to affordable care in outer metropolitan areas of Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne, and rural and regional areas,” he said. Freelander noted increased access to GPs would take pressure off hospitals, while more funding for hospital outpatient clinics would help reduce costs of specialist care.",News/Australia news,"Australian Labor ‘will always be better’ than Coalition on health, Anthony Albanese says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/australian-labor-will-always-be-better-than-coalition-on-health-anthony-albanese-says
