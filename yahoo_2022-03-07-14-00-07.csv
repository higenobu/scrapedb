3/7/2022,"A French restaurant says it's received threats based on confusion around its namesake dish. Poutine, fries doused in cheese curds and gravy, has nothing to do with Putin, it said. Businesses around the world have been pressured to cut ties with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. A restaurant in France seeks to clear its name after fielding confusion surrounding poutine, its signature dish — fries doused with cheese curds and gravy — and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the leader who announced an invasion into Ukraine just over a week ago. La Maison de la Poutine, or The House of Poutine, tweeted on Friday that it received ""calls of insults and even threats"" over its namesake dish. ""It, therefore, seems necessary for us to recall that La Maison de la Poutine is unrelated to the Russian regime and its leader,"" the tweet read. It featured the restaurant's logo, a heart emoji, and the Ukrainian flag. —La Maison de la Poutine (@MaisonPoutine) March 3, 2022 ""Our dish was born in Quebec in the 1950s. And the stories to tell its origin are numerous. But one thing is certain: poutine was created by passionate cooks who care about bringing joy and comfort to their customers,"" the restaurant, which runs two locations in Paris and one in Toulouse, wrote. The restaurant went on to offer its support to ""the Ukrainian people who are courageously fighting for their freedom against the tyrannical Russian regime."" Businesses and whole industries have been cutting ties with the Russian economy and its elite, as Western governments heap heavy sanctions on Moscow in response to Putin's attack on Ukraine. Last week, Quebec restaurant Le Roy Jucep joined the fray, saying it was removing the word ""poutine"" from its branding in protest of the invasion, according to Canadian daily the Ottawa Citizen. The diner, which claims to have invented poutine, said in a now-removed Facebook post that the dish would temporarily be called ""fries cheese gravy,"" per the Citizen. This isn't the first time a potato dish has been renamed over a political conflict: In 2003, French government resistance to the Iraq war led some restaurants — including three congressional cafeterias — to temporarily refer to French fries as ""Freedom fries."" A previous version of this article reported that the flag in the tweet was the Russian flag, when it is in fact the Ukrainian flag. We apologize for the error.

3/7/2022,"Ireland Baldwin is sharing how caffeine can trigger a host of health issues for her, including anxiety attacks. On Sunday, the 26-year-old model posted photos of herself curled up on her bathroom floor after suffering the after effects of drinking just ""one cup of coffee on an empty stomach."" The daughter of actors Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin went on to explain how coffee — which she admits drinking because ""I'm a silly goose"" — is a ""major esophageal irritator and reflux trigger for me, which leads to anxiety."" ""If you are an anxiety sufferer like myself, coffee isn't your friend,"" said Baldwin, who says she has to lie down ""until I can't cry or throw up anymore"" after a caffeine-trigged episode. ""Writing this and being open with y'all about my struggles helps it pass,"" she added, urging others with similar experiences to share. Indeed, many commenters noted that they too experience anxiety or even full-blown panic attacks after having coffee. The model's father, meanwhile, chimed in with a message of support, writing, ""I love you"" in response to her post. Baldwin, who shared a rare selfie with her actress mother over the weekend, has been candid about her mental health, from posting about self-love to sharing how social media can warp her view of herself. In January, she revealed that she has cardiophobia, admitting that she lives ""in a constant fear that I’m dying from a heart attack."" In addition to seeking treatment from anxiety specialists, using her own at-home blood pressure monitoring device has helped her find calm and distinguish the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as heart palpitations, from those of a cardiac episode. ""I just want anyone who suffers from their own anxieties to know that I am here and you are not alone. It can be so embarrassing and isolating at times,” she told her followers. “My anxiety has made me miss out on a lot in this life and my true 2022 goal is not let it get in my way. I have anxiety that is caused by food, my digestive system, my heart, big crowds, talking about anxiety, airplanes, you name it. You’re not alone. Hold on to your comfort item right. Don’t let people make you feel guilty for having to take a walk or take some space or stay home because you’re not feeling good. Surround yourself with people who understand or at least try to. And if you’re feeling anxious right now … deep breaths. You’re going to be OK.” Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox? Sign up here for Yahoo Life’s newsletter.",Health/Yahoo Life,Ireland Baldwin shares photos of herself having an anxiety attack after drinking coffee,https://news.yahoo.com/ireland-baldwin-coffee-caffeine-anxiety-210441968.html
