3/10/2022,"KUTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - When Russian tourist Konstantin Ivanov tried to draw money from his home bank account at a cash machine on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, the transaction was blocked. Unprecedented sanctions against Russia's banks over its invasion of Ukraine are taking a toll on its citizens overseas, who have been left scrambling to find cash or turn to crypto transactions to get by. ""This has created a huge problem for us. We have been left completely stripped of our finances - its like they have been completely frozen and we cannot use them at all over here,‚Äù said Ivanov, 27, adding that he might have to look for a job in Indonesia. The Russian embassy in the capital Jakarta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bali is a popular holiday destination with Russian tourists, who flocked to the island by the tens of thousands before the pandemic and were among the first to return when borders partially reopened last year. About 1,150 Russians entered Indonesia in January 2022, according to data from the statistics bureau. Rifki Saldi Yanto, the manager of a local cafe, said he had noticed a decline in Russian customers in recent days and many now pay with cash instead of credit card. Meanwhile more than 7,000 Russians were stranded in Thailand, another popular beach destination because of flight cancellations, a rouble currency in free-fall and payment issues. [L3N2VB1KZ] Russia's economy is facing its gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, after western countries moved in recent days to isolate it from the global financial system. International payments system SWIFT has disconnected several Russian banks from its network, while Visa and Mastercard said they were blocking overseas use of their cards issued by Russian banks from March 9.

3/10/2022,"By Philip Pullella VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican's Secretary of State told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in a phone call on Tuesday that the Holy See wants armed attacks in Ukraine to stop and humanitarian corridors to be guaranteed. A Vatican statement said Cardinal Pietro Parolin also repeated the Vatican's willingness ""to do anything"" to help bring about peace. The statement said the cardinal told Lavrov that Pope Francis was ""deeply worried"" about the war. Parolin appealed ""that armed attacks stop and that humanitarian corridors be guaranteed for civilians and rescue workers and that the violence of weapons be substituted by negotiations,"" the statement said. Ukrainian civilians began leaving two besieged areas on Tuesday after Russia opened ""humanitarian corridors"" for them, but Kyiv said Russian forces had shelled an evacuation route from the port city of Mariupol. Earlier, in its own statement about the call, the Russian foreign ministry said Lavrov set out Moscow's position on the conflict in Ukraine. Lavrov ""outlined the principled Russian position regarding the causes and goals of the special military operation being carried out in Ukraine"", the Russian statement said. Both parties expressed hope that a fourth round of talks between Moscow and Kyiv would be held as soon as possible to agree on the main problems underlying the crisis and to stop hostilities, the Russian ministry added. Ukraine has said it would welcome Vatican mediation and Parolin, who ranks second to Pope Francis in the Vatican hierarchy, has said previously it is willing to ""facilitate"" dialogue"" between Russia and Ukraine. Parolin has previously described the war as having been ""unleashed by Russia."" Francis has not yet blamed Russia by name publicly but has implicitly rejected Moscow's use of the term ""special military operation"" for its invasion of Ukraine. ""In Ukraine, rivers of blood and tears are flowing. This is not just a military operation but a war which sows death, destruction and misery,"" Francis said in his weekly address to crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square on Sunday. Francis has dispatched two cardinals to help distribute aid to refugees fleeing Ukraine and both have said they will try to enter the country. The Vatican and the then-Soviet Union began a dialogue in earnest after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, with former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev visiting Pope John Paul II that year. Full diplomatic relations with Russia were established in 2009 and have been cordial. Relations between the Vatican and the Russian Orthodox Church were at first spotty after the break up of the Soviet Union but have improved significantly in recent years. In 2016 Francis became the first pope to meet a leader of the Russian Orthodox Church since the great schism that split Christianity into Eastern and Western branches in 1054.
