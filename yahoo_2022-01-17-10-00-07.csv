1/17/2022,"The Queen may never meet her great granddaughter Lilibet or see her great grandson Archie again, after the Duke of Sussex announced he will not bring his family to Britain unless he receives police protection. The Duke is threatening to sue the Home Office over its refusal to provide security on his visits to the UK. He has insisted he has offered to pay for the Scotland Yard protection officers himself, but that his offer has been declined. Home Office sources said they did not recognise Prince Harry’s characterisation of the disagreement over his security arrangements. But the refusal of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to fly to the UK from their home in California until the security row is resolved means the Queen will not meet her great granddaughter Lilibet any time soon. The Duke and Duchess’ second child was born in the US and will turn one in June this year. Her brother Archie was born in May 2019 but has not been back to the UK since his parents initiated their infamous “Megxit” in January 2020. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on speculation over whether the Queen may be upset that her grandson and family would not be returning to Britain. In a statement, an unnamed legal representative for Prince Harry said: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable to return to his home.” The legal representative said the Duke had “inherited a security risk at birth”, pointed out he had “served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan” and that his family has been subjected to “well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats” in recent years. He added: “He remains willing to cover the cost of security, as not to impose on the British taxpayer. As is widely known, others who have left public office and have an inherent threat risk receive police protection at no cost to them. “The goal for Prince Harry has been simple – to ensure the safety of himself and his family while in the UK so his children can know his home country. “During his last visit to the UK in July 2021 – to unveil a statue in honour of his late mother – his security was compromised due to the absence of police protection, whilst leaving a charity event. “After another attempt at negotiations was also rejected, he sought a judicial review in September 2021 to challenge the decision-making behind the security procedures, in the hopes that this could be re-evaluated for the obvious and necessary protection required.” Lawyers for the Duke filed a “pre-action protocol” that will - should the courts grant it - result in a judicial review. Such reviews can typically cost £100,000. Lawyers for the Duke believe the refusal to give him protection has been unreasonable, opaque and inconsistent. They also insist he faces a greater threat in the UK than the US and that vital security information is not being shared with his private security team. On Sunday, government sources indicated that ministers did not agree with the Duke's characterisation of the disagreement over his security arrangements. However, they would not be drawn on what arguments the Home Office intended to make in any legal dispute. A spokesman said: ""The UK Government's protective security system is rigorous and proportionate. ""It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements. To do so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals' security. It would also not be appropriate to comment on the detail of any legal proceedings."" Dai Davies, the former head of Royal protection at the Metropolitan Police, said: “There is a system and, as I understand, it has been applied. “The vast majority of people will say you made your bed and now you have to go and lie in it in California. “The idea that London is more dangerous than California is wrong. I have worked in California and I have visited many times. It has far more dangerous firearms and criminals than the UK.”",World/The Telegraph,The Queen may never meet Lilibet as Prince Harry refuses to return to UK amid security row,https://news.yahoo.com/queen-may-never-meet-lilibet-204415446.html
1/17/2022,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has left the door open for Novak Djokovic to compete at next year's Australian Open despite the tennis superstar facing an automatic three-year ban from entering the country. The world number one player left Australia late on Sunday after the Federal Court upheld the government's decision to cancel his visa, capping days of drama over the country's COVID-19 entry rules and his unvaccinated status. Under immigration law, Djokovic cannot now be granted another visa for three years unless the Australian immigration minister accepts there are compelling or compassionate reasons. ""I'm not going to precondition any of that or say anything that would not enable the minister to make the various calls he has to make,"" Morrison told 2GB radio on Monday as Djokovic was en route to Dubai. ""It does go over a three-year period, but there is the opportunity for [a person] to return in the right circumstances, and that will be considered at the time."" The unanimous ruling by a three-judge Federal Court bench dealt a final blow to Djokovic's hopes of chasing a record 21st Grand Slam win at the Australian Open, which starts on Monday, dismaying his family and supporters. In a rollercoaster ride, the world's top men's player was first detained by immigration authorities on Jan. 6, ordered released by a court on Jan. 10 and then detained again on Saturday pending Sunday's court hearing. Djokovic, 34, said he was ""extremely disappointed"" by the ruling but he respected the court's decision. ""I am uncomfortable that the focus of the past weeks has been on me and I hope that we can all now focus on the game and the tournament I love,"" Djokovic said in a statement before flying out of Melbourne. Immigration Minister Alex Hawke had said Djokovic could be a threat to public order because his presence would encourage anti-vaccination sentiment amidst Australia's worst coronavirus outbreak. The Federal Court judges noted their ruling was based on the lawfulness and legality of the minister's decision, but did not address ""the merits or wisdom"" of the decision. They are yet to release the full reasoning behind their decision. The Serbian tennis player's visa saga has fuelled global debate over the rights of people who opt to remain unvaccinated as governments take measures to protect people from the two-year pandemic. Djokovic had been granted a visa to enter Australia, with a COVID-19 infection on Dec. 16 providing the basis for a medical exemption from Australia's requirements that all visitors be vaccinated. The exemption was organised via Tennis Australia and the Victoria government. That exemption prompted widespread anger in Australia, which has undergone some of the world's toughest COVID-19 lockdowns and where more than 90% of adults are vaccinated. POLITICAL TOUCHSTONE The controversy became a political touchstone for Morrison as he prepares for an election due by May, amid wrangling over responsibility between his centre-right federal coalition government and the centre-left Victoria state government. Morrison on Monday defended his handling of the situation, and differentiated Djokovic's case from vaccine sceptics within his own government. ""If you’re someone coming from overseas, and there are conditions for you to enter this country, then you have to comply with them,"" he said. ""This is about someone who sought to come to Australia and not comply with the entry rules at our border."" The saga also caused a spat between Canberra and Belgrade, with Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic calling the court decision ""scandalous"". The men's tennis governing body ATP said the decision ""marks the end of a deeply regrettable series of events"", adding it respected the decision, a comment echoed by Tennis Australia. On the tennis circuit, fellow players had become impatient for the media circus to end. ""The situation has not been good all round for anyone. It feels everything here happened extremely last minute and that's why it became such a mess,"" said former world No. 1 Andy Murray.

1/17/2022,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is negotiating a plea deal in his corruption case, a person involved in the talks said Sunday. The deal, which could be signed as early as this week, could usher Netanyahu off the Israeli political stage for years, paving the way for a leadership race in his Likud party and shaking up Israeli politics. Any deal could spare Netanyahu an embarrassing and protracted trial over an issue that has gripped the nation and risks tarnishing his legacy. Reports of a deal angered critics who said a it would undermine the rule of law. “The man who worked to destroy the public’s trust in the foundations of democracy for personal reasons is not eligible for deals,” Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz tweeted. He was referring to Netanyahu’s attempts after he was indicted to cast doubt on Israel’s justice system, saying it was biased and pursuing a witch hunt against him. Demonstrators gathered against the developing deal outside the attorney general’s house Saturday evening. Any deal will likely be challenged in court. A spokesman for Netanyahu declined to comment. Netanyahu is on trial for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. The former premier, now opposition leader, denies wrongdoing. The person involved in the negotiations said the plea deal would drop the bribery and fraud charges and scrap one case entirely. The person asked for anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the details of the talks. He said a plea deal would likely be announced in the coming days. The person said a number of elements remained unresolved, including the inclusion of the charge of “moral turpitude,” which under Israeli law would ban Netanyahu from politics for seven years. They were also deliberating whether Netanyahu would be forced to do community service under the deal. Including “moral turpitude” would challenge Netanyahu's vows to return to lead the country after his 12-year reign was ended last year by a coalition of ideologically disparate parties with little in common other than its opposition to his leadership. But Netanyahu, dubbed a political wizard for his ability to survive repeated attempts at ending his rule, could make a comeback when the ban expires. He would be nearly 80. His departure from the political scene would set off a leadership race in the Likud party, with several lawmakers already promising to run. Likud isn't expected to remain as dominant without Netanyahu, but would still be a major force under a new leader. With Netanyahu gone, the more nationalist elements of the coalition could decide to break off from the fragile union and opt to join forces with their ideological brethren. Netanyahu is charged in three separate cases. The first alleges that Netanyahu received gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from wealthy associates. In the second case, Netanyahu is accused of orchestrating positive coverage in a major Israeli paper in exchange for promoting legislation that would have harmed the news outlet’s chief rival, a free pro-Netanyahu daily. The third, nicknamed Case 4000, alleges that Netanyahu promoted legislation worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the owner of Israeli telecom giant Bezeq in exchange for positive coverage on its Walla news site.",World/Associated Press,Netanyahu negotiating plea deal in corruption trial,https://news.yahoo.com/netanyahu-negotiating-plea-deal-corruption-092522178.html
1/17/2022,"Never forget the basics. While we’re constantly bombarded with confusing investment mumbo jumbo, we should never forget that companies largely exist for one main reason: to take capital from investors and earn a return on it. That’s why it makes sense for investors to look for businesses, with durable competitive advantages, that are able to consistently deliver high returns on capital. As Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett once said, “[T]he best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return.” With that in mind, here are three Berkshire holdings with double-digit returns on invested capital. With returns on invested capital consistently in the mid-20% range, credit rating leader Moody’s leads off our list. Moody’s shares held up incredibly well during the height of the pandemic and are up nearly 220% over the past five years, suggesting that it’s a recession-resistant business worth betting on. Specifically, the company’s well-entrenched leadership position in credit ratings, which leads to outsized returns on capital, should continue to limit Moody’s long-term downside Moreover, Moody’s has generated about $2.4 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow. And over the first three quarters of 2021, the company has returned $975 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As of Q3 2021, Berkshire holds more than 24.6 million shares of Moody’s worth just under $8.8 billion. Moody’s has a dividend yield of 0.7%. Next up, we have consumer technology gorilla Apple, which boasts a five-year return on invested capital of 28%, much higher than that of rivals like Nokia (-3%) and Sony (12%). Even in the cutthroat world of consumer hardware, the iPhone maker has been able to generate outsized returns due to its loyalty-commanding brand and high switching costs (the iOS experience can only be had through Apple products). And with the company continuing to penetrate emerging markets like India and Mexico, Apple’s long-term growth trajectory remains healthy. In the most recent quarter, Apple’s revenue jumped 29% to $83.4 billion. The company also returned over $24 billion to shareholders. The stock currently sports a dividend yield of just 0.5%, but with a buyback yield of 3%, Apple is doling out more cash to shareholders than you might think. It's no wonder that Apple is Berkshire's largest public holding, owning more than 887 million shares in the tech giant worth roughly $125.5 billion. Rounding out the list is consumer staples giant Procter & Gamble, with a solid five-year average return on invested capital of 13.5%. Berkshire held 315,400 shares at the end of Q3, worth around $44 million at today’s price. While that’s not a big position by Berkshire standards, something does make P&G stand out: the ability to deliver rising cash returns to investors through thick and thin. The company offers a portfolio of trusted brands like Bounty paper towels, Crest toothpaste, Gillette razor blades and Tide detergent. These are products households buy on a regular basis, regardless of what the economy is doing. In April, P&G’s board of directors announced a 10% increase to the quarterly payout, marking the company’s 65th consecutive annual dividend hike. P&G share currently offer a dividend yield of 2.2%. 4 Ways to Earn Big Returns in 2022 Without the Shaky Stock Market Jim Rogers: Next Bear Market Will Be ‘Worst in My Lifetime’ — He'll Rely on 3 Assets Robert Kiyosaki Says We're Already in a 'Technical Depression' — He's Using These 3 Assets for Protection This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

1/17/2022,"SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (AP) — Several hundred migrants who had departed from the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula Saturday in hopes of reaching the United States entered Guatemalan territory where they were intercepted by authorities who began talks on returning them to their homelands. Some 300 migrants, mainly Hondurans and Nicaraguans, arrived in Corinto, Honduras Saturday afternoon and crossed into the Guatemalan border province of Izabal, where they were met by hundreds of anti-riot agents from the national police and army. The Guatemalan Migration Institute said it was in talks with the migrants on returning them to their countries of origin. Those who wish to remain in Guatemala must present their personal identification document, vaccination card and a negative test for the coronavirus. “People are being returned, everything in order, humanely,” said institute general director Carlos Emilio Morales. “We are protecting our borders; we are protecting the health of all Guatemalans.” Guatemala's government said 36 people were deported to Honduras because they did not meet the requirements and a group of 10 who met immigration and health requirements were allowed to continue. The migrants had begun their journey toward the U.S. from San Pedro Sula shortly after dawn Saturday, walking to the Guatemalan border in hopes that travelling in a group would be safer or cheaper than trying to hire smugglers or trying on their own. They were joined by a second smaller group. Fabricio Ordoñez, a young Honduran laborer, said he had joined the group in hopes of “giving a new life to my family.” “The dream is to be in the United States to be able to do many things in Honduras,” he said, adding he was pessimistic that left-leaning President-elect Xiomara Castro, who takes office on Jan. 27, would be able to quickly solve the Central American nation’s economic and social problems after 12 years of conservative administrations plagued by scandal. “They have looted everything,” he said. “It is going to be very hard for this government to improve things.” Nicaraguan marcher Ubaldo López expressed hope that local officials would not try to hinder this group, as they have in the past. “We know this is a very hard road and we ask God and the Honduran government to please accompany us to the border with Guatemala and not put more roadblocks,” he said. He said he hoped that Guatemala and Mexico also would allow the group to pass and that the U.S. government “will open the doors to us” — despite repeated recent examples of regional governments, often under U.S. pressure, trying to halt such caravans. The caravan, which is the first to be registered this year, originally had about 600 members but divided into several groups to try to evade the control of the Guatemalan authorities and go through the different border crossings and illegal routes. Large numbers of migrants, many from Central America and Haiti, have reached the U.S. border over the past year, creating a headache for the administration of President Joe Biden. In December, 56 migrants died when a truck carrying more than a hundred foreigners overturned on a highway in southern Mexico. The U.S. Border Patrol has said it had more than 1.6 million encounters with migrants along the Mexican border between September 2020 and the same month in 2021 — more than four times the total of the previous fiscal year. Biden has backed proposals for $7 billion in aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras in hopes improved economic conditions will slow migration. At the end of last year, the U.S. government reactivated an immigration policy that forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their hearings. Mexico's foreign ministry confirmed the reactivation of the U.S. program and said it would temporarily not return migrants to their countries of origin for humanitarian reasons. The government of Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has indicated that Washington has accepted its humanitarian concerns with the program, including the need for “greater resources for shelters and international organizations, protection for vulnerable groups, consideration of local security conditions"" as well as vaccines and anti-COVID-19 measures from migrants.",World/Associated Press,Migrant caravan from Honduras stopped in Guatemala,https://news.yahoo.com/hundreds-migrants-set-off-honduras-204534914.html
