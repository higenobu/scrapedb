4/20/2022,"When Nigeria-born, Atlanta-based Tope Awotona launched the meeting scheduling service Calendly in 2013 he believed in his idea so much that he used his entire life savings to launch the startup. The idea grew out of Awotona’s own challenges keeping track of his schedule. A lot of other people needed appointment scheduling services — today, the platform has 10 million users. In 2021, the scheduling app had achieved a $3 billion valuation. The company was founded in Atlanta and has been profitable since 2016, according to Forbes. Among Calendly’s corporate clients are Lyft, Ancestry.com, Indiana University, and La-Z-Boy. Revenue for 2021 exceeded $100 million. Last year, Calendly also raised $350 million in funding from OpenView Venture Partners and Iconiq Capital. Awotona’s majority stake is worth at least $1.4 billion, calculates Forbes. Awotona is one of just two Black tech billionaires in the U.S. The other is David Steward, 70, who is the founder of Missouri-based IT provider World Wide Technology. Awotona, 40, was born in Lagos, Nigeria. His father was a microbiologist and entrepreneur and his mother worked at the central bank. Awotona moved with his mother to Atlanta when he was 15. His father was killed three years earlier in a carjacking. Awotona went on to study computer science at the University of Georgia before switching to business and management information. Nine years ago, while selling software for EMC Awotona has socked away a life savings of $200,000. He sunk all of it into starting Calendly. Awotona found he needed a scheduling tool and figured other busy people did as well, so he created one. “The obvious idea to me was that scheduling is broken,” he says. In 2013, he debuted Calendly from Atlanta Tech Village, a coworking space for entrepreneurs. He maxed out his credit cards and withdrew money from his 401(k) to fund the startup. It was a risk, and Awotona knows it.

4/20/2022,"Russian chess legend Garry Kasparov on Monday explained what may lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ouster by his inner circle in a “palace coup.” CNN’s Paula Reid asked the longtime Putin critic and political activist if he expected to see more anti-Kremlin sentiment building in Russia as its invasion of Ukraine falters. “Eventually, yes,” replied Kasparov, a chess grandmaster for the former Soviet Union and Russia. Kasparov then laid out “the order of moves that cannot be reversed.” “First, the Russian public and Russian elite, they have to recognize the war is lost,” he said. “The bad news coming from Ukraine will inspire more people to rise because economic hardship will increase.” “So, military defeat in Ukraine, social-economic revolt and then you will have conditions, the right conditions, for a palace coup,” Kasparov predicted. “Because many of Putin’s inner circle will be looking for a scapegoat and it’s always a dictator who should be blamed for all the failures.” Putin knows losing the war on Ukraine “is not an option for him,” said Kasparov. “It’s a matter of political survival and in many cases … of physical survival,” he added. “That’s why he has to pretend he is winning the war.” Watch the interview here: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

4/20/2022,"Gov. Ron DeSantis said Florida could take action against Twitter's board for its ""poison pill."" The board of directors employed the defense technique to stave off Elon Musk's bid for the company. Florida's state pension fund holds just under 1 million shares of Twitter, per Bloomberg. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a press conference Tuesday that the state will attempt to hold Twitter's board of directors ""accountable"" for their poison pill defense against Elon Musk's potential hostile takeover. A poison pill, otherwise known as a shareholder rights plan, would dilute the value of each share in a company by allowing existing shareholders to buy more stock at a sizable discount. That would also dilute the holdings of Elon Musk, who became Twitter's largest shareholder earlier this month with a 9.2% stake. The idea is to make Twitter a less attractive acquisition target to stave off Musk's unsolicited push to buy the company. Florida's state pension fund holds 949,690 shares in Twitter as of Dec. 31, according to Bloomberg. ""I think that's probably an injury to the fund, so we're gonna be looking at ways that the state of Florida, potentially, can be holding this Twitter board of directors accountable for breaching their fiduciary duty,"" DeSantis said. Musk has said he will not continue paying Twitter's board members if he acquires Twitter. The members make a collective $3 million, with each individual salary ranging from $250,000 to $300,000. Musk offered to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share last week, and Twitter's board jumped to the defense to stave off a potential buyout. The whole debacle has taken on political undertones, with Republicans — including DeSantis — positing that Twitter's board wishes to keep Musk's hands off the deed to Twitter over free speech concerns. ""They rejected it because they know that they can't control Elon Musk,"" DeSantis said at the press conference Tuesday. ""They know that he will not accept the narrative and that their little play toy of Twitter, it would not be used to enforce orthodoxy and to basically prop up the regime and these failed legacy media outlets.""

4/20/2022,"(Reuters) - CalPERS, the largest U.S. public pension fund, on Tuesday said it will vote for a shareholder proposal that Berkshire Hathaway Inc replace Warren Buffett as chairman, though he would remain chief executive officer. The fund, whose full name is the California Public Employees' Retirement System, disclosed its vote in a regulatory filing ahead of Berkshire's scheduled April 30 annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. CalPERS said it invests more than $450 billion, including more than $2.3 billion in Berkshire shares. Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In proposing to install an independent chair at Berkshire, the nonprofit National Legal and Policy Center said the roles of CEO and chairman are ""greatly diminished"" when one person holds both. Berkshire opposes the proposal. It has said someone outside management should be chairman after Buffett is no longer in charge, but that the billionaire should remain chairman and CEO. Buffett, 91, has run Berkshire since 1965. Berkshire plans for Buffett's son Howard Buffett to become non-executive chairman after his father's departure, while Vice Chairman Greg Abel is slated to become CEO. Shareholder proposals that Berkshire opposes are generally defeated by large or overwhelming margins. Buffett recently controlled about 32% of Berkshire's voting power, while owning about 16% of its stock. CalPERS said it will also vote for shareholder proposals that Berkshire report on its plans to reduce greenhouse gases and improve diversity, and its own proposal that Berkshire report on its plan to handle climate risk. Berkshire opposes these proposals. CalPERS also plans to withhold votes to reelect directors Susan Decker and Meryl Witmer because of a lack of disclosures related to climate change. The fund backed U.S. company directors 72% of the time in 2021, according to the research firm Insightia.
