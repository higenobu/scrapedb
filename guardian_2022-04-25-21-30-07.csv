4/25/2022,"Amid a breathless finish to the Serie A season, spare a thought for your narrators who don’t know where to begin. In Empoli, where Napoli surrendered their title bid by conceding three times in seven minutes to opponents who had not won a game since December? Or at San Siro, where Inter thumped a Roma side led by Jose Mourinho, the man who led them to the treble, and who arrived on a 12-game unbeaten run? Perhaps we should start in Rome, where Milan kept the title race alive with a 91st-minute strike from a 21-year-old midfielder who almost signed for Inter? Then again, was the most memorable image of this weekend not the one from Salernitana’s Stadio Arechi, where Davide Nicola threw his shoe in frustration before clutching it on the sideline and menacing his players to improve? Even without such meme material, the manager deserves to be noticed. Nicola took over Salernitana in February, inheriting a team who were last Serie A with three wins from 23 games. They have doubled that number in the last eight days, beating Sampdoria, Udinese and Fiorentina. The same person previously rescued Crotone from the drop after sitting on 14 points after 29 games. He saved Genoa and Torino in the past two seasons as well. How could our attention linger long on the bottom of the table, though, when there is so much happening at the top? Inter’s victory over Roma on Saturday felt at the time like a decisive step toward retaining their title, an emphatic 3-1 victory over opponents who had not lost a league game since January. Mourinho was expected to take centre stage on this latest return to his old stomping ground, yet the most telling moment of the evening might have arrived in the 73rd minute, when a San Siro crowd that had scarcely acknowledged him – outside of a brief applause when his name was read out by the PA – opened up in a full-throated chorus of his name. As Mourinho said himself at full-time, the chant arrived only “when the fans were not afraid of us anymore.” By then, Inter were 3-0 up and cruising, having buried the Giallorossi with goals from Denzel Dumfries, Marcelo Brozovic and Lautaro Martínez. Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s late consolation for Roma arrived only after Simone Inzaghi had subbed off four starters, resting legs for Wednesday’s game against Bologna. Inter’s show of strength arrived just three days after they had eliminated Milan from the Coppa Italia with a 3-0 win in the semi-final’s second leg. Inzaghi confessed he had “feared this match” coming so soon after the derby, but his players showed no such nerves. Now the pressure shifted to Napoli and Milan. The Partenopei had the easier fixture, on paper, facing an Empoli team who were without a win in 17 matches across all competitions. But the devil was in the detail. Their last league victory had come against Napoli, at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. A repeat did not appear likely as Napoli took control with goals from Dries Mertens and Lorenzo Insigne either side of half-time. But with 10 minutes to go, they self-destructed. First Kevin Malcuit gave the ball away, initiating an Empoli move that ended with Liam Henderson drilling a shot into the bottom corner. Then the goalkeeper, Alex Meret, dawdled over a clearance, offering Andrea Pinamonti a chance to block. The ball rebounded off the striker and rolled across the line for 2-2. Pinamonti completed the turnaround when he slid in to convert a cross from the right. How fitting that it should be him, a striker on loan from Inter, doing his bit to help his parent club hold on to their title. With 12 Serie A goals, the 22-year-old is making his case to be given a chance back at San Siro next season. When Milan fell a goal behind after just four minutes at Lazio in Sunday’s evening game, it felt as though the title race might be ending. Scoring goals has been a struggle for the Rossoneri, just times in the preceding eight games, so a comeback could never be straightforward. Although they quickly pressed their opponents into retreat after Ciro Immobile’s opener, every action seemed rushed, all composure deserting them when a final ball was needed. The picture changed only after the interval, when Rafael Leão tamed a long pass from Theo Hernández, took a touch and cut back a pass toward the near corner of the six-yard box. Salernitana manager Davide Nicola took off his shoe to threaten one of his players like an old Nonna pic.twitter.com/Nh6NOwvmbv Arriving was Olivier Giroud. Him again, a striker who had only scored eight times this season for Milan and yet somehow always seems to show up when Milan need him most – away to Napoli, at home to Roma and most famously with a pair of goals in the derby win over Inter this February. He slid in to beat a wrong-footed Thomas Strakosha. The match was in Rome but a protest by home supporters against ticket price hikes meant there were more Milan fans inside the Olimpico. The volume raised and so did the pressure on the Lazio goal, Junior Messias firing a shot just wide and Leão demanding a reaction save from the keeper. A draw was not good enough. Only a win would put Milan back two points ahead of Inter at the top, pending their rivals’ game in hand. They found it in injury-time, Tonali showing impressive balance as he controlled a knock-down on his thigh while falling backwards, getting just enough on the ball to send it over the line. He tore off his shirt as he ran to his team’s supporters. It was the story of a season captured in a weekend. Mourinho has an acknowledged bias toward Inter, but his assessment on Saturday that they are “the strongest” team in Serie A rings true. Their superior talent defined the game against Roma, who had no answers to the control and creativity of Brozovic, Hakan Calhanoglu and Nicolò Barella in the middle nor to Ivan Perisic and Denzel Dumfries on the flanks. Napoli are one of few teams who can boast a comparably talented first XI, but in key moments of the season, they have simply been too brittle. Milan, despite continued improvement from young core, are probably still a step behind in their development, but have stayed the course with a blend of youthful defiance embodied by Tonali and decisive contributions from the veteran Giroud. How this tale ends remains open. Inter have the easier run-in, facing only teams from the bottom half of the table, whereas Milan’s opponents all currently occupy a spot in the top 10. Inzaghi’s team also control their own destiny and will go top if they beat Bologna on Wednesday. But Milan have the points on the board. “Winning doesn’t mean that things are easy now,” said Nicola as he reflected on Salernitana’s resurgence at the other end of the table. “This is when the difficult bit starts.” Lazio 1-2 Milan, Genoa 1-0 Cagliari, Bologna 2-2 Udinese, Empoli 3-2 Napoli, Salernitana 2-1 Fiorentina, Verona 1-1 Sampdoria, Inter 3-1 Roma, Torino 2-1 Spezia, Venezia 1-3 Atalanta Monday Sassuolo v Juventus  ",Sport/Football,"After Napoli’s latest slip, Serie A's race is between Inter and Milan | Nicky Bandini",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/25/after-napolis-latest-slip-serie-as-race-will-come-down-to-inter-or-milan
4/25/2022,"When Emmanuel Macron’s face appeared on TV at 8pm last night, my friends and I breathed a sigh of relief. With Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (formerly National Front), the far right had come perilously close to gaining power in France, and after two weeks of constant worry about what that would mean for our country’s minorities and institutions, disaster was averted. The same scene was repeating all around France, as we received texts reading “Ouf!” (“Phew !”). It’s an “Ouf!” French voters know too well by now: we already shared it five years ago, when Macron and Le Pen faced each other in the runoff of the 2017 presidential election and he won by 66% of the vote to 34%. But this time, he only defeated her by 58.5% to 41.5%, and the feeling of deja vu quickly gave way to indignation. In April 2002, when Marine Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie, stunned France by going to the runoff against Jacques Chirac, the National Front was defeated 18% to 82%. The margin for comfort has all but evaporated in two decades. How much can we relax when the far right comes closer to reaching the Elysée at every election? It turns out you can relax quite a bit if you are one of Macron’s ministers. Shortly after the announcement, ministers Barbara Pompili and Joël Giraud were filmed dancing to One More Time by Daft Punk on Paris’s Champ de Mars, where Macron’s supporters rallied by the Eiffel Tower to celebrate their victory. The scene was viewed as tone-deaf by many, among them the Green party chief, Julien Bayou, who deemed it “indecent” to party as the “country is fractured”, and compared the DJ at Macron’s celebration to “the orchestra on the sinking Titanic”. Le Monde newspaper described “a soiree without triumph” due to the “historic result” of the far right and France 24 described Macron’s win as a “Pyrrhic victory”, meaning he won at the price of losses so great that it’s almost equal to a defeat. Macron himself was more reserved than his ministers. In contrast to his 2017 win, when he appeared alone, he chose to be accompanied to the stage by his wife, Brigitte, and a dozen children and teenagers, as a way to embody the future and his new mantra, “Nous tous” (“All of us”). On stage, he hailed “the start of a new era”, promised that it will “not be a continuation of this ending five-year-term” and said that he would turn France into “a great green nation”. “To all those who voted for me, not in support of my ideas but to block the far right from winning, your vote obligates me,” he declared. “Tonight, I am no longer the candidate of one side, but the president of all.” Indeed, of all who voted for Macron, 42% did so first and foremost to block the far right. With the record levels of abstention (28%) and the growing far-right vote, this signals a divided France that can only agree on one thing: Macron might have been the lesser of two evils, but he was not reelected for his ideas. On the French left, especially, many found it hard, if not insurmountable to vote for Macron again. For many leftwingers, voting for Macron, the financial banker turned centrist candidate who pledged to transform France into a “startup nation”, was distasteful enough in 2017. Voting for him again, after five years as a president who has favoured the rich, violently repressed protesters, remained apparently unmoved by climate emergency calls and sat and watched, if not helped, as the far right rose into the mainstream, was painful. Cynics joked that in order to stop the far right, they were kissing more of their social rights goodbye. Macron has been reelected, but he is still seen as contemptuous and known to give grand speeches about governing for all, before doing the opposite. Just this morning, the economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, said that there would be “no guarantee” that the new government would refrain from using a constitutional tool known as “article 49.3” to forcefully pass its widely hated pensions system reform, which would delay the legal retirement age to 65 (it’s currently 62). With distrust of Macron running so rampant that many preferred to abstain and risk far-right rule, it’s perhaps no surprise that less than two hours after his re-election, demonstrators massed in Paris’s Place de la République to demand Macron’s resignation. “Macron, clear off!” they chanted. (Police brutally contained them.) “For sure, the coming years won’t be quiet,” Macron admitted last night. The left is already plotting to block his reforms by forming a majority in parliament, as the French will be back to the polls for parliamentary elections on 12 and 19 June. In practice, if Macron’s party doesn’t control a majority in the next National Assembly, the president will have to pick a prime minister representing the parliamentary forces or risk a government that will be challenged by the House at every turn. “The third round starts tonight,” Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who does not hide his hopes to become such a prime minister, said last night. In 2017, Macron was afforded the benefit of the doubt by voters who faced no choice but to back him to fight off Le Pen. This time around, he has six weeks to reverse five years of climate inaction and disdain towards the youth if he hopes to be true to his word. This time around, everyone knows the president has no clothes. Soon, he may also have no parliamentary majority. Pauline Bock is a French journalist based in Paris.

4/25/2022,"We’ve all been known to freeze on being handed the aux cord and told to play a song, any song. The crowd is expectant, the floor is yours: get it right, and it will be the ultimate mic drop, the perfect exit music. Choose wrong and, well – it’s your funeral. In some ways, death occasions your defining DJ set, the ultimate exit music: choosing a song to go out to. At 31 years old, without dependents or assets, the only thought I’ve given to my passing is the question of what music I want played at the funeral – and I have given long and careful consideration. I started curating my playlist in 2018, the year that I became eligible for the so-called 27 Club, after reporting on the trend for non-traditional, highly personalised sendoffs. The thought of forcing my bereft family to sift through my teenage CDs and Spotify account was too much to bear – not least because, addled by grief, they would inevitably get it wrong. I imagined them reaching for the first cassingle I ever bought, Viva La Radio by Lolly, in tearful consensus: “How she loved to hear this.” Relative to settling other affairs before one’s demise, music choice is easy to do, even fun. And yet it seems that I am in the minority in having given the subject any thought, even among people who take soundtracking life seriously. I’ve asked many celebrities what song they’d want at their funeral for the Guardian Saturday magazine’s Honest Playlist interview series, including many musicians. Most of them scramble for an answer, usually ending up with something ludicrously silly (SexyBack, Shaggy, Jesus Christ Superstar with a full musical cast, 15 hours of opera) or highly literal. “They can play what they like,” said Ricky Wilson, “I’ll be dead.” And they’ve been given the questions in advance. It’s your party, and they’ll cry if you want them to. But it’s telling of our discomfort with the fact of our own demise, even when viewed through the relatively superficial prism of music preference. A new survey by insurers SunLife found that only a quarter of people tasked with organising a funeral knew their late loved one’s preference for music or readings – leaving the majority in the unenviable position of having to guess what they wanted to hear. The pressure must be immense. Do you opt for their favourite song of all time? One that captures a particular moment in their life, or their approach to all of it? What if the best, most honest answer to all three is from Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) or Katy Perry’s Teenage Dream? Even the context offers less of a steer than has historically been the case, with funerals increasingly secular and even celebratory. According to SunLife’s survey, only four of the Top 10 songs played at funerals last year were hymns. But when anything goes the choice becomes definitive, and overwhelming. It is no wonder that the bereaved, in the absence of direction, tend to find themselves riffling through the same old sad songbook. Setting aside the hymns, the most popular song played at funerals last year was Frank Sinatra’s My Way, closely followed by Bocelli and Brightman’s Time to Say Goodbye. You’ll Never Walk Alone by Gerry and the Pacemakers, Eva Cassidy’s Over the Rainbow and Bette Midler’s Wind Beneath My Wings also featured. The consistency of these lists, across years and different providers, speaks to the select and conspicuously sad catalogue of songs considered funeral-appropriate. But what’s most striking about this new survey is the gulf between what gets played and what people would actually want for their own sendoff – the likes of Angels, Wonderwall and Don’t Look Back in Anger: anthemic, conquering pop songs for many associated with collective euphoria – football matches, car rides, end-of-evening singalongs. My guess is it’s those moments that, on departing this life, we’d want to remember and be remembered by, not the maudlin or self-aggrandising songs, that have emerged as sendoff standards. My Way, for instance – found to be played at one in every 65 funerals in the UK – expresses a supreme confidence in our life’s course that surely few of us can honestly claim. In fact its popularity is somewhat perverse when – as St Vincent’s Annie Clark pointed out to me, in an interview for a forthcoming Honest Playlist – its message is unrepentant: “It’s not really the way you wanna go out, is it?” But it’s no surprise that when confronted with life’s greatest unknown, we reach for the obvious and even the trite. The sole overlap between SunLife’s lists of the songs we want at our own funerals and those that get played was Monty Python’s Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. It speaks to an especially British self-effacement – an aversion to centring ourselves even at our own sendoff; a reluctance to be seen as wringing undue emotion from, quite literally, a question of life-and-death. In my own surveys of friends (I am cool and fun to hang out with), many opted for jokes: Over and Over by Hot Chip or the Monster Mash. But the overwhelming impression, reading across these lists of final requests, is of uncertainty with the brief: in a secular society, where (as an academic told me in 2018) “people define themselves by the products they consume, the experiences they can craft” – what should a funeral be? SunLife has even attempted to inspire with an online generator of “music to go out to”, suggesting a swansong from inputs such as your age, favourite flower and desired funereal vibe. My wish to be remembered as “fun-loving” threw up Someone You Loved, by Lewis Capaldi. It is a sobering reminder: when we fail to make our last requests known, we leave someone else to play DJ, and they might put on Lewis Capaldi. It’s important, I think, that we confront our inevitable fates even in this small way – that we tell each other how we would like to be farewelled and remembered, if only so we can understand each other better now. I’ve learned a lot about my friends and family and their approach to life by talking about (admittedly after some pressing) what they’d want played at its end. One friend, with whom I’ve always connected over music, borrowed a song from my funeral playlist for his: the ultimate endorsement. My sister, meanwhile, surprised me by floating for herself New York State of Mind, despite having never been to New York. She has likewise been directed to my Spotify playlist marked with a skull emoji: an hour-long, carefully sequenced set of songs of personal or thematic significance – plus a few bangers to get the crowd going. Do it your way, I say. Or you’ll end up with My Way.",Arts/Music,It’s your party and they’ll cry if you want them to: the lost art of picking funeral songs,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/25/its-your-party-and-theyll-cry-if-you-want-them-to-the-lost-art-of-picking-funeral-songs
4/25/2022,"George Russell has said he suffered back and chest pain during the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix as a result of the “porpoising” problem disproportionately affecting Mercedes and warned drivers across the grid could not keep going until the end of the season if the issue persisted. Russell managed to finish fourth at Imola having started 11th but his Mercedes team-mate, Lewis Hamilton, suffered a frustrating and fruitless race in 13th, and the ingnominy of being lapped by race winner Max Verstappen, leaving team principal Toto Wolff to describe Hamilton’s car in particular as “undriveable”. The Mercedes is still suffering from the porpoising – the violent bouncing on the straight caused by the ground-effect aero unloading and loading – that has stymied their car’s performance all season. At Imola it was particularly severe. In order to mitigate it, Mercedes have to compromise their set up, which affects tyre grip and downforce and has knock-on issues across the car. “The bouncing, it really takes your breath away. It’s the most extreme I’ve ever felt it,” Russell said. “I really hope we find a solution and I hope every team struggling with the bouncing finds a solution, because it’s not sustainable for the drivers to continue. This is the first weekend I’ve truly been struggling with my back, and almost like chest pains from the severity of the bouncing.” Verstappen won with a commanding drive from pole position and with teammate Sergio Pérez sealed Red Bull’s first one-two finish since Malaysia in 2016. With Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc making an unforced error late in the race and spinning off, he could manage only sixth and Verstappen was able to close the championship gap to Leclerc to just 27 points from the 46 it had been at the start of the weekend. Russell, meanwhile, benefitted from three cars going off at turn one on the opening lap, moving up to sixth. He later passed Haas’s Kevin Magnussen with a good move on track and ultimately finished in fourth. Behind him Hamilton suffered his worst weekend of the season. Wolff, however, has insisted that Hamilton would be swiftly back to his combative self, seeking to make the difference with the team and emerge stronger than ever. “The guy is the best driver in the world and he is not having a machine and equipment underneath him to be able to execute,” Wolff said. “In a way its irrelevant whether you come in eighth, or 12th or 15th, it doesn’t matter – it’s all bad. But the real stars they recover, there is none of the truly great ones that didn’t have certain moments in their careers where things didn’t run properly. That is the case now with him and he is going to help the team sort it out. We will stick together through good and bad days and Sunday was certainly a very bad day.” Without scoring a point at Imola Hamilton is now 58 points behind championship leader Leclerc. The seven-time champion admitted this weekend that his hopes of competing for the title this season were already over, with only six races gone. He was disappointed with his race on Sunday but said he had endured lower moments in his career. However he did concede that given the team’s current woes he was not looking forward to the next round, F1’s much-hyped debut in Miami.",Sport/Sport,F1: George Russell complains of ‘porpoising’ pain in Mercedes at Imola,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/25/f1-george-russell-complains-of-porpoising-pain-mercedes-imola-emilia-romagna-grand-prix
4/25/2022,"Chocolate and vanilla – both from Mexico, both delicious. One is haunting, fleeting in nature, the other bold, assertive and multifaceted with its many flavour profiles. I find it wondrous that these two ingredients are among the most coveted in the world. Buy a bottle of good tequila and marvel at how it complements the chocolate in my molten chocolate and ancho cake. Then, a recipe remembering the sweetest of Mexican pineapples I have tasted, here baked in a tarte tatin. For the sweet-toothed, this is an exuberant romp through a world of Mexican-inspired sweet treats. This deliriously gooey chocolate cake was inspired by a pudding I tried in Mexico City, steeped with the sweet notes of ancho chilli. The twice-baked method is one from St.John restaurant, recently given a renaissance by the wonderful pastry chef Ravneet Gill – it is foolproof and ensures a squidgy molten core. Prep 15 minCook 1 hrServes 8–10 240g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing7 eggs, separated260g caster sugar80g blanched hazelnuts240g dark chocolate1 ancho chilli, stem and seeds discarded, or 10g ancho flakes, soaked in boiling hot water2 tbsp blanco or reposado tequila1 tsp vanilla extract25g cocoa powder¼ tsp ground cinnamonA large pinch of salt Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 and grease a 23cm springform cake tin with butter and line with parchment paper. Put the egg yolks in the bowl of a mixer with the sugar and beat for a few minutes, until the yolks have tripled in volume. Empty the nuts on to a baking sheet and toast in the oven for five to 10 minutes, until pale golden. Do put on a timer – there is nothing more irritating than burning nuts! Meanwhile, put the chocolate and butter in a bain-marie over a lowish heat. Drain the chilli, pound to a paste with a pestle and mortar or chopping knife, and add to the chocolate with the tequila and vanilla. Stir a few times until melted – about five to 10 minutes. If the chocolate splits, don’t worry: it will come back when you add the eggs. In a small grinder, blitz the nuts with the cocoa powder, cinnamon and salt and set aside. Beat the egg whites with an electric whisk to soft peaks. Gradually pour the melted chocolate into the yolks, using a stick blender to combine thoroughly. Fold in the nuts, followed by the whites, in three stages. Empty half the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the top. Bake for 20–25 minutes, until risen and a metal skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Rest for 10 minutes. At this stage, you can keep the cake overnight and finish the baking the next day or cool for one hour and carry on. Turn the oven up to 210C (190C fan)/425F/gas 7. Pour the rest of the mixture on to the cake and smooth with a palette knife, leaving a border around the edges. Bake for 12–15 minutes, until a light crust has formed on top. Cool for 10 minutes, then tuck in. This lasts well for up to three days stored at room temperature or in the fridge, where the top becomes mousse-like.

Roll out the pastry to 3mm thick, then cut to the size of your ovenproof frying pan (about 24cm). Put on a floured plate and return to the fridge. Peel the pineapple, cut in half or quarters, and remove the core. Cut into slices 1cm thick. Make the caramel next. Pour the caster sugar into a wide pan and put over a medium heat. Cook for six to nine minutes, occasionally swirling the pan (but not stirring) until the sugar has melted and turns amber. Add the pineapple, butter, vanilla, spices and salt, and simmer for six to eight minutes, basting and turning each slice in the sauce every few minutes. The sugar may clump but it will melt again. Take off the heat and arrange the pineapple slices so they’re overlapping and evenly covering the bottom of the pan. Cover with the puff pastry, tucking it in at the edges, and prick the top all over with a fork. Bake for 20–25 minutes until the pastry is deep golden and crisp. While the tart is in the oven, transfer the cream, sugar and rum to a large bowl and whip until you have soft peaks. Chill until you’re ready to serve. Leave the tart to cool for five minutes, then invert on to a serving dish and sprinkle with lime zest. Serve with the rum cream.

4/25/2022,"Some silly cliches and tiresomely obvious liberal-balance contrivances have been pumped into this action-thriller for Netflix from South African director Mandla Dube, which is inspired by one of the most sensational events in anti-apartheid history: the Silverton siege in 1980. Three armed activists of the ANC’s uMkhonto we Sizwe (“spear of the nation”) wing – Humphrey Makhubo, Fanie Mafoko, and Wilfred Madela – occupied a bank in Silverton, Pretoria, after the chaotic abandonment of another operation to sabotage an oil plant, taking 25 people hostage and demanded the release of Nelson Mandela. Meanwhile armed officers grimly surrounded the building. The movie version turns these three men into two men and a woman, with different fictional names: Calvin (Thabo Rametsi), Aldo (Stefan Erasmus) and Terra (Noxolo Dlamini). In accordance with time-honoured Hollywood practice, the film invents a “good” white cop: Captain Langerman (Arnold Vosloo), a careworn, fair-minded guy who comes to respect the hostage-takers’ idealism. There is also a “bad” white cop, the fascistic brigadier (Justin Strydom), known as “Little Crocodile” in homage to South Africa’s “Big Crocodile” prime minister: apartheid strongman PW Botha. The brigadier of course overrules Langerman’s softer approach. The movie imagines that there is a police informer inside the ANC group (I wonder what the present-day ANC think about this touch) and it also fictionalises a deeply unlikely government minister’s daughter who actually works at the bank in an assistant-managerial position, and whose liberal views come out in a full-blown and somewhat bizarre Patty Hearst episode. And just in case there aren’t enough stock situations, we get a bit of Butch-and-Sundance defiance as well. It’s pretty routine stuff, and disappointing.

4/25/2022,"So many people have told me that the line “This is the day your life will surely change” has soundtracked a particular turning point in their life, which is what I was hoping for when I wrote it. This Is the Day is autobiographical, but I wanted to write something simultaneously personal and universal. I was 21 and going through various life changes. I was in a new relationship, with Fiona, my first proper girlfriend. I’d come off the dole, signed to CBS and had been recording in New York, which all felt very exciting. My ex-manager and I ended up smashing up hotel rooms and misbehaving, all the stuff you feel you’re supposed to do when you’re 21 and signed to a record company and abroad. Drugs were involved, of course. The record company had loved Uncertain Smile so I was under a lot of pressure to come up with another single. I wrote This Is the Day on an Omnichord at Fiona’s council flat. I remember crying as I was writing it. I was very young, but writing from an older point of view, thinking about “reading some old letters”, “memories that hold your life together, like glue” and family members. It’s looking back and forward – melancholy but with a hope that things are going to change for the better. The opening line “Well you didn’t wake up this morning ’cause you didn’t go to bed / You were watching the whites of your eyes turn red” describes how I was living. Other images came from different parts of my life. I remembered being in a classroom, bored at school, and looking at a “plane flying across a clear blue sky”. The aircraft was a symbol of hope, aspiration, travel and the future and what I wanted to do with my life. During writing and recording, it felt like a very strong song. Co-producer Paul Hardiman was a brilliant collaborator and the whole Soul Mining album used interesting instrumentation – we had marimbas and cellos alongside guitars and synthesisers. The song means more to me now, in a way. I’ve lost my two brothers, my mum and on the last tour, my dad died just days before we played London. Singing it feels very emotional. When it first came out in 1983 it went in the chart at No 71 or something but it’s become my most successful song. I get continual requests for its use in films, television dramas, documentaries, all sorts. If you could concertina all the plays it’s had over the years into a couple of weeks it would probably be a No 1. I was working as a session musician and used to go to the Garden studios in London (owned by John Foxx from Ultravox) to play keyboards, programme drum machines and such. Matt was recording there. Playing accordion was quite unusual then, so I was asked to do a session. In the studio there was just me, Matt and Paul, the producer. Nowadays you’re sent all the music beforehand, but back then you’d just go to the studio, they’d play the song for you and then you would just play along. If you needed another run through you’d do a second take, or maybe have a go at a solo. For This Is the Day the main hook had already been mapped out on a fiddle, but otherwise it was just a case of hit record and let’s go. I think they had only decided they wanted an accordion at the very last minute. At the time, it was just another of the many sessions I was cramming in, having not earned any money playing for years. We did the video on a pier somewhere – Brighton, I think – and it was February and freezing. Not accordion-playing weather. It was obvious why the song was a single, but you never know that something is going to become successful or that one day you’ll hear it all over the world. In the US someone did a soundalike version to avoid paying royalties. I heard it in a supermarket and thought “Oh, that’s me”, then listened more closely and thought, “Oh no it isn’t!”",Arts/Music,‘It means more to me now I’ve lost family’: how the The made This Is the Day,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/25/how-the-the-made-this-is-the-day
4/25/2022,"Six million people are on the waiting list for NHS hospital care, with operations in England being cancelled across England due to Covid causing “major disruption,” according to the country’s top surgeon. This comes as the Office for National Statistics released figures showing more than seven in 10 people in England have been infected with Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic.

4/25/2022,"Large fires broke out early on Monday at two oil depots in the Russian city of Bryansk, less than 100 miles from the border with Ukraine, in a potential act of sabotage by Kyiv. Russian state media said the first fire occurred at a civilian facility in Bryansk holding 10,000 tons of fuel, followed by a second fire at a military fuel depot holding 5,000 tons. Bryansk, which is less than 100 miles north-east of the Ukrainian border, serves as a logistics base for Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine. Images posted on Russian social media showed columns of smoke rising from the facilities in the Russian city on Monday morning. Military analyst Rob Lee said that the footage suggested the fire was “probably” caused by Ukrainian sabotage. “It sounds like something is flying through the air before the explosion. I think it was probably a Ukrainian attack, but we cannot be certain,” Lee said. “The fact that it was two separate sites not far from the border is important,” Lee said, adding that the fires may have been caused by a Tochka-U tactical ballistic missile, which he said had the range to reach both targets if deployed near the Russian-Ukrainian border. Lee added that if Ukrainian involvement was confirmed, the strikes were likely to have been conducted to “disrupt fuel supplies for the Russian military”. In a statement on its website, the Russian emergency ministry only mentioned one of the fires, saying that a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 2am local time caught fire and there had been no need to evacuate any parts of the city of 400,000 people. Russia’s investigative committee said in a separate statement that it had ordered an investigation into the incident. Ukrainian officials have so far not commented on the fire. Several videos posted on social media on Monday morning appeared to show the moment of the explosion at one of the oil depots in Bryansk. According to Baza, a Telegram news channel with links to Russian security services, the fires were caused by Ukrainian drones. Russia has repeatedly accused Ukrainian of launching strikes on its territory. Last week, Moscow blamed Ukrainian helicopters for hitting residential buildings and injuring seven people in Bryansk. At the beginning of April, the governor of the Belgorod region, which is also close to the Ukraine border, said that two Kyiv helicopters had fired at a fuel depot there, claims Ukraine has denied. The Russian defence ministry has promised to bomb targets in Kyiv in response to what it said were “terrorist and sabotage” attacks on its territory carried out by Ukraine’s “nationalist regime”. Russia has suffered a series of major fires at state facilities across the country in recent weeks. On Friday, 17 people were killed after a huge fire broke out at a key Russian defence research institute in Tver, north-west of Moscow. On the same day, a major chemical plant not far from Moscow caught fire. Russia, where accidental fires are common due to dilapidated infrastructure, has blamed the fire in Tver on ageing wiring.",News/World news,Large fires break out at Russian oil depots,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/large-fires-break-out-russian-oil-depots-bryansk-near-ukraine-border
4/25/2022,"We are one year on from the Football Assocation transferring responsibility for Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship match officials to the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL). There is still no timeframe for the full professionalisation of referees operating in the top two tiers of the women’s game, despite a clamouring for improvement, but the passionate and pioneering referee Bibiana Steinhaus-Webb is leading the push. Having begun refereeing in the Frauen Bundesliga in 1999, the 43-year-old German became the first woman to referee in the men’s Bundesliga in the 2017-18 season. Now she oversees officiating in England. She says: “The English competition is one of the strongest in the world and it definitely attracted me to this job as well as Kelly Simmons [the FA’s head of the women’s professional game] and Mike Riley [general manager of the PGMOL], who have been very convincing about the structures and investment they are willing to put in place and the future picture that they shared with me. “If that had not happened, I probably would have stayed somewhere else. So, it’s not only the dedication that they have shown, it’s the willingness for change which attracted me.” Change is needed. With games now broadcast across BBC Sport, Sky Sports and the FA Player, refereeing in the women’s game is under increased scrutiny. The game is growing but the development of officiating has not kept pace. “The game has developed so much in recent years,” Steinhaus-Webb says. “I’m not surprised by where it is and I’m not surprised by the coverage and the content because it’s exciting, it’s thrilling.”. “But I think we have invested so much in the players, in the coaches, in the venues, and referees have not really been a topic. So, it feels unfair for me to expect the referees to be at the same speed as the game. We have to get there, but you need the support and a bit of time to keep up with it.” Steinhaus-Webb describes placing referees for the women’s game under the wing of the PGMOL as “a first huge step towards professionalising the workforce in the women’s game” and that “the human resources [needed] to look after professional athletes is something totally different”. Referees working in women’s football now have access to the same support structure as those working in the men’s game. “The support structure around referees is crucial,” Steinhaus-Webb adds. “There’s so many different layers needed to make sure a referee is the best they can come three o’clock.” This includes a fitness team, psychological support, individual referee coaches, technical support and access to many hours of footage from across the men’s and women’s pyramids. The psychological element is increasingly important. “We had a situation at Manchester City vs Arsenal when the referee was hit by the ball, and a few seconds after City scored,” Steinhaus-Webb says. “Abi Byrne was the referee … we spoke about this incident for days and days, weeks and weeks. Abi is an international referee with a really strong mentality and a huge amount of experience. “From a technical point of view she did everything correctly, she got hit by the ball, the ball stayed within the same team, within their own penalty area almost, so that’s not a promising attack and she let play continue. But then, in the way the game developed, they scored at the other end a few seconds after. “From now on, expect every referee to blow the whistle. Going through this, the scrutiny, was the first time she really realised how much exposure the game actually has. [We must] take care of our people. They are human beings, and we have to make sure that they are in a mental state to be ready to take 300 decisions, approximately, in every single game.” For referees operating in the women’s game it can be tough to find the time to slot all this varying support around their work schedules and “buying more and more time of the referees” to enable them to be in the best place to take full advantage is the next step. Steinhaus-Webb says: “Some of the officials are on contract already so it’s really about how much we can increase these contracts and how much we can see that others will join them. It’s a personal decision as well. Where are you in your journey? Are you a youngster of 20-ish years looking for a full-time professional career in football or are you in the autumn of your career where you have to balance things in a different way? This is a very individual question to answer.” Sign up for our free women’s newsletter! Is there a risk though that with the professionalism of players pushing the game forward refereeing will require accelerated growth to keep pace? “We all want to develop the game in the best way possible and there is a certain amount of money in the game, and you have to prioritise where you want to put it and what you do first. Now, referees are a big part of it. “Yes, the game has developed massively and the whole group of referees might not be at the top level yet, but what we have is a number of referees who can easily catch up with the game and are at an even higher level. The questions are: how do we support the whole group of people, the whole group of officials to get up there as well?”",Sport/Football,Pioneering referee aims to keep officials up with women’s game’s rise ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/25/pioneering-referee-bibiana-steinhaus-webb-aims-to-keep-officials-up-with-womens-game-rise-england
