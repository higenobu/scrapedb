12/13/2021,"Mired in sluggish Premier League form, reeling from the disappointment of Thursday’s Europa League exit at Napoli and with their squad buffeted by Covid positives and general illness, Leicester needed something to lift them. How James Maddison provided it. The playmaker had already won the 38th minute penalty from which Youri Tielemans gave his team the lead – a little dubiously, it should be said – when he made a pre-assist of such quality that it not only shredded Newcastle’s backline but broke the collective spirit of Eddie Howe’s visitors.  Addressing a short pass from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in the inside-left channel, midway up the Newcastle half, Maddison had already seen the run of Harvey Barnes and made the calculations. With the outside of his right boot, he sculpted a first-time ball that set his teammate racing clear. Barnes squared to Patson Daka, in for the rested Jamie Vardy, and he did the rest. Maddison was not finished. Not by a long shot. He took a low cross from Daka after Luke Thomas had won the ball high up before ushering in Tielemans for 3-0 and there was still time for him to get himself on the scoresheet. The Newcastle support refused to be cowed into silence but their team was broken and it was too easy for Leicester – the substitute, Marc Albrighton, winning the ball off Joelinton and finding Maddison, who swapped passes with Daka, ran around Fabian Schär and shot into the far corner. For Brendan Rodgers, there was the bonus of a first clean sheet in the league since the opening weekend of the season and, for him and his team, it felt like a trick of the mind that they had laboured for much of the first half. Maddison would depart to a standing ovation when substituted on 88 minutes, plus a bear hug from Rodgers. Newcastle had won their first game of the league season last weekend – at home to Burnley – and this had felt like a big chance for them, before games against Liverpool and the Manchester clubs. They failed to take it, flattering to deceive up front despite the best efforts of Allan Saint-Maximin before capitulating in alarming fashion. At the start of play, only three clubs had conceded more league goals than Leicester this season, one of them being Newcastle, and it had felt like being a battle of the dodgy defences. Initially, it was Newcastle who asked the questions and it was certainly not a part of Rodgers’s script to lose Jonny Evans to a muscle strain in the sixth minute. The manager was forced to drop the defensive midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, back as a makeshift centre-half. Leicester were nervous at the outset. They gave the ball away cheaply on several occasions and they invited Newcastle to settle. Where was the pressure on the ball? It was easy to hear the knock of opportunity for the visitors and, equally, to wonder whether they had the personnel in the final third to take advantage. Miguel Almirón shot into the side-netting while Evans lay stricken and Callum Wilson fired across goal after robbing Ndidi. The ball flashed off Calgar Soyuncu’s head and went past the far post. From the corner, Thomas was forced to throw himself into a block to deny Schär and, midway through the first half, Saint-Maximin picked up a stray pass from the substitute, Boubakary Soumaré, and saw his shot blocked. Nothing clearcut but it felt promising for Newcastle. It would be all downhill for them from there. Leicester measured their first-half threat in set pieces. Maddison curled a free-kick just over while Ndidi’s header from another Maddison free-kick, awarded after a burst by Daka, extended Martin Dubravka. The effort did look to be going just past the far post. The turning point followed a clumsy attempt by Newcastle to play out from the back, Jonjo Shelvey – put into trouble by Jamaal Lascelles – taking a heavy touch and Tielemans nicking the ball towards Maddison, who was too quick for Lascelles. The penalty award felt soft in real time, Lascelles lunging in but quickly checking out of the challenge; Maddison looking for the contact, feeling it and going down. The impression was only confirmed by the replays. If the referee, Peter Bankes, had not made the decision, it seemed unlikely that VAR would have intervened. On the other hand, it was one of those that was never going to be overruled by the technology. Tielemans’s conversion was high and unstoppable. Newcastle’s best bet was Saint-Maximin, who has that priceless ability with his dancing feet to make things happen in tight spaces. But it was Maddison who made the difference just before the hour, his pass that carved open Newcastle a thing of wonder. Barnes drew Dubravka nicely and Daka’s somersaulting celebration was as extravagant as the tap-in was simple. Newcastle’s only second-half moment came when Timothy Castagne erred with a back pass, failing to spot that Kasper Schmeichel was away from his goal. Schmeichel tore back to slide and scrape off his line with the outside of his boot. It was merely the prompt for Leicester to turn the screw.",Sport/Football,James Maddison leads way as Leicester demolish Newcastle United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/12/leicester-newcastle-premier-league-match-report
12/13/2021,"First there was the party at the Oslo restaurant which resulted in 80 out of 111 guests catching Covid, mostly the Omicron variant, despite being doubly vaccinated and having tested negative before attending. Then came the seven German tourists who all travelled together to South Africa and caught Omicron, despite having received a booster. Over the last few days, anecdotal reports suggested an increasing number of Omicron outbreaks at social gatherings in the UK, too. The broadcaster Victoria Derbyshire tweeted that her brother caught Covid three or four weeks after receiving his booster jab after a night out with “a load of mates” on 3 December. All were vaccinated and 17 out of 21 tested positive, she said.  Although official data has yet to confirm the trend, concerns are mounting about the impact of increased transmissibility, including among fully vaccinated people, even if most are reporting relatively mild symptoms. “Certainly, compared to the Delta variant, we’re seeing more of these multiple infection events,” said Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, who runs the Zoe Covid symptom app. “Delta didn’t seem to affect everyone at an event – just one out of six vaccinated people might get ill then.” Now, it could be a majority. Omicron also seems to come on very quickly “because the transmission time is very short”, said Spector. That’s why he is advising anyone attending a social gathering to do a rapid lateral flow test (LFT) “a few hours before leaving the house”, rather than relying on one from the day before or earlier. On Sunday, the education secretary, Nadim Zahawi, confirmed there were now Omicron cases in UK hospitals and warned that the new strain is “so infectious that it will dominate and exponentially grow”. On Friday the Zoe app launched a survey asking people to share their Omicron experience. Early responses suggest that Omicron seems to be able to evade vaccine protection in some people, as borne out by UKHSA data released the same day. “People are saying: ‘We went to this event and nearly all of us are testing positive, and we’re waiting to find out if this is Omicron,’” said Spector. Many people only learn they have Omicron several days after receiving a positive PCR test. That’s because not all samples are being sequenced for the variant and because only a third of labs in England are capable of telling people immediately if they have it, said Spector. “The problem is that only about a third of the country would know immediately if it’s Omicron or not, and only a sample are being tested. So depending on where you live, the risk of having a PCR test that comes back and immediately says this is probable Omicron is going to vary, and it’s actually lower in the south and London than it is in the north of England,” he said. Most labs don’t yet have the technical capabilities to detect the gene “dropout” associated with Omicron, he explained, adding: “It’s not about whether it [is a] good or bad lab, it’s just what they were set up to do.” One person contacted the Guardian to say they went on a weekend away with four friends and all four later tested positive for Covid. They had received their booster and the other three had been double jabbed. Two days after their PCR results came back, two received a text from NHS England saying: “Following our previous guidance, we have identified that you may have the Omicron variant of Covid-19.” The text instructed them to tell everyone in their household to self-isolate, regardless of their vaccination status or age. The person who had been boosted said: “None of us have been really ill. Me the lightest – the heaviest did a day in bed. No one has been really ill. We have all had worse colds.” One Zoe contributor said 16 out of 18 people at a 60th birthday party in Somerset tested PCR positive for Omicron. All were vaccinated, some with boosters, and had a negative LFT 24 hours beforehand. Their symptoms were all mild, Spector said: sore throats, nausea, slight temperatures and headaches. No one needed a doctor. He said he was advising people to stay at home if they have cold-like symptoms. “Avoid large gatherings and split your groups up into smaller ones where you can control the environment and get everyone to test that day. “Make sure that no one attending that party has cold-like symptoms or hasn’t had cold like symptoms the past three or four days, and on the way to the event make sure that you’re wearing a high quality mask on crowded public transport, which people are not doing.”",News/World news,How Omicron appears to be infecting Britain – despite the vaccine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/how-omicron-appears-to-be-infecting-britain-despite-the-vaccine
12/13/2021,"Well said, Rachel Clarke (Talk of a No 10 Christmas party is an insult to the thousands who have died of Covid, 8 December). Her wholly justifiable anger, based on her frontline experience of caring for her patients, encapsulates, I suspect, the fury and frustrations of many. Once he has completed his investigations into “partygate”, the cabinet secretary might usefully place a copy of Ms Clarke’s article alongside the agenda for future cabinet meetings, if only to remind participants that government is a serious business with serious consequences, ideally conducted by serious professionals rather than the current bunch of self-serving, irresponsible amateurs.Phil MurrayLinlithgow, West Lothian   With the number of the new Omicron cases likely to rise exponentially, and stringent national measures needed, one thing is sure – the rightwing Covid recovery group of Tory MPs will vote against them (Javid advised to take ‘stringent’ Covid measures within a week, leak reveals, 10 December). Their argument will inevitably focus on the impact of such measures as masks in pubs or stricter isolation requirements on the economy, and by voting against the proposals they give yet more encouragement, as if any more was needed after the Downing Street party fiasco, to a UK public keener than ever to disobey. I have yet to hear a counter argument that details what effect a wave of hospitalisations – up to 10,000 a day – would have on the economy (Report, 10 December). As there is very little data on the severity of disease caused by Omicron, the only sensible approach has to be preventative and cautious. Tory backbenchers might be willing to play politics with the lives of the British people, but making a new strain of a deadly virus a political football is downright despicable. The sixth richest economy in the world can easily afford to subsidise hospitality venues in trouble, but it cannot afford risking a variant that evades the population’s built-up immunity running rife.Bernie EvansLiverpool  It’s ironic that just about the only sensible anti-Covid measures our prime minister is contemplating – further controls to combat the spread of the virus – are prompting the biggest rebellion so far among his backbenchers (Report, 9 December).

The key question for voters in North Shropshire is not “Do you want Labour to win?” but “Do you want the Conservatives to lose?” If their answer to that is yes, then it’s in the country’s interest, and in democracy’s interest, to support the Lib Dems in making that happen.

12/13/2021,"UK government proposals to overhaul gambling legislation have been delayed until spring, the Guardian understands, prompting a warning from campaigners that the postponement could lead to more suffering and even suicide. The Conservative party pledged to review gambling laws in its 2019 general election manifesto, in response to mounting concern among politicians, campaigners and civil society groups about the way the £14bn-a-year industry is regulated.  A white paper was initially expected before the end of last year, before being bumped into 2021. Several sources told the Guardian that a second delay is now almost inevitable, meaning government is now unlikely to publish its proposals until after a separate decision, due in February 2022, on who will win the next 10-year licence to run the National Lottery. Liz Ritchie co-founded the charity Gambling With Lives with husband Charles after their son Jack took his own life, having become addicted to gambling at school. She pointed to research suggesting strong links between gambling and suicide. “Everyday at least one person takes their life because of gambling,” she said, as the group launched a campaign demanding that a regulatory investigation into every case of suicide where gambling is a factor. “Every delay means more families shattered,” said Ritchie. “When will the government act?” Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party group examining gambling-related harm, said the review process had “gone on for long enough”. “The government made a commitment to reform our gambling laws in 2019. Two years later they are still deliberating while the online industry is weakly regulated, reaps vast profits and people continue to be harmed.” The delay is partly down to a ministerial reshuffle that involved John Whittingdale, who was widely perceived as friendly towards the gambling industry, making way for Chris Philp. Speaking at an event last week, Philp said the white paper would be published “in the coming months”. He indicated that he was considering a tough crackdown, including strict affordability checks to prevent addicts and vulnerable people falling into financial ruin. Philp is thought to have got to grips with his new brief quickly but the change of personnel within the department of culture, media and sport (DCMS) is among the reasons for the delay. The key factor is the ongoing competition to win a 10-year licence to operate the National Lottery, with Camelot facing stiff competition that could cost it the monopoly it has held since the lottery’s inception in 1994. The Gambling Commission, which regulates both the lottery and the wider gambling industry, is running the lottery licence competition and is due to announce its decision in February, after extending the process for six months. A source familiar with the situation said that the National Lottery decision was likely to be announced first, clearing the way for the gambling white paper after that. The DCMS declined to comment.",News/Society,Campaigners condemn latest UK move to delay overhaul of gambling laws,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/12/campaigners-condemn-latest-uk-move-to-delay-overhaul-of-gambling-laws
12/13/2021,"Despite Barcelona’s fall from grace, this will probably not be enough to induce feelings of panic at the Camp Nou. West Ham supporters, anticipating the prospect of a prize scalp in the Europa League draw, chorused: “Barcelona, we’re coming for you.” Forget Barcelona, West Ham may rue their inability to beat Burnley. For a side with a genuine chance of a top-four finish, it felt a case of two points dropped. Sean Dyche’s bland team put the stale into the stalemate while David Moyes cut an increasingly frustrated figure, irritated at his side’s inability to forge a breakthrough. West Ham have flagship wins over Liverpool and Chelsea but a failure to beat Brentford, Brighton and now Burnley threatens to prove more telling for a club of their lofty aspirations.  Under other circumstances, a first top-flight clean sheet at Turf Moor since 1928 might have felt more of an achievement for a team burdened by defensive injuries, especially as Lukasz Fabianski only had to field one, tame attempt on target. If a couple of terrific saves by Nick Pope and some defiant defending secured Burnley’s shutout, in itself a rarity for them this season, West Ham offered too little excitement. It was as though their reserves of inspiration were exhausted against Chelsea last week. Declan Rice felt the lone exception. A player on a different level to most of his teammates and all of his opponents made a series of driving runs and threatened a winner with a spectacular late shot. The watching Steven Gerrard may have recognised the sight of a midfielder capable of grabbing a game by the scruff of its neck. Another spectator was given much to consider. Gareth Southgate has omitted Pope from recent squads, but the goalkeeper reacted brilliantly to keep out Issa Diop’s header, courtesy of Jarrod Bowen’s free kick. If that showed the speed of his reactions, Pope illustrated his athleticism by parrying Saïd Benrahma’s header. Include an injury-time save from Bowen and a painful occasion for him, when he was bloodied by Craig Dawson’s boot, was a triumphant one. But West Ham occupied Pope too rarely. Fresh from his freakish winner against Chelsea, Arthur Masuaku almost scored in more deliberate fashion, connecting sweetly with a volley that went just wide. In the second half, Benrahma and Michail Antonio fired wide from distance and the latter has now gone eight games without a goal. Goal droughts are more common among the Burnley players, however. They were poor in possession, lacking fluency or creativity. Relying on Maxwel Cornet to score wonder goals rarely felt a sustainable formula, even before injury ruled him out. With Dyche fielding a midfield who lack a goal between them this season, there was an added importance to defenders’ efforts from set-pieces. James Tarkowski leapt highest to meet Dwight McNeil’s corner but headed over. Meanwhile, Jay Rodriguez looped a header wide and had a half-volley deflected wide by Dawson, but the striker has a solitary goal in his last 46 league games. Dawson was at the heart of the lone flashpoint. Burnley were reprieved when McNeil tripped Dawson in the box. Referee Graham Scott did not award the penalty; the greater surprise was that Jonathan Moss, the VAR, did not either. Perhaps he concluded that Dawson sought the contact; perhaps he simply deemed that officiating Manchester City versus Wolves gave him enough experience of awarding contentious penalties for one weekend.",Sport/Football,Nick Pope keeps West Ham at bay to earn point for Burnley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/12/burnley-west-ham-premier-league-match-report
12/13/2021,"Britain’s most senior police leaders are considering making a public admission that their forces are institutionally racist, the Guardian has learned. High-level discussions began on Thursday and come as their special adviser on race says the declaration is needed if promises of radical reform are to be believed by black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. More discussions will be held in January with a decision from police chiefs expected in February.  Policing has been engulfed in a race crisis with a series of controversies over stop and search and use of force, leaving black people’s confidence lower than white people’s. Police chiefs have admitted this damages their legitimacy and ability to fight crime. The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) appointed the barrister Abimbola Johnson to chair an independent board to scrutinise a promised suite of reforms. A new plan to make policing anti-racist is promised and Johnson said that institutional racism had to be admitted: “The plan needs to accept institutional racism, if it is to be anti-racist … If the idea is to win the trust of black communities, policing needs to start by acknowledging both the historical and current manifestations of racism in policing.” Policing was first officially labelled as institutionally racist in the 1999 Macpherson report into the failings that let the racist killers of black student Stephen Lawrence escape justice for so long. The ranks of officers are still disproportionately white, with a smaller proportion of ethnic minority officers in policing than in the general population. Last year, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, denied policing was institutionally racist, telling MPs it was “not a label I find helpful”. She added: “I don’t think we’re collectively failing. I don’t think [racism] is a massive systemic problem, I don’t think it’s institutionalised, and more to the point I think we have come such a very, very, very long way.” Johnson said: “Reluctance to admit institutional racism comes from emphasising the comfort of the wrong people over the experience of black people. For this programme to work, it needs the police to have conversations that are uncomfortable for them.” Sir William Macpherson defined institutional racism as: “The collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin. “It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people.” The chiefs of the 43 local forces in England and Wales are split on the issue. Some feel the term labels them all as racist, is an unwarranted insultgiven the big improvements they believe have been made since the 1999 Macpherson report. One senior source at the talks on Thursday said the chiefs were trying to reach an agreement: “Some are worried about sending out a message that nothing has changed since Macpherson.” Another said: “There are polarised views. The discussions were considered and reflective.” Sir Dave Thompson, the NPCC vice-chair, said they would consider whether to accept that the forces they lead were institutionally racist. “We will look at how we use the language of discrimination and racism with chief constables so that we acknowledge the scale of the challenge that we see to communities, while being able to account for the actions we intend to take,” he said. Thompson, the chief constable of the West Midlands force, added: “Policing is not free of bias, discrimination and racism. We accept that this is not simply a case of individuals but also about the policies and practices of policing. “I am very clear there will be institutional racism issues in policing. There will also be systemic racism, structural racism and also racial disparities that are not due to racism in policing because we police an unequal society. “There is a concern, set out in the [government’s] commission on race disparity report that the term institutional racism can be too casually used as an explanatory term for all disparity or discrimination. This is why the application of this term requires careful thought.” Ethnic minority police officers make up 7% of the ranks, compared with 14% of the population. BAME officers twice as likely to be dismissed as their white counterparts. Among the public, black people are more likely to be stopped for drugs but are less likely to use them. Recent official figures showed the equivalent of one-fifth of male ethnic minority youngsters aged 15-19 were stopped in a single year, with black people seven times more likely to be stopped. Andy George, the president of the National Black Police Association, said promises were no longer enough and institutional racism needed to be admitted. “A problem can never be truly tackled if it is not clearly identified and it is unclear how their plan could deliver actions to something policing does not truly believe is real,” he said.The race crisis that has gripped policing led to thousands of people taking to the streets across the UK in support of Black Lives Matter, triggered by the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in the US in May 2020.

12/13/2021,"Manchester United will have felt a little closer to Europe on Sunday but it had nothing to do with their temporary proximity to the Channel. After four Women’s Super League games without a win, Marc Skinner’s side had looked in peril of becoming marooned in mid-table and were desperately in need of this restorative, and thoroughly convincing, victory on the south coast.  Hope Powell’s Brighton had kicked off in third place but only the excellence of Victoria Williams at centre-half and Megan Walsh in goal prevented United, and their Norway international Vilde Bøe Risa in particular, from scoring a hatful of goals. “We should have been three or four up at half-time,” said Skinner, whose team join Brighton on 15 points. “This was a dominant performance which has been coming for a while and I’m proud of everyone. We were much more like the Manchester United team we want to develop; I loved the aggression from us. We showed what we can be - and Risa was magnificent.” Even so, his players made something of a slow-burn start, with Walsh seemingly hell-bent on helping them extend their winless run. Powell’s goalkeeper proved extremely busy, making four first-half saves from Risa alone before Hayley Ladd’s half-volley finally eluded her. Ladd’s goal arrived in first half stoppage time and originated from a well-worked short corner routine, driven low across the box. For once, the otherwise outstanding Williams was confounded by a set piece concluded by Ladd’s first-time connection with Ona Batlle’s pass. Powell’s key defender had excelled, protecting Walsh admirably but she and her teammates were outwitted by a manoeuvre evidently well-rehearsed on the training ground and designed to render their aerial prowess academic. Brighton’s dismay at falling behind after working so hard was only exacerbated by their lack of threat from open play. Powell’s team had barely ventured into United’s box as they struggled to retain possession. It all seemed a reflection of the enduring lack of creativity and improvisational ability which continues to inhibit a supremely well-organised side reliant on dead-ball routines for almost half their WSL goals. Perhaps attempting to rectify this imbalance, Powell replaced Felicity Gibbons with Danielle Carter at half-time but it was Williams who, early in the second period, came closest to scoring for the home side. After advancing to collect the fall-out from a lofted free-kick, she appeared set to force the dropping ball over the line only to be denied by an extremely brave smothering save on the part of Skinner’s England goalkeeper, Mary Earps. At the other end Walsh continued to thwart Risa until the 69th minute when the attacking midfielder volleyed Alessia Russo’s stellar right-wing cross beyond her adversary, with the ball brushing the inside of a post en route into the back of the net. It was the Norwegian’s first WSL goal since joining United last summer but is unlikely to be the last. To their credit, Brighton refused to fold and Earps saved well from Ellie Brazil after Carter – who showed off a few pleasingly inventive touches – undid Skinner’s defence. United though were generally in control and, had she not sent a late shot whizzing wastefully wide, Ella Toone would surely have increased their margin of victory. “It was an important win for us,” said Risa, after collecting the player of the match award. “We needed to win to be closer to the top of the league so I’m glad to have got my first WSL goal. I was a bit afraid it wouldn’t come today as I had a lot of chances, some big ones, so it was a special moment. “It’s been a perfect afternoon. This is how we want to play; it’s just the start for us.”",Sport/Football,Vilde Bøe Risa helps Manchester United end poor WSL run with Brighton win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/12/brighton-manchester-united-wsl-match-report

The scale of Hamilton’s task in defending his world title becomes clear at Monza when Verstappen bullies his way into the lead, from third on the grid with the Briton on pole, at the start of a rain-soaked race in Italy. Verstappen capitalises on his boldness to win the season’s second race. Hamilton later spins off and drops to sixth but has a stroke of fortune when a red flag allows him to repair and regroup – and fights back for a gutsy, potentially crucial second. Another aggressive, high-risk overtaking manoeuvre from Verstappen at the start presents Hamilton with a choice: hold his ground and almost certainly crash out along with his rival, or cede the racing line and live to fight another lap. The Mercedes man opts for the more measured approach, seeing his pole-position advantage disappear within seconds. But Mercedes’s daring two-stop strategy allied to Hamilton’s relentless skill eventually pays off handsomely. He recovers from 21 seconds down to beat Verstappen into second place at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. A significant blow struck by Hamilton at Silverstone, and a day that attitudes harden between the drivers and teams. The pair clash on the first lap and Verstappen is sent careering into the barriers at 180mph after Hamilton tries to force his way down the inside at Copse, touching his adversary’s right rear wheel. Verstappen is taken to hospital for checks while Hamilton makes light of a 10-second penalty to triumph. The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, accuses the Briton of “dirty driving”. Hamilton emerges from a pitstop fractionally ahead of Verstappen and fights for position into a chicane at Monza. Verstappen refuses to yield and in the resulting crash the Dutchman’s car hops into the air and lands on the Mercedes. “That’s what you get when you don’t leave enough space,” Verstappen claims on the radio seconds after the crash. It seems the halo saves Hamilton’s life, and he later expresses disappointment that Verstappen fails to check if he is OK. “It was good fun until now,” says Toto Wolff of Mercedes. The overriding memory of an insanely chaotic grand prix at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit will be the collision on lap 38, Hamilton’s Mercedes clipping the back of Verstappen’s Red Bull. Verstappen is instructed to let Hamilton pass following the pair’s coming-together two laps earlier with Hamilton pushing for the lead. The Dutchman slows dramatically and Hamilton, failing to realise his rival’s intention, cannot avoid a relatively minor collision. “He brake-tested me!” Hamilton yells on team radio, as a furious row breaks out in the pit lane.",Sport/Sport,Hamilton v Verstappen: six key flashpoints in their F1 title battle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/12/hamilton-v-verstappen-f1-title-battle-key-flashpoints
12/13/2021,"Saturday Night Live returns from a short hiatus with A Holiday Message from Dr Anthony Fauci (Kate McKinnon), who relays the latest informing about Covid-19 to the public. He attempts to calm worries about the new Omicron variant – “if you had a vaccine and a booster … unclench” – before, like last year, turning the stage over to “nerds trying their best” from the CDC, who act out common scenarios relating to the pandemic. These include a guy being banished from society for attempting to eat at a restaurant without his vaccination card, a horny, but worried airplane passenger hitting on game flight attendant, and a mall Santa who no longer allows children to sit on his lap because “thanks to the vaccine, my testicles have ballooned in size”.  This is followed by appearances from a series of public disgraces, including “unemployed brothers” Andrew (Pete Davidson) and Chris Cuomo (Andrew Dismukes), Congressional gun nutjobs Lauren Boebert (Chloe Fineman) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (Cecily Strong), and “weirdo with the beardo” Ted Cruz, who gets the last laugh on the recently deceased Bob Dole for having once said “no one likes me”. The season thus far has seen an overall uptick in the quality of the cold opens, most of which is owed to the new cast members being given the spotlight. Unfortunately, this dire offering sees the show returning to several wells that have long run dry. The smug, unfunny Fauci caricature does nothing but serve to remind viewers that McKinnon is still pulling a paycheck from the show, while the recycling of the utterly forgettable CDC playlets sketch from last December points to how lazy the writers can be. Billie Eilish pulls double duty as host and musical guest. Dressed in a massively poofy Christmas dress that makes her look like “Mrs. Claus going to the club,” the 19-year-old singer-songwriter talks about her signature fashion style (“The real reason I wore big, oversized clothes … is because I was actually two kids stacked on top of each other trying to sneak into an R-rated movie”), her childhood dreams of acting, which were dashed by her mother (who she brings out for a pointless cameo), and the difficulties that come with with being famous at a young age (she uses this to get a solid dig in at Colin Jost, showing off his uber-nerdy high school picture). In the first sketch, a married couple (Melissa Villaseñor, Alex Moffat) look over all the Christmas cards they’ve received from family and friends, such as their “super white, super Christian neighbor”, “cousin who’s made pregnancy their entire personality,” “well-off, middle-aged gay couple your wife is friends with…and gross, little old dog you can’t believe is still alive.” Miley Cyrus shows up briefly, playing herself, and her ease at live comedy makes a sharp contrast with Eilish (playing a bitchy high school frenemy), who comes off noticeably stilted. In what is arguably the low point of the season, we follow a smartphone scroll through some of TikTok’s most popular videos of late, which feature would-be self-defense gurus, doofy fit checks and sad thirst traps, various conspiracy theories and idiotic punditry, twerking nurses and more. The actual visual construction on display is impressive, but this nothing more an overlong regurgitation of viral content everyone’s already sick of. That Saturday Night Live thinks merely referencing these TikToks counts as comedy speaks not only to how utterly uninspired the show has become, but how far behind the cultural curve it is. Frankly, it’s pathetic. That said, uninspired is still preferable to irritating, something which is made very clear by the following sketch. Two hopelessly square, white children’s pageant directors (Eilish and Heidi Gardner) attempt to put a hip-hop spin on their nativity pageant, loudly directing their cast to strut, twerk and work a candy cane stripper pole. Eilish throws herself into her performance, but her southern dialect is all over the map. Gardner, meanwhile, is the most annoying she’s ever been. By the 50th time they’re screaming the word “Pimp Walk!” you’ll be begging for the commercial break. Then Eilish is about to sit down with her family for Christmas dinner, when she spies her elderly neighbor across the street spending the holiday (seemingly) alone. The two women start a correspondence through their windows using notepads, which leads to Eilish inviting the woman over. Things take an unsettling turn when the neighbor reveals herself to be a psychotic racist who is currently committing Munchausen by proxy on her grown son (Mikey Day) and is almost certainly responsible for the murder of her late husband. It’s a darkly clever spin on holiday treacle, but, like every sketch preceding it, it drags on well past the point of amusement. On Weekend Update, Michael Che invites Punkie Johnson to the desk. She starts off talking about her family’s holiday rules (the most important being: “the oldest person must always make the potato salad because they have LIVED … they know the secret ingredient isn’t eggs and paprika, it’s pain!”) before pivoting to her own desire to be a mother one day – but only to a gay daughter (“My family motto gonna be: if I’m smashing hoes, then everybody smashing hoes in this house!”). She’s followed by fellow sophomore cast member Dismukes, who shows up wearing tiger stripe face paint for his new animal segment. Things go off the rails immediately when, instead of predicting the outcome of an upcoming football game, his psychic pet octopus Bongo tells him “You will die in seven days”. Dismukes’s devastated, but dignified acceptance of his impending doom is the highlight of the episode. Next, Eilish plays chanteuse Leslie D. She performs a jazzy number called The Night I Met Santa, in which she bungles an attempted flirtation with Kris Kringle by telling him he has nice teeth, doing finger guns, and calling him a virgin. Eilish is at her most natural in song mode, although surprisingly, it’s Kenan Thompson, playing Santa, who gets the biggest applause after hitting an impressive high note. This is followed by a thematically similar pre-filmed segment in which a lonely Kyle Mooney awkwardly attempts to celebrate the holidays with his fellow cast members, only to continually weird them out. He finds some solace in a brief meeting with Eilish, before terrifying her by indulging his violently unhinged fantasies about kidnapping Day. Eilish then appears alongside McKinnon as dead-eyed front desk girls in a commercial for Business Garden Inn & Suites & Hotel Room Inn. It’s a lazy (if accurate) rundown of the common amenities found in faceless, mid-budget hotels, such as “tiny soap in plastic”, “band-aid colored blanket”, “short glass wearing oval hat” and “wet egg”. Eilish and McKinnon make the already interminable sketch drag on even longer by constantly breaking. At least Eilish’s brother Finneas – making his second appearance of the night – acquits himself better during his short walk-on as Trevor, a sleazy “bellhop/valet/night manager/in-house doctor”. The first part of this episode was as bad as the show has been all year, although things slightly improved during the back half. When it comes to live comedy, Eilish is no Miley Cyrus, but at least she balanced things out with two strong musical performances. The writing, on the other hand, was a total bust, with almost every sketch revolving around instantly tired one-note jokes. Worst of all was McKinnon return to the spotlight, her utterly grating performance throughout only serving as a reminder at how much of an albatross she’s become to the show (when she shows up, that is). Hopefully, next week’s episode – the last of 2021 – will see a massive improvement in quality. After viewing tonight’s offering, that would be a Christmas miracle.",Arts/Television & radio,Saturday Night Live: Billie Eilish pulls double duty but festive cheer is hard to muster,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/12/saturday-night-live-billie-eilish
12/13/2021,"Goldman Sachs will start training apprentices directly on its London trading floor for the first time next year, feeding into wider efforts to boost social mobility across the UK’s financial sector. The programme, which is part of an apprenticeship scheme launched in partnership with Queen Mary University of London, will combine paid on-the-job training with study over four years, offering students a chance to gain hands-on experience in a sector still struggling to attract candidates from less-affluent backgrounds.  The programme, which opens for recruitment on Monday, comes nearly a year after the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy launched an independent taskforce to address a lack of socioeconomic diversity across financial and professional services, after research found that just under half of senior City roles were held by white men who attended an independent or selective state school. A 2019 study by KPMG also found that 41% of people working in finance across the UK had parents in the same sector, far higher than the national average of 12%, raising concerns about a lack of access to City roles for less-privileged students. “As an industry, we are still not doing a good enough job at appealing to students from a more diverse socioeconomic background,” Daniel Freckleton, a managing director in global markets at Goldman Sachs, said. “There is of course an interplay between socio-economic background and ethnic minorities, so working to improve social mobility in our recruitment process is likely to have knock-on benefits to our racial diversity too,” he added. Freckleton is one of the few black managing directors on the the bank’s London trading floor. He is the main sponsor of the apprenticeship scheme. While some banks have launched apprenticeship schemes in the UK, most have been focused on back-office roles. Goldman’s programme is believed to be the first scheme aimed at bringing trainees directly onto the trading floor of an investment bank. The Goldman scheme will start by selecting 10 candidates to start the scheme in September 2022, with an opportunity to increase its cohort in following years. Students will earn a “competitive” annual salary alongside their studies and will be eligible for a bonus, helping avoid student debt, by working five days a week on the trading floor. They will also study at Queen Mary’s school of economic and finance for two one-week “teaching sprints” per semester. The academic programme will consist of lectures and assessments, covering topics ranging from assets pricing to machine learning. Goldman will pay for relocation and equipment such as books and laptops as needed, to help students who might otherwise struggle to cover the costs of formal training. Candidates will also be eligible for a full-time role at Goldman at the end of their course. Recruitment is open to students from all educational backgrounds, but will be broadly aimed at people coming from state education. “We want to attract the brightest and best students from as diverse a talent pool as possible – that’s diversity of socio-economic background as much as anything else,” Freckleton said. “Unfortunately, we’re currently missing out on a lot of this talent, either because students are put off by the traditional recruitment process, the financial barriers of university study, or simply because they are not aware of the kinds of jobs that Goldman has to offer them.”",News/Business,Goldman Sachs starts trading floor apprenticeship scheme to boost diversity,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/12/goldman-sachs-starts-trading-floor-apprenticeship-scheme-to-boost-diversity
