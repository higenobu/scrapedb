5/17/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) -Turkey's foreign minister said on Sunday that Sweden and Finland must stop supporting terrorist groups in their countries, provide clear security guarantees and lift export bans on Turkey as they seek membership in NATO. Speaking after a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Berlin, Mevlut Cavusoglu said he met his Swedish and Finnish counterparts and all were seeking to address Turkey's concerns. He added that Turkey was not threatening anybody or seeking leverage but speaking out especially about Sweden's support for the PKK Kurdish militant group, deemed a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and the United States. Finland confirmed on Sunday that it would apply for NATO membership and Sweden is expected to follow suit, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However Turkey's concerns may pose an obstacle, as any decision on NATO enlargement requires unanimous approval by all 30 member states. ""There absolutely needs to be security guarantees here. They need to stop supporting terrorist organizations,"" Cavusoglu told Turkish reporters in Berlin. He added that Swedish and Finnish bans on exporting of some of their defence sector goods to Turkey must end. ""Our stance is perfectly open and clear. This is not a threat, this is not a negotiation where we're trying to leverage our interests,"" he said. ""This is not populism either. This is clearly about two potential member states' support for terrorism, and our solid observations about it, this is what we shared."" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan surprised NATO allies and the Nordic countries on Friday when he said Turkey could not support the enlargement plans given they were ""home to many terrorist organisations"", but his spokesperson told Reuters on Saturday that Turkey had not shut the door. Cavusoglu repeated that Turkey, which joined NATO 70 years ago, does not oppose its open door policy. He said the talks with Swedish and Finnish counterparts were good and that they made suggestions to alleviate Ankara's legitimate concerns, which Turkey would consider. He said he provided them proof of terrorists living in their states. Cavusoglu again singled out Sweden as disrespecting Turkey's position and said PKK terrorist meetings took place in Stockholm over the weekend.

5/17/2022,"A lavish Bel Air mansion listed for $87.8 million reportedly received just half the asking price when it went to auction last week. According to CNBC, the highest bid for the property was just under $45.8 million—around 52% of the mammoth asking price. The mansion, located at 777 Sarbonne Road in Bel Air, Calif., was auctioned online by Concierge Auctions earlier this month. On top of its seven bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, and “dramatic views of Los Angeles,” the property boasts a range of unique features including a retractable hydraulic DJ table, a feng shui koi pond, and a glass elevator. The house also comes complete with an infinity pool, a two-bedroom guesthouse, and an underground wine cellar. While the sale is pending, the auction house is still accepting backup bids. The buyer of the property will pay a 5% buyer’s premium on top of the final price, according to the listing. If it does go through at the current price, it would be the fourth most expensive home to ever sell at auction. The property’s seller, celebrity dermatologist and developer Alex Khadavi, told CNBC the auction results were “horrible, horrible, horrible."" ""Nobody told me this thing’s going to go below, below this level,” he added. Back in April, he told the Wall Street Journal the property would sell for more than its $50 million reserve price. However, with the highest bid apparently coming in around $4.2 million under Khadavi’s reserve price, this has left both seller and agent highly disappointed. “Honestly, I’m not happy,” co-listing agent Aaron Kirman of Compass told CNBC. “We wanted more.” Although sellers aren’t usually obligated to accept a bid below the reserve, this sale may be forced to go ahead as part of Khadavi’s bankruptcy proceedings, and therefore was auctioned under more complex circumstances than a regular sale. Khadavi is now reportedly racing to find another buyer who could offer more than the auction’s highest bid. A spokesperson for Concierge Auctions was not available for comment when contacted by Fortune, but the company’s president, Chad Roffers, offered this statement to CNBC: “With over 80 qualified showings in the last 60 days, we are confident market value was delivered.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune,Bel Air megamansion listed for $87.8 million flops at auction and the celebrity developer seller is furious,https://news.yahoo.com/bel-air-mega-mansion-listed-161003169.html
5/17/2022,"A child porn investigation took another disgusting turn when Vancouver police officers found a video of a man peeing in milkshake mix at an Arby’s restaurant, Washington authorities reported. The man, a night manager at the restaurant, told police he urinated in the milkshake mix for sexual gratification at least twice, Vancouver police said in a news release. Police found no indication that Arby’s or other employees were aware of the incidents. “The alleged actions of the former franchised employee are abhorrent and unacceptable,” an Arby’s spokesperson said in a statement to KTTV. “We have taken immediate action with the franchise group who terminated the former employee and is fully cooperating with the authorities in their investigation.” Investigators are seeking anyone who bought a milkshake at the 221 NE 104th Ave. restaurant on Oct. 30 or Oct. 31, the release said. They ask that anyone with a receipt or verified transaction information contact detective Robert Givens at robert.givens@cityofvancouver.us. Another Arby’s manager told police the restaurant sold at least one ice cream float and 30 to 40 milkshakes Oct. 30, The Columbian reported. Detectives in a child porn investigation contacted the man May 10, the release said. He admitted downloading and distributing child pornography, police said. A search of his phone and other digital devices uncovered “dozens of photos and videos depicting the sexual exploitation of children,” the release said. The search also uncovered a video of the man urinating in milkshake mix containers, police said. The man faces charges of possessing and distributing child pornography and assault, the release said. Detectives are still investigating his digital devices.

5/17/2022,"By Ali Kucukgocmen ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Swedish and Finnish delegations should not bother coming to Ankara to convince it to approve their NATO bid. Sweden's government has formally decided to apply for NATO membership, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said on Monday, a day after Finnish President Sauli Niinisto confirmed that Helsinki will also apply for membership. Turkey surprised its NATO allies last week by saying it would not view their applications positively, mainly citing their history of hosting members of groups Ankara deems terrorists. In a news conference on Monday, Erdogan repeated that Turkey would not approve their bids to join NATO, calling Sweden a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations, and adding it had terrorists in its parliament. ""Neither of these countries have a clear, open attitude towards terrorist organisation,"" Erdogan said. ""How can we trust them?"" The Swedish foreign office said earlier on Monday that senior representatives of Sweden and Finland plan to travel to Turkey for talks to address Ankara's objections. ""They are coming to Turkey on Monday. Are they coming to convince us? Excuse me but they should not tire themselves,"" Erdogan said about the planned visit. Erdogan said NATO would become ""a place where representatives of terrorist organisations are concentrated"" if the two countries join. Ankara says Sweden and Finland harbor people it says are linked to groups it deems terrorists, namely the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group and followers of Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt. Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber said on Monday that Sweden and Finland had not granted approval for the repatriation of 33 people that Turkey requested. Erdogan also said Turkey would oppose the NATO bids from those who imposed sanctions on it. Sweden and Finland had slapped arms export embargoes on Turkey after its Syria incursion in 2019. NATO and the United States said they were confident Turkey would not hold up membership of Finland and Sweden. Diplomats said Erdogan would be under pressure to yield as Finland and Sweden would greatly strengthen NATO in the Baltic Sea. Erdogan's spokesman said on Saturday that Turkey has not shut the door to Sweden and Finland joining NATO but wants negotiations and a clampdown on what it sees as terrorist activities.

5/17/2022,"A graduating student at Duke University faced heavy criticism after delivering a commencement address that shared “striking similarities” with a Harvard University graduation speech from 2014.

During her commencement ceremony on May 8, speaker Priya Parkash called her school “the Duke nation” and said it could become its own country due to its various associations and landmarks.

Parkash, who is originally from Pakistan, said that “if Duke were to dig a moat around its perimeter and fill that with water, it could be its own tiny island nation, like Cuba or maybe even Sri Lanka.”

 

Duke’s student newspaper The Chronicle would later point out that several metaphors and rhetoric from Parkash’s speech have similarities to those from a previous commencement address at Harvard.

During her speech for Harvard’s Class of 2014, Sarah Abushaar mentioned “the Harvard nation” and declared that her university could be its own country if it “shut its gates.”

The Chronicle highlighted other lines from the two speeches that are seemingly too identical to be mere coincidence.

Abushaar, who was raised in Kuwait, said that her campus’ statue of John Harvard is Harvard’s own Statue of Liberty, while the Harvard Alumni Association is its tax collection agency. Abushaar also noted that her university’s endowment is “larger than more than half of the world's countries' GDPs.”

Meanwhile, Parkash compared Duke’s statue of James Buchanan Duke to Christ the Redeemer, the iconic statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro. She also compared the Duke Alumni Association to a tax collection agency, noting that Duke’s endowment is “larger than the GDP of one third of the countries in the world.”

In both speeches, the speakers said their time at their respective universities gave them “diplomatic passports,” which helped them pass through U.S. immigration without any issues. Additionally, wearing university gear no longer made them a “national security threat” at the airport.

“I made sure I dressed like our overly proud Harvard dads, with Harvard hat, Harvard shirt, Harvard shorts and Harvard underwear,” Abushaar shared.

“I would be sure to raid the Duke store like our overly enthusiastic Duke moms and dads sitting here today,” Parkash said in her speech. “We’re talking Duke cap, Duke sweatshirt, Duke sweatpants, Duke sunglasses, Duke slides and even Duke underwear.”

After successfully passing U.S. immigration, Abushar noted that “suddenly all the gates to the American Dream opened wide.” Meanwhile, Parkash said that “the doors to this whole new world of possibilities flung wide open.”

Michael Schoenfeld, Duke University’s vice president for public affairs and government relations, sent a statement to The Chronicle acknowledging the allegations and noted that they have “initiated a process to understand the facts of the situation.""

""Duke expects all students to abide by their commitment to the Duke Community Standard in everything they do as students,"" he added.

On May 11, Parkash released a statement acknowledging the similarities between the two speeches, which she attributed to “suggested passages” by “respected friends and family.”

“When I was asked to give the commencement speech, I was thrilled by such an honor and I sought advice from respected friends and family about topics I might address,” Parkash wrote. “I was embarrassed and confused to find out too late that some of the suggested passages were taken from a recent commencement speech at another university. I take full responsibility for this oversight and I regret if this incident has in any way distracted from the accomplishments of the Duke class of 2022.”

Abushaar also released a statement via The Crimson, noting that she hopes Parkash can use the “serious error in judgment” as an “opportunity to learn and grow.”

“The goal of my address was to inspire young people, and especially young women, from all backgrounds to break barriers in striving for their aims and to have the courage to use their voices to share their stories and serve as forces of good,” she said.

5/17/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted a meeting of the Russian-led military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), on Monday on the 30th anniversary of its founding—but the meeting was anything but celebratory. Instead, the heads of state from Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, which make up the collective defense organization, akin to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, went to the Kremlin Monday in Moscow to lament the world’s response to Putin’s war in Ukraine. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, sitting in a massive room with sweeping high ceilings and ornate, gold-covered walls, whined about “hellish” sanctions from the West and efforts to isolate Russia and Belarus—which has been supporting Putin’s military moves in Ukraine—from the rest of the world. “Belarus and Russia… are being defamed and excluded from international organizations at the whim of the West,” Lukashenko said. In a joint statement, the CSTO also stated that it is concerned about “external borders of the CSTO,” noting that they maintain “readiness to ensure the security of the borders.” Top U.S. Spy Spills on Putin’s ‘Drastic’ Secret Plan to Win War But Lukashenko complained that the members of the alliance haven’t been banding behind Russia as much as they should, especially as Russia works to address NATO’s expansion, a common argument Russian officials and allies have been using to justify the war in Ukraine. In a likely reference to Finland and Sweden expressing interest in joining NATO, Lukashenko called for more support as NATO’s threats continue, from “NATO saber-rattling near our western borders to a full-scale hybrid war unleashed against us,” according to Interfax. “Russia should not fight alone against the expansion of NATO,” he said. Putin himself complained about a “surge in frenzied Russophobia in the so-called civilized and politically correct Western countries,” and promised the expansion of NATO would “certainly evoke a response on our part. We will see what it will be like based on the threats that are created for us.” Putin also demanded that his counterparts do more for Russia in the future, citing what he claimed was “documentary evidence” found during the invasion in Ukraine that he said allegedly shows that “components of biological weapons were developed in close proximity to our borders.” Meeting of CSTO leaders started in Moscow https://t.co/gi5oOEtgr6 pic.twitter.com/QFZLc9hYHC — Liveuamap (@Liveuamap) May 16, 2022 To respond to those alleged biological weapons threats—threats Putin has said Russia has faced for some time—Putin rallied CSTO members during the meeting to agree to demonstrate their combined military might by running joint CSTO exercises this fall in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. “Efforts to maintain biological security also require the most serious attention,” he said. Putin also seemed to be pushing his counterparts to prop up his bogus justification for conducting the “special” military operation in Ukraine—to denazify the country. “I would like to highlight our priority task of jointly defending the memory of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, the feat of our peoples who saved the world from Nazism at the cost of enormous and irreparable sacrifices, and to counteract any attempts to whitewash the Nazis, their accomplices and modern followers,” Putin said, noting that he thinks Ukrainians are glorifying Nazis at the state level. After the summit, the group noted in a statement that other countries have been critical of Russia’s false claim that it invaded Ukraine to try to denazify the country, insisting that it is indeed the aim of the war, rather than a false pretense to invade. This photo of Putin meeting with his ""partners"" in the CSTO today is certainly illustrative.Normally, we use round tables in diplomacy to give everyone equal prominence - there's no head of the table. But Putin found a way; there is no doubt who's in charge in this picture. pic.twitter.com/bTUrfZO9RG — Corey Hogan (@coreyhogan) May 16, 2022 We “strongly condemn any attempts to falsify historical events related to our common contribution to countering Nazi aggression,” the CSTO said in a statement. “We express serious concern in connection with attempts to ban symbols associated with the Victory over Nazism.” The Putin-centric pity party comes as Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its 82nd day, with no end in sight—the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessed last week the war, which has shifted to the east of Ukraine, has nearly reached a “stalemate.” Putin’s military continues to flounder in Ukraine. As of Monday, Russian forces have lost 27,700 troops, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in an analysis Monday. But even though the fighting is reaching a protracted state, the Biden administration is still focused on providing security assistance to Ukraine to help thwart Russian attacks. The administration has already provided $300 million in security assistance to Ukraine just this fiscal year, with more expected soon. ‘Let Someone Whack You’: Russian Troops Are Now Deliberately Wounding Themselves to Get Out of Putin’s War  Putin’s CSTO pity party bemoaned the west’s military assistance to Ukraine, which the U.S. Defense Department has assessed has helped the Ukrainians’ resistance to Russian advances in the war. “So far, in the West, including in Washington, we see only a desire to prolong the conflict as much as possible,” Lukashenko said, referring to military aid. “The goals are clear: to weaken Russia as much as possible.” Nonetheless, the aid is set to keep flowing. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed other weapons and security assistance during a meeting this weekend in Berlin with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. And later this week, the Senate is expected to vote on $40 billion of aid to Ukraine, Senate Republican Leader Mitch MicConnell said Saturday. Read more at The Daily Beast.

The Defence Ministry said on Monday Zelenskiy had appointed Major General Ihor Tantsyura to take over from Yuriy Halushkin as commander of the forces that are helping the Ukrainian army defend the country following Russia's invasion on Feb. 24. The ministry described Tantsyura as an experienced officer who was previously chief of staff of Ukraine's ground forces. It said the Territorial Defence Forces had grown rapidly since being established shortly before the invasion and were playing an important role in the conflict with Russia. ""The explosive growth of the structure, especially in conditions of intense combat, is a huge experience, (with)mistakes and achievements. There are successes and, unfortunately, losses,"" the ministry said in a statement.

5/17/2022,"An animal dashed down a busy road in Montana and into a cemetery. Jessica Jaeger and her husband, Dylan Heiner, spotted the critter in Butte and knew this wasn’t an animal they had typically seen. “We were driving down a fairly busy road in Butte when he ran out of a neighborhood and into the cemetery,” Jaeger told McClatchy News. “We had no idea what he was because of how he was running, so we followed him.” The couple was experiencing a rare sight. The animal was an elusive and rarely seen wolverine, wildlife officials told McClatchy News. The Montana Standard first reported the May 2 sighting. Wolverine sightings are rare, especially in populated areas, Molly Parks, carnivore coordinator for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks told McClatchy News. “They are typically found in remote, high elevation areas and are solitary and quite elusive,” Parks said in an email. The couple didn’t know it initially, but they did their own research to determine they saw a wolverine. They were blown away. “It felt pretty special since it’s very rare for them to be in town like that,” Jaeger said. Wolverines can be between 38 and 47 inches long, and weigh between 13 and 31 pounds, according to the National Park Service. They’re “active year-round” and breed from April to October, according to the National Park Service. During the winter months, they “den in deep snow.” Wolverines were nearly extinct in Montana in the 1900s but its population has since grown, according to Fish, Wildlife and Parks. Now they can be found in remote locations such as Glacier National Park, the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex and near Yellowstone National Park, according to Lee Enterprises. In March, a tour group at Yellowstone National Park spotted an elusive wolverine walking on the road in front of them, McClatchy News reported. No other vehicles were around, and the tour group spent 3 minutes watching the wolverine. “We turned around to make our way back, when I saw what I thought was a black bear running down the road,” Carl Kemp, a person on the tour, said on YouTube. “As soon as it turned, we realized we were in the middle of a once in a lifetime experience.” One of rarest animals in Yellowstone emerges near ‘elated’ tour group, video shows Wildlife officials capture ‘elusive’ animal only seen eight times in 43 years in Utah Tangle of odd string photographed in Arizona water is hiding eggs.

5/17/2022,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The regiment that doggedly defended a steel mill as Ukraine's last stronghold in the port city of Mariupol declared its mission complete Monday after more than 260 fighters, including some badly wounded, were evacuated and taken to areas under Russia’s control. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the evacuation to separatist-controlled territory was done to save the lives of the fighters who endured weeks of Russian assaults in the maze of underground passages below the hulking Azovstal steelworks. He said the “heavily wounded” were getting medical help. “Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It’s our principle,” he said. An unknown number of fighters stayed behind to await other rescue efforts. The steel mill’s defenders got out as Moscow suffered another diplomatic setback in its war with Ukraine, with Sweden joining Finland in deciding to seek NATO membership. And Ukraine made a symbolic gain when its forces reportedly pushed Russian troops back to the Russian border in the Kharkiv region. Still, Russian forces pounded targets in the industrial heartland of eastern Ukraine known as the Donbas, and the death toll, already many thousands, kept climbing with the war set to enter its 12th week on Wednesday. Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said 53 seriously wounded fighters were taken from the Azovstal plant to a hospital in Novoazovsk, east of Mariupol. An additional 211 fighters were evacuated to Olenivka through a humanitarian corridor. She said an exchange would be worked out for their return home. Officials also planned to keep trying to save the fighters who remained inside. “The work to bring the guys home continues, and it requires delicacy and time,"" Zelenskyy said. Before Monday's evacuations from the steelworks began, the Russian Defense Ministry announced an agreement for the wounded to leave the mill for treatment in a town held by pro-Moscow separatists. There was no immediate word on whether the wounded would be considered prisoners of war. After nightfall Monday, several buses pulled away from the steel mill accompanied by Russian military vehicles. Maliar later confirmed that the evacuation had taken place. “Thanks to the defenders of Mariupol, Ukraine gained critically important time to form reserves and regroup forces and receive help from partners,” she said. “And they fulfilled all their tasks. But it is impossible to unblock Azovstal by military means.” The commander of the Azov Regiment, which led the defense of the plant, said in a prerecorded video message released Monday that the evacuation marked the end of the regiment’s mission. “Absolutely safe plans and operations don’t exist during war,"" Lt. Col. Denis Prokopenko said, adding that all risks were considered and part of the plan included saving “as many lives of personnel as possible.” Elsewhere in the Donbas, the eastern city of Sievierdonetsk came under heavy shelling that killed at least 10 people, said Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region. In the Donetsk region, Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Facebook that nine civilians were killed in shelling. The western Ukrainian city of Lviv was rocked by loud explosions early Tuesday. Witnesses counted at least eight blasts accompanied by distant booms, and the smell of burning was apparent some time later. An Associated Press team in Lviv, which was under an overnight curfew, said the sky west of the city was lit up by an orange glow. But Ukrainian troops also advanced as Russian forces pulled back from around the northeastern city of Kharkiv in recent days. Zelenskyy thanked the soldiers who reportedly pushed them all the way to the Russian border in the Kharkiv region. Video showed Ukrainian soldiers carrying a post that resembled a Ukrainian blue-and-yellow-striped border marker. Then they placed it on the ground while a dozen of the soldiers posed next to it, including one with belts of bullets draped over a shoulder. “I’m very grateful to you, on behalf of all Ukrainians, on my behalf and on behalf of my family,"" Zelenskyy said in a video message. ""I’m very grateful to all the fighters like you.” The Ukrainian border service said the video showing the soldiers was from the border “in the Kharkiv region,” but would not elaborate, citing security reasons. It was not immediately possible to verify the exact location. Ukrainian border guards said they also stopped a Russian attempt to send sabotage and reconnaissance troops into the Sumy region, some 90 miles (146 kilometers) northwest of Kharkiv. Russia has been plagued by setbacks in the war, most glaringly in its failure early on to take the capital of Kyiv. Much of the fighting has shifted to the Donbas but also has turned into a slog, with both sides fighting village-by-village. Howitzers from the U.S. and other countries have helped Kyiv hold off or gain ground against Russia, a senior U.S. defense official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the U.S. military assessment, said Ukraine has pushed Russian forces to within a half-mile to 2.5 miles (1 to 4 kilometers) of Russia’s border but could not confirm if it was all the way to the frontier. The official said Russian long-range strikes also appeared to target a Ukrainian military training center in Yavoriv, near the Polish border. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Away from the battlefield, Sweden's decision to seek NATO membership followed a similar decision by neighboring Finland in a historic shift for the counties, which were nonaligned for generations. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said her country would be in a “vulnerable position” during the application period and urged her fellow citizens to brace themselves. “Russia has said that that it will take countermeasures if we join NATO,” she said. “We cannot rule out that Sweden will be exposed to, for instance, disinformation and attempts to intimidate and divide us.” But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a NATO member, ratcheted up his objection to their joining. He accused the countries of failing to take a “clear” stance against Kurdish militants and other groups that Ankara considers terrorists, and of imposing military sanctions on Turkey. He said Swedish and Finnish officials who are expected in Turkey next week should not bother to come if they intend to try to convince Turkey of dropping its objection. “How can we trust them?” Erdogan asked at a joint news conference with the visiting Algerian president. All 30 current NATO members must agree to let the Nordic neighbors join. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow “does not have a problem” with Sweden or Finland as they apply for NATO membership, but that “the expansion of military infrastructure onto this territory will of course give rise to our reaction in response.” Putin launched the invasion on Feb. 24 in what he said was an effort to check NATO’s expansion but has seen that strategy backfire. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said the membership process for both could be quick. Europe is also working to choke off funding  for the Kremlin's war by reducing the billions of dollars it spends on imports of Russian energy. A proposed EU embargo faces opposition from some countries dependent on Russian imports, including Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Bulgaria also has reservations. ___ McQuillan reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

5/17/2022,"In a Dallas suburb last week, a whip-cracking 9-year-old white boy came to the front porch of one of his neighbors and banged on their door while demanding to confront a Black child in the home. A Ring camera video of the moment went viral after it was posted to social media. The parents of the Black girl, Carissa Nash and her husband Dee Nash, say they posted the video to highlight how local law enforcement told them the boy is too young to face any criminal penalties. But the boy’s father, Bryan Thomas Brunson, is not, and he later would be arrested for his actions in the aftermath of the incident. “This kid comes to my door with a whip looking for my 9-year-old daughter, then puts a big ass scratch on our Audi,” Carissa wrote of the incident that took place on Thursday, May 12, in Kaufman County Texas. “The police came out and tells us, ‘it’ll work itself out since he moving soon.’” She also communicated what happened when they went to the child’s home. Saying that when her husband returned home, the two of them went to talk to the child and his family “about the damages done” to their vehicle. First, the mom says she could hear the boy’s father tell him to lie and say he is not home, but minutes later the man emerges and “comes to the door with a gun.” “He almost shot himself and his daughter standing behind him,” she wrote. The couple posted a video of their visit to the 9-year-old’s home on YouTube. In the footage, Dee is seen talking to the father, who says the reason why he has a Ruger semi-automatic pistol is because they have had beef before. Dee then attempts to show the man the Ring video of what transpired at their home, but Brunson tells them to leave his property. An argument ensues between the two men in Brunson’s driveway, and the boy’s father places the firearm on the ground. When he picks it up, he accidentally pulls the trigger, and the camera records the sound of a shot. Carissa is heard saying, “y’all is so violent.” The Nashes called the police and were told no charges could be filed on the boy because he was a 9, a year too young to face criminal mischief charges. However, TMZ reports that the Kaufman County Constable Precinct 2 Chief Administrator Jason Johnson, confirmed the bullet almost struck Brunson’s own daughter who was standing behind him. The father reportedly was hit with a felony charge of deadly conduct. The Nashes, who have made multiple somewhat inconsistent social media posts about why the boy was at their door, say it all started because the upset boy claimed he got into a fight with the couple’s 13-year-old son — although another narrative says it was their 9-year-old daughter — while he was coming home from school. The couple contends it would have been impossible for the son to be involved because the two minors attend separate schools. “The kid claimed as he was walking home and was jumped by our son,” Dee Nash said online. “Our son is 13 years old. He gets out of school two hours after the 9-year-old gets out of school. So there’s no way our son could have touched or even seen this 9-year-old kid.” The Nashes also say this is not the first incident they’ve encountered with this same boy, stating the boy has claimed that their son assaulted him before. The father says he has social media posts dating back to 2019 regarding the blond child. Dee and Carissa Nash both took to Instagram with videos offering an account of what precipitated Thursday’s events, saying the white boy and their 9-year-old daughter, Jordan, had tussled earlier that day. “We spoke with a group of kids that walk home with a 9-year-old, as well as my daughter, and the entire group,” the father shared. “The 9-year-old kid was saying rude things to the group of kids.” Carissa Nash said the boy shouted out racial slurs to the other kids. Other Black children allegedly got into an altercation with the child, and he took his skateboard and started hitting the others around him. He struck one girl and her brother beat him up. Carissa said, “There was a brother and he got in there and said, ‘I had to defend my sister. He was hitting my sister.’” The couple claims what happened next was the 9-year-old hit the Nashes’ daughter, Jordan Nash, and she defended herself. The child was furious that the girl was fighting back. To make matters worse, while she was fighting the child, another boy pushed him from the back into some water. When he got up, the first person he saw was Jordan and he viciously attacked her. Jordan came home and told Carissa what the entire ordeal was. While they were talking the boy came to the door. A Ring camera, located on the Nash family’s door, captured the boy approaching their porch and banging on the door. In his hands, he had a whip and he snapped it a couple of times at the door. He waited for someone to answer his frantic address. When Carissa opened the door, she chastised him for causing such a ruckus and disrespecting her home. She is heard on the clip saying, “Little boy, you better get your ass up and off my porch before I call the police, beating on my door like this! I will call the police, you need to leave. Don’t you ever beat on my godd-mn like that. GO!” He pouted as he left the property.",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,"Texas 9-Year-Old Brings a Whip to a Black Family’s Porch to Demand Their Daughter Emerge; Boy’s Father Fumbles with Gun When Confronted, Nearly Shoots His Own Child",https://news.yahoo.com/texas-9-old-brings-whip-183000134.html
5/17/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that there was no threat to Russia if Sweden and Finland joined NATO but cautioned that Moscow would respond if the U.S.-led alliance bolstered military infrastructure in the new Nordic members. Putin, Russia's paramount leader since 1999, has repeatedly cited the post-Soviet enlargement of the NATO alliance eastwards toward Russia's borders as a reason for the conflict of Ukraine. But Putin, who has in recent months rattled Russia's nuclear sabre at the West over Ukraine, made an unusually calm response to Finland and Sweden's bids to join NATO, the biggest strategic consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine to date. ""As to enlargement, Russia has no problem with these states - none. And so in this sense there is no immediate threat to Russia from an expansion (of NATO) to include these countries,"" Putin told the leaders of a Russian-dominated military alliance of former Soviet states. Putin, though, laced his newly found tranquillity on NATO with a warning. ""But the expansion of military infrastructure into this territory would certainly provoke our response,"" Putin said. ""What that (response) will be - we will see what threats are created for us,"" Putin told the leaders of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), which includes Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The Kremlin chief's remarkably serene response to one of Russia's most sensitive geopolitical worries - the post-Soviet enlargement of NATO - contrasted to some tougher language from his foreign ministry and senior allies. Before Putin spoke, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the West should have no illusions that Moscow would simply put up with the Nordic expansion of NATO. Those comments were still being played up on state television. One of Putin's closest allies, former President Dmitry Medvedev, said last month that Russia could deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad if Finland and Sweden joined NATO. NO PROBLEM NATO Speaking in the Grand Kremlin Palace, Putin read a short speech that touched on NATO and scolded the United States for creating biological laboratories in the former Soviet Union. Putin said Russia had evidence that the United States had been trying to create components of biological weapons in Ukraine, a claim Washington and Kyiv have denied. Besides NATO's ""endless expansion policy"", Putin said the alliance was reaching far beyond its Euro-Atlantic remit - a trend he said that Russia was following carefully. Moscow says NATO threatens Russia and that Washington has repeatedly ignored the Kremlin's concerns about the security of its borders in the West, the source of two devastating European invasions in 1812 and 1941. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia through NATO enlargement and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people. Putin says assurances were given as the Soviet Union collapsed that the alliance would not expand eastwards toward Russia, a promise he says was a lie. The United States and NATO dispute that such assurances were given explicitly. Kyiv and its Western backers say the claim of persecution of Russian speakers has been exaggerated by Moscow into a pretext for an unprovoked war against a sovereign state. The West says NATO - an alliance of 30 countries including former Warsaw Pact republics such as Poland and Hungary as well as nuclear powers such as the United States, Britain and France - is purely defensive.

5/17/2022,"Russian president Vladimir Putin once said that any more countries on Russia’s doorstep joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) constituted a threat to Russia, and would provoke “military and political consequences.” In fact, Putin warned last year that NATO expanding its military infrastructure eastward into Ukraine would be a “red line” for Russia and perceived as a direct threat. But three months into a Ukraine invasion that’s not going according to plan, and after two other countries close to Russia announced that they are joining NATO, Putin appears to be softening his tone, and resigning himself to the fact that NATO’s eastward expansion is happening anyway. On Sunday, Finland—which shares an 800-mile border with Russia and was part of the Russian Empire for over a century—said it had applied to join NATO to ensure that its own national security would not be threatened by Russia in the future. On Monday, Sweden followed suit after a meeting amongst ruling party officials over the weekend, who voted to end the country’s 200-year neutrality policy. “The issue at hand is whether military nonalignment will keep serving us well?” Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said on Sunday. “We’re facing a fundamentally changed security environment in Europe.” For months, Russian officials have warned against the two countries taking this decisive step, but now that it has actually happened, Putin appears to be doing his best to diminish the significance of the act. ""As for the expansion of NATO, including through new members of the alliance which are Finland, Sweden — Russia has no problems with these states,” Putin said Monday at a summit of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a military alliance composed of several post-Soviet states. For months, Russian officials have been saying that should Finland and Sweden join NATO, Russia would receive it as a threat, and respond by building up its military capabilities in the Baltic Sea. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev even suggested in April that nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles could be deployed. Just last week, Putin warned that Finland joining NATO would be a “mistake,” and suggested that Russia would interpret it as an act of aggression. But Putin signaled on Monday that Finland and Sweden’s decision to join NATO is one of relative unimportance, and does not constitute a danger to Russia. ""Expansion at the expense of these countries does not pose a direct threat to Russia,” he said. Putin also called NATO’s geographic expansion “artificial,” suggesting that the alliance’s spread is more symbolic in nature than anything else, despite having previously repeatedly requested assurances that NATO would not expand into Ukraine, something that Putin claims justified the invasion. Should Finland’s membership be approved, it would double the length of NATO’s border with Russia. Finland and Sweden joining NATO marks a historic shift in their foreign policy stances, as both countries are reversing their long-standing military neutrality policies in what is widely considered an  admonishment to Russia and publicly for  the West. Putin’s apparent reversal on the importance of Sweden and Finland joining NATO was a surprise to many Russia watchers, but the Russian president is suggesting that he will react more aggressively should either country become a military threat to Russia. Putin signaled on Monday that Russia might step up its military presence in the Baltics if the alliance decides to set up military bases or station weapons in Finland or Sweden, although did not indicate whether he would be willing to authorize sending nuclear weapons or heavy-duty missiles to the region. “The expansion of military infrastructure into this territory will certainly cause our response. We will see what it will be based on the threats that will be created for us,"" Putin said. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has said that NATO military bases and nuclear weapons are not welcome in the country, and that it does not intend to militarize to counter Russia. But even if Putin is playing down the threat, and Nordic countries want to keep militarization out of it, joining NATO will inevitably create more “military tension” in the region, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said recently.

5/17/2022,"By Rocky Swift TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's ""Kill Bill"" restaurant operator prevailed in a court case on Monday that declared Tokyo's now defunct COVID-19 infection curbs were illegal. The orders, enacted in the capital during various states of emergency, included shortened operating hours and a ban on alcohol sales, though there was a compensating government subsidy. Businesses that didn't comply were subject to fines. Global-Dining Inc, which runs more than 40 restaurants, defied the restrictions, taking the city government to court over the matter. The district court said the Tokyo government had not provided a ""rational explanation"" for the measures. The court determined they had been illegal but it denied Global-Dining's claim for 104 yen ($0.80) in damages. The restrictions ended in March. Whether this ruling would inhibit the city government in acting against any renewed COVID-19 outbreak is unclear. In a statement, Global-Dining president Kozo Hasegawa, said the case revealed the ""injustice and sloppiness of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government."" His company crowd-funded more than 25 million yen to fight the case.

5/17/2022,"Elon Musk's excuse about Twitter bots is a way to back out of the deal, Wedbush said. Musk agreed to buy Twitter for $44 billion but could be feeling pressure amid falling Tesla stock. ""We view the $44 billion Twitter deal as having less than a 50% [chance] to get done,"" Wedbush said. There is now a less than 50% chance that Elon Musk will acquire Twitter for $44 billion, a Monday note from Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst, said. Musk, who plans to put up a big chunk of his Tesla stake to finance the Twitter buyout, raised concerns last week about the proliferation of bots on the social-media platform, adding that until his concern was sorted out, the deal would be on hold. Musk's sudden concern about bots sent Twitter shares plunging 10% on Friday. Ives said he viewed Musk's concern about bots as a ""dog ate the homework"" excuse that the billionaire could use to either back out of the deal or lower the price of his proposed buyout, $54.20 a share. ""Our view is while Musk is committed to the deal the massive pressure on Tesla's stock since the deal, a changing stock market/risk environment the last month, and a number of other financing factors has caused Musk to get 'cold feet' on the Twitter deal with the bot issue not a new issue and likely more of a scapegoat to push for a lower price,"" Wedbush said. Bots have always been a concern for Twitter, but Jack Dorsey, the platform's founder and former CEO, largely cleared up much of the bot issue over the past few years, according to Ives. But Musk's apparent pause on the deal until he is comfortable with the bot situation puts Twitter between a rock and a hard place, as no other strategic or financial bidder has stepped forward and matched Musk's offer for the company. ""And Musk knows that, which is why in a changing market and with Tesla losing ~$300 billion of market cap since the deal we view the $44 billion Twitter deal as having less than a 50% [chance] to get done as of today,"" Ives said. If the deal doesn't get done, Twitter will collect a $1 billion breakup fee, but that's still not going to prevent the stock from plunging to below $30, Ives said. ""Musk is still committed to the deal per his tweets and appears like he wants to get it done, but the financing stress and equity financing overhang on his golden child Tesla has cast a long shadow on this deal,"" Ives said. Tesla's stock popped more than 5% on Friday as investors likely warmed to the idea of Musk not going through with his deal to buy Twitter, which would make him less likely to sell a big chunk of his shares. ""The bot issue at the end of the day was known by the New York City cab driver and feels more to us like the 'dog ate the homework' excuse to bail on the Twitter deal or talk down a lower price,"" Ives said.

5/17/2022,"Price levels continue to rise at a rate we haven’t seen in decades. In April, U.S. consumer prices surged 8.3% — down slightly from 8.5% in March, but still near 40-year highs. Spiking inflation has severe consequences for your cash savings. Fortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has plenty of advice on what to own when consumer prices spike. In a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two business traits that investors should look for when trying to fight inflation: 1) the power to increase prices easily, and 2) the ability to take on more business without having to spend excessively. Here are four Berkshire holdings that largely boast those characteristics. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Last year, American Express demonstrated its pricing power as it raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card from $550 to $695. The company also stands to directly benefit in an inflationary environment. American Express makes most of its money through discount fees — merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills. Business is booming. In Q1, the company’s revenue jumped 29% year over year to $11.7 billion. American Express is the fifth-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire’s stake is worth nearly $24 billion. Berkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller. American Express shares currently offer a dividend yield of 1.3%. Coca-Cola is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable to most people. The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power. Add solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago. Buffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late ’80s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $25.8 billion. You can lock in a dividend yield of 2.7% on Coca-Cola's shares at current prices. No one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 13 Pro Max would call it a steal. But consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway. Earlier last year, management revealed that the company’s active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.65 billion devices, including over 1 billion iPhones. While competitors offer cheaper devices, many consumers don’t want to live outside the Apple ecosystem. That means, as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying too much about a drop in sales volume. Today, Apple is Buffett’s largest publicly traded holding, representing nearly 40% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value. Of course, the sheer increase in Apple’s stock price is one of the reasons for that concentration. Over the past five years, shares of the tech gorilla have surged more than 280%. Apple currently offers a dividend yield of 0.6%. One of Buffett’s big moves in 2022 is loading up on Chevron. According to an SEC filing, Berkshire owned $25.9 billion of the energy giant as of Mar. 31 — a significant jump from its stake of $4.5 billion at the end of 2021. Today, Chevron represents the third-largest public holding at Berkshire. It’s not difficult to understand why. Even though the oil business is capital intensive, it tends to do very well during periods of high inflation. Oil — the most heavily traded commodity globally — has soared 45% year to date. And the supply shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could keep that trend going. Strong oil prices benefit oil producers. Chevron’s latest quarterly earnings more than quadrupled year over year. The stock is up nearly 40% in 2022. The company returns cash to investors, too. Paying quarterly dividends of $1.42 per share, Chevron has an annual yield of 3.4%. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.

What that (response) will be - we will see what threats are created for us."" The comments appeared to mark a major shift in rhetoric. Moscow for decades has cast NATO expansion as a direct threat to Russia's security, including citing it as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine itself. Russia's invasion has shaken up Europe's security architecture and forced Sweden and Finland to choose sides after staying out of NATO during the Cold War. Finland and Sweden now say they want the protection offered by NATO's treaty, under which an attack on any member is an attack on all. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson made the announcement Monday. ""Our 200-year-long standing policy of military non-alignment has served Sweden well but the issue at hand is whether military non-alignment will keep serving us well. And Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is not only illegal and indefensible, it also undermines the European security order that Sweden builds its security on."" Swedish and Finnish officials have said Putin has only himself to blame for their decisions to join NATO. But the plans might be hitting a snag. NATO member Turkey said it would not approve either bid, with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan saying Monday that Sweden and Finland should not bother sending delegations to Ankara to persuade Turkey.

He identifies himself as a white supremacist. Witnesses said Gendron wore camouflage and looked like he was “in the army.” Reports show he was clad in body armor. The shooter broadcast the onslaught on Twitch, a live-streaming platform. Eleven of the victims were Black, and two were white. “It was straight-up, racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community, outside of the city of good neighbors, as the mayor said, coming into our community and trying to inflict that evil upon us,” Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said in a press briefing. Gendron pleaded not guilty to first-degree felony charges Saturday night. Erie County District Attorney John J. Flynn said it is the highest murder charge in the state. Flynn said he pushed for the suspect to be arraigned Saturday night.

So I assure everyone in this community, justice is being done right now, and justice will be done,” Flynn said during a briefing. Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said Gendron drove hours away from his home in Broome County, New York — more than 200 miles from Buffalo — to commit the crime. He killed three people in the store’s parking lot before exchanging gunfire with a security guard inside, killing the retired police officer. Six of the people Gendron killed were customers, and four were employees. The assailant later surrendered to police after he “put the gun to his own neck,” according to reports. “It’s like walking onto a horror movie, but everything is real. It is Armageddon-like,” a police official at the scene told Buffalo News. “It is so overwhelming.” Katherine Crofton told reporters she saw the suspect shoot a woman going into the store and another putting away groceries. A dairy worker, Will G., told the Buffalo News he heard shots while restocking milk. He and others hid in the cooler. However, some who hid near cash registers did not escape the killer’s deadly ammo, reports show. Others jetted outside and around the store to search for their loved ones and co-workers in the chaos. “I just heard shots. Shots and shots and shots,” Will G. said. “It sounded like things were falling over.” Witnesses said the suspect initially ignored officers’ commands “like he wanted them to shoot him” before they took him down. Gendron faces life without parole for the state felony murder charge. The judge Saturday ordered a forensic examination, and the suspect must return to court in five days for a felony hearing. Media allowed to record, but no live stream.

Investigators are reportedly combing through a 106-page manifesto connected to the shooting that shows admiration for South Carolina church shooter Dylann Roof and the New Zealand mosque shooter Brenton Tarrant, ABC News reports. According to reports, Gendron’s online manifesto shows he developed racist views in recent years, which grew more radical over the past three. Gendron had been “passively preparing” for the massacre for several years, The New York Times reports. He stocked up ammunition and protective gear and occasionally held target practice. In May 2020, Gendron started following anonymous chatter on “white replacement theory.” “If there’s one thing I want you to get from these writings, it’s that White birth rates must change. Everyday the White population becomes fewer in number,” the manifesto reportedly says. “To maintain a population the people must achieve a birth rate that reaches replacement fertility levels, in the western world that is about 2.06 births per woman.” Gendron also created a timeline for the attack, including a layout of the store. The self-proclaimed white supremacist mapped out his parking space, selected his meal beforehand and picked the spot where he would start the live stream. He wrote down his plan to kill the security guard and shoot Black shoppers twice in the chest if he could, reports show. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul slammed Twitch and social medial companies for not taking action against hate speech on their platforms, demanding they be held accountable for allowing “this hate to be spewed and others who are like-minded to be radicalized.” “A community was shattered by an individual, a white supremacist, who has engaged in an act of terrorism and will be prosecuted as such in a cold-hearted, calculated way, a military-style execution targeting people who simply want to buy groceries in a neighborhood store,” Hochul said during a briefing.

5/17/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -Russia has probably lost around a third of the ground forces it deployed to Ukraine and its offensive in the Donbas region ""has lost momentum and fallen significantly behind schedule"", British military intelligence said on Sunday. ""Despite small-scale initial advances, Russia has failed to achieve substantial territorial gains over the past month whilst sustaining consistently high levels of attrition,"" the British defence ministry said on Twitter. ""Russia has now likely suffered losses of one third of the ground combat force it committed in February."" It said Russia was unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days. Since Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, Ukraine's military has forced Russia's commanders to abandon an advance on the capital Kyiv, before making rapid gains in the northeast and driving them away from the second biggest city of Kharkiv. A Ukrainian counteroffensive has been under way near the Russian-held town of Izium, though Ukraine's military reported on Sunday that Russian forces were advancing elsewhere in the Donbas region, the main theatre of war over the past month.
