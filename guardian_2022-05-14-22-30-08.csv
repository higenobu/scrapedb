5/14/2022,"Jemma Melvin, the winner of the competition to find a pudding to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee, has called her lemon swiss roll and amaretti trifle a “humble” dish. But as I stand in my kitchen in the early morning light, wearily contemplating her recipe, it seems anything but modest. For starters, there’s its size. “Serves 20,” I read. Should I swap my glass bowl for a bucket? It’s also ridiculously complicated, requiring the cook to make not only jelly and custard but also swiss rolls, lemon curd, amaretti biscuits, a “chunky” mandarin coulis and jewelled white chocolate “bark”. Melvin insists that it’s fine to cheat. Buy a jar of lemon curd, a box of Italian biscuits and a tub of ready-made custard, she urges nervous cooks. To do this, however, would render the whole exercise pointless, wouldn’t it? You might as well buy a Colin the Caterpillar cake from M&S and have done with it. I begin at 9am, just as the pips sound on Radio 4. Swiss roll? This, at least, I can do. Alas, I have no baking parchment – to be more accurate, the baking parchment has fallen down the back of the cupboard and cannot be retrieved except by drone – so I lightly oil some greaseproof paper and line a tin with this instead. Then I beat the eggs and sugar, add the self-raising flour and stick it in the oven. While it’s baking, I make the lemon curd, something else I can do in my sleep (my star dish is meringue with lemon curd). In this case, the curd is the swiss roll’s filling, and if you’ve never made one before, honestly, it’s easy: you just warm the egg yolks, sugar, butter and lemon juice in a bain marie and stir until it thickens. By 10 o’clock, then, I’ve got some lovely, sticky slices of Swiss roll with which to line the bottom of my bowl, as instructed. There are gaps, which makes me nervous. Melvin is opposed to gaps. But when I press on the sponge with my hands, they disappear, no harm done. Next, the St Clement’s jelly. I toy with using orange Chivers, a packet of which I unaccountably find in my pantry. In the end I go for it, making it properly with gelatine leaves and a combination of orange and lemon juice. Once it’s cool, I pour it over the swiss roll and leave it to set, which will take about three hours, during which time I can make the coulis and the bark. The coulis deploys tinned mandarin oranges, which, for good reasons, I haven’t eaten since I was at school (I once tipped a disastrously sloppy chocolate pudding I’d decorated with tinned mandarins and Dream Topping in a home economics lesson all over a man on the top deck of my bus home). You thicken it with arrowroot, an ingredient that the recipe – warning: it’s badly written and not quite accurate – springs on you unexpectedly; I had to use cornflour instead. The white chocolate for the “bark” must be melted and spread over a baking tray. You then dot it with mixed peel and stick it in the fridge until it hardens. At 3 o’clock it’s time to put the whole thing together. It goes like this. First, cover the jelly with custard, and the custard with a layer of amaretti biscuits (I do cheat now, because life is too short to make amaretti biscuits). Next, add the coulis, followed by a layer of whipped cream, and finally the bark, which is broken into shards and arranged on top. This last flourish is, I think, a bad example of lily-gilding. Standing in the cream, the chocolate soon begins to droop, and I know without even tasting it that it won’t stand up to the citrus flavours. The finished pudding looks – am I allowed to say this? – quite magnificent: the layers are distinct; I’ve avoided the dreaded seepage. But when I serve it, the reviews are mixed. We think it’s a bit boring and too sweet. The recipe was inspired by the lemon posset that was served at the Queen’s wedding breakfast, but possets are much easier to make and so much more tangy and sharp than this trifle. It wants for a kick. Maybe the sponge should be soaked in limoncello? And what a faff! The work-pleasure ratio is all out of kilter here. The organisers of the competition – Fortnum & Mason is the prime mover – believe that, like the great Constance Spry’s coronation chicken before it, Melvin’s trifle will have staying power, that we’ll be making it for decades to come. But I’m not so sure. How is it any better than a sherry trifle, made with tipsy stale sponge and raspberry jam? The durability of coronation chicken lies not only in its sheer deliciousness but in its simplicity: the sauce is made with a very basic wine reduction, curry powder, apricots and some mayonnaise, nothing more. But Mary Berry, Monica Galetti and all the other competition judges are right about one thing. Last Thursday, shortly before the Duchess of Cornwall announced the winner on BBC One, a food historian called Regula Ysewijn, who was dressed for the Blitz, reminded viewers that our story is written in our food; that each decade comes with its defining dishes, and that these may tell us more about ourselves than we imagine, not all of it good. Coronation chicken was born in extreme austerity. In 1953, wartime rationing had yet to end. Its flavour belies the relative ordinariness of its ingredients. To make Melvin’s trifle, on the other hand, you will need more than a kilogram of sugar, 13 eggs and a litre of double cream. I don’t want to be a total killjoy. I know it’s for a special occasion. But this is a pudding, outrageously sweet and slightly insipid, for a nation that may have lost sight of what the word treat really means.",News/UK news,"Queen’s platinum jubilee pudding is absurdly complicated.

5/14/2022,"For nearly the entirety of his two-decade career, Rafael Nadal has been a picture of calm on the tennis court. Nobody has endured as many moments of abject tension in the final rounds of the biggest tournaments yet navigated them while betraying so few negative emotions, shrugging off mistakes and despair, remaining steadfastly positive. But on Thursday night in Rome, for once his emotions were written all over his face. As he limped and grimaced around the court, barely able to run during his loss to Denis Shapovalov, he continually looked up at his team in the stands. He shook his head, he cursed his bad luck and he spent moments at the change of ends with his head buried in his hands. The source of Nadal’s frustration was one of the most familiar sensations he has experienced in his career. Eighteen years ago, as he contested his first full season on the tour as a 17-year-old, Nadal suffered from a stress fracture in his foot. The injury would reveal Müller-Weiss disease, a degenerative foot injury that weakens the navicular bone in the foot. Unhelpfully for an athlete in an 11-month season, it worsens with physical exercise. Over the years, Nadal has had to invest significant time, effort and anti-inflammatories into managing it. Its effect on his career has sometimes been underreported but it has left a continuous, visible mark. It was the reason why he spent six months out last year and retirement skipped across his mind, and it is unmistakable in the limp that sometimes accompanies him in press conferences and around the grounds. Everyone is dealing with something. Injuries are a common facet of sport, a natural result of athletes pushing their bodies past limits that few bodies are truly built to withstand. Tennis players have an even more complex relationship with them. While athletes are constantly determined to play through injuries at all costs, in team sports it is up to the coaches to limit their players’ load and conserve their bodies, even against their will. In an individual sport such as tennis, players are fully in charge of their schedules, which is not always a good thing. It is hard not to think of the ordeal that Andy Murray has gone through in order to maintain his career as connected to the monstrous effort it took for him to remain close enough to Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. All of those extra tournaments contested and training sessions endured so that he could finally pounce and become the best player in the world. Likewise, Dominic Thiem spent his youth renowned for playing in a tournament almost every week. After finally fulfilling one of his lifetime goals by winning the US Open in 2020, last year Thiem suffered from mental burnout and now he is attempting to return after his body followed suit. Emma Raducanu’s adaptation to life on the tour continues and her body so far has rebelled against it. After another injury led to her retirement this week in Rome, she was openly contemplating how frequently she should play. “Of course I want to play every opportunity I have, and probably even when I shouldn’t,” she said. “But I just really need to be sensible. Sometimes I feel like I need a voice to just hold my hand: ‘Do this, do that.’” Such issues have been present for Nadal in a career that has been framed by injuries. He has missed 11 grand slam tournaments since his Wimbledon debut in 2003 and so many other tournaments have ended with him losing his battle with his body. His career has seemed to exist in a perpetual cycle of these moments, each new run of form and fresh period of reinvention inevitably coming to a crashing halt with another injury. This time part of the frustration is that it is not a typical injury with a set period of recovery, which is frustrating but endurable. It is completely inconsistent; at times the foot is comfortable, at other times it is unbearable. It seems increasingly clear that, as his career advances, it could play a significant role in how long he has left. “I imagine that there will come a time when my head says: ‘Enough,’” said Nadal. “Pain takes away your happiness, not only in tennis but in life. My problem is that I live many days with too much pain.” One of the great marks of Nadal’s career is the success he has still found and the longevity he has achieved through all of the misfortune. This season alone, as he turns 36 next month, he engineered his greatest start to a season by winning his first 20 matches. He now faces a race to be fit for the French Open next Sunday, where he is aiming for his 14th title. After so many years and so much wear, it seems the best he can hope for nowadays is that a new cycle begins.",Sport/Sport,Familiar injuries raise painful prospect that end is near for Nadal | Tumaini Carayol,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/14/familiar-injuries-raise-painful-prospect-that-end-is-near-for-rafael-nadal-tennis
5/14/2022,"Hayden Anhedönia’s Ethel Cain alter ego came about as an escape from a particularly tortured teenhood. Raised in a strict and oppressive Southern Baptist community in Florida, and then at 16 coming out as gay, and later a trans woman, Anhedönia found release by imagining life as a superstar diva. Explaining to Pitchfork how she became Cain, she says: “That fanatical delusion was definitely the stepping stone and I’m just stubborn enough to have actually tried to make it happen.” Anhedönia has released a string of increasingly impressive singles in recent years, including the dream-pop haze of Gibson Girl and the brilliantly noirish Lana Del Rey-isms of Crush. Her debut album, Preacher’s Daughter, released this month, is her boldest statement yet, taking in elements of alt-rock, gospel, pop (most notably on the standout American Teenager) and country, all refracted through a southern gothic prism, with recurring themes of small-town ennui, toxic relationships and death. Now living in a deconsecrated church in rural Indiana, it’s clear that Anhedönia’s Baptist upbringing still casts a long shadow. “I have a weird relationship with putting religion in my art,” she says. “I’m so far removed from it now, but considering that’s really all I knew for my whole life, it’s definitely the main source of inspiration.” Preacher’s Daughter is out now",Arts/Music,One to watch: Ethel Cain,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/14/one-to-watch-ethel-cain-preachers-daughter
5/14/2022,"Antisocial work hours, long days on your feet, and dealing with impatient and sometimes unpleasant passengers. Such is the life of an airport security officer. Their role is to check passengers and their luggage before boarding, and they are key to ensuring safety and the smooth running of an airport. But the work is not well paid, and airports are struggling to recruit enough people to staff the X-ray machines and metal detectors as air travel rebounds after Covid. As airports get busier and the queues to get through security get longer, those on the frontline are under stress. Now a security officer who has worked for several years in the terminal at Stansted airport, located north-east of London, has come forward to share the behind-the-scenes realities of the job. The Guardian is protecting his identity because this is his only employment. He currently works two long shifts a week, mostly at the weekends, with very early starts to manage the morning peak departure times. “They can’t seem to keep people. But it is difficult work. Generally we start work at 4am, so getting up at 2am to get yourself into work is a killer. Of course you have to go to sleep early, so it kills any life really,” the man, who is in his 50s, told the Guardian. He earns £14 an hour and takes home about £1,200 a month. Working in a team, a group of colleagues are based around an X-ray machine. Passengers are greeted and then asked to take their belongings out of their pockets, to put them and their bags into a plastic tray to be screened. The passengers pass through a metal detector and if required, they are searched. Each security officer is only allowed to sit at the X-ray machine, monitoring the screen for a maximum of 20 minutes. Yet this is often the only time during their shift that a security officer is able to sit down, bar brief tea breaks. “The issue we have is lack of staff,” he said. “The last couple of times I have been in, we’ve got to the end of our shift and there has been no one to take over from us. We’ve had to close the doors to the lane and just walk away.” “It was particularly bad a couple of weeks ago. We left the machine full of bags, loads of people queueing to get in, we had to just shut the machine and walk away from it,” he said, adding that managers had to scramble to find workers to take over. The security officer believes a current lack of staff prevents Stansted from opening up enough security lanes, leading to long queues, or “snakes” of passengers, and more people missing their flights. “When the machine is full up with trays that need to be searched, the machine stops, and no one goes through, which stops the whole procedure and the snakes get incredibly long. You can hear people calling out from the lanes; they are missing their flight. Passengers are quite often in tears, which isn’t nice.” About half of the terminal security officers at Stansted took voluntary redundancy during the pandemic, as part of plans by the airport’s owner, Manchester Airports Group, to reduce its costs while planes remained grounded by Covid travel restrictions. The group is planning to hire about 300 people to fill vacancies, with ads for new recruits on the London underground, urging them to “Make an impact on countless passengers”, while promising that all training is included and no experience is required. Among the incentives designed to appeal to prospective workers is an 80% discount on bus and train travel to the airport, as well as a free bus from north London for employees starting work before public transport begins. A spokesperson for London Stansted said the airport had received an “excellent” response to its recruitment drive, with many applicants already going through vetting and training. They said the airport was “confident we will have the terminal security officers we require to run a full flight schedule this summer.” The security officer believes he and his colleagues would feel more valued if they earned more for carrying out their important work. “They could fill all the jobs tomorrow if they paid people more money. It all comes down to the fact they won’t pay more wages. They have decided it is a low-paid job,” he said. “If I could, I would leave tomorrow.”",News/Business,‘The job kills any life really’: secrets of a UK airport security officer,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/14/uk-airport-security-officer-stansted-staff
5/14/2022,"I’m surprised I’m not dead. I’ve hedged my bets with all the scrapes, skirmishes and disasters, but I do believe in corny, happy Hollywood endings. I’m not a good guy, but I’m not evil. I was quite swotty at school. Only a few of us went on to sixth form. I’d get the key to this secret place – the library – and sneak in at lunchtime. I wish I’d gone to university, but that was about the time I discovered the Smiths. We were a tight family unit, bouncing between barracks in Rhineland, Krefeld, Düsseldorf, Ilford and Dorset. There were only about six of us army kids in the same class aged between six and 12 in the same class, so we roamed freely with a Gerald Durrell vision of childhood – frogspawn, snake hunting. It was like Lord of the Flies. If I see a busker, I can’t not stop. If they’ve got some good ideas, I’ll say: “Show me that.” Then I might say: “Can I do a song?” Prison is really boring. There’s nothing to do but smoke and scowl. I’d get excited when they showed The Simpsons at 6pm. My cellmate would say: “What are you watching this for? It’s shit,” and I’d say: “No, it’s subversive and interesting.” I’m open-minded to see if I can have a positive effect on my destiny. When I was flapping about in the tabloids, my two security guards took me from Heathrow – a hand under each armpit – to projectile vomit with the Thai monks at Tham Krabok. You swallow a bucket of water, take this mixture of bark, berries and mud and release your demons as you vomit. You’re supposed to do it three times and vow to the gods that you will never take drugs again upon pain of death, but I escaped through the jungle. I’ve got chunks missing all over the place. I was swinging at the paparazzi in Italy – the guy took his camera, had me by the throat and bit off part of my earlobe. Someone else bit off part of my other earlobe in a pub in Stoke. I think he just wanted a souvenir. My dogs are my salvation. I was up at 6am and have been out twice this morning. Striding through the forest and fields is therapeutic. I keep Zeus on a lead – he’s not popular with the cats – but Gladys only chases wild pigs and deer and can’t catch them. I have the most glorious hats, but I don’t know where they go. Even round the house, my hats disappear. I think my dogs must have a bellyful of them. I’ve managed to get out of the addictive cycle – which I maintained all along I was quite happy in – but I was pretty fucked, and I’ve never really admitted to that. I’ve entered a phase of rejuvenation. Marriage is the bolster; I have the love and support of someone I love. I’m blessed to be alive, not sat in a hedge in Old Street, injecting into my groin.

5/14/2022,"Looks like the British Bung Company is in a spot of bother. An employment tribunal recently ruled that the West Yorkshire-based manufacturer of cask closures must compensate Tony Finn, a former employee, after he was called a “bald cunt” at work by a (male) supervisor. This was not just a nasty insult, according to the all-male panel of judges on the tribunal – the word “bald” constituted sex-based harassment. The word “cunt” was fine though. The circumstances are as follows: Finn had worked for the British Bung Company for almost 24 years when he was fired last May. The electrician then took the company to the tribunal alleging unfair dismissal and claiming that the insults his supervisor had subjected him to were harassment related to sex under the Equality Act. The panel, led by Judge Jonathan Brain, agreed. “As all three members of the tribunal will vouchsafe, baldness is much more prevalent in men than women,” the judgment stated. “We find it to be inherently related to sex.” Don’t worry, the judges didn’t just draw on their own experiences with hair loss as they ruled, they also referred to precedent. Namely a 1995 ruling in which a man was found guilty of sex-based discrimination for commenting on the size of a woman’s breasts (the remark was “hiya big tits”). That’s pretty much the same as calling a man “bald”, apparently. I have every sympathy for Finn: being bullied at work is indefensible. Belittling someone for their appearance is indefensible. I’m glad this tribunal took Finn’s complaints seriously. However, the idea that calling a man “bald” constitutes sex-based harassment that is equivalent to commenting on the size of a woman’s breasts is dubious at best and insulting at worst. Let’s start with the questionable claim that baldness is “inherently related to sex”. I’m sure Judge Brain has a fine legal mind but he might want to read up a bit more on hair loss. According to the American Hair Loss Association, “while 85% of men will experience visible hair loss by the age of 50, so will 40% of women”. Baldness might be more common in men but it’s not exactly rare for women; indeed a number of high-profile women have spoken out in recent years about their struggles with hair loss. These include Jada Pinkett Smith, who was memorably mocked by Chris Rock for being bald at the Oscars. Again, I have every sympathy for Finn. But, I’ve got to say, it’s pretty galling to see an all-male panel fall over themselves with compassion for a guy being called “bald” at work when women still have an extremely hard time getting claims of sexual harassment taken seriously. “It’s just a bit of banter,” women are constantly told when we complain about pervasive harassment. “Lighten up! Grow a thick skin! Don’t be so damn sensitive! Can’t you take a joke?” It’s hard not to see this case as emblematic of the double standards women are expected to tolerate. Experts are worried that “personhood” laws, which give rights to fertilized eggs, would make it illegal for fertility facilities to freeze or discard embryos created in the IVF process and make accessing the treatment much harder. That’s “pro-life” logic for you! Force women to give birth against their will, but prevent them from trying to get pregnant when they desperately want to. Again, very pro-life! I’ll be honest, writing this week’s newsletter is tough because I’m still reeling from the murder of the brilliant Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. According to multiple eyewitnesses, Abu Akleh was shot in the head by Israeli forces while covering Israeli army raids in the city of Jenin in the northern occupied West Bank. Rather than reporting eyewitness accounts, however, a number of western media outlets acted as if Abu Akleh had died in mysterious circumstances during “clashes”. Then, to make a terrible situation even worse, mourners at Abu Akleh’s funeral were violently attacked by Israeli police. Again the media threw around the word “clashes” and ignored very clear power imbalances. As a Palestinian you get used to being dehumanized by the media but Abu Akleh’s death has been a heartbreaking reminder that Palestinian lives really don’t matter. According to the Spanish Gynaecological and Obstetric Society, a third of women experience painful menstruation. “When there’s a problem that can’t be solved medically, we think it’s very sensible to have temporary sick leave,” Ángela Rodríguez, the secretary of state for equality, told El Periódico in March. Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Zambia already offer menstrual leave. Who hasn’t conducted widespread violations of human rights and butchered a journalist with a bone saw, eh? The good news is that there’s no problem a bit of sportswashing can’t fix. Perhaps they could all compromise and get a dog. “Not often that a robot centipede crawls out of my vagina,” Madonna said. “I’m doing what women have been doing since the beginning of time, which is giving birth. But on a more existential level, I’m giving birth to art and creativity and we would be lost without both.” On an existential level, I’m exhausted. “The scientific names of nearly 3,000 recently identified bloodsuckers, hijackers and other banes of the biological world mostly honor men,” according to a new study. Science reports that “of the 596 parasite species honoring an eminent scientist, only 18% immortalized women researchers”. While it may reflect societal biases I can’t say I’m entirely devastated by the fact more parasitic tapeworms aren’t named after women. Perhaps you think the future looks bleak? Perhaps you think we are nearing climate apocalypse and we’re all doomed? Well, cheer up my friends: Toyota has patented a robotic platform that can walk your dog and pick up its poop. There’s even a mode where your dog can drive the device using paw sensors. Self-driving dog cars, eh?

5/14/2022,"Clad in a stripy Technicolor dream jacket redolent of Joseph, Michael Kiwanuka shuffles on stage, buffeted by the celestial oohings of his backing singers. “To begin again,” he breathes on Piano Joint (This Kind of Love), “maybe win again.” The colourful stripes are the loudest thing about Kiwanuka or, indeed, much of this gig; the prospect of his victory sounds tentative rather than certain. This is a long-awaited show by one of Britain’s least showy stars, a soul man of international renown, whose downplaying of everything has been his strongest suit, beginning again. Of all the tours put on ice for the pandemic, this one feels like it’s had the most protracted of spells in limbo. Released in November 2019, the singer-songwriter’s Kiwanuka album won the Mercury prize in 2020 for its portrait of a wistful and frustrated artist finally coming home to himself, set against a backdrop of lush orchestrations with the shootings of young black men in the US baked into the percussion. (It was also nominated for a Grammy.) In early 2020, with a tour of the album just beginning, Kiwanuka contracted laryngitis. By the time he was better, the world had stopped. The 2021 Kiwanuka tour reboot was again pushed back, to 2022. (Stormzy’s Heavy Is the Head has had a similar stop-start trajectory, but was released a month later and its tour wrapped more than a month ago.) In the background, the wheel of life ground resonantly on. Kiwanuka featured the sampled words of John Lewis, the civil rights leader and US congressman. Crackly recordings explained the non-violent sit-ins activists conducted in the 60s in then segregated diners, with Lewis highlighting the imperative to “keep loving” those who refused him service. Lewis’s death in July 2020 was especially painful in the context of the new civil rights struggle unfolding in tandem with Covid. There were births as well as deaths. Kiwanuka confirmed another star: producer Inflo, who later released a succession of exquisitely tooled protest records as Sault and produced albums by Little Simz, his close associate Cleo Sol and, latterly, several tracks of Adele’s 30. Listening again to Kiwanuka, you can hear the series of Sault signatures in embryo in the arrangements, interludes and segues. Choirs gust in, string sections swoon, the ghost of composer and arranger David Axelrod flaps about. It would be incorrect to credit the elegiac set-dressing up to Inflo alone: US super-producer Danger Mouse worked in tandem with Inflo, Kiwanuka and the Bees’ Paul Butler to create a sound world steeped in period warmth, whose depth of field is one of its strongest suits. Going to a gig in the expectation that it will sound like the record has usually been a fool’s errand. But Kiwanuka and his six-strong band deliver a set so classy and all-enveloping it is almost amniotic, complete with interludes, pregnant pauses and passages when the band just lock into a kind of rapt collective Kiwanuka dream state. The lights, arranged in a series of curves and arches, suggest a gently dazzling series of cocoons; everything looks, sounds and feels a faded sort of burnt-umber-going-on-tan. For the most part, Kiwanuka and his tight, nimble band are backlit in the haze of the smoke machine, standing in for all those period-perfect carcinogens. Naturally, he plays the hits from his other two albums. There’s a lively clap-along for his best-known calling card, Black Man in a White World, from 2016’s Love & Hate, an album that prefigured the African-inspired cover art and the “I won’t change my name” vibes of Kiwanuka, in which this Londoner of Ugandan origin embraced his background and his out-of-time musical tastes. There are hoots of recognition too for the song that first put Kiwanuka on the map, the bruised folk-soul of Home Again, from 2012. But the focus remains on the expertly recreated sound of Kiwanuka, with the ersatz strings and horns marshalled by keyboard player Steve Pringle sufficiently dramatic to pass muster. Solid Ground begins as a series of oscillations and a Lewis sample; Kiwanuka accompanies himself on keys. Later, his vocals and the synth strings answer each other and the band finally come in, Michael Jablonka’s electric guitar cutting through like an angry wasp. Jablonka never puts a finger wrong, trading solos elsewhere with Kiwanuka that pull off the difficult trick of recalling Jimi Hendrix while being studiedly unostentatious; his west African motifs are one of the best things about one of Kiwanuka’s greatest songs, You Ain’t the Problem. If you had to pick a bone, it would be that for all Kiwanuka’s extensive record collector tastes – his really early stuff sounds like Terry Callier – a few songs feel as if they are just a key change away from being Crazy by Gnarls Barkley (AKA Danger Mouse and Cee-Lo Green). At any second, it feels as if the stark acoustic start of Hero might morph into Hendrix’s All Along the Watchtower. But it never does. Instead, Kiwanuka’s warm and weary questioning powers up magnificently into a full-band crescendo – its suddenness and loudness landing an unexpectedly impactful blow in the context of a velvet glove of a gig.",Arts/Music,Michael Kiwanuka review – patience is golden,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/14/michael-kiwanuka-cambridge-corn-exchange-live-review
5/14/2022,"When JK Rowling wrote Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone she didn’t just bring the characters to life with words, she also drew illustrations. They were not included when the book was published, but now the author’s original drawings will appear alongside her story for the first time when the book is reprinted to mark its 25th anniversary. One sketch shows Rubeus Hagrid, Professor Albus Dumbledore and Professor Minerva McGonagall huddled together in a moonlit Privet Drive, while a small series of five drawings depicts Diagon Alley. All reveal Rowling’s early feeling for characters now familiar to children across the globe as the stars of a series that has sold more than 500m copies and been translated into 80 languages. The book is reissued next month as part of silver anniversary celebrations, complete this time not only with Rowling’s sketches from the early 1990s, but also with the famous cover drawn in 1996 by a debut designer, Thomas Taylor. “I’m often asked if I was paralysed by the pressure of producing the cover art for the very first edition,” Taylor, 48, says. “But that is because nowadays it’s hard to imagine a time when no one had heard of Harry Potter at all. I was a newly graduated art student back in 1996, and looking for my first break in illustration.” It had seemed like a good warm-up job for an aspiring young illustrator: create some artwork for a new children’s book about a schoolboy wizard. Twenty-five years on, and Taylor’s cover has become one of the most recognisable images in world literature. The new hardback will be on sale for a year, and includes an explanation of a mystery that has long baffled the most devoted readers. When Taylor was commissioned at the age of 23, he was asked to provide an extra image of a wizard for the back cover. Stumped for speedy inspiration, he writes, he drew a study of his own “magical” father, Robert, dressed in a pointy hat and smoking a large pipe. “‘Who is that?,’ readers wanted to know. ‘It’s not Dumbledore, it’s not Quirrell and it’s not Snape’,” he writes. The pressure to solve the puzzle quickly became intense, with fans suggesting rival interpretations. “Was there some secret here? Was this a clue to something that would happen in later books? And what was that in the mysterious wizard’s coat pocket?” The questions kept coming, recalls Taylor. “Conspiracy theories began to grow, and the trickle of letters and emails to Bloomsbury became a torrent, until I was eventually asked to replace my father with a painting of Albus Dumbledore.” Speaking to the Observer, Taylor also resolved another prickly question that has stumped fans – what made the odd shape in the wizard’s deep coat pocket. “I thought it might well be a hedgehog,” he said. “It might be the sort of thing he would need. I wasn’t planning for it to become a huge thing that would follow me through my life, though. You expect your first job to be completely forgotten.” Taylor’s father died in 2020, and the original sketch was sold at auction after the films came out. “I thought all the old imagery would be replaced for good by film stills,” he said. “I am not sure who has it now.” This March, a perfectly intact first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone fetched £69,000 at auction. There were only 500 copies of the first print run in 1997, with about 300 going to libraries and schools and the remainder to bookshops. Crucial typographical errors mark them out, including the double appearance of a wand on the list of items required for pupils at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, on page 53. Taylor did not get his own first edition, but when he looks back with pride at the cover illustration, showing “The Boy Who Lived” with his lightning-bolt scar standing next to the Hogwarts Express on Platform Nine and Three-Quarters with his lightning bolt scar, he knows what changes he would make. “I would do it completely differently now,” he said. “Harry was about to get on the train at King’s Cross, so I felt he should just be in any old clothes. I would put him in something different now. And there may be too much of the station visible.” Taylor, now an established children’s author with his own series of books, the Eerie-on-Sea Mysteries, optioned for filming, admires Rowling’s images in this edition, which were first seen six years ago on the fan website Pottermore. “I love her drawings,” he said. “I really like it when a writer does their own pictures, and these are really charming. They should be in all the books, really.” Taylor got his break after he left a portfolio with sample images of wizards and dragons in Bloomsbury’s offices. The publisher phoned him at the children’s bookshop where he worked, and Barry Cunningham – the editor who rescued Rowling’s book from the pile of unsolicited manuscripts from aspiring writers – asked him to paint Harry approaching the Hogwarts Express. “There was some to-ing and fro-ing about how to draw Harry simultaneously approaching the train from the front, while not presenting the back of his head to the reader, and then I was given a printed manuscript to read on my own train journey home,” he remembers. As a result, Taylor was one of the first people to read the book. The anniversary hardback will be published by Bloomsbury Children’s Books on 9 June.",Arts/Books,Harry Potter and the secret sketches: JK Rowling’s first drawings of boy wizard,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/14/harry-potter-philosophers-stone-jk-rowling-sketches
5/14/2022,"Russian forces are withdrawing from the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have claimed, as the wives of soldiers trapped in the besieged port of Mariupol called on the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, to save them. The general staff of Ukraine’s army said on Saturday that after a bloody battle the Russians appeared to be departing their positions around Ukraine’s second biggest city, 31 miles (50km) from the Russian border. The remorseless shelling endured by the civilian population in the region was also said to have paused on Saturday, according to the regional governor, Oleh Sinegubov, while Ukrainian forces were launching a counteroffensive near the city of Izium, 78 miles south of Kharkiv. Ukraine’s head of military intelligence, Maj Gen Kyrylo Budanov, told Sky News he believed Russian advances would stall completely over the summer. He said: “The breaking point will be in the second part of August. Most of the active combat actions will have finished by the end of this year. As a result, we will renew Ukrainian power in all our territories that we have lost including Donbas and the Crimea.” Ukraine’s success in the north-east contrasted with the situation for the remaining soldiers trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in the south-eastern city of Mariupol, whose relatives have appealed to China to persuade Vladimir Putin to allow them safe passage out via Turkey. Speaking on Saturday at a press conference in Kyiv, Natalia Zarytska, the wife of Bogdan Sements, who is among those trapped in the sprawling steelworks, said: “Strong leaders cannot stand aside when there is evil. “After all these negotiations there is one person worldwide who it would be difficult for Vladimir Putin to refuse. We hope that strong and good China can make difficult decisions for the good. “We ask the esteemed premier of China, Xi Jinping, to express love and care for global values and eastern wisdom and to join the process of rescuing the defenders of Mariupol.” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said talks with Moscow on extracting a “large number” of wounded defenders and some medics out of the plant in Mariupol in return for the release of Russian prisoners of war were “very complex”, adding that Kyiv was using influential intermediaries. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk told local TV on Saturday that efforts were now focused on evacuating about 60 people. Sviatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment, which makes up most of the remaining forces at the plant, said on a YouTube video that his soldiers were holding on. He said: “Our enemy, supported by planes and artillery, continues to attack. They continue their assault on our positions but we continue to repel them.” The developments came as a joint statement from foreign ministers was issued by the world’s seven biggest economies, known as the G7, who said they would not recognise the borders Russia is trying to redraw. After three days of talks in northern Germany, the ministers from the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US warned they would expand sanctions on Russia that would cripple its economy.They said: “We will never recognise borders Russia has attempted to change by military aggression, and will uphold our engagement in the support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea, and all states. “We reaffirm our determination to further increase economic and political pressure on Russia, continuing to act in unity.” They warned the war in Ukraine was stoking a global food crisis and called for Moscow to unlock key ports and allow Ukrainian grain exports. They said: “Up to 50 million people, particularly in the countries of Africa and the Middle East, will die in the next few months … Russia’s war of aggression has generated one of the most severe food and energy crises in recent history, which now threatens those most vulnerable across the globe.” The G7 also called on China not to aid Vladimir Putin and “to desist from engaging in information manipulation, disinformation and other means to legitimise Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”. Three weeks before Putin launched his war in Ukraine, the Russian president signed a pact with his Chinese counterpart that said there would be “no limits” to the two countries’ cooperation.",News/World news,"Russian forces are withdrawing from Kharkiv, Ukraine says ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/ukraine-says-russian-forces-withdrawing-kharkiv
5/14/2022,"A dominoes player has won a court case over a ban against he and his friends playing the game “loudly” that he said was racially motivated. Ernest Theophile took Westminster city council to court after it granted an injunction banning social gatherings in Maida Hill Market Square in north-west London. Theophile and his friends have been gathering in the square for 12 years, to chat, socialise, and play dominoes, cards and backgammon. However, the council banned them from congregating there in January 2021, citing noise and antisocial behaviour problems. It said it had received more than 200 complaints. In March 2021, a judge changed the order meaning the group could return to the square near a junction between Harrow Road, Westbourne Park and Maida Vale. But the group could have been jailed if they were caught “playing loud amplified music, drinking alcohol, shouting or swearing”. However, the 74-year-old took the council to court, saying its order was racist as it discriminated against Caribbean culture. Theophile’s family arrived from the Dominican Republic in the 1950s as part of the Windrush generation. “If you are West Indian, you just can’t play dominoes without making a bit of noise,” Theophile said, adding that he had visited the area for most of his life and that it helped people avoid social isolation. On Friday, Judge Heather Baucher, presiding at central London county court, ruled that Westminster council was wrong to not take equality into consideration when taking out the injunction. She said its decision was “flawed” and “untenable”. Lawyers representing the council said that guidance saying equality matters must be taken into account was “seriously wrong” so officials did not have to follow it, which Baucher rejected. Theophile’s legal team will try to get the injunction thrown out in court next month. Theophile said: “The loneliness was one of the biggest factors as to why we gather there. That’s why the square [is] ideal for us. “Sometimes the younger generation come here and congregate, but we just want a place where we can socialise and play a few games to pass the time.” The Rev Henry Everett, the vicar of nearby St Peter’s church, said: “The borough of Westminster has some of the most deprived areas in London. Around the Harrow Road, I have found there to be an astonishing level of need in the community in terms of mental health support, so I was shocked when I heard about the injunction and I expressed serious concerns about the use of this dangerous, catch-all measure against the whole community.” Theophile’s lawyer, Anne McMurdie, said: “There has been a complete failure by Westminster city council to recognise and comply with the equalities obligations owed to the West Indian community. Instead, the council rushed to draconian measures by seeking an injunction backed up by a power of arrest, which could have seen my client sent to prison.” A spokesperson for Westminster city council said its new Labour administration hoped to find a solution: “We recognise and accept the judgment of the high court. “This is the first time that we have been asked to apply equalities law when applying for an injunction, which is why we had previously not sought one. “We maintain and continue to believe that our actions have always been in the best interests of local residents, who have been plagued by antisocial behaviour and criminality. “However, the council is reviewing its approach to this case with the new administration looking to find a solution that works for the whole community.”",News/UK news,Dominoes player wins case over ‘racist’ noise ban in London square,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/14/dominoes-player-wins-case-over-racist-noise-ban-in-london-square
