5/18/2022,"The market doesn’t seem able to find a bottom. The S&P 500 has fallen about 16% year to date, while the tech-centric Nasdaq is down 26% over the same time frame. But CNBC’s Jim Cramer sees plenty of opportunity amid the market downturn. In fact, the Mad Money host recently revealed two stocks that he wants to buy right now. Here’s a quick look at each one of them. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Cramer has been a fan of Apple for years. He says that he’s been ‘long’ on the company ever since his daughter owned a blue and a pink iPod. And due to the recent drop in Apple’s share price — the tech giant is down 20% year to date — Cramer thinks it's time to hit the buy button once again. “I want to buy it. I upgraded for the charitable trust. It’s been straight down,” he says. In the latest earnings conference call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company hasn’t been immune to supply chain disruptions. CFO Luca Maestri added that supply constraints — resulting from COVID-related disruptions and silicon shortages — could impact sales by $4 billion to $8 billion. That said, Cramer thinks the iPhone maker will be fine, citing his recent interview with Micron Technology CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. “He said phones are good,” Cramer recalls. “Higher-end phones? Good.” In the most recent quarter, iPhone sales grew 5.5% year over year to $50.6 billion and accounted for 52% of Apple’s total sales. As a leading manufacturer of graphics cards, Nvidia shares have had a solid bull run over the past decade. But that rally came to an abrupt end in November 2021. Since reaching a peak of $346 in late November, the stock has fallen about 50%. Nvidia’s plunge is substantial even when compared to other beaten-down stocks in the semiconductor sector. And Cramer has taken notice. “Nvidia has been cut in half,” he says on CNBC. “It’s the worst chart I’ve seen. Honestly, it’s so horrible that I want to buy it.” Nvidia’s business is performing well, making it a particularly intriguing contrarian idea. The chipmaker generated $7.64 billion of revenue in its fiscal Q4. The amount not only represented a 53% increase year over year, but also a new quarterly record. Revenue from gaming — Nvidia’s largest segment — increased 37% year over year to a record $3.42 billion. Meanwhile, data center — the company’s second-largest segment — saw revenue spike 71% to a record $3.26 billion. Nvidia is scheduled to report Q1 FY23 results on May 25 after the closing bell.

5/18/2022,"Price levels continue to rise at a rate we haven’t seen in decades. In April, U.S. consumer prices surged 8.3% — down slightly from 8.5% in March, but still near 40-year highs. Spiking inflation has severe consequences for your cash savings. Fortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has plenty of advice on what to own when consumer prices spike. In a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two business traits that investors should look for when trying to fight inflation: 1) the power to increase prices easily, and 2) the ability to take on more business without having to spend excessively. Here are four Berkshire holdings that largely boast those characteristics. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Last year, American Express demonstrated its pricing power as it raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card from $550 to $695. The company also stands to directly benefit in an inflationary environment. American Express makes most of its money through discount fees — merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills. Business is booming. In Q1, the company’s revenue jumped 29% year over year to $11.7 billion. American Express is the fifth-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire’s stake is worth nearly $24 billion. Berkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller. American Express shares currently offer a dividend yield of 1.3%. Coca-Cola is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable to most people. The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power. Add solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago. Buffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late ’80s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $25.8 billion. You can lock in a dividend yield of 2.7% on Coca-Cola's shares at current prices. No one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 13 Pro Max would call it a steal. But consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway. Earlier last year, management revealed that the company’s active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.65 billion devices, including over 1 billion iPhones. While competitors offer cheaper devices, many consumers don’t want to live outside the Apple ecosystem. That means, as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying too much about a drop in sales volume. Today, Apple is Buffett’s largest publicly traded holding, representing nearly 40% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value. Of course, the sheer increase in Apple’s stock price is one of the reasons for that concentration. Over the past five years, shares of the tech gorilla have surged more than 280%. Apple currently offers a dividend yield of 0.6%. One of Buffett’s big moves in 2022 is loading up on Chevron. According to an SEC filing, Berkshire owned $25.9 billion of the energy giant as of Mar. 31 — a significant jump from its stake of $4.5 billion at the end of 2021. Today, Chevron represents the third-largest public holding at Berkshire. It’s not difficult to understand why. Even though the oil business is capital intensive, it tends to do very well during periods of high inflation. Oil — the most heavily traded commodity globally — has soared 45% year to date. And the supply shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could keep that trend going. Strong oil prices benefit oil producers. Chevron’s latest quarterly earnings more than quadrupled year over year. The stock is up nearly 40% in 2022. The company returns cash to investors, too. Paying quarterly dividends of $1.42 per share, Chevron has an annual yield of 3.4%. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.

5/18/2022,"Keeping up the returns would be a neat trick in today’s market, as the main indexes are all steeply down for the year so far – with losses of 15% on the S&P 500 and 24% on the NASDAQ. For investors, then, the best strategy may just be to follow a winner. Billionaire investing legend George Soros is most definitely a winner. He’s built a portfolio worth billions, and had possibly the greatest bull run in hedge fund history, averaging 30% annualized returns for 30 years. Starting in 1992, when he shorted the Pound Sterling and made $1 billion in 24 hours, to his most recent 13F filings, Soros has a record of success that few investors can match. Today, Soros remains the chair of Soros Fund Management and is thought to be worth over $8 billion, a figure which would have been far greater but for the billionaire’s extensive philanthropic work. So, when Soros takes out new positions for his stock portfolio, it is only natural for investors to sit up and take notice. With this in mind, we decided to take a look at three stocks his fund has recently loaded up on. Soros is not the only one showing confidence in these names; according to the TipRanks database, Wall Street’s analysts rate all three as Strong Buys and see plenty of upside on the horizon too. Stem, Inc. (STEM) First up is Stem, a tech company that specializes in using artificial intelligence (AI) to create ‘smart’ storage systems for clean energy. In other words, that company is designing thinking batteries that are optimized for use with renewable energy production schemes. Energy storage is a major bottleneck when it comes to renewables; as we all know, you cannot power the grid with wind or solar if the breezes die down or night falls. Smart batteries will let producers squeeze higher efficiencies from optimal generation times. The company’s main product is the Athena software platform, that uses a combination of AI and machine learning to optimize the switches between grid power, on-site generated power, and battery power. The customer base includes public utilities, major corporations, and various project developers and installers. Stem estimates that its total addressable market will increase 25x by the year 2050, to reach $1.2 trillion. So Stem is getting in at the beginning of what may be a boom. And the company’s revenue growth would suggest that the ‘boom potential’ is real. The top line grew 166% from 1Q21 to 1Q22, rising from $15.4 million to $41.1 million in one year, and coming in 29% above the high end of the previously published guidance. The company’s quarterly bookings almost tripled, from $51 million one year ago to $151 million in 1Q22. And, despite running quarterly net losses, Stem finished the first quarter this year with a usable balance of $352 million in cash and liquid assets. All of this caught the attention of George Soros, who’s bought up 300,000 shares of Stem in Q1. These shares are worth $2.25 million at current prices. Guggenheim analyst Joseph Osha, rated 5-stars at TipRanks, is also bullish here. He notes that the company’s Q1 results beat his expectations, and then adds, “STEM still faces a multi-year period during which much of the company’s revenue is likely to consist of low-margin storage hardware sales, but our confidence is growing that the company should be able to earn good returns by managing and dispatching storage assets. At this point, the company’s full-year targets appear reasonable, in our view, and in fact the annualized recurring revenue target of $60–80 million by yearend looks conservative to us."" These comments back up Osha’s Buy rating on STEM stock, while his $16 price target indicates room for ~115% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Osha’s track record, click here) For the most part, Wall Street’s analysts agree that this is a stock to buy. Stem shares have 5 recent analyst reviews, including 4 Buys over 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $7.49 and its $16.40 average price target suggests its has ~120% upside ahead of it. (See STEM stock forecast on TipRanks) Webster Financial (WBS) The next Soros pick is Webster Financial. This is a holding company, the parent of Webster Bank. This Connecticut-based banking firm has approximately $65 billion in assets and offers a range of services, including consumer and commercial banking, personal and business loans, and wealth management. Webster has a commitment to growth, and in February of this year it completed its merger with Sterling Bancorp. With that transaction complete, Webster now has $44 billion in loans, $53 billion in deposits, and a network of 202 branches in the Northeast. Webster’s first quarter of 2022 showed a net interest income of $394 million, up 76% year-over-year. The company’s interest-generating assets showed substantial growth over the past year, increasing from $19.2 billion to $50.3 billion, a gain of 61%. Webster increased its loans and leases outstanding by 67%, from$14.4 billion to $35.9 billion, and saw its average deposits increase from $17.6 billion to $45.9 billion, or 62%. These gains in income and income generation supported Webster’s continued payment of its dividend, which was declared in April at 40 cents per common share. With an annualized rate of $1.60 per share, the dividend currently yields 3.45%. Turning to Soros’ activity here, the billionaire purchased 42,100 shares of WBS stock in Q1, which are now worth a total of $2.02 million. Soros isn’t the only one giving this stock some love. 5-star analyst William Wallace, of Raymond James, puts a Strong Buy rating here, and a $73 target price that suggests ~52% upside in the year ahead. (To watch Wallace’s track record, click here) Backing his bullish stance, Wallace writes: “All in, our thesis remains unchanged, where we believe cost and growth targets from the Sterling deal are attainable, and the financial merits of the deal continue to be mispriced, leaving room for upside. That said, as progress is shown towards deal targets, which look increasingly reasonable, we believe shares should recover their discount and ultimately trade at a premium relative to its mid-cap peer group valuation comparison.” Overall, of the 8 recent analyst reviews published for WBS, 6 are Buys and 2 are Holds, backing a Strong Buy rating. The stock has an average price target of $70.25, implying ~47% upside from the share price of $47.81. (See WBS stock forecast on TipRanks) Synovus Financial Corporation (SNV) Let’s wrap up with Synovus, another denizen of the financial world. This financial services company, based in Columbus, Georgia, commands some $56 billion in assets and has 272 branches across the Southeast, in Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. This is a high-growth region, known as one of the country’s economic drivers. Florida is the country’s third-largest state, and Tennessee, with no state income tax, hits above its weight in attracting business growth. This is Synovus’ playing field. In 1Q22, Synovus reported a year-over-year drop in earnings. Diluted EPS fell from $1.19 in the year-ago quarter to $1.11 in the current report. At the same time, the bank increased its loan business in the quarter. Total loans grew from $38.8 billion one year ago to $40.1 billion as of March 31. Total deposits grew a modest 3%, from $47.3 billion to $48.6 billion. Synovus still felt confident to boost its dividend payment for the first time since the start of 2020. In its March declaration, the company increased the common share dividend from 33 cents to 34 cents. At an annualized payment of $1.36, this gives a yield of 3.5%. Soros liked what he saw here, and in the last quarter he bought 40,800 shares. At current prices, these are now worth $1.65 million. The controversial billionaire wasn’t the only bull on Synovus. In coverage for Wells Fargo, analyst Jared Shaw writes, “The effects of streamlining the franchise, reducing overall credit risk, expansion into faster growing FL markets, and a head start on digital offerings were materializing throughout 2021, with increased momentum providing a boost year to date. We believe SNV reached an inflection point in 2021, and think the asset sensitivity combined with an upgraded management growth outlook for '24 will drive shares higher.” To this end, Shaw gives SNV stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, and his price target, of $65, indicates potential for 60% appreciation in the next 12 months. (To watch Shaw’s track record, click here) All in all, this stock gets a unanimous Strong Buy from the Street’s consensus, based on 7 recent analyst reviews. The stock is selling for $40.6 and its $58.71 average price target suggests ~45% upside from that level.

5/18/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors who bet against ETFs tracking Russian assets in the build up to the Ukraine invasion made the right call -- and they’ve been paying the price ever since. Most Read from Bloomberg Onetime Richest Singapore Tycoon Has Lost 80% of His Fortune Meet the Hedge-Fund Manager Who Warned of Terra’s $60 Billion Implosion Omicron Is Turning Out to Be a Weak Vaccine Elon Musk Says Twitter Must Prove Bot Claims for $44 Billion Deal to Proceed Microsoft Will Boost Pay and Stock Compensation to Retain Employees Stocks linked to Russia plunged following the outbreak of war and subsequent economic punishment meted out to the country, vindicating bearish wagers. But sanctions also made trading Russian securities almost impossible, leaving short sellers unable to exit their positions. The result? Investors who shorted -- sold borrowed shares with the intention of buying them back more cheaply before returning them -- are still borrowing, paying the associated fees indefinitely. The short-selling world is notoriously opaque and dominated by institutions who rarely disclose their bets. But based on available data, technology and analytics firm S3 Partners estimates short sellers of Russia-focused exchange-traded funds have paid around $2.6 million in borrow fees since the products were halted in early March. “Short sellers are in a position where they’re effectively halted or frozen right now,” said Jacob Rappaport, head of equities at trading house StoneX. “It’s a difficult position to be in when there’s no resolution in sight.” Of course, all the investors in funds like the VanEck Russia ETF (ticker RSX) and the iShares MSCI Russia ETF (ERUS) are effectively stuck after U.S. exchanges halted trading and issuers ceased creating and redeeming shares because underlying assets had become untradable. But generally, most fees on the vehicles have been waived so holders aren’t bleeding cash. Short sellers, on the other hand, are usually paying a daily market rate for the shares they borrowed. The average rate for the ETFs has jumped this year to about 16% from 1%, according to S3. And while short interest in the ETFs was decreasing before they stopped trading, over $96 million worth of shares in the funds remain on loan, according to S3. Ian Bezek, a Colombia-based investor and financial writer, has a $10,800 short position on ERUS. The 33-year-old is now paying an annualized borrow rate hovering at around 60%. “If the borrow fees were like 5% or 10%, then not a problem. But at 60%, it’s definitely a major aggravation,” he said. “I have no idea of when the situation will change. It’s very frustrating.” There’s still no clarity about how or when the freeze on the ETFs will end, nor how it will be resolved. Moscow-listed stocks are trading again, but foreigners aren’t allowed to sell them. Meanwhile, Russian companies with depositary receipts listed overseas -- which several of the ETFs hold -- are being forced to delist them by a law that took effect last month. One trader at a family office who is short RSX said he asked three prime brokers about how he’ll be able to cover and none of the brokers had answers. The trader, who asked not to be identified, said he also asked about obtaining shares over-the-counter, but brokers and market makers seem unwilling to conduct those transactions. The short-selling headache looks like a first in the ETF industry. In previous dramas, when a market or group of assets has shuttered, the structure of ETFs has allowed them to keep trading. When the underlying assets restarted, often they fell in line with ETF pricing. It’s a measure of the turmoil that on this occasion, ETFs had to halt, too. Read more: ETFs Finally Find a Crisis They Can’t Trade Through in Ukraine The securities-lending market falls under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission, though it’s unclear whether regulators will get involved because no rules have been broken. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment. RSX, the largest Russia-focused ETF, had an annualized borrow rate that hovered at 1% at the start of the year, according to S3. As Russia-Ukraine tensions intensified, the rate spiked above 20% before coming down slightly. The data from S3 captures the market rate, but rates can vary across brokers. Short sellers aren’t the only group hit by these rising borrowing costs. Some put holders also tapped the securities lending market to find the shares to exercise their options -- and those who did are still paying. Russell Edwards, a U.K.-based retail trader, managed to borrow 2,200 shares of RSX to exercise put options that expired in March. His brokerage requires him to pay borrow fees currently running at about 30%. It’s a minor drag on his tiny portfolio for now, but the 26-year-old has no idea how long it will last. “If suddenly those shares cost a lot more to loan and it’s at 300% next day, I don’t really have any recourse to” help avoid the fees, he said. “I’m just kind of stuck waiting.” In the fog of the invasion and sanctions, some holders and brokers have stopped making shares available to loan, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3. That, alongside the halt to new share creation by issuers, has capped the supply available to borrow, leading rates to rise, he said. Being trapped in their bearish bets has also left borrowers facing the possibility that their winning wagers will be losers by the time they can get out. They need funds and stocks trading again to cover their positions, but that would likely only happen if the Russia-Ukraine war de-escalated and the outlook improved dramatically -- which could trigger a recovery in asset prices. In such a scenario, “I wouldn’t be surprised if my short position ends up losing me a lot of money,” said Abraham Miller, a Seattle-based software engineer who is shorting ERUS.

5/18/2022,"The Dow Jones index finished last week with a modest loss, even after a late-week rally in Friday’s session. It marked the seventh week in a row that the Dow posted a weekly loss, it’s longest such streak in two decades. That capped a brutal season of market losses, all across the board. The S&P 500 is down 16% this year, and the NASDAQ, with a year-to-date loss of 25%, is into bear market territory. Investors have been giving conflicting sets of reactions to the market’s fall. Coming at it from a bearish angle is Morgan Stanley’s strategist Michael Wilson, who writes, “We continue to believe that the US equity market is not priced for this slowdown in growth from current levels. We expect equity volatility to remain elevated over the next 12 months.” To cope with these market gyrations and increased volatility, Wilson recommends a hard shift into defensive stocks – and plenty of the Street’s analysts have been going that route, too. Using TipRanks' database, we’ve pulled up the latest info on two stocks that fit the bill. These are high-yield dividend payers, offering defensive investors yields of 8% or better. Each stock also holds a Strong Buy consensus rating; let’s see what makes them so attractive to Wall Street’s analysts. Ares Capital Corporation (ARCC) We'll start with a business development company (BDC), Ares Capital Corporation. These are specialty finance firms that work in parallel to the banking industry and provide access to capital, credit, and other financial instruments for small- and mid-market enterprises that would not necessarily have access to the major banks. Ares, which is based in New York City, makes it possible for small businesses, America’s traditional economic driver, to remain solvent. Ares maintains a highly diversified portfolio of enterprise investments, with its hands – and funds – in a wide range of assets classes, industries, and geographic locations. The company’s investment portfolio currently holds 395 companies, backed by over 200 private equity sponsors, and boasts a fair value of $19.5 billion. The 1Q22 results, however, were somewhat mixed. Net investment income came in at $198 million, or 41 cents per share, compared to $144 million, 33 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company reported a core EPS of 42 cents, roughly flat y/y from 1Q21’s 43 cents, and below analyst expectations of 47 cents. Despite the miss in the financial results, Ares declared a 42-cent per common share dividend for 2Q22. This adds to the already announced 3-cent special dividend, which is scheduled for payments through the end of this year. The regular dividend, of 42 cents, annualizes to $1.68 and yields a robust 8.75%. Add in the special payment, and the current yield rises to 9.37%. Covering the stock for J.P. Morgan's Melissa Wedel believes ARCC presents a compelling risk reward. The analyst writes, ""We believe the strength of ARCC’s origination platform, sizable balance sheet, access to capital markets, and ample liquidity position the company favorably. ARCC’s scale and industry relationships enable the BDC to continue to make competitive, high-credit-quality investments. We believe ARCC’s position as one of the largest BDC platforms affords an advantage in deploying capital opportunistically during market stress and securing funding. We believe ARCC’s solid capital and liquidity position as well as its position as one of the market leaders is not reflected in the share price, resulting in a compelling entry point for investors."" Based on all of the above factors, Wedel rates ARCC shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) and her $22 price target implies a 13% upside by year’s end. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~22% potential total return profile. (To watch Wedel’s track record, click here) JPM’s bullish stance on this stock is no outlier – the shares have 6 positive analyst reviews, for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. ARCC is priced at $19.51 and its $22.33 average price target suggests ~15% gain from that level over the next 12 months. (See ARCC stock forecast on TipRanks) Owl Rock Capital (ORCC) The second dividend stock we’ll look at is another BDS firm. Owl Rock also functions as a financing specialist in the mid-market enterprise niche, providing credit, loan facilities, and capital access for the small and medium enterprise sector. Owl Rock’s portfolio brings in approximately $658 million in annual revenues. The full portfolio includes 74% first lien senior secured debts, and 14.7% second lien senior secured debts. The company has investments in 157 companies which have an aggregate value of $12.8 billion. Owl Rock’s average investment in a portfolio company is $81.3 million. In the first quarter of this year, Owl Rock saw its investment income increase year-over-year from $221.6 million to $264.2 million, for a gain of 19%. Per share, net investment income came in at 31 cents. This was down from 35 cents in the year-ago quarter, and also missed the 33-cent forecast. However, the company’s earnings were sufficient to keep up the dividend. Owl Rock declared a dividend for Q2 of 31 cents, equal to the quarterly investment income. This marked the sixth quarter in a row with the dividend held at this level. Annualized, the payment comes to $1.24 and yields a robust 9.3%. That gives investors a full point above the April inflation rate, and ensures a true realized return. 5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers Owl Rock for JMP Securities, and takes a bullish stand on the firm. “We remain constructive on Owl Rock Capital despite the lighter quarter of net investment income generation and slight decline in book value/share. We were encouraged to see a 3rd consecutive quarter of covering the dividend with net investment income, particularly given the light quarter of repayment related fee income that had been a material component of results in 2H21 due to elevated activity levels in the back half of the year,"" Ryan opined. ""Additionally, management’s diligence in extending duration and building a cost-efficient, predominantly fixed-rate liability structure positions earnings to benefit from a rising rate environment. In short, we believe that Owl Rock should continue to deliver strong performance with a fully-scaled investment portfolio,” the analyst added. In line with these bullish comments, Ryan rates ORCC shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $16 price target indicates potential for ~19% upside in the months ahead. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here) Overall, Wall Street’s analysts have given these shares 6 recent reviews and they break down 5 to 1 in favor of Buys over Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus on the stock. ORCC is trading for $13.47 and its $15.46 average price target suggests it has ~15% one-year upside to look forward to.

5/18/2022,"Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank’s decision to delay its response to the highest inflation rates in four decades “was a mistake.” Bernanke, who served two terms as chair of the Federal Reserve during the Bush and Obama administrations, helped guide the country through the 2008 financial crisis—another time in which the central bank played an outsized role in trying to help the economy recover. But speaking to CNBC on Monday, Bernanke said that while he understands the reasoning behind the Fed’s delayed response, the Jay Powell-led Fed should have acted sooner to help bring down inflation rates that rose as high as 8.5% year-over-year in April. “Why did they delay their response? I think in retrospect, yes, it was a mistake,” Bernanke told CNBC on Monday. “And I think they agree it was a mistake.” Bernanke said the Fed avoided taking more immediate action out of fears that it would “shock the market.” Throughout 2021, while inflation rates were steadily rising, much of the public response from the Fed was based around a belief that the rising rates were “transitory,” or as Powell described it at the time, not enough to “leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation.” It wasn’t until December 2021 that Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said it was “time to retire” the transitory label, and began taking more impactful measures to limit the rise. Since then, the Fed has taken more drastic steps to try to bring down inflation rates, including through two rate hikes that will push mortgage rates, auto rates, credit card interest, and borrowing rates much higher. “It's not gonna be pleasant,” Powell acknowledged earlier this month. Under Powell, who was confirmed by the Senate last week for a second term, the Federal Reserve has faced a string of crises due to the coronavirus pandemic-induced economic crash and now the decades-high inflation rates. According to Bernanke, it's all headed towards a possible scenario in which the U.S. economy could enter a period of “stagflation,” or a combination of economic stagnation and high inflation, coupled with increased unemployment. “Even under the benign scenario, we should have a slowing economy,” Bernanke told The New York Times on Monday. “And inflation’s still too high but coming down. So there should be a period in the next year or two where growth is low, unemployment is at least up a little bit and inflation is still high…So you could call that stagflation.” Bernanke, whose new book is out on Tuesday, also offered his thoughts on the calls for President Biden to forgive the $1.75 trillion in total U.S. student loan debt. “It would be very unfair to eliminate [all student debt],” Bernanke told The New York Times. “Many of the people who have large amounts of student debt are professionals who are going to go on and make lots of money in their lifetime. So why would we be favoring them over somebody who didn’t go to college, for example?” In recent months, Biden has reportedly debated instituting widespread student loan forgiveness, while also considering adding income caps that would exclude high earners from student loan relief. The Biden administration has already canceled the most student loan debt of any administration in history, forgiving $16 billion in federal student loans for targeted groups such as disabled borrowers, and students who were defrauded by their institutions.
