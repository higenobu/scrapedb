5/8/2022,"“There are plenty of stages to go in the ownership discussion,” said Alex Mahon, the ever-optimistic chief executive of Channel 4, days before the government’s plans to privatise the broadcaster are to be announced in this week’s Queen’s speech. On Thursday, Mahon publicly shared what she termed an “attractive, realistic and sustainable alternative” to the government’s dogged pursuit of a sale of Channel 4 that ministers hope could net £2bn. Her package of proposals, which has been dismissed by the government in private meetings, marks a last-ditch effort to head off what has become the most serious push of about half a dozen attempts at privatisation since Channel 4 was launched almost four decades ago. The government’s privatisation plans form part of a draft media bill, which includes a number of welcome legislative measures, including forcing on-demand TV services to prominently feature British public broadcasters’ content. The bill will need to get through a near two-year process in the House of Commons and the Lords before the largest privatisation since Royal Mail in 2013 is complete. Ministers have been buoyed by more than two dozen expressions of interest from potential buyers to its banking advisers JP Morgan, fuelling hopes of a £2bn bidding war, although many of these will be rivals just keen for a look at Channel 4’s books. Industry estimates put its value at a maximum of £1.5bn. Potential bidders range from Sky and ITV to Channel 5 owner Paramount, Warner Bros Discovery and Vivendi, the French owner of pay-TV operator Canal+. In 2017, Channel 4 escaped privatisation in a deal with culture secretary Karen Bradley, who deemed the broadcaster a “precious public asset”, by agreeing to move large parts of its operations out of London to benefit the rest of the UK. Channel 4’s new plan doubles down on this with a promise to move a total of 600 of its 800 staff outside London, making it “northern-based” and the “levelling-up broadcaster”, while planning to increase programme investment to £1bn. But this time the government is refusing to compromise, claiming that Channel 4 will not be able to compete in the Netflix-era as a publicly owned company. Mahon argues that Netflix, which has seen its subscriber numbers go into reverse globally, is a partner, not a rival. Despite 96% of the 56,000 respondents to its consultation saying they were against privatisation, and mounting opposition from Labour and Tory ministers, the government is ploughing ahead with the biggest shake-up to UK broadcasting since Channel 5 was launched in 1997. The government plans to scrap Channel 4’s unique business model, devised by Margaret Thatcher’s government, which stops it from owning the shows it commissions, so that independent TV production companies can thrive by selling the rights after they are shown. The government has stipulated that a new owner must continue to commission an unspecified “minimum volume of programming” from indie producers. But Channel 4 and industry analysts estimate that this will cost thousands of jobs and result in the loss of hundreds of millions of pounds annually to small producers – many of which could struggle to survive. A profit-maximising private owner would also look to increase margins at a stroke by cutting Channel 4’s £700m programming budget as well as focusing on the most commercially viable content. Channel 4 believes investment in unprofitable or more culturally challenging fare, from It’s A Sin and the Paralympics to films such as Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, would never get commissioned by an owner focused on the bottom line. News and documentaries would also be targeted, and cutbacks would be expected at its “national HQ” in Leeds, and hubs in Glasgow and Bristol. Despite the government steadfastly pursuing privatisation, Channel 4 believes that now the plans are public, it can throw its weight behind opposing them and pull off an 11th-hour reprieve, remaining in taxpayers’ hands, as the broadcaster has managed to do in the past. “There is a long way to run in this process and our role is to be here with advice, clarity, precision and fact about what the impact of certain choices will be,” says Mahon. “The reality is that Channel 4 is 39½ years old, I reckon we are going to make it to our 40th birthday, it’s not going to go through that fast. The truth is that it is an institution and an important part of the UK’s broadcast landscape. Public service broadcasting in the UK is incredibly strong and phenomenally important. Anything that might change that role is an important question to debate.”",News/Media,Channel 4 chief looks north in bid to resist privatisation,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/08/channel-4-chief-looks-north-in-bid-to-resist-privatisation

5/8/2022,"Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool should not behave “like it is a funeral” after being held at home by Tottenham but admitted he cannot envisage Manchester City dropping any more points in the title race. Liverpool replaced City at the top of the table but only on goal difference after their 12-match winning streak at Anfield ended with a 1-1 draw against Antonio Conte’s side. Pep Guardiola’s team can open up a three-point lead with victory over Newcastle on Sunday and Klopp does not expect the reigning champions to falter over their remaining four games. “It is an important point because it is one point more than before the game but we all know the situation,” the Liverpool manager said. “We are now top of the table. My favourite situation is if we and City lose all our remaining games and we stay top but we all know it will not be like this. “I would love here to sit here and say, yes, City will drop points but I can’t see it. We will see what happens. My problem is not City against Newcastle tomorrow, it is that we play against Aston Villa on Tuesday. One point more than before, good, from 1-0 down it is massively better, but it was not exactly what we want. Now we have to deal with it but we will.” Klopp insisted there was no reason for his players to be downcast about their title prospects. He added: “First and foremost we should stop behaving like it is a funeral. In my life much worse things happen. The only chance we have is if something goes our way. Imagine City lose, I can’t see it, but imagine if they do and we lose it [the title] because we don’t believe any more. That would be crazy.” Conte was impressed by Spurs’ composure and bravery in possession but lamented a lack of clinical edge in front of goal. The Spurs manager said: “We have to be satisfied, it is not easy to play in this moment against an amazing team. But I have seen in the eyes of my players a bit of disappointment because we had the chances to win the game.” Tottenham’s effective counterattacking style did not impress Klopp, however. The Liverpool manager said: “I don’t like this kind of football but that is my problem. I cannot coach it. I respect what they do with world-class players but I cannot coach that.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp tells Liverpool ‘don’t behave like it is a funeral’ after title blow,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/07/jurgen-klopp-tells-liverpool-dont-behave-like-it-is-a-funeral-after-title-blow
5/8/2022,"With 56 minutes gone, as the sky began to fade from powder blue to black, Emerson Royal pumped a hopeful pass into the empty air above the roof-lights, seeking out Harry Kane, who craned his neck, adjusting his feet, reading the arc. At that point the game seemed to fall apart a little. For almost an hour this had been a close, stifling game. Just before half-time Liverpool had applied one of those periods of surge-football, where they seem to be playing out of the same red mist, winning the ball back repeatedly, forcing the Spurs players to sweat and puff and turn a little dizzy. But suddenly there was space. Trent Alexander-Arnold dawdled. Kane killed the ball on the bounce and surging infield, feeling that inbuilt two-way radar start to twang, registering that familiar figure up ahead. Kane and Son. This is not a partnership. It is a deep and meaningful commitment. It’s fireworks. The ball was nudged on to Ryan Sessegnon, making a fine run outside. And by now that pressure was gone. The shapes were clear, the angles set. Sessegnon produced the perfect cutback and Son Heung-min was there to tap it into the net, reward for a relentless, fearless performance. And in that moment the season began to turn a little. This was always a high-stakes game: another peg in that unforgiving title run-in, and for Spurs a treacherous step in their own pursuit of fourth place. The top line will be two points dropped by Liverpool. They are now reliant on Manchester City losing one or drawing two. It will surely go right to the end but with an edge now, a feeling that City can find some clear blue air in this race. But the story of the night was Tottenham, and a sense of transformation. Liverpool were a level below their high-throttle best. But Spurs achieved something remarkable in its own right. They didn’t look like Spurs. They looked a modern, aggressive, well-drilled team. They defended with rigour. And in Son they had not just the most potent attacker on the pitch, but the Premier League player of the second half of the season. What a footballer he is. And what a conundrum too, that strangest of things in a sport where every detail is relentlessly hyped, fawned over, puffed to absurd degrees of ultimacy, Goat-dom, celebrification. Somehow, in the middle of all this, in Son we have a player who is underrated, just a little. The numbers are sensational. Son has nine goals in his last seven Premier League games, at a time when the season is narrowing to a cold, hard point. Is there a more complete ball-carrying attacker around at the moment? Son’s range is stunning. He can run 60 yards with the ball, as he did here just after half-time, surging through the centre, thrumming that super smooth automatic gearbox out of traffic, veering left, able to switch feet and jink even as his muscles start to burn. He can play the short game too, combining in small spaces, finding angles and triangles. He can finish. He can pass. He can shoot from distance. Watching him play like this against the Champions League finalists, it is hard to see why there is never any talk about the Son move, the Son step up, the Son mega-bid. We know about the Kane talk. But why does it stop there? Why does it seem so hard to pick out the blur of speed and precision alongside him, playing off each other like two men roped together on a mountain. Son is two goals behind Mo Salah for the Premier League golden boot now. Antonio Conte deserves credit for harnessing his skill-set, the mobility, the passing, the finishing, if only because Son is so good at this now, and so consistent in his levels. But given a week to prepare, Spurs were ready. Conte had come to Anfield in navy blue smart casual and white soled dad-trainers, like a man on his way to the yacht club drinks. For much of the first half he pranced and whirled, kept urging his players to look upfield, pointing to the flanks, pointing to possibilities, half-seen passes. And the sharp edge of this game was always likely to be the interaction between Tottenham’s chief weapon, the Son-Kane express, and Liverpool’s daringly high defensive line. They sprang the trap for the first time on six minutes, Kane and Son combining ominously down the left. Spurs’ wide players were causing problems, Royal and Sessegnon hugging the touchline as Liverpool’s full-backs flew upfield or came inside. The first tremors of anxiety hit around the half-hour mark. Spurs looked solid. They resisted as Liverpool produced a spell of all-out, bespoke Klopp-era pressure. Luis Díaz would equalise, deservedly, with 74 minutes gone. But this was a huge result for Tottenham. It means they are now a point up on their expected total. A draw against Arsenal would be a decent enough result. They will feel they can hold the balance of play against anyone. Conte has seemed to be on the verge of leaving ever since he arrived. Watching this it felt as though he might just be on his way to creating something of substance.",Sport/Football,Klopp’s men made to suffer by Kane-Son express | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/07/klopps-title-chasers-made-to-suffer-at-the-hands-of-kane-son-express
5/8/2022,"Charles Leclerc claimed pole for the inaugural Miami Grand Prix with another demonstration of superb precision, executed flawlessly for Ferrari driving on what is a testing track that has been punishing drivers across the weekend. His title rival Max Verstappen was pressured into a small error that cost him and he could manage only third, with Leclerc’s teammate Carlos Sainz in second, while the audience at the Miami International Autodrome’s first competitive session boisterously revelled in the show they put on. Lewis Hamilton, who had been hoping for some improvement from Mercedes this week, improved on his recent qualifying form with sixth place but his team remain eight-tenths back from the leaders. A capacity crowd of 82,500 roared on their driving heroes as Miami ensured a noisy, vibrant welcome and the drivers duly took to the stage with some tense and testing runs that emphasised how the single lap discipline remains a charged, gripping spectacle. The crowd has come for entertainment and they have paid handsomely to do so, with ticket prices opening at $900 for a three-day pass. Thus far Miami has delivered, they have basked in the fulsome facilities and trackside, the beaming grins, and party atmosphere was one of a crowd who had unashamedly come to enjoy themselves. Purists may sniff at the glitz of the racing business in Miami but certainly not the fans here for whom the event was successfully tailored. The drivers gave them a suitably feisty appetiser for Sunday’s race. The session had always looked to come down to a showdown between the two leading title protagonists, Verstappen and Leclerc and so it proved as they made their final decisive laps but Sainz was also insistent he too would not be ignored. On his first hot lap in Q3 Leclerc was quick through the first two sectors but Verstappen behind him was immense in the final, tight testing sequence of turns, his time of 1min 28.991sec had the edge over Leclerc by just six-hundredths. On the final laps, Leclerc once more opened the running and pushed hard, up in the first sector and again the middle he made the difference at the close setting a time of 1min 28.796sec. Sainz so nearly matched him and did indeed go quicker in the opening sector to a roar from the crowd only to be pipped by two-tenths. Verstappen pushed but a small error and some oversteer cost him through turn five as he rued losing time to mechanical problems in practice. He was forced to back off and was beaten by Sainz as well. He was having to give it his all such are the margins between the leaders but there is little to choose between Ferrari and Red Bull in race pace, a tense showdown awaits on Sunday. Yet it is Leclerc with his third pole this season who is again in the best possible position to extend a formidable 27-point lead over Verstappen. Mercedes had been hoping to make some steps forward in Miami. They had upgrades brought to the car and they do appear to have delivered some improvement. Certainly Hamilton felt happier especially after some trying qualifying runs this year. “It was a much, much better qualifying session than I’ve had for the last three races,” he said. “So I’m grateful for that to be honest and I’ll take it,” However with George Russell who was quick earlier in the weekend in 12th stating he had “no confidence” in the car, the team clearly have a long way to go. “It’s a bit inconsistent,” he said. “When we get it into the window it’s fast. The potential was there.” They were not expecting to overcome their issues in one fell swoop but Hamilton’s position suggests at least some incremental progress. Britain’s Jamie Chadwick won the opening race of the new W Series all-female championship season in Miami. The reigning champion lost and re-took the lead in a competitive and incident-packed race. Marta García from Spain took second and Britain’s Jessica Hawkins, who is a driver ambassador for the Aston Martin F1 team, was third. Chadwick is the defending W Series champion, having won the series’ first two seasons but had to work hard to win on her first outing this year. The 23-year-old is racing this season for the team backed by former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner and has opened her third season in W Series with a strong statement of intent. “That was a bizarre race, I don’t know what happened but we will take that,” she said. Valterri Bottas was in fifth for Alfa Romeo, Pierre Gasly in seventh for AlphaTauri with his teammate Yuki Tsunoda in ninth. Lando Norris was in eighth for McLaren and Lance Stroll in tenth for Aston Martin. Fernando Alonso was in 11th for Alpine and Sebastian Vettel was in 13th Aston Martin, with Daniel Ricciardo in 14th for McLaren and Mick Schumacher in 15th for Haas. Alex Albon and Nicholas Latifi were in 18th and 19th for Williams. Kevin Magnussen was in 16th for Haas and Zhou Guanyu in 17th for Alfa Romeo. Alpine’s Esteban Ocon did not take part in qualifying after he suffered a cracked chassis from a crash in final practice. He will start the race from the back of the grid.",Sport/Sport,Charles Leclerc seals pole while Ferrari lock front row for Miami Grand Prix,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/07/charles-leclerc-seals-pole-while-ferrari-lock-front-row-for-miami-grand-prix
