3/24/2022,"The Victorian Liberal MP Wendy Lovell has come under fierce criticism for saying there is “no point” in having social housing in wealthy areas “where the children cannot mix with others”. Lovell, who pointed to low-income families’ inability to afford “the latest in sneakers and iPhones” as a reason children would struggle to fit in, made the comments on Wednesday during debate in the state parliament’s upper house about a Greens bill to set a target to end homelessness in Victoria by 2030. The former housing minister said the most vulnerable Victorians must be given access to long-term social housing, which is integrated with both public and private residents. “It only creates stigma if people can see that difference, so we need to make sure that [social housing] properties are not as identifiable as they have been in the past,” Lovell told the Legislative Council. “We also need to make sure that we put those properties in areas where families are accepted and where families can flourish. “There is no point putting a very low income, probably welfare-dependent family in the best street in Brighton where the children cannot mix with others or go to the school with other children, or where they do not have the same ability to have the latest in sneakers and iPhones.” Lovell said social housing residents need to “actually fit into a neighbourhood” so that they can “have a good life”. Labor MP Mark Gepp, who grew up in public housing in the 1960s, in his speech described the comments as “bloody disgraceful”, prompting an interjection from Lovell, and another fiery response from Gepp. “Everybody in this place heard it loudly and clearly … ‘Oh, we don’t want the kids to be teased because they have got a Samsung phone instead of an iPhone’,” he said. “Well, bollocks to that, because your position on the socio-economic ladder should never determine your participation in this society under any circumstances. Shame on you for suggesting that it should.” The Victorian opposition leader, Matthew Guy, said on Thursday that Lovell “means well” but her wording was clumsy. “[She] made some exceptionally clumsy remarks in talking about stigmatisation,” he told reporters outside parliament. “As a former housing minister, she certainly tried to find the best intention. It hasn’t certainly been put that way. Social housing in my view should go where there are services available to people who need them.” Victorian Greens leader Samantha Ratnam described Lovell’s comments as offensive, saying they perpetuate misguided stereotypes about who lives in social housing. “People who live in public and social housing are all of us. My grandparents lived in public housing. They are members of parliament who spoke so passionately and eloquently yesterday about growing up in public housing,” she said. “They’re the tens of thousand of Victorians on the waiting list for housing who are locked out of the exorbitant housing market. It is an issue that affects every one of us.” The housing minister, Richard Wynne, said Lovell’s comments were “an appalling example of the Liberal Party’s postcode snobbery”. “Matthew Guy should step in and apologise, not just on behalf of the Liberal Party, he should apologise to all those who have lived in public housing,” Wynne said in a statement. In 2017, the Victorian government announced it was building 10 homes for people sleeping rough on South Road in Brighton, one of Melbourne’s wealthiest suburbs. Brighton MP James Newbury at the 2018 election announced a Coalition government would close the facility and sell the land.",News/Australia news,Victorian Liberal MP Wendy Lovell chastised for saying children in social housing ‘cannot mix’ in wealthy areas,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/victorian-liberal-mp-wendy-lovell-chastised-for-saying-children-in-social-housing-cannot-mix-in-wealthy-areas

In a statement on Instagram on Thursday, the 42-year-old former Silverchair frontman revealed he had recently started experiencing panic attacks and was in a car accident after becoming “lost” on the road. “As you know, my mental health is a work in progress. I have good days and bad days but it’s something I always have to manage,” he wrote. “Over the last week I began to experience panic attacks. Last night I got lost while driving and I was in an accident. I am OK, everyone is OK. “Alongside my therapy, I’ve been self-medicating with alcohol to deal with my anxiety and depression. I know this is not sustainable or healthy. “I have to step back now as I’m self-admitting to a rehabilitation centre and I don’t know how long I’ll be there.

3/24/2022,"Next week’s budget is guaranteed to be all things to all people – unless you are one of those people who the government thinks won’t vote for them. And while there is always a bit of guess work about what will or won’t be in the budget speech, you can be sure it will definitely contain a tax cut that is not a cut. This year’s budget will have a lot more revenue than was expected 18 months ago. Back in September 2020, in the depths of the pandemic, the outlook for tax revenue was not good. But since then, billions of unexpected revenue is coming into the Treasury’s coffers: If the graph does not display click here Mostly this has occurred because the pandemic has proven to be the most unusual recession in history – one that behaved unlike what happened in the 1970s, 80s and 90s recessions for the simple reason that this recession was purely driven by regulation. And once the lockdowns were lifted the country was no longer in recession. It also helped that the government, after much pushing, implemented a quasi-wage guarantee with Jobkeeper that prevented income tax revenue collapsing like it normally does during a recession. Next week, the extra revenue is set to continue because not only has inflation increased faster than expected, commodity prices have taken off because of the war in Ukraine: If the graph does not display click here This will lead to increased company tax revenue that will enable the government to spend a lot more money and still be able to say it is on the same path to a budget surplus. Of course any talk about “budget management” or concerns about a surplus are all just cow manure when we still have the Stage 3 tax cuts in place. The cuts, worth $15.7bn each year, are the most destructive policy for budget management and for equality in living memory. But they are also part of the ongoing reason why we have a tax cut that does not really exist. I was amused a month ago that there were suggestions that the government might dump the low to middle income tax offset (LMITO). This was never going to happen because it is an election year and doing so would hand a majority of voters a tax rise. The LMITO was a device needed in the Stage 1 round of tax cuts because Stages 2 and 3 of the government’s tax plan were massively skewed to favour the wealthy. The government needed to make it seem as if they cared about poorer people and so it introduced an offset that was “targeted” at low to middle income earners. The fudge though was in the name. The median employee income in Australia is about $62,400, and yet the highest offset of $1,080 from the LIMTO went to those earning between $48,000 and $90,000, and the offset extended to those earning $120,000. It was, shall we say more of a “middle to above average income” offset. It was meant to be dumped when Stage 2 came in because those tax cuts would cancel out the removal of the LMITO. The Stage 2 cut would be worth, for example, $1,080 for someone on $60,000, so removing the LMITO would have made such a person no worse off (and also no better off). When the government brought forward the Stage 2 cuts in 2020 it realised that outcome was not going to fly in the middle of a recession and so it extended the LMITO for a year. And that handed itself a problem. It means that whenever the government removes the LMITO, because it does not have Stage 2 cuts to cancel it out, it will be giving people earning less than $120,000 a tax increase. https://www.datawrapper.de/_/xMlL6/ Oops. This occurs even with the horrifically unfair Stage 3 tax cuts which will see the marginal tax rate for incomes between $45,000 and $200,000 set at just 30%. Even with that change, if the government also removed the LMITO people earning under $85,000 would still get a tax increase. Because while flattening the tax rate to 30% gives someone on $60,000 a $375 tax cut, they would then miss out on the $1,080 LMITO – ie they would be $705 worse off: If graph is not displaying click here. And so the LMITO will remain and it will continue to be spruiked as a new tax cut. Last year when the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, did the expected and extended the LMITO for another year he said in his budget speech that “over 10 million low and middle income earners will benefit from a new and additional tax cut”. Yes, a tax cut that delivered no actual cut in tax. It is not so much a tax cut as a decision not to increase tax. This year some media organisations are already falling into line. And in an election year expect to hear again that amid handouts designed to temporarily offset increases in petrol prices, we shall once again receive a tax cut that does not cut tax.",News/Business,What to expect in Australia’s next budget?

3/24/2022,"Russian forces have been accused of taking hostage the people of the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, as local officials imposed drinking water rationing on trapped civilians. About 150,000 people are stuck in the northern city with little hope of aid after Russia cut them off from the capital, Kyiv. Ukraine is increasing pressure on Russian forces north-east of Kyiv while carrying out successful counterattacks against Russian positions in towns on the outskirts of the capital, the UK defence ministry has said. Thursday marks one month since Russia invaded Ukraine. Late on Wednesday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: “The original plan of the Russian troops failed already in the first days of the invasion. They thought Ukrainians would be frightened. They thought Ukrainians would not fight. They were wrong.” Western nations will warn the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Thursday that his country will pay “ruinous” costs for invading Ukraine during an unprecedented one-day trio of Nato, G7 and EU summits that will be attended by the US president, Joe Biden. Zelenskiy hoped for “meaningful steps” at the round of summits, noting they would reveal “who is a friend, who is a partner, and who betrayed us for money”. Ahead of the summit, Nato has announced it will double its troops along the alliance’s eastern flank. “The first step is the deployment of four new Nato battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, along with our existing forces in the Baltic countries and Poland,” said the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. Nato countries are also expected to agree at Thursday’s meeting to provide special kit to help protect Ukraine against chemical, biological or nuclear attacks launched by Russia. Britain will provide 6,000 defensive missiles and extra funds to support the Ukrainian military, as well as BBC journalists providing news coverage in the region. The US government has said it believes war crimes have been committed in Ukraine based on its assessment of evidence that civilians have been deliberately targeted. Between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the war, Nato estimates. By way of comparison, Russia lost about 15,000 troops over 10 years in Afghanistan, the Associated Press has reported. The Russian climate envoy Anatoly Chubais has stepped down and left the country in protest against Putin’s war in Ukraine. He is the highest-level official to break with the Kremlin over the invasion. The US said it would announce a package of Russia-related sanctions against political figures and oligarchs on Thursday. A US state department spokesperson confirmed that the US embassy had received a list of diplomats from Russia considered “persona non grata” by the Russian foreign ministry. Israel has blocked Ukraine from buying Pegasus spyware, fearing Russia’s anger. The revelation, after a joint investigation by the Guardian and Washington Post, offers new insight into the way Israel’s relationship with Russia has at times undermined Ukraine’s offensive capabilities – and contradicted US priorities. Putin has said Russia plans to demand payment in roubles for its gas sales to “unfriendly” countries. The announcement sent European futures soaring over concerns the switch would exacerbate a looming energy crisis by jamming up deals that run to hundreds of millions of dollars every day.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 29 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-29-of-the-invasion
3/24/2022,"A group of 54 Ukrainian orphans fleeing the horrors of Vladimir Putin’s bloody war arrived safely at Heathrow airport on Wednesday night. None of the children, from orphanages in Dnipro, central Ukraine, had been on a plane before. Aged between two and 18, they ran up and down the aisles, watched TV shows and played with Disney stuffed toys as they escaped the escalating Russian violence. Accompanied by five carers and a translator, the group were due to arrive from Poland on Monday but were held up by 48 hours due to a delay in providing crucial paperwork. However, late on Wednesday, they touched down on British soil and were en route to western Scotland, where temporary accommodation has been arranged for them. The mammoth operation to bring the children to the UK was a joint effort by Dnipro Kids, a charity established by Hibernian FC supporters who travelled to Dnipro for a match in 2005, and the global paediatric network Save a Child. Sally Becker, Save a Child’s founder, said the organisation became involved when Dnipro Kids, who lacked funding for transport, approached her for help. “[The children] spent most of their time [during the flight] on old phones, those that had one, and sitting around looking into space, wondering what’s going to happen next,” she told the Guardian at Heathrow. “The saddest thing is I couldn’t talk to them, although some had Google Translate on their phone. “There was one boy who, while doing Google Translate about mundane issues, showed me his message and it said ‘Thank you so much, I am grateful that I’m not sitting under the shelling any more’. That probably touched me more than a lot of other things in my life.” She added: “It just makes you realise how many more need help, how many more are out there and I just wish we could get all the countries together and evacuate all the children, all the disabled, all the vulnerable and the men can defend their country without worrying what is happening to their families. It’s just a terrible situation.” The operation, dubbed “Project Light”, was supported by media personality Rob Rinder in his role as ambassador to aid group Magen David Adom (MDA) UK, which organised the flight. Rinder has already been involved in the Ukrainian aid effort, including tracking down the family of his former partner on Strictly Come Dancing in Poland after they fled the fighting. MDA UK’s chief executive, Daniel Burger, worked with Virgin to coordinate the flight from Poland, a country the airline does not usually operate from, while speaking to the Ukrainian authorities in Warsaw and London. He told the Guardian: “I’d been talking with Rob Rinder, who is a friend and also a brand ambassador of MDA, and he was telling me some of the harrowing stories and what he had seen out there. It made me realise even more of the compelling argument to help. “There are so many more [children to help] but you have to start somewhere … We made this happen and it was a very, very special moment watching those children firstly get on the plane in Warsaw and then descend the stairs at Heathrow and get on the buses. All of the crew, the engineers, all of us were in tears. … they’re beginning the next chapter of their lives.” The outgoing flight carried five tonnes of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees in Poland. The home secretary, Priti Patel, tweeted on Wednesday evening that the group had arrived in the UK “to a safe and warm welcome”. She added: “Huge thanks to my team at the UK Home Office, the Ukraine and Poland authorities, the Scottish government and Virgin Atlantic who worked urgently on their swift arrival. The care they will receive will go some way to heal their suffering.”",News/World news,Ukrainian orphans en route to Scotland after landing in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/ukrainian-orphans-en-route-to-scotland-after-landing-in-uk
