5/5/2022,"Peter Dutton attempted to shoot the messenger on Thursday, branding the Guardian a trashy publication and denying he had ever hung the chief of defence out to dry on the Brereton inquiry reforms. Before we get into this attempt at misdirection at the National Press Club debate, we need to step back. When the report into alleged war crimes by Australian special forces in Afghanistan was about to be released in late 2020, the Morrison government was at pains to say it would be taking it extremely seriously. Apart from setting up an Office of the Special Investigator to look into potential criminal cases, the government promised to launch an oversight panel to give the Australian people confidence the Australian Defence Force was putting in place lasting cultural reforms to ensure such travesties could never be repeated. Critical to the reform process was a pledge by then defence minister, Linda Reynolds to keep the public informed via parliament. “In relation to the oversight panel, I will get an official report every quarter from them and I will be reporting regularly to the parliament on their reports to me,” she said. “Can I just stress [that] nothing will be out of bounds for this inquiry.” How many times do you think Dutton – who took over as defence minister in March 2021 – has updated parliament on the work of this oversight panel? The answer is zero. A search of Hansard shows Dutton has not once uttered the word Brereton in the chamber, nor has he said anything about what his own oversight panel has found. Bear in mind that the chief of the ADF, General Angus Campbell, had said in a statement in November 2020: “Transparency is key to this process.” And let’s not forget the handling of Defence’s own Afghanistan inquiry reform plan, which was quietly dumped on the internet on a Friday in late July 2021 without any announcement. Curiously, that happened more than two months after Dutton signed off on the document. That reform plan also stressed the importance of openness. Despite all of the government’s pledges about transparency and lasting reforms, a lot of what we know about Defence’s actions comes through digging by journalists using freedom of information laws. And we can see that, in at least one significant case, Dutton did not take on board quite stark advice from the chief of the ADF. A document obtained by Anthony Galloway of the Nine newspapers showed that Campbell and the secretary of the Department of Defence, Greg Moriarty, presented Dutton with several options about whether to strip the meritorious unit citation from more than 3,000 members of special operations task groups who served in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2013. When announcing his response to the inquiry report back in November 2020, Campbell said units “live and fight as a team” and he accepted the recommendation to revoke the meritorious unit citation. You can read the ministerial submission to Dutton for yourself here, but Campbell and Moriarty’s “preferred option” was to cancel the unit citation whilst allowing individuals to keep and wear the insignia. Dutton went with a different option: retaining the citation except for those ultimately convicted in a court of law or the subject of administrative action. What did Campbell and Moriarty say about this idea? This approach “risks causing significant further harm to the families of those affected by the alleged actions of Australian soldiers”, they said. Perhaps most starkly, they warned: “The retention of the Meritorious Unit Citation poses unacceptable risk to the moral authority of the force and threatens the international and domestic reputation of the Australian Defence Force and its capacity to operate effectively. The action could be perceived by international counterparts as dismissive and a failure to accept accountability for the actions identified in the inquiry.” In the absence of updates to parliament, we are left to gauge progress based on morsels here and there. We learned recently, thanks to an FOI by The Australian’s Ben Packham, that Dutton wrote to Campbell on 2 June 2021 to give his “very strong view that the OSI’s investigations must take precedence over other disciplinary actions you are considering”. “Accordingly, I ask that you suspend administrative action that you might be considering in relation to personnel who held command positions relevant to the scope of the Afghanistan inquiry.” Guardian Australia also recently reported that the government has not yet sorted out what it will do about compensating families of alleged war crimes, despite the previous reform plan setting a deadline of “end-2021” for a decision. The inquiry report by Maj Gen Paul Brereton had said Australia should not wait for a court to establish criminal liability; if there was credible information of an unlawful killing, compensation should be paid swiftly because that would help restore “Australia’s standing” and was “simply the morally right thing to do”. Campbell had originally told reporters he “very much” supported Brereton’s recommendation on compensation. When confronted about his handling of these serious matters within his own portfolio during the NPC debate against his Labor counterpart Brendan O’Connor on Thursday, Dutton began with a sledge at Guardian Australia. “One of my favourite publications,” he said, adding: “I’m being sarcastic, of course.” For full effect, Dutton went on to call it a “trashy publication”. The minister then took issue with the notion that he had hung the chief of the ADF “out to dry”. Dutton said he had “known Angus for many years” and “found him to be an incredibly effective leader, a person with great capability, an affable person … so don’t dare say that I have undermined him as the chief of the defence force. I never have and I never would.” Dutton has, of course, not publicly bagged Campbell (the minister described the CDF as “pragmatic” when he overruled him last April, with the minister maintaining “we shouldn’t be punishing the 99% for the sins of the 1%”). But the minister has very firmly put his own stamp on the response to the Brereton inquiry – and, as the FOI document shows, disregarded very stark advice from the chief of the ADF about an “unacceptable risk to the moral authority of the force”. There is now a lack of transparency surrounding it. Dutton went on to say he had helped set up the Office of the Special Investigator in his previous position as home affairs minister, the whole exercise was “not a plaything” and it would be wrong to comment “on whether a particular investigation is up to a certain stage” or “whether somebody is about to be arrested”. This is classic misdirection. Nobody is asking for such updates about alleged criminal cases: the question was about Defence’s own efforts to entrench cultural reforms to ensure the many fine personnel of the ADF cannot have their reputations tarnished by the horrific actions of a few. There was no real answer to why he wasn’t giving parliament the updates that Reynolds had promised. Dutton demanded that the Guardian “table” any supporting documentation. Minister, if you happen to find yourself reading this trashy publication, you are welcome to take the above as our response. But more importantly, you are welcome to provide the public with a more comprehensive update on what action you are taking to implement the Brereton report.",News/Australia news,"Confronted about his inaction on the Brereton reforms, Peter Dutton attempts to shoot the messenger",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/when-confronted-by-his-inaction-on-the-brereton-reforms-peter-dutton-attempts-to-shoot-the-messenger
5/5/2022,"Hello and good morning, Joe Biden has warned of new attacks on civil rights as the supreme court prepares to strike down the right to abortion, telling reporters at the White House that LGBTQ+ children could be the next targets of a Trump-dominated Republican party he called “this Maga crowd” and “the most extreme political organisation … in recent American history”. “What happens,” the president said, if “a state changes the law saying that children who are LGBTQ can’t be in classrooms with other children? Is that legit under the way the decision is written?” There are also fears contraception could come under fire next. Biden’s remarks followed the leaked draft of a ruling by Justice Samuel Alito. One of six conservatives on the supreme court, Alito was writing on a Mississippi case which aims to overturn both Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which guaranteed the right to abortion, and Planned Parenthood v Casey, a 1992 ruling which buttressed it. Hundreds rallied again in Washington, DC, to protest against the draft decision, with polling showing the supreme court is out of step with the majority of Americans. Meanwhile, Biden is facing criticism within his own party for seeming reluctant to contemplate changes needed to enshrine abortion rights in legislation: namely abolishing the Senate filibuster, the rule that requires 60 votes for most bills to pass. When will the Mississippi case conclude? It’s expected to be resolved in June. The leaked draft is not final. What will be the immediate impact? More than half of US states will outlaw abortion immediately or as soon as practicable. There are 26 states hostile to abortion, with 13 having passed so-called trigger laws, effectively banning abortion as soon as Roe v Wade is overturned. What can you do? Essayist Rebecca Solnit writes how Americans can fight back to protect abortion rights. Ukrainian forces were fighting “difficult, bloody battles” against Russian troops for a second day, said Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov regiment, as more civilians fled the city of Mariupol on evacuation buses following weeks of brutal bombardment that had reduced much of it to rubble. “I am proud of my soldiers who are making superhuman efforts to contain the pressure of the enemy … The situation is extremely difficult,” Prokopenko said. On Wednesday, David Arakhamia, the head of Ukraine’s ruling party in parliament, told RFE/RL that Russian forces had entered the plant, but he said that the country’s government remained in contact with the Ukrainian troops making a last stand. The Kremlin’s official spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, denied reports that Moscow’s forces were trying to storm the Azovstal plant. Another 344 people had been rescued from besieged Mariupol in a second evacuation operation, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, confirmed a national address. In other developments, Ukraine claimed on Thursday morning it had regained control over several settlements surrounding Mykolaiv and Kherson in the country’s south, military officials said. And an investigation by Associated Press found as many as 600 people were killed in the Russian bombing of a theatre in Mariupol in March, twice as many as once suspected. How are civilians being evacuated from the Mariupol steel plant? Russia has said it will implement a daytime ceasefire for three days from Thursday to allow more civilian evacuations from the Azovstal plant. What further evidence of potential war crimes has emerged? The bodies of 20 more civilians were found in the past 24 hours in the Kyiv region, according to Kyiv’s regional police chief, Andriy Nebytov. What new measures are western leaders taking? The UK said it was providing $56m in funding to help the most vulnerable in Ukraine and at its borders; Biden said he would speak with other G7 leaders about additional sanctions. The European Union is proposing to ban all Russian oil imports. What are Russia and its allies saying? The Kremlin dismissed speculation that it would declare all-out war in Ukraine in the coming days as “nonsense”. Brazilian presidential frontrunner, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said Zelenskiy and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, bore equal responsibility for the war. Donald Trump’s oldest son has met with the congressional committee investigating the January 6 insurrection, according to two people familiar with the matter. Donald Trump Jr was interviewed on Tuesday as the bipartisan House committee moved closer to the former president’s inner circle of family members and political advisers. The younger Trump is of likely interest to the committee because of his proximity to his father on the day of the riot. Donald Trump Jr was seen backstage at the rally on the White House Ellipse that took place shortly before supporters of the then president marched to the Capitol and breached the building. Trump Jr is one of nearly 1,000 witnesses the committee has interviewed as it works to compile a record of the worst attack on the Capitol in more than two centuries. Meanwhile, the justice department has alleged in court papers that a militia group leader tried to ask Trump to authorize them to stop the transfer of power. Stewart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers militia group leader charged with seditious conspiracy over the January 6 attack, asked an intermediary to get Donald Trump to allow his group to forcibly stop the transfer of power. Amber Heard took the witness stand in court on Wednesday in Johnny Depp’s defamation lawsuit against her. “This is horrible for me,” she said. Heard testified to the jury about the first time Depp allegedly hit her, repeatedly. “I’ll never forget it. It changed my life.” The premier of the British Virgin Islands, who is accused of cocaine trafficking, and whom US prosecutors described in court as “corrupt to the core”, has been given a $500,000 bond that would allow him to be released from prison as he awaits trial. Real Madrid staged a stunning late comeback against Manchester City on Wednesday night, progressing to the final of Europe’s top soccer tournament, the Champions League. Karim Benzema’s penalty sunk their opponents. Rescuers in central China have pulled a woman alive from the rubble of a building that partially collapsed almost six days earlier. She is the 10th survivor but potentially dozens are still missing. Oil giant Shell has almost tripled its quarterly profits, as the surge in oil and gas prices drive up earnings and intensify calls in the UK for a windfall tax on excess profits. Around 85% of US plastics end up in landfill, 10% are incinerated, and just 5% to 6% are actually recycled, according to a report by the Last Beach Cleanup (LBC) and Beyond Plastics. That’s compared with recycling rates of 66% for paper and 50% for aluminum cans. The LBC founder Jan Dell said plastic producers had duped consumers by adding triangular “chasing arrows” shapes on to products without actually recycling. “They leveraged the heartstrings of consumers and said this stuff was recyclable.” Dismissed as the work of pranksters, these mysterious flattenings were anonymous, anti-capitalist and awe-inspiring – stunning examples of non-profit art for all, writes Benjamin Myers. Their scale was staggering: at their largest, some designs measured 900ft (270 metres) across, almost as long as the Eiffel Tower is tall. They were completely at odds with the messages being relayed from politicians and businesses in the 1980s: profit at all costs. There are about 11,000 species of bird spanning the globe, but the populations of half of them are falling, while just 6% are increasing and 39% are flat. That’s according to a review published in the journal Annual Review of Environment and Resources. This is due to the destruction of wild habitat, pesticides and other pollution, overhunting and the effects of alien species and disease. Bird populations in the US and Canada have fallen by 3 billion since 1970. I have started getting feelings for my spoons, writes Adrian Chiles. I have 17 wooden spoons. Sorting through them, I realised I do have a favourite. It’s more of a spatula than a spoon, but it suits me very well.

5/5/2022,"Reproductive rights activists across Latin America have vowed to protect hard-fought gains in their own territories as they brace for potential ripple effects if the US supreme court overturns Row vs Wade – the 1973 ruling which guarantees the right to abortion. Latin America has some of the most draconian anti-abortion laws in the world. But feminist movements have fought for decades to chip away at the prohibitions, and in recent years a younger, diverse generation of activists has mobilized in massive numbers to help clinch a string of victories in traditionally conservative countries. Now, the possibility that the US could be moving in the opposite direction has prompted bewilderment, fear and indignation among campaigners from Mexico to Argentina. “The segment of society that wants to return us to the dark ages is real,” said Ana Cristina González Vélez, a Colombian doctor and co-founder of Mesa por la Vida, an organization that was part of the successful campaign for decriminalization of abortion in Colombia. “This has to be a wake-up call, that a legal victory is not a cultural one.” A February ruling by Colombia’s constitutional court – which decriminalized abortion until the 24th week of pregnancy – was the latest in a series of gains by reproductive rights activists. In 2020, Argentina’s marea verde – green wave – protests pushed the country’s congress to legalize elective abortion until the 14th week of pregnancy. Less than a year later, Mexico’s highest court declared a complete abortion ban was unconstitutional – although statutes outlawing abortion are still on the books in most of Mexico’s 32 states. Brazil – where terminations are only allowed in cases of rape, risk to the woman’s life and certain congenital conditions – and Chile are also facing pivotal moments in the fight for legalization. But the importance of Roe vs Wade across the region cannot be overstated, said Debora Diniz, a Brazilian law professor and human rights activist. “In a country that is a political, financial, military empire, a supreme court decision has a contagious effect. Because everything moves together,” said Diniz, who co-founded Anis – Institute of Bioethics, Human Rights and Gender, an NGO pushing for the court in Brazil to decriminalize elective abortion. Argentina was able to secure change through legislation, but the effort took years and has been difficult to replicate in other democracies ravaged by past military dictatorships or still governed by a patriarchal ruling class, she said. “For Latin American countries, like Brazil, like Mexico, like Colombia, the US supreme court was a very important precedent behind the simple idea that courts are a legitimate space in which to decide abortion [rights],” said Diniz. The Mexican lawyer and abortion rights campaigner Melissa Ayala said that the courts in Mexico were strongly on the side of women’s reproductive rights now. But she warned that anti-abortion groups that have been gathering forces in the region will now take a page out of the US playbook. Mariela Belski, executive director of Amnesty International Argentina, agreed. “The threat has been there since the legalization [allowing abortion] was passed,” she said. “We are very worried about the strong anti-rights groups that we are seeing.” Such concerns are all the more pressing because while abortion may be legal in Argentina, access still varies dramatically between regions. Women in Argentina are not prepared to cede any ground, Belski said, adding that they would flood the streets at the first sign of any fresh threat to their legal rights. Her advice to US counterparts was exactly that. “Take to the streets. Mobilize in massive numbers,” she said, and work in a bipartisan way. “I think that the secret in Argentina was the cross-section of legislators who were fighting for the same cause. There wasn’t political division.” Added Diniz: “We have to believe in the green wave. The situation in Latin America was so desperate, and we managed to bring about change.” In several Latin American countries the situation remains desperate: Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador maintain absolute prohibitions in all circumstances, and women have been given long prison sentences even in cases where they suffered miscarriages. In Honduras, the government responded to the growing strength of legalization campaigns by enshrining its total abortion ban in its constitution. “Things couldn’t be worse,” said Neesa Medina, a member of feminist collective Somos Muchas. It was not lost on Medina that the people most affected by an abortion ban in the United States will be the most vulnerable: minorities, migrants, the undocumented. “Latinas,” she added. “There are so many stories that link us as societies. It’s our neighbors, our families, our cousins, aunts, who are going to feel the repercussions directly.” But activists across the region said that their own recent histories offer proof that progress can be fought for. “We’re so used to looking to the United States, but this is a very good moment to look to the south,” said Ayala.",News/Global development,Latin American feminists vow to protect abortion rights at home after shock US ruling,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/05/latin-america-abortion-rights-roe-v-wade
5/5/2022,"“I just don’t know where to go.” Sarah sighed as she looked past her tent off the I-80 highway, at the edge of the San Francisco Bay. Sarah and her partner, Kevin, both 55, have lived in the scattered encampments along this stretch of busy highway in Berkeley, California, for years now. They’ve had to pack up several times, moving from one camp to the next as authorities cleared plot after plot. Last month, a federal judge ruled officials could remove the last remaining tents by 4 May. And Sarah, whose last name the Guardian is withholding because she could face legal barriers to housing, has had to draw on every particle of poise she possesses to keep from falling apart. In many ways, the plight of this encampment is the story of homelessness in California. Its residents have been evicted several times over the past years, disassembling and reassembling their lives each time. Of the dozen or so remaining residents, nearly everyone has health issues that make staying at a temporary shelter difficult or impossible. Many have spent years on waitlists for subsidized apartments but are nowhere near to landing a stable home, often getting lost trying to navigate the labyrinth of social service and health systems available to them. “It’s impossible, even for me,” said Sarah, who briefly worked as a caseworker for unhoused people before she ended up in the encampment herself. “So when they say we have to relocate, where do they expect us to go?” More than 150 people once lived in this cluster of camps along the grey-blue waters of the bay. Over the years, tents and tarps came to dot the islands of dirt in between the highway on- and off-ramps that vibrate with the passing traffic. To access drinking water and electricity, residents make daily, perilous journeys around the tangle of roads. The camps on one side of the freeway have access to a portable toilet, but those on the other don’t. “There’s so much that just goes into, like, survival out here,” Sarah said, squinting through her rectangular, rimless glasses at the spread of camps. She relies on her experience with the Peace Corps, advising her neighbours on how to stay warm and tend to wounds, she said: “Out here, you just feel like you’re hanging on by your fingernails.” Last summer, the state transportation agency, CalTrans, and local authorities began evicting the encampments, first to make way for the construction of an apartment complex, then arguing the remaining tents and their inhabitants were a risk to drivers. When the agency cleared out the camps beneath the underpass in August, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, showed up. Wearing gardening gloves, he dug through the debris alongside CalTrans cleanup crews. “What you see here is unacceptable,” Newsom told news cameras. “This is a high safety risk, a public health risk. There are hundreds and hundreds of rats running around. People should not live in conditions like this and we’ve accepted it too long.” Newsom’s office said that the state was moving people out of the area and into safer housing. About a third of encampment residents moved into shelters or housing, according to the non-profit Where Do We Go Berkeley, which advocated for Sarah and her neighbours in the case against Caltrans. But several residents said they had never heard from caseworkers. And for many of those who did, their disabilities made it all but impossible to live in the congregate shelters or motels that officials were offering. Kevin, who has been unhoused for more than two decades and whose legal name the Guardian is withholding so as not to jeopardise his chance for housing, was offered a place in the emergency shelter near the encampment – a warehouse lined with small tents where individuals and couples could sleep – but he couldn’t accept, he said. He has depressive disorder and other mental health issues including agoraphobia and claustrophobia. “I can’t even get into an elevator if there’s more than two people in it. Being packed in, shoulder to shoulder, with 50 other people would send me into a complete meltdown,” he said. “I get panic attacks. It makes me extremely nervous.” He had been honourably discharged from the navy decades ago, in part due to his mental health issues, but his conditions were exacerbated when his wife died in the mid-90s, he said. “After that, I had no desire to get back into society,” he continued. “Until I met Sarah,” he added. After Kevin declined a spot at the shelter, the couple scarcely heard from local housing services again, Sarah said. So they gathered up what they could carry and moved across the highway on to a secluded patch of land by the Berkeley Marina. Now, they are being evicted again. “They can’t push us any further out of town without us getting our feet wet in the bay,” Kevin said. Alhondro Meyers, 44, who lives next to the couple, said he’d rather struggle at the encampment than struggle with his mental health in a shelter. After he spent four and a half years in prison, where Meyers said faced daily violence from guards, the bunk-style sleeping arrangements and curfew rules at shelters trigger memories from the worst years of his life. “It would be the worst place for me to be,” he said. Out by the marina, Meyers said, he is able to soothe his trauma with long walks or bike trips and by listening to Jill Scott in his headphones. Terry Walker Jr, 45, who had been camping off the I-80 for six years, recently traded in his double mattress set up off the marina for a tiny tent and sparse bedding at the shelter. Sleeping on the floor hurts his broken jaw, and the crowded quarters aggravate his anxiety disorder – making it impossible for him to sleep through the night. All across California, people are facing challenges similar to those of the I-80 campers. The state’s estimated 161,000 unhoused people are disproportionately likely to have physical and mental disabilities – and vice versa. A 2019 report by the University of California, Los Angeles, found that unsheltered people are more than four times as likely as sheltered people to report a physical health condition and nearly one and a half times as likely to report a mental health condition. Across the US, 84% of unsheltered people reported physical health issues, and 78% reported mental health issues. For those with mental health conditions, crowded shelters designed to fit in as many people as possible are often infeasible. Others with physical disabilities and chronic illness may not be able to comfortably navigate or sleep at makeshift congregate facilities. Most temporary housing and shelters across the Bay Area and California are “truly inaccessible to many”, said Margot Kushel, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco and director of the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative. Kushel said that she often hears from shelter operators that the buildings they occupy tend to be older, built before ADA rules were enacted – leaving older, disabled people, including those using walkers and wheelchairs, struggling to navigate the space. Staff at shelters are also often untrained and unaware of the best ways to support people with a range of mental, physical or substance use conditions. “And for many who have been in the justice system, going to a shelter can feel like going back to jail,” she said. “Shelter operators are doing their best, but they don’t really have the resources to provide for people with multiple disabilities,” she said. “They don’t have the physical space, or the staffing.” Even so, housing someone at a shelter costs about $100 a night, or $3,000 a month, she noted. Government agencies also spend millions evicting and clearing encampments. For the 2021-2022 fiscal year, CalTrans was allocated $25m to “clean up encampments”, $20.6m for the removal of hazardous materials from encampments, and an additional $2.7m for “encampment relocation coordination”. “We continue to invest in criminalising homelessness, funding interim measures like shelters, rather than getting to the root of this problem – which is lack of housing,” Kushel said. The governor’s office referred questions to CalTrans. When governments instead invest in shelters and solutions designed more for “people with housing who don’t want to look at the suffering around them, than for those who are actually suffering, we can’t be shocked with the problem isn’t solved,” she added. Encampment residents who were assigned a room via Project Roomkey, a state program launched at the start of the pandemic to get motel rooms for unhoused people, said that regulations at the facilities made it difficult to stay there. Detroit Rodriguez, 46, got a spot at the Rodeway Inn, a Roomkey motel specially designated for people who were “medically fragile” amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But he hardly spends any time there, he said, only stopping in for 30 minutes each day to shower. Rodriguez, who was shot point-blank in the hand and stomach a year and a half ago, has had to use a colostomy bag ever since. On several occasions, especially when he has been out at night diving through dumpsters to collect glass and metals he can trade in for cash at recycling facilities, the bag has ripped open – leaching stomach acids all over his abdomen. “It is excruciating pain,” he said. But the Project Roomkey facility has a strict curfew, and staff has repeatedly refused to allow him back inside after hours, he said, even to clean himself up or get a replacement bag, he said. The leaks have caused skin irritation and infections, which in turn have forced Rodriguez’s doctors to delay his colostomy reversal surgery by months, he said. “They just have no compassion or sympathy over there,” he said. The Alameda county office of homeless care and coordination, which oversees the Roomkey motels, said that it follows up “in all cases where complaints are filed through the hotel or through the providers, including working with management on special accommodations”. Noemy Mena-Miles, a spokesperson for the office, said that the “top priorities for Project Roomkey residents include bridging medical care, linkages to services, and referrals to care in a safe, non-congregate setting”. For Rodriguez, who has also experienced bouts of debilitating depression and post-traumatic stress after being diagnosed with a brain tumour, being isolated from his friends and community at the encampments wasn’t ideal either. Gesturing toward the collection of tents, he added: “Really, you got all these people out here who just hit hard times. And when you fall down, sometimes it’s hard to get back up.” Since last year, only a fraction of encampment residents have found housing. Despite local and state programs that prioritise disabled and medically vulnerable people for housing, it can take years for unhoused people to find a place in a state with a staggering shortage of affordable homes. Kevin has been on a list to receive permanent supportive housing for years. And Sarah, who also has depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and an intestinal condition, is considered among the most vulnerable to complications from Covid-19. But even after more than a decade of living on the streets, neither has gotten any closer to finding a safe, indoor place to live. For some of their former neighbours who have found an apartment or room at a suitable shelter, the process has often boiled down to luck and tireless advocacy by local non-profits and lawyers. “It takes a lot of time to find accommodations and services,” said Andrea Henson, a lawyer with East Bay Community Law Center representing the encampment residents. “And when you do evictions and disperse an encampment, that causes even more delays because it can be hard for us and for caseworkers to find everyone again.” That’s what Henson and other lawyers working with Where Do We Go Berkeley argued in order to secure a preliminary injunction last October, which prevented CalTrans from evicting residents for six months. Many of those living in the area, including disabled and chronically ill people who were at heightened risk for complications from Covid-19, had already been struggling for years to secure housing, the non-profit argued. Pushing people away from their friends and community, and scattering them across the region, would make it even more difficult for them to stay safe and access the health and social services they need. Newsom personally defended the transport authority, arguing the lawsuit had been “preventing CalTrans from delivering on important efforts aimed at revitalising California’s streets and public spaces through litter abatement and local beautification projects”. This April, a federal judge ultimately ruled that the transit agency could carry out the eviction. The unhoused residents living there “are already experiencing homelessness”, the US district court judge Edward Chen ruled. CalTrans “would not be making them homeless through the closure of the encampments.” In a statement last week, CalTrans said it was grateful for the ruling, which would allow it to “maintain the state’s roadway infrastructure for [the] safety of travellers and to ensure people experiencing homelessness are not in unsafe and unhealthy encampments”. Janis Mara, a spokesperson for the agency, also said that CalTrans would continue its work with city and county agencies “to move people out of dangerous encampments and into housing and services” but did not elaborate on how. Encampment residents told the Guardian that they had not received any new offers for suitable shelter ahead of the 4 May eviction. Meanwhile, California lawmakers and the governor are proposing court-ordered treatment for mental health and substance abuse issues as part of the state’s solution to the homelessness crisis. The plan is facing scathing opposition from disability and civil rights groups, who say that the money and resources allocated to such a program should be redirected to providing people with disabilities access to affordable housing. Days before crews were due to clear out their camp, Sarah said she was teetering between tears and rage. She had barely begun to pack all the gear that they had salvaged and accumulated over months and years to survive out by the marina, or think through how the couple might Tetris their bed, their tent, their small solar panel and pots and pans on to the backs of their bikes. “How do I get motivated to pack when I don’t even know where we’re moving?” she said. “I’m just exhausted.” ",News/US news,‘Where do they expect us to go?’ Life at one Bay Area encampment before eviction,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/san-francisco-bay-area-homelessness-encampment
5/5/2022,"Devil House begins with a proposal from true crime author Gage Chandler’s editor: a property is for sale in the California town of Milpitas. Abandoned after a spell as a pornographic book and video shop, it subsequently became the site of a little known, possibly occult double murder. The deadly weapon was a sword, and this was 1987: the peak of the satanic panic, when devil worship was supposedly rife and lurking in the grooves of every heavy metal record. Why doesn’t Gage move in, investigate the murders and write his next book? This sets the stage for the third novel by American musician and author John Darnielle. Like its predecessor, Universal Harvester, Devil House presents as horror but spirals off, with mixed results, in several unexpected directions: it’s a critique of true crime and the impulses that inspire it, a fragmented character study and a metafictional puzzle. This last strand is the most intriguing, landing the novel in an interesting space somewhere between Atonement and the Serial podcast. Darnielle likes obscurity and the gaps between facts, where rumours swell like mushrooms. Devil House brilliantly captures the pre-internet spread of news in the way the Milpitas murders accumulate weird details, especially in school playgrounds: “I heard they lit the bodies on fire. I heard one guy was covered in oil but he didn’t burn. My friend lives near there, he saw the burning bodies. For real? For real. My brother said there was a lady inside whose right leg was twice as long as her left one, she had to drag herself around by her hands.” He evokes a powerful sense of place, too. While Universal Harvester gave an eerie portrait of the abyssal loneliness of Iowa corn country, Devil House lands us in a haunted northern California. The paradise of redwoods and vineyards is nowhere to be found, replaced by depopulated zones around highway exits and suburban front doors hiding bleak domestic cruelties. The book details Gage’s investigation into the killings, which involves imagining himself into the lives of a group of teenage friends who, in the weeks before the murders, transformed the defunct porn shop into their own phantasmagorical kingdom. In these sections the writing is at its most exciting, Gage slipping unexpectedly from the plain, doomy register of true crime into something mock-medieval that conveys the teenagers’ shared dreamworld: “Angela left her shift at the 7-Eleven one evening and got home late. She told her parents that a high school football team had shown up all at once for Slurpees just before closing, and that she’d had to ring them all up individually before she clocked out. None of this was true. She left at eleven on the dot; from work, she drove her mother’s Toyota to Monster Adult X, where she was granted entrance by the keeper of the key. And in that place she was straight away bade good welcome, which welcome she returned with cheer; and behold, in their hidden glade deep within the forest, far from the reach of stern authority, the noble knights did then hold conference …” I loved this part of the book. Elsewhere, I struggled. The medieval flourishes are a bold move for a true crime author and one of the questions Devil House seems to pose is: can Gage Chandler write? A recycled detail suggests not: in an extract from his book about the White Witch case we see the mothers of both murder victims receive phone calls while heating beef stew on the stove. The same detail crops up a third time in Gage’s account of the Devil House murders, when another mother takes a call with “a pot of beef stew bubbling on the stove”. It’s exactly the kind of almost definitely fabricated snippet that certain types of narrative nonfiction trade in, calculated to give a scene the tang of reality. Its repetition – a hack move – underscores the bogus nature of Gage’s accounts. Planted errors like these are fun to uncover. It’s harder to get enjoyment from Gage’s tendency to state the obvious (“Raising a child without a partner is hard enough; if the child in question needs extra care, it’s harder”), and habit of formulating metaphors that cloud more than clarify. Here he describes the effect of violent crimes on small towns: “Communities where these types of crimes occur form bubbles, and the air inside gets humid; when the membrane finally dissolves, people who lived inside emerge with stories they can keep, or tell.” Is this Darnielle inhabiting a bad writer, or just bad writing? What the metaphor means, or why, outside a first draft, anyone might ever be described as taking a big bite of pizza “like a very hungry person” are mysteries I can’t solve. That is, I suppose, appropriate; the most enjoyable elements of Darnielle’s novel are the blank spaces – maddening, but as true as it gets – left in its accounts of Gage, the White Witch case, and whatever really went down in the Devil House.

5/5/2022,"The lighthouse, and the giant’s grave, in Hale village, near Liverpool, may attract many visitors to this Cheshire outpost east of John Lennon airport, but in spring, birdwatchers flock here for a different reason. The juxtaposition of the Mersey coast, saltmarshes, fields, woodlands and nearby Carr Lane Pools, provide welcome stopping off points for weary migrant bird species. First sightings of wheatears in the fields are harbingers of spring. Social media is soon buzzing with reports of buntings, warblers, whinchats, swallows and swifts. Few sites offer an opportunity to see such avian diversity in adjacent habitats. Accessible by car, cycle or public transport, Hale village presents an unmissable spring spectacle.halevillageonline.co.ukJennifer Jones The Dyfi Osprey project based just outside Machynlleth in mid-Wales is a fabulous place where you can watch the resident ospreys, Idris and Telyn, hopefully raise their chicks to migration. You can also learn all about how ospreys have been helped to re-establish themselves in Wales. There is a superb long broadwalk down to a beautiful observatory made from reclaimed wood.dyfiospreyproject.comRachel Mahar We visited Bempton Cliffs RSPB reserve last week and saw puffins aplenty flying in and out of the cliffs, gannets collecting grass for their nests flying alongside the cliffs at head height. There were tales of Albie the albatross but unfortunately we weren’t lucky enough to spot him. We did see a barn owl patrolling the adjacent fields as we left after a wonderful few hours chatting to expert bird spotters at the various viewing platforms, who were all eager to help us novices spot all the different residents. Great fun!rspb.org.ukFreya The Yorkshire Wildlife Trust’s Spurn peninsula and Kilnsea wetland complex is one of the best places to see migrating birds and access is free. A mosaic of wetland, scrub and intertidal areas provide a range of habitats for migrating birds. I make the pilgrimage every year and and usually see my first swallows, martins and cuckoos of the year. Spurn Bird Observatory runs a Twitter feed providing live updates on bird sightings across the complex, revealing locations of incoming migrant birds. The YWT’s new visitor centre has a cafe serving tasty treats and offers “safari” experiences.ywt.org.ukRob Dalziel The extensive reed bed, maintained by the National Trust at Gunwalloe, on the Lizard in Cornwall, is an unappreciated gem for catching sight of migrating birds coming and going. The beaches close by are also a lovely spot to welcome back sand martins returning from Africa and it is often one of the first places in the UK to see swallows returning. The reed bed has recently seen several rarities including a glossy ibis, ring-necked ducks and various warbler species; in the warmer months tales have also been heard of visiting bee-eaters at Gunwalloe. The reed bed also provides regular sightings of marsh harriers and starling murmurations.Layla Astley Having just returned from a fortnight’s holiday in Dumfries and Galloway, we’ve made this often overlooked corner of southern Scotland our go-to for birdwatching areas (and we live in Shetland so have high standards). A huge mix of woodland birds in Galloway forest park, including some firsts for us: species included pied flycatcher, treecreeper, pied (greater spotted) woodpecker, nuthatch and many warbler species. Add to this we took the Red Kite Trail through the forest roads to see hundreds of these magnificent raptors. We also saw nesting osprey at Threave Castle to the south-east of the park and huge numbers of wetland wading species in the coastal estuaries and flats.Dawn Just 20 minutes from Oxford St, you can see a great variety of returning migratory birds at London’s beautiful nature reserve, the Walthamstow Wetlands. The whole protected area is easily reached by underground at Tottenham Hale in zone 3. Birds come to the site to feed around the 10 areas of open water and marshland. Swifts are common in spring and little ringed plovers arrive in spring, too. Much-travelled black-tailed godwits can also be seen and there’s always the chance of seeing a peregrine falcon – be patient and bring some binoculars. Enjoy the circular bird walk, viewing platforms and hiding areas. There are also weekly guided bird walks starting from the tube station in spring.wildlondon.org.comGreta One of my favourite summer migrants is the somewhat obscure whitethroat. A member of the warbler family, they are grey and brown with – no surprise – white throats. Sometimes I just hear their tetchy alarm call or I spot them delivering their frenetic burst of song from the top of a bush or when flitting between cover. On my rural cycle route to Cambridge they are dotted along the hedge at regular intervals. They can be found across the UK, apart from in urban and mountainous areas, favouring hedges and scrubland, and arrive in April from the Sahel, Africa, to breed here.Sharon Pinner  Guardian Travel readers' tips Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

To enter the latest competition visit the readers' tips homepage - Fair Isle is a mecca for birdwatchers, and the great news is you can sail (or fly) there, from Shetland and in the summer from Orkney. Owned by the Natural Trust since 1954, the island lies midway between Orkney and Shetland and is a haven for resident and migratory birds. With an element of adventure to get there, those intrepid enough to meet the challenge will be highly rewarded. With over 391 bird species recorded, this small island has possibly the highest intensity of recorded bird life in the UK. As you stroll around Fair Isle, it is possible to see many rare species – in the past birds associated with far more southerly areas, such as hoopoe and golden oriole, have been recorded here – with more common species in abundance.fairisle.org.ukKhalida An excellent place for watching birds is the Clevedon seafront, including the delightful 1.5-mile Poets’ Walk.

5/5/2022,"As an emergency measure for the pandemic, New York City’s banishment of cars from certain streets saw unexpected space open up for pedestrians, restaurant tables and playing children. A campaign backed by the city’s new mayor now aims to permanently wrest dominance away from vehicles and preserve these new outdoor havens. The alternative vision for America’s largest city demands that 25% of its street space is converted from car use to walkable pedestrian plazas, green space, bus lanes and dedicated cycle paths by 2025. The campaign, called 25x25, has now also been adopted by activists in Los Angeles, an indication of how some Americans are questioning the long-held primacy of cars amid a surge in cycling since the start of the pandemic. Cities should consider a formula of “space minus cars equals quality of life” according to Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives. The group, which is heading the 25x25 campaign, cites the climate crisis, air pollution, the death toll from car crashes and community cohesion as urgent reasons to hand room from cars to people. “If you live in a place where buying a car and spending $10,000 a year on car-related payments is your only way to get around, then your leaders have failed you and your children,” said Harris. “Using streets to simply move and store cars is not optimizing that space. We just got blinded by the car industry and this belief that we should put an SUV in every garage.” With its dense neighborhoods, heavy use of public transport and a majority of households not owning a car, New York City would appear an obvious wellspring for car-free space. And yet three-quarters of street space is given over to cars, according to Transportation Alternatives, with New York’s roads lined with 3m free car-parking spaces, more than one space for every car in the city. Millions of pedestrians have to traverse narrow sidewalks that often are obstructed by the city’s infamous penchant for leaving bags of rubbish for collection by the curb. “Right now, we give most of New York to cars – but imagine if sidewalks were bigger, if you could bike or quickly take the bus anywhere you wanted, if you didn’t have huge mounds of garbage on every single street,” said Harris. “As New Yorkers, we think of ourselves as being tough. But that doesn’t mean we have to live in filth, or that we should fear death or injury every time we cross the street.” The plan, which would create the equivalent space of 13 Central Parks to be used for 500 miles of dedicated bus lanes, 500 miles of protected bike lanes, new secure garbage containers and widespread community use of car-free roads, has been backed by Eric Adams, the New York City mayor who wobbled to work through car traffic on a bicycle on his first day in office in January and has pledged to make the city greener, both figuratively and literally. “These are our streets, and it’s about riding, skateboarding, walking,” Adams said last month as he unveiled a new $900m plan for the city’s 6,300 miles of road to improve intersections and upgrade bike paths and bus lane infrastructure. “You know, this is a good place you could come shop, sit down, spend time, and just enjoy the outdoors,” he said at the announcement at a plaza in Brooklyn.” Campaigners hope to expand and entrench the re-imagining of streetscapes that occurred in the early stanzas of the pandemic in 2020, where temporary barriers were placed on a clutch of streets to block off cars and ensure social distancing for people. The program, called Open Streets, has since blossomed across 150 different locations in New York, bringing a dose of communal European-type city space to previously car-choked streets. “People really embraced the idea, it’s essentially created a park space where people can gather, kids can learn to ride bikes and so much more,” said Carlina Rivera, a New York City council member who introduced the first Open Streets proposal. Rivera is now pushing for the adoption of a “superblock” – a cluster of city blocks where street space is shared and non-resident cars are banned, popularized by Barcelona – in her Manhattan district. “This current imbalance of space isn’t serving us the way it should,” she said. “There shouldn’t be this supremacy of vehicles in a largely pedestrian city whose residents rely heavily on public transit.” Attitudes about transport among New Yorkers can often seem contradictory – the city has one of the largest subway systems in the world and its most walkable, cycle-friendly neighborhoods are the most desirable, and yet car congestion is so bad that the average traffic speed in midtown Manhattan is under 5mph. Congestion pricing has been bitterly fought, and vocal car advocates successfully stymied attempts to ban vehicles from the city’s two great parks, Central Park and Prospect Park, for decades. The Open Streets concept was initially opposed by some restaurants, fearful that removing parking spaces would deter customers. Plans to make permanent the most celebrated of the Open Streets, a one-mile stretch of avenue in the borough of Queens, has been attacked in Facebook posts and via a small protest march by residents who want the cars back. “My daughter sees people drinking and smoking weed,” Gloria Contreras, who co-founded the protest group Resisters United, said in October. “I moved to 34th Avenue because it was a beautiful, quiet residential neighborhood. I never had the issues I have now.” This sort of desire for untrammeled access and space for cars is common across the US. This year, in Texas, a plan by San Antonio to transfer some lane space from cars to bike paths was halted by the state government, while in Florida, Miami passed an ordinance to demand developers build more parking. “This is not a pedestrian and bicycle city,” said Manolo Reyes, a Miami city commissioner. “We don’t have a mass transit system, period.” Parking takes up around a third of land area in US cities, with around eight spaces installed for each car across the country. Joe Biden’s administration has sought to encourage public transport, and even raised the idea of tearing down certain highways, but is still handing out $350bn to the states to upgrade and expand roads for car use. The president, meanwhile, has also championed the adoption of electric vehicles in order to cut planet-heating emissions rather than phase down car use itself. Allies say this is the most expedient climate approach given many Americans’ fixation upon driving increasingly large cars and even 25x25 campaigners concede it will take plenty of time and investment to see a major cultural shift where cars are widely viewed as an equal, or even inferior, transport option to other ways of getting around. “The amount of large SUVs and lights trucks being sold now is unsustainable and deadly. We work with families every day who are simply standing on a bus stop or trying to cross the street and their entire world is destroyed forever,” said Harris.",News/US news,New York banished cars during Covid – could its open streets be preserved?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/new-york-cars-free-covid-open-streets
5/5/2022,"More than half of children’s car seats tested for toxic flame retardants and PFAS contain the dangerous substances, a new report in the US has found. The analysis, conducted by the Ecology Center, an environmental and consumer advocacy group, also found all car seats costing under $100 contained either PFAS or flame retardant, which means lower-income children are more likely to be exposed. Meanwhile, there is “no evidence” the nation’s flammability standards have prevented car seat deaths over the last 50 years, the Ecology Center wrote in its report. “Many car seat companies are creating a hazardous exposure problem to follow a broken regulation,” it added. The study checked more than 600 components on 25 seats manufactured by popular brands in the US and EU, like Graco, Baby Trend and Evenflo. Phosphorus- and bromine-containing flame retardants are linked to developmental disorders, cancer, endocrine disruption, diabetes and other serious issues. PFAS, or per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 9,000 compounds often used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. The chemicals are linked to cancer, thyroid disease, liver problems, decreased immunity, high cholesterol and more. They are known as “forever chemicals” due to their longevity in the environment. The substances can be breathed in or ingested as they break off from the materials that they are applied to, and can also be absorbed by the skin. Overall, 55% of the 22 US seats contained phosphorus-based flame retardant in the upholstery, and nine also contained bromine in the upholstery or foam. Car seats purchased in the EU did not contain phosphorus-based flame retardants, even when the same product sold in the US did. However, several EU seats contained bromine, though that is of lower concern because it is probably in foam that is covered by upholstery. Four seats marketed as water- and stain-resistant contained PFAS, as did two strollers. None of the strollers contained flame retardants. Manufacturers use wool or dense, tightly woven polyester fabric as alternatives to flame retardants, said Melissa Cooper Sargent, Ecology Center’s green living resources director. But it’s difficult for manufacturers to build and sell flame retardant-free seats for under $100 because the chemicals are cheaper than thick polyester fabrics. “Companies are saying, ‘That’s as low as we can go,’” Cooper Sargent told the Guardian. That has forced the Ecology Center to turn its attention to regulations it sees as unnecessary. Cooper Sargent said US flammability rules trace back to cigarette manufacturers that wanted the chemicals used in furniture and car seats to prevent fires started by people dropping cigarettes. The vast majority of modern car fires are started in the engine block, so flame retardants are largely ineffective, Cooper Sargent said. Moreover, the chemicals create a health hazard for firefighters who may inhale the smoke. The EU recently changed its 50-year-old flame retardant standard that was based on US rules. Ecology Center is pressuring legislators and the US Department of Transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg,to follow suit, and is stressing that current rules unfairly expose lower-income kids. The proposal, Cooper Sargent added, has the support of 40 environmental and consumer advocacy groups, as well as the Juvenile Manufacturers Trade Association. “Affordable car seats should come without chemical costs to kids,” the Ecology Center wrote.",News/Environment,Over half of child car seats have toxic flame retardants and PFAS – US study,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/05/us-child-car-seats-pfas-foxic-flame-retardants-study
5/5/2022,"A scientist has started a national investigation into curlews, after noticing in a small-scale study that some of the eggs being laid by the endangered birds were unusually fragile and crumbly. If it emerges that the problem is widespread, the fragile eggs could pose a grave risk to the future of the species which has faced significant declines in Scotland, England and Wales, and an overall UK decline of 42% between 1995 and 2008. Dr Nicola Hemmings, a researcher in the school of biosciences at the University of Sheffield, started working with the Curlew Recovery Partnership (CRP) conservation group last year. She said: “I looked at a very small number of eggs because the CRP thought there might be some fertility issues. All of them were fertilised and showed some sign of embryo development but at least half of them had flaky, brittle or crumbly thin fragile shells. We have this hint there could be a problem here. It’s worth noting that those eggs with particularly thin shells had embryos that died in particularly late development.” This finding worried her, so she decided to ask the partnership to get samples from across the country, to see if it is widespread and if there is any pattern with regard to egg quality and hatching success. Nest monitors have been asked to send failed eggs and egg fragments to Dr Hemmings, who will be analysing them to see why they are becoming so crumbly. “We want to assess what degree this is a threat to the recovery of the curlew,” she said, adding: “The first step is to find out if this issue is widespread, then the next step will be to try to identify what the problem is, so what’s causing the problem with these eggshells. “We will analyse eggshell samples to look for environmental contaminants that might be leading to poor eggshell quality and also look for evidence of poor nutrition.” If they are able to identify a problem, conservation teams could work with landowners in the area to reduce the pollution near curlew sites, or help the birds who aren’t finding enough food. If the issue is inbreeding because of the constricted population, rather than something that is easier to fix, such as environmental pollution, the outlook would be poor. However, there are hopes that another issue may be behind the problem. Hemmings said: “The one thing that did seem quite hopeful from our analysis last year was that the fertility issue didn’t seem to be a massive problem. These eggs were fertilised which is the first thing people think of with respect to genetic or inbreeding problem. Doing this kind of UK-wide assessment will help us identify whether there are any problems with particular pockets across the problem and if there are any fertility issues arising.” It is important that members of the public do not disturb nest sites, but those conservationists involved in the study have been asked to keep an eye out for failed eggs. It is then important to get the eggs in the fridge, before sending them off for analysis. They have also been asked for larger fragments from hatched eggs, to enable analysis of shell thickness at a range of locations. The loss of curlew has been the most dramatic in the lowlands, and birds below Birmingham are now estimated at a maximum of 300 pairs. It is thought these birds could die out in eight years if nothing changes. Curlew were added to the UK red list in 2015. Prof Russell Wynn, who runs the CRP, said: “The UK and Ireland holds a quarter of the world’s breeding curlews, mostly concentrated in upland areas of northern England and Scotland. However, after dramatic declines in recent decades, they are now at real risk of extinction as a breeding bird across Ireland, Wales, and much of lowland England. “In these areas we are seeing existing populations becoming increasingly isolated, and a lack of breeding success means there is a risk that they are now dominated by ageing and potentially infertile birds. This new research project will therefore inform conservation efforts in these areas by identifying causes of egg failure, and potentially also alerting us to impacts of chemical pollutants and/or poor nutrition on curlew breeding and wintering grounds. “There was a recent study that basically showed the biggest kind of block for population recovery in the curlew is the early reproductive stages – the hatching and successful survival of young chicks. Every egg is crucial and every clutch is crucial.”",News/Environment,"Crumbly curlew eggs may pose another threat to species, say UK scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/05/crumbly-curlew-eggs-may-pose-another-threat-to-species-say-uk-scientists
5/5/2022,"The New South Wales government will consider all options to improve regional healthcare after a scathing report found doctors had been operating in a “culture of fear” that was leading to poor outcomes for patients. Speaking after the 322-page report was tabled on Thursday, the state’s regional health minister, Bronnie Taylor, thanked those who gave evidence during the inquiry and said she would spend the next six months going through its recommendations “with a fine-tooth comb”. “The NSW government has listened and accepts that there is a need to do more to improve patient care in regional and rural locations,” she said. “Everything is on the table when it comes to improving health outcomes in rural and regional NSW.” The report made 22 findings and 44 recommendations after hearing from dozens of witnesses and receiving more than 700 submissions about the state of regional, rural and remote medical care in NSW. Chris Minns, the state’s opposition leader, implored the government to “act immediately” on the recommendations, including improvements to healthcare workforce retention plans, palliative care and Indigenous health outcomes and access. “The findings are concerning for those that live outside metropolitan Sydney,” Minns said. Key among the recommendations was greater communication between the state and commonwealth – at a ministerial level – to address issues around funding and responsibilities, with a 10-year plan recommended to ensure an ongoing supply of doctors. Taylor said she was up for the challenge and would work with “whatever government we have” after the upcoming federal election. “People in our community, they don’t care if it’s a state or federal issue, they just want us to sort it out,” she said. She pointed to the recent establishment of the regional health division at NSW Health as part of the government’s efforts to improve outcomes and processes. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, said spending on rural health was at an all-time high but “we could always do better”. But implementing the recommendations and improving health outcomes and access in NSW would only be possible if the state and federal governments increased spending, according to the Australian Medical Association (AMA). The body is calling for an increase, from 45% to 50%, of the commonwealth’s share of funding and for the state to then reinvest the funds freed up. “Without change to the current funding arrangements and a significant commitment between the state and commonwealth governments to work cooperatively to improve rural health, it will be difficult to achieve many of the recommendations outlined by the committee,” said the AMA’s NSW president, Dr Danielle McMullen. The AMA also called on governments to address the need for better workforce planning to deal with understaffing and burnout, and proposed a consideration of incentives and contract flexibility for regional doctors. “The inquiry caused considerable distress to those working in rural and regional NSW, and the focus now needs to be on ensuring that some positives come from this process,” McMullen said. While the inquiry did recommend NSW Health expedite its review of the nursing and midwifery workforce, it did not recommend the introduction of nurse-to-patient ratios, which the NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association (NSWNMA) had argued for. “The urgent implementation of safe staffing ratios is paramount and would help to address these issues,” the NSWNMA’s general secretary Brett Holmes said. One of the recommendations was to establish an independent office of the Health Administration Ombudsman to probe concerns over the conduct of NSW Health and local health district management. This is supported by the Australian Lawyers Alliance, a national group dedicated to justice, freedom and the rights of the individual. “It is essential that there is increased transparency in the system and public access to meaningful data, particularly regarding adverse patient outcomes,” the ALA’s spokesperson and regional health advocate Catherine Henry said. Henry also supported the recommendation that a second inquiry be held in two years to check on the state’s progress, noting it was important the report did not sit in a drawer at Macquarie Street and “gather dust”. The state government has six months to deliver its response.",News/Australia news,"‘Everything is on the table’ to address regional NSW healthcare, minister says after scathing report",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/everything-is-on-the-table-to-address-regional-nsw-healthcare-minister-says-after-scathing-report
5/5/2022,"US officials have reportedly confirmed they are providing intelligence that has helped Ukrainian forces target and kill many of the Russian generals who have died in the Ukraine war. The claim in the New York Times, quoting unnamed defence officials, appears to confirm suspicions the US is supplying actionable intelligence in real time to help the Ukrainian military select high-value targets. Appearing to confirm the claims, the Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, acknowledged the US was providing “Ukraine with information and intelligence that they can use to defend themselves”, although Adrienne Watson, a national security council spokesperson, said intelligence was not provided “with the intent to kill Russian generals”. The acknowledgment of US intelligence assistance in targeting Russian forces, which comes on top of another $20bn (£16bn) in promised weapons to Ukraine from Washington, is a further escalation in what is increasingly becoming a proxy war between the US, with its western allies, and Russian forces in Ukraine. While Moscow has already said it was targeting western arms shipments arriving in Ukraine, it also threatened “lightning fast” retaliation after the UK defence minister James Heappey defended Ukraine striking targets inside Russia. According to the US officials, Washington has given Ukraine details on Russia’s expected troop movements and the location and other information about Russia’s mobile military headquarters, and Ukraine has combined that help with its own intelligence to conduct artillery strikes and other attacks that have killed Russian officers. Ukrainian officials said they had killed about 12 Russian generals on the battlefield. The most recent fatality apparently occurred at the weekend with the reported death of Maj Gen Andrei Simonov, a Russian electronic warfare commander, who Ukraine said it killed near the city of Izyum in the Kharkiv region, which is occupied by Russian forces. Justifying the sharp increase in military assistance to Ukraine last month, the US president, Joe Biden, made it clear Washington wanted to help shape conditions to assist Ukrainian forces in the current phase of the war, as Moscow has pivoted from its failed attempt to take Kyiv to focus on eastern and southern regions of the country. The New York Times reported the Biden administration had sought to keep much intelligence secret to avoid provoking Vladimir Putin into a wider war. That cautious calculation appears to have changed in recent weeks, as countries have voiced overt support for Ukraine and supplied far more lethal equipment, including much-needed artillery and ammunition. Summing up that mood last month, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the US wanted “to see Russia weakened to the degree it cannot do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine”. Boris Johnson, in an address to the Ukrainian parliament earlier this week, framed the fight in Churchillian terms.",News/World news,"US intelligence helping Ukraine kill Russian generals, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/us-intelligence-helping-ukraine-kill-russian-generals-report
5/5/2022,"Andy Murray will not get the chance to test himself against his oldest rival, Novak Djokovic, for the first time since 2017 after he was forced to withdraw from their third round match at the Madrid Open after suffering from illness. It is a tough blow for Murray, who officially withdrew just over an hour before the pair had been scheduled to compete as the first match on Court Manolo Santana at 12pm in Madrid on Thursday. It would have marked their first match in more than five years and their 37th overall. Having spent the previous four weeks in a training block after officially rekindling his partnership with coach Ivan Lendl, Murray had set up the match-up with Djokovic by playing some of his best tennis of the year, defeating Denis Shapovalov, the 14th seed, in the second round for his first top 20 win of the year. Afterwards, Murray’s excitement about facing Djokovic was palpable. “He’s the world No 1 and I’ve got a metal hip,” Murray said. “I didn’t know I’d get opportunities to play matches like this again. In theory I shouldn’t have a chance in the match. But I’ve worked my hardest, put myself in a great position and it’s a fantastic opportunity to play against him again on a big court in a huge tournament.” With this new setback, Murray now must hope to recover over the next few days in order to compete at the Italian Open, another Masters 1000 event that follows Madrid. Murray has currently entered the qualifying draw in Rome, which begins this weekend. Murray currently does not plan to compete at the French Open over best of five sets. Despite receiving a walkover into the quarter-final, Murray’s withdrawal is also unwelcome news for Djokovic himself who is looking for as many matches as possible in order to improve his level after missing most of the first three months of this season due to his unvaccinated status. Djokovic will next face Hubert Hurkacz, the 12th seed, or Dusan Lajovic in the quarterfinal.",Sport/Sport,Andy Murray misses Novak Djokovic showdown in Madrid after illness,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/05/andy-murray-misses-novak-djokovic-showdown-in-madrid-after-illness
5/5/2022,"The visit of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Kyiv at the head of a congressional delegation this week was a reminder that in Washington the Ukraine war is not just an issue of national security but is an increasingly important domestic political issue too. In his approach to the conflict, Joe Biden, has the wind at his back in terms of US public opinion and Democratic party sentiment which is encouraging him to be ever more forward-leaning. In a new poll conducted by the Washington Post and ABC News, 37% of Americans questioned said his administration was not doing enough to support the Ukrainians, fractionally more than the 36% who said he was doing the right amount. Only 14% suggested he was doing too much. Late last month, the administration broadened US objectives in the conflict, to not just support Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity but also to weaken Russia, with the aim of preventing a repeat of Moscow’s aggression against other countries. A European diplomat suggested that one of the factors behind that shift was impatience in the higher levels of the party with the administration’s posture. “It’s fundamentally about trying to get on the front foot in this crisis. There’s a lot of domestic criticism of the administration for being so passive,” the official said. “The Hill [Congress] are cross and a lot of the big Democratic donors think it’s not being as forthright as America should be … Biden thinks he’s treading a careful path between intervention in its broader sense and keeping the focus on domestic concerns – and some Democrats are starting to think that balance isn’t right.” Senator Chris Coons, a senior figure in Democratic foreign policy circles, has criticised Biden for taking direct military intervention off the table as an option. On the other side of the party, there has been little pushback from the progressive wing, which is normally sceptical about sending large quantities of military hardware into foreign conflicts. And for once in Washington, the Republicans are pushing in the same direction. “This is one of the few areas where Democrats and Republicans are reasonably well united and that makes it pretty easy for a president to move in that direction. He’s not making enemies,” said Larry Sabato, politics professor at the University of Virginia. “The umbrella over all of this is the moral issue and the powerful video of Ukrainians being slaughtered and dislocated,” John Zogby, a pollster and political consultant, said. “Americans are moved by that and overwhelmingly support the Ukrainian people.” It is nonetheless a political wedge issue. Support is more uniform among Democrats than Republicans. Donald Trump transferred his personal admiration for Vladimir Putin to at least some of his followers and the Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, who has consistently raised pro-Moscow talking points on his show. Democratic support is deepened by the important role of Ukrainian-Americans, thought to represent about 1 million people (Zogby thinks that is an underestimate) and who are influential on the party’s ethnic coordinating council. They have all the more sway because they are concentrated in swing states. “You’ve got a decent number of Ukrainians in Ohio, and you have a Senate race in Ohio. There are Ukrainians in Pennsylvania and you have a Senate race in Pennsylvania,” said Wendy Schiller, political science professor at Brown University. In Wisconsin, Democrats have been running ads against the incumbent Senator Ron Johnson, focusing on his 2018 visit to Moscow. “It’s not an accident that Nancy Pelosi went to Ukraine,” Schiller said. “To have the speaker go, it says this is going to be an issue that the national party is going to take into the midterm elections.” With state-level and national politics, moral outrage among the public and Biden’s own foreign policy instincts, all pointing in the same direction, the administration has sharply raised its stake in the Ukraine conflict, asking Congress for an extraordinary $33bn in military, economic and humanitarian support for Kyiv. Public support, however, dies away dramatically when it comes to the question of sending US troops. Only 21% asked in this week’s poll backed such direct intervention, and concern about Ukraine escalating into a nuclear conflict is significantly higher among Democrats than Republicans. Biden, who has made extricating the US from “forever wars” his signature foreign policy, has repeatedly said he will not send US troops into Ukraine, and has cancelled routine missile tests to reduce any risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation between the two nuclear superpowers. “Boots on the ground may very well be a very different story,” Zogby said. “I don’t think world war three polls very well.”",News/US news,Why the Ukrainian war is also a domestic political issue for Biden,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/ukrainian-war-biden-policy-polling
5/5/2022,"The UK faces a mini-heatwave from next week, with above normal temperatures steadily climbing to as high as 22C or 23C in the south later in the month, meteorologists predict. Sunny and dry conditions will prevail in the south after an April during which average maximum temperatures were generally above normal and the UK had about a third less rain than usual. It is set to turn warmer over the next few days as high pressure sweeps across the UK, with temperatures of up to 21C in southern England on Thursday and about 17C as far north as Aberdeen in Scotland. Temperatures will drop slightly on Friday, although they could reach 20C in southern and eastern England with the weekend set to be dry and warm as high pressure dominates. BBC weather said the jet stream running across the UK early next week would result in wind and rain in the north and showers in the south-east, but it would still be warmer than usual for the time of year. By midweek, there is the potential for very warm weather in the south, possibly nudging into the mid-20Cs. The Met Office forecast is for widespread settled weather next week, with any rain confined to western and northern areas: “Temperatures are likely to rise above average through the first few days, except nearer to the coast and perhaps the far north, which may see slightly cooler conditions, and it is expected to become warm, perhaps very warm, later in the period.” A heatwave is defined as three consecutive days or more of a certain temperature threshold being reached or exceeded. There will be a change moving into the second half of May, with more unsettled conditions bringing spells of rain or showers. “Drier spells are also likely, particularly in the south, as is typical for late spring. Temperatures will continue to be above average, especially in the south where it could be very warm early in the period. Further north a return to near normal conditions is possible later in the month,” said the Met Office. Temperatures are “several degrees above where they should be at this time of year”, according to Marco Petagna at the Met Office. The UK’s hottest day so far this year was Good Friday, when 23.4C (74F) was recorded in St James’s Park in central London.",News/UK news,Mini-heatwave set to hit UK with temperatures up to 23C,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/05/mini-heatwave-set-to-hit-uk-with-temperatures-up-to-23c
