2/21/2022,"The latest blow to the Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway golf tour has been delivered by Dustin Johnson, who has pledged commitment to the sport’s existing ecosystem. Johnson joins Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm, Tiger Woods, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth and Collin Morikawa by stating support for the PGA Tour. Against such high-profile resistance, it appears highly doubtful that the Saudi scheme, which is fronted by Greg Norman, can proceed in meaningful fashion.  Saudi’s plans for golf have been hugely controversial given the kingdom’s human-rights record and reported involvement in the 2018 murder of a journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. Players had been tempted by huge financial incentives to join a Super Golf League. Johnson’s position is interesting because he was known to be a key target for the Saudis. In a statement, tellingly released by the PGA Tour, the world No 6 said: “Over the past several months, there has been a great deal of speculation about an alternative tour, much of which seems to have included me and my future in professional golf. I feel it is now time to put such speculation to rest. “I am fully committed to the PGA Tour. I am grateful for the opportunity to play on the best tour in the world and for all it has provided me and my family. While there will always be areas where our Tour can improve and evolve, I am thankful for our leadership and the many sponsors who make the PGA Tour golf’s premier tour.” Attention now turns firmly towards Phil Mickelson. The current US PGA champion recently lambasted the “obnoxious greed” of the PGA Tour. A subsequently released interview with Mickelson implied he had been actively working with the Saudis in a bid to earn leverage against the PGA Tour. “We know they killed Khashoggi and have a horrible record on human rights,” Mickelson was quoted as saying by a biographer. “They execute people over there for being gay. Knowing all of this, why would I even consider it? Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates. “They’ve been able to get by with manipulative, coercive, strong-arm tactics because we, the players, had no recourse. I’m not sure I even want [the SGL] to succeed but just the idea of it is allowing us to get things done with the PGA Tour.” Mickelson’s comments are known to have angered fellow players. It remains to be seen how the Tour will respond. Saudi’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, has denied ordering Khashoggi’s killing in Istanbul. However, a report published by the UN in June 2019 concluded that Khashoggi “has been the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution, an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible under international human-rights law”.",Sport/Sport,Dustin Johnson delivers new blow to Saudi-backed breakaway tour,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/20/dustin-johnson-delivers-new-blow-to-saudi-backed-breakaway-tour
2/21/2022,"Dean Richards, the Newcastle director of rugby, could not hide his frustration after Callum Chick was sent off during the first half before Exeter pilfered the points late on to move ominously towards the play-off places. Chick, the Falcons captain and No 8, was shown a red card by the referee Christophe Ridley in the 25th minute for a high shot on Josh Hodge, Exeter’s erstwhile Newcastle full-back. Richards queried the haste with which the officials decided that Chick’s shoulder had made contact with Hodge’s head, arguing that the offence warranted no more than a yellow card. Newcastle fought valiantly with 14 men and were on course for a famous victory until the closing stages when the Exeter captain, Joe Simmonds, kicked a penalty to win it.  Richards, the former England captain said: “Josh Hodge clearly dropped his height. “One of the issues we’re having at the moment is they’re trying to get to a really quick decision, rather than the correct decision. “I would have accepted a yellow card, but you can’t make such a critical decision in such a big game as this, as quickly as they did. I thought it was really poor from them. You need to take the time to make the decision correctly, but they don’t want to spend time on TMO decisions. When you’re playing with people’s livelihoods and careers, you can’t do that.” Rob Baxter, the Exeter director of rugby, said: “It’s not about whether it’s an accident or not. It’s a matter of contact to the head and it gets dealt with that way.” Defeat felt cruel on Newcastle on an emotionally fraught afternoon at a bitterly cold, windswept Kingston Park. Before kick-off, the retiring club legend Mark Wilson was introduced to the crowd and was given a rapturous reception as he walked across the pitch with his children, son Zach and daughter Ella. The passing of Steve Black, the hugely popular former Falcons coach, sports psychologist and mentor to Jonny Wilkinson and Danny Cipriani, was also marked. As an image of the man universally known as Blackie was shown on Kingston Park’s big screen, the stadium announcer said: “Blackie, you were a true one-off, a north-east sporting legend who will never be forgotten.” Intriguingly, among the crowd was a sizeable contingent from the Argentinian club Champagnat’s Under-19 side, who are on tour in England. They took up a block of seats in the West Stand and sang their songs with gusto, supporting Exeter’s former Falcon Santiago Grondona, who hails from the same area near Buenos Aires. Newcastle opened the scoring in the 23rd minute when Will Haydon-Wood seized on an errant Exeter offload and showed impressive pace to race 80 metres inside the left channel to cross the line, outpacing Hodge en route. Kingston Park erupted and Haydon-Wood then did superbly well to boot the conversion from close to the touchline. Two minutes later, though, Hodge fielded a high bomb in midfield and was caught high by Chick, who was shown a red card after consultation with Claire Hodnett, the television match official. Exeter sought to capitalise on their numerical advantage and went close when Hodge grubbered into the left corner for Tom O’Flaherty, who could only knock on just yards from the line. But as the interval approached, the Chiefs were not to be denied. A scrum penalty led to Baxter’s team kicking to the left corner for a lineout five metres out and from the subsequent maul Patrick Schickerling emerged from a thicket of bodies to barrel expertly over the line. Simmonds applied the conversion to level matters at 7-7 at half-time, when Hodge was replaced at full-back by Facundo Cordero. Exeter began to dominate territory and three minutes into the second half they scored again when Jack Innard finished off from a lineout rolling maul inside the right channel. Simmonds could not convert but Newcastle roused themselves and hit back with a second try of their own in exhilarating fashion as the hooker George McGuigan charged over the line from close range after excellent work from George Wacokecoke and Matias Orlando. After Simmonds’s late penalty handed Exeter victory, Baxter said: “Over four games now, we’ve collected 12 points and are up to fifth. That shows you how important today was.”",Sport/Sport,Joe Simmonds kicks Exeter to dramatic late win over battling 14-man Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/20/newcastle-exeter-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
2/21/2022,"The only Black Republican in the Senate, Tim Scott of South Carolina, has indicated a willingness to be Donald Trump’s running mate should the former president mount another White House campaign.  Asked by Fox News if he would consider joining a Trump ticket in 2024, Scott said: “Everybody wants to be on President Trump’s bandwagon, without any question.” The remark prompted criticism, in light of Trump’s long history of incendiary rhetoric on race. Mehdi Hasan, an MSNBC host, listed some examples when he wrote: “Shithole countries, go back to where you came from, very fine people, white people don’t get vaccines, stand back and stand by … none of it matters to Tim Scott.” Scott, 56, is widely seen as a contender for the Republican nomination itself, though most observers think it remains Trump’s for the taking. The former president is free to run after Republicans, including Scott, voted to acquit in his second impeachment trial, for inciting the deadly Capitol attack. Tensions between the party establishment and Trump supporters have increased, particularly after the Republican National Committee called Trump’s lie about election fraud and the attack on Congress it fueled “legitimate political discourse”. On Sunday, Scott told Fox News: “One of the things that I said to the president is he gets to decide the future of our party and our country because he is still the loudest voice.” On Saturday, the Washington Post ranked its top 10 contenders for the Republican nomination. Trump was first, Scott sixth. Pointing to the South Carolinian’s aggressive fundraising, the paper said Scott was “raising huge money – $7m last quarter – for something which should, by all accounts, be a pretty sleepy re-election race. He’s also doing something lots of presidential candidates do before running: release a book.” The paper made the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, second-favourite. The former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador Nikki Haley was third, former vice-president Mike Pence fourth and Donald Trump Jr fifth. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was seventh, Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin eighth, New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu ninth and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo 10th. Scott said: “What I hope happens is that we rally around the principles that lead to our greatest success. I am not looking for a seat on a ticket at this point. I am however looking to be re-elected in South Carolina. “So my hope is that you win next Friday’s football game before thinking about any other one. So that’s my primary responsibility.”",News/US news,"Tim Scott, only Black Senate Republican, hints he could be Trump running mate",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/20/tim-scott-black-senate-republican-trump-fox-news
2/21/2022,"This was an afternoon of blood and roses in Yorkshire, a fun, bruising, furious mess of a game. Midway through the second half there was an interlude where six players joined in a kind of rolling, whirling maul close to the centre circle, bodies entwined like a multicoloured octopus writhing on the quayside, the ball punted, thrashed, semi-forgotten. At times Manchester United almost seemed to get a hold on the day, to take the air out of this fury, only for a misplaced pass or a splash of the sodden pitch to leave them chasing back once again. But by the end it was an afternoon that seemed to offer something else too, a significant note in this ongoing, oddly fraught United mini-era.  There had been strange noises around the red side of Manchester all week, whispers and groans, the sense of something rotten in the state of Ralf Rangnick. Nothing was resolved here. A rousing 4-2 win offered three more points en route to the season-saving goal of place in the Premier League. But it felt like a purging experience all the same. This is a clattery metal hanger of a ground, the corrugated stands creating a uniquely footballing sound, like the tonal quality on a vinyl LP. At times that shared energy seemed to spill from the stands into the pitch, lines blurring as goals were scored, intruders wrestled by stewards, objects thrown. It was wild out there, a wild fixture on a wild afternoon at a wild moment in time. In the middle of all this, it was also a very good game for Jadon Sancho, who has begun to find himself here in recent weeks. Starting on the right, Sancho was neat, effective and constantly involved. He grew more assured as the game went on. He made more dribbles and had more passes in the attacking third than any other player. Sancho is like this at his best, a relentless source of pressure, with the skill to produce his own bespoke little moments of skill and incision. Wind him up and let him go: he really should be nothing but an asset to this team. He also gave the final pass for two of the goals, although on both occasions others played a larger part in breaking Leeds open. Sancho is also still only 21 years old, an itinerant presence who has never played in an occasion quite like this, but still produced his best game at United. It felt like a block to build around. Not to mention an interesting point of comparison with Paul Pogba, who started in a risky-looking midfield due with Scott McTominay. In his hour and a bit on the pitch Elland Road witnessed a perfect running tableau of Pogba-ism, a rounded picture of inalienable strengths and inalienable weaknesses. Some will point to his almost total disappearance as Leeds came back to make it 2-2, a man suddenly doing a very slow cross-country jog in the middle of a rain-sodden football match. But Pogba was also United’s main source of incision early on. At times he looked like the only person “playing football” in the middle of all that blunt and necessary energy. Pogba lost the ball, misplaced 40% of his passes, was rolled like a revolving door in the centre circle and left face-down in the mulch. But he kept getting up. And he did the two best things in the opening half hour. First he produced an opportunity so beautifully gift-wrapped it seemed to glimmer with spangles and rolled ribbons, standing up against Adam Forshaw, leaning one way, feinting back, then gliding into open space. The cross found a route through Diego Llorente’s legs only for Illan Meslier to produce a sublime one-handed save as Cristiano Ronaldo scuffed his connection. A few minutes later Pogba did it again, wriggling and bouncing away from two white shirts in the tiniest of spaces, like a man getting changed in a telephone box, then laying on a nudged pass for Bruno Fernandes to shoot. From the corner that followed Harry Maguire opened the scoring, holding off Forshaw and butting the ball into the net. Fernandes scored United’s second in stoppage time. Victor Lindelöf spotted a huge open space and simply galloping forward. His pass found Sancho with time to hang a cross up for Fernandes to nod home almost inside the six yard box. Leeds were energised at the start of the second half. Rodrigo pulled one back. At which point Pogba decided to calm things by playing a simple short pass into Fernandes 45 yards from goal. This wasn’t that day, that game, that place. The ball stopped on the marshy grass and was duly stolen from Fernandes’ toe, leaving him in a wailing heap as Dan James’ cross was turned in by Raphina. With 70 minutes gone it was 3-2. Fred provided the finish, snaking in behind Sancho to take his elegant little lay off, then spanking the ball in from a sharp angle. Anthony Elanga added a fourth. And in that final 20 minutes there was something else, a rare sense of grace for this cut-and-shut team, crammed with oddities, pressed-men, monuments to managers past. Faced with this obstacle, Ralf’s United, a place of schisms and cliques, had produced something coherent and spirited. This was the real beauty of an occasion that felt at times like a trip into some rousing and deeply stylised version of the footballing past. Whatever the systemic issues, the weird structures, the sharp commercial teeth driving this club, the game still gets in at the edges. With Sancho beginning to bloom, this short-lived United team will feel it has something that passes for momentum.",Sport/Football,Manchester United’s wild win at Leeds offers something to build on | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/20/uniteds-wild-clash-with-leeds-shows-they-have-something-to-build-on
2/21/2022,"Dreaming is for free, as someone round these parts once said, and Daniel Podence’s second-half winner means Wolves are now two points behind fifth place in the Premier League with two games in hand and both Arsenal and West Ham United, the two teams immediately above them, to play away this coming week. The Molineux die-hards were blasting out their song about following the Wanderers around Europe again even as Leicester piled on the pressure in the closing stages, Kasper Schmeichel coming up for a corner. But Wolves, having taken the lead through Rúben Neves before Ademola Lookman equalized, held on to reclaim seventh place. No team have won more Premier League games in 2022 than Wolves and, crucially, they have only lost once in the 52 league games in which they have taken the lead since winning promotion four years ago.  Leicester played well enough, and created enough chances to have won, but they are now winless in six domestic matches, their worst run since the latter days of Claude Puel’s reign three years ago. After all their recent woes, Leicester soon found themselves tasked with achieving something no team have managed against Wolves this season: winning after trailing. On the 12 previous occasions they had taken the lead, Bruno Lage’s team had won 11 times and drawn once. So Neves’ superb opener in the ninth minute gave Wolves the kind of platform they relish. The Portugal playmaker, in the form of his life, pinged a sweet crossfield pass out to Podence. When his cross was unconvincingly cleared by Daniel Amartey and Leander Dendoncker headed the ball back inside, Raúl Jiménez was allowed time to tee up Neves whose unerring first-time shot from just outside the penalty area Schmeichel could only help on into the corner of the net. This was Wolves’ first goal against Leicester in six Premier League meetings and, with the fifth best defensive record in Europe’s top five league, Leicester looked there for the taking at this stage. Yet apart from the visitors suffering from the heebie-jeebies every time Wolves had a corner, Leicester thoroughly deserved to be level by half-time. The number of dangerous balls they fed across the face of goal was a constant source of concern for the home team, who were guilty of sitting too deep. Lookman fed Marc Albrighton whose low centre eluded José Sá and needed clearing by Conor Coady, sliding in on the wet surface. Sá parried rasping efforts from Youri Tielemans and Patson Daka and, while Rayan Ait-Nouri almost made it 2-0 when he slammed wide an effort after brilliant work by Podence down the left, Leicester battled their way back to parity. There were five yellow cards flashed in the nine minutes just before the equaliser, with neither team willing to hold back despite a waterslide of a pitch made extremely zippy by a pre-match deluge of biblical proportions. The goal came from exactly the source Leicester had been mining since going behind. Tielemans played an exquisite through ball in between Romain Saïss and Ait-Nouri and Albrighton played the perfect low cross again, for Lookman to speed in and convert his sixth goal of the season. It was only the second time in 16 games Wolves had conceded a first-half goal. Brendan Rodgers was celebrating in the 62nd minute so much did it appear Leicester had taken the lead. Again the danger came from out wide, Lookman crossing from the left behind the backtracking Wolves defence for Tielemans to take the ideal first touch back inside only to then curl his left-footed shot just over. Yet it was when Rodgers’ team were clearly on top that Wolves regained the lead midway through the second half. For once when a Leicester attack broke down, Wolves had players the offensive side of the ball and Ait-Nouri did well to tease Ricardo Pereira to make inroads down the left. Dendoncker squared the ball along the edge of the penalty area where Podence, second touch, shotlow into the bottom corner. There was a VAR delay to check that Schmeichel’s view had not been compromised by Jiménez’s presence before Wolves could complete their celebrations which were enhanced when Pedro Neto came on for the final 10 minutes after a year out with a broken kneecap.",Sport/Football,Daniel Podence on target to sink Leicester and keep Wolves in hunt,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/20/wolves-leicester-premier-league-match-report
2/21/2022,"In the lead-up to Cop26 in November, Boris Johnson was at his most panglossian as he extolled the economic benefits of the country’s transition to net zero. “The UK’s path to ending our contribution to climate change,” the prime minister forecast, “will be paved with well-paid jobs, billions in investment and thriving green industries … by moving first and taking bold action, we will build a defining competitive edge in electric vehicles, offshore wind, carbon capture technology and more.” Back in the real world, matters stand rather differently. Far from forging ahead of the rest, Britain risks falling behind in the new industrial revolution, as latest figures from the Office for National Statistics make depressingly clear. The green economy more or less flatlined between 2014 and 2020, the ONS found. Employment in the low-carbon and renewable energy sectors – which include manufacturing, energy supply and construction – actually fell. This dismal state of affairs predated the Covid pandemic and the accompanying recession.  The present administration cannot be blamed for the poor performance of its Tory predecessors, but it is signally failing to learn from their mistakes. Windy rhetoric is not enough. To a far greater extent, the state must play a strategic role in shaping and investing in the green economy. In the renewable energy sector, a reliance on importing turbines and other components means that too many of the well-paid “green-collar” jobs to which Mr Johnson refers are located abroad. Similarly, the government’s instinctive aversion to state intervention has led to a failure to properly invest in a green future for the steel industry. Green steel will be fundamental to a net zero economy, but as Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Port Talbot, has pointed out, other countries are leaving the UK behind in the race to modernise. A national retrofit programme is urgently needed to increase energy efficiency in people’s homes. But the government’s reluctance to adequately pump-prime a nascent market means another chance to secure good jobs linked to the green transition is being squandered. Sadly, the government’s ideological direction of travel is towards less, not more, intervention. As Mr Johnson attempts merely to survive in office following partygate, influential sections of his party are determined to force his administration to adopt a still more laissez-faire approach. Last week, the prime minister’s new chief of staff, Stephen Barclay, suggested that in the wake of the pandemic, it was time to for the government to “step back” from people’s lives. The Treasury’s determination to rein in public spending post-Covid signals that necessary green subsidies and investment will not be forthcoming, and the cost-of-living crisis is being used by Conservative backbenchers such as Steve Baker to present the green agenda as an expensive imposition on the less well-off. Welcome developments, such as £100m of government money for a car battery manufacturing startup in Blyth, are too small-scale and too ad hoc. Last week’s ONS report must be a wake-up call. An enormous opportunity risks being wasted through a combination of misplaced ideology, blinkered short-termism and lack of strategic imagination and ambition in Whitehall. In the parts of the country that suffered most from ruthless and precipitate deindustrialisation in the 1980s, the path to net zero can be a catalyst for renewal. The state, the private sector, trade unions and local communities can deliver this by working together. But only if the scale of Johnsonian rhetoric is matched by deeds.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Britain’s green economy: seriously underpowered | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/the-guardian-view-on-britains-green-economy-seriously-underpowered
