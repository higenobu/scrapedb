1/24/2022,"The Murugappan family from Biloela has won a court challenge against the immigration minister’s decision effectively barring them from reapplying for bridging visas. Alex Hawke’s move to revoke a decision allowing three family members to reapply for a visa was procedurally unfair, the federal circuit court’s judge Heather Riley held on Monday.  In late June Hawke granted three-month bridging visas to parents Nades and Priya and their daughter Kopika, so they could live in community detention in Perth while the youngest daughter, Tharnicaa, received medical treatment after being evacuated from Christmas Island. On 15 June, the Department of Home Affairs wrote to the family advising them Hawke proposed to “lower the bar” in immigration law, which would then prevent three of the members of the family – Nades, Priya and Kopika – from reapplying for bridging visas. It gave the family until the close of business on 22 June to make submissions. The family’s lawyer, Carina Ford, made a submission to the department at 5.45pm AEST on 22 June, but it was disregarded because it was sent after 5pm and the email address wasn’t being monitored at the time. In September the family’s visas were extended again pending a decision over whether Hawke had afforded the family procedural fairness; the three now have bridging visas to December 2022. Tharnicaa has not received a bridging visa, and is subject to an order requiring her to live in community detention. Judge Riley found that the minister or his adviser were still working on the case at 7.21pm, when they sent the revocation to Ford, and therefore the submission should have been taken into account. “Whatever ‘close of business’ might mean in general, it must have meant at least 7.21pm for the Department of Home Affairs on 22 June 2021,” she said. Riley concluded it was “legally unreasonable” for the minister not to take into account “submissions that had been sent to his department, at the nominated email address, within the time specified in the invitation to comment”. “He thereby denied the applicants procedural fairness.” When proposing to revoke the decision lifting the bar, Hawke told the Biloela family that the critical issue was to align the position of Nades, Priya and Kopika with Tharnicaa. But Riley said that “cannot have been the critical issue, because, if alignment was the objective, it would have made more sense for the bar to be lifted in respect of the younger child, as that would have required only one decision to be made, instead of three”. “Moreover, alignment, or sameness for the sake of sameness, is not a rational basis for making a migration decision.” Riley found that the revocation was “based on some other critical issue, which the Minister has not made known to the applicants or the court”. The judge held that by failing to identify the critical issue on which the decision was based, the minister “thereby failed to afford the applicants procedural fairness”. The court ordered that Hawke’s decision revoking the lift of the bar be quashed, and for Hawke to pay the family’s costs. The decision, while a procedural win for the family, does not prevent Hawke from remaking a decision against the family on their right to reapply for visas. Ford told Guardian Australia the case “may not change the status quo” for the family, because Tharnicaa is still subject to a community detention order.

1/24/2022,"A resident of the remote community of Yuendumu, who is caring for a toddler and a partner on dialysis, is pleading with the Northern Territory government to provide a local quarantine facility, after her Covid-positive elderly relative was forced to sleep outside on the veranda and spend three days under a tree in order to safely isolate from the rest of the family. The Warlpiri woman, who has asked not to be named, says she is “stressed and worried” that her child and partner remain exposed to the virus while the relative remains in their care. She says communication with health officials has left her confused about whether her relative will be sent to quarantine elsewhere or asked stay at home.  “There should be a quarantine place somewhere in Yuendumu,” the woman says. “Positive people have been staying in their houses, in every house in Yuendumu, that’s how the spread went really fast.” The woman suggested vacant homes in town, or local public facilities, could be used for quarantine to take pressure off families whose homes are overcrowded, and where positive people are sharing the one bathroom or kitchen. In one Yuendumu home, it has been reported, 23 people are sharing the facilities. “It’s to keep the community and houses safer. That way we don’t have to be stressing out and frustrated, keeping positive people in our yard,” she says. NT Health has been contacted for comment, to clarify the policy for managing Covid in remote communities, including under what circumstances people are being asked to remain at home, and the criteria are for removing remote residents to quarantine facilities. Last week, leaked minutes of the Yuendumu local emergency health response group – made up of NT police, health workers and key community organisations – expressed concern that the “urban model” of managing Covid at home was not working in the community. “It appears that the outbreak cannot be contained by using the tools (targeted testing) and practices (quarantine/lockout/living with Covid) in place. An approach that is not working for the community and more fit for an urban mainstream environment,” the minutes of the 17 January meeting said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Need to have an honest and transparency [sic] that it is not working and because of that it is placing everyone at risk. Futile to keep supporting an urban model.” On Friday Yuendumu recorded 12 new Covid cases, bringing to 53 the total number of active cases in a population of about 750 people.",News/Australia news,Elderly woman forced to isolate under a tree in remote community due to lack of facilities ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/elderly-woman-forced-to-isolate-under-a-tree-in-remote-community-due-to-lack-of-facilities
1/24/2022,"Children aged 12 or over should be allowed to receive a Covid vaccine without the consent of their parents, leading ethicists and paediatricians say, while also calling for clearer national guidelines on the issue. John Massie, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Melbourne and a child bioethicist, said in a podcast published by the Medical Journal of Australia and in an accompanying piece co-authored with other experts that if those aged 12 and up “have the capacity to understand the nature of the illness … and the procedure and the side effects and the risks, then they should be able to give consent”.  “Our clinical experience has been that some young people are motivated to receive a Covid‐19 vaccine, even when their parents do not wish for them to be vaccinated,” the authors wrote. “How vaccine providers should respond to this request has not been clear.” Traditionally, parents have been asked to consent to vaccinations of their children, including those in high school, with vaccine providers “usually reluctant to vaccinate, fearing legal consequences or complaints against them” if this consent is not given. While the federal and some state governments have developed guidelines that allow medical practitioners to treat mature minors without parental consent, some providers are not aware of these and even if they are, are still worried about potential legal issues or find them confusing, Massie said. “In some states, like Queensland and Victoria, it’s clear that the 12- to 15-year-old group should be able to get vaccinated under their own steam,” he told the MJA Insight podcast. “In South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales, you need a parent’s consent, but in NSW it’s messy depending on who you ask.” However, it is always ethical to assess each child and teenager on an individual basis, Massie and his colleagues wrote, and to vaccinate if certain considerations have been made. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning For example, vaccine providers should consider the child’s knowledge about the illness they’re being vaccinated against; talk them through the risks and benefits; try to understand their family context and how their parents may react if they find out; check for any learning difficulties and medical conditions; and consider making the medicare record of 12-to-13-year-olds private. “This is sometimes called the mature minor doctrine… There is no minimum age for a mature minor, the critical issue is the capacity to make the specific health care decision,” the authors wrote. They called for any confusion about vaccinating children against parent consent to be cleared through the mature minor doctrine becoming accepted as “standard practice” throughout Australia. “Parents refusing Covid‐19 vaccination for their children is not in the best interests of the child based on medical recommendations and, further, could be conceived as harmful by failing to reduce the risk of disease due to SARS‐CoV‐2 [Covid-19] infection.” Dr Catherine Orr, a GP who works for a community vaccination clinic in Melbourne, said she agreed with Massie and his co-authors and that staff had been briefed about what to do if a child said they wanted to be vaccinated against their parent’s consent. In these cases, the clinician will assess the young person and ensure that they are a “mature minor” and can consent for medical procedures, Orr said. “It’s standard for medical procedures for children under 18. I support it, as I do for any other medical process.” Dr Nusrat Homaira, a paediatric respiratory epidemiologist in Sydney, said she always tries to work with and educate caregivers when conflicts about medical decision-making for their children arise. “Within Australia, the paediatric population is considered anyone less than or equal to 17,” she said. “I think for me, the more important issue when speaking about someone 12 or 13 especially is engaging in those vaccine conversations with their parents first. “We know from our work that healthcare providers like doctors and nurses play a huge role in in communicating risks to parents, and people do make informed decisions if you communicate properly with them.”",News/Australia news,"Over-12s should be able to get Covid vaccine in Australia without parental consent, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/24/over-12s-should-be-able-to-get-covid-vaccine-in-australia-without-parental-consent-say-experts
1/24/2022,"Much like Jesus Christ, the friction between Kanye West and the general public comes from an attunement to the grandeur of his own destiny that can read like delusional arrogance. His first album as a rapper, 2004’s The College Dropout, is littered with nods to his significant place in history and how they foretell an auspicious future. He mentions his mother’s arrest at “the tender age of six” for Oklahoma City’s sit-in protests, declaring “with that in my blood, I was born to be different”. As he’d have it, it was no mere coincidence that on the fateful night of his near-death experience in a 2002 car crash, he was brought to the same hospital where Notorious BIG drew his final breaths. In one of the comedic skits breaking up the tracklist, a snot-nosed character delivers a line that rings out like a broad artistic statement of purpose for its writer: “This was meant to be.”  And indeed, it was. Many of the claims that skeptics took as boastful chest-puffing – that he’d be one of the greatest emcees to ever pick up a mic, that he’d revolutionize hip-hop and fashion in his own image, that he would attain such notability as to make him one of the main characters of planet Earth – were borne out with time and recast as extreme yet correct self-assurance in the face of insecurity. (Crucially, The College Dropout is also shot through with feelings of inadequacy, West’s anxiety about living up to the stratospheric standards he feels God has set for him.) Though his belief in himself may have been expressed in the language of borderline-pathological ego, his later successes retroactively transformed that mentality into a defiant assertion of worth. The future’s context brings clarity to the past deeds and words of a confounding, complex figure, but in the new documentary jeen-yuhs, that cuts both ways to shed some insight on the chaos that’s engulfed West as of late. The three-part bio-epic from music video stalwarts Coodie and Chike, now playing through the virtual Sundance festival prior to a Netflix debut in February, tracks West’s trajectory from an intimate on-the-ground perspective with the breadth of a bird’s-eye view. In covering 21 eventful years in the life of the enigma now known as Ye, with special focus placed on his formative pre-fame era, we can start to make sense of the erratic later period that’s seen West palling around with Trump, getting born again, and wilding out (even for him) on social media. Coodie and Chike’s diligent portraiture teaches any given viewer what armchair celeb scholars already know: with enough close study, even the most bewildering famous-person behavior can be rendered comprehensible. The recent name-change, for one – when a young West saw himself erroneously billed under the mononym of Kanye, he joked to Coodie that he’ll preclude disrespects moving forward by ditching his surname, or better yet, just going by Ye. The four and a half hours of jeen-yuhs yield a handful of prophetic moments like this, in which happenings decades down the road are foreshadowed with eerily specific prescience. In one of the dozens of cameos sure to please devotees of early-aughts hip-hop, Pharrell Williams stops by the studio as West prepares his sophomore LP to lay out the younger man’s next chapter. West will make it, Williams soothsays, and when he does, the greatest threat to his brilliance will be a complacency he can only stave off through constant hunger and self-doubt. With these words in mind, the shape-shifting that would define his career after he earned GOAT-level plaudits for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in 2010 starts to resemble a master’s search for a new challenge, rather than a haphazard effort to see what works. Alexander wept, for there were no more rappers to conquer, so he made an indie rock album with Kid Cudi and then went gospel. More often, however, the connecting lines aren’t so direct. The structure of the film’s three sections (the first starts in 1999 and ends with West signing to Roc-A-Fella Records in 2001, the second makes it to his double-win at the 2005 Grammys, and the third blazes through the next 16 years) invites us to form an impression of West’s personality and then use it as a decoder. His meticulousness as a musical technician plays against a natural sense of humor in his come-up, a big grin and unchecked laugh gone from the final third aside from the briefest flicker. In his loping, endearing voiceover narration, Coodie states in plain terms that some inner glow seems to have faded from West in the time since they last met. We see that his shoulder is all chip, a complex he’ll spend the rest of his adulthood raging against. As a Black man in a racist country, as a preternaturally gifted producer no industry gatekeepers wanted to hear rhyme, and as a Chicagoan in a rap topography with peaks in Los Angeles and New York, he came to the game in a defensive crouch he never really left. Coodie and Chike emphasize the tooth-and-nail fight for every scrap of recognition; in a scene both funny and sad, West barges into offices at Roc’s headquarters and spits verses at a series of mid-level executives until he can find whoever will give him a deal. Having to take everything he’s ever been given permanently sculpted West’s psychology, making him an underdog surrounded by influential people who want to see him fail. West would later claim to relate to Donald Trump through their shared “dragon energy”, an inscrutable euphemism for the sheer might required for an outsider to bust into a power structure pitted against him. Every bit as telling is his relationship to his mother Donda, the only person more important to Kanye West than Kanye West. Beyond singlehandedly raising her son in the wake of a divorce when he was only three, she’s supplied him with the unflagging, unambiguous encouragement he needs in his uphill pursuits. In one poignant scene at his mother’s apartment, West does an a cappella rendition of his devotion song Hey Mama for her, both smiling as he recalls her supporting his choice to bail on higher education despite disagreeing with it. He transforms around her, loosening into a happier, more relaxed version of himself. Her death in 2007 precipitates West losing the levity that animated his first three albums, and along with it, his sense of what matters to him. (It’s hard to discern the place family has in his life once he starts his own, as ex-wife Kim Kardashian is conspicuously absent in the film, surely due to some legal jiu-jitsu behind the scenes.) However sympathetic to its subject, the film isn’t flattering in its attempts at understanding. The notorious clip of Barack Obama referring to West as a ‘jackass’ goes hand in hand with an embarrassing encounter in which West drunkenly refers to Coodie by the wrong name following a while apart. At one point, West mentions his difficulties with medication and drug use in passing. A few days ago, he took to Instagram to demand final-cut privileges over Jeen-yuhs so that he can “be in charge of [his] own image.” But Coodie and Chike haven’t set out to get him, nor absolve him. They come from a place of genuine concern, helpless to watch a man with a turbulent brain losing his way, hoping only that he can find the aid he needs. At the heart of their before-and-after technique is uncertainty over the elusive question of the “real” Kanye. The directors leave us to ponder whether he’s a decent soul who’s gone astray or a megalomaniac who’s achieved his true form, each conclusion negating the other. Their film is a prism, refracting the image West is now fighting to control, its picture depending on the angle from which we view it. Early on, we see him lay down a verse from College Dropout cut Never Let Me Down, saying that his fellow Black voters “can’t make it to ballots to choose leadership / But we can make it to Jacob’s and to the dealership”. At the time, it sounded like a callout to injustices stripping minorities of their political rights while they’re distracted by material riches. But in light of his outrageous third-act comments that slaves made the choice to remain in bondage for 400 years, that line takes on the tang of blame, as if he’s chastising the African-American community for their own disenfranchisement. We can’t know which parts of Kanye West are sincere and which are a troubled distortion of the same. His past and present are inextricable, both in a state of continuous reassessment. All we can do is observe how they feed into and warp each other. jeen-yuhs is showing at the Sundance film festival and will be available on Netflix in February",Arts/Film,jeen-yuhs: what can we learn from the new Kanye West documentary?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/23/kanye-west-documentary-jeen-yuhs-sundance
