4/12/2022,"As Russia’s war of aggression continues to ravage its neighbor, the Kremlin’s propaganda apparatus has been more blatant than ever in outlining the country’s goals for its biggest nemesis: the U.S. Last week, American intelligence officials reportedly assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin may use the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine as a pretext to order a new campaign to interfere in U.S. elections. Though AP reported that “it is not yet clear which candidates Russia might try to promote or what methods it might use,” Russian state media seem to be in agreement that former U.S. President Donald Trump remains Moscow’s candidate of choice. The time is coming “to again help our partner Trump to become president,” state TV host Evgeny Popov recently declared. On Thursday’s edition of the state television show The Evening With Vladimir Soloviev, Putin’s pet pundits offered an update on plans for 2024. Kremlin TV Hopes Russia’s Unhinged Ukraine War Claim Will Help Re-Elect Trump “We’re trying to feel our way, figuring out the first steps. What can we do in 2023, 2024?,” Russian “Americanist” Malek Dudakov, a political scientist specializing in the U.S., said. He suggested that Russia’s interference in the upcoming elections is still in its early stages, and that more will be accomplished after the war is over and frosty relations between the U.S. and Russia start to warm up. “When things thaw out and the presidential race for 2024 is firmly on the agenda, there’ll be moments we can use,” he added. “The most banal approach I can think of is to invite Trump—before he announces he’s running for President—to some future summit in liberated Mariupol.” Dmitry Drobnitsky, an omnipresent “Americanist” on Soloviev’s show, suggested that Tulsi Gabbard should be invited along with Trump. Dudakov agreed: “Tulsi Gabbard would also be great. Maybe Trump will take her as his vice-president?” Gabbard has recently become a fixture of state television for her pro-Russian talking points, and has even been described as a “Russian agent” by the Kremlin’s propaganda machine. If state television is any indication, the real agenda of the Kremlin’s operatives was never limited to boosting any particular candidates, but rather aimed to harm America as a whole. Dudakov stressed: “With Europe, economic wars should take priority. With America, we should be working to amplify the divisions and—in light of our limited abilities—to deepen the polarization of American society.” He went on: “There is a horrific polarization of society in the United States, very serious conflicts between the Democrats and Republicans that keep expanding. You’ve already mentioned that America is a dying empire—and most empires weren’t conquered, they were destroyed from within. The same fate likely awaits America in the near decade. That’s why, when all the processes are thawed, Russia might get the chance to play on that.” Dudakov’s Twitter feed, which he maintains despite the service being blocked in Russia, offers a glimpse into his own propaganda efforts. Tweeting as “Duderman67,” Dudakov focuses on criticizing U.S. President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Hillary Clinton—while boosting Trump. On his Thursday show, host Soloviev argued that Russia wasn’t fighting against the United States with full competency just yet, and griped about losing the main weapon behind enemy lines: “the brilliantly working structure of RT,” the Kremlin-funded state TV network that was banished from U.S. cable stations last month. He then offered up his own ideas about how to influence American voters without the help of RT: “I would act through various diasporas. For example, I would work with the Spanish-speaking media—since America is becoming predominantly Spanish-speaking, with the colossal influence of Latin America, I would work through their press, through those narratives, moving in that direction… they aren’t allowing us to work with American media directly, but we have many opportunities that we aren’t using thus far.” Appearing on Soloviev’s show two days earlier, Vitaly Tretyakov, dean of the Moscow State University's School of Television, complained that Russia: “had military hypersonic weapons, but we don’t have informational hypersonic weapons… all of our forces need to be dedicated to that. We don’t have info-weapons equal in strength to our hypersonic weapons... as opposed to what they have. You can’t survive in this world without winning an info-war. That is out of the question.” Putin Crony Melts Down After Airing Wrong Clip of Soldiers Calling Russia ‘a Bitch’ Pundit Karen Shakhnazarov suggested: “I would find it useful to break diplomatic relations with the United States. I don’t see any point in maintaining them. And that would deliver a crushing blow to Biden. There are plenty of people in the U.S. who say that he is bringing us all to the edge of nuclear war. That will be a strong signal.” That wasn’t the only talk of nuclear war on Soloviev’s show this week. On Thursday, Soloviev confirmed a well-known concept frequently aired on state media when he acknowledged: “De facto, we aren’t fighting a campaign against Ukraine, but against the entire West.” A parade of pundits recounted various ways U.S. sanctions are affecting the Russian economy, and the limited avenues for Russian retaliation. Soloviev resorted to pulling out his beloved trump card designed to intimidate the West: the threat of nuclear war. He asked: “Maybe it’s time we strike them? Since we’re already a pariah state, a war criminal, if everything is so bad.” Short of nuclear holocaust, it is now clear that Russia is focusing its efforts on distracting America from its foreign policy objectives by threatening to meddle in U.S. internal affairs. Speaking about the upcoming midterm elections on Soloviev’s show last week, Konstantin Dolgov, the deputy chairman of the Committee on Economic Policy of Russia’s Federation Council, predicted that “the results will apparently not be good for the Democrats,” because of rising gas prices in the U.S. But the midterms, he emphasized, are “just a rehearsal. The main elections are further ahead and preparations for those are already underway.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

4/12/2022,"In 2020, Natalie Arabian bought bitcoin at $6,700 and ether at $173, then dropped out of college. Shortly after, she bought over 200 ether tokens at an average cost of $300 each. Now, she's a full-time crypto influencer and investor, and aims to inspire more women to invest. For Natalie Arabian, the start of the pandemic in 2020 was the door into cryptocurrency markets, and ultimately, a path to becoming a full-time influencer in the space. In April 2020, Arabian told Insider that she was growing nervous that the Federal Reserve would begin printing massive amounts of money to keep the economy afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic. As her concerns about the economy mounted, she sought alternative investments outside of traditional financial markets. Receipts provided to Insider showed that Arabian bought bitcoin at $6,700 and ether at $173, and over the next two months, she bought over 200 ether tokens for an average cost of less than $300. With the pandemic closing the doors on her college campus and leaving her to complete her biology degree online, she decided it was no longer the route forward for her. ""The amount of money I started making [from crypto] was unlike anything that I could've made after college, and it got to the point where the opportunity cost of studying and being in school was just too great to ignore,"" Arabian told Insider. She added that her plans to attend graduate school would have cost even more up-front money, and she made the choice to invest it in cryptocurrency instead. During the summer of 2020, Arabian dropped out of college. Since then, she's built up a following of nearly 60,000 across Twitter and TikTok, where she posts crypto and Web3 investing advice. Despite being described as an influencer, she sees herself primarily as an investor. ""I didn't intend to become an influencer in the beginning. It came from a very organic place of having fun on Twitter and meeting people with a similar interest in shaking up 'legacy finance,'"" Arabian said. Although she had snapped up bitcoin at a low price, the world's largest cryptocurrency no longer fits into her investment approach, Arabian noted. In learning more about the ethereum technology and its ecosystem, Arabian said she began shedding positions in all tokens except ether. ""The more I found out about ethereum's smart-contract capabilities, I eventually stopped investing in bitcoin and solely focused on ether,"" she said. ""I got very lucky early on investing in some other tokens, but I'm a big advocate for just sticking with ethereum since most people get burned on other tokens,"" she said. The smart-contract technology ethereum offers is unmatched in her view, and she's encouraged by the fact that the token is on track to become a deflationary asset thanks to a certain amount of the tokens being taken out of circulation. Currently, ethereum is undergoing a transition from a proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The change is meant to reduce the network's energy usage, increase efficiency, and make it cheaper to use. Ether is a strong bet for investors because it operates as part of one of the most well-established blockchains in existence, Arabian added. ""It has a first-mover advantage in the crypto space — it was early, and has had time to establish its technology and product."" Moving forward, Arabian intends to advocate for more women to enter the crypto space, and shift the perception of finance as a male-dominated arena. Specifically, she wants to inspire change through longer, educational video content on YouTube. Her investment philosophy, however, won't be changing anytime soon. ""The most money I've made by far is just from sitting on my ether and not doing anything else. That's my biggest advice. Just sit on ether.""

4/12/2022,"WASHINGTON — Patriarch Kirill, leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, has been a loyal ally of President Vladimir Putin for years. But his vociferous support of the invasion of Ukraine has drawn strong rebukes from religious leaders who say he has forsaken Christian teachings by supporting the Kremlin’s destructive campaign. In his most recent Sunday sermon, delivered at the Church of the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos, Kirill told worshipers to respect official power — a message seemingly intended to bolster a military campaign that has gone badly for Russia. Once called “the politicking patriarch,” Kirill was enthroned in 2009 and is closely associated within Russia with the current political regime. “May the Lord help us all in this difficult time for our Fatherland to unite, including around the authorities,” Kirill said in the sermon. He hoped that the Russian people would maintain “the ability to repel external and internal enemies.” Kirill has been a vociferous and consistent supporter of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, despite the fact that the vast majority of Ukrainians are Eastern Orthodox. On Sunday, nearly 300 leaders of the Ukrainian Orthodox church signed a letter accusing Kirill of “moral crimes” for his endorsement of the unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which has killed thousands of civilians. “Our position is fully consistent with the Gospel and the church tradition,” the Ukrainian clergymen wrote. “Defending the homeland from the enemy is one of the main Christian virtues.” Many Christian leaders in the West have denounced the invasion, including Pope Francis and members of Kirill’s own church. Most Russian clergy, however, share Kirill’s views. Metropolitan Mitrofan of Murmansk said the invasion of Ukraine was a battle against “the Antichrist.” Mitrofan also said that the Orthodox Church in Ukraine was “not a real church,” in reference to the schism between the Ukrainian and Russian churches three years ago, angering both Putin and Kirill. Long suspected of having once been an agent of the KGB — the Soviet era security service that frequently singled out religious dissidents — Kirill is a symbol of the resurgence of the Orthodox Church under Putin, who has used religion to bolster his nationalistic, anti-Western vision. In 2013, Kirill decried same-sex marriage as “a very dangerous sign of the apocalypse.” Four years later, he criticized Western Europe for the “grave mistake” of straying from Christianity. Although Russian society has become increasingly religious since the fall of the Soviet Union, which officially embraced atheism, Kirill has not wholly escaped scrutiny. In 2012, a photograph of Kirill wearing a $40,000 watch was airbrushed to remove the timepiece, leading to widespread derision and mockery. Two years ago, he was seen wearing a watch costing $16,000, this time without apparent concern for public backlash. When Putin first decided to launch an invasion of Ukraine in late February — in what he described as an effort to “denazify” the country’s government, which is led by a Jewish president — Kirill told members of the armed forces that they were on “the correct path.” He also alluded to threats mounting “on the borders of our Fatherland,” in an obvious reference to Ukraine and its Western allies. A sovereign nation since 1991, Ukraine has sought to chart a course distinct from its Soviet legacy. Kyiv’s desire for autonomy has always been viewed as an affront by Putin, who first invaded Ukraine in 2014. He invaded again eight years later, expecting an easy victory, only to face protests at home and condemnation abroad. Kirill remains a key ally for an increasingly embattled Kremlin. “The Russian Orthodox Church's moral blessing of this war has been years in the making,” Russia expert Samuel Ramani of Oxford University said earlier this month. While few have been surprised by Kirill’s loyalty to Putin, his seeming lack of concern for the plight of ordinary Ukrainians has renewed criticism of his tenure. While he has made generic calls for peace, the 75-year-old bishop has also made no secret of his true sympathies. “We have entered into a struggle that has not a physical, but a metaphysical significance,” Kirill said in early March. In a widely condemned sermon earlier this month, Kirill struck out against the West while envisioning the same fictitious unity of Slavic peoples that Putin has invoked and Ukrainians have rejected. “Today the word ‘independence’ is often applied to almost all countries of the world,” Kirill said on the same day that much of the world was encountering the images of slaughtered civilians in Bucha. “But this is wrong, because most of the countries of the world are now under the colossal influence of one force, which today, unfortunately, opposes the force of our people.” The April 3 sermon was delivered at the main cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces. Kirill did not name the malevolent force he had in mind, but Putin has blamed the United States for engineering Ukraine’s successful resistance to Russia. “We are a peace-loving country and a very peace-loving, long-suffering people who suffered from wars like few other European nations,” Kirill went on to say. “We have no desire for war or for doing something that could harm others. But we have been so educated by our entire history that we love our Fatherland and will be ready to defend it in the way that only Russians can defend their country.” The April 3 sermon led to a rebuke from a leader of the Greek Orthodox in the United States. “From the words and actions of Patriarch Kirill, we can conclude he has made the same bargain with Putin and his cronies. This is, indeed, a sad moment for our church, and the whole world is watching,” Archbishop Elpidophoros said in a speech the following day. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, called for the World Council of Churches to eject Russia after the April 3 sermon. “The riot act has to be read,” Lord Williams said in an interview with the BBC.  “When a Church is actively supporting a war of aggression, failing to condemn nakedly obvious breaches in any kind of ethical conduct in wartime, then other churches have the right to raise the question and challenge it — to say, unless you can say something effective about this, something recognizably Christian, we have to look again at your membership.” Present at the sermon Kirill delivered on Sunday were several representatives of Norilsk Nickel, the mining giant, which helped construct the church where service took place.
