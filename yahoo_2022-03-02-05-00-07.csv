3/2/2022,"Ashton Kutcher — who's been showing his support for Ukraine, where wife Mila Kunis was born — is calling on his social media following to deliver a message to Russian citizens. ""If you know someone from Russia, call them and tell them their media is lying to them,"" The Ranch actor, 44, wrote in a Twitter post in both English and Russian on Monday. ""Ukraine doesn't want to fight, they just don't want Putin's government and don't want to be occupied."" Post for socials: If you know someone from Russia Call them and tell them their media is lying to them. Ukraine doesn't want to fight, they just don't want Putin's government and don't want to be occupied. — ashton kutcher (@aplusk) March 1, 2022 Kutcher also shared tweets from Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky saying that the lodging service is offering free housing to 100,000 refugees fleeing from Ukraine amid Russia's invasion. (Kutcher is an investor in the company.) Over 520,000 refugees have fled Ukraine since Russia waged war last week, the United Nations has estimated. The U.N. expects the total to reach 4 million in coming weeks. Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the invasion, which has seen Russia try to take over Ukrainian cities while the country's army — and armed citizens — fight back. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed European Parliament on Tuesday, saying, ""We are fighting just for our land and for our freedom,"" adding, ""Nobody's going to break us. We are strong. We're Ukrainians. We have a desire to see our children alive. I think it's a fair one. Yesterday, 16 children were killed."" When Russia invaded last week, Kutcher took to Twitter to say, ""I stand with Ukraine."" The assumption is that he's speaking on behalf of his family as Kunis, 38, does not have public-facing social media accounts. Kunis, who married Kutcher in 2015, was born in Chernivtsi, Ukraine, when it was still part of the former Soviet Union. At age 7, her family moved to the United States — with just $250. Kunis has said her parents, who reside near her in Los Angeles, didn't tell her they were moving to a different country when they left, amid the fall of communism. The family, along with her older brother Michael boarded a train to Moscow. From there, they flew to Los Angeles on a refugee visa. She started school days later. ""I literally had no clue of a different continent let alone a different language or people or diversity,"" she said on a HouzzTV special in which she gave her parents condo — which they have lived in since 1992 — a makeover. Moving to L.A. ""was all very jarring and very shocking."" She told The Telegraph in 2011 that she blocked out second grade completely and doesn't ""have any memories... My parents tell me, I cried every morning and when I came back from school."" However, she soon adapted. Kunis's dad had worked as a mechanical engineer and her mother was a physics teacher in Ukraine but their degrees and jobs didn't transfer. So they pursued new professions in the U.S. with her dad becoming a cab driver — and doing other odd jobs — and her mom worked at Rite Aid. While Kunis landed her role on That '70s Show in 1998 — with future husband Kutcher — she also a job at Rite Aid with her mom. ""My mom would pick me up from '70s Show, and she'd take me to work with her,"" she told Elle in 2014. ""I'd have to work the ice cream counter or photo counter until closing all the time."" Kunis said in her 2011 interview with The Telegraph, ""Nowadays, if you have money you think Moscow or wherever is great. But that’s not the reality of the Russia I grew up with."" Kunis now has two children of her own with Kutcher: daughter Wyatt, 7, and 5-year-old son Dimitri.",World/Yahoo Celebrity,Ashton Kutcher continues to show support for Mila Kunis's native Ukraine: 'If you know someone from Russia ... tell them their media is lying to them',https://news.yahoo.com/ashton-kutcher-show-support-mila-kunis-native-ukraine-191547011.html

3/2/2022,"ELKHART — A Jimtown High School teacher has requested early retirement, Baugo school officials say, after he was captured on video striking a student with enough force to cause visible injuries. Baugo officials said in a press release Friday that the teacher, Mike Hosinski, is no longer with Baugo Community Schools and is not allowed on school grounds. The incident, which occurred Friday morning, has been referred to the Indiana Department of Child Services and the Elkhart County Sheriff's Department, school officials said Friday. Elkhart: Jimtown High School teacher who struck student will retire early, collect pension ""Any action that threatens to harm any student will be quickly, directly, and severely addressed,"" states a press release from Baugo schools. ""All Jimmies must be able to learn in a safe environment."" Baugo Community Schools' attorney released video of the Friday encounter upon a request from The Tribune. In the 44-second video, a student with a hood pulled up is seen entering the hallway with an adult following quickly behind. The adult jogs to catch up with the student, rounds a corner and is then seen using the student's backpack to force him into the wall. The adult wags his finger in the video, which does not include any sound. The adult then hits the student with such force the boy's head snaps back into the wall behind him. The boy falls to the ground after the adult places both of his hands on the student's shoulders in an attempt to direct him down the hallway. Multiple witnesses appear toward the end of the exchange, including a woman who checks on the boy as he lies on the floor. Baugo officials said the incident occurred after the teacher confronted the student about a hoodie he wore to class. The district's statement says a verbal exchange occurred in the hallway and ""inexplicably, the teacher struck the student in the face with an open-handed slap."" School officials say the student, who has not been identified publicly, suffered visible injuries and medical staff immediately provided treatment. ""The safety of students attending Baugo Community Schools is our highest priority and greatest responsibility,"" Baugo's Friday press release reads. ""When anyone, including a teacher, undermines that priority and responsibility, swift action must and will be taken to safeguard Jimtown students. Anything less cannot be tolerated."" In addition to contacting the Elkhart County Sheriff's Department and Department of Child Services, school officials say they reached out to licensing officials with the Indiana Department of Education. More on Baugo: Complaints prompt removal of political materials from class A DCS spokeswoman said in an email Monday that Indiana confidentiality laws prohibit the department from commenting on DCS involvement. The Tribune has left a message with the Elkhart County Sheriff's Department. A spokeswoman for the Elkhart County Prosecutor's office said Monday morning no charges have been filed at this time. Baugo school officials say they will fully cooperate with all investigations and will offer support services to the student involved. A letter to Baugo families Sunday clarified Hosinski's status with the school after district officials say incorrect facts were shared by local outlets and on social media. Hosinski was not fired by Baugo schools, district officials say, but rather requested an early retirement. Hosinski, a teacher for 40 years, requested in January to retire at the end of this school year, but submitted another request to leave immediately following Friday morning's incident, according to the district. The Baugo school board is expected to vote Monday evening on the teacher's accelerated retirement request. ""Standard procedure prohibits any Baugo Community School employee from being on school grounds while an investigation into possible criminal or civil misconduct is occurring,"" Baugo Superintendent Byron Sanders wrote in the letter Sunday. ""The investigations into Mr. Hosinski's actions remain ongoing. Consequently, until those investigations conclude, he is prohibited from being on school premises."" The Tribune could not immediately reach Hosinski for comment. The Tribune has left messages for the district's superintendent. This is not the first time Hosinski's conduct as a teacher has been called into question. In 2019, the Northern Indiana Atheists announced its intention to file a complaint with the Freedom from Religion Foundation over concerns the teacher promoted personal political views in his classroom. More: Complaints prompt removal of political, religious materials from Jimtown High School classroom Photos obtained by the organization showed posters and stickers in a classroom with messages like ""Proud to be a conservative,"" ""Choose life, your mom did,"" and ""Liberalism is a mental disorder."" A parent also told Northern Indiana Atheists, Hosinski told students in his class ""Hillary and Obama are criminals, President Donald Trump is great, and Democrats are liars."" Some on social media are defending the longtime teacher. Posts on Facebook detailed plans of a student walkout Monday morning, and a Change.org petition entitled ""Save Mr. Mike Hosinski Tenure and Retirement"" had collected more than 1,200 signatures by noon Monday. Hosinski was named JHS Teacher of the Year in 2020, according to a Jimtown High School social media post. Baugo's school board is expected to meet at 7 p.m. Monday in at the district's Educational Service Center.

3/2/2022,"The Belarusian president may have revealed Russia's plan of attack on Ukraine on live TV. Ukrainian President Alexander Lukashenko showed ""what looks like an actual invasion map,"" a reporter tweeted. The map also showed Ukraine divided into four sections. Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko may have accidentally revealed Russia's invasion plans of Ukraine on live television. A short video shared by Belarusian journalist Tadeusz Giczan on Twitter showed Lukashenko pointing to a map of Ukraine. He is a longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""I thank these guys!"" Lukashenko said although it is unclear who he was referring to. ""They warned us, and literally, six hours before the launch of the missiles, we discovered this, and the Russians... Iskanders [tactical missile system] were located here, right?"" At that point, someone off-screen says: ""In the Mazyr area,"" referring to a Belarusian city. ""In the Mazyr area,"" Lukashenko continued. ""We hit these rockets, these positions. And we haven't seen them afterward. During the offensive of the Russians in Ukraine, we already did not see them from the position. That's why I'm saying, yes, we have made launches from the territory of Belarus and I told frankly which positions we targeted. Sit down."" The video appeared to be published by a Belarusian pro-state Telegram channel. Ukraine's parliament said on Tuesday that Belarusian troops had entered the Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine, near the country's border with Belarus. It said the information was confirmed by Vitaliy Kyrylov, spokesman for the North Territorial Defense Forces of Ukraine. The development came hours after Lukashenko told state news media that his country's troops were not joining Russia in its assault on Ukraine. According to Politico, US defense officials said there was ""no confirmation that the Belarusians are entering Ukraine, we've seen no indication of that."" Tuesday marks day six of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting protests across the world, including in Russia.

3/2/2022,"U.S. Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield protested to her Israeli counterpart over Israel's refusal to join 87 countries in backing a U.S.-led resolution to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the UN Security Council on Friday, Israeli officials tell Axios. Why it matters: Israel has attempted to maintain good relations with both Russia and Ukraine during the crisis, and has even offered to serve as a mediator. But that fence-sitting has resulted in criticism from both sides and now from the U.S. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office and Foreign Ministry had been claiming for weeks that the Biden administration understood Israel's need to calibrate its reaction to the Russian invasion in order to maintain its security coordination with Russia in Syria. But Israel dragged its feet as the U.S. was gathering co-sponsors for the resolution and did not provide a clear answer before the meeting began. After the vote, which Russia vetoed, Thomas-Greenfield passed a message to the Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan stressing the Biden administration’s disappointment. Driving the news: 11 Security Council members voted in favor of the resolution, three (China, the United Arab Emirates and India) abstained, and Russia was the lone ""no"" vote. An Israeli foreign ministry official said the decision not to accept the U.S. request to co-sponsor the resolution was due to the fact that Israel is not a member of the UN Security Council and it was clear Russia would veto. Most close U.S. allies and partners did back the resolution, however. Data: United Nations; Map: Axios Visuals Behind the scenes: Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid told Israel's Security Cabinet on Sunday that the U.S. “contained” the Israeli refusal to join the resolution. “We speak to the Biden administration in a wide range of channels on various aspects of the Ukrainian issue and the bottom line is that our partners are well aware of our considerations,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lior Haiat told Axios. The U.S. mission to the UN declined to comment. What’s next: The UN General Assembly is expected to convene as early as Monday to vote on a resolution condemning Russia.

3/2/2022,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Republican-hired investigator of Wisconsin’s 2020 election testified Tuesday that the state Legislature should “take a very hard look at the option of decertification of the 2020” presidential election, a move that GOP leaders reiterated they won't make and that nonpartisan attorneys call illegal. Michael Gableman released a 136-page “interim report” amid a nationwide GOP effort to reshape elections following President Joe Biden’s victory over Trump. Gableman, a former conservative state Supreme Court justice who revealed Tuesday that he voted for Trump and whose probe has been dismissed as partisan by election experts and some Republicans, spent three hours detailing his findings before the Assembly elections committee. It was immediately met with bipartisan criticism. Republican Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke rejected the call to decertify the election. “Still not legal under Wisconsin law,” Steineke tweeted. “Beyond that, it would have no practical impact b/c there is no Constitutional way to remove a sitting president other than through impeachment or incapacity. Fools errand. Focus on the future.” Ann Jacobs, the Democratic chair of the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission, tweeted that Gableman was promoting a “crazy conspiracy theory” and that decertifying the election was “IMPOSSIBLE. NOT LEGAL.” Democratic Gov. Tony Evers called Gableman’s work a “circus,” an “embarrassment for our state” and a “colossal waste of taxpayer dollars” that spreads misinformation about the election, attacks the integrity of election workers and emboldens people to harass and demean public servants. He urged Republicans to end the investigation. But Gableman, who said he was negotiating a contract extension, said he would keep doing the work without one. “This guy need a competency test,” Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan tweeted in response. Much of Gableman’s report attacked millions of dollars in funding from a Mark Zuckerberg-backed foundation aimed at increasing voter turnout. Most of the money went to five Democratic-dominated cities. Gableman said the money amounted to “illegal bribery.” Three courts in the past year have upheld the grants as legal. His report also criticized how the state handled nursing home ballots during the pandemic as well as absentee ballot drop boxes. He recommended dismantling the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission that Republicans created. Gableman said his report provided rationale for decertifying the election, but whether to do that wasn't up to him. The report said doing that would not change who is president. Gableman revealed for the first time that he had voted for Trump. “You bet I did,” he said during a back and forth with a Democratic lawmaker. Biden defeated Trump by just under 21,000 votes in Wisconsin, a victory that has withstood recounts, multiple state and federal lawsuits, an audit by the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau and a report by the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty. An Associated Press review  of Wisconsin and other battleground states also found far too little fraud to have tipped the election for Trump. Gableman's report, paid for with $676,000 in taxpayer money, was first due in October but delayed after mayors and state and local election officials filed multiple lawsuits to block subpoenas issued to them. The officials said they were willing to meet in public to discuss the election, but not behind closed doors with Gableman. Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul, who filed a lawsuit to block Gableman's subpoena of the elections commission, called the report “a full-throated attack on our democracy and a truly shocking example of the authoritarian mindset at work."" Gableman said he had spent about $360,000 so far on the investigation and issued 90 subpoenas, but no one with information about how elections are run has spoken with him. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos ordered the Gableman probe under pressure from Trump and conservatives who wrongly believed that Wisconsin's election had been stolen. Trump on Tuesday encouraged people to watch the hearing where Gableman presented the results of his report. Gableman said his only goal was to find the truth. ""And while we don't have it entirely yet, we're getting there,” he said. Gableman recommended dismantling the bipartisan elections commission, which the Republican-controlled Legislature created in 2016, calling it “hopelessly incompetent.” Republican candidates for governor are also campaigning on doing away with the commission, a move that Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican legislative leaders oppose. “I will not be part of any effort, and will do everything possible to stop any effort, to put politicians in charge of deciding who wins or loses elections,” Steineke tweeted during Gableman's testimony. Gableman also said that more than $10 million grants awarded to Wisconsin cities by the Zuckerberg-funded The Center for Tech and Civic Life amounted to illegal bribery and was an “impermissible and partisan get out the vote effort.” Gableman said he hoped the report’s recommendations would be used by lawmakers to enact changes before the session ends next month. But Vos said last week before what was expected to be the Assembly’s last day in session that he didn’t expect any action on the recommendations before the 2022 midterm election. The Legislature did pass a package of election bills last week largely based on recommendations from the nonpartisan audit. Evers is expected to veto all of them.",Politics/Associated Press,GOP investigator: Wisconsin should weigh decertifying vote,https://news.yahoo.com/gop-investigator-wisconsin-weigh-decertifying-175621793.html
