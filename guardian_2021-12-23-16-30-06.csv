12/23/2021,"My sister got married at Christmas so she wouldn’t have to bank on good weather. This is a very my-sister rationale: like her father before her, she is a worrier. She tries to contain her anxiety by planning for the worst. The night before the wedding, my father fell on the stairs. My mother was unable to move him by herself and had to call her cousins for help. That night, she accepted what the rest of us had known for some time: she could no longer care for him at home. She had tried, but it was becoming dangerous for both of them.  After the fall, he remained bed-bound and never walked again. My sister went to see him on her way to the church. I waited in the car, fighting the irrational belief he had somehow done this on purpose. Of course, no one develops vascular dementia deliberately. Even so, he had managed to rearrange the dynamic of the day so that the bride was travelling to pay her respects to him, rather than the other way round. My father’s moods once had an almost mythic power. A lifelong hypochondriac, he never talked about his feelings but expressed them through a range of psychosomatic symptoms. He especially hated our mother going out without him, and would get crippling stomach cramps in the hours before her departure. Curiously, when he did become ill, he didn’t notice. Perhaps this was because the disease was laying waste to his cognitive function. By the time my sister married, he couldn’t walk, or eat without help, or talk in proper sentences. His decline looked particularly precipitous to me because I was living in London, so didn’t see him all that often. Every time I visited, it seemed he’d lost another skill. It was like having a new baby in the family, only backwards. And so it was that my mother had to walk my sister down the aisle. We huddled together in the porch, our breath coming out in pale plumes. The day was clear and very cold. The grass outside was tipped with frost. My sister was nervous, but the right kind of nervous – big-match butterflies rather than churning dread. Covertly, I scanned the congregation for my boyfriend. I had asked my sister to make him an usher, to compensate for the fact that my ex had been invited to the wedding. It hadn’t worked; he was still angry. He rarely lost his temper in public, but I knew the signs a tantrum was in the post: compression around his temples, a muscle going in his jaw. There was no statutory limit on how long he might nurse this particular grievance. But sooner or later, the bill would come in. The couple exchanged their vows. They promised to love each other, in sickness and in health. My sister came back down the aisle, on the arm of her new husband. They both looked disturbingly happy. The reception was held at a restaurant on the beach. The room was decked out in Christmas colours: red, gold, green. The marsh looked silver, in the low-angled winter sun. Over champagne, my boyfriend began to tell a stomach-churning story involving pizzas, shit and vomit. This isn’t wedding conversation, I thought. This isn’t anywhere conversation. Who talks like this past the age of three? “Don’t tell me,” I said. “I don’t want to know.” He leant in, and put his face close to mine. “You’re horrible,” he said. After the meal, my mother stood up and gave a short speech. She touched on my father’s condition, the reasons for his absence. I stared into my glass and thought about my parents. My father wasn’t perfect, by any means, but he had been a good husband to my mum: decent, dependable, kind. Now, she had to keep up her end of the compact, the guarantee that underwrites every marriage. That was what partnership was. It occurred to me then that my boyfriend and I weren’t really partners. We were like survivors in a dystopian movie, scrapping over water and bits of tarpaulin. Our relationship was less a union of two souls than a bad-tempered land grab between rival factions. I stayed with my family for Christmas. My father was kept in hospital, then moved into a care home. I remember looking at his face, against the pillow. His eyes sought mine, as if trying to communicate something. I pushed the hair back from his forehead. There wasn’t a line on his skin: he wasn’t old. But already he was consigned to a nursing bed, marking time until he died. I saw then that life wasn’t all that long. And it was briefer still, if this condition loitered in your genes. I’d like to say that I called my boyfriend and put our relationship out of its misery that instant. I didn’t. What I did do was make a private pact with myself, to stop lying. I would not marry him. I would not tie myself to him for the rest of my life, or even a small portion of it. That was the day I gave up pretending. Quite soon after that, I packed up my life in London, and left. The worst had happened, and unlike my little sister, I failed to anticipate it. My father went rapidly downhill after he moved into the care home, and stopped speaking altogether. He died four years later, a few weeks before Christmas. He never was much of a talker. But I count that moment of silent connection, a chastening glimpse of a future truncated, as his parting gift to me. He showed me that life is short and also tough. You should spend it with people you love.

12/23/2021,"An easy 12-mile (19km) cycle south from Valencia takes you to the sand dune beaches of El Saler and the Albufera nature reserve. I stayed two nights in the Parador de El Saler hotel, which looks on to the Mediterranean sea and is surrounded by pine forests. The nature reserve means the area has few buildings and is full of birds. I cycled to a birdwatching centre 10 minutes from the hotel to see flamingos. Albufera is famous for its very shallow salt-water lake and there are sunset trips in traditional flat-bottom boats. There are plenty of restaurants serving paella (cooked outside over fires made from orange-tree branches). I loved the beach and the forest.Sarah  A visit this month to Jökulsárlón glacier in Iceland was worth the effort. The drive from a small town, Vik, to the glacier through a vast expanse of snow-covered plains gave an exhilarating feeling of being on another planet. Small icebergs that had cracked away from the glacier and been chucked on to the contrasting black volcanic sandy beach glittered like diamonds – an extraordinary spectacle. Vik is idyllic, with snowy mountains on one side and the black sand beach on the other. The aurora watched from a hilltop church’s grounds was a spectacular display of colours.Radhamanohar Macherla Ceapabhal, known locally as Toe Head, looms wherever you are on the Isle of Harris. It only took me 15 years of visiting the Outer Hebrides to pluck up the courage to climb it. The views from the top are panoramic: the topaz waters and powder-white sands of almost every beach on the island sparkle below. From my elevated position, feathers glowed golden in the sunshine. For the first time, I had the privilege of looking down on not one, but three magnificent raptors. Enormous golden eagles swooped beneath me before soaring on thermals into the clouds.Vanessa Wright During our journey on the West Highland Way there was one place where I wished I could stay longer. The north end of Loch Lomond stole my heart with its dramatic landscape of placid lake and imposing mountains. We stayed in Beinglas Farm campsite, a quiet, friendly place with a bar, shop and good breakfasts. Walking away from loch you come to the Falls of Falloch fairly quickly, and many other small waterfalls besides that have an enchanting, fairytale quality. Take a dip in the little pools if you are brave: the water is as clear as a mirror.Philippa Hughes Cycling and walking have led us to discover local gems. Glasson Dock, a port that time forgot, should be your starting point. Cycle up the gravel-and-tarmac old railway line along the estuary to Lancaster (about five miles). Cross the Lune on the elegant Millennium bridge and then head towards Morecambe. Just a few hundred metres from this excellent and well-used cycle track is Susan’s Pies – our favourite is cheese and onion. Resist eating now but turn along the coast to Heysham, where you can eat in the graveyard of Grade I-listed S Peter’s church near the much older ruins of St Patrick’s chapel and its rock-cut tombs, overlooking the famous bay.Martin Charlesworth We had an utterly wonderful long weekend with family in Cornwall, where we were encouraged to partake in their regular activity of an early-morning dip in Bude sea pool, an outdoor swimming pool built the 1930s among the natural dramatic rock formations of the cliffs. The unheated seawater is refreshed with every high tide, and taking the plunge is a highly recommended to invigorate the soul and make you feel truly alive.Johanna Ogden With its palm trees, subtropical plants and striking coastal views, Henry’s campsite in Helston, Cornwall, transported us to a vibrant and bohemian world where for one week all we needed was common sense, flip-flops and a pitcher of cider. Mornings were easy, with a slow wander up to the farmhouse for coffee and a croissant (dodging free-range chickens and children en route), followed by sunny days spent wandering the coastal paths, stopping at beach bars and swimming in hidden coves. Our evenings ended perfectly with live music, fire-pit marshmallows and watching the sun melt into the ocean.Hayley Kenney Amarante is a small, quaint village in the north-east of the country. I was taken here on a surprise trip by my partner and was pleasantly surprised by the fantastic selection of restaurants and cafes. Our trip was spent taking short walks by the river and exploring the great tourist-friendly city of Porto, 35 miles away. For those looking for a challenge, I would recommend Paiva Walkways in Aveiro for its 12km mountainside trail through the beautiful hills of Arouca. All in all, a week away in September cost us £200 each, which, when you consider the cost of other European getaways, is an absolute steal.Mariah Sowa Having visited twice on short breaks this summer, we are now big fans of the market town of Diss in south Norfolk, with its historic “Heritage Triangle”, home to an abundance of independent shops, and its mesmerising mere. Among Diss’s many attractive historic buildings is the imposing neoclassical Corn Hall, still partly used as a corn exchange until the 1990s and now an arts venue. The central six-acre mere, teeming with fish, was once thought to be the waterfilled crater of an extinct volcano. We enjoyed relaxing on the lakeside decking of the Waterfront Inn and walking over the water on the floating boardwalk.Sharon Pinner Dovedale in Derbyshire was close enough to our school in north Birmingham for it to be the location of all our field trips, armed with measuring wheels, notepads and generic juice cartons – but I don’t think I appreciated its beauty back then. The stepping stones are a natural starting point, but walk in any direction and the vistas are stellar, the hill of Thorpe Cloud being the star. Without the class clown as a distraction, Lion Head rock really does look feline, and lovely Milldale becomes reachable without teachers who just want to get back for happy hour. This quiet time of year is perfect. Enjoy hot food and a movie at the cosy Northern Light Cinema in Wirksworth, about a 40-minute drive away.Antony T",Lifestyle/Travel,"Northern lights, wild flamingos and golden eagles: readers’ favourite holidays of 2021",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/dec/23/readers-favourite-holidays-of-2021
12/23/2021,"We are twins who needed to get our stuff home to France after graduating in London. We paid TNT to ship three large sealed plastic boxes, and two shrink-wrapped suitcases, all carefully labelled, within 48 hours. When they had not arrived three days later, we called every couple of days to be told they were on their way. Then we were informed that the documentation was incorrect, and that they had been “returned to sender”, ie, our old London address, where we no longer lived, and that the case was closed. Further calls revealed our belongings were in Deptford and could be delivered to a UK address, which we duly provided. They didn’t arrive there, either. After hours of phoning we were informed that the luggage had no identifying labels and, as a consequence, were lost. A 14-day process had to be launched to find them. After 14 days we contacted TNT again and heard that the items had been found, but had been sent to TNT’s head office in Bolton. It refused our request for photos to check they were ours. We suspect they have lost our shipment, or there’s a lack of drivers to deliver it. We are pretty distraught: our parcels contain all our student stuff.T and LW, Paris, France  Fedex, which owns TNT, was rather curt about this disastrous experience. “We recognise there has been an issue with this shipment and are in direct contact with our customer to resolve the matter as quickly as possible,” it says. “We apologise for any inconvenience.” But it failed to answer questions about what had happened to your belongings, or whether you will be compensated. It’s concerning that, within days of my contact, it was able to magic up the consignment and send photos. The good news is, they were yours; the bad, that during their two months of peregrinations, they had been squashed, cracked and crudely taped back together. You accepted an offer to deliver to a UK address and made your own arrangements to get them to France, but say that, so far, there’s been no word about compensation. I would like to give a thumbs up to Bose UK. I had a well-used pair of its SoundSport wireless headphones, bought more than two years ago. Recently, the battery in one bud began cutting out. I called Bose to see if I could get it sorted, and was told that, although the headphones were out of warranty, as a long-standing customer I would be sent a new set of upgraded headphones by courier at its expense. They arrived within five days.EG, Ramsgate, Kent Email your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

12/23/2021,"Fourteen-year-old Alondra Salinas had set out her new white sneakers and packed her backpack the night before the first day of in-person high school when police say she responded to an offer on Snapchat for blue pills, which turned out to be deadly fentanyl. Her mother couldn’t wake her the next morning. Seventeen-year-old Zachary Didier was waiting to hear back on his college applications when a fake Percocet killed him. Sammy Berman Chapman, a 16-year-old straight-A student, died in his bedroom after taking what he thought was a single Xanax.  Their tragedies are part of an explosion of drug-related deaths among US high school and college-aged youth, fueled by what experts say is a flood of fentanyl-filled counterfeit pills being sold on social media and sometimes delivered straight to kids’ homes. National statistics show a huge surge in drug-related deaths during the pandemic, with fatalities leaping to more than 93,000 in 2020, a 32% rise from 2019. But no group has seen a faster rise than youth under 24, according to a Guardian analysis of 2020 federal data. Among this age group, accidental drug deaths increased by 50% in a single year – taking 7,337 young lives in 2020. Experts say a large portion of this increase is due to the vast quantities of fentanyl streaming into the US. In California, where fentanyl deaths were rare just five years ago, a young person under 24 is now dying every 12 hours, according to a Guardian analysis of state data through June 2021. That’s a 1,000% increase over 2018, according to data from the California department of public health’s drug overdose dashboard. Fentanyl, a cheap, synthetic opioid up to 100 times more potent than heroin, is not only getting mixed with traditional street drugs such as heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana, federal authorities say – it is being pressed into millions of pills that look exactly like traditional pharmaceuticals. But the potency of counterfeit pills can vary dramatically. Federal agents seized nearly 10m counterfeit pills in the first three quarters of 2021 – more than the previous two years combined. And tests conducted on the pills showed that two out of five of the counterfeits contained enough fentanyl to kill, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Meanwhile, experts say drug dealing has moved away from dark alleys and street corners and on to social media, enabling young people to buy what they think are Xanax, Percocet or Oxycodone tablets from the privacy of their bedrooms. “These are not overdoses; these are poisonings,” said Shabbir Safdar, director of the Partnership for Safe Medicines, a non-profit fighting pharmaceutical counterfeits. “Nobody dies from taking a Xanax; nobody dies from taking a single Percocet. These are fake pills.” The author Sam Quinones, who follows the rise of fentanyl in his book The Least of Us: True Tales of America and Hope in the Time of Fentanyl and Meth, says the staggering quantities flooding into the country means “the days of recreational drug use are over”. “Every drug you try now is a game of Russian roulette.” Ed Byrne is tired of looking at dead bodies. Byrne, a special agent for the investigations unit of the US Department of Homeland Security, works in cooperation with the DEA and local law enforcement agencies on a San Diego task force that focuses solely on fentanyl deaths. In the team’s first year, 2018, there were 92 fentanyl deaths in San Diego county; this year, Byrne said, the county was on track to respond to more than 810. Sometimes he is called out to respond to multiple deaths a day. “This stuff doesn’t discriminate,” Byrne said. “We go and deal with a dead person who’s homeless. Then we get another call and we’re in a house that’s worth $12m and that person’s dead from the same drug.” On the morning of 23 June 2020, it all became personal. Byrne’s partner called him to say her 14-year-old nephew, Alexander Neville, had been found unconscious in his bedroom 40 minutes away in Orange county. Byrne and his partner jumped in their cars, but it was too late. Amy Neville, Alexander’s mother, said she had felt something was very off as soon as she went to her son’s room that morning. “I knocked on his door and, as soon as I touched the door, I knew something was wrong,” said the mother. “There was no energy there, it was like a weird feeling. I knocked on the door and he didn’t respond.” The family had already been struggling to get Alexander to stop using marijuana and vaping. Just a day earlier, they’d made a plan to get him into treatment, because he’d admitted he had been taking pills and said that he wanted help. But he never got the chance. “Alex had taken one pill that he thought was Oxycontin – one pill. I had no idea that one pill would kill him,” said his mother. “He had ordered an illegally manufactured pill right off of social media as easily as ordering a pizza.” Law enforcement and other experts agree that buying illicit pills has never been easier. Dealers have moved from the dark web to openly selling what they label as Oxycontin, Percocet, Xanax or Adderall on platforms like Snapchat, Instagram and Craigslist. A report released in December by the Tech Transparency Project (TTP) found that Instagram offers an instant “drug pipeline” for kids, making it possible for them to find Xanax, ecstasy and opioids in just a few clicks. The easy accessibility of fentanyl “is a subterranean crisis that is about to explode”, said Dr Daniel Ciccarone, a professor specializing in addiction medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “This is a much bigger problem than we appreciate: it’s an underground volcano.” Perla Mendoza believes it was a dealer on Snapchat who sold a fake Xanax that killed her son, 20-year-old Daniel Elijah Figueroa, on 16 September last year. Figueroa had been staying with his grandmother while waiting for community college to start. He had a bottle of 15 pills delivered to her house in Long Beach after complaining that he couldn’t sleep, Mendoza said. After his body was found by his bed in his grandmother’s home in a kneeling position that looked almost like a prayer pose, his family found the pharmaceutical bottle. Only one pill was missing. Mendoza shared with the Guardian screenshots of the Snapchat account where she believes her son got the fatal pills. In them, an advertiser offers free delivery of “Oxy” in Orange county. “Hit my line, doing hella deals the rest of this week,” one post reads. “It was one deadly pill that was strong enough to kill four adults,” said Mendoza, who hopes that other parents will get a chance to warn their children before it’s too late. “I feel like a lot of parents are like: ‘My kids aren’t into that.’ Well, neither was mine,” she said. “But that’s what kids are getting.” In August of this year, Neville and dozens of other parents of fentanyl victims lined up giant placards with photos of their lost children along the grand steps of the California state capitol. There were posters of kids in their school pictures, kids still in braces, kids giving the thumbs up on family beach trips. The parents gave speeches, pleading for measures to prevent drug dealing on social media, more prosecutions of drug importers and better mental health treatment for troubled teens. Mostly, they just called on state legislators to do something to stop more kids from dying. “We should be packing our son up for college right now and that is not happening for one reason: fentanyl,” said Laura Didier over a portable microphone. Her son, Zachary Didier, a talented musician who loved the cartoon character Snoopy and trained his own dog to sing while he accompanied him on the piano, died at age 17. Didier was set to be one of the valedictorians of his high school class. But on the morning of 27 December 2020, his dad found him slumped over his desk after taking one pill labelled as Percocet that he obtained on Snapchat. “He thought he was experimenting with a pharmaceutical-grade drug,” said his mom. “We are losing our kids and all they are doing is experimenting. Fentanyl doesn’t even give them a chance.” Jaime Puerta, who found his 16-year-old son Daniel Puerta-Johnson unconscious in his southern California home in April 2020, has helped parents organize protests outside the offices of Snapchat and on the streets of San Francisco, pushing for more action from social media sites, law enforcement and state regulators. “When I found him dead in his bed, I swore to myself I would do something,” he said. “I’m tired of waking up every day and hearing that a new child is dead.” Social media companies are now being forced to confront the deadly role their platforms can play. At a congressional hearing this month, lawmakers grilled the head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, about young people’s easy access to drugs. “Why are children’s accounts even allowed to search for drug content to begin with, much less allowed to do so in a way that leads them to a drug dealer in two clicks?” asked the Republican senator Mike Lee of Utah, referencing the Tech Transparency Project (TTP)’s report. “Accounts selling drugs or any other regulated goods are not allowed on the platform,” said Mosseri. “Apparently they are,” interjected Lee. In a statement to the Guardian, Jeanne Moran, a spokesperson for Meta, which owns Instagram, said the company takes down a huge number of drug-related posts and has “developed technology to find and remove this content proactively”. Moran cited company metrics showing “out of every 10,000 views of content on Instagram, we estimate no more than 5 of those views contained content that violated the policy (on legally-regulated goods)”. Jennifer Park Stout, vice-president of global public policy at Snap, said in an October Senate hearing that Snapchat had dramatically increased its efforts and was “absolutely determined to remove all drug dealers” from its site. She said the company had “deployed proactive detection measures” to remove drug dealers, but “they are constantly evading our tactics”. “What is happening on our platforms – and all across social media and technology platforms – is that young people, who are suffering from mental health and stress induced by the pandemic … are reaching for substances, oftentimes pills and opioids,” she said. “But these substances are laced with fentanyl, enough fentanyl to kill them.” Eric Feinberg, vice-president for content moderation at the non-profit watchdog group Coalition for a Safer Web, said dealers were churning out new accounts faster than technology companies could take them down. Feinberg runs regular social media surveillance looking for drug sales online and says dealers often operate with little fear of getting caught. Feinberg says that, once he signed up to follow a few drug sellers’ sites, social media algorithms began recommending more drug dealers for him to follow, in a phenomenon called algorithmic amplification. For example, after he followed some drug-related accounts on Instagram, Feinberg said, a dealer began following him out of the blue and barraging him with offers. Screenshots shared with the Guardian show the dealer flogging “pain pills, anxiety meds and other chemical research products” and urging him to make an order for delivery through the US mail. “It’s extremely easy to find this stuff,” said Feinberg. “In fact, the algorithms push this at you.” In October’s Senate hearing, Senator Amy Klobuchar commented that if social media companies were held legally liable for deaths due to drugs sold on their platforms, they might find faster ways to respond to the crisis. But the companies have long held that, as technology platforms, they are not legally accountable for content posted on their sites. “If a kid had just walked into, say, a pharmacy, they wouldn’t be able to get this,” said Klobuchar to Snap’s vice-president. “But, in this case, they can get on your platform and just find a way to buy it. That is the problem.” In a statement to the Guardian, Kelsey Donohue, a spokesperson for Snap, said the company was “determined to do our part to eradicate drug sales on Snapchat”. Donohue listed several steps Snap has taken, including raising awareness of counterfeit pills directly in the app, using machine learning to proactively detect drug-related content, and working with law enforcement and other experts. “We constantly evaluate where we can keep strengthening our work to combat this illegal activity,” Donohue said. For now, with dangers running so high, Safdar says the best thing parents and educators can do is talk to children about the deadly new stakes experimenting with drugs. “The current generation has to learn that a pill that didn’t come from a pharmacy or a hospital can’t be trusted and might be a life-ending event,” he said. “Unfortunately, they’re learning it by losing their colleagues.”",News/US news,Killed by a pill bought on Snapchat: the counterfeit drugs poisoning US teens,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/22/teen-fentanyl-deaths-pills-social-media
