5/17/2022,"A lavish Bel Air mansion that was listed for $87.8 million reportedly received just half of the asking price when it went to auction last week. According to CNBC, the highest bid for the property was just under $45.8 million — around 52% of the mammoth asking price. The mansion, located at 777 Sarbonne Road in Bel Air, was auctioned online by Concierge Auctions earlier this month. On top of its seven bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and “dramatic views of Los Angeles,” the property also boasts a range of unique features including a retractable hydraulic DJ table, a Feng Shui koi pond and a glass elevator. The house also comes complete with an infinity pool, a two-bedroom guest house and an underground wine cellar. While the sale is pending, the auction house is still accepting back-up bids. The buyer of the property will pay a 5% buyer’s premium on top of the final price, according to the listing. If it does go through at the current price, it would be the fourth most expensive home to ever sell at auction. The property’s seller, celebrity dermatologist and developer Alex Khadavi, told CNBC the auction results were “horrible, horrible, horrible."" ""Nobody told me this thing’s going to go below, below this level,” he added. Back in April, he told the Wall Street Journal the property would sell for more than its $50 million reserve price. However, with the highest bid apparently comiing in around $4.2 million under Khadavi’s reserve price, this has left both seller and agent highly disappointed. “Honestly, I’m not happy,” co-listing agent Aaron Kirman of Compass told CNBC. “We wanted more.” Although sellers aren’t usually obligated to accept a bid below the reserve, this sale may be forced to go ahead as part of Khadavi’s bankruptcy proceedings and therefore was auctioned under more complex circumstances than a regular sale. Khadavi is now reportedly racing to find another buyer who could offer more than the auction’s highest bid. A spokesperson for Concierge Auctions was not available for comment when contacted by Fortune, but the company’s president, Chad Roffers, offered this statement to CNBC: “With over 80 qualified showings in the last 60 days, we are confident market value was delivered.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune,Bel Air mega-mansion listed for $87.8 million flops at auction and the celebrity developer seller is furious,https://news.yahoo.com/bel-air-mega-mansion-listed-161003169.html
5/17/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted a meeting of the Russian-led military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), on Monday on the 30th anniversary of its founding—but the meeting was anything but celebratory. Instead, the heads of state from Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, which make up the collective defense organization, akin to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, went to the Kremlin Monday in Moscow to lament the world’s response to Putin’s war in Ukraine. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, sitting in a massive room with sweeping high ceilings and ornate, gold-covered walls, whined about “hellish” sanctions from the West and efforts to isolate Russia and Belarus—which has been supporting Putin’s military moves in Ukraine—from the rest of the world. “Belarus and Russia… are being defamed and excluded from international organizations at the whim of the West,” Lukashenko said. In a joint statement, the CSTO also stated that it is concerned about “external borders of the CSTO,” noting that they maintain “readiness to ensure the security of the borders.” Top U.S. Spy Spills on Putin’s ‘Drastic’ Secret Plan to Win War But Lukashenko complained that the members of the alliance haven’t been banding behind Russia as much as they should, especially as Russia works to address NATO’s expansion, a common argument Russian officials and allies have been using to justify the war in Ukraine. In a likely reference to Finland and Sweden expressing interest in joining NATO, Lukashenko called for more support as NATO’s threats continue, from “NATO saber-rattling near our western borders to a full-scale hybrid war unleashed against us,” according to Interfax. “Russia should not fight alone against the expansion of NATO,” he said. Putin himself complained about a “surge in frenzied Russophobia in the so-called civilized and politically correct Western countries,” and promised the expansion of NATO would “certainly evoke a response on our part. We will see what it will be like based on the threats that are created for us.” Putin also demanded that his counterparts do more for Russia in the future, citing what he claimed was “documentary evidence” found during the invasion in Ukraine that he said allegedly shows that “components of biological weapons were developed in close proximity to our borders.” Meeting of CSTO leaders started in Moscow https://t.co/gi5oOEtgr6 pic.twitter.com/QFZLc9hYHC — Liveuamap (@Liveuamap) May 16, 2022 To respond to those alleged biological weapons threats—threats Putin has said Russia has faced for some time—Putin rallied CSTO members during the meeting to agree to demonstrate their combined military might by running joint CSTO exercises this fall in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. “Efforts to maintain biological security also require the most serious attention,” he said. Putin also seemed to be pushing his counterparts to prop up his bogus justification for conducting the “special” military operation in Ukraine—to denazify the country. “I would like to highlight our priority task of jointly defending the memory of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, the feat of our peoples who saved the world from Nazism at the cost of enormous and irreparable sacrifices, and to counteract any attempts to whitewash the Nazis, their accomplices and modern followers,” Putin said, noting that he thinks Ukrainians are glorifying Nazis at the state level. After the summit, the group noted in a statement that other countries have been critical of Russia’s false claim that it invaded Ukraine to try to denazify the country, insisting that it is indeed the aim of the war, rather than a false pretense to invade. This photo of Putin meeting with his ""partners"" in the CSTO today is certainly illustrative.Normally, we use round tables in diplomacy to give everyone equal prominence - there's no head of the table. But Putin found a way; there is no doubt who's in charge in this picture. pic.twitter.com/bTUrfZO9RG — Corey Hogan (@coreyhogan) May 16, 2022 We “strongly condemn any attempts to falsify historical events related to our common contribution to countering Nazi aggression,” the CSTO said in a statement. “We express serious concern in connection with attempts to ban symbols associated with the Victory over Nazism.” The Putin-centric pity party comes as Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its 82nd day, with no end in sight—the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessed last week the war, which has shifted to the east of Ukraine, has nearly reached a “stalemate.” Putin’s military continues to flounder in Ukraine. As of Monday, Russian forces have lost 27,700 troops, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in an analysis Monday. But even though the fighting is reaching a protracted state, the Biden administration is still focused on providing security assistance to Ukraine to help thwart Russian attacks. The administration has already provided $300 million in security assistance to Ukraine just this fiscal year, with more expected soon. ‘Let Someone Whack You’: Russian Troops Are Now Deliberately Wounding Themselves to Get Out of Putin’s War  Putin’s CSTO pity party bemoaned the west’s military assistance to Ukraine, which the U.S. Defense Department has assessed has helped the Ukrainians’ resistance to Russian advances in the war. “So far, in the West, including in Washington, we see only a desire to prolong the conflict as much as possible,” Lukashenko said, referring to military aid. “The goals are clear: to weaken Russia as much as possible.” Nonetheless, the aid is set to keep flowing. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed other weapons and security assistance during a meeting this weekend in Berlin with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. And later this week, the Senate is expected to vote on $40 billion of aid to Ukraine, Senate Republican Leader Mitch MicConnell said Saturday. Read more at The Daily Beast.

 Yes, Brie Larson is a fitness inspiration because of her skills, but even more so for her willingness to try just about anything. The ""Captain Marvel"" star chronicles many of her fitness ventures on social media, and has shown us time and time again that she doesn't shy away from any challenge. From one-armed pull-ups to push-ups with weighted chains, her latest conquest? Pole dancing. On Monday, Larson posted a series of photos on Instagram of her trying a pole-dancing class with the wonderfully punny caption, ""Made an im-POLE-sive decision to try a new workout class."" In the photos, you can see Larson climbing the pole (harder than it looks) and doing a version of what appears to be the ""Ballerina"" pole trick. You can see she's gripping the pole with one hand and one foot while suspending the rest of her body away from the pole in a pose that's reminiscent of Dancer in yoga. If you've ever tried a pole-dancing class, you likely know that these skills aren't easy, though Larson is making them look like a walk in the park. TBH, we're thinking exactly what one commenter wrote: ""what CAN'T you do????"" Pole dancing looks cool, sure, but it also requires tons of strength in your upper body - namely, in your lats (the big muscles that span most of your back), biceps, shoulders, and hands/forearms (i.e. grip strength). It's understandable why Larson is a natural: In the last few years, she's been working hard on pull-ups, an exercise that also targets all of the aforementioned muscles. Different pole-dancing tricks and inversions will also require a lot from your thighs and core, and help you improve your balance and flexibility. ""Not only are you having to hold your own body weight up on a pole, but add in constantly spinning and changing positions on the pole, and now you are really challenging your body,"" Colleen Freeman, DPT, physical therapist and group fitness instructor, previously told POPSUGAR. ""Not only will your muscles be stronger, but also your vestibular, or balancing system, within your brain will improve."" To Freeman's point, pole dancing isn't a workout you do just for the muscle burn. It's also a very mentally engaging form of exercise since you're continually building new skills and being challenged, as Melanie Hsia, co-owner of pole-dancing studio VRV3 previously told POPSUGAR. Not to mention, it's fun; you're getting to climb, dance, play, and explore moving your body in a totally new way (and, no, it doesn't need to be sexual).

5/17/2022,"An animal dashed down a busy road in Montana and into a cemetery. Jessica Jaeger and her husband, Dylan Heiner, spotted the critter in Butte and knew this wasn’t an animal they had typically seen. “We were driving down a fairly busy road in Butte when he ran out of a neighborhood and into the cemetery,” Jaeger told McClatchy News. “We had no idea what he was because of how he was running, so we followed him.” The couple was experiencing a rare sight. The animal was an elusive and rarely seen wolverine, wildlife officials told McClatchy News. The Montana Standard first reported the May 2 sighting. Wolverine sightings are rare, especially in populated areas, Molly Parks, carnivore coordinator for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks told McClatchy News. “They are typically found in remote, high elevation areas and are solitary and quite elusive,” Parks said in an email. The couple didn’t know it initially, but they did their own research to determine they saw a wolverine. They were blown away. “It felt pretty special since it’s very rare for them to be in town like that,” Jaeger said. Wolverines can be between 38 and 47 inches long, and weigh between 13 and 31 pounds, according to the National Park Service. They’re “active year-round” and breed from April to October, according to the National Park Service. During the winter months, they “den in deep snow.” Wolverines were nearly extinct in Montana in the 1900s but its population has since grown, according to Fish, Wildlife and Parks. Now they can be found in remote locations such as Glacier National Park, the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex and near Yellowstone National Park, according to Lee Enterprises. In March, a tour group at Yellowstone National Park spotted an elusive wolverine walking on the road in front of them, McClatchy News reported. No other vehicles were around, and the tour group spent 3 minutes watching the wolverine. “We turned around to make our way back, when I saw what I thought was a black bear running down the road,” Carl Kemp, a person on the tour, said on YouTube. “As soon as it turned, we realized we were in the middle of a once in a lifetime experience.” One of rarest animals in Yellowstone emerges near ‘elated’ tour group, video shows Wildlife officials capture ‘elusive’ animal only seen eight times in 43 years in Utah Tangle of odd string photographed in Arizona water is hiding eggs.

5/17/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Russia will not get away with trying to redraw Ukraine's borders by creating facts on the ground and waiting out Kyiv and its allies, Olaf Scholz said, insisting that the West would not stand for a ""diktat,"" or dictated, peace forced on the country. Ukraine's President Voldomyr said last week that Kyiv would not trade territory for peace with Russia, telling Italy's RAI television that he had been asked by French President Emmanuel Macron to consider doing so. The French government has denied that any such suggestion had been made. On Monday, Scholz said that such stealth border changes would not be accepted by the West if Ukraine objected to them. ""There is only one way out of this for Russia and that is reaching an agreement with Ukraine,"" he told RTL television. ""And that doesn't mean a diktat peace, taking a bit of territory and then saying 'sign here'. ""And it also won't work as in the case of Crimea, where the war is over in the sense that there is no more shooting, but a new border has been drawn, and then they wait until everything goes back to normal,"" he added. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has since claimed a sovereignty over the Black Sea peninsula. Russia's claim is rejected by Kyiv and all but a handful of other countries. Weapons deliveries to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia's invasion and sanctions against Moscow were designed to make it clear that ""an agreement with Ukraine is unavoidable, and there is no way around this for President (Putin)."" Moscow calls its invasion of Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to rid the country of fascists, an assertion Kyiv and its Western allies say is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.

5/17/2022,"A KFC employee saved the day over the weekend after calling the police when a woman left a note begging for help, according to court records. Diego Glay, 23, is charged with evading arrest and kidnapping after allegedly holding a woman against her will. On May 15, the Memphis Police Department (MPD) responded to a kidnapping/abduction call in the 6200 block of Winchester Road just after 5 p.m. Officers were told by an employee of the KFC that a woman had left a note begging for help and gave a description of the woman and the man with her, the affidavit said. Officers were able to make contact with Diego Glay and the woman who matched the description given by the KFC employee. According to records, Glay refused to obey officers’ commands and took off running. After a short foot chase, the suspect was arrested. The victim told police that Glay had been holding her against her will with physical assaults, threats and being armed with a handgun, records show. The victim said she and Glay had been in a relationship. She also told officers that the suspect had been physically abusive towards her by punching her in the face and when she attempted to leave, she told officers that he took her phone and kept her from leaving his sight for days at a time, the affidavit read. According to officials, the suspect said that he and the victim had been living in cheap, random hotels around the city. Glay is due in court on May 17 and his bond was set at $35,000.

5/17/2022,"By Ali Kucukgocmen ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Swedish and Finnish delegations should not bother coming to Ankara to convince it to approve their NATO bid. Sweden's government has formally decided to apply for NATO membership, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said on Monday, a day after Finnish President Sauli Niinisto confirmed that Helsinki will also apply for membership. Turkey surprised its NATO allies last week by saying it would not view their applications positively, mainly citing their history of hosting members of groups Ankara deems terrorists. In a news conference on Monday, Erdogan repeated that Turkey would not approve their bids to join NATO, calling Sweden a ""hatchery"" for terrorist organisations, and adding it had terrorists in its parliament. ""Neither of these countries have a clear, open attitude towards terrorist organisation,"" Erdogan said. ""How can we trust them?"" The Swedish foreign office said earlier on Monday that senior representatives of Sweden and Finland plan to travel to Turkey for talks to address Ankara's objections. ""They are coming to Turkey on Monday. Are they coming to convince us? Excuse me but they should not tire themselves,"" Erdogan said about the planned visit. Erdogan said NATO would become ""a place where representatives of terrorist organisations are concentrated"" if the two countries join. Ankara says Sweden and Finland harbor people it says are linked to groups it deems terrorists, namely the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group and followers of Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt. Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber said on Monday that Sweden and Finland had not granted approval for the repatriation of 33 people that Turkey requested. Erdogan also said Turkey would oppose the NATO bids from those who imposed sanctions on it. Sweden and Finland had slapped arms export embargoes on Turkey after its Syria incursion in 2019. NATO and the United States said they were confident Turkey would not hold up membership of Finland and Sweden. Diplomats said Erdogan would be under pressure to yield as Finland and Sweden would greatly strengthen NATO in the Baltic Sea. Erdogan's spokesman said on Saturday that Turkey has not shut the door to Sweden and Finland joining NATO but wants negotiations and a clampdown on what it sees as terrorist activities.
