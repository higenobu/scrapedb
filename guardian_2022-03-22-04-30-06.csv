3/22/2022,"Boris Johnson has told nuclear industry bosses that the government wants to the UK to get 25% of its energy from nuclear power, in a move that would signal a significant shift in the country’s energy mix. Johnson on Monday met executives from major nuclear utilities and technology companies including the UK’s Rolls-Royce, France’s EDF, and the US’s Westinghouse and Bechtel to discuss ways of helping to speed up the development of new nuclear power stations. The UK generates about 16% of its power from nuclear power stations, but several reactors are slated for closure, while electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade. That would mean large investments in new power stations would be required just to keep the share of nuclear constant, let alone increase it to a record level of just over a quarter of energy use. Also present at the meeting were a series of big pension companies and insurers, including Aviva, Legal & General and Rothesay Life, alongside major foreign investors including Australia’s Macquarie and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Ministers have wrestled for years with how to attract private capital to invest in nuclear – but companies have balked at putting pension and insurance cash at risk. The government is considering changes to insurance rules set by the EU and copied by the UK to make it easier for insurers and pensions to invest. The UK is switching to a “regulated asset base” model, which it hopes will give long-term investors more certainty on returns, a change it hopes will address limitations to the current rules, known as Solvency II. The government wanted to show the nuclear and investment industries that it had a “clear ambition for more nuclear” in part to balance out intermittent renewable power sources, according to a government source briefed on the discussion. Scrutiny of the government’s energy policies has increased in recent months after unprecedented increases in fossil fuel prices. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added to the pressure, with oil and gas prices surging and western allies considering restricting energy exports as they try to isolate president Vladimir Putin’s regime. The prime minister last week met oil and gas executives to discuss increasing investments in the North Sea, and it is understood that he will next week meet executives from the offshore wind industry to discuss plans for further expansion of renewables. According to an aide who was present at the meeting, Johnson told industry heads and financiers that there had been a “chronic absence” of leadership by successive British governments on nuclear energy and that the country was “being left for dead” by other nations, such as France, on the issue. Speaking after the meeting, Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), said: “Accelerating nuclear projects is absolutely essential to keep energy costs down, cut expensive gas imports and strengthen our energy security as we move towards net zero. “That means urgently investing in a fleet of large and small nuclear stations, alongside renewable investment, to deliver the clean, sovereign power we need.” The UK has struggled to build new nuclear power stations in recent decades, with the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi in 2020 pulling out of plans to build a new reactor at Wylfa, north Wales, and geopolitical tensions making the government less keen on attracting Chinese investment to Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast. Meanwhile the existing nuclear fleet has been in steady decline, with Hunterston B in Scotland retiring earlier this year, Hinkley Point B in Somerset due to follow suit in the summer, and Heysham I and Hartlepool I due to shut down in 2024. At that point, nuclear capacity is expected to fall as low as 3.6GW. A cross-party group of MPs that campaigns on nuclear issues has called for the government to increase its annual nuclear power capacity to 15GW by 2030 and 30GW by 2050, far above the 12.7GW installed at nuclear power’s peak in 1995. Major obstacles include difficulty in securing funding from private investors and a ban on new nuclear projects in Scotland, imposed by the devolved government, which prevents Hunterston B being replaced. The government is examining a plan to revise the financing model for major projects, which was among the factors that scuppered the Wylfa project in north Wales. Under plans for Sizewell being discussed by Whitehall officials and EDF, the government could take a stake in a development company that will push it through various stages of planning and bureaucracy, sharing the costs with EDF. Private sector investors such as the insurance funds L&G and Aviva would then be lured in at a later stage in return for a government-backed funding model called the regulated asset base (RAB), diluting the taxpayer and EDF. Legislation on RAB funding – the same model used to fund airports such as Heathrow and water companies – is due to progress through parliament next month.",News/Environment,Johnson announces aim for UK to get 25% of energy from nuclear power ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/21/johnson-announces-aim-for-uk-to-get-25-of-energy-from-nuclear-power
3/22/2022,"It was standing room only in the Macmillan room of Portcullis House. The first press conference to be given by Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe since her release from detention in Iran was not something to be missed. For six years, Nazanin had been a silent figure in an ongoing political drama. Now we were to get a voice to put to a name and photograph. She was to be even more impressive than any of us had imagined. First, though, it was Tulip Siddiq, Nazanin and her husband Richard’s MP, who took centre stage. Having paid tribute to her constituents, she cut to the chase. Given it had taken the repayment of an acknowledged debt to secure Nazanin’s release, what had taken the UK government so long? And why had we detained three Iranians who had come to London in 2013 to negotiate the terms of the repayment? Surely that had only encouraged Iran to think taking hostages was the only way to get its money back. Richard Ratcliffe just sounded pleased to be taking a back seat at last. The six years seem to have taken a harsher physical toll on him than they have on his wife. He’s aged noticeably. His hair’s greyer and thinner, his face more lined and his wife joked about him having put on weight after a hunger strike. Meanwhile Nazanin looks little changed from the grainy images of her arrest at Tehran airport in 2016. Her scars are all on the inside and are not on the table for public consumption. “It’s nice to be retiring from campaigning,” he said, holding on to his wife’s hand. For his own support, rather than hers. Tabloid portrayals of Nazanin as some powerless victim caught up in a story of global realpolitik have proved well wide of the mark. She’s a strong, powerful independent woman. Someone who knows her own mind and lives life on her own terms. You can mess with her, but you can’t break her. Richard went on to say he had spent much of the past six years in a state of waiting. Now he was going to have to get used to being. He ended by saying he was in awe of his wife. As were we all. Nazanin – dressed in the yellow and blue of Ukraine – began by thanking her family, both in the UK and Iran, before going on to say that her freedom would never be total until other detainees – such as Morad Tahbaz, whose eldest daughter, Roxanne, was also at the presser – were also released. Despite having promised to release Morad on furlough, the Iranians had already put him back in prison. One person’s illegal detention diminishes us all. It was an expression of humanity and selflessness. Then she let rip. A very controlled fury. Icy, almost steely. We had been warned Nazanin wouldn’t be making any overtly political remarks and that any such statements would be left to Richard and Siddiq. Only no one appeared to have told Nazanin. She wasn’t going to settle for anything cosy and heart-warming. It wasn’t her job to make the rest of the country feel better about itself. So while she loved her husband to bits, she couldn’t go along with his expressions of thanks to the government. How many foreign secretaries had it taken to get her home? It had taken five when it should have been just the one. She should have been home six years ago. Her daughter had been two when she was detained. Now she was nearly eight. No one could give her back the years that had been lost. But that was as much as Nazanin was prepared to let the media see of her true feelings. The rest was for her and her family alone. She wasn’t going to emote for the hell of it. She wasn’t a performing seal. She was a woman with her integrity and sanity to maintain. Nazanin had spent six years practising how to compartmentalise her emotions and she wasn’t about to stop now. So she declined to answer how she had coped in her darkest hours. Or what her true feelings for her captors had been. Instead, she played it straight. There had been times of despair. Many times she had been led to think her release was imminent only to be let down. So she had learned not to trust anyone or anything. It was only when she was on the plane out of Iran that she allowed herself to believe she would be reunited with her family. And no, she was not going to let herself hold a grudge. She should never have been detained but she couldn’t let that destroy her efforts to rebuild a family life. To enjoy the little things, like brushing her daughter Gabriella’s hair. “I have tried to leave the black hole in my heart on the plane,” she said. As for Boris Johnson, whose careless words had made her situation incomparably worse, she had never given him the satisfaction of letting him see how much damage he had done. She had known she was powerless in prison so gave little thought to politics. And when she only had 40 minutes with Gabriella, she wanted to spend the time on colouring and reading stories. Not giving in to her contempt for someone who never really gave her a second thought. Not many could show such grace under fire. With that, the press conference ended and Nazanin, Richard and Gabriella made their way out the room. After living out of a suitcase for the best part of a week, they were finally going home together for the first time in years. To get to know each other properly once more. Meanwhile, back at the foreign affairs select committee, Philip Barton, permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, was being questioned about the discrepancy between his testimony and that of a whistleblower who had said that the prime minister had prioritised the evacuation of Pen Farthing and His Pets from Afghanistan over Afghan interpreters. Nazanin might ruefully have concluded that she would have been better off being a cockapoo. That way she might have caught the Suspect’s attention and been home years ago.",News/News,Nazanin’s ice-cold anger debunks government’s happy ending narrative | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/21/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-press-conference
3/22/2022,"Fuel retailers have dismissed accusations that they have been slow to reduce prices at the pump to reflect a recent fall in their own wholesale costs, as petrol and diesel hit new records on UK forecourts. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is under pressure to cut fuel duty during his spring statement on Wednesday, at which the rising cost of living is likely to take centre stage. In the latest squeeze on household budgets, petrol hit a new high of 167p per litre on Sunday, while diesel reached 179p, according to figures from Experian Catalist. Oil prices had soared in recent weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but have since eased somewhat, prompting the AA to accuse fuel retailers of dragging their feet on passing on the reduction. “Wholesale petrol and diesel costs started to fall away dramatically on 9 March, yet more than 10 days later prices at the pumps continue to set new records,” said Luke Bosdet, an AA spokesperson. “Even with oil rebounding to $110 a barrel at the end of last week, wholesale petrol on Friday was down 12p a litre on the 8 March peak.” However, Gordon Balmer, the executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents independent forecourt owners, said the criticism was unfair because wholesale markets for petrol and diesel had fluctuated, rather than falling in line with the declining oil price. “The market is all over the place at the moment, it’s so volatile,” he said. “We’re not ripping the public off.” He said fuel retailers were making very little margin on diesel, if any, because high wholesale costs were not being fully passed on at the pump. While Sunak is under pressure to cut fuel duty, experts argue such a measure could disproportionately aid wealthier people, pointing to research looking at the impact of such moves in the European Union. EU fuel duty cuts will cost European taxpayers €9bn (£7.5bn), according to analysis by the campaign group Transport & Environment shared with the Guardian. It showed the wealthiest households would gain the most, because they were more likely to drive more and to own larger cars that consume more petrol or diesel. The richest 10% of EU households spent eight times more on fuel than the bottom 10%, with the UK exhibiting a similar divide, they said. Griffin Carpenter, a cars analyst at T&E, said: “EU governments claim they stand with Ukraine, but instead of taxing Russian oil, they’re subsidising it with €9bn of taxpayers’ money. “There are better ways governments can help people. We could impose a tariff or tax on Russian oil imports right now. “Instead of subsidising the wealthy drivers of gas-guzzling cars, cash support could be distributed more fairly to families who actually need it.”",Lifestyle/Money,Fuel retailers defend high costs at UK pumps after drop in oil prices,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/21/fuel-retailers-defend-high-costs-at-uk-pumps-after-drop-in-oil-prices
3/22/2022,"Raising taxes on petrol and diesel is an important policy that governments can use to put the brakes on runaway climate change. However, it appears that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, wants to accelerate rather than slow the pace of planetary damage. In this week’s mini-budget, he looks likely to announce a temporary 5p per litre reduction on fuel duty. This could cut the cost of filling an average family car by around £2.75 and might help some who have suffered as pump prices jumped in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, this is a false economy. Even with the pandemic lockdowns, transport remained the largest emitting sector, responsible for 24% of all UK greenhouse gas emissions. Cutting fuel duty flies in the face of the government’s claim to be a green leader. It is also a regressive measure. The New Economics Foundation says that only 7% of the savings from cutting fuel duty will go to the poorest fifth of households – while one-third will go to the richest fifth. If he were to go ahead with the policy, Mr Sunak would be handing money to people in proportion to how much they drive and how fuel-inefficient their car was. Labour has supported Mr Sunak. This is a triumph of political expediency over the environment. Neither party thinks it can afford to upset a significant number of voters. Polls suggest that an election held today would result in a government without a parliamentary majority. If the government did cut fuel duty as suggested, the Treasury could lose about £4bn a year in tax receipts. Surely, it would be better for the government to spend such sums on stepping up investment in secure, clean energy such as solar and onshore wind or to fund policies that reduce energy demand in homes and industry. Short-term costs to the Treasury translate into much larger long-term benefits for the country, by staving off the climate emergency. Reducing taxes on fuel would simply make the UK more dependent on Russia, which supplies 13% of all diesel. By contrast, the thinktank E3G suggests that energy efficiency measures for homes could cut Russian gas imports by 80% this year. This would see households, on average, be between £130 and £170 a year better off. Combined with a renewables drive, E3G says the UK could eliminate Russia from its gas supply completely in 2022. While growth will be lower and inflation higher than expected, Mr Sunak has cash to spend – even within the Treasury’s self-imposed fiscal rules. Goldman Sachs, Mr Sunak’s former employer, says that the government will have “between £45bn and £75bn of fiscal headroom”. The investment bank thinks that Mr Sunak will focus on levelling up the country and, given the war in Ukraine, boost the UK defence budget by £9bn. Ministers could be more imaginative by, say, introducing cheap, or even free, public transport – such as the scheme introduced in Estonia’s capital, Tallinn, or that being trialled in Boston in the US. If Mr Sunak wanted such policies to be fiscally neutral, he could tax car drivers and use the cash to fund public transport. Fuel duty has not increased since 2010. During this period the volume of traffic has grown, producing more air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing costs for motorists is politically difficult because it involves political risk. But not increasing costs for them risks ruining the planet.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on fuel duty cuts: expediency over the environment | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/21/the-guardian-view-on-fuel-duty-cuts-expediency-over-the-environment
