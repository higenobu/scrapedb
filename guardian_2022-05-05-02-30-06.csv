5/5/2022,"There is a limit to the number of times any product can be relaunched before it becomes clear that the basic design is flawed. That is also true of governments. Boris Johnson is braced for a poor Tory performance in Thursday’s local council elections and is determined to move on briskly. A new parliamentary session opens next week, giving the opportunity to set out the government’s agenda in a Queen’s speech. There is also talk of a ministerial reshuffle to freshen the appearance of the cabinet. That will have limited effect, since Mr Johnson will not sack himself. He might still usefully replace some of his underperforming ministers. Top of that list is Priti Patel. The home secretary might not be the least competent person in cabinet (though she has a claim to the title), but her department is one where poor leadership has some of the most drastic consequences. Ms Patel presides over a dysfunctional, demoralised bureaucracy that is neither capable of managing the nation’s borders to meet the demands of Conservative voters nor of implementing humane refugee policies to meet the requirements of human decency. Mr Johnson is clearly not bothered by the moral implications of Ms Patel’s increasingly callous policies towards desperate people crossing the Channel in small boats. He might yet lose patience with her inability to make any of the schemes work. In the meantime, the programme for accepting Ukrainian refugees is a shambles, imposing cruel uncertainty and spiteful administrative caprice on a category of migrants towards whom the government, unusually, has an official policy of compassion. A new home secretary might at least put that notional sliver of generosity to effective use. But the underlying problem is systemic across government. It derives from a failure to distinguish between the announcement of a plan and its enactment. The agenda for government is written with an eye on the following morning’s headlines, without regard for what is required in delivery. There is little distinction between a slogan and a policy. That has been the fate of “levelling up” – a concept that was meant to define the purpose of Mr Johnson’s administration post-Brexit, but that still lacks meaningful content. There will be lavish use of the phrase in the Queen’s speech. But in the absence of a structured economic plan for regional rehabilitation or any courage in the Treasury to use tax-and-spend levers to finance ambitious social policy, voters will notice only the downward levelling imposed by a cost-of-living crisis. That failure cannot be remedied by a change of chancellor – a prospect widely discussed as a way for the prime minister to signal a change of direction. The reality is that Mr Johnson himself is the origin of the malaise. It is the prime minister’s lack of focus and principle that leaves the government bereft of a coherent agenda or a purpose other than sustaining the career of the man in No 10. When appointment to the cabinet requires willingness to indulge Mr Johnson’s serial dishonesties and flatter his rhetorical inanities, it is hardly surprising that the calibre of ministers is low. This weakness can also be traced back to Brexit – a project that achieved electoral success by stirring economic grievance while making remedies harder. The consequence is a government more skilled at causing diversions when things go wrong than it is capable of putting them right. It is a method with diminishing returns. Mr Johnson’s cabinet badly needs upgrading with some competent administrators. But the prime minister is running out of people to blame for his personal failures, and voters have lost patience with his excuses.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on government drift: the rot starts at the top | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/04/the-guardian-view-on-government-drift-the-rot-starts-at-the-top
5/5/2022,"Cinderella will not, after all, be going to the ball. The big new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, with its book by Emerald Fennell, has been cancelled, less than a year into its run. The cast and crew were told the news in person over the weekend, but a similar courtesy was not accorded to all the actors due to take over roles, some of whom found out that they faced sudden unemployment by social media, or via text messages from concerned friends, while notes to their agents sat unread over the bank holiday weekend. It was shabby, and it should have been done better. It is a cruel irony that they were treated thus after the pandemic cast such clear light on the fragility of the livelihoods of self-employed creative workers. Cinderella is a clear reminder of the perils of mounting a West End show. The risks would be unacceptably high to businesses operating in most other fields; investors are wise to be lovers of the art form rather than hard-nosed lovers of the bottom line. There is a long and inglorious history of West End flops that looked viable enough on paper: Lord of the Rings, in 2007, cost £25m and closed after a year; the Spice Girls jukebox musical, Viva Forever, which had a script by Jennifer Saunders and was produced by Mamma Mia!’s Judie Craymer, lasted only six months. The costs of putting on a show are enormous, and the returns slow and uncertain. Recouping the investment is predicated on box-office sales – themselves dependent on the fickle, intangible and largely unpredictable magic of artistic alchemy, and whether a show just happens to catch the public mood. Lord Lloyd-Webber led the charge to refill West End theatres last summer. Owning such venues, as he does through his company LW Theatres, makes sense if you are able to fill them, especially with your own work (finding slots in big West End houses is one of the perennial challenges for producers mounting these big, expensive shows). But, empty during the pandemic, his seven stages were costing £1m a week, he told the Guardian last year. Despite his gung-ho attitude to getting shows back on – perhaps unwise given the projected length and depth of the pandemic – the premiere of Cinderella was delayed, derailed by last summer’s “pingdemic”. After it finally opened to excellent reviews in late August, Britain was already slipping towards another sharp rise in cases and then the emergence of the Omicron variant, which closed theatres down again. It has been a rough ride. The closure of Cinderella – it may fare better on Broadway, where it is headed – is also a reminder of the long tail of Covid, which may have created the most difficult and uncertain period for the performing arts since the 1665 plague shut London’s playhouses. Some hoped that the economic disruption would precipitate more fairness and equality in the way cultural workers are employed. Like many hopes of change to come out of the pandemic, that seems overly optimistic. But the least producers could do is treat their employees with courtesy.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the West End: a perilous business | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-west-end-a-perilous-business
5/5/2022,"Two elderly American anti-war activists described as “the nicest and most courteous protesters” have each been fined €5,000 by an Irish court for interfering with operations at Shannon airport, which hosts US military flights. A Dublin circuit criminal court judge issued the penalties on Wednesday a day after Tarak Kauff, 80, and Ken Mayers, 85, were convicted of interfering with the operation, safety or management of an airport by entering the runway area and causing the airport to close. The pair, who had both served in the US military, used bolt cutters to gain access to the airport on St Patrick’s day in 2019 and walked on to a taxiway in an attempt to search US military planes for weapons. They had a banner and wore high-vis vests emblazoned with the words “veterans for peace”. The intrusion caused the airport to close for about 40 minutes, delaying the departure of two planes and the landing of a cargo plane. Richard Moloney, a former police fire officer at the airport, told the trial the men fully cooperated when he accosted them. “These were the nicest and most courteous protesters I ever met in my 19 years in Shannon airport.” Pat Keating, a police officer who was in charge at Shannon garda station, told the court that Mayers and Kauff were “the best custodians I’ve had in 25 years”. Kauff, speaking after sentencing, defended the protest. “No regrets at all about that action. The only regret I might have is that we might have done more. We thought there was an absolute necessity to do this.” Peace campaigners have long complained that US military flights with troops and weapons refuel at the County Clare airport on the Atlantic coast despite Ireland’s military neutrality. Kauff, a former army private from New York, and Mayers, a former marine major from New Mexico, became peace activists in the 1960s and are members of a group called Veterans for Peace. They spent 13 days in prison and were obliged to spend nine months in Ireland pending the trial, during which they became minor celebrities in the country. A jury acquitted them on charges of trespass and criminal damage and returned a guilty verdict on the lesser charge of interfering with the airport. In issuing the fines, Judge Patricia Ryan said she considered mitigating factors such as the men’s cooperation, age and lack of previous convictions. Kauff said he would return to the US satisfied at having shined a light on US military flights. “Our purpose was to expose the hypocrisy and violation of Irish neutrality and that’s what we did.”",News/World news,Two ‘courteous’ US anti-war veterans in their 80s fined for interfering at an Irish airport,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/two-courteous-us-anti-war-veterans-in-their-80s-fined-for-interfering-at-an-irish-airport
5/5/2022,"Shareholders dealt an embarrassing blow to Barclays’ climate credentials on Wednesday, with almost 20% rejecting the bank’s climate strategy as activists disrupted its annual meeting to protest against the bank’s financing of fossil fuels. Barclays said on Wednesday that 19.19% of voting shareholders were against the bank’s climate strategy, which set out its plans and progress towards goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Nearly 11% also opposed the bank’s pay policy, after influential proxy shareholder adviser Glass Lewis raised concerns over the pay packet for its new chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan, which includes fixed pay worth £2.7m and a long-term incentive plan worth up to 140% of his salary (around £3.8m). It capped an embarrassing annual meeting for the bank, where climate activists groups, including Extinction Rebellion and offshoot Money Rebellion, set off alarms and glued themselves to chairs in order to avoid being removed from the Manchester Central Convention Complex. Shareholders also disrupted the annual meeting held by Standard Chartered in London, amid concerns over the banking group’s climate track record.

Campaigners at Extinction Rebellion claim Barclays has continued to invest heavily in fossil fuels – having put $19.6bn into the industry in 2021 – while protesters accused the lender of “greenwashing”. Higgins, who became increasingly exasperated as interruptions continued, told protesters that the bank would not promise to immediately halt investment in fossil fuels, but insisted that Barclays was committed to hit net zero emissions targets. 🚨BREAKING: ‘End Fossil Fuels Now!’ XR disrupt @Barclays @StanChart AGMs​​​​​​🚨@Barclays UK’s largest investor in #fossilfuels $19.6 Billion in 2021😱@StanChart financed $6 Billion in 2021, 3rd biggest investment behind Barclays & HSBC 😡https://t.co/AYeFUiHVii pic.twitter.com/lfYUUuCBCp “We get the point.

5/5/2022,"Aidan O’Brien put at least a temporary brake on the Charlie Appleby bandwagon here on Wednesday, as a 33-1 double in the afternoon’s Classic trials improved his hand for both the Derby and Oaks while putting a large dent in the Derby credentials of New London, beaten at 4-11 behind Changingoftheguard in the Group Three Chester Vase. New London, in Godolphin blue like all of Appleby’s runners, went into the race unbeaten in two starts and on offer at around 5-1 second-favourite for the Derby on 4 June. Two-and-a-half minutes and one comprehensive defeat later, he was out to 16-1, having visibly failed to answer the questions that the Roodee poses to an inexperienced three-year-old. “No excuses,” William Buick, his rider, said afterwards. “He’s still got a lot to learn.” Changingoftheguard, by contrast, was sent straight into the lead by Ryan Moore and pounded around Chester without a second thought, eventually pulling six-and-a-half lengths clear at the line. He is now top-priced at 12-1 (from 50-1) for the Epsom Classic, in a market headed by his stable companion, Luxembourg, who finished third in the 2,000 Guineas last Saturday. “We were delighted with that run,” O’Brien said from Ireland afterwards. “I think off the back of that, you’d have to say he’d go to Epsom now.” Luxembourg and Changingoftheguard are unlikely to be O’Brien’s only Derby entries, as the stable expects to be represented in all the major Epsom trials over the coming days at Chester, Lingfield, Leopardstown and York. The Ballydoyle squad for the Oaks also received a boost as Thoughts Of June, a 7-1 chance, kept finding more on the run-in to beat Above The Curve – trained by his son, Joseph O’Brien – in the Listed Cheshire Oaks. Above The Curve, a warm favourite, looked likely to run down Thoughts Of June in the final furlong but she too showed her lack of experience as the winner – who finished nearly three lengths behind the favourite last time – stayed on strongly to the line. Thoughts Of June is now top-priced at 16-1 (from 66-1) for the Oaks, another Classic in an O’Brien-trained runner – Tuesday, in this case – heads the market after finishing third in the Guineas at Newmarket. “I thought she’d come forward for that [her first run of the season] and she clearly did,” O’Brien said. “We’d been thinking of the Oaks for her and that was the reason for sending her to Chester, to see if she’d handle it and to teach her plenty.” The Group Three Ormonde Stakes at Chester on Thursday has bucked the recent trend for small fields with a double-figure turnout for the first time since 2008. It will be interesting to see how the lightly-raced Hamish, the Melrose winner at York three seasons ago, kicks off his six-year-old career and he still has enough time and potential to make a mark at a high level this year. He is giving weight to all nine of his rivals after 185 days off, however, and the classy mares Believe In Love and Albaflora (3.10) make more appeal for betting purposes. Both finished within a neck of the winner at Group One level last season winners and have scope for further improvement at five, but the fact that Albaflora was a winner first time up in 2021 tips the balance her way.

Night On Earth is in stall four but trapped like a greyhound when third in a strongly-run race at Newmarket last time and that may give him the edge. Worcester 1.50 A few of these chasers have questions to answer about recent form or fitness, so Gallow Ford looks big at around 6-1 to make a successful debut over fences. Chester 2.05 Of the nine runners Spacer is the outsider in the early betting at around 16-1 and his fitness needs to be taken on trust, but he ran well first time up last year in what turned out to be strong contest and has the excellent Laura Pearson taking off a useful 3lb.

Aidan O’Brien’s Derby entry Star Of India is the obvious danger but seems to be priced up as much on his trainer’s record in this race – six wins in the past nine – as his form. Chester 3.40 Enfranchise improved significantly for the return to turf last time and, though she has a tough draw to overcome, that may be less of a hindrance at this trip (three winners of this race in eight years have come from double-figure stalls).",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: New London’s Derby hopes dented by Changingoftheguard,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/04/changingoftheguard-wins-in-chester-to-dent-new-londons-derby-hopes
5/5/2022,"When Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray last stared each other down on a tennis court in 2017, the period signified a slight shift in the dynamic of their longtime rivalry. They were born a week apart, they had known each other from childhood and they both broke through on the ATP at exactly the same time, yet Djokovic had been the higher-ranked player in every single one of their first 34 professional meetings. It took the season of Murray’s life in 2016 for him to finally, fleetingly, stand above Djokovic, usurping him as the No 1 at the close of the season. In hindsight, though, it took everything. A few months later, Murray’s hip deteriorated. After just a brief spell as an equal of Djokovic, he has spent the past five years simply trying to find a way to play high-level tennis again without pain. In that same period, meanwhile, Djokovic ploughed on, elevating his status from a legend, then to arguably the greatest player, winning eight more grand slam titles. On Thursday in the third round of the Madrid Open, the pair will meet for the 37th time under completely different circumstances. Despite his contrasting fortunes, Djokovic is far from the apex of his powers. After sitting out almost all of the first three months of the year due to his unvaccinated status, his return has been difficult. Not only has rust coated his game, but he has struggled badly with his conditioning. It is only a matter of time before Djokovic recovers his level and his simple 6-3, 6-2 win against Gaël Monfils in his first match, which extended their head-to-head to a record 18-0, was a helpful start. After his victory, even before his third-round opponent was certain, Djokovic noted Murray’s improved movement while reflecting on his past successes. “He’s one of the most important names that we have,” Djokovic said. “To have him still compete is great, and to have him even play at the high level as the time goes by is impressive, considering the surgery and what he has been through in the last few years. His resilience and fighting spirit is really inspiring.” This has been quite a frustrating year for Murray so far, filled with innumerable wildcards and second round losses, often when he meets his first seeded opponent. After another second-round defeat in Miami, Murray took a four-week training block on clay, working hard on his movement and officially joining forces with Ivan Lendl again. Initially, Murray had not planned to compete in the clay court season at all, but after opting to take a wildcard into Madrid, the fruits of his work has been clear. Against Denis Shapovalov in the early hours of Wednesday morning, he closed off his best win of the season brilliantly. His returning was tremendous, he found big serves under pressure, he moved as well as Djokovic observed and he confounded Shapovalov with his deep toolbox of shots. Whether he has improved enough to have an impact against the best player in the world remains to be seen, but as Murray reminded viewers in an interview with Amazon Prime, the mere fact that this match-up exists again, and that Murray defeated a top-20 player to set it up once more, is a considerable achievement in itself. “He’s the world No 1 and I’ve got a metal hip,” Murray said. “I didn’t know I’d get opportunities to play matches like this again. In theory I shouldn’t have a chance in the match. But I’ve worked my hardest, put myself in a great position and it’s a fantastic opportunity to play against him again on a big court in a huge tournament.” On Wednesday, British success in Madrid continued as Dan Evans recovered from a perilous deficit to defeat Roberto Bautista Agut 6-3, 5-7, 7-6(2). Bautista Agut led by 4-2 and 0-40 on Evans’s serve in the third set, then 5-3, but Evans recovered to clinch the match on a tiebreak Cameron Norrie followed Evans into the third round soon after, outplaying John Isner 6-4, 6-7 (5), 6-4. In the women’s draw, Ons Jabeur marked herself as the player to beat after she dismantled the former champion Simona Halep 6-3, 6-2 to reach the semi-final.",Sport/Sport,Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic ready to cross swords after five-year gap,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/04/andy-murray-and-novak-djokovic-ready-to-cross-swords-after-five-year-gap
5/5/2022,"While I agree with Neal Lawson about the fundamental need for electoral reform (The Tories are terrified of a Labour-Lib Dem pact – and they’re right to be, 2 May), it is dangerous to assume that withdrawing Westminster candidates will gain extra seats for “progressive” parties. Instead, some disenfranchised supporters will stay at home, as has happened in hitherto safe Labour seats, or vote Conservative, rather than lending their support to the remaining candidate. Thus I am standing for election this week to give people the opportunity to vote for the Liberal Democrats in the East Barnet ward of Barnet council in London. Only a formal electoral pact and manifesto could try to get round this problem, or the introduction of either the single transferable vote or open-list multi-member consistencies for general elections. Both systems empower electors to have a much greater influence on who gets to represent them, and remove our first-past-the-post electoral monopolies. Indeed, at local election counts, to elect two or three councillors for each ward, you see some surprising combinations and permutations of split votes. Ballot papers have to be read out and laboriously tallied on charts to confirm that they add up correctly before being combined with block votes for all the candidates from the same party standing in that ward. This takes nearly as long to count as the single transferable vote being used for Scottish local elections.David NowellEast Barnet, London  In this week’s local council elections, it appears that the Liberal Democrats in my ward have done a pact with the Green party. There are three seats available and the Lib Dems are fielding two candidates, while the Greens are fielding one. This is great! It means I can vote Lib Dem and Green without worrying about letting a Tory in through the back door. In a neighbouring ward, the contest is between the Lib Dems and the Tories, with Labour an outlier instead of the Green party. Labour should have done the same deal with the Lib Dems as they did in my ward, fielding one candidate in return for the Lib Dems fielding two, guaranteeing that the Conservatives would be locked out and actually netting themselves a councillor. But Labour fielded three candidates and the Lib Dems have followed suit. Labour will probably scratch their heads as to why they continue to have almost zero councillors in my area and, worse, may even let a Tory in by splitting the left-of-centre vote. I think Labour still have the attitude that they are the second party in the UK, even though they’ve lost Scotland and much of the north of England, and cling on to urban areas only. Labour needs to start working with other left-leaning parties until such time as first past the post is replaced with proportional representation.William BartramHampton, London  “Keir Starmer has successfully stabilised his party’s position by neutralising the most voter-repellent properties of Corbynism,” writes Rafael Behr (Boris Johnson has lost the Tories’ respect – so why has he not lost their support?, 4 May). It is worth pointing out that in the 2017 general election, under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, the Labour party vote share was 40%, greater than in 2005 under Tony Blair (35.2%). In both 2017 and 2019, Corbyn’s vote share was greater than Gordon Brown’s in 2010 and Ed Miliband’s in 2015.

Our multi-academy trust comprises special, alternative and mainstream provision. We also have an outreach team that works with children and teachers in many mainstream primary and secondary schools across two local authorities. We are finding that almost every child at risk of exclusion (or who has been excluded) has a special educational need of some kind, and the challenging behaviour being exhibited will be a manifestation of this. The only way to deal with this effectively is to focus on the underlying issues. This means early intervention, diagnosis and an education healthcare plan (EHCP) where appropriate, to ensure the child can access the right support in a setting that’s right for them. But this is not easy, as it now takes longer than ever before to get an EHCP. This is partly due to a shortage of specialists such as educational psychologists and speech and language therapists, as well as the significant increase in the number of children with complex needs. The recent special educational needs and disabilities green paper recognises many of these issues, so we are hopeful for improvement.

I replied to all of them to weed out the women who were more than 12 weeks pregnant and advised them to go the UK. I remember that the majority of the letters were from other states. They were mostly from women who had more children than they could manage. Many were Roman Catholic and their husbands refused to let them use contraception. Very few were teenagers, though the common perception at the time was that only promiscuous young women wanted to use the services.

5/5/2022,"Aparty leader attempting to get their message out ahead of local elections only to be frustrated by repeated questions about Covid breaches during lockdown. This was how Tory and Labour strategists alike expected Boris Johnson’s electoral campaign to play out. Only with one day to go until polling day, it’s actually Keir Starmer on the receiving end. These days the Labour leader can’t get through an interview without being pressed on “Beergate” – an incident last April when he was pictured drinking a beer indoors in Durham with Labour staff while the rest of England was under stage 2 Covid rules (meaning no socialising outside of your own household or bubble). Starmer has insisted that all rules were followed and that it was a work event. However, the Tories are on a campaign to draw equivalence between that event and the birthday cake event that Johnson and his chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined over. Richard Holden, the MP for North West Durham and a former political adviser, is leading efforts to get the police to re-examine the case (after they found there had been no wrongdoing earlier this year). On Tuesday’s Today programme Starmer refused not once but four times to say whether Durham police had been back in touch over the event. On Wednesday‘s Good Morning Britain he confirmed the police had not contacted him and offered a full account of the night, insisting curry was ordered as restaurants were closed and people “at various points” ate the curry and “got on with their work”. It doesn’t help matters that Labour has had to change its line regarding Angela Rayner’s attendance at the event. Starmer’s frustration at the line of questioning is clear for all to see. But for the Tories, Beergate couldn’t come at a better time. On the WhatsApp group of loyal Boris Johnson supporters – set up at the peak of Partygate to bolster support for the prime minister – “Labour hypocrisy” is the discussion point of the day – with MPs encouraging one another to push it. The culture secretary, and Johnson loyalist, Nadine Dorries has been out on the front foot – declaring on social media: “The man who wants to one day be Prime Minister cannot behave like this. He has a responsibility to be open, honest and transparent with the public #Beergate.” For the bulk of Tory MPs, there is little equivalence between Starmer drinking a beer and the most serious allegations against the prime minister from an alleged party in the No 10 flat to the infamous BYOB bash in the garden. This is in part why when the story first emerged earlier this year it gained little traction. However, the fact that the only event Johnson has been fined for so far involved a birthday cake between work meetings, means that MPs in the centre of the party are now willing to embrace it. There’s a sense that Starmer has overplayed his hand. When Johnson and Sunak received a fixed penalty notice for attending an event at work with birthday cake between meetings, he was quick to call for both the prime minister and the chancellor to resign. “He called for the chancellor to resign when he was five minutes early to a meeting,” says a Tory MP in the centre of the party. “They set their own bar and now they have fallen victim to it.” Another reason Tory aides are pushing the story so hard is that it’s helping to neuter Labour’s Partygate attacks. Labour politicians appearing in the media are far more likely to focus on other issues – such as the cost of living – for fear of being questioned about beergate if they try and go on Johnson’s Covid rule breaking. For the Tory party, the most important thing the row has done is given MPs something to say on Partygate. Other than ultra loyalists, the bulk of MPs have been staying silent on the issue of parties for fear of more coming out – whether that’s further fines or an embarrassing photo. Now they have a holding position – they can partake in a good bit of “whataboutery” in the hope it will leave some voters to conclude that they will simply stay at home rather than cast an anti-Tory protest vote. It’s a line that has its limits. “It’s essentially: ‘all politicians are as bad as each other’,” says a senior Tory. It could also soon be out of date if fines for more serious events come up the track – such as the alleged Downing Street flat party (the event that worries government aides most). But for now, with the Tories braced for a dismal showing on Thursday, anything that derails or dampens Starmer’s efforts is the order of the day.

5/5/2022,"Book now How much impact have humans had on the planet, really? What are the key things that need to change to tackle the climate crisis, and can we actually make a difference by introducing small changes into our lives? Gaining an understanding of the state of our natural world can feel overwhelming, especially as so much of it is underwritten with doom. In this three-week class, hosted by Mark Maslin, the professor of Earth System Science at University College London, you will get to the core of the biggest issues facing the planet, including where they’ve come from, why they are so difficult to reverse, and how we can try. In each of these three fascinating sessions, Mark will deliver an opening keynote and then hand over to our special guest speakers, as they delve into a specific topic and answer your questions. Hear from the Guardian’s journalists, environmental activists and scientific experts on the state of the climate crisis, and – crucially – how things might change for the better. Mark will discuss how human societies have evolved over time, and what role we have played in altering our natural environment throughout the course of history. This will be followed by Steve Trent, the CEO and founder of the Environmental Justice Foundation, who will share their work with communities around the world who are facing the true brunt of the climate crisis. What does the latest scientific research tell us? Mark begins by digging into reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and will discuss the pertinence of tipping points. Then, the Guardian’s environment correspondent Fiona Harvey will talk about the biggest issues and what must change – from deeply-rooted issues within our society, to how our economy needs to evolve to become more sustainable. The practical actions you can take now in order to reduce your negative impact on our planet, with Mark. After, Sacha Wright, the research and curriculum coordinator for Force of Nature, will share data-led insights into how young people are responding to the climate crisis. Lastly, the Guardian’s writer Damien Gayle, who has reported on the ground with Extinction Rebellion, will discuss the rise of collective, global movements and the power of protest.

5/5/2022,"Chad Wolf, Donald Trump’s acting secretary of homeland security, interfered with a report on Russian interference in the 2020 election by demanding changes, delaying its dissemination and creating a risk the report might be seen as politicised, a government watchdog said. Eventually declassified in March 2021, the report was a summary of foreign election interference into the 2020 election. It found that, as one headline put it, “Russia tried to help Trump in 2020, Iran tried to hurt him and China stayed out of it”. But before it was released, and two months before the election, an analyst in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) complained that Wolf, as well as his predecessor Kirstjen Nielsen and the deputy secretary, Ken Cuccinelli, had interfered with the report. According to the whistleblower, in mid-May 2020 Wolf instructed him “to cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the United States, and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran”. The analyst also said that in July 2020 he was ordered to delay the report because it “made the president look bad”. At the time, a DHS spokesman “flatly denied” the claim. On Tuesday, the office of the DHS inspector general released its own report. It found that DHS “did not adequately follow its internal processes and comply with applicable intelligence community policy standards and requirements when editing and disseminating an Office of Intelligence and Analysis [I&A] intelligence product regarding Russian interference in the 2020 US presidential election”. DHS employees, it said, “changed the product’s scope by making changes that appear to be based in part on political considerations”. Such changes, the report said, included the insertion of a “tone box” about China and Iran. “Additionally, the acting secretary [Wolf] participated in the review process multiple times despite lacking any formal role in reviewing the product, resulting in the delay of its dissemination on at least one occasion. “The delays and deviation from I&A’s standard process and requirements [risked] creating a perception of politicisation. This conclusion is supported by I&A’s own tradecraft assessment, which determined that the product might be viewed as politicised.” Wolf is now head of the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump thinktank. He told NBC News the watchdog “did not find any credible evidence that I directed anyone to change the substance of the report because it ‘made President Trump look bad’”. He also said it was “buried in the report … that the grossly false whistleblower complaint against me was withdrawn”. The withdrawal, “pursuant to an agreement with DHS”, is dealt with on page nine of 42 in the watchdog report. On page 11, the watchdog says: “Based on our interviews with relevant officials, as well as our document review, it is clear the acting secretary asked the acting USIA [under secretary for intelligence and analysis] to hold the product from its pending release. “We interviewed the acting USIA, who told us the acting secretary asked the product be held because it made President Trump look bad and hurt President Trump’s campaign – the concept that Russia was denigrating candidate Biden would be used against President Trump. “The acting USIA also told us he took contemporaneous notes of the meeting, a copy of which we obtained. The notes … read ‘AS1 – will hurt POTUS – kill it per his authorities’. “The acting USIA told us these notes meant that the acting secretary told him to hold the product because it would hurt President Trump.” The watchdog said Wolf and others denied that. Its report also included a 7 July email telling the acting USIA to “hold on sending this one out until you have a chance to speak to” Wolf. The watchdog said Wolf told it he wanted the delay because the report was poorly written. According to the watchdog, dissemination of the report was delayed again in August.",News/US news,Trump official interfered in report on Russian election meddling – watchdog,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/04/russian-2020-election-interference-trump-chad-wolf-dhs
5/5/2022,"My colleague, mentor and friend Tom Addiscott, who has died aged 79, was an agricultural research scientist who helped to determine the benefits and the environmental consequences of using fertiliser on the soil. Born in Brocket Hall, near Hatfield, Hertfordshire, which was then being used as a maternity hospital, to Dorothy (nee May), who died when Tom was eight, and Martin Addiscott, a second lieutenant in the second world war then manager of a fur factory, Tom was educated at Berkhamsted school before studying chemistry at Hertford College, Oxford, graduating in 1963. He then spent a year as a United Nations volunteer working on improving soil quality in Tanzania. He helped to develop methodology to assess what quantity of nutrients, such as phosphorus, potassium and calcium, would be available to a farmer’s crops, and which nutrients were economically worth testing for and how to do it. In 1966, Tom started work at Rothamsted, the agricultural research organisation, completing an MA the following year and a PhD in 1973, both at Oxford University. At Rothamsted, Tom developed some of the first computer models for the leaching of nitrate and later phosphate from soil, which can have damaging effects on the environment, including the creation of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas and green algal blooms in lakes. His work laid the foundations for much of the environmental computer modelling of the movement of water, nutrients and pollutants today. Tom had a strong social conscience and retained a lifelong interest in Africa. As a member of the Farm Africa charity, he visited Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia. For many years he led the local branch of the IPMS trade union at Rothamsted, and was endlessly considerate and encouraging to his colleagues, with a mischievous sense of humour. The Prince of Wales presented him with the gold medal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England in 1991. He was appointed a visiting professor at the University of East London in 1997 and awarded a DSc by Oxford University in 1999. Tom retired from Rothamsted in 2002, but continued publishing articles on a range of issues related to soil quality in agriculture, on nitrate and human health, and complexity theory in a soils context. He was also licensed as a reader in the Church of England and was actively involved in the parish of Harpenden. He would happily discuss science, politics and religion over a pint. He also loved music, especially Bach and jazz. In 1974 he developed a glioma, a type of brain tumour, requiring surgery and high-dose radiotherapy. Having almost died, he treated every moment from then on as a gift. The effects of the radiotherapy started 30 years later, leading to a slow deterioration in his mobility, speech and memory. He is survived by his wife, Sally (nee Nicholas), whom he married in 1970, their daughter, Catherine, two granddaughters, Erin and Lucy, and his brother, Tony, and sister, Susanne.",News/Environment,Thomas Addiscott obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/04/thomas-addiscott-obituary
5/5/2022,"The European parliament has refused to sign off the EU border agency’s accounts, saying it had failed to investigate alleged human rights violations of asylum seekers in Greece. The vote on the agency, Frontex, came after the resignation last week of its director, Fabrice Leggeri, who left after an investigation by Olaf, the EU’s anti-fraud body. The parliament’s decision was based on a report drafted largely before Leggeri resigned, and reflected continuing concern that Frontex was failing to protect asylum seekers’ human rights and uphold EU law. MEPs, meeting in Strasbourg, voted to postpone approving the Frontex accounts for 2020, during a session where they approved the budgets of dozens of other EU agencies that spend European taxpayers’ money. The Belgian Green MEP Saskia Bricmont, who sits on the European parliament’s civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee, tweeted: “The resignation of [Frontex] director last week does not address structural problems, nor the agency’s contribution to the Fortress Europe policy.” Frontex, the European border and coastguard agency, based in Warsaw, received a big increase in funds in response to the migration crisis of 2015-16, when 1.3 million people applied for asylum. Now one of the EU’s best-funded agencies, it had an annual budget of €364m (£307m) in 2020, up 10% on the previous year. There are plans to expand it further, to 10,000 border and coastguards by 2027. The delay in approving its accounts has no financial consequences for the agency, but is a form of political censure that empowers MEPs to issue recommendations to its new director. The European parliament delayed approval of Frontex’s accounts in 2021 and rebuked the agency for failing to respond to its previous recommendations. In a report giving the reasons for the latest delay, the European parliament’s budgetary control committee referred to problems in two EU member states. In Greece, Frontex “did not evaluate its activities”, despite official reports from national authorities, the Council of Europe and the UN that the agency was operating in areas where “fundamental rights violations” were taking place, it said. Frontex was also criticised for not suspending its operations in Hungary, despite a 2020 ruling by the European court of justice that Budapest was failing to implement EU law to protect asylum seekers. After the court judgment, another committee of MEPs called on Frontex to withdraw from Hungary. However, the agency continued working with the Budapest government on a case-by-case basis, including helping to return people denied asylum to their country of origin. MEPs also criticised the lopsided gender balance at Frontex, voicing “concern” that three-quarters of senior managers were men. It urged the agency to hold people accountable for 17 cases of harassment, although it did not provide details. MEPs also implicitly rebuked EU authorities for not giving them access to the findings of the EU anti-fraud agency, which opened an investigation in 2019 into alleged harassment, misconduct and illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers by Frontex. The Guardian understands that Olaf recommended disciplinary action against Leggeri and two other staff members; Olaf has declined to comment. Tomáš Zdechovský, a Czech centre-right MEP responsible for overseeing the Frontex accounts, said it was impossible to approve the accounts without knowing the results of the Olaf investigation. He was “looking forward to a more open dialogue” with the agency after Leggeri’s resignation, he said. The resolution criticising Frontex passed with 492 votes, with the centre-right, centre-left, liberals, green and radical left groups agreeing. Opposing the report were 145 MEPs from conservative nationalist parties and the far right.",News/World news,EU censures border agency after reports of human rights abuses in Greece,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/eu-censures-border-agency-after-reports-of-human-rights-abuses-in-greece
5/5/2022,"Sitting exams using pen and paper could soon be a thing of the past, as England’s qualifications regulator, Ofqual, said it is exploring technology to transform the way GCSEs and A-levels are administered. The regulator’s latest corporate plan says Ofqual will remove regulatory barriers to allow exam boards to study the use of remote assessment, digital delivery and “adaptive testing” software that tailors exam questions to student responses. Ian Bauckham, Ofqual’s chair, said: “The pandemic has, rightly, catalysed questions about not if but when and how greater use of technology and on-screen assessment should be adopted. “All proposed changes need to be carefully assessed for their impact on students, including those with special educational needs and disabilities.” School leaders said the use of exams delivered online could resolve security concerns and allow exams to go ahead in lockdown-style conditions in the future. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Our current reliance on a pen-and-paper exam system, organised at an industrial scale with Fort Knox-style security arrangements around the transportation and storing of papers, is hopelessly outdated and ripe for reform. “The recent experience of the pandemic has shown just how vulnerable it is to unexpected events. If online assessment had been available, it might not have been necessary to cancel all summer exams for two years in a row.” But Barton and Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, both said Ofqual should take the opportunity for a more radical look at the use of high-stakes exams within the English school system. “Education, and the proof of what a student has achieved in their time at school and college, is about far more than showing what can be remembered in an end-of-course exam,” Bousted said. Ofqual said adaptive testing could replace the use of tiered GCSE exams – where simpler “foundation tier” papers are offered to those candidates thought unable to attain high grades. Adaptive testing involves adjusting the difficulty of a test or exam to suit the aptitude of a student. When a student answers a question correctly they can be presented with progressively more demanding questions, and vice versa. “We would know how difficult the questions are, which means that students taking different combinations of questions can be compared and graded,” a spokesperson for Ofsted said. Adaptive testing is best suited to the use of multiple-choice questions or right/wrong answers in subjects such as maths. “While there are no immediate plans to launch adaptive testing, it’s important that we carry out this initial exploratory work both from a technical point of view but also making sure we fully take account of the views of students, teachers and leaders,” the spokesperson said.",News/Education,Pens down: England’s exams regulator exploring online A-levels and GCSEs,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/04/england-exams-regulator-ofqual-exploring-online-a-levels-gcses
5/5/2022,"England have slumped to their worst Test rating for more than a quarter of a century, dropping to No 6 in the ICC rankings after winning just one of their last 17 matches. Their current tally of 88 ranking points is their lowest since 1995 and leaves them sandwiched between Pakistan, who are now fifth on the list, and Sri Lanka. England remain second in both ODI and T20 rankings, led by New Zealand and India respectively, while Australia continue to top the Test charts. Ben Stokes, who recently replaced Joe Root as England’s Test captain, admitted on Tuesday that he was taking over a team at a low ebb. “What we can do is say there’s only one way to go from here, which is up,” he said. “We know we’ve not played to the standard we know we can. It’s about understanding that and then saying: ‘What can we do to fix it?’ I’m understanding that things don’t just happen overnight. I can’t expect it to just click and all of a sudden we’re No 1 in a year’s time.” Stokes has been named in the Durham squad to face Worcestershire in the County Championship on Thursday, which would be his first appearance of the English season. Elsewhere Ollie Robinson is due to play for Sussex against Middlesex after recovering from a tooth infection, and should be joined in the team by George Garton, who has not played since making his England debut in a T20 against West Indies in Barbados in January. Olly Stone’s long-awaited comeback from a stress fracture in his back – the third such injury of the 28-year-old’s career – lasted just seven balls for Warwickshire’s second XI on Tuesday, before he pulled up with a thigh strain. Stone has only made one competitive appearance since he sustained the injury 11 months ago, when he bowled five overs for Barnt Green in their victory against Kenilworth Wardens in the Birmingham Premier League Division One last month. Mark Wood did some light bowling in training at Durham on Tuesday and is hoping to return to international action with England’s white-ball team when they travel to the Netherlands next month. The Essex wicketkeeper, Adam Wheater, has announced that he will retire at the end of the season. “It’s been a tough call to make, but the timing feels right and I’m pleased to be going out on my own terms,” the 32-year-old said. “Not many players get the opportunity to play for their boyhood club, so to be able to do that has been a dream, and to be able to win the things we’ve won, I couldn’t have asked for more.”",Sport/Sport,England drop to No 6 in Test rankings with lowest points tally since 1995,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/04/england-drop-no-6-test-rankings-lowest-points-tally-since-1995-cricket
5/5/2022,"Name: Romcom queens. Arrival: Forthcoming. Appearance: Older, wiser, ready to reclaim the throne. Oh God, I thought we’d killed the romcom. We had – and for good reason. It had become old and stale, with every new film lazily hitting beats that had already been played better. A bit like where we are with superhero movies. Then what’s all the fuss about this romcom What Happens Later? Oh, Meg Ryan is going to star and direct. And? Look at her CV! When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, French Kiss, You’ve Got Mail, Joe Versus the Volcano … She even played a romcom lead in Innerspace, for crying out loud. The genre is in her blood. So why did she stop making them? Probably for fear of being typecast. But doesn’t the phrase “Meg Ryan romcom” make you happy? Doesn’t it feel like slipping into a comfortable pair of pyjamas? What’s the film about? Ryan and David Duchovny play ex-lovers who find themselves reunited after decades apart when they are stuck at a snowed-in airport. Sounds boring. Shut your dirty mouth. It sounds terrific. Just think, you will get to see all of Ryan’s trademark charm and hot-headed sparkiness, but tempered with a lifetime of love, loss and regret. It has the potential to be amazing. I suppose romcoms are wasted on the young. Exactly. Veteran actors have so much more life experience to bring to the parts. This may explain why others are returning to the genre. They are? Yes! Later this year, Julia Roberts will star in Ticket to Paradise, a romcom in which she will play George Clooney’s ex-wife. It’s her first romcom since Mother’s Day in 2016. Also, Sandra Bullock just released The Lost City, a kind of Romancing the Stone update in which she falls in love with Channing Tatum. It’s her first romcom since The Proposal in 2009. Anyone else? Jennifer Lopez just released Marry Me, but we don’t talk about that. We don’t? Have you seen it? No. Well, take it from someone who has: it’s best to pretend it never existed. Oh. But hey, isn’t all this great? All the original romcom queens are returning! They have grown up with their audiences and are ready to make something warm and familiar, but tinged with a newfound complexity. This could be the rebirth of the genre.
