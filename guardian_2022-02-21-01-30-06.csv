2/21/2022,"Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron have agreed to try to secure a ceasefire in the the east of Ukraine, and to put together an urgent summit at the highest level on the future of Ukraine, the Élysée Palace said in a statement. The two leaders spoke on the phone for 105 minutes, and the outcome, broadly confirmed by the Kremlin, suggests Russia might be willing to step back from the brink of a full invasion of Ukraine to allow renewed diplomatic discussions.  The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, will meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in the coming days to work on a possible summit at the highest level with Russia, Ukraine and allies. The Kremlin suggested the meeting would be held in the Normandy format, meaning the participants will be Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany. It is too early to say if Macron has pulled off a last-minute diplomatic coup, or if he has the full support for his initiative from Washington and London. So far, most of the French president’s diplomatic moves have been coordinated with the White House. The call came as the Belarus defence minister said Russia and Belarus were extending military drills that were due to end on Sunday, in a step that further intensifies pressure on Ukraine. The Kremlin said in the phone call Putin had expressed serious concern over the sharp deterioration of the situation on the line of contact in the Donbas. The statement added: “Taking into account the acuteness of the current state of affairs, the presidents considered it expedient to intensify the search for solutions through diplomatic means through the foreign ministries and political advisers to the leaders of the countries participating in the Normandy format. These contacts are designed to help restore the ceasefire and ensure progress in resolving the conflict around Donbas. The Kremlin insisted Putin was not withdrawing any of his wider demands, saying he “reiterated the need for the United States and Nato to take Russian demands for security guarantees seriously and respond to them concretely and to the point”. The statement added that Putin blamed the escalation in the Donbas on the provocations of the Ukrainian security forces, and that he complained of the continuing provision of modern weapons and ammunition to Ukraine by Nato countries, “which is pushing Kiev towards a military solution to the so-called Donbas problem”. Violence in eastern Ukraine has spiked in recent days as Ukraine and the two regions held by the rebels each accused the other of escalation. Russia said on Saturday at least two shells fired from a government-held part of eastern Ukraine landed across the border, but Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, dismissed that claim as “a fake statement.” For years, sporadic violence has broken out along the line separating Ukrainian forces from the Russia-backed rebels, but the recent increase in shelling and bombing could set off a full-scale war. The United States and many European countries have alleged for months that Russia, which has moved about 150,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, is trying to create pretexts to invade. Secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said US president Joe Biden is willing to meet Putin “at any time” to prevent a war in Ukraine. In a rapid-fire round of US talk shows, Blinken told CNN “everything we’re seeing suggests that this is dead serious, that we are on the brink of an invasion.” He added: “But until the tanks are actually rolling and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President Putin from carrying this forward,” He told CBS’s Face the Nation Biden has made it “very clear that he’s prepared to meet President Putin at any time, in any format, if that can help prevent a war”.",News/World news,Putin and Macron agree to try to secure ceasefire in eastern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/putin-and-macron-agree-to-try-and-secure-ceasefire-in-eastern-ukraine
2/21/2022,"Just 20 minutes walk from the ornate Hotel Bayerischer Hof, where world leaders gathered this weekend for the Munich security conference, lies No 12 Arcisstrasse, the shuttered brown ornamental building known as the Führerbau. On a cold grey Sunday morning, the building, now temporarily closed and in disrepair, has a forbidding air. Near the steps at the front is a small plaque with the bare inscription in German, Czech and Slovak: “In this building, on 29 September, 1938, the Munich agreement was signed, which led to the smashing of the Czechoslovak republic.”  No mention is made of the signatories, including Adolf Hitler and then British prime minister Neville Chamberlain, who, fearful of a renewed European war, appeased Hitler by agreeing to cede the Sudetenland. Hitler had promised this was his last territorial claim in Europe. The empty building, its interior preserved, stands as a monument to the ability of diplomats to misread their opponent. Back in the conference hall, this history hung heavy. No speech was complete without a reference to the threat of a return to war in the heart of Europe, or to an impending refugee crisis. No one was foolish enough to compare Russia to national socialism, but underlying every discussion was the question of Vladimir Putin’s true intentions and whether the western response is moral and a sufficient deterrent, or instead a betrayal and a repeat of the appeasement of the 30s. In his mercurial address to the conference hall on Saturday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not hold back in what he described as “his own horrible history lessons’’. Referencing the Russian-backed separatist shell that damaged a nursery school on Thursday, he said: “Seeing a shell crater in the schoolyard, children have a question: has the world forgotten its mistakes of the 20th century?   Russia  Army: 280,000, including 2,840 tanks and 6,920 fighting vehicles; 150 Iskander ballistic missiles; 4,684+ artillery; 1,520 surface-to-air batteries.  Navy (just the Black Sea fleet): 6 submarines; 6 warships; 35 patrol ships.  Air force: 1,160 combat planes, 394 attack helicopters, 714 air defence systems. Ukraine Army: 145,000, including 858 tanks and 1,184 fighting vehicles; 90 Tochka ballistic missiles; 1,818 artillery; 75+ surface-to-air batteries.  Navy: 1 warship, 12 patrol and coastal ships.  Air force: 125 combat planes, 35 attack helicopters; 6 medium TB2 drones; 322 air defence systems.  Source: International Institute of Strategic Studies “What do appeasement attempts lead to? How did the question ‘Why die for Danzig ?’ [a French anti-war slogan coined in 1939] turn into the need to die for Dunkirk and dozens of other cities in Europe and the world, at the cost of tens of millions of lives?” He then twisted the knife by saying there was no threat of war in Europe – the war was already under way: “How did it happen that there is a war ongoing and people are dying in Europe in the 21st century? Why does it last longer than World War II? How did we get to the biggest security crisis since the cold war?” Zelenskiy had answers that the doting western security establishment might not have applauded so vociferously if they listened harder to his withering attack on their collective failure. He blamed “selfishness, self-confidence, irresponsibility of countries at the global level. As a result, some commit crimes, and others stay indifferent. Indifference that results in complicity. This is your contribution to the security of Europe and the world.” He said: “Ukraine has been Europe’s shield for eight years. For eight years, it has been holding back one of the largest armies in the world.” Yet the door to the EU and Nato had not been opened. The promises to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty enshrined in the Budapest memorandum in 1994 seemed worthless. “The current policy of appeasement,” he said, “has to be turned into one of guarantees of security and peace”. He called for the west to send more arms and to impose preventive sanctions nimmediately. He revealed he had challenged western leaders who said they were 100% sure that an invasion would occur. “What are you waiting for? We don’t need your sanctions after the bombardment will happen and after our country will be fired on, or after we have no borders, or economy.” On Sunday morning, the former president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, gently picked up Zelenskiy’s challenge, asking Charles Michel, the European Council president, if at the very least the EU should be more proactive. “Are you ready personally to give Ukraine an emergency invitation to fast-forward discussions on accession to the EU? It would give the EU a unique chance at this difficult time to gain some advantage. Right now the EU is very united, but very reactive.” Kaljulaid did not get an answer in the affirmative. Although Michel claimed Putin’s strategy was backfiring by creating unprecedented transatlantic unity – the common dominant public theme at the conference – the source of his circumspection about enlargement partly lay in history. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, reflecting a longstanding scepticism in parts of Germany about Nato enlargement to the east, pointedly told the Munich conference that Ukraine’s membership is not on the foreseeable agenda, and he had told Putin as much. Although Scholz insisted he would not be naive in his diplomacy, and defended the principle of national self-determination, he clearly hopes his statement takes Ukraine closer to effective future neutrality, and that this might assuage Putin. It did not please Zelenskiy, who witheringly dismissed the idea as Munich 2.0. But Putin wants the pledge in writing, and again history plays a role in his thinking. Russian mythology holds that Russia in 1990-91, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, was promised no Nato enlargement to the east. The more subtle truth, meticulously charted by the historian ME Sarotte in her book Not One Inch, judges no such offer was made by George Bush, even if it was discussed by advisers. But Putin has his casus belli, and it may be there will be no compromise, no pledge in writing, no piece of paper, that will lead to peace in our time.",News/World news,Memory of 1938 hangs heavy in Munich as Ukrainian president calls for action,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/memory-of-1938-munich-ukrainian-president-zelenskiy-russia
2/21/2022,"The police watchdog has ordered a force to re-examine its handling of the case of a black student killed on a railway line after his parents complained their son’s death was not properly investigated because of his race. Romello McCook, a talented and popular 22-year-old, was hit by a train after a night out in Plymouth, where he was about to begin a course in architectural engineering.  British Transport Police (BTP) immediately concluded it was an accident but his parents, Lawrence and Vivienne McCook, believe their son may have been the victim of a crime and have discovered a string of flaws in the inquiry. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has investigated how BTP dealt with the family’s complaint that the case was not taken seriously because of the student’s race and – in a decision seen by the Guardian – concluded the force should look again at how it has handled their grievance. McCook’s parents, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, welcomed the decision and said they hoped it would lead to a full re-investigation. They are also hoping to learn more of what happened to their son when an inquest takes place in June. Lawrence McCook said: “We felt we have been let down because of our ethnicity. That is very sad. Romello was our only child. We brought him to this country from Jamaica hoping life would be good. He did very well. He was very popular and very happy. But the police did not do very basic things when they investigated.” Vivienne McCook added: “We felt the moment they went down there and saw it was a black person the investigation ended. The case was almost closed from that day. We were hoping the police would help us and they didn’t. We’ve had to become investigators.” McCook was starting a new course in Plymouth in the autumn of 2018 having already spent three years studying in the Devon city. On the night of 29-30 September he went to a club and left in the early hours. His bank card was used in a shop at 6.05am and shortly after 10am he was hit by a train. BTP put it down as an accident, but McCook’s parents could not understand why he was more than two miles from his accommodation and walking in the opposite direction. They were mystified that he did not have his phone with him, though he was “addicted” to it and could not understand how he had got on to the line as there was a high fence. He had been drinking but his family did not believe he was so drunk that he had lost control. Dissatisfied with the police inquiry, they carried out their own investigation and established his phone appeared to have been used after his death, suggesting to them that it may have been stolen. Another police force reviewed the BTP investigation and concluded there were “missed opportunities” to trace McCook’s movements, including securing CCTV footage before it was wiped. The report, seen by the Guardian, said: “What caused Romello to be at this spot, some miles from his address and walking in the opposite direction appears never to have been considered by the initial investigation … the concerns of the McCooks were not heard and evidence that could have potentially answered some of the questions regarding where Romello had been and who he was with were lost.” The IOPC has written to the McCooks acknowledging that “errors” made at the start of the investigation led to them “losing a significant amount of faith in the police process”. It said that none of the reviews had asked the McCook family why they felt ethnicity played a part in how the investigation was carried out and said their concerns about this should be looked at properly. BTP acknowledges that questions remained unanswered but said there was “no evidence or information to indicate any suspicion or third party involvement”. A spokesperson said:“We strongly refute the suggestion that his death wasn’t investigated properly because of the colour of his skin.”",News/UK news,Police force told to re-examine handling of case of black student killed on railway line,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/20/police-force-told-to-re-examine-handling-of-case-of-black-student-killed-on-railway-line
2/21/2022,"London fashion week has paid a glamorous tribute to designer Federica Cavenati, known as Kikka, who died in November at the age of 28 after a short and sudden illness. The last collection Cavenati worked on was completed after her death by Marco Capaldo, her partner both in life and their independent fashion label 16Arlington, and presented on the catwalk at an emotional Sunday morning show in Bloomsbury.  “This was a celebration of the most beautiful person in my life,” Capaldo said backstage after the show. “I just hope that I did her proud.” The mood was sombre but the clothes were anything but. Cavenati’s name was synonymous with effervescent partywear – maribou feathers, platform disco boots and barely-there dancefloor dresses – and that spirit lived on in snakeskin-printed leather minidresses, cut-out sequin jumpsuits and tissue-thin knit dresses. Many of the feathers used in the collection were from an archive hand-dyed by Cavenati some years ago. The collection was called Tears, referenced further by teardrops embroidered in crystal beading on white silk shirts. But there was a playfulness in the wet-look feather boas and acid-tipped fluffy bucket hats, which Capaldo said felt true to the “lavishly, fabulously generous” Cavenati who “was a luminous person”. The designer Alice Temperley made radical changes during the pandemic to future-proof her label, moving her headquarters from London to Somerset, shifting to local production where possible, diversifying into homeware and planning an expansion of Somerset, a less expensive ‘younger sister’ line. Temperley brought the first collection designed in her Ilminster studio to a showroom in the capital for London fashion week, but its heart remained in the countryside. “I call this my wild west collection, because it’s my love of Somerset with a bit of cowgirl escapism added in,” said the designer, surrounded by jodhpur-style jeans, ponchos, romantic full skirts and bohemian ruffled prairie dresses. A silver-studded leather jacket, inspired by a vintage belt in Temperley’s own wardrobe, nodded to James Dean, while the rhinestone-dotted collared cocktail dresses referenced Dolly Parton. Velvet trouser suits, which are a signature of the brand – “we can’t make them fast enough!” – are made for autumn in carnation pink and ice blue, with or without fitted waistcoats. A shawl-collar trouser suit in striped British merino wool, made in Somerset, is the first tailoring look from the brand to be fully manufactured in the UK.",Lifestyle/Fashion,London fashion week celebrates Federica Cavenati’s last collection,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/20/london-fashion-week-celebrates-federica-cavenati-last-collection
