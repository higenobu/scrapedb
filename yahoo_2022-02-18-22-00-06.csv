2/18/2022,"A NY judge ruled Thursday that Trump must sit for a deposition in NY AG Letitia James' investigation. During court proceedings, Trump lawyers got so angry that the judge called time-outs, the NYT reported. James is investigating whether the Trump Org. broke state laws in its business dealings. Lawyers representing former President Donald Trump in his battle with the New York attorney general's office got so tense in court proceedings on Thursday that the judge had to call several time-outs, The New York Times reported. New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron ruled on Thursday that Trump and two of his children had to sit for depositions in Attorney General Letitia James' civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization broke state laws in its business dealings. James has long tried to compel Trump to submit to questioning as part of her investigation, and Trump has fought those efforts in court. Engoron said Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump should be questioned within 21 days, saying James ""uncovers copious evidence of possible financial fraud, and wants to question, under oath, several of the entities' principals, including its namesake. She has the clear right to do so."" During the virtual hearing that preceded the order, Trump's lawyers grew extremely irked while trying to fight James' request, The Times reported. They grew so heated that Engoron and his clerk had to call for time-outs multiple times, The Times reported, writing that they were on several occasions ""raising their hands in the shape of a T."" As Insider's Laura Italiano, Sonam Sheth, and Jacob Shamsian reported, Trump lawyers also attacked James personally during the Thursday hearing, with the attorney Alina Habba accusing James, a Democrat, of ""prosecutorial misconduct."" ""The only reason she is doing this is because he is a former president, and on the other side of the fence,"" Habba said. Ron Fischetti, another Trump attorney, told Insider they would appeal the ruling. In a statement, James said: ""No one will be permitted to stand in the way of the pursuit of justice, no matter how powerful they are. No one is above the law."" In a statement issued the same day, Trump said James' office was ""doing everything within their corrupt discretion to interfere with my business relationships, and with the political process."" ""It is a continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in history â€” and remember, I can't get a fair hearing in New York because of the hatred of me by Judges and the judiciary. It is not possible!""

2/18/2022,"By Phil Stewart WARSAW (Reuters) -U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced on Friday the planned sale of 250 Abrams tanks to Poland, as Washington moves to strengthen the defences of a key eastern European ally amid a mounting threat of war between neighboring Ukraine and Russia. Austin was speaking during a trip to Warsaw, where Polish leaders have been alarmed by the deployment of thousands of Russian forces in neighbouring Belarus, part of a huge Russian buildup around Ukraine that NATO says positions Moscow for an invasion. President Vladimir Putin denies any plan to invade. ""Some of those forces (are) within 200 miles (321 km) of the Polish border,"" Austin said. ""If Russia further invades Ukraine, Poland could see tens of thousands of displaced Ukrainians and others flowing across its border, trying to save themselves and their families from the scourge of war."" The sale of Abrams tanks to Poland, which is also home to a future U.S. missile defense site, is another sign of a deep and growing defence relationship with the United States. It follows the deployment of nearly 5,000 additional U.S. troops to Poland as well as additional fighter aircraft, as part of Washington's response to the Ukraine crisis. 'A STRONGER NATO' The Abrams battle tank carries a crew of four personnel and has a manually loaded cannon that can fire against enemy personnel armored vehicles and even low-flying aircraft, according to its manufacturer, General Dynamics. ""What Mr. Putin did not want was a stronger NATO on his flank, and that's exactly what he has today,"" Austin told a news conference. ""It will also strengthen our interoperability with the Polish armed forces, boosting the credibility of our combined deterrence efforts and those of our other NATO Allies."" Kyiv and the rebels have blamed each other for escalating tensions after artillery and mortar attacks this week, prompting fears that Russia, which has massed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, could get involved. For a second day, Austin dismissed Russian claims that it was withdrawing troops from the areas around Ukraine. Poland is among the NATO members that are most hawkish in confronting what it sees as Russia's revisionist ambitions in Eastern Europe. Birthplace of the Solidarity trade union movement that played a key role in bringing down Communism in central Europe, Poland is particularly sensitive to what it sees as threats of Russian expansionism, and both conservative and liberal governments have been steadfast in their support for Kyiv. ""Poland knows first-hand the steep cost paid by victims of aggression from larger neighbors, and it has made valuable contributions to assist Ukraine in building up its defense capabilities,"" Austin said, noting training exercises and its offer of ammunition and portable air defense weapons to Ukraine. Washington is also finalising its deployment of an additional 4,700 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division, more than doubling the U.S. troop presence in Poland. President Joe Biden has ruled out deploying U.S. forces to fight in Ukraine against Russia. But deployments like the ones to Poland could put U.S. and Russian troops in close proximity, which experts say is still a risk given that conflict can easily, and inadvertently, spill over borders. The U.S. military has dispatched F-15 fighter jets to Lask Air Base, Poland, offering additional capability for air policing, officials say. Poland's southeastern border is close to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where the United States relocated its embassy due to the mounting fears of a Russian invasion. U.S. officials have said U.S. troops in Poland could help American citizens who may flee to the country if Russia invades as well as assist Warsaw with a possible influx of refugees. U.S. officials believe millions of Ukrainians may become refugees and internally displaced in a full-scale conflict. Poland is already home to between one and two million Ukrainians.

2/18/2022,"Wall Street suggests tuning out of Roku (ROKU) after the streaming giant turned in a severe profit warning for 2022 as it invests back into its business. Shares of the company crashed 25% to $107 in pre-market trading Friday as the Street smashed down the reset button on Roku's valuation. ""We don't expect investors to hang on for the ride though. With a big cut to our EBITDA we take a much less optimistic view of Active Account value, so we slash our EV/Active Account-based valuation. We remain Equal Weight given the extent of the pull-back, but see Roku as dead money until proof points arise,"" Wells Fargo media analyst Steve Cahall said in a note. Roku saw slowing growth in the fourth quarter in areas such as active accounts and average revenue per user as people re-engaged with the real world again during the pandemic. The company's adjusted operating margins also dropped 750 basis points from a year ago amid supply chain disruptions weighing on the margins of Roku hardware. Here's how Roku performed in the fourth quarter versus Wall Street estimates: Net Sales: $865.3 million vs. $894 million Diluted EPS: $0.18 vs. $0.05 But Roku's outlook left much to be desired as the company goes into one of those Amazon-like investment cycles. For the full year, Roku sees adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) that is about in line with 2020 levels of $150 million. The Street was looking for roughly $535 million in adjusted operating profits. ""As we got through some of the worst uncertainty around the pandemic, we decided that we would continue or we kind of go back to our historical aggressive investment levels. And so, you're seeing strong investment in the back half of 2021 and into 2022,"" Roku CFO Steve Louden said on an earnings call. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.
