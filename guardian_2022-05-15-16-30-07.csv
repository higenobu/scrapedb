5/15/2022,"Over the years, many theories have popped up to attempt to explain why spending time in green space can reduce feelings of stress and anxiety, improve self-image and, in some studies, even measurably reduce the need for pain medication. From their purported ability to clean the air, to allegedly mood-lifting compounds emitted by soil bacteria, to some mysterious effect that simply seeing the colour green has on our brains, let’s look at how the evidence stacks up. Probably the most common claim I see is that plants, particularly houseplants, clean the air. While they do indeed do this on a planetary scale, the latest research now suggests that in indoor spaces the sheer volume you would need to achieve this makes it implausible. Quite how many? Well, several hundred per square metre of living space to achieve the same benefit of simply opening a window. Even I can’t cope with that. Another one of the most enduring memes on social media is that soil bacteria, inhaled into our bloodstream, has been proven to improve our mood. Intrigued, I went to track down the scientific paper. This was a single study where the bacteria were injected directly into the brains of live lab mice. Unless you’re a caged mouse, this experiment doesn’t really confirm very much and even then the method of administration doesn’t sound like much fun. What we do know, however, is there is something unusual about the colour green that seems to affect how our brains function. Researchers investigating the effect of exercise on mental health have found that seeing views of the natural world projected on to screens had additional benefits over and above the workout alone. However, when they manipulated the colour of these screens to show the same views in black and white or in shades of red, the effect was markedly reduced compared to the original green. This may mean that using evergreen species or, potentially, even something as simple as painting your fence green might contribute to its effect. Similarly, designing your garden to be higher maintenance so that it is not simply somewhere to sunbathe in summer may improve the beneficial effect by encouraging gentle workouts. We know that low-impact, prolonged exercise, such as gardening, can burn more calories than a hard-hitting gym session, despite feeling easier. It is a way of being active that may appeal to far more people – if for no other reason than it’s being outside in the fresh air and isn’t as brain-numbingly boring as looking at the flashing lights of the treadmill, which brings me to my final point… Gardening is also a classic form of practising mindfulness, which can help to focus our thoughts on the here and now, distracting us from any worries or stresses. It’s not my thing, but mindfulness exercises are well documented to have a positive impact on mental health, and are even recommended by the NHS. So ditch dull, low-maintenance schemes such as herbaceous plants for a more absorbing design with a backbone of evergreens, and you could turn your garden into a welcoming, therapeutic space.

5/15/2022,"Shot after shot pounded into the Russian missile battery hidden by the lighthouse on Snake Island, a Black Sea rock 22 miles (35km) from the Ukrainian coast. The edited video, released by the Ukrainian military, showed the strike and its aftermath – all taken from a Turkish-designed Bayraktar TB2 drone. Until then, evidence of the TB2 – a remotely piloted killer drone with a range of up to 190 miles – had largely disappeared from the conflict. The assumption was that the two dozen or so that Ukraine had bought from Turkey had been shot down and Ankara, not wanting to upset Russia, had declined to supply more. Yet the battle for control of Snake Island suggested the picture had changed. A day later, another TB2 video, accompanied by the pumping music typical of these propaganda releases, showed a landing craft being destroyed; a day after that, the downing of an Mi-8 helicopter as Russian troops were disembarking. Death from a distance, shown on social media video. An aviation analyst, Amelia Smith, spotted that one of the drone videos indicated the drone had a new registration: T253 – not seen in Ukraine before. It had been spotted being tested in late March around the manufacturer’s test facility in Turkey, suggesting it was newly supplied, perhaps part of a new batch. One week on, Russia said it had shot down nine TB2 drones, which cost somewhere between $1m (£820,000) to $2m each, plus several other uncrewed aircraft, in the battle for Snake Island. While that claim is hard to verify, control of the territory is still being contested, for all the videoed strikes. The TB2s are clearly militarily effective – and are used for all their propaganda worth. But it is not obvious they are militarily decisive. The point is not lost on Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who said in April: “With all due respect to Bayraktar, and to any hardware, I will tell you, frankly, this is a different war.” The 11-week conflict – in which Russia’s invasion has stalled after capturing most of the south coast and some of the east of the country – has become, since the abortive attempt to take Kyiv, largely a battle of tanks and artillery in which both sides exchange heavy and often unguided fire as they fight over increasingly small amounts of territory. This is not to suggest that drones are irrelevant. However, it reflects in part the reality that for both sides, the larger armed drones – the TB2s on the Ukrainian side and Russia’s nearest equivalent, the Orion drone - have not been present in large numbers and once eliminated are not easy to replace. Sam Bendett, a drone expert with the US Center for Naval Analyses thinktank, said the Ukrainian military had taken advantage of the fact that Russia did not control all the airspace and that it did not have persistent electronic warfare defences “with some very accurate and significant strikes”. But he added: “What is needed from their perspective is to do so on a much larger scale.” Russia knew it needed to counter the TB2 from the 2020 war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, in which Azerbaijan used Turkish drones to knock out Armenia’s Russian-designed tanks and gain a decisive advantage. Moscow had long lagged behind in drone technology, said Douglas Barrie, an aerospace analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Russia is having to play catchup. They have underinvested in this area since the early 1990s, just as they underinvested across the board,” he said. Moscow started deploying Orion combat drones in Ukraine in March, followed almost immediately by reports one had been shot down. “They went into the war with a limited supply, the consequence of decisions made years ago; perhaps with two or three dozen Orions, instead of having a larger number,” Bendett said. Ukraine has wasted little opportunity in trying to demonstrate the homespun nature of Russian drones: videos of a downed Orlan 10 reconnaissance drone being taken apart show it relies on a consumer Canon DSLR camera with key buttons glued into position and, for its fuel tank, parts of a water bottle, including the screw-on top. “No original part” was made in Russia, the Ukrainians conclude in the video, and the true cost of the drone was estimated at $3,000 rather than the $80,000 to $120,000 official cost. It is probably a reasonable estimate, but in reality, even Turkish TB2 drones have relied on off-the-shelf components to keep costs down and the pace of manufacturing up. Meanwhile, as the war becomes increasingly attritional, and armed drones are knocked out of the sky, new drones are coming to the fore. The US has agreed to supply to Ukraine at least 700 of the less sophisticated single-use, or kamikaze, Switchblade 300 and 600 drones, with a range of six or 25 miles, loitering munitions that can hang in the sky and smash down, with fearful effect on their target. Switchblades have started to arrive on the frontline – a Ukrainian video from a week ago purports to show a Russian position struck from above, followed by soldiers fleeing in terror. But again, although the number of kamikaze drones appears large, the stockpile may be quickly depleted as the war continues. Prof Peter Lee, a drones expert at Portsmouth University, said that in a war where “no side has control of the air” the most significant use of drones has instead been for “intelligence gathering and situational awareness – exactly what aircraft were first used for 100 years ago”. Each side has made heavy use of simple, commercially available drones for reconnaissance, with videos frequently released into the public domain, such as an edited montage of footage of a Russian armoured column being ambushed in Brovary, east of Kyiv, in March. Drone footage of artillery shelling, attacks on armoured vehicles and other fighting on both sides have become a routine feature of the war. Such has been the demand for simple camera drones that China’s DJI, the world’s largest manufacturer, chose in April to suspend sales of its easy-to-use drones to Ukraine and, more surprisingly, to Russia – although it is unclear if the ban will have a meaningful effect. One expert has estimated that Ukraine is operating as many as 6,000 reconnaissance drones on the battlefield. “Drones are not a war-winning technology,” Lee said. “But they are a war-enabling technology, and what we have seen is Ukraine responding in a quicker and more agile way.”",News/World news,"‘War-enabling, not war-winning’: how are drones affecting the Ukraine war?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/war-enabling-not-war-winning-how-are-drones-affecting-the-ukraine-war
5/15/2022,"One of Britain’s most prominent retailers has called for a major welfare boost for the poorest as pressure grows on chancellor Rishi Sunak to act on the cost of living crisis. Stuart Rose, the chairman of Asda and Conservative peer, effectively backed reinstating a £20-a-week uplift in universal credit introduced at the start of the Covid pandemic to help those on low incomes. He said some were seeing “shocking” increases in their bills and warned that the pressures were likely to persist into 2024. “We’ve got a national economic emergency and we’ve all got to pull together and sort it out,” he told the Observer. “Doing nothing is not an option. We’ve got to act and act fast. Even if things do improve next year, prices will still be going up as inflation falls. The people we need to worry about are those on lower incomes. They are really struggling.” Rose is the latest senior business figure and Conservative to urge immediate action. Last week, Tesco chairman John Allan called for support, saying there was now an “overwhelming case” for a windfall tax on energy companies to help those suffering the most from the cost of living crisis. Rose said that he was “nervous about a windfall tax” and believed that direct, targeted help to the low paid was a better approach. “I think it needs to be done through welfare – it needs to be carefully targeted,” he said. “It needs to be an intervention which is going to make a significant difference to people. I don’t know how people on lower wages and a couple of kids are going to manage this year. If you’ve got an illness, you provide medicine until you’re cured then take it away. You just have to explain it carefully. People will understand. I would be having a very, very targeted intervention that makes a meaningful difference to people – the equivalent of £1,000 a year. “It is shocking. This has been coming down the road for months, if not longer. It is shocking that we’ve only just seemed to have seen this coming. “The second thing to say is this is not going to be temporary. This is going to have a continuing effect on the economy and therefore on consumers through to 2024. That’s a big problem.” His intervention comes after Sunak said that an old computer system used by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) prevented him from raising benefits more in the spring statement. He admitted that citing technical problems “sounds like an excuse”, but had been told there could only be an uplift once a year for people on some benefits. Several Tories have been pushing for action. Boris Johnson has refused to rule out the introduction of a windfall tax, while Sunak has suggested that it could be an option if energy companies fail to invest in the UK. However, many MPs want tax cuts to be brought forward or help through the benefits system. The government increased benefits by 3% when inflation is running at 7% and is forecast to hit 10% by the end of the year. Rose, a figurehead in the Remain campaign ahead of the EU referendum, lamented the fact that he felt “you’re not allowed” to cite Brexit’s impact on the cost of living crisis. “It’s the biggest single economic disaster that has happened to this country, and will have a continuing negative effect for some time to come. “It’s been conveniently camouflaged and ignored because of Covid. It was the best excuse the government ever had to cover up all the bad effects of Brexit. The costs of carriage, insurance, freight, administration and labour have gone up. It has created the issue we’ve got with Northern Ireland. Trade with Europe has gone down by a greater amount than any new trade that we got from foreign forays, where people were rushing around the world saying: ‘We’ve got another trade deal.’ We can’t reverse it, but my goodness, at some point in time somebody needs to be honest and have a proper balance-sheet reckoning. No one wants to be seen as a ‘Remoaner’, but it’s actually shocking. If it wasn’t so shocking, it would be comical.” He said that he believed a politician would emerge in the next generation willing to champion a closer relationship with Europe again: “There is a young man or woman, probably already around, who will be standing on an orange box in 10 or 15 years’ time, saying: ‘I have this vision.’ I reckon we’ll be back in Europe – with some sort of different structure, but closer to the Europeans in some sort of trading way – by the middle of the 2030s. That’s my prediction.”",News/Business,Tory peer calls for welfare boost to counter cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/15/tory-peer-stuart-rose-calls-for-welfare-boost-to-counter-cost-of-living-crisis
5/15/2022,"It is a bright, chilly morning on the Redgrave Pinsent rowing lake near Caversham as, one stroke at a time, the UK’s elite rowers start to put some clear water between themselves and their disappointing performance at the Tokyo Olympics. For the first time since Moscow in 1980, an era so remote that East Germany topped the medals table on the lake, Team GB’s rowers returned home without winning one of the 14 golds on offer. Nearly £25m of mostly lottery-based funding sent 41 rowers to Japan, more than any other nation in the competition, and a silver and a bronze were all they had to show for it. The bronze came in the men’s eight, on 30 July 2021, the final event of the regatta. It was the same day Beth Shriever, who was forced to raise £50,000 via crowdfunding to qualify for Tokyo after UK Sport initially decided not to support her, won gold in the BMX. It was also the day Josh Bugajski, one of the eight, launched a stinging attack on the legendary former coach Jürgen Gröbler, who left the programme abruptly in August 2020, describing him as someone who “destroys the souls” of some of his athletes. It is against this backdrop of disappointment and recrimination, and a budget cut to about £22m, that British Rowing has set out on the short three-year cycle that leads to Paris in 2024. It needs to identify what went wrong in Tokyo and find solutions. And also what went right, as a foundation for rebuilding. There are new names and a fresh approach in many of the senior coaching roles, while the rolling process of team-building has brought some promising young rowers into the programme to replace veterans who have left. Between them, they will put in untold thousands of hours of work on the road from Caversham to Paris, which will go unnoticed and unacknowledged if results do not improve. Olympic gold is the only currency that matters in the great British public’s four-yearly cost-benefit analysis. In 1996, Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent won Great Britain’s only gold medal in Atlanta; only athletics and cycling have won Britain more medals in the history of the summer Games and Team GB was the top rowing nation at the Olympics of 2008, 2012 and 2016. But Redgrave’s ambitions as a coach were stymied when he failed to make the final rounds to become director of performance after Gröbler. Louise Kingsley, who was appointed director of performance in December, radiates enthusiasm for the job at hand. The first woman to hold the top coaching job in British rowing moved into the role after heading the Paralympic programme in Tokyo, which outperformed the Olympic squad in no uncertain terms by winning two of the four golds on offer. “It’s a bit science and stopwatch, and a bit of art,” she says. “One of the things we look for in our head coaches is the real, deep understanding of looking to see where the magic combinations are. We can see from our data and stats where we’ve got outstanding individuals but there are only two single-sculling slots on our Olympic team. Everything else is a crew boat. So it’s about how individuals blend together, work in harmony, physically, psychologically, technically, in order to find the magic.” ‘Erg’ scores, from individual performances on hi-tech rowing machines, play a part in the process, but no more than that. “When you watch crews going around, there are some crews that just click,” Kingsley says. “Many of our historic coxless fours, yes, we’ve had the powerhouses in there, the big guys with big lung capacities, big VO2 maxes, massive erg scores, but then the fourth person in the crews is the crew-maker, who harnesses them together in a way that brings out the best in everyone. So it’s not always about putting the four biggest erg scores in a boat and that being the fastest.” It is 18 months since Gröbler last supervised the training and crew-building at Caversham but the sense of his legacy is everywhere. Crews under his wing brought in 33 medals in eight Olympic Games. The national training complex – something that few Olympic sports can enjoy – is named after the pair who won gold in Barcelona in 1992, launching the former East Germany coach’s second golden age, with Team GB. Visitors arrive at the door along Gröbler’s Way. But even before Bugajski’s post-race criticism, Gröbler’s sudden departure after so many years of sustained success had raised questions about whether an uncompromising approach to training was appropriate for a modern Olympic programme. While some athletes undoubtedly thrived under his supervision, were others perhaps paying an unacceptable price for their success? The current team of coaches cannot escape or deny Gröbler’s influence, and nor would they want to. Equally, there is recognition the programme is moving with the times. “Jürgen’s legacy, his track record and his results are just unparalleled anywhere in the world,” Kingsley says. “But as with all things, there comes a natural end and a time to move on. Have we had an easy transition? No. Would Jürgen being here for the Tokyo Games have guaranteed that we would have been up the top of the medal table? No. If we look closely at the results we’ve had since Rio, we failed to perform throughout the whole cycle and Jürgen was here for a significant part of that. “Times are changing, the athletes that we are working with are changing and we have to adapt and evolve. That’s not to say that we can be soft, because we absolutely cannot be soft. “Rowing is a hard, tough sport, we have to do the training and the athletes are hungry to do the training, but that doesn’t mean we can’t do the training and push boundaries while looking after the individuals as people.” Paul Stannard, who was appointed head coach of the men’s Olympic team in January, was responsible for the team that took a first medal for Team GB in quadruple sculls with a silver in Tokyo. “I believe Jürgen got a lot of things right and the approach has to be similar,” he says. “I’m probably more reserved but the guys are hugely competitive and internal competition is crucial. We had a very young and inexperienced team [in Tokyo] and the amount of expectation and pressure on people was pretty high. Rightly so, but in some cases they let it get to them a bit. “Particularly with a three-year cycle, what we’re having to do is pretty intense and what I hope I can get across to the whole team is that there isn’t a lot of time.” Bugajski, who attracted fierce criticism from other members of the eight for his comments about Gröbler, remains part of the process and recently finished first in the pair with Matt Aldridge at the GB team trials. “Things have moved on so much since Tokyo,” he says. “Emotions were high and in hindsight, that probably wasn’t the right time to air my feelings. All these months later I do feel proud to have medalled in the men’s eight with my crewmates and now want to push on and try to improve that result in Paris. “There have been lots of positive changes at Caversham, with Louise as the new director of performance and Paul Stannard as our new men’s Olympic head coach. It feels like the start of an exciting new era for the GB rowing team and I’m in a much happier place and have been training well.” Stannard says: “In that moment, Josh said what he felt. You judge people on how they act and at the moment he’s doing a cracking job in a pair, trying for the team for next season. If he said something in the press, he said something in the press, and you’ve got to move forward with it. If I can help him be the best athlete he can possibly be, then I’ll do that.” There were some fine margins involved in coming up short in Japan, as Rowan McKellar, who just missed out on a medal in her first Olympics, can testify. The experience, she hopes, will come to be seen as part of the process of working towards success in Paris rather than two steps back from the rowers’ golden years. “It’s quite a big load on your shoulders, coming into what’s been the most successful team for however many Olympics,” she says. “And we lost so many people after Rio that it was a mountain to climb to get us back to the same point, but it wasn’t like we just crashed and burned at the Olympics. We had some really unfortunate performances and if we’d got all those fourth places to third, and some were milliseconds off, that would have changed the whole tone. It was disappointing, but it could be a really good stepping stone. “It was a really young team and we’ll have a lot more experience going into Paris from those of us who will stick around after Tokyo.” A chance to get the full Olympic experience next time around is another incentive during the three sessions a day, six days a week training regime that elite rowing demands. “I loved the experience and the Village was really cool,” McKellar says, “but everyone who’d been to Rio was saying: ‘Don’t take that as the full Olympic experience.’ In Paris, the whole thing will be even better.”",Sport/Sport,"‘Science, stopwatch, and a bit of art’: GB rowers’ mission to rekindle magic",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/15/science-stopwatch-and-a-bit-of-art-gb-rowers-mission-to-rekindle-magic
5/15/2022,"He is one of the biggest stars of stage and screen, from the Royal Shakespeare Company to Doctor Who, but even David Tennant suffers from nerves – and chocolate is one of his secrets to calming them, he has revealed. The actor allowed himself exactly three squares of chocolate in every interval of one of his shows, finding “comfort in the routine”. “Being on stage is a bit like jumping out of a plane. I try and nail down the things I can control,” he said. Stage fright has affected some of the foremost stars of the acting world, including Laurence Olivier, who suffered years of debilitating anguish. Tennant spoke of trying to control his anxieties and not “allow your brain to start winding you up”, which is when “you allow those little anxieties in”. He added: “When you’re opening a show, it’s just the sort of terror of ‘is this conceivable that I can remember a sequence of words in front of other humans?’ There’s just the horror of the terror that it just might not be actually possible. “And, as that recedes, a couple of weeks, a few weeks into the run, then your brain or my brain will almost try and replace one anxiety with a fabricated anxiety. I don’t know why it feels the need to do that, and I wish it didn’t.” Tennant opened up about his anxieties in the return of the RSC’s in-house podcast, Interval Drinks. The actor is an artistic associate of the RSC, with Hamlet and Richard II among his acclaimed performances. “You start rehearsing the speech you’re going to have to make to the audience about the fact that you can’t do this any longer and that you’re going to go to your dressing room and curl up into a primal ball and sort yourself to sleep,” he said. In the podcast, in conversation with Mark Quartley, who currently plays Henry VI in the RSC productions of Henry VI: Rebellion and Wars of the Roses, he also recalls struggling to speak his lines on stage on the press night of Romeo and Juliet at the Barbican, London, even though he had already performed it in Stratford. He said that, having experienced the “white hot heat of anxiety” with the earlier staging, he faced “a very dangerous area” with a second press night “where my brain would start playing those tricks on me”. He added: “I dried in the middle – I can’t remember what the actual line was even. I knew what the meaning was, but I had no idea what the words were.” He recalled that his co-star, Keith Dunphy, who was playing Tybalt, realised what had happened and “came roaring on stage, flailing his sword around, and we got on with it”.",Arts/Culture,David Tennant calms his stage fright … with chocolate ,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/15/david-tennant-calms-his-stage-fright-with-chocolate
5/15/2022,"Rangers take on Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League final on Wednesday, an extraordinary achievement for a club in administration 10 years ago. This chance of glory is particularly remarkable given Rangers have triumphed in Europe on one previous occasion. Fifty years ago this month, they lifted the European Cup Winners’ Cup in Barcelona after the most torrid, draining – and violent – football match I have attended. I fervently hope victory can be repeated but not, I pray, in similar circumstances. In 1972, Rangers had been suffering a trophy drought that had lasted years with our great rivals, Celtic, managed by Jock Stein, monopolising Scotland’s football silverware. As a young Rangers fan, I was to experience a great deal of disappointment. Europe offered a lifeline, however, and that season the team – managed by Willie Waddell – began a dramatic journey across the continent, albeit on an unorthodox route. Having dispatched Rennes in the first round, Rangers beat Sporting Lisbon 3-2 at Ibrox but lost by the same score in Portugal. In extra time each team scored another goal. Rangers should have progressed: away goals then counted double in the event of a tie, a rule that was bizarrely ignored by the Dutch referee Laurens van Ravens, who ordered a penalty shootout – which we lost. A purple-faced Waddell protested and Uefa officials backed down and awarded the tie to Rangers. Torino were beaten next, before Rangers took on Bayern Munich in the semi-final, drawing 1-1 in Germany before winning 2-0 at Ibrox against a squad that included Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Müller. Now it was our turn to party. On 24 May, I flew to Barcelona with my friend Jan de Vries. We eschewed the delights of the Sagrada and the Palace of Catalan Music and chose instead to experience the city’s cafe culture, swilling sangria in the mistaken belief it was mostly made of fruit juice and a dash of vermouth. In fact it was low on vitamin C and high on wine and brandy – which may explain a certain light-headedness we experienced as we headed to Camp Nou. Nor were we the only ones in that condition. On the other hand, we had no worries about rival fans. We were playing Dynamo Moscow in an era of Soviet travel bans. So Jan and I – along with the 20,000 Rangers fans who also made it to Camp Nou – had the stadium to ourselves. We posed for touchline photographs as the police looked on unconcerned. Rangers started the match at a pulsating pace. Colin Stein and then Willie Johnston scored. Then, minutes into the second half, goalkeeper Peter McCloy’s massive punt upfield evaded the Moscow defence and Johnston smashed the ball hard and low past Vladimir Pilguy in the Dynamo goal. Bedlam erupted. Jan picked me up and threw me into the air: a neat trick given that I am six foot tall, beefy and was also full of sangria. Three up – there was no way we could lose now. Dynamo began their fightback. Vladimir Eshtrekov scored; Dave Smith cleared the ball off our goalline; and with full time looming Aleksandr Mahovikov got a second. Our hold on the cup was hanging by a bootlace. Minutes later, the referee blew his whistle for a foul and thousands of fans invaded the pitch thinking the match was over. The pitch was cleared, the match restarted and eventually the final whistle was blown. Jubilant fans poured back on to the pitch, only to be assailed by rattled, baton-wielding police who had previously ignored our antics. Fans regrouped and fought back and as a full-scale battle unfolded Jan and I hurriedly left the stadium. By the time we reached Barcelona airport, check-in desks were surrounded by fans clutching bloody head wounds, purple bruises and torn clothes. Views about the religious persuasions of Spanish policemen were the main topic of conversation on the flight home. For the Rangers team there was no lap of honour and no showing off the cup at Camp Nou. The trophy was instead slipped to the captain, John Greig, in a backroom and he carried it home in his luggage. We got our first view of the trophy the following evening when Rangers, sporting the cup, toured Ibrox on the back of an old coal lorry that had been festooned with blue, red and white regalia. Rangers were given a two-year European ban – later reduced to one year – because of their fans’ behaviour. Was it deserved? Well, there was certainly some drunkenness but when we arrived the atmosphere in the city had been a happy carnival one. And there were no pitched battles with rival fans because there were none there to fight with. It was the sudden, panic-stricken actions of the police that was the main cause of the battle and that certainly did not justify a ban that meant Rangers could not defend the trophy they had played their hearts out to win. So yes, here is hoping for a similar result in Seville on Wednesday – but please let it be achieved in calmer conditions. Steering clear of the sangria might be a good start.",Sport/Football,Camp Nou glory: remembering Rangers’ 1972 European triumph | Robin McKie,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/15/camp-nou-glory-remembering-rangers-1972-european-triumph
5/15/2022,"It came free with a kid’s magazine, a small plastic pot containing a handful of blue mucus, into which one was advised to pour an accompanying sachet of small beads, to create “crunchy slime”. I chew the words over in my head during breakfast time as I eat a yoghurt. The day before, I had read a piece in the London Review of Books about the recent translation of a German book by Susanne Wedlich. It was called Slime: A Natural History. Jean-Paul Sartre’s “Being and Nothingness,” wrote Liam Shaw, “concludes with the idea of the visqueux. Sliminess is horrible to Sartre because it has neither the reassuring inertia of a solid nor the yielding shapelessness of a liquid, but a clinging contamination that envelops and consumes the investigator.” The visqueux, he continued, “is the ultimate ‘revenge’ of unconscious matter (‘being-in-itself’) against conscious matter (‘being-for-itself’).” And on the kitchen table beside my mug was something worse because this, this was “crunchy”. When I was a child, slime was something shocking on gameshows, shooting green out of robotic gunge tanks all over a loser’s nice clean tracksuit. Of course, nature had got there first, in that arrogant way it has, with slugs and phlegm and hagfish, which turns seawater into a suffocating slime “that will even gag a shark”. In folklore, slimy mould was depicted as the work of witches, sent to ruin dinner, and spiritualists swore ectoplasm was ghostly energy “exteriorised” by mediums. But by the turn of the 21st century, slime had evolved from something bad and disgusting to something deliciously fun and perfect for going-home bags. It’s possible to spend entire weeks watching manicured hands prod slime on YouTube, the videos often titled with words that suggest it as a kind of therapy. Toy shops devote whole aisles to the stuff: rainbowed, bloody, glittered, green. The crunchy one here on my table I have a problem with, and I’m trying to work out why. Is it because it threatens to break its borders, its hidden solids hinting at something evolving rather than rotting? Is it because I can too easily imagine it in my mouth? I do not like it. I do not like it being so close while I’m eating. Yet slime, as a state for now, a state for the state of us, seems important and suitably unsettling. In his review of Wedlich’s book, Shaw returns to Sartre, who thought “sliminess” denoted “a type of contaminated morality”. Doesn’t that make you sort of shiver? It feels like a slippery formless cruelty is rife right now. Sliminess continues to contaminate British politics, the sliminess of privilege – our prime minister is a man who broke the law and lied about it; a politician watched porn in parliament, and on and on, sticky and grim and oozing. It was slime I thought of, too, when I looked back at what Trump’s supreme court nominees said about abortion during confirmation hearings in order to get people to vote in their favour, where Brett Kavanaugh and the others said they accepted Roe v Wade as “precedent”, and “the law of the land”. The sliminess of rightwing America imposing its politics on international healthcare. The insidious gobbling creep of culture wars into bodies and relationships. Reading long into the night the correct fury of women spelling out the horrors that come with criminalising abortion, trapping people in poverty, it occurred to me that it would be useful for men to start noting the abortions that had allowed them to continue and thrive in their rich and exciting lives. To start acknowledging the ways abortion has helped shape our workplaces and schools and families for the better. It would be something distinct to hold on to, anyway. At various points in this house, my daughter has gathered various bicarbonates of sodas and attempted to make slime herself from things around the kitchen, ignoring my advice that she simply sneeze. She will make it, and prod it gingerly, and we’ll let it fall in its uncanny way between our fingers for a while. Some hours later I will find a sad pat of mucal material, perhaps studded with glitter, quivering loosely on the counter, and it will be my job to quietly dispose of it before it starts collecting cat hair. Throughout this childhood, a number of slimish shop-bought toys have sat alongside the squishy ones, defined by their fabric skins or external juicelessness. They include a sticky man, designed to be hurled violently at a wall, only to eerily descend, its gluey hands, its gummy feet crawling piece by piece behind the radiator where over the years it inevitably turns to a jellyish dust. Breakfast unfinished, as, having opened a thought door on viscosity my yoghurt was suddenly a step too far, I take the lid off the crunchy slime, an act of domestic warfare. I know that within 24 hours it will die, its power to shock, repel or delight dried out beside yesterdays mug. It isn’t much, I know, but it’s something.

5/15/2022,"Deborah James has been dying in public for five years. Since her diagnosis of terminal bowel cancer, she has become famous and beloved as a tireless campaigner, co-host of the award-winning podcast of You, Me and the Big C, author of a book about cancer and a humane and life-affirming contributor to the conversation around how we face death. Now she has said she is at the end of her life. She is no longer being kept alive in hospital, but has returned to her parents’ home to die with her husband, children and siblings around her. The phrase “end of life” has become a tag in familiar phrases: end-of-life care, end-of-life pathway, end-of-life wishes. The phrase “good death” is bandied about with no context. But at least we are starting as a society to talk about death. The brilliant, intimate, funny, flaying books and articles and programmes and podcasts by people who are dying have immense value, for they allow us to think of our own endings, and how we want to die says something about how we want to live. After surviving stage 4 breast cancer in 1975, Susan Sontag wrote sanely and brilliantly about her experience of illness (that “night-side of life”) and argued against the ideological cruelty of thinking about sickness in metaphorical terms – cancer, for instance, as a ruthless secret invasion, something to fight against and to overcome. She urged readers to treat illness instead only as literal, bodily, the luck of the draw. Yet Sontag was always terrified of dying. When in 2004 she was diagnosed with incurable myelodysplastic syndrome, the idea of her own death was unacceptable, unbearable, irreconcilable. She threw all her money and hope and refusal into radical experimental treatment that was never going to save her and made her last chapter one of suffering and, for people close to her, helpless dismay. She could not say goodbye to those who loved her because it was an unutterable acknowledgement that soon she would be their memory of her. She did not have a “good” end of life. When the film star Steve McQueen was diagnosed with aggressive terminal lung cancer, he took himself off to Mexico for alternative therapies and then a fatal operation. His surgeon apparently said that McQueen displayed an immense will to live, but it can be recast as an agonising refusal to acknowledge the truth that everyone else could see. He did not have a good death. James is only 40, with a young family. She has had all the treatments available (17 tumours removed, lungs deflated, body cut into) and has managed to live with spirit, humour and a heightened sense of life’s preciousness. But now she accepts that death is at the door. She wants, she said in an interview (where she was wearing a long green dress and gold earrings and sipping champagne), to be surrounded by those she loves the most and to hear the “normal buzz of my life as I go”. This sounds like a good death and here good has absolutely no moral connotations, nor should it ever have. We talk too often about the dying ones being brave, stoic, serene (or alternatively consumed by terror or denial). None of us knows how we will face death’s imperative, and courage or a performative cheer are not the point. I suppose I mean that James is living right up to the moment of dying; the approach of the end has not stopped her from living, but has made being alive even more resonant with meaning and love. This good death is partly in the hands of doctors and nurses. Unlike before the 20th century, people under medical care can often be rescued from illnesses that earlier would have killed them and when their time does come they no longer need to die in agony. (It is not uncommon for the drugs that remove the pain to end the life.) But such care can mean medicalisation, which can bring a battalion of death-defying procedures to the bedside: drugs and tubes and dissections and tailor-made poisons, a complex apparatus of bespoke tortures to keep the patient alive beyond their time. Death can come to seem like a shame and a failure; holding it off for as long as possible the goal. It can also be in the hands of the person who is at the end of their life. It is hard but not impossible to say no: no to the last-throw-of-the-dice treatment, to the faint chance of extra time that costs extra suffering, to the hope that is more like despair, to the illusion that death will not happen to us, or not yet, to the peculiarly human belief that illness is a weakness and dying a failure, scandal and disgrace. To say: the party’s over. As thinkers have told us for thousands of years, death gives meaning to existence (“The goal of all life is death,” wrote Freud). Animals perish but humans die, because humans know they are mortal, no matter that they might try hard not to know, even when they can hear the scaffolding being built under their window. The knowledge of dying can throw a person into the present tense, what Dennis Potter, near the end of his life and swigging morphine, called the wondrous “nowness of everything”, or Clive James in his valedictory poem celebrates as “a world that shone so brightly at the last”. Sontag wrote that for those who have neither religious faith nor a sense of death as “natural”, it is “the obscene mystery, the ultimate affront, the thing that cannot be controlled… only be denied”. It’s the word “natural” that pulls me up short here, the arrogance and self-alienation of feeling that humans are somehow outside of nature, outside of their own body, with its inevitable decay and its clock ticking out the days. When in her last weeks, Sontag talked about not-dying, she was talking about dying. And when James has over the years talked about dying, she has been talking about living: living illuminated by the knowledge of her ending. She has been a bright light, vulnerable, enchanting, poignant and embracing life. Perhaps, by publicly confronting her own mortality, she has enabled us better to take a timid peek at our own before death comes knocking and won’t take no for an answer.

5/15/2022,"Last week, Jamie Lee Curtis sparked “internet feud” headlines when she gleefully declared on social media that her new film “out marvels any Marvel movie”. The multiverse-themed Everything Everywhere All At Once has indeed been giving Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (which cost eight times as much) a run for its money, both financially and artistically. Punching way above its weight, this inventive indie pic boasts spectacular ambitions that belie its limited budget. Yet for all its madcap invention and frenzied visual wit, what drives this story of a woman trapped in a world of “laundry and taxes” is a tangible emotional wallop – that most “special” effect that franchise blockbusters so often fail to deliver. Michelle Yeoh sinks her teeth into a kaleidoscopic role that cheekily draws on her own genre-hopping back catalogue. She plays Evelyn Wang, a disillusioned and exhausted Chinese American woman who runs a laundromat with her smilingly disappointing husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan, who first rose to fame as Short Round in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). Together, they are trying to fend off IRS auditor Deirdre Beaubeirdra, played with a jobsworth sneer and a frightening fringe by Jamie Lee Curtis. Over the years, Evelyn (who swoons over musical romances on TV) has harboured dreams of being everything from a singer or a novelist to a therapist. But in real life she’s consumed with worries about her daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), and her visiting father, Gong Gong (James Hong), too scared to tell the latter that his granddaughter is gay, and too uptight to tell the former that she loves her anyway. Then, in a lift at the tax office, the usually placid Waymond is suddenly transformed into an action-man version of himself from another multiverse, on a Matrix-style mission to find “the one” who can save them from Jobu Tupaki, an all-powerful “verse jumper” who is threatening to tear reality apart. “Every rejection, every disappointment has led you to this moment,” he insists, revealing that an infinite number of alternative possibilities await our antiheroine, and declaring that although she is currently living “the worst you”, Evelyn is in fact “capable of anything… because you are so bad at everything”. Film-making duo Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (collectively known as “Daniels”) cut their teeth on music videos and internet shorts before making the extremely odd “farting corpse” movie Swiss Army Man. For Everything Everywhere All At Once they reportedly took inspiration from the Japanese artist Ikeda Manabu, whose work (“so intricate, so detailed, so dense”) can seem chaotic in closeup yet somehow clear from a distance. The same is true of this movie, which delights in sending its protagonist into a baffling array of increasingly absurd worlds (in one, people have hotdogs for fingers) while retaining recognisable overarching structures. For all its fantasy trappings, this is a film with down-to-earth concerns: mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, coming of age and coming out, dreams and disappointments, otherness and belonging, generation gaps and information overloads. Like the sci-fi stories of Kurt Vonnegut’s alter ego Kilgore Trout, or Douglas Adams’s increasingly influential Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, the narrative may be out of this world but the problems it addresses (a life of “fractured moments, contradictions and confusion” in which things only fleetingly make sense) are unmistakably human. Alongside 90s hits such as The Matrix and Fight Club, the Daniels litter their upstart movie with grand allusions to Stanley Kubrick’s 2001, Wong Kar-Wai’s In the Mood for Love and (most bizarrely) Pixar’s Ratatouille, all tumble-dried with elements of Jackie Chan martial arts epics, Mexican luchador movies and the DIY ethos of Michel Gondry. A rich and complex score by American experimental band Son Lux throws everything and the kitchen sink into the mix on a soundtrack that slips from head-spinning psychedelic noises to melancholy fragments of Debussy’s Clair de Lune. The result may be a tad overlong and convolutedly overstuffed, but it made me laugh, cry and think – which is more than can be said for many a Marvel flick.",Arts/Film,Everything Everywhere All at Once review – multiverse madness with meaning,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/15/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-review-michelle-yeoh-jamie-lee-curtis-daniel-kwan-daniel-scheinert
5/15/2022,"All wage-earners in Australia are required to build up a nest egg for their retirement with at least 10% of their income paid into superannuation savings. But as housing has become less and less affordable, some commentators have suggested that workers’ savings should be put towards a home first and super second. At the Liberal party campaign launch on Sunday, Scott Morrison announced that first home buyers would be allowed to access a “responsible amount” of super for housing under a re-elected Coalition government. But how would this scheme work? Only first-home buyers can access super for housing under the policy. They must have saved a 5% deposit for the home already without accessing super. It must be for an owner-occupier purchase and the first-home buyer must live in the home for at least 12 months. There is no floor on what your super balance must be before you can access it, and no cap on income, meaning even very low or very high-income earners can use it. It can be used in conjunction with the first-home buyer guarantee or first home super saver schemes. The scheme will start by 1 July 2023. Couples can both access the scheme, and one partner being ineligible does not prevent the other from accessing it. Buyers could withdraw up to 40% of their superannuation, to a maximum of $50,000. That means it would not be possible to clean out your account – at least 60% of your super balance would remain untouched. Allowing people to access up to $50,000 would mean a larger deposit, sooner, for first-home buyers. The Coalition estimates the scheme would cut the time taken to save a deposit by three years on average. The scheme is for both new and existing housing. When the property is sold, the invested amount would need to be returned to the superannuation fund, including a share of any capital gain. That means if a first-home buyer accessed the full $50,000 and lived in the house for 15 years and the price doubled, $100,000 would have to be returned to the worker’s super fund. The Coalition argues that this means the scheme doesn’t destroy retirement savings but supports them. Any capital gain associated with the first-home investment would be exempt from tax on repayment to their superannuation fund. But if the price of the house falls, the amount paid back also decreases proportionally. For example, if a $500,000 home with a $50,000 super payment is sold for $450,000, the amount returned to super would be $45,000. Labor’s Help to Buy scheme allows the government to contribute 30-40% of the cost of a home, equity that must be paid back when the property is sold or the buyer’s income reaches a certain threshold ($90,000 for singles; $120,000 for couples). The Labor scheme is capped, with only 10,000 people able to access the scheme each year. In his speech, Morrison compared the Coalition scheme to Labor’s, quipping: There is no limit on who can use it. You don’t have to sell it if you get a pay rise, or someone wants to go back to work full-time. There are no complex rules about income thresholds or who gets what. When you do an improvement, you don’t have to check with the government every time you go to Bunnings to buy a can of paint. The policies are also different in the event of death: under the Coalition scheme, nothing is repaid to the super fund; under Labor’s, the government investment is repaid by the estate. Industry Super has suggested that allowing people to access super could add up to 16%, or $134,000, to the cost of a home in the most expensive market, Sydney. In Melbourne, it is estimated price rises would be $55,000 and in Brisbane $35,000. However, this modelling was done in February 2021 – before the details of the Coalition scheme were announced. The government counters that there are an average of about 100,000 first-home buyers each year, and the combined value of their home purchases would be less than 1% of the total value of the housing market ($9.9tn). Yes. It has been proposed many times, most recently by the Master Builders Australia and through a long-running social media campaign by Liberal MP Tim Wilson. Similar schemes exist in New Zealand, Singapore and Canada. In previous iterations, even Coalition figures were scathing about the idea: “Increasing the amount of money going into real estate by facilitating access to super savings pre-retirement will not improve housing affordability. It would increase demand for housing and … would actually drive up house prices by more.” – then finance minister Mathias Cormann in 2014. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull reportedly called access to super for housing a “thoroughly bad” idea in Fairfax Media in 2016. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, had this to say in 2017: Young people need their super for retirement, not to try to take pressure off an urban housing bubble, better solved by decentralisation. On Sunday the shadow assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, said: Scott Morrison has just trashed any vestiges of economic credibility.Costello, Hockey, Turnbull …. all said super for housing was a dumb idea that would blow up the housing market.But Scott doesn’t give a dam. It’s all about the politics for this bloke. Labor’s housing spokesperson, Jason Clare, called the scheme “the last desperate act of a dying government”, arguing that it wouldn’t make housing more affordable and young people haven’t obtained enough super to access the policy. “This would be like adding kerosene to a fire ... their super will supercharge the property prices ... We’ve got to make it easier for Aussies to buy their own home.”",News/Australia news,How does the Coalition’s super scheme for first-home buyers work and would it drive up prices?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/15/how-does-the-coalitions-super-scheme-for-first-home-buyers-work-and-would-it-drive-up-prices
5/15/2022,"Last month, when the whole of Twitter was sharing that quartet of Emmanuel Macron photos, a female friend and I were voicing our appreciation of the chest hair aesthetic and cheerfully agreeing that we absolutely would, when a gentleman earnestly interrupted to remind us that it would be considered unacceptable these days for two men to discuss a female politician in such terms. I didn’t like to distress him with the suggestion that there may yet be dark corners of new and old media where men rate the shaggability of women in public life (ask Angela Rayner), but his reprimand spoke to a broader point: when it comes to objectification, we are currently enjoying a brief window of licence denied to men. It’s still sort of OK for women to make a joke out of commenting on the desirability or otherwise of men’s bodies, because the balance of power has been so grotesquely out of whack for so long that a few Boddingtons ads in the 1990s and Fleabag getting off to an Obama speech still barely tip the scales. In part, it’s OK precisely because it is framed as a joke; men rarely feel threatened by women commenting on their bodies, even if they don’t enjoy it. There’s also the unspoken law that men are not supposed to care what people say about their looks, much less show that their feelings have been hurt by a personal remark. But that might be about to change, after last week’s decision by an employment tribunal, which ruled that a male electrician in West Yorkshire who was called a “bald cunt” by his male boss was a victim of sexual harassment. Leaving aside the fact that “bald cunt” is unavoidably funny, especially when you picture it shouted by one man at another during an argument over a machine cover in the offices of the British Bung Company (which, incidentally, would be a great name for Sunak’s Treasury if he’s considering a rebrand), let’s consider what constitutes sexual harassment. The tribunal judges ruled that the incident was comparable to a previous case of a man remarking on the size of a woman’s breasts in the workplace; in both instances, they said, the insult was specific to the victim’s sex, therefore: sexual harassment. What they seem to have glossed over in this comparison is the intent of the person doing the insulting. Ask any woman what sexual harassment feels like and she’ll tell you it’s about intimidation. It’s the fear that a comment on your breasts will escalate to a hand; it’s the pointedly belittling reminder that some of your male superiors or co-workers will always see you foremost as tits and arse. Is a man mocking another man’s baldness really in the same league? I’m not persuaded. Of course, it should go without saying that men can and do experience sexual harassment at work and that it can be much harder for them to come forward. It’s also a positive step if men are willing to acknowledge publicly that they find insults about their appearance damaging; boys are conditioned so early to shrug this stuff off as banter. But let’s not blur the lines by suggesting that calling someone “bald”, however contemptuously, is the same as sexual intimidation. If everything is sexual harassment, then nothing is; that kind of levelling up is just a flattening that doesn’t serve anyone.
