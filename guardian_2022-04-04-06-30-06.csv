4/4/2022,"What happens when the BBC rids itself of all the woke lefties and liberal snowflakes who pollute the airwaves with their jokes and nonsense? It might look a little like Thatcher & Reagan: A Very Special Relationship (BBC Two), a respectful, if not particularly thrilling, two-part documentary that tells the story of the eight years during which the two leaders ruled their nations at the same time. It is written and presented by Charles Moore, former editor of the Daily Telegraph and the Spectator, who also wrote all three volumes of Margaret Thatcher’s authorised biography. This first episode covers Thatcher’s rise to power, Ronald Reagan’s inauguration and the Falklands war, with a bit of nuclear wrangling thrown-in for good measure. Moore argues that the pair had the vision and time in office to imagine an end to the cold war that had been simmering for more than 30 years, and which most world leaders saw as something to accept, rather than attempt to change. Reagan and Thatcher were dedicated cold war warriors, Moore suggests, who worked together to stand up to the Soviet Union, and in doing so changed the course of history. “They saw the beginning of the end of the cold war, as the world emerged from the shadow of nuclear Armageddon,” he says, to a television audience still facing a 24-hour news cycle comprised of east-west tensions and the shadow of nuclear Armageddon. Perhaps the documentary was made last summer. Thatcher’s steely public image as the “Iron Lady” actually came from a Soviet newspaper, according to Malcolm Rifkind, who first served under Thatcher as a junior minister in the Foreign Office and is one of many interviewees here. Although the programme’s waving away of the nuclear threat might seem horribly dated, this is not a terrible time to revise the history of the 1980s, particularly since Moore delves into US sanctions imposed on a Siberian gas pipeline and the divided response to this in Europe. But this is a film that is enamoured of its subjects. While last week’s Channel 4 documentary about the Falklands conflict used its insider access to find revelations about the conflict, this documentary does little but admire Reagan and Thatcher. It is almost entirely uncritical, save for Bernard Ingham, Thatcher’s chief press secretary, roughly admitting that the early years of her tenure were “dire”, and Moore explaining that just after she was first elected, there was a sense that she would only last a single term. Otherwise, almost every interviewee seems in awe of her fierceness and uncompromising nature. Reagan, too, gets off lightly, with the documentary claiming that there was a perception that he was “very much an actor”, lacking in brains at the start, before his communicative gifts began to dazzle. There are a few attempts at loosely psychoanalysing what Reagan and Thatcher saw in each other. Reagan, apparently, was close to his mother and drawn to “compelling women”, while Thatcher “wanted to look up to a man … she wanted to admire a man”. One talking head suggests that they were two lone operators, but once they had found each other, “they were never alone again”. Hmm. There has been a run of outstanding political and historical documentaries on the BBC over the past couple of years, from Once Upon a Time in Iraq to Blair & Brown: The New Labour Revolution, but this is much cosier and far less probing. This is a traditional documentary stuffed to the gills with the people who were there. Unsurprisingly, given his decades in journalism and his previous biographies, Moore has access to those on the inside, and many of the contributors were at the table, or at least hovering very close to it, during the crucial moments of Thatcher and Reagan’s friendship and political relationship. He often greets his interviewees with a familiar tone; this is a man making the most of his connections. It is the sort of sober series that serves an educational purpose, to a point, and if you wanted fireworks and melodrama about a ruthless leader felled by hubris, then you would be watching the Peaky Blinders finale, over on BBC One. But as a result of its traditional approach, I found myself under the influence of what I call the “Cunk effect”, which casts a shadow over documentaries such as this. Any time a presenter is shown ambling down a street as if unaware of the camera, or takes a moment to think, the camera lingering on his thinking face, I faintly wonder when a Diane Morgan voiceover is going to kick in, giving us the full Philomena Cunk experience. This is far too sensible a documentary for that, of course. But I would have enjoyed watching it.",Arts/Television & radio,Thatcher & Reagan: A Very Special Relationship – crying out for a Philomena Cunk voiceover,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/03/thatcher-reagan-a-very-special-relationship-crying-out-for-a-philomena-cunk-voiceover
4/4/2022,"Good morning. There is mounting evidence of indiscriminate killings in Ukraine as investigators find hundreds of bodies in towns near Kyiv. And vulnerable groups will be able to start receiving a fourth Covid vaccine booster from today, as Covid cases across the country rise. Russia stands accused of terrible war crimes as western leaders condemn the killings of unarmed civilians in Bucha and the surrounding areas of Kyiv in alleged atrocities that prompted fresh demands for tougher action against Moscow. Women across Ukraine are also grappling with the threat of rape as a weapon of war as growing evidence of sexual violence emerges from areas retaken from retreating Russian forces. The world was horrified on Sunday by a picture taken by the photographer Mikhail Palinchak on a highway 20km outside the capital, Kyiv, in which the body of one man and three women were piled under a blanket. The Iranian refugee Hossein Latifi has been released from Melbourne’s Park hotel, along with nine other people, after nine years in immigration detention. Latifi was released on Friday – his 33rd birthday. It was the first time in almost a decade he had been able to celebrate outside the walls of a detention centre. Advocates estimate about 20 people were released on Friday from detention centres in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane but it has been difficult to get accurate data on the number of people still detained under the medevac laws. Latifi says recent releases are “absolutely due to the upcoming federal election”. The Victorian government plans to restore an area five times the size of Melbourne as part of a new scheme to increase conservation on private land. The state’s energy, environment and climate change minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, has announced the government will spend $31m to revegetate parcels of private land to create habitat for endangered wildlife and capture carbon. The scheme, known as BushBank, will fund organisations such as Greening Australia, Bush Heritage, Trust for Nature, and traditional owner groups to work with private landowners to restore habitat and increase carbon storage. Melbourne airport must adopt new health-based metrics based on World Health Organization research for its proposed third runway to ensure people aren’t exposed to harmful noise levels, a group of transport experts say. Aged care industry bodies and unions have criticised the Morrison government for failing to commit to fully fund any pay increases ordered as a result of the sector’s work value case. There are 394 domestic violence victims still waiting for a decision on applications made two years ago to Victim Assistance Queensland, according to state government figures tabled last week. People who grew up around Cooma, NSW, hope the hidden incarceration of gay men exposed in The Greatest Menace podcast will be more widely acknowledged. Covid-19 cases in China’s largest city of Shanghai have risen again as millions remain isolated at home under a sweeping lockdown. Health officials on Sunday reported 438 confirmed cases detected over the previous 24 hours, along with 7,788 asymptomatic cases. Both figures were up slightly from the day before. As Joe Biden moved to open US strategic oil reserves, his two biggest oil-producing allies have kept their tanks firmly shut. The UAE and Saudi Arabia continue to rebuff the US president as he attempts to counter soaring oil prices prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And both countries have been unusually frank about their refusal to step in. The influential sister of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has called South Korea’s defence minister a “scum-like guy” for talking about preemptive strikes on the North, warning that the South may face “a serious threat”. A 60-year-old man allegedly had himself vaccinated against Covid-19 dozens of times in Germany in order to sell vaccination cards to people who did not want to get the jab themselves. Dutch extreme athlete, motivational speaker and wellbeing influencer Wim Hof is known as the Iceman. He earned his nickname after setting 26 Guinness world records which include swimming under ice, running a half marathon above the Arctic Circle barefoot, submerging himself in ice for 1hr 52mins and climbing Kilimanjaro in just shorts and sandals. “Don’t tell anybody,” he tells the Guardian. “But I hate the cold!” Our favourite memories and important documents used to be kept as physical objects: photo albums, scrapbooks and postcards. That meant, when we died, these things would be relatively accessible to the loved ones we left behind. In the internet era, a lot of that information is stored in the cloud – and isn’t easily accessible without legacy planning. But some tech platforms now offer options for handling users’ data after death. “I love my children and husband, but I often wish I wasn’t a mother,” writes an anonymous Guardian reader. “I have a good life now, but I feel tormented. I worry about being able to provide for my children, and what kind of world I have brought them into.” Prof Andrew Macintosh spent years working on the integrity of the Australian government’s carbon credit system which gives credits for projects such as regrowing native forests after clearing. Now, he’s turned whistleblower, claiming this system is “a fraud” on the environment, taxpayers and consumers – a claim that the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, has described as “completely unfounded”. Environment editor Adam Morton explains how Australia’s carbon credits system works and speaks to Macintosh about why he thinks this system is broken.

On the surface it is an upbeat, peppy tune. In the context of the Australian team, though, its lyrics take on a more ominous tone. Suddenly the lines “I got the strength to tear it apart” and “we’re taking over the world” do not come across as metaphorical and the idea of some kind of Meg Lanning-controlled dictatorship seems entirely within the realms of possibility. An environmental group has disputed claims by ASX-listed energy company Santos that the leakage of up to 25,000 litres of oil from a facility on an island off WA’s Pilbara coast was a “minor spill”, the WAToday reports. At each of the past five federal elections, one Northern Territory polling booth has switched between favouring our two major parties, making it one of the powerful tools in determining the next prime minister, according to NTNews. The damage bill from the swamping of Sydney’s coastline is expected to run into the millions and it could take beaches up to a year to recover, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Activists from group Scientist Rebellion say they plan to occupy universities this week, calling for climate revolution.
