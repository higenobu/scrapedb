1/14/2022,"Anew Chinese ambassador who has previously worked on the country’s controversial belt and road initiative (BRI) has arrived in New Zealand, prompting speculation Beijing is planning to focus on deepening economic ties with New Zealand as the two countries navigate growing diplomatic challenges. Wang Xiaolong, who replaced former ambassador Wu Xi, previously served as director-general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s department of international economic affairs. In that role, Wang helped oversee the BRI – which seeks to deepen economic ties between China and other countries and is a key focus of President Xi Jinping.  The initiative has prompted some scepticism from world governments, particularly those in the west, about Beijing’s motives, with claims the BRI is largely an influence operation. In December the EU announced Global Gateway, a €300bn infrastructure spending project aimed at countering the BRI. Given Wang’s background, discussions about New Zealand involvement in the BRI could grow, according to Dr Jason Young, director of the Contemporary China Research Centre at Victoria University, who noted that the economic relationship between the two had “held up really well compared to some other countries”. There was some New Zealand interest in the BRI under former prime minister John Key’s centre-right National government. In 2017, China and New Zealand signed a “memorandum of agreement” to develop a plan for New Zealand involvement. However that engagement stalled following the 2017 election of a Labour-New Zealand First coalition, which took a more sceptical view of the BRI amid reports that it involved “debt-trap diplomacy”, with some poorer countries unable to repay Chinese loans for BRI projects. Last year, Wellington indicated a willingness to work with China on “mutually beneficial” BRI projects with an environmental emphasis. It remains unclear what that would involve. Young said the New Zealand-China relationship has also come under pressure due to China’s “far more illiberal” tendencies in recent years, including economic coercion of Australia and repressive policies in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. These challenges prompted New Zealand to criticise China more vocally than previously. It has occasionally signed on to criticisms of China issued by more hawkish Anglosphere countries Australia, the United States, Canada and the UK. The government has expressed concern this could lead to trade repercussions. In an interview with the Guardian in 2021, foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta warned exporters to prepare for a potential “storm” of anger from China. New Zealand officials have also become more cautious about the implications of growing Chinese aggression for the Indo-Pacific and New Zealand itself. A recent report by New Zealand’s Ministry of Defence warned that the country faces “a substantially more challenging environment” due, in part, to China’s “increasingly strong nationalist narrative”. Despite these challenges, New Zealand’s relationship with China remains relatively stable, said Young. “If I were a guessing man, I would suggest [Wang’s] focus will be on maintaining the relationship, in the sense of not having a deterioration like that [which] we saw in Australia”. Across the Tasman, government actions around Chinese political and economic interference sparked diplomatic conflict between the two countries, with China placing significant tariffs on some Australian exports. Recent Australian polling indicates 60% of Australians view China as a security threat. China’s embassy in New Zealand has been approached for comment.

1/14/2022,"The Victorian government has established two medi-hotels to house Covid patients in a bid to alleviate the strain on the state’s hospitals. From Monday, two of Victoria’s quarantine hotels will be converted to facilities for Covid-19 patients, in partnership with the Melbourne Health and Northern Health services.  Victorian health authorities say the Pullman Melbourne and the Mantra Epping will eventually accommodate up to 300 patients once fully operational. At a press conference on Friday, the acting health minister, James Merlino, said all patients would be medically assessed by the hospitals before transfer to ensure they were well enough to be relocated. “They’ll remain under the care of the hospital and still be considered an inpatient even while they’re in the medi-hotel.” COVID-19 patients with low-care needs will be able to transfer to new medi-hotels from Monday, under an initiative to ease pressure on Victoria’s hospital system.(1/2) pic.twitter.com/GOIH7KIbIy Adam Horsburgh, deputy state controller of health system operations, said the medi-hotels would “free up hospital beds for those who most need them”. The announcement comes as the surging Omicron variant continues to place severe strain on the state’s health system. On Monday, Ambulance Victoria issued its second “code red” in a week as a result of the pressures from the pandemic. There are currently 976 people being treated in Victorian hospitals, including 112 in intensive care. On Friday, the state reported 34,836 new Covid cases, bringing the total number of active cases in Victoria to 239,396. There were 18 deaths in the last 24 hours. Horsburgh said: “These hotels will be able to accommodate patients who are both Covid-positive or who may be recovering from Covid and are likely … self-caring, but may need some ongoing clinical monitoring or support and care provided by allied health professionals.” “During the early stages, patients will be referred either from the Northern hospital or the Royal Melbourne into these two hotels. But as the program develops, they will be able to accept referrals from hospitals across the system in Victoria.” Medi-hotel patients will receive care from hospital-in-the-home teams. “Those teams will be able to work much more efficiently than they would normally by not having to move between patients’ homes,” Horsburgh said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Emma Cassar, the head of Victoria’s quarantine program, said the medi-hotels were distinct from the state’s quarantine hotels. “We still have to maintain our capacity within the quarantine program for unvaccinated international arrivals and for members of the public and frontline workers who can’t self-isolate at home,” she said. Cassar said the Pullman Melbourne and the Mantra Epping performed highly on ventilation assessments, with each room fitted with an air purifier. “They are the highest standard of ventilation for the hotels that we can have.” The announcement was welcomed by the Victorian branch of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation. ANMF Victoria’s acting secretary, Paul Gilbert, said the services would free up beds and ease the pressure on nurses caring for Covid patients. “Every nurse and midwife in our hospitals and health services is working above and beyond anything experienced before trying to care for an increasing number of patients with fewer staff because they are Covid positive or are close contacts,” Gilbert said in a statement. “The furloughing of thousands of staff, causing the last-resort move to surge workforce models, is taking a toll on exhausted nurses and midwives who’ve worked through this pandemic in varying degrees of crisis-mode for almost two years.” On Friday the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, ruled out a similar program in the state, pointing to updated modelling released by the state’s health department which showed hospitalisations were tracking below best-case scenarios released last week.“The tracking today is very reassuring, please don’t take that to mean the health system isn’t under pressure, we’re in a pandemic, all hospital systems are under pressure right around the world,” he said. “What you can see today is that we should have confidence that we have the capacity within our system.”",News/Australia news,Victoria to establish medi-hotels for Covid patients to ease severe pressure on hospitals,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/14/victoria-to-establish-medi-hotels-for-covid-patients-to-ease-severe-pressure-on-hospitals
