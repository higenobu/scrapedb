4/3/2022,"This should have been the year that put Will Smith right back at the top. Tipped to win the Oscar that had eluded him twice before, the Hollywood star also had a string of high-profile roles ahead of him. But Smith’s extraordinary attack on presenter Chris Rock during the awards ceremony ended all that. And if Smith believes his resignation from Hollywood’s film academy this weekend might draw a line under the affair, he will be disappointed. Although the 53-year-old is unlikely to be stripped of his best actor statuette, his commercial appeal to producers has been seriously damaged. He was due to appear in a run of major films, including Bad Boys 4, Bright 2 and Apple’s Emancipation, but all of these projects are now uncertain. Apple’s decision on Emancipation, in which Smith plays a runaway slave, may prove crucial. An expected awards contender, it was due to come out later this year. On Saturday film star Denzel Washington said: “For whatever reason, the devil got a hold of him that night.” And film-makers may take a long time to forget his actions. The actor’s violent response to comedian Chris Rock’s joke about the appearance of his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, is also likely to have a continued impact on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences itself. Smith’s resignation came with an abject apology. “The list of those I have hurt is long and includes Chris, his family, many of my dear friends and loved ones, all those in attendance, and global audiences at home,” he said on Friday night. “I betrayed the trust of the academy. I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken.” But this has not put a stop to the academy’s investigation of his conduct. It will also review its own handling of the incident. The attack could expose the academy to legal action, according to employment law experts. In legal terms Rock, who was hired to appear as a host, counts as “a contractor”. And, while the ceremony was not a typical employment setting, Rock was effectively attacked by “a customer”. “It’s reminiscent of companies with poor management and poor leadership where there is workplace violence or sexual harassment,” said employment lawyer Peter Glennon. “Nothing was done, and not only was he allowed to stay, not removed, but he was given an award.” “Later, the academy comes out and says it does not condone violence, but who does? They realised they had to go further, and said they were going to investigate. But what is there to investigate? The whole world saw a blatant act of violence,” said Glennon. Scrutiny has been focused on the academy’s actions while the ceremony was still being broadcast. Speaking on American television, the show’s producer, Will Packer, said he had told the academy: “Rock has made it clear that he does not want to make a bad situation worse.” In Packer’s view, Rock’s “tone was not retaliatory. His tone was not angry. So I was advocating what Rock wanted at that time, which was not to physically remove Will Smith at that time, because, as it has now been explained to me, that was the only option at that point. “It has been explained to me that there was a conversation that I was not a part of to ask him to voluntarily leave.” According to Packer, Rock also told police officers at the ceremony he did not want an arrest: “They were laying out the options, and as they were talking, Chris was being very dismissive of those options. He was like, ‘No, I’m fine.’” Though Rock told the police he would not press charges, the comedian could still sue the academy, as well as Smith, the show-runners and the security in control of the event. “He has a civil cause of action against Smith and a legal claim against the academy for not ensuring a safe environment,” said Glennon. Nor are the police bound to Rock’s decision to not press charges. “When police observe a criminal act that’s beyond reasonable suspicion, they have the right to arrest the individual,” Glennon said. In those circumstances, it falls to the prosecutor to decide whether to press charges. In 2017, the academy published an updated code of conduct in response to the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal. The new standards, the academy’s leadership said, reflected and codified the organisation’s values of “respect for human dignity, inclusion, and a supportive environment that fosters creativity”. “There is no place in the academy for people who abuse their status, power or influence in a manner that violates recognised standards of decency,” it said. Glennon said: “With Harvey Weinstein everybody knew it, but nobody said anything because of his power and privilege. The academy took a stance on Weinstein and adopted a code of conduct. Now we’ll see if they’re going to stand by their stated values. Everybody wants to know what happens to the powerful and privileged in these types of situations. It looks like the academy dropped the ball.” Many Oscar guests are still troubled by the standing ovation Smith received after his tearful acceptance speech for his role in King Richard, playing the father of Venus and Serena Williams. He apologised to the academy and his fellow nominees, framing himself as a “defender of his family”. But later that night he danced and posed with the golden statuette at after-show parties. Smith’s resignation letter this weekend suggests he wants to address his bad behaviour and is “committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason”. He may reveal he is undergoing therapy for anger issues and perhaps take up charity work for a period. He already has a platform for a confessional interview on his wife’s talk show, Red Table Talk. In a 2020 appearance on this show Smith discussed problems in his marital relationship. It is also where Pinkett Smith revealed she had alopecia.",Arts/Film,Will Smith quits the Oscars academy – but that won’t make his troubles go away,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/02/will-smith-quits-the-oscars-academy-but-that-wont-make-his-troubles-go-away
4/3/2022,"Like the post-credits sequence at the end of a superhero film, the saga of the acrimonious Handforth council meeting that went viral in 2021 has finally released its postscript. It has been over a year since the heroic Jackie Weaver wrangled the meeting into some kind of order, by muting and booting out the furious men who tried to shout her down and told her she had “no authority here”. She became a symbol of no-nonsense stoicism, a steady hand in the wild west of lockdown Zooms. In a world of online rage, so the story went, we could all try being a bit more her. Weaver became a star of sorts, giving interviews and writing a self-help book called You Do Have the Authority Here, subtitled #What Would Jackie Weaver Do?). But as much as this looked primed for a happy ending – the rise of Weaver, the fall of fury – Handforth council, rebranded now as town and not parish, has opted to close the whole affair with a bang. Six investigations into councillor misconduct were made public last week, after initially being published in May last year. Three of them focused on the chaos of that Zoom meeting and came to a dramatic conclusion. This was a classic plot twist. It’s the finale of season one of The Good Place, it’s the Red Wedding episode of Game of Thrones. The report decided that Weaver had no authority to do what she did, after all. Presumably her book is being reissued with a new cover and titled: Technically You Don’t Have the Authority Here, #What Would Jackie Weaver Do Anyway? The report was sympathetic towards Weaver’s actions, citing the “unusual and difficult circumstances” she faced, but described her actions as being “without any formal footing in terms of appropriate process and procedure”. I couldn’t help but feel as if I’d just watched my favourite team lose. Really, did it matter who had the procedural authority when Weaver had the moral authority? As funny as it was, the atmosphere on that Zoom meeting was poisonous. Her triumph was about more than just the rules. But I imagine that this attitude is probably what got that meeting into such a pickle in the first place and it is definitely not very #What-Would-Jackie-Weaver-Do? of me. Weaver herself was much more proper about it all, telling the BBC that she welcomed the findings, “but am deeply saddened that it took so long and cost so much to get there”. Classy. Because that is what Jackie Weaver would do. Bridgerton has returned to Netflix for a second series, which has been criticised for its lack of raunch, although this has done nothing to stem the tide of Bridgerton fever. My inbox has never had so many “get the Bridgerton look/house/attitude!” emails (though I notice none for “get the Bridgerton early 19th-century life expectancy!”). This season features more of Lady Danbury, which means more Adjoa Andoh, the woman who plays her. I’m going off on a tangent here, but one lasting legacy of the lockdown months was that I got into audiobooks for the first time since I was a child. I found them very comforting, and still do. I hadn’t given their narrators much thought before, but it turns out that it’s an immense skill and a good narrator can elevate a story, just as a bad one can ruin it. Andoh is pretty much the best there is. She does the voices without “doing the voices” and at this stage, her name attached to the reading of any story would sell it to me. She has read Americanah and Pride and Prejudice, but best of all, she read Lauren Groff’s magnificent Matrix and she brought it to life beautifully. The opening lick (just what is it about describing elements of rock music that brings on an instant Alan Partridge voice?) to Guns N’ Roses’ Sweet Child O’ Mine has been named the best guitar riff of all time, in a poll of 1,500 people, carried out by software company Muse Group. The 1988 hit, built around that enduring melody by guitarist Slash, the soundtrack to many a wedding and school disco, beat Eye of the Tiger, Another One Bites the Dust and, oddly, Sex on Fire by Kings of Leon, which isn’t even Kings of Leon’s best riff; that is surely Molly’s Chamber and I’m as surprised as anyone that I have a strong opinion on Kings of Leon’s guitar legacy. It may come as no surprise that there are few women in the top 20, though it did find space for a bass line (Fleetwood Mac’s The Chain). Joan Jett gets a look-in for I Love Rock’n’Roll and the White Stripes and Fleetwood Mac had female members, which counts, but this list reads as if it’s from the era of those guitar magazines that featured a bikini-wearing woman on the cover, holding a guitar as if she were helplessly sexually attracted to it. It is the sort of list that Nirvana (number seven, Smells Like Teen Spirit), a band with famous disdain for rock’n’roll machismo, would have hated. It’s not that there is a vast trove of female guitarists in the long history of rock music who have been unfairly passed over. It was a male old world. But I do hope that in 20 years’ time, a list like this might have more women than Joan Jett on it.

4/3/2022,"Rory Burns has “put to bed” the disappointment of his poor Ashes showing and is eager to make a swift return to the England squad. Described by Surrey’s head coach, Gareth Batty, as “the best opener in the country”, England’s most productive run-scorer at the top of the order since he made his debut in November 2018 struggled in Australia. He scored 77 runs from six innings and registered two ducks, including one off the first ball of the series. “Did I visualise getting a first-baller? No, I didn’t,” the Surrey captain says of his leg-side waft to Mitchell Starc that left him comprehensively bowled and set in motion England’s 4-0 defeat. “I’ve kind of put it to bed. I had some good time off when I came home. Lots of family time. I reassessed my game and tried to work on various things from a technical aspect. Just little tweaks I could make to then go again.” Burns did not divulge any details of the work he has put in over the winter. “There are county attacks looming around the corner,” he says as Surrey prepare for the start of the County Championship on Thursday. However, he did admit that watching England’s tour of the West Indies from afar has given him extra impetus for a summer when England play three Tests each against New Zealand and South Africa. “I had to deal with what I’d been dealt,” he says of his omission from the Test squad. “I’m still looking to improve, still looking to get better. I think I can. I’ll go again and try to score runs.” The 31-year-old leads a young Surrey squad with half the group under the age of 25 and though some, such as Burns, Ollie Pope, Ben Foakes and Amar Virdi, were regulars throughout the triumphant 2018 season, it is a much-changed team from the one that won 10 of their 14 matches. “We’ve lost experience,” Burns says of Jade Dernbach and Rikki Clarke. “But it’s exciting because the lads have places to fill and opportunities to grasp.” Hashim Amla’s return to the Oval is welcome news for Burns on two fronts. “That would make me not the oldest player in the XI,” Burns says of the 39-year-old former South Africa captain. More importantly, the veteran of 124 Tests with more than 18,000 first-class runs faced similar challenges to Burns. Amla was prolific at domestic level but dropped from the Test team after scoring 36 runs in two home Tests against England in 2004. His unorthodox technique was blamed but rather than an overhaul, after making a few refinements he returned to the side 14 months later with 149 against New Zealand in Cape Town. Now that he has put the Ashes to bed, Burns will hope his season follows a similar storyline.",Sport/Sport,‘The Ashes? I’ve kind of put it to bed’: Rory Burns targets England Test return,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/02/the-ashes-ive-kind-of-put-it-to-bed-rory-burns-targets-england-test-return
4/3/2022,"Even for a leader as cloistered as Vladimir Putin, the torrent of bad news from Ukraine should be impossible to ignore. The Russian army’s rapid retreat from Kyiv last week has made clear the scale of its failure, leaving behind the bodies of Russian soldiers and the burnt-out carcasses of hundreds of tanks and other military vehicles. The goal of a knockout blow against Kyiv has been abandoned and Russia is facing the toughest sanctions ever enacted against a superpower. Was it misinformation from a cadre of yes-men that led the Russian leader down this path? That is what US and European intelligence argued last week, saying the Kremlin leader is now raging at his advisers, in particular the military leadership that got him into this mess. “His senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth,” said Kate Bedingfield, director of communications at the White House. The response from the Kremlin was predictable. “It looks like neither the Department of State nor the Pentagon know what is really happening in the Kremlin,” said Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman. “They simply do not understand what is going on. They do not understand President Putin. They do not understand the decision-making mechanism. They do not understand our working style.” Few people can claim to do so at this point. “From what I know, the circle Putin talks to is very small,” said Farida Rustamova, an independent Russian journalist who has reported on the mood among officials since the war began. “Only a handful of people are allowed to see him in person and they have to be at a distance. And only very few have phone access with him. But that access is only one way, as in Putin contacts them, not the other way around.” Each week, Putin holds a video call with his security council, a group of mainly hard-liners and technocrats that has become his wartime cabinet since the invasion of Ukraine. Among them are the siloviki, the security chiefs who appear in pole position for Putin’s ear. They include Nikolai Patrushev, the former KGB officer whom Putin met in Leningrad in the 1970s, the FSB head Alexander Bortnikov whom Putin has also known for four decades, the technocratic defence minister Sergei Shoigu, and Sergei Naryshkin, Putin’s head of foreign intelligence. Their suspicion of the west and tendency toward conspiracy theory make them natural allies of the Russian president at war. But even they appeared to be securely under Putin’s thumb during a televised meeting days before the invasion, a piece of political theatre that left Naryshkin stuttering as Putin browbeat him to “speak plainly”. “It is clear it is an extremely centralised system which got only more centralised during the war,” said Vladimir Gelman, a Russian politics professor at the University of Helsinki. “The Kremlin is like the solar system, with Putin being the sun and all the planets of different orbits around him. At the security council meeting … it was really telling just how little influence the members of the council had.” Outside of those meetings, which are almost always held behind closed doors, insiders say that you wait until he contacts you. That includes the economic bloc of the government, including prime minister Mikhail Mishustin and Central Bank head Elvira Nabiullina, Rustamova said. And it would include Shoigu and the army chief of staff Valery Gerasimov, as well. The two men disappeared from public for nearly two weeks last month, prompting rumours that the defence chiefs had already been punished for Russia’s chaotic start to the war. In an extremely embarrassing episode, the defence ministry was forced to admit it had sent conscripts into combat missions after some had been captured and killed in Ukraine. Putin had previously denied there were any conscripts fighting in Ukraine at all. But despite signs that Putin was angry with Shoigu, analysts warned he was unlikely to sack the defence chief in the middle of a major military operation. “[Shoigu] has made himself completely indispensable and that’s how he got back,” said Andrei Soldatov, an author who has written extensively on the Russian security services. “Who could replace him? He’s the third or second most popular politician in the country.” The Russian leader values loyalty and, as a result, his cabinet after two decades in power is populated with loyalists. “Putin likes to repeat the phrase ‘there’s no one else to do the job’,” said Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of R.Politik political analysis firm. “Shoigu is his person. He has … failures at work, shortcomings, mistakes. But will somebody else do a better job? So I wouldn’t make any conclusions about how Putin is tearing his hair out over how Shoigu has betrayed him and let him down.” Critics have pointed to the reported detentions of several high-level FSB officers and the sacking of a top general in the Rosgvardia, or National Guard, as evidence of a growing schism over the war or possible purge for its poor execution. But experts have said the Kremlin ranks largely appear to be holding, with few discernible changes among Putin’s advisers as he seeks to consolidate his support under heavy pressure from the west. “I think [Putin’s] unhappy with the performance,” said Soldatov. “But it doesn’t mean that people inside are ready for a coup d’etat or anything like that. That’s just wishful thinking.” Seeking leverage with the Kremlin, western countries have sanctioned oligarchs seen as loyal to Putin, betting that he may listen to the moneymen who hold billions in assets. Among those hit with UK sanctions is Roman Abramovich, the billionaire former Chelsea owner who unexpectedly surfaced at informal negotiations in Istanbul and in Kyiv last month, where he and two members of the Ukrainian team claimed that they had been poisoned. But the oligarchs themselves claim it has been years since they have had the Kremlin’s ear, long since forced out by the former KGB hawks and other loyalists whom Putin has installed in the last 20 years. “There is no point for people like me to try to talk to the Kremlin,” an oligarch who has known Putin since the 1990s told the Observer. “It doesn’t work that way. Let’s not be naive. We haven’t had any access in years.” The business leaders said they were kept in the dark about the invasion until after it began, when Putin summoned many of them to a meeting to demand their loyalty. “This conflict was obviously not discussed with the business community,” said the oligarch. “We were just told the day after the invasion that everything will be OK but that there was no choice. It is not a debate or a discussion. The system has developed over the years; of course there were different blocs in the beginning, but after Crimea it became clear that there wasn’t place for the more so-called liberal wing. And the pandemic made the very top more isolated.” Some of those former liberal advisers have already left the country. Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation chief under Boris Yeltsin who had remade himself as a state-backed executive and then adviser to Putin on environmental issues, resigned and left Russia for Turkey last month. Arkady Dvorkovich, a former Kremlin economic adviser, stepped down as head of the Skolkovo Foundation under state pressure after criticising the war in an interview. And Alexei Kudrin, another top liberal adviser who has known Putin for decades, also advised him to abandon the invasion, Rustamova said. According to her sources, Kudrin spoke to Putin shortly after the war began. During the conversation, he “warned Putin about the consequences of the war: that the economy would slide back to the early 1990s, and that this could lead to social instability. But there was no reaction from Putin to all of this. Putin has the same answer to everyone who is worried about this war – Russia had no other option.” “There is a general attitude that even if someone could reach him, it wouldn’t really make a difference, that his mind is set,” said Rustamova. All this pushes back against the idea that Putin has been misled about the scale of the war – rather he has chosen not to listen any more. The natural competition among Putin’s advisers, even among the hardliners, also means that they would likely be keen to point out the others’ mistakes. “It’s impossible to hide everything,” said Stanovaya. “We know that there’s serious competition within the security services. So if the army makes a mistake, we know there are a lot of people ready to report on that, from [Chechnya head] Ramzan Kadyrov to the FSB. So I would not say that Putin is misinformed now. But it’s possible he receives his information late.” As the war has continued, that factionalism has only grown stronger. Kadyrov, the dictatorial leader of Chechnya who has feuded with Russia’s security services, has also strongly criticised the negotiations led by Kremlin advisor Vladimir Medinsky. After Medinsky announced that Russia would pull back some forces from Kyiv, Kadyrov said that “Medinsky made a mistake, made an incorrect wording ... And if you think that he [Putin] will quit what he started just the way it is presented to us today, this is not true.” “Factionalism is always a feature of the Russian political system,” said Ben Noble, an associate professor in Russian politics at University College London. “However, given that it is an invasion that is going wrong, these factional splits can have an existential edge to them.” The rumour mill, where the temporary disappearance of a public figure like Shoigu can quickly lead to breathless predictions of a purge or a coup, also has a momentum of its own during the invasion. “Given the opacity of the regime, the intrigue about palace coups becomes a dynamic in itself that can become completely divorced from what’s happening on the ground,” Noble said. “And it’s not just a storm in a teacup that’s being imagined by western observers. It’s highly plausible that these are precisely the conversations, rumours and whispers that are taking place in Moscow.”",News/World news,Who has Putin’s ear?

4/3/2022,"Rob Baxter said Exeter were ‘getting towards last chance saloon’ in the run-up to this pulsating victory against an ever-improving Bath. Although the hosts eventually ground out a bonus-point success on a cold, bright day in Devon, the ultimate outcome of their bid for the playoffs remains out of their hands. Second-half tries by Billy Keast, Stuart Hogg and Santiago Grondona decisively put an end to Bath’s resistance, while their top-four rivals Gloucester were defeated at home by Wasps. Welcome news for the Exeter fans, although Gloucester’s two matches in hand may yet prove decisive. For Exeter, a club that have finished in the Premiership’s top two for each of the past six seasons, including a hat-trick of first-place finishes from 2018-2020, it is unwelcome territory. Baxter said this week he is open to talking to the RFU regarding Eddie Jones’s succession, and if he does become involved with England, he may consider some of the young Bath players who chucked the ball around with such enthusiasm at Sandy Park. At 22, Tom de Glanville looks increasingly likely to graduate to the senior international side, while the 30-year-old Jonathan Joseph is consistently displaying the kind of awareness and creativity that Jones’s England midfield is crying out for. Exeter’s Henry Slade was absent here due to a mandatory rest break, along with the No 8 Sam Simmonds, and Baxter will be heartened by the scoring of six tries in their absence. Bath’s Sam Underhill, meanwhile, was sublime in attack and defence and created two tries in the first half. He set the tone for another eye-catching afternoon after receiving an offload from Max Clark and calmly passing to Joe Cokanasiga who touched down the opening try. That came after Exeter had started strongly, pinning Bath back for most of the first 10 minutes, but failing to come away with a point. Exeter hit back immediately when Jacques Vermeulen cantered over, and Joe Simmonds’s fine strike off the tee made it 7-7. Bath kept coming and kept offloading: Will Muir and De Glanville both produced superb passes to start a move which finished with Underhill the creator again, this time passing to the No 6 Josh Bayliss, whose wonderfully silky sidestep left Tom Hendrickson wrong-footed. Cokanasiga soon added his second try, and it was shaping up to be a second straight home defeat for Exeter. Bath paid for their high-risk approach just before half-time when an intercept by Exeter created the space for Stuart Hogg to sprint clear. He appeared to have no support available, but produced a sumptuous angled grubber kick for the Namibian front row Patrick Schickerling to chase. Schickerling gathered, was held up just short, but Dave Ewers pounced for Exeter’s second try. On the stroke of half-time Exeter shoved to within a couple of metres, after Hogg kicked a penalty to the corner, and Schickerling barrelled over. Hogg’s conversion made it a one-point game at half-time, 21-22 to Bath. Bath tore into the second half with the same hunger for risk and a Muir effort was ruled out for a knock-on after he had hacked ahead a floating pass from De Glanville. Muir intervened at the other end with a fine tap tackle on Ian Whitten, the Exeter outside centre, but Exeter kept up the momentum, and Tom O’Flaherty scored in the corner, only for the TMO to disallow the try for obstruction by Hogg, who prevented Cokanasiga from making a tackle. The second half remained scoreless as the match moved into the final quarter – until a scrum penalty led to the replacement Keast edging Exeter back in front by bundling over the try-line, sealing a bonus point with a classic display of the home side’s power. Simmonds converted, they were six ahead, and Baxter’s men then shifted into another gear. Hogg had tonnes of space to virtually walk over the line on Exeter’s right, and Grondona, another replacement, touched down after another muscular drive on the opposite flank.

4/3/2022,"The far-right activist Tommy Robinson has said he has been detained in Mexico while attempting to visit the country on holiday, despite repeated claims of bankruptcy. The English Defence League founder, whose real name is Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon, shared a video on Saturday saying that he had been detained in Cancún airport upon arrival with his children. “I’m being deported as a matter of national security,” Robinson says in the video, in which he questions the decision to detain him, claiming to have done nothing but “criticise Islam”. Robinson has been convicted in the UK for fraud, stalking, assault, using someone else’s passport, using threatening behaviour, and contempt of court. Robinson said his three children were with a friend who was travelling with them. The video emerged the week after he failed to attend a high court hearing where he was to be questioned about his finances after losing a libel case. Robinson claimed he was bankrupt after losing a libel case brought against him by Jamal Hijazi, now 18, last year. Robinson was sued after falsely claiming in Facebook videos that Hijazi, who had been filmed being attacked at school in 2018, was “not innocent and he violently attacks young English girls in his school”. He was ordered to pay £100,000 in libel damages. Robinson could face jail over possible contempt of court for not turning up to last week’s hearing, with the judge saying on 22 March that he could only refer the matter to a high court judge to consider if there had been contempt. Judge Dagnall said that while there may be a reason for why he did not attend, “he knew perfectly well that this hearing was going to take place”. Nick Lowles, CEO of Hope Not Hate, the UK’s leading antifascism and antiracism campaign group, said, “Tommy Robinson was apparently detained in Mexico after trying to go on holiday. Yet he has repeatedly claimed that he is bankrupt. Just last week, Robinson failed to attend court regarding the ongoing investigation into his bankruptcy. “The very fact that a supposedly bankrupt man can afford to go on holiday to Mexico speaks for itself.” Lowles said Hope Not Hate believes that Robinson could have up to £3m in assets, and that the organisation has collected evidence to prove it. “Tommy Robinson’s reputation for spreading vitriol and hate has clearly reached an international scale,” he said. Hijazi’s lawyer, Ian Helme, had also questioned Robinson’s claim of bankruptcy, telling the court there was information “that what is stated in his bankruptcy application is not a full account of [Robinson’s] assets”.
