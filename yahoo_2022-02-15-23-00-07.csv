2/15/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. intelligence officials on Tuesday accused a conservative financial news website with a significant American readership of amplifying Kremlin propaganda and alleged five media outlets targeting Ukrainians have taken direction from Russian spies. The officials said Zero Hedge, which has 1.2 million Twitter followers, published articles created by Moscow-controlled media that were then shared by outlets and people unaware of their nexus to Russian intelligence. The officials did not say whether they thought Zero Hedge knew of any links to spy agencies and did not allege direct links between the website and Russia. Zero Hedge denied the claims and said it tries to “publish a wide spectrum of views that cover both sides of a given story.” The officials briefed The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence sources. It was the latest effort by President Joe Biden's administration to release U.S. intelligence findings about Russian activity involving Ukraine as part of a concerted push to expose and influence the moves of Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. officials previously accused Putin of planning a “false-flag” operation to create a pretext for a new invasion of Ukraine and detailed what they believe are final-stage Russian preparations for an assault. It’s unclear whether U.S. efforts are changing Putin’s behavior. And without releasing more proof of its findings, Washington has been criticized and reminded of past intelligence failures such as the debunked allegations that pre-war Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Zero Hedge has been sharply critical of Biden and posted stories about allegations of wrongdoing by his son Hunter. While perhaps best known for its coverage of markets and finance, the website also covers politics with a conservative bent. In recent months, Zero Hedge has published numerous articles that accused the U.S. of fomenting panic about Ukraine, which now faces the possibility of an invasion by more than 130,000 Russian troops massed on several sides of the country. Some of those articles are listed as being written by people affiliated with the Strategic Culture Foundation. The Biden administration sanctioned the foundation last year for allegedly taking part in Russia’s interference in the 2020 U.S. election. U.S. intelligence officials allege the foundation's leaders ultimately take direction from the SVR, the Russian foreign intelligence service. Recent articles listed as authored by the foundation and published by Zero Hedge include the headlines: ""NATO Sliding Towards War Against Russia In Ukraine,” “Americans Need A Conspiracy Theory They Can All Agree On"" and “Theater Of Absurd... Pentagon Demands Russia Explain Troops On Russian Soil."" In an email, the website said there “is no relationship between Strategic Cultural Foundation (or the SVR) and Zero Hedge, and furthermore this is the first time we hear someone allege that the Foundation is linked to Russian propaganda."" “They are one of our hundreds of contributors — unlike Mainstream Media, we try to publish a wide spectrum of views that cover both sides of a given story,"" the website said. Disinformation has long been used by Putin against adversaries, including the United States, and as one tool in regional conflicts to accompany cyberattacks and the movement of military forces. Washington and Kyiv have for months highlighted the issue of Russian influence in Ukrainian media. Intelligence officials on Monday named two websites they said were directed by the Strategic Culture Foundation. Three other websites are alleged to have ties to the FSB, Russia's federal security service. “These sites enable the Russian government to secure support among the Russian and Ukrainian populations,” one official said. “This is the primary vector for how the Russian government will bolster support domestically for an invasion into Ukraine.” Officials described for the first time what they say are direct communications between Russian spies and the editors or directors of the media outlets. They did not release records of the communications. FSB officers had directed Konstantin Knyrik, the head of NewsFront, to write stories specifically damaging to Ukraine's image, U.S. officials alleged. They said Knyrik has been praised by senior FSB officers for his work and requested derogatory information that he could use against the Caucasian Knot, a website that covers news in the Caucasus, where Russia has also maintained conflicts with smaller neighbors. The editor of PolitNavigator sent reports of published articles to the FSB, an official said. And the managing editor of Antifashist allegedly was directed at least once by the FSB to delete material from the site. The Strategic Culture Foundation is accused of controlling the websites Odna Rodyna and Fondsk. The foundation's director, Vladimir Maximenko, has met with SVR handlers multiple times since 2014, officials alleged. Several of the sites have small social media followings and may not appear influential at first glance, noted Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy. But falsehoods or propaganda narratives often start small before they're amplified by larger actors, he said. “You see the narrative enter the information space, and it’s very hard to see where it goes from there,"" he said. A manifesto published on Zero Hedge's site defends its use of anonymous authors and proclaims its goal is “to liberate oppressed knowledge.” Many articles are published under the name Tyler Durden, also a character in the movie “Fight Club.” The website was an early amplifier of conspiracy theories and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. An Associated Press investigation determined the site played a pivotal role in advancing the unproven theory that China engineered the virus as a bioweapon. It’s also posted articles touting natural immunity to COVID-19 and unproven treatments. Zero Hedge was also cited in a recent report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue that examined how far-right extremists are harnessing COVID-19 misinformation to expand their reach. Twitter briefly suspended Zero Hedge’s account in 2020 but reinstated it a few months later, saying it “made an error in our enforcement action in this case.” The U.S. moving to name the website could inform some people who come across its content online, Schafer said. “My guess is that most of the people who are loyal Zero Hedge followers naturally are inclined to mistrust the U.S. government anyway,"" he said, “and so this announcement is probably not going to undermine most of Zero Hedge’s core support.” ___ Associated Press journalists Angela Charlton in Paris and David Klepper in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.",Politics/Associated Press,US accuses financial website of spreading Russian propaganda,https://news.yahoo.com/us-accuses-financial-website-spreading-122709021.html
2/15/2022,"A priest in Arizona performed thousands of baptisms incorrectly by erroneously changing one word of the sacrament. The one-word error rendered thousands of baptisms performed by Father Andres Arango invalid. No one, including priests, ""may add, remove, or change anything in the liturgy on his own authority,"" according to the Diocese of Phoenix. A Catholic priest based in Phoenix, Arizona, has resigned after realizing he'd been incorrectly performing baptisms for over 20 years, rendering the rite invalid for thousands of people. As he administered the ritual, Rev. Andres Arango would say, ""We baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit."" However, the correct wording is ""I baptize,"" per the Vatican's instruction, wrote Thomas J. Olmsted, Bishop of the Diocese of Phoenix, in a January 14 message. No one, including priests, ""may add, remove, or change anything in the liturgy on his own authority,"" Olmsted wrote, citing Vatican teachings. Olmsted added that he didn't believe Father Arango had ""intentions to harm the faithful or deprive them of the grace of baptism and the sacraments."" Still, the official Diocese of Phoenix website said that Father Arango's one-word alteration means that ""all of the baptisms he has performed until June 17, 2021, are presumed invalid."" The diocese also called for those who believe Father Arango had incorrectly baptized them to submit their contact details to receive the proper rite. In an open letter, Father Arango apologized for his error and announced that he had resigned as pastor of the St. Gregory parish in Phoenix as of February 1. ""It saddens me to learn that I have performed invalid baptisms throughout my ministry as a priest by regularly using an incorrect formula,"" he wrote. ""With the help of the Holy Spirit and in communion with the Diocese of Phoenix, I will dedicate my energy and full-time ministry to help remedy this and heal those affected,"" he added. According to the Catholic News Service. Father Arango previously served in parishes in Brazil and San Diego. The diocese told USA Today that he had administered thousands of baptisms throughout his ministry. Catholic baptisms involve water being poured on a person's head to signify they have been purified and are now part of the Church. Baptisms are typically performed on infants and are considered a requirement for Catholic salvation. Despite the error, some St. Gregory Catholic Church members have launched a petition asking Father Arango to stay on as pastor of their parish. ""As part of his pastoral leadership, Father Andres reinvigorated the church community by renovating its facilities, giving parishioners and faith seekers a spiritual home that is open to all,"" it said. ""The St. Gregory's community will never be the same without him."" Father Arango's blunder was not the first time a one-word alteration has affected baptisms in the US. In 2020, Father Matthew Hood in Detroit realized while watching a family video that the deacon who baptized him as a baby had also used the wrong phrase of ""We baptize you."" The discovery resulted in Father Hood being re-baptized, then re-confirmed, and subsequently re-ordained. The mistake also affected the validity of the sacraments that Father Hood had previously performed for his parishioners. The Archbishop of Detroit, Allen H. Vigneron, apologized on behalf of the local Church and attributed the discrepancy to ""human error.""
