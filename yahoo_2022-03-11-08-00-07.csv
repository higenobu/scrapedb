3/11/2022,"Ukraine's Ministry of Defense released a video of artillery strikes on vehicles outside of Kyiv. The aerial footage, dated March 8, shows at least eight strikes outside the town of Borodyanka. Borodyanka is about 45 miles from the center of Kyiv, and has been the scene of fierce fighting. A video released Thursday by the Ukrainian military showed artillery strikes on what officials said was a line of Russian military vehicles not far from Kyiv. The aerial footage appears to have been recorded at a distance by a drone. It shows at least eight strikes on vehicles on a rural road identified by the Ukrainian defense ministry as being outside the town of Borodyanka. The video, dated to Tuesday, was posted on Facebook and Twitter on Thursday to channels run by the Ukrainian armed forces. —Defence of Ukraine (@DefenceU) March 10, 2022 The footage pauses at the moment of a burst of fire on the central vehicle in a line of three — either tanks or other self-propelled artillery. Then the other two appear to be picked off. Further strikes follow. Insider used geolocation to identify the likely location of the strikes. Satellite imagery showed a distinctive road formation and gas station that matched the aerial footage. Lt. Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander in chief of Ukraine's army, described the operation as ""delicate,"" according to the defense ministry. It is a distinction Ukrainian forces might be keen to emphasize in the face of shelling from Russian forces that has hit residential buildings, schools, and hospitals.

The town of about 13,000 was bombarded in the Russian advance. On March 3, drone footage emerged of the town's devastation, showing the still-smoking remains of apartment buildings. Local media reported that one of the places hit was a veterans' rehabilitation center, according to the Kyiv Independent. A Pentagon assessment of Russian advances on Kyiv from Tuesday said that a major column of Russian forces in the region remained. ""Near Kyiv, we still observe that Russian forces have not moved closer to the city center,"" a Defense Department official said. ""The closest they've been able to get is the airport."" In briefings on Tuesday and Wednesday, a Pentagon official said that about 90 to 95% of Russian combat power remains intact, despite fierce resistance from Ukraine and widespread video and photo evidence of destroyed Russian forces.

3/11/2022,"A terrifying encounter between a Florida paddleboarder and an 11-foot, 10-inch alligator has ended in the reptile being killed as a potential threat to humans, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The alligator was trapped Feb. 22 and removed at the request of Silver Springs State Park, where the incident occurred in September, state officials told McClatchy News. It was dispatched with a shot to the head, Fresh Take Florida reported, and state wildlife officials say its body was processed for its hide and meat. The deadly measure was authorized after photos and video surfaced on social media of the alligator swimming up close to paddleboarder Vicki Reamy Baker, including bumping its snout against the craft. Baker is seen pushing the alligator away with her paddle, only to hear the alligator hiss in frustration. “Why are you messing with me? Why are you trying to bite me?” Baker is heard saying in one video. “I’ve never had an alligator after me like that before. Look how close he is to me. He came after me and tried to bite my paddleboard. Somebody has been feeding that gator. Makes them very dangerous.” In one video, an observer is heard telling Baker she should back away from the alligator “considering you just made him pretty mad,” after she pushed the gator away with her paddle. Baker said she was paddleboarding with two other people at the time and they reported the incident to a park ranger when they returned to shore. The 4,000-acre park, about 80 miles northwest of Orlando, includes “the entire 5-mile Silver River and surrounding sandhill forest.” “He came up fast and out of nowhere. Scared the daylights out of me,” Baker wrote on Facebook. “My feet were in the water and I was talking to my friends. I didn’t have time to do anything but react. No way was I standing up. I would have fallen in the water.” The park’s request to remove the alligator as a “nuisance” has faced some criticism on social media, including those who say Baker should have handled the situation differently. However, others — including the park’s managers — saw aggression and potential threat in the reptile’s familiarity with close human contact. “Gators are usually afraid of people but when people feed them they lose their fear,” one woman wrote on Facebook. “If people did not feed the gator he would’ve stayed away from the people.” Florida has an estimated 1.3 million alligators and they can be found in the waterways of all 67 counties, the state says. “Nuisance alligators” are defined as those that are “at least 4 feet in length and believed to pose a threat to people, pets or property,” the state says. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission provides nuisance alligator removal services at no cost, using contracted trappers. The trappers get to keep the alligator carcass for its meat and hide as part of their compensation, the state says.

3/11/2022,"By John Irish and Francois Murphy VIENNA (Reuters) - Parties trying to revive the Iran nuclear deal scrambled on Wednesday to resolve last-minute Russian demands that threaten to scupper negotiations, diplomats said, with the United States appearing unwilling to engage with Russia on the matter. Western powers on Tuesday warned Russia against wrecking an almost completed deal on bringing the United States and Iran back into compliance with the 2015 accord. Iran's top negotiator returned to Vienna on Wednesday from consultations in Tehran. Russia's envoy to the talks, Mikhail Ulyanov, dismissed any suggestion Moscow was holding up an agreement and said a final text had in any case not been completed. Eleven months of talks to restore the deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme, have reached their final stages with several diplomats saying there was broad agreement. But just as the final issues were being resolved, Russia presented a new obstacle by demanding written guarantees from the United States that Western sanctions targeting Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine would not affect its trade with Iran. Ulyanov said Moscow's demands had not received a positive reaction. ""In view of the new circumstances and wave of sanctions against Russia we have the right to protect our interests in the nuclear field and wider context,"" Ulyanov said. He said the United States and the European Union had to make it clear that neither now or in the future sanctions could hit the implementation of nuclear projects in Iran as well as its trade and economic relations. Ulyanov met the coordinator of the talks, Enrique Mora of the European Union, on Tuesday evening and again on Wednesday. He said he would still have to report back to Moscow for a final decision after the text was finalised. ""There is no final text so how can our position delay anything if final negotiations are not finished,"" he said. ""A number of participants at this moment are not ready to confirm that the text is fully acceptable to them."" U.S. NOT PLAYING U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland on Tuesday accused Russia of seeking to reap extra benefits from its participation in the effort to restore the nuclear agreement, but she said Washington would not be playing ""Let's Make a Deal."" Two Western diplomats said it was still not clear what the exact nature of Moscow's demands were, while a European diplomat said Russia was demanding sweeping guarantees on trade between Moscow and Tehran, demands that were deemed unacceptable. They said the talks were now not likely to end this week. Mora broke off informal meetings on Monday saying the time had come for political decisions to be taken to end the negotiations. European negotiators from France, Britain, and Germany had already temporarily left the talks as they believed they had gone as far as they could go and it was now up to the United States and Iran to agree on outstanding issues. Iran's chief negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, returned to Tehran unexpectedly after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov outlined Moscow's new demands. Iran's foreign minister said at the time that Tehran would not let its interests be harmed by ""foreign elements"".
