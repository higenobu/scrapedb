1/17/2022,"Parents who offer to donate air filters that limit Covid transmission in their children’s classrooms are being turned down by some schools, say parents’ groups. As headteachers report disruption caused by soaring staff absences, parents are buying high efficiency particulate air (Hepa) filters to supplement the 7,000 additional units that will be offered to schools in England by the Department for Education (DfE).  While some heads have accepted parents’ donations, others are prioritising cleaning regimes and opening windows, as official guidance does not specify the need for air filters and recommends schools use their own risk assessments. Sarah Saul, the co-founder of parents group SafeEdforAll, said some schools were rejecting the free filters because of insufficient government guidance. She said: “I’ve encountered tens of schools which are forgoing layers of mitigation – including filters and ventilation improvements – because they have been poorly explained and are not mandated by the government. Rejecting free donations just doesn’t make any sense to us. We’re not blaming school leaders, we’re blaming the guidance that they’re trying to follow, wrongly.” Gemma Sewell, the co-founder of Parents United UK, said: “More often, we see schools turning them down. One of the most common excuses is ‘if we accept it for your child’s classroom, that’s inequitable, because we can’t afford to install them in all our classrooms’.” Karen Cudmore, from Kent, said she had offered to buy her children’s secondary schools CO2 monitors and Hepa filters after her 14-year-old daughter contracted long Covid early last year. “Both schools have said this isn’t part of government guidance and my children can continue to just wear masks if that makes them feel safe.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is very kind of parents to offer to pay for air filters and we understand their concerns. But schools may understandably want to identify where the units are needed and then apply for the equipment that is being provided through the government scheme in the first instance.” To qualify for a government air purifier, schools must show they have consistently poor CO2 levels. But, according to research by NASUWT, the teachers’ union, more than half of UK teachers (56%) do not have access to a CO2 monitor in their classroom. One parent from Suffolk took her daughter out of lessons because of fears of rising infection among other children, after the headteacher rejected her Hepa donation. She said the academy trust had no plans to install filters. Demands are growing for the DfE to fund units for all schools, amid discontent at leaving windows open during winter. Patrick Roach, the NASUWT general secretary, said: “Efforts to ensure good ventilation in the fight against Covid should not be a lottery for schools. They should be guaranteed the necessary equipment, rather than being offered a chance to bid for an air purifier.” The DfE said: “Air cleaning units are not needed in the vast majority of classrooms – only where there is poor ventilation that cannot be easily improved. Based on feedback from schools that there are only a small number of cases where good ventilation is not possible, we are supplying up to 8,000 air cleaning units from this week.”",News/Education,"Schools rejecting offers of air filters that limit Covid spread, say parents",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/17/schools-rejecting-offers-to-buy-air-filters-that-limit-covid-parents-say
1/17/2022,"Good morning. Two teenagers have been arrested in Manchester, north-west England, after the FBI said an armed British man travelled to Texas and took four hostages at a synagogue in what President Joe Biden called “an act of terror”.  Last night, UK counter-terrorism police said the pair, whose ages and genders they did not immediately confirm, had been arrested in the south of the city as part of the investigation into the attack and remained in custody for questioning. Earlier, Biden condemned a tense 11-hour hostage standoff at the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in the Dallas suburb of Colleyville on Saturday evening, as the FBI named the armed assailant as Malik Faisal Akram, a 44-year-old British national. Did any of the hostages die? No. All four hostages survived the siege and were unharmed, according to local police. What about Akram? He was pronounced dead after the FBI stormed the building. Where is he from? UK security sources confirmed to the Guardian that the suspect had been a resident of Blackburn in Lancashire. This was later confirmed in a statement by Greater Manchester police. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, says Novak Djokovic was deported because he tried to breach entry rules at the border, even though the immigration minister did not dispute the tennis player’s belief he had a valid medical exemption. The Serbian tennis star boarded an Emirates flight from Melbourne to Dubai last night, hours after the full federal court upheld the minister’s decision to cancel Djokovic’s visa. Morrison said today the world men’s No 1 had failed to comply with “the rules”, that to enter Australia “you either have to be vaccinated or you have to have a valid medical exemption and show evidence of it”. “It’s as simple as that,” the prime minister told 2GB radio. “This is about someone who sought to come to Australia and not comply with the entry rules at our border. That’s what this is about.” What has Djokovic said? In a statement yesterday, he said he was “extremely disappointed” with the ruling but respected it and would “cooperate with the relevant authorities in relation to my departure from the country”. It seemed that Biden would be bad for business in “make America great again” world. In theory, the US president, a white man with working-class roots and moderate policy positions, was a more elusive target for Donald Trump’s increasingly extreme support base than other prominent Democrats. But after his first year in office, it transpires that Biden is not too boring to be a rightwing boogeyman after all. “He’s our best salesperson,” said Ronald Solomon, a merchandiser who sells a $21.99 T-shirt depicting the president with an Adolf Hitler-style mustache and the slogan “Not My Dictator”. “Sales for Trump stuff and anti-Biden merchandise is the highest it’s been except for the three months leading up to the 2020 election.” The demonization of Biden as a Hitler, Stalin or anti-white racist bears no relation to reality. But for many Republican voters it appears to stick, the product of relentless conservative media attacks, the president’s own missteps, and seething frustration during a seemingly neverending pandemic. Is the Republican formula working? John Zogby, a pollster and author, said: “They have made significant inroads into demonizing him … But definitely in the second half of this first year, the almost-mantras of the Republican party have gained hold: he’s too old, he’s a socialist, and then this whole ‘Let’s go, Brandon’ thing. The Duke of Sussex believes the UK is too dangerous for him and his family to visit without state protection, as it emerged he is taking legal action against the government to allow him to pay privately for police security while in Britain. Depicting a rainswept Paris street, the fate of a Nazi-looted painting by the impressionist Camille Pissarro is now in the hands of the highest court in the US, in a case that has long pitted one of Madrid’s top art museums against the heirs of Jewish refugees. Australia’s minister for the Pacific, Zed Seselja, says initial reports suggest no mass casualties in Tonga after the eruption of a volcano that triggered a tsunami, but Australian police have visited beaches with significant damage and “houses thrown around”. Leaders in the US have struck a pessimistic tone about the Covid-19 pandemic in recent weeks amid rapid spread of the Omicron variant. Here experts explain whether getting Covid is inevitable and why, despite claims of “mildness”, the variant is highly dangerous. More than one in 10 fish oil supplements tested from among 60 large retail brands are rancid, while nearly half are just under the recommended maximum limit, according to independent tests. Conducted over several years by Labdoor, which analyses vitamins and supplements based on criteria such as purity, label accuracy and nutritional value, the tests measured common US-branded fish oils, available globally, against international voluntary standards of rancidity. For nine years, the New York Times journalist Andrea Elliott followed the fortunes of one family living in poverty. In this extract from her new book, Invisible Child, we meet Dasani Coates in 2012, aged 11 and living in a shelter. She belongs to an invisible tribe of more than 22,000 homeless children – the highest number ever recorded, in the most unequal metropolis in America. Almost half of New York’s 8.3 million residents are living near or below the poverty line. Perhaps because toxic chemical pollution isn’t that obvious, it is often overlooked. So while public awareness of single-use plastic waste has soared in recent years – all of those bottles, straws and carrier bags are tangible symptoms of our disposable mindset and overconsumption – there’s much more to the story. After tests revealed the levels of harmful chemicals in her blood, Anna Turns, an environmental writer, vowed to discover the best ways to keep her family safe. The climate crisis is damaging the health of foetuses, babies and infants across the world, six studies have found. Scientists discovered increased heat was linked to fast weight gain in babies, which increases the risk of obesity in later life. Higher temperatures were also linked to premature birth, which can have lifelong health effects, and to increased hospital admissions of young children. Other studies found exposure to smoke from wildfires doubled the risk of a severe birth defects. An artist has accused Lego of recreating a leather jacket he made for Queer Eye cast-member Antoni Porowski without the artist’s permission, claiming that a toy jacket included in a Lego set based on the Netflix show is a “blatant copy” of his design.

1/17/2022,"Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London who was suspended from Labour over comments about Hitler supporting Zionism, has said he will apply to join the Green party. Describing himself as “both green and red”, he told the Guardian: “I genuinely think we’re heading toward extinction before the end of the century because no government anywhere is doing enough to tackle the impact of climate change.  “At Cop26 they all said the right things but … you’ve got to get people to completely change the way we live and no government around the world seems to have the courage to do that.” During his time in office, the 76-year-old once known as “Red Ken” launched environmental measures such as the congestion charge. He also founded the C40 group of mayors for cutting emissions, which was backed by figures such as Bill Clinton, Al Gore and the then UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres. But Livingstone was a polarising and controversial figure, leaving the Labour party after he was suspended in May 2016 for telling a journalist that when Hitler was first elected, “he was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing 6 million Jews”. Livingstone said he was alluding to the contentious 1933 Haavara agreement between Nazi Germany and some Zionist groups. The Haavara deal undermined an attempted Jewish boycott of Nazi Germany, but enabled about 60,000 Jews to migrate to Israel, if they used their assets to purchase exported German goods. To critics, though, his words trivialised the genocide, confused its agency – which belongs solely to Hitler – unfairly linked Zionism and nazism and even offered Hitler a “diminished responsibility” defence. Zack Polanski, a Green party London assembly member, said: “The rules are very clear that there’s no space in the party for antisemitism, transphobia, racism, sexism or any other form of discrimination and while it wouldn’t be appropriate to comment on any individual application, I’d expect any new member – whoever they are – to follow our code of conduct.” Membership applications from high-profile political defectors first have to go to a Green regional council for an internal consultation process. Asked whether they would accept Livingstone as a member, a party spokesperson said: “We welcome everybody who shares our political aims and values to join the Green party.” Livingstone still denies having misspoken on Zionism but added that “if I’d known it was all going to be distorted like this, I would of course have done a much longer, boring analysis about the history”. He first put out feelers to the Greens in talks with several senior members that covered “how much I wanted to join and what I’d do”, he said, “but they never got back to me”. His initial suspicion had been that they “thought that if they brought me in they’d be accused of being antisemitic”, he said. His message to the party now, though, was straightforward: “Have me in!” he said. “I never met anyone in the Green party I didn’t like. I will apply to join them [the Greens].” Issues such as air pollution controls, bike lanes and green job guarantees for rust-belt workers were ripe for campaigning work, he said. “I would like to see a Green-Labour coalition run the country,” he said. But he advised socialists to stay in the Labour party to help build such an alliance, which has some precedents. In 2008, the Greens called for their supporters to transfer their second votes to Livingstone in the mayoral vote eventually won by Boris Johnson. The Green peer Jenny Jones, Livingstone’s former deputy, was more effusive. Ken was “incredibly green”, she said and “understood the climate emergency”. She added that she had seen no evidence of antisemitism by him in eight years of working together. “As far as I’m concerned, I would welcome him,” she said. “He was a superb mayor and he was followed by Boris Johnson, who doesn’t understand the environment and is obsessed by economic growth.” While maintaining that Keir Starmer “will be the best prime minister since Clement Attlee”, Livingstone did not rule out a run for mayor as a Green candidate. “I will be 78 or 79 by the time of the next mayoral election and I don’t think people will be rushing to vote for someone that old,” he said. “But I would love to do it.”",News/Politics,Former London mayor Ken Livingstone ‘will apply’ to join Greens,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/17/former-london-mayor-ken-livingstone-will-apply-to-join-greens
1/17/2022,"Apotent memory from one of the more unedifying periods of my life: regularly working late enough to find myself too exhausted or disinclined to cook, completing my commute with minutes to spare before the nearest shop within any reasonable distance closed, and traipsing up and down the aisles, attempting to coax out of hiding – or else will into existence – something more appetising than a microwaveable meal. Usually, this performance ended in succumbing to the most yellow-stickered curry. Sometimes, though, I would refuse this miserable end. I would stoically scour the remaining available takeaway options across the delivery apps and drop more than is advisable on a meal. It would invariably arrive lukewarm after midnight; I’d feel too tired to stay awake, but also completely unable to sleep. Then my alarm for the following morning would sound and I would begin this sordid little ritual all over again.  I was recently transported back to that time by an advert. An Uber Eats rider stands in a harshly illuminated corridor, holding aloft a bag apparently containing a delivery of Subway sandwiches. A slogan reads “When your day is long, go Footlong”. I stared at it for a while. The clumsy wordplay, the ironic defeatism, the Subway sandwich as the epitome of something only someone completely ground down by their day could believe was a palatable option … Ah, crushing resignation, my old friend. I feel compelled to spend at least £10 on you again. At some point, a significant segment of advertising in the UK and the US started self-consciously aping the sardonic disaffection and dejection that many of us feel about grimly submitting to life under contemporary capitalism. A shoe company predicts a future without retirement and does not offer salvation, but instead footwear suited to perennial toil. An online estate agent mocks the idea of conceiving of a home as anything other than an investment opportunity. A tech company boasts of how its mobile phones facilitate the penetration of work into your every waking hour. A website builder appropriates Dolly Parton’s most famous song to nod to a “5 to 9” culture of working on a myriad of jobs and hustles. What vision of the world is conjured by this kind of advertising? It’s hardly an optimistic one. It’s as though capitalism no longer feels the need to promote itself through advertising – its public face – nor maintain a pretence that it can deliver an appealing or even tolerable way of life for many. Instead, these adverts affect a knowing posture, as if they, too, share our dissatisfactions with the modern world, all the while heavily implying its conditions are as inevitable as drizzle in British summer time. The Uber Eats ads are likely very effective; plastered all over public transport, where dog-tired commuters will be most suggestible to the charms of a sugar-crash-inducing 12-inch meatball marinara. A quick audit of the interiors of the buses, trains and trams that serve Britain’s cities reveals a unifying theme. Alongside Uber Eats’ competitors in the takeaway market (Just Eat, Deliveroo, Getir), a huge amount of the adverts pummelling you on your way into the office seem to be for minimal effort “meal kit” services (Gousto, HelloFresh, Mindful Chef) or else products that replace the need to bother with the faff of a meal entirely (Huel, Soylent). Deprived of the requisite leisure time to cook for pleasure or eat, we must instead find ways of efficiently optimising our sustenance. Perhaps the most miserable thing about the Uber Eats campaign is the way it’s fronted by one of the company’s many employees who aren’t really employees at all. One obvious example of those forced to organise their life around long, late-night hours that are not conducive to eating, are those contractors who make up the gig economy – a realm of the modern labour market in which the widespread use of “self-employment” means workers are deprived of the benefits and stability that everyone deserves. Research published by the TUC estimates that around 4.4 million people (nearly 15% of working adults) perform “platform work” in this insecure sector. That this has more than doubled since 2016 means it’s not particularly difficult to imagine a scenario in which an Uber Eats rider clocks off hungry at a time when their options are limited to relying on another delivery rider to bring them an insubstantial meal. And then that next rider finds themselves in the same position. And so on. There’s something more than a little worrying about an advertising culture that doesn’t even try to delude us into imagining a fantastic future, but instead reflects the grim realities of the present. That said, defeated resignation can be lucrative for the advertisers. It’s in precisely these conditions that the human mind encounters the Subway sandwich at its most desirable – and regards the idea of having one couriered to the front door late at night a prudent financial decision. So, what are we having tonight?

1/17/2022,"The outlook for jobs globally this year has worsened markedly since last spring as new variants of the Covid-19 virus have slowed growth and restricted hiring, according to a report from the International Labour Organisation. In its latest assessment of the state of the labour market, the Geneva-based ILO said unemployment would remain above 2019 levels until at least 2023 and the damage caused by the pandemic would take years to repair.  The ILO said its latest estimates showed there would be the equivalent of 52m fewer jobs globally in 2022 than in the last quarter of 2019, the period immediately before the pandemic struck. That represents a doubling from the 26m in the organisation’s last labour market update in May 2021. According to the report, global unemployment will be 207m, a smaller drop from the 214m in 2021 than previously expected and well above the 186m reported in 2019. The ILO said the impact of the pandemic on employment was “significantly” greater than the raw figures suggested, because many people had left the labour force entirely. The global labour force participation rate, the number of people in work or seeking employment, was forecast to be 59.3% in 2022 – 1.2 percentage points below that of 2019, it added. The ILO director-general, Guy Ryder, said: “Two years into this crisis, the outlook remains fragile and the path to recovery is slow and uncertain. “We are already seeing potentially lasting damage to labour markets, along with concerning increases in poverty and inequality. Many workers are being required to shift to new types of work – for example in response to the prolonged slump in international travel and tourism. “There can be no real recovery from this pandemic without a broad-based labour market recovery. And to be sustainable, this recovery must be based on the principles of decent work – including health and safety, equity, social protection and social dialogue.” The ILO said the Delta and Omicron variants had been partly responsible for the downgrades to its 2022 forecasts, noting there was significant uncertainty about the future course of the pandemic. Labour market recovery was fastest in high-income countries, where a higher proportion of populations have been vaccinated. The ILO said the most developed nations accounted for about half of the global decline in unemployment between 2020 and 2022 while constituting only about a fifth of the global labour force. Lower-middle-income countries had fared the worst during the pandemic.",News/Society,"Covid variants have led to worse global unemployment, says ILO",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/17/covid-variants-leading-to-worse-global-unemployment-says-ilo
1/17/2022,"Novelty comes annually to wine, the release of each new vintage bringing, in effect, the release of a new product every year. It means no winemaker can release the same wine two years in succession, even if they wanted to. No matter how obsessively they might try to control all the other variables (same vines, same tanks, same yeasts, same winemaker, same bottle, same label), the year’s weather will always have its say. Of course, the release of some new vintages is more anticipated than others. Right now, in London, the top end of the Burgundy wine trade is showing off the soon-to-be-released wines of the region’s 2020 vintage, which, by all insider accounts I’ve heard, has brought some beautiful wines into the world, as indeed it seems to have done all over France.  The 2020 wines will feel all the more precious given the viticultural disaster that was 2021 not just in France but across Europe, where late spring frosts, hail and, further south, forest fires, among other Biblical factors, combined to bring the smallest European vintage in 30 years. When I visited the Loire back in November, I came across the sorry sight of empty barrels everywhere, inevitable when producers were facing the loss of up to 80% of their annual crop. The cycle of vintages isn’t the only source of the new in wine. The frenzy of planting and site-discovery that was such a feature of the previous half century in wine outside Europe – when countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Chile and the USA were establishing themselves as peers to France and Italy – may have calmed. Exciting new vineyards are still emerging all over the so-called New World, whether it’s the tiny but extraordinarily promising Place of Changing Winds in the Macedon Ranges region of Victoria in Australia, or the Domaines Barons de Rothschild’s attempt to make a Chinese answer to Château Lafite in the Qiu Shan valley of Shandong province. In Europe, much of what I think of as new is really a return to the old. Many of the most exciting “new” wines I tasted last year, for example, came from winemakers working rediscovered very old vineyards in places such as the Gredos mountains near Madrid or Mt Etna in Sicily, while others are the result of British merchants’ rediscovery of the joys of eastern European wine culture, from Slovenia and Croatia, to Bulgaria and Romania. In the same spirit, the use of the original, ancient winemaking vessel, the clay amphora, has become increasingly widely – and deftly – used, while one of the styles associated with these clay pots – wines made from white grapes that have spent so long macerating with their skins the colour has turned orange – has made ever deeper progress into the mainstream. Much to the annoyance of the small-scale producers responsible for the style’s development, the mass-produced “orange” wine, often made in somewhat more industrial stainless steel tanks rather than amphorae, is one of the biggest of wine’s new old things. Rigal Vin OrangeVin de France (£10, Morrisons)One of the best of the new supermarket breed of high-production orange wines, this southern French effort is made using the tangy Gascon gros manseng grape. The extra time in contact with the skins brings an intense nutty-herbal twang and touch of chewy texture to the exotic fruit. Kvalitetno Vino Croatica GrasevinaCroatia 2020 (£9.95, tanners-wines.co.uk)There’s nothing “new” about Croatian wines, but there has been a change of attitude towards them among British wine importers. That’s good news for fans of juicy, fresh, aromatically vivacious white wines such as this, made from the grasevina grape (AKA welsch riesling). Cave de Lugny Chardonnay Mâcon-VillagesBurgundy, France 2020 (£11.95, Waitrose)Burgundy’s smartest domaines are only just revealing the quality of their 2020s. There are already numerous examples of this vintage out in the wild from bigger producers, with this white showing bountiful ripe rounded fruitiness, honey and luminous brightness. COS Pithos Rosso di VittoriaSicily, Italy 2019 (from £24.10, hedonism.co.uk; lescaves.co.uk; josephbarneswines.com)A blend of Sicilian local varieties frappato and nero d’avola, this wine is from a small biodynamic producer in southeastern Sicily. Its distinctive sweet-savoury-sour-cherry-plum forms a seductive argument for using terracotta amphorae to make red wine. Château le Roc Roc’Ambulle Pet Nat NegretteFronton, France 2020 (from £15.40, montywines.co.uk; forestwines.com)Another very old winemaking method enjoying a modern renaissance, pet nat sparklers are made by bottling the wine before it’s finished fermenting, with the CO2 remaining in the bottle. This is a lovely, lively example from vineyards near Toulouse, all sweetly easy-drinking cherry-berry fun. BEST BUY4 Monos GR10, Vinos de Madrid, Spain 2018 (£12.67, justerinis.com)A brilliant entry point for the delicately beautiful infusions of sun-baked hillside herbs, warm earth and red fruit that are the very old vine garnacha-based wines of the Gredos mountains near Madrid.

1/17/2022,"“Language, religion, music and storytelling all form part of the migrant’s cultural toolbox, but perhaps nothing provides more of a sense of identity than food.” This is a line from the introduction of Yasmin Khan’s travelogue-cookbook Ripe Figs, which charts her travels through Greece, Cyprus and Turkey, and is underpinned by the experience of her family’s migration from Kashmir to Punjab, Gilan in Iran to London. Also open on my desk here in the corner of the kitchen is Paola Bacchia’s Istria, which uses recipes to tell the story of her parents’ emigration from Istria and Italy to Melbourne in the 1950s, alongside stories of her own return visits. These were two of my favourite cookbooks last year, both to read and to cook from. They are different, approaching distinct circumstances in different ways. Khan is bold in her retelling of journeys undertaken for protection and safety, to flee political, economic and social turmoil, and also challenges how certain journeys are seen as problematic. Bacchia, meanwhile, keeps her focus closely on her own family and the daily act of cooking, although within that are powerful hints as to the complex history and politics of the Croatian-Slovenian-Italian-Istrian peninsula, and the dramatic exodus and loss.  What the two books share is love; and how food accompanies people on journeys, how it provides comfort and a way of maintaining a sense of identity, especially as that evolves in a new place. For both authors, food answers the question: where do we come from and what do we believe? For Bacchia, the answers come in the form of Venetian fish stews with polenta, desserts you might find in a Viennese coffee shop, Hungarian-style goulash, sauerkraut and pasta dishes with both Italian and Croatian names. Today’s recipe, now on regular rotation here, is hers: gulash di funghi e peperoni. Mushrooms and peppers are a compatible couple in terms of flavour and also nature. Despite their different textures, they behave similarly in the pan, first giving off liquid, then reabsorbing the collective liquid and becoming almost velvety in the process. They both benefit from some hot paprika, too, which fires up the sweet pepper and mushroom’s earthy flavour. While the version without cream is lovely, its addition not only brings everything together, it takes the dish into a luxurious dimension. While it is full of flavour and fairly rich, it doesn’t weigh heavy. Bacchia suggests serving it with polenta or mashed potatoes; I imagine boiled potatoes would be good, too, or spätzle or another egg pasta. As you can see from the photograph, and in keeping with the idea, recipes may change as they arrive in new kitchens. We had it with rice. Serves 4 15g dried porcini1kg field mushrooms2 red peppers, or 1 large jar roast peppers1 large onion, peeled and sliced4 tbsp olive oil20g butterSalt2 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced150ml dry white wine150g tomato passata, or 1 heaped tbsp tomato concentrate dissolved in 140ml warm waterA few sprigs of thyme2 tsp sweet paprika½ tsp hot, smoked paprika1-2 tbsp red-wine vinegar200ml single cream, to serve (optional) Soak the porcini in 150ml warm water for 15 minutes. Lift out, chop and set aside, along with the soaking liquid. Wipe clean the field mushrooms and cut into 7mm-thick slices, which for an average mushroom means into three. Cut the peppers into four, remove the seeds and pith, then cut each quarter into 3mm-wide strips. (If using jarred peppers, cut them into thick strips.) Set a large, heavy-based pan for which you have a lid over a medium-low heat, add the olive oil and butter, then stir in the onions and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, for about 10 minutes, until soft and translucent. Stir in the garlic and cook for a minute more. Add the reconstituted and the fresh mushrooms, raise the heat and cook, stirring, for a few minutes, until the mushrooms start shrinking. Add the peppers and cook, stirring for a few minutes more. (If you are using jarred ones, wait.) Add the wine, passata, thyme and the porcini liquid with all the paprika stirred into it first. Bring to a boil, then cover, turn the heat down low and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove the lid and, if you are using jarred peppers, add them now. Continue cooking uncovered for at least 15 minutes, while tasting and watching. If you are adding cream, you want most of the liquid evaporated; if not, you need something more brothy. Either way, once cooked, taste, adjust with salt, more paprika and a tablespoon or two of red-wine vinegar. If you are adding it, stir in 200ml single cream just before serving.

1/17/2022,"Every year, on the third Monday in January, America hosts a Sadie Hawkins-style role-reversal where the entire country pretends to celebrate a man whose achievements and values they spent the previous 364 days ignoring, demonizing and trying to dismantle. Today, your favorite vote suppressors will take a brief respite from disenfranchising Black voters, denying history and increasing inequality to celebrate a real American hero. That’s right, it’s MLK Day!  You might think it’s a little disrespectful to refer to a great American hero by his initials but, in this specific case, it’s perfectly fine. The actual Martin Luther King Jr who lived and breathed is not the man most people will be honoring today because that Martin Luther King is dead and gone. No, the man upon whom they will heap their performative praise with social media virtue-signaling is MLK, a caricature of a man whose likeness has been made palatable for white consumption. Like BLM, CRT and USA, the people who King fought against have now managed to flatten a three-dimensional symbol to a three-letter, chant-worthy phrase worthy of demonization or deification. I am not condemning this all-American tradition of gaslighting. I had an imaginary friend growing up and he was not nearly as eloquent as this history – refurbished MLK they have invented. I, more than anyone, can appreciate the effort this country has put into manufacturing a version of King that is based on a true story. Whitewashing an entire human being is not as easy as you think. Plus, I understand why they do it: The real Martin Luther King would make white people uncomfortable. Anyone who knows the unwhitened story of Martin Luther King Jr understands why whitesplaining “what MLK would have wanted” is a favorite pastime of politicians and performative sympathetic social media “allies”. The average American might get the heebie-jeebies if they knew they were celebrating a radical who challenged systemic racism, supported reparations and advocated for a universal basic income. Although, in death, he became one of the most revered figures in US history, for the entirety of the 39 years that King lived and breathed, there wasn’t a single day when the majority of white Americans approved of him. In 1966, Gallup measured his approval rating at 32% positive and 63% negative. That same year, a December Harris poll found that 50% of whites felt King was “hurting the negro cause of civil rights” while only 36% felt he was helping. By the time he died in 1968, three out of four white Americans disapproved of him. In the wake of his assassination, 31% of the country felt that he “brought it on himself”. One does not have to reach back into the historical archives to explain why King was so despised. The sentiments that made him a villain are still prevalent in America today. When he was alive, King was a walking, talking example of everything this country despises about the quest for Black liberation. He railed against police brutality. He reminded the country of its racist past. He scolded the powers that be for income inequality and systemic racism. Not only did he condemn the openly racist opponents of equality, he reminded the legions of whites who were willing to sit idly by while their fellow countrymen were oppressed that they were also oppressors. “He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it,” King said. “He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.” To be fair, King readily admitted that it was his goal to make white people uncomfortable. Just before he condemned white moderates in A Letter from Birmingham Jail, he revealed that his goal was to “create the kind of tension in society that will help men to rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism”. He went on to explain that nonviolent direct action – King’s primary strategy to affect progress – was an attempt to induce the white community to a point where marginalized people’s desperate cries could no longer be ignored. Yet, this new, more compassionate America is just as intolerant when Black Lives Matter demonstrators flood into the streets to protest police brutality. Of course, if teaching Black history wasn’t criminalized as critical race theory, more people might know that the Selma-to-Montgomery marchers’ original intent was to confront their governor about police brutality – namely the murder of Jimmie Lee Jackson by an Alabama state trooper. The people who believe the NFL should have kicked Colin Kaepernick out of football for his “un-American” protests would have really loathed Roberto Clemente, who convinced his teammates to protest King’s death by refusing to play on Major League Baseball’s opening day in 1968. They were furious when Clemente told his local paper: “If you have to ask Negro players, then we do not have a great country.” I wonder how Tim Scott and Mitch McConnell would’ve felt about that. After all, they both invoked King’s name while claiming that America is not a racist country. But I’m sure MLK would never go as far as painting his place of birth as a racist country. “The first thing I would like to mention is that there must be a recognition on the part of everybody in this nation that America is still a racist country,” said King days before a white supremacist put a bullet in his face. “Now however unpleasant that sounds, it is the truth. And we will never solve the problem of racism until there is a recognition of the fact that racism still stands at the center of so much of our nation and we must see racism for what it is.” See how many times someone mentions that quote today. Oh, wait … King made that speech at Grosse Pointe High School, where Michigan’s Republican-controlled House of Representatives recently passed an anti-CRT bill making it illegal to teach that the “United States is a fundamentally racist country”. Never mind. That’s why, despite what people who cherry-pick quotes from the I Have a Dream speech would have you believe, King has never suggested that white people should be judged “by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin”. In fact, he regularly judged white people to explain the insanity of white supremacy. “In their relations with Negroes, white people discovered that they had rejected the very center of their own ethical professions,” King wrote in 1956. “They could not face the triumph of their lesser instincts and simultaneously have peace within. And so, to gain it, they rationalized – insisting that the unfortunate Negro, being less than human, deserved and even enjoyed second class status… White men soon came to forget that the Southern social culture and all its institutions had been organized to perpetuate this rationalization. They observed a caste system and quickly were conditioned to believe that its social results, which they had created, actually reflected the Negro’s innate and true nature.” Even as a 17-year-old, King used Georgia’s largest newspaper to make the entire state uncomfortable when he reminded the Atlanta Constitution’s readers: “It is fair to remember that almost the total of race mixture in America has come, not at Negro initiative, but by the acts of those very white men who talk loudest of race purity.” To white America, that Martin Luther King Jr was an America-hating, anti-white commie, just like today’s outspoken Black people who are criticized for “playing” all the things that white America hates: the “race card”, the “victim”, and – my favorite – “identity politics”. But, now that King is dead and gone, leaders like Ted Cruz and Ron DeSantis will sing hosannas for MLK while demonizing Black Lives Matter and critical race theory as Marxist, un-American race-baiting that poses American values. It is no coincidence that Alabama’s governor George Wallace described King as “perhaps the most dangerous racist in America today. Long before “race-baiting” became a popular term, South Carolina senator Strom Thurmond said King “must always have an agitation objective lest he end up in the street one day without a drum to beat or a headline to make”. One of Thurmond’s first acts after leaving the Democratic party to become a Republican was to implore the FBI to investigate King’s activities as a communist. (Years later, Thurmond voted for the MLK holiday.) Even after his death, conservative leaders sought to sully King’s legacy by erasing the prospect of a holiday honoring him. “Rev. King’s motives are misrepresented,” wrote then Ohio senator John Ashbrook. “He sought not to work through the law but around it.” And they won. They only agreed to honor King’s legacy after enough time had passed to sufficiently whitewash the radical who unapologetically fought for liberty and justice for all. This might be why they contend that he “gave his life” for civil rights – as if he agreed to take a projectile from a high-powered rifle to his temple in exchange for a statue, a church fan with his face on it, and a three-day weekend in the future. But, let not your heart be troubled when you hear them shower the memory of Martin Luther King Jr with bouquets of reverence. The people who continue to protect broken systems of criminal justice, education and democracy might not necessarily hate King but they do not love him or anything he stood for. That’s not even an opinion. The polling data proves it. Historical facts prove it. The bits of blood and bone that stained the balcony outside of a Memphis hotel proves it. More importantly, the fact that Black Americans are still fighting the same battles against voter suppression, inequality and the right to have a dream almost 54 years after his death is the most accurate measuring rod of what this nation thinks about Martin Luther King. Perhaps that is the most uncomfortable fact of all.

1/17/2022,"Chinese authorities are urging citizens not to order goods from overseas, in the latest extreme measure aimed at curbing Covid outbreaks only weeks away from the biggest holiday of the year and the start of the Beijing Winter Olympics. The advisory on overseas packages was issued after authorities claimed that a recent Omicron infection detected in Beijing came from an international package sent from Canada.  China is committed to its policy of zero Covid, but there is also pressure to allow some celebrations during the upcoming lunar new year festivities, typically the biggest travel period of the year. At the same time there is an urgency to keep the virus out of Beijing, which hosts the Winter Olympics in a few weeks. The Communist party government has pledged the Games will go ahead safely, albeit without overseas general spectators. In his new year address, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, said “we will spare no effort to present a great Games to the world”, but the growing outbreaks have threatened the pledge. Officials are under pressure to stamp out infections, and many having been punished for apparent failures. Different measures have been imposed across different provinces and cities, of varying degrees of severity. Health authorities on Monday reported 223 cases from the previous 24 hours to midnight, including 163 local transmissions. The majority were in Tianjin, where 79 of its 80 cases were found in Jinnan district, and 68 in Henan province, of which 60 were in the locked down city of Anyang. One case reported in the southern city of Shenzhen, bordering Hong Kong, was confirmed as Omicron. Most of the infections so far have been detected in Tianjin – where China’s first case of Omicron was found in 9 December. However, the discovery of a lone Omicron case in Beijing over the weekend has sparked renewed alarm. At a press conference on Monday, officials said tracing had determined the infection came not from another province, but from a package sent from Toronto, via the US and Hong Kong. Liao Linzhu, the deputy director of the city’s post administration, urged people “to not buy products from oversea areas”. Authorities said the patient diagnosed with the Omicron variant on Saturday had “self-reported” that they had received a package on 11 January. The package had been sent four days earlier. Authorities have since quarantined the patient’s family, the courier, and more than 60 others as close contacts, and tested more than 16,000 people in the patient’s home district of Haidian. “Omicron virus transmits fast, please pay attention, avoid buying stuff from overseas, make sure you wear gloves, don’t bring the package indoors. If you have to, clean the package outside with alcohol, and wash your hands,” said Pang Xinghuo, the deputy director of Beijing’s health authority. China has claimed that numerous Covid infections throughout the pandemic have resulted from imported products – often cold chain items – but experts say the scientific basis for the claims is weak. Dr Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland, said it was “a long bow to draw”, and urging people to clean packages and avoid receiving mail was “a wasted effort”. He said the overwhelmingly likely source of the infection was another person, and blaming packaging seemed more political than scientific. “We all know this virus can hang around in people who aren’t showing symptoms, especially early on in the disease,” he said. “If you’re looking for a reason for … a virus being introduced into a jurisdiction, the first thing you’d think of is humans coming in from overseas – where the virus is everywhere. “It’s an airborne virus. It’s not about surfaces. Technically, it can happen, sure. There’s a non-zero risk, sure. But is it happening again and again? No,” he said. “If you see and hear horses, don’t think zebras.” Response measures to the scattered outbreaks are varied and ad-hoc across the affected provinces. Local officials face conflicting pressures: they are largely responsible for implementation and face punishment over perceived or actual failures to control outbreaks. Beijing has introduced a requirement for all new arrivals to the city to obtain a negative Covid test within 48 hours before arriving in the city, and another within 72 hours after. It has also closed some temples and recreation sites, according to state media. Olympics personnel will enter a closed-loop system of accommodation and travel, but with people coming in from all over the world, the chance of imported infections is likely, said Mackay. In Zhuhai city, authorities have ordered residents to undergo three rounds of testing, with their electronic health codes – which dictate freedom of movement – restricted until all are completed. All tourist attractions have been closed, all restaurants in Xiangzhou district have cancelled dine-in, and all flights to Beijing cancelled. In Anyang, further residential areas have been locked down, with authorities planning to deliver food. The central city of Luoyang and southern city of Jieyang have both decreed travellers must report to employers, communities or accommodation three days prior to arrival. Cities including Beijing and Shanghai have ordered or strongly urged people not to travel for the lunar new year festivities. It is the only time many migrant workers in China are able to return to their home villages. In a video widely shared on social media, an older man told onlookers that he and co-workers from a Zhengzhou construction site in Henan province had been forced to stop work, but their home towns had entry restrictions and he had been left homeless. “Last night I slept under the South Third Ring Bridge. Not just me, a dozen people [also slept there]. We are all labourers. We are used to work now, and we don’t feel so cold. The key thing is that we can’t go home and we are anxious about it.” Additional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu",News/World news,"Don’t buy from abroad, Chinese told as Covid threatens Olympics and holidays",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/dont-buy-from-abroad-chinese-told-as-covid-threatens-olympics-and-holidays
1/17/2022,"The upcoming sixth series of blockbuster BBC drama Peaky Blinders will be the last but a new dance-theatre production written by the show’s creator Steven Knight is to retell the Birmingham gangster saga on stage. Peaky Blinders: The Redemption of Thomas Shelby, announced on Monday, will open this autumn at Birmingham Hippodrome then tour in 2023. It is a collaboration with Rambert dance company and will feature a cast of 20 and a live band playing specially commissioned music.  The French choreographer Benoit Swan Pouffer, who was announced as Rambert’s new artistic director in 2018, will stage what he describes as an “inspiring and uplifting” production. The stage show picks up the story of the Peaky Blinders at the end of the first world war and opens in the trenches. It will focus on the romance between Tommy Shelby (played in the TV series by Cillian Murphy) and barmaid-cum-undercover-agent Grace Burgess (played by Annabelle Wallis). Knight said that the series “has always had music and movement at its heart and now the beating heart of the show will be transferred to the stage”. The production “is dance for people who don’t usually watch dance,” he continued. “If the concept of a Peaky Blinders dance seems strange, reserve judgment and reserve a ticket.” Helen Shute, CEO and executive producer of Rambert, said: “We’re incredibly honoured to be trusted by Steven Knight with his nationally beloved Peaky Blinders … We look forward to welcoming a new generation of audiences to theatres with a story that speaks to so many people.” It is not the first time Knight has written for the stage. His play The President of the Empty Room, set in a Cuban cigar factory, ran at the National Theatre in London in 2005. Last year, Knight said that the Peaky Blinders story would continue as a film after the TV series had ended. “My plan from the beginning was to end Peaky with a movie,” he told Deadline. “That is what is going to happen.” Before Rambert’s production opens, a separate stage production hopes to attract the huge fanbase of the TV juggernaut whose fifth series launched to an audience of 6.2 million in 2019. The immersive theatre show Peaky Blinders: The Rise will be staged at the Vanguard theatre in Camden, north London, this summer. It is directed by Tom Maller and designed by Rebecca Brower whose immersive adventure Doctor Who: Time Fracture opened in the summer of 2021.",Arts/Stage,Peaky Blinders: The Redemption of Thomas Shelby stage show to open in Birmingham,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/17/peaky-blinders-the-redemption-of-thomas-shelby-dance-theatre-production-to-open-at-birmingham-hippodrome
1/17/2022,"Surveillance flights have been sent from Australia and New Zealand to assess damage after Tonga was isolated from the rest of the world following a volcanic eruption. Here’s how events have played out over the past few days.  About 4.20am local time (3.10pm GMT on 13 January), the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupts, sending plumes of ash, steam and gas up to 20km into the atmosphere. The undersea volcano is located about 65km (40 miles) north of Tonga’s capital, Nuku’alofa. Though it only rises 114 metres above sea level, the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano overall is 1.8km high and 20km wide. A public notice issued by the Tonga Geological Services notes continuous eruption and a 5km-wide plume. The volcano had been active since an earlier eruption on 20 December but was declared dormant by the authority on 11 January. Volcanic activity in 2014 and 2015 had joined the islands of Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha’apai, which were themselves produced by older volcanic eruptions. A satellite image taken after the eruption shows that the connecting volcanic cone has been largely destroyed. The Tonga Meteorological Services issue a tsunami warning for all islands across the country, with waves of up to 30cm recorded following the eruption. The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupts again at 5.10pm local time on Saturday 15 January. The massive eruption, larger than the one on 14 January, generates an enormous amount of energy and creates an umbrella cloud of ash, spreading the plume concentrically outwards instead of being dispersed in one direction by wind. The initial height of the ash plume is an estimated 15.2km in altitude, later rising up to 30km high. The plume spreads to 260km in diameter before being distorted by wind. The strength of the eruption – as measured by the volcanic explosivity index – is still unknown, as it requires exact figures on how high the plume reaches and the volume of ash ejected. Images from weather satellites, such as this animated video using imagery from a Korean weather satellite, show the dramatic explosion, with ash and water vapour covering an area hundreds of kilometres in diameter: Twenty minutes later, at 5.30pm local time, a 1.2 metre tsunami wave is observed at Nuku’alofa, Tonga’s capital, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Photos and videos emerge on social media of large waves flooding coastal areas, with reports of people making their way inland and to higher ground. Footage shows waves causing damage to buildings and infrastructure such as seawalls. By evening in the Pacific, the volcano is raining ash and “tiny pebbles” on neighbouring Tongan islands, with reports of “darkness blanketing the sky”. Nuku’alofa is reportedly covered in a thick film of volcanic dust. There are concerns about contamination of food and water supplies, as well as acid rain. In addition to preventing aircraft from flying, ash hampers recovery efforts because it “buries gardens and impacts plants with consequences for food supply, and is likely to contaminate water supplies,” volcanologist Dr Chris Firth says. This video of satellite images from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand shows the plume of ash from the eruption enveloping the main island of Tonga, Tongatapu. An air pressure surge from the volcano’s eruption is recorded at seismic stations internationally, including in New Zealand, Australia, the US, and the UK, where two shockwaves are observed. Our atmosphere acts as a fluid, like dropping a pebble in a still pond and seeing the ripples. A UK pressure trace for the past 24 hours shows how our atmosphere continues to see those ripples since the first pressure wave from the #Tonga eruption arrived on Saturday evening. pic.twitter.com/rr0xBONe4v Data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology shows the shockwave travelled faster than 1000km/hr – around three times the speed of sound – and resulted in a noticeable jump in atmospheric pressure. Sonic booms from the eruption were heard across the Pacific, including in Fiji and Vanuatu, and as far as Alaska, more than 9,000km away. Tonga Volcano eruption heard from Lakeba, Fiji 😢🇹🇴 #TongaVolcano pic.twitter.com/qc9ISL25QX In the hours that follow, tsunami warnings are issued across the Pacific, including in New Zealand, Australia, the west coast of the US, and Japan, where around 230,000 people across eight prefectures are ordered to evacuate. Experts believe the tsunami activity could have been triggered either by shock waves propagating through water, or by a landslide on the undersea part of the volcano. Only an estimated 5% of tsunamis have historically resulted from volcanoes, including the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, which caused a devastating tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Krakatoa’s violent eruption was reported to have been heard 4,800km away. Large waves and strong currents are recorded in many coastal areas globally. Images on social media show destruction of coastal homes on several islands in the South Pacific, while Japan’s Pacific coast sees waves of nearly 1.2 metres. Two people drown off a beach in the Lambayeque region of Peru, after unusually high waves are recorded there. The country closes 22 ports as a precaution. The Californian city of Santa Cruz is hit by a tidal surge, damaging boats and resulting in flooding. Australia and New Zealand send planes to Tonga to assess the damage to critical infrastructure such as roads, ports and powerlines. Surveillance flights had been delayed as a result of the ash cloud blanketing Tonga.

1/17/2022,"Jack is a name that pops up in the Genius, the Guardian’s monthly advanced puzzle. Jack is also known as Jason Crampton, who is also known as Skipjack but most often as Serpent – in the Independent, the Inquisitor, Enigmatic Variations and the Listener. Oh, and also in subscription magazine the Magpie, where he is on the editorial team. Let’s meet Serpent. Or Jack. Hello Jack. Has the pandemic generated extra interest for the Magpie magazine, or for tougher puzzles more generally?Absolutely! The number of Magpie subscribers increased last year, as has the number of solutions we receive each month. The number of subscribers to the Cracking the Cryptic YouTube channel – run by Mark Goodliffe and Simon Anthony, who co-founded the Magpie – has grown enormously.  Happy to hear it. Do you have a favourite of your own puzzles?Of my blocked puzzles, perhaps my favourite is the one I wrote following the death of my dog, Bo: every across entry contained his name and the unchecked cells in the central row spelt out GOODBYE. Here’s a review of it (and a link, which might work on some devices). When did you get the crossword bug?I started solving cryptic crosswords at university. I got the setting bug when I attended one of Boatman’s masterclasses. Like others we’ve spoken to here. And how did you choose your pseudonyms?Serpent is a cryptographic algorithm, so it was connected to my day job as a professor of information security. I had intended to choose other cryptographic algorithms if I needed further pseudonyms but then decided that words related to Serpent would be better, hence Basilisk. Skipjack is another cryptographic algorithm, but everyone thought it was a reference to tuna! And Jack is a contraction of Skipjack. Professor, eh? Any other setters you know of in the same echelon?At least a couple: Monk is a professor of mathematics at Leeds University and Sabre – setter of brilliantly fiendish barred puzzles – is also a maths professor, at Arizona State University. Ah, Sabre. My old foe. What makes a successful clue? Or an unsuccessful one?I think successful clues contain at least one of the following: humour, misdirection, oblique definitions and inventive wordplay. An unsuccessful clue contains inaccurate cryptic grammar or definitions. A weak clue uses pedestrian definitions and a list of wordplay instructions that simply have to be followed. We’ve talked here before about how the business of crosswords can involve as much maths as it does literacy. What’s the overlap between your old day job and the puzzles?The wordplay can be thought of as expressions in a formal language, in which wordplay elements represent variables and wordplay indicators represent operators on those variables. I find it very helpful to think of clues in this way when I’m analysing whether the cryptic grammar of a clue is correct. Setting a crossword is a bit like setting an exam: there’s no point in making it too hard or too easy, so there have to be a few entry points. Also, the process of preparing puzzles for publication, especially when one is trying to first get published, has similarities with preparing academic papers for submission. There are many reasons a paper or a crossword can be rejected, so it’s important to give an editor as little as possible to find fault with. Quite. Now, you’re unusual in using the same name in your weekday puzzles as your tricky weekend ones. How do you alter the level of intricacy?Many barred puzzles contain quite obscure words, limiting the possibilities for disguising the definition. Clues for these words often end up as a list of instructions for constructing the answer tacked on to a straightforward definition. I think I’m unusual in also trying to avoid obscure vocabulary in my barred puzzles: I try to populate my grids using a rather limited dictionary. This means I can write clues that are similar to those that I write in blocked puzzles. The disguise in the surfaces – plus any thematic clueing gimmicks – suffice to make the clues difficult enough. What are the tools of your trade?Qxw for grid construction. Crossword Compiler for assembling puzzles in a format acceptable to editors. The Chambers dictionary and thesaurus apps for my phone/tablet. Qat for pattern-matching and searching, which is absolutely essential for barred puzzle construction. Qxw and Qat are both available from Quinapalus’s website. Oxford Dictionary of Quotations and Wikipedia for barred puzzle research. Qat is remarkable. What kind of people do you think are attracted to barred tough puzzles?I think there are people who love crosswords but, after years of practice, find the daily cryptics too easy; they relish the additional challenge of solving puzzles with clueing gimmicks. Others aren’t that interested in daily cryptics but love difficult logical puzzles. For them, it is the endgames of the barred thematic puzzles that are particularly interesting. I’m in the former camp, so my barred puzzles tend to have quite difficult clues but relatively straightforward endgames. Other setters write comparatively straightforward clues but the endgames are extremely intricate and things of real beauty. How do people respond when you tell them that you’re a crossword setter?In pretty much the same way as when I used to say I was a professor in a maths department! “You must be really brainy” or “I could never do maths/solve crosswords”. But they’re also fascinated by it and really interested in how I go about setting them. I try to persuade those who don’t solve crosswords to try them. I tell them they only need a reasonable vocabulary, some patience and an interest in how language can be used in imaginative ways. What’s the future for cryptic crosswords?It’s really difficult to say. I think there will always be a niche market for tough barred puzzles. They will survive in specialist magazines like the Magpie, even if they disappear from the newspapers. There are some brilliant young setters of such puzzles and new ones are always emerging. However, crossword puzzles are relatively expensive to produce compared with puzzles such as sudoku and kakuro, so I could see daily cryptics being viewed as a luxury that newspapers can no longer afford with advertising revenues declining. I hope I’m wrong! But it may be that specialist online crossword sites will emerge that charge subscribers for daily puzzles. I hope there would be enough people willing to pay for puzzles of the quality found in the Guardian and the other broadsheets. Many thanks to Serpent/Jack, whose suggestion for our collaborative playlist Healing Music Recorded in 2020-22 to Accompany a Solve or Even Listen to is from his old schoolfriend Richard March, who “has been involved in recording cover versions of classic songs to raise money for musicians unable to earn a living during the pandemic”.
