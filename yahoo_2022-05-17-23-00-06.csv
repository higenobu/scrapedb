5/17/2022,"When dealing with manipulative or narcissistic people in your life, the best option is to cut contact and leave. But what if that isn't possible? The reality is, not everyone can escape a toxic relationship – especially when it involves co-workers, in-laws or a co-parent. That's why relationship and mental health experts are recommending an alternative in setting boundaries with these people, and it's called the ""gray rock method."" Also known as graywalling or gray rocking, this strategy involves being as disengaged and unresponsive as possible. The goal is to keep your responses limited in order to make the person you are communicating with lose interest in you. ""It's when somebody tries to make themselves as boring and nonreactive as possible to decrease the amount of provoking or emotional reactions,"" says Deborah Ashway, a licensed mental health counselor in North Carolina. ""Because when somebody doesn't give the manipulator the responses they want, they're no longer able to push their buttons."" What is 'hoovering'?: Narcissists often try to win back their exes with ‘hoovering;’ experts say it’s emotional blackmail. Gray rocking is one of many communication techniques when dealing with narcissism and manipulation. Some examples include avoiding eye contact, maintaining a flat tone in your communication, or responding with simple answers like ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""I didn't know that."" Advice column: My ex-wife's petty behavior has caused our son emotional distress. What can I do about it? ""The first step is to visualize yourself as a gray rock,"" says Holly Richmond, a licensed marriage and family therapist. ""You're this immovable, impenetrable force who is disinterested. If they ask you a question, say yes or no and don't give details about your life or admit you're practicing this gray rock method."" Richmond says she recommends gray rocking over yelling or defending yourself, which are likely to provoke the narcissist's damaging behavior. Are you dating a narcissist?: Watch out for these red flags. ""Any kind of attention, even negative, is good for a narcissist and they will take that over no attention at all,"" Richmond says. ""The gray rock method works because it's the most minimal amount you can possibly offer and they'll get bored or lose interest in manipulating you."" However, those who are co-parenting after separation may want to opt for a slight variation of gray rocking called yellow rocking, which involves ""the infusion of a little more emotion in communication,"" according to Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist and author of ""Should I Stay or Should I Go?"" ""You can't be a complete robot in front of your kid, so yellow rocking infuses a bit more emotion into the communication that goes beyond the flatness of gray rocking,"" Durvasula says. ""For example instead of just saying yes, no, you say, 'Oh wow, I didn't know. Thank you so much.'"" 'I felt as if I was dead to her': The psychological cost of the silent treatment While experts say gray rocking is effective in the long-run, it may do more harm than good, and not everyone can stomach it.  ""This method could aggravate them more, because they're not getting the reaction they're used to,"" Ashway warns. ""They may feel their power slipping or their control over you waning, and as a result, they might double down on the manipulation tactics they used to provoke a reaction out of you.""

Don't engage. Don't explain. Don't personalize.

5/17/2022,"The company buying Trump's social network Truth Social warned investors about his past business failures. In a filing Monday, Digital World noted the bankruptcy of Trump Taj Mahal and failure of Trump Vodka. The blank-check firm is engineering a merger with TMTG, the company that owns Truth Social. The company buying Donald Trump's social network Truth Social has warned investors about the former president's history of bankruptcies and business failures. In a regulatory filing Monday, Digital World Acquisition Corp highlighted the bankruptcies of Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza, and Trump Castle, and the failures of Trump University, Trump Vodka, and Trump Steaks, among others. Digital World, a SPAC or ""blank-check"" firm, is seeking to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the owner of Truth Social. Trump himself would control between 47% and 58% of the merged company and would serve as its chairman, Monday's filing shows. Digital World said in its filing: ""A number of companies that were associated with President Trump have filed for bankruptcy. There can be no assurances that TMTG will not also become bankrupt."" It continued: ""A number of companies that had license agreements with President Trump have failed. There can be no assurances that TMTG will not also fail."" It added: ""While all of the foregoing were in different businesses than TMTG, there can be no guarantee that TMTG's performance will exceed the performance of those entities."" TMTG did not immediately respond when contacted by Insider for comment. Monday's filing also showed that Trump has agreed to post on Truth Social six hours before making similar posts on other platforms. However, it also stipulated that Trump can post from any platform at any time for ""political messaging."" Trump launched Truth Social in February as an alternative to mainstream social media platforms, most notably Twitter. Truth Social was plagued with technical difficulties upon launch and Trump was silent on the platform until late April. Twitter permanently suspended Trump's account in January 2021 after he posted a video telling rioters at the January 6 insurrection: ""We love you; you're very special."" However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has proposed buying Twitter for $44 billion, has said he would reinstate Trump's account if the deal completes. Trump told Fox News he won't return to Twitter even if his account is reactivated, although advisers close to him told The Washington Post they doubted this. TMTG is planning to launch a streaming service called TMTG+ and has posted job ads for producers, Forbes reported Friday.

The situation would be f*cking awesome. They [Bayraktars] don’t work in the daytime, they work at night. The birds take off, get our coordinates and we’re f*cked."" Details: He [the Russian soldier] himself ridicules talk about Russia’s ""glory"", since Russia ""itself stirred up this special operation"" but didn’t arm its soldiers properly. At present, according to the aggressor, they [Russian soldiers] are forced to beg for everything from their sponsors - farmers and children collect money for quadcopters (drones with four rotors) for Russian soldiers. The invaders are also following with alarm news of new deliveries of foreign weapons for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. They are particularly frightened by reports that ""the Poles have delivered 2,000 - or 200 - tanks to Ukraine."" The Security Service of Ukraine has pointed out that Ukraine has news of ""new guns and lend-lease"", so that the aggressors will have ""a lot of discoveries - not only in the news but also on the battlefield.""",World/Ukrayinska Pravda,Terror-stricken Russians anticipate the delivery of foreign arms to the Armed Forces of Ukraine - conversation intercepted by the Security Service of Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/terror-stricken-russians-anticipate-delivery-074112562.html
