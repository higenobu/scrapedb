1/16/2022,"Put out more flags. Book in the ticker-tape cannon. Prepare, once again, to be long-range triumphant. Make a nice cup of tea and perhaps everyone else will be along in a moment. At the final whistle here there was a heartfelt staccato cheer around those swooping cantilevered stands. Fists were clenched, seats vacated, aisles filled, the moment locked in.  It would be churlish to suggest that the home fans failed to appear suitably wowed, zapped, or gripped with ecstasies at the realisation, two weeks into January, that this was pretty much it, another Premier League title all-but-lassoed in by a measured victory against a Chelsea team billed (it says here) as City’s closest challengers. In the event Chelsea played out most of this game like a high-grade FA Cup minnow in search of a lucrative replay. But then, this is where we are now, the pitch of sustained performance attained by this brilliantly relentless sky-blue machine. The strangest thing about the table isn’t City’s 13-point lead, but the bit that states they have apparently lost two games along the way. Really? Can we factcheck this? Can we have a deep dive into exactly when and how this happened? This meeting of first v second boiled down into a kind of slow-burn tactical arm-wrestle, a struggle for space decided by a startling moment of thrust from perhaps the most interesting player in City’s ranks. Kevin De Bruyne is an unusual presence in some ways. He has the standard broad portfolio of roles, from deep midfield to false nine. But one of his key strands is a kind of throwback role, something from the 1990s: the surge-midfielder, the Gerrard-archetype, the knees-high, surging, shooting powerhouse who drives from box to box, shoots from distance, Captain Marvels around the place and who might, in a Pep Guardiola team, seem a little risky and out of kilter. Not, though, when you can do it like this. It was that De Bruyne surge, that old-school dance move that broke this game open after 75 minutes on a mild, damp, misty day in Manchester that had seemed to be congealing into stalemate. “We will hunt them down and make them underperform,” Thomas Tuchel had announced before kick-off, which is, if nothing else, expert pre-match fighting talk. We will do such things. They will be terrors of the Earth. But what would those things be? Tuchel’s plan, his depth charges, the bombs dropped on this City system turned out to be a kind of cold porridge of strangulation. Everyone has a plan until you stand slightly too close to them and nibble their ankles. For much of the first half those two banks of blue pushed up against one another, leaving no space, no air. At times there were groans around as City repeatedly made space but seemed to lacked something simple: a body in the right space to finish, an urge to cross the ball. It is tempting to crave these old-school comforts when City are bogged down by an opponent like this. Would Chris Wood make a difference? Should Guardiola revise his plan, tear up the playbook, go “proper”, instruct his wingers to bomb in the crosses? Then again, City are 13 points clear, so, you know. But someone needed to do something. It was De Bruyne who found that moment with something that will look, in isolation, like an old-school moment of surge-power but which was in reality a case of waiting, waiting some more, and being able to see that single opening when it came. João Cancelo laid the ball inside and suddenly De Bruyne was in space between those tightly knit lines. He felt it instantly and began to surge, legs pumping, bouncing off N’Golo Kanté, who also read it but was just the wrong side. De Bruyne knows this pathway to goal, has something in his stride, the picture his brain conjures at these moments, the way he starts to see the arc of the shot, to angle his body four steps ahead. He veered inside, unobstructed, with time to nudge the ball into his stride and, with a full sight of the goal, curl the shot into the far corner. Arrizabalaga dived and, for form’s sake, raised an arm a little sadly, but his only real function here was to act as a kind of usher, a ground crew member semaphoring the ball into the corner of the Chelsea net. De Bruyne left the pitch with five minutes to go, like a grandee being wheeled away by his retinue, applauded on all sides, race run, bath chair calling. For much of the second half he looked a little puce and drained of breath. It has been seven years now for De Bruyne at City, six of them under Guardiola. He seems, as he enters his 30s, a little more distinct, a more stately figure. But he had four shots at goal here, the same number as the entire Chelsea playing staff, made four dribbles, more than anyone else on the pitch, and provided the single outstanding moment of a game that became the first step on the victory lap.",Sport/Football,Kevin De Bruyne’s flash of old-school magic leaves Chelsea spellbound | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/15/kevin-de-bruynes-flash-of-old-school-magic-leaves-chelsea-spellbound
1/16/2022,"Alfie Barbeary rounded off a famous victory for Wasps over the European champions Toulouse by scoring the decisive second-half try and sending a timely reminder of his burgeoning talent to Eddie Jones. Wasps played more than half the match with 14 men after Jacob Umaga’s red card in the 34th minute but produced a remarkably resilient performance. If Wasps felt aggrieved at Umaga’s red card they channelled their anger to hugely impressive effect with Barbeary again on song. He has had a torrid run of injuries since bursting on to the scene but Jones names his Six Nations squad on Tuesday and on this evidence it would be a surprise if the 21-year-old is not included.  Barbeary was not alone in shining for Wasps, however. Jimmy Gopperth delivered another performance of quiet authority and supreme goal-kicking, James Gaskell, Charlie Atkinson and Biyi Alo all showed up well. Perhaps the greatest shame about the decision was that for the time he was on the field Umaga was inspired. Joining the line from full-back, his variety of kicks kept the defenders guessing and he was defensively robust to boot. There appeared to be mitigation in that Martin Page Relo had been tackled by Atkinson and was falling but ultimately the referee, Chris Busby, decided Umaga deserved a second red card in successive matches. Ramos kicked Toulouse to within four points but Wasps weathered the storm until the interval and produced a second-half performance for the ages. It was an ominous start for Wasps, who came into the match buoyant after ending Leicester’s winning run last Sunday but found themselves a try down after 70 seconds when François Cros flopped over from close range. But the procession from the champions never materialised. Instead, Wasps established a foothold and then the ascendancy. They were level when Alo went over from close range and then ahead when Brad Shields was awarded the try after a driving maul. Wasps lost Tom Wills to injury on 25 minutes but they continued to carry the fight to Toulouse before Umaga’s red card. A Gopperth penalty, after Toulouse infringed at the scrum, pushed Wasps’ lead back out to seven early in the second half, however – the home side refusing to be cowed by their numerical disadvantage. Barbeary had been, by his standards, quiet but one of his trademark surges up the middle brought another three points from Gopperth and a yellow card for the Toulouse No 8, Anthony Jelonch. There were certainly parallels with Umaga’s tackle – Jelonch going high on Barbeary after Page Relo had initially tackled the Wasps’ back-rower. Toulouse fought their way back to within five points with the hooker, Peato Mauvaka, finishing off from the back of a maul but when they threatened again Barbeary was on hand for a crucial turnover and familiar celebration to boot. Soon after he powered his way over in the right corner after Atkinson had passed up a golden opportunity with Ali Crossdale outside him, and moments later Barbeary’s interception and subsequent kick forward almost teed up Bassett. A late Gopperth penalty sealed the victory and ensured that even though Toulouse struck with a last-gasp try through Emmanuel Meafou, they missed out on a losing bonus point.",Sport/Sport,Alfie Barbeary leads way for 14-man Wasps in famous win against Toulouse,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/15/wasps-toulouse-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
1/16/2022,"England got their Quad Series campaign off to a determined start as they downed South Africa 70-47 in the first of the tournament’s four matches. A bright start by England, Geva Mentor, winning her 150th cap, had the home side burst out the gates breezing to a seven-goal lead. But as the Roses soared South Africa charged, providing a sharp reminder why international netball is no easy ride.  The Proteas’ captain, Bongi Msomi, pulled her strings allowing her side all-important entry into the encounter and cutting the deficit to three. The entry of the goal shooter Georgia Fisher for Eleanor Cardwell injected a much-needed spark to an England resolute on addressing their early shortcomings. The 23-year-old’s chemistry with home-favourite Helen Housby was obvious and with a shift in defence style the Roses cracked onwards. Ahead 36-24 at the start of the third, and on a roll, England never looked back. With the scoreboard singing their head coach, Jess Thirlby, threw her entire bench into the fray, critical for load management for the games to come. As the siren sounded a sense of relief was felt.

1/16/2022,"When the cryptocurrency bitcoin first made its appearance in 2009, an interesting divergence of opinions about it rapidly emerged. Journalists tended to regard it as some kind of incomprehensible money-laundering scam, while computer scientists, who were largely agnostic about bitcoin’s prospects, nevertheless thought that the distributed-ledger technology (the so-called blockchain) that underpinned the currency was a Big Idea that could have far-reaching consequences. In this conviction they were joined by legions of techno-libertarians who viewed the technology as a way of enabling economic life without the oppressive oversight of central banks and other regulatory institutions. Blockchain technology had the potential to change the way we buy and sell, interact with government and verify the authenticity of everything from property titles to organic vegetables. It combined, burbled that well-known revolutionary body Goldman Sachs, “the openness of the internet with the security of cryptography to give everyone a faster, safer way to verify key information and establish trust”. Verily, cryptography would set us free.  At its core, a blockchain is just a ledger – a record of time-stamped transactions. These transactions can be any movement of money, goods or secure data – a purchase at a store, for example, the title to a piece of property, the assignment of an NHS number or a vaccination status, you name it. In the offline world, transactions are verified by some central third party – a government agency, a bank or Visa, say. But a blockchain is a distributed (ie, decentralised) ledger where verification (and therefore trustworthiness) comes not from a central authority but from a consensus of many users of the blockchain that a particular transaction is valid. Verified transactions are gathered into “blocks”, which are then “chained” together using heavy-duty cryptography so that, in principle, any attempt retrospectively to alter the details of a transaction would be visible. And oppressive, rent-seeking authorities such as Visa and Mastercard (or, for that matter, Stripe) are nowhere in the chain. Given all that, it’s easy to see why the blockchain idea evokes utopian hopes: at last, technology is sticking it to the Man. In that sense, the excitement surrounding it reminds me of the early days of the internet, when we really believed that our contemporaries had invented a technology that was democratising and liberating and beyond the reach of established power structures. And indeed the network had – and still possesses – those desirable affordances. But we’re not using them to achieve their great potential. Instead, we’ve got YouTube and Netflix. What we underestimated, in our naivety, were the power of sovereign states, the ruthlessness and capacity of corporations and the passivity of consumers, a combination of which eventually led to corporate capture of the internet and the centralisation of digital power in the hands of a few giant corporations and national governments. In other words, the same entrapment as happened to the breakthrough communications technologies – telephone, broadcast radio and TV, and movies – in the 20th century, memorably chronicled by Tim Wu in his book The Master Switch. Will this happen to blockchain technology? Hopefully not, but the enthusiastic endorsement of it by outfits such as Goldman Sachs is not exactly reassuring. The problem with digital technology is that, for engineers, it is both intrinsically fascinating and seductively challenging, which means that they acquire a kind of tunnel vision: they are so focused on finding solutions to the technical problems that they are blinded to the wider context. At the moment, for example, the consensus-establishing processes for verifying blockchain transactions requires intensive computation, with a correspondingly heavy carbon footprint. Reducing that poses intriguing technical challenges, but focusing on them means that the engineering community isn’t thinking about the governance issues raised by the technology. There may not be any central authority in a blockchain but, as Vili Lehdonvirta pointed out years ago, there are rules for what constitutes a consensus and, therefore, a question about who exactly sets those rules. The engineers? The owners of the biggest supercomputers on the chain? Goldman Sachs? These are ultimately political questions, not technical ones. Blockchain engineers also don’t seem to be much interested in the needs of the humans who might ultimately be users of the technology. That, at any rate, is the conclusion that cryptographer Moxie Marlinspike came to in a fascinating examination of the technology. “When people talk about blockchains,” he writes, “they talk about distributed trust, leaderless consensus and all the mechanics of how that works, but often gloss over the reality that clients ultimately can’t participate in those mechanics. All the network diagrams are of servers, the trust model is between servers, everything is about servers. Blockchains are designed to be a network of peers, but not designed such that it’s really possible for your mobile device or your browser to be one of those peers.” And we’re nowhere near that point yet.

1/16/2022,"Gurkha activists have launched a scathing attack on Priti Patel’s controversial policing bill, describing it as “highly dangerous” and warning that it would criminalise their future campaigning work. Gurkha groups, who recently protested outside parliament for equal military pensions with the British soldiers they served alongside, say the bill would crush similar campaigns because of its intention to restrict the right to protest.  On Monday, the House of Lords will vote on the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, although a development on Friday suggested the proposals could be killed. Labour peers said they would be “opposing protest clauses added late” to the bill, a reference to 18 pages of amendments on powers to control protests, introduced last November. These include powers for the home secretary to ban marches and demonstrations because they might be too “noisy” or “disruptive”, as well as threaten organisers with heavy fines and up to 10 years in jail. Police would also have more control over where and when demonstrations took place, with extended stop and search powers to target people and vehicles. Last summer, Gurkhas staged a 13-day hunger strike outside Downing Street that was called off when the government agreed to enter talks over equal military pensions. The campaigners, who served with the British army in two world wars and during the past 50 years in campaigns including the Falklands, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan, warn that the bill’s new powers would make such peaceful protests illegal. Premila van Ommen of Gurkha Equal Rights said: “The bill [is] dangerous because it’s so ambiguous and arbitrary. We’re concerned about not being able to protest in particular places, certain areas around parliament. “Our protests have been effective because they have been in front of Downing Street and opposite parliament. If the Gurkhas had not protested there, the world would not have noticed. Location is really important. During our protests over the summer, we had loads of banners and flags, it was very colourful and visible with huge posters of the Victoria Cross winners. Could that have been deemed too loud, too annoying or disruptive?” Ommen also said the policing of the summer protests offered a worrying glimpse of what can happen when officers enforce vague laws. “[The police] harassed the veterans every night, saying they were not allowed to sleep there and telling us to take our gazebo down because of ambiguously worded bylaws.” Emmanuelle Andrews, policy and campaigns manager of human rights group Liberty, said: “The Gurkha campaigners are one among many groups fighting tirelessly to defend their rights and demand justice. But under the government’s proposed new laws, they would be silenced. Their hunger strike outside Downing Street won them vital assurances from the government – but their protest could be made illegal under new laws to criminalise protest.” She added: “This bill is a serious threat to everyone’s ability to make their voices heard, but particularly the most marginalised, for whom protest is often the only way to stand up to power.” More than 800,000 people and 350 civil liberty groups have signed a petition calling for the bill to be scrapped. Parliament’s joint committee on human rights calls the proposals “oppressive and wrong”. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Freedom to protest within the law is a fundamental part of our democracy, but the police must swiftly deal with the selfish minority of protesters whose actions endanger the public, jeopardise security or stop people going about their lives”.",News/UK news,"‘Dangerous’ new UK policing bill would crush protests like ours, Gurkhas warn",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/15/dangerous-new-uk-policing-bill-would-crush-protests-like-ours-gurkhas-warn
1/16/2022,"In an ideal world, Cathy Mitchell wouldn’t have to spend her time worrying about a £1bn-plus investment portfolio. The former barrister and deputy leader of Warrington borough council would usually have her mind on schools, adult social care and bus services, with the investments looking after themselves. But things are far from normal for the Cheshire borough or its book of assets: one of its flagship stakes – a 50% share in stricken firm Together Energy – is reportedly on the verge of going up in smoke. Warrington has followed councils across the country in ploughing cash into commercial schemes in the hope of generating returns that can offset a decade of Conservative austerity. However, critics say the Labour-run council has taken the high-stakes strategy too far: putting public money into risky ventures in property, energy and finance – including some firms backed by super-rich Tory donors.  “I would rather not be involved in investments as we have better things to do,” says Mitchell, who is the council’s portfolio holder for corporate resources. “But as long as we aren’t funded properly by the government, I don’t feel we have much choice.” Warrington’s energy supply gamble is close to backfiring as Together Energy prepares to appoint administrators. It is the latest among almost 30 small providers to face collapse amid the surging wholesale gas prices that are contributing to the UK’s cost- of-living emergency. The company declined to comment. The council’s investments since 2019 – made with the aim of earn a return and tackling fuel poverty in one fell swoop – have brought it more than £50m of exposure in debt, equity and guarantees to Together, which is based 200 miles away in Clydebank. While it is unclear how much Warrington could lose, it is thought to be less than the headline figure suggests. Mitchell says she can’t comment on a live situation, but insists protections are in place, and that appropriate governance checks were made before investing. “It’s not the council running it; it’s a proper energy company,” says Mitchell. “They’re industry professionals with a lot of experience. We used external advisers and ran an internal workshop where we got all other [political] parties involved [before investing]. We were very careful about the investment.” Her critics beg to differ. The stake in Together Energy is just one of many deals done by the town known for its rugby league club and former wire industry. They include shares in a bank, loans to a giant online retailer, and property ranging from shopping centres and business parks to solar farms in Hull, York and Cirencester. Andy Carter, Conservative MP for Warrington South, worries that the council has bitten off more than it can chew. “It didn’t have to do this,” he says. “Other councils in the north-west have far more meagre levels of borrowing and operate in a different way. It’s a decision taken by councillors to adopt what I think is a really risky strategy, and some of those risks are now coming home to roost. “I’m not saying councils shouldn’t do any borrowing. To do [it] here and there to make strategic investments in your community is a good thing. But Warrington has taken it to an extreme level.” Undeterred, councillors last week approved a fresh £37.5m loan, this time to affordable housing developer Auxesia Homes. Backed by European firm Matter Real Estate and Gary Metcalf, a property developer who was briefly owner of Chester City Football Club, Auxesia specialises in homes for services personnel and NHS workers across the north-west. Critics say this should have been more closely scrutinised. “Have any lessons been learned from the council’s Together Energy investment?” asks Tory councillor Ken Critchley. “One has to ask why the normal providers of finance to private businesses are not providing these loans.” Elsewhere the town has a 33% stake in business bank Redwood, which is controlled by multimillionaire Tory donor David “Spotty” Rowland and his son Jonathan. Another Tory donor, Matthew Moulding, billionaire owner of the Hut Group (THG) has been granted a loan worth more than £150m by the council. The loan is secured on the online retailer’s vast distribution site on the outskirts of Warrington. Halfway between Manchester and Liverpool, Warrington is linked to both by the world’s first intercity railway and has motorways on three sides. This brought the town a warehousing boom in recent years – though it started in 1987, when Ikea picked Warrington for its first UK store. Mitchell says most of the investments are backed by physical assets, so Warrington is protected against defaults, and that the council is investing in local employers that create much-needed growth and jobs. A spokesman for Redwood declined to comment on the bank’s owners, but said it had loaned £133m in the town and wider region since its launch four years ago. Mitchell says investing is necessary to fund services and represents “Labour values in action”. She adds: “It’s difficult to avoid Conservatives when you’re dealing with these sorts of businesses. Sometimes you have to deal with people who you’re not on the same page with.” Warrington has never been short on ambition. Its town hall is an elegant Georgian mansion, and the opulent gates outside it were originally created for Queen Victoria. It achieved a sad fame, however, in 1993, when an IRA bomb killed two young boys. After years of decline, the town has pumped £130m into redeveloping Time Square into a publicly owned market and cinema complex. A similar investment in nearby Preston won plaudits for being “municipal socialism” in action. Andrew Burns, associate director of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, which represents public accounting professionals and sets standards, says Warrington’s approach is not new. Birmingham started a bank more than a century ago under Neville Chamberlain, he says, while noting growing demands for local financial autonomy to “level up” Britain’s poorer areas. But while he agrees that there are questions about how far Warrington is pushing it, he adds: “The ultimate test is the local ballot box. If people don’t like what they’re doing, they can vote them out.” In the pursuit of investment returns, Warrington has built up a debt pile worth £1.6bn. And that is due to rise to £2.3bn within two years, putting the council on track for debts worth more than 400% of operating revenue. With interest rates rising to tackle soaring inflation, higher borrowing costs could heap more pressure on the local authority. Warrington has mostly borrowed through the Public Works Loans Board, a Treasury agency which allows local authorities to borrow at low rates – close to those enjoyed by the UK government. However, along with councils including Aberdeen, Lancashire and Guildford, it has secured funds from global bond market investors. Moody’s, the credit ratings agency that monitors the council’s finances on their behalf, has noted that Warrington has a “high-risk appetite”, but a track record of budget delivery. Local authorities across the UK have come under severe strain during the pandemic as income collapsed and pressure on services increased. Ministers had to intervene in the cases of Northamptonshire and Croydon, which issued section 114 notices – meaning they could not meet their obligations. Last March the National Audit Office warned that 25 councils were on the brink of insolvency. Opposition leaders question whether Warrington should be allowed by central government rules to take such a high-risk strategy. “It’s been a little bit like the wild west,” says Carter. “Anyone can go in and borrow, and do what want to do with it. That’s certainly been the case with Warrington.” A government spokesperson said councils were restricted from borrowing to invest for yield, but that they were ultimately responsible for their own investment strategies, adding: “We have been clear that councils should not put taxpayers’ money at excessive risk in pursuit of commercial income.” Warrington’s other MP, Labour’s Charlotte Nichols, who represents the north of the town, admits the debt burden is a problem. “Of course it raises concerns, especially from people who don’t think the council should be in the business of investing,” she says. “Ultimately, I agree with that assessment, but I don’t see credible alternatives being offered. The government needs to cough up or councils like ours will be forced into finding other sources of revenue.” Mitchell says there would be worse dangers for Warrington if the council stopped investing. It has had to find £173m in savings since austerity began in 2010, equivalent to 60p in each £1. “This is about trying to protect people. What does it look like if you instead cut services for children at risk of harm, or for vulnerable people who need care in their home?”",News/Society,Austerity-hit council defends its ‘high-risk’ investment strategy,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/15/austerity-hit-council-defends-its-high-risk-investment-strategy
1/16/2022,"The mood last week in Ukraine was eerily calm, despite talk of war. The first winter snow blanketed Kyiv. Many were still celebrating Orthodox Christmas – which falls on 7 January – or had left town for the holidays. Bars and restaurants rang out with Dean Martin’s Let It Snow!, while the fir trees in Independence Square looked like a mini-Narnia. Sure, Russia might invade at any moment. But, as Ukrainians wearily point out, the country has already been at war for eight long years, ever since Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and kickstarted a brutish conflict in the east of the country, which has claimed nearly 14,000 lives. Friday’s dawn cyber-attack on government websites was merely the latest in a series of hostile acts.  What to do in the event of a military operation by Moscow, and whether to stay, flee or fight? The consensus – at least according to surveys – is that a third of the population is ready to take up arms. In the upmarket Podil district, with its art deco mansions, a new piece of graffiti read: “Biy Moskaliv!”(“Fight Russians!”) Sitting in a law office just across the road, Serhii Filimonov explains what he intends to do, should the Kremlin attack. “There are about 50 of us. We will meet and decide where we can best fight,” he said. His group is made up of middle-class professionals: IT staff, designers, actors, journalists. Filimonov runs a security business and starred in a film shown at Venice. None of this is likely to alarm Russia’s defence ministry, which has sent 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s border. These include the existing front between the Ukrainian army and the Moscow-run separatist territories of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east, as well as Belarus in the north, Crimea in the south and the breakaway Russian enclave of Transnistria in the west. But the Kyiv creatives know how to shoot. All are combat-hardened veterans of the 2014 war. Filimonov took part in the bloody battle for Ilovaysk, when the Russian army trapped Ukrainian forces, and was wounded by an enemy mortar strike. After an operation to remove shrapnel, he returned to the front, serving as a volunteer against Moscow with the Azov battalion. “We have registered weapons. We will defend our homes,” Filimonov said. “Putin wants to go back to the borders of the Russian empire. You can see this in Belarus, Kazakhstan. Here in Ukraine he wants to create a tsarstvo – a tsardom. This is a war of civilisations. It’s the west versus Eurasia, democracy against slavery and authoritarianism. We want democracy and freedom.” Most experts agree that Russia’s vastly superior army, air force and navy could quickly seize Ukrainian territory. But Andriy Zagorodnyuk, Kyiv’s former defence minister, says the Kremlin’s conscript-heavy military will immediately face resistance, should it try to occupy towns and cities. Volunteers such as Filimonov and small army groups will launch bloody partisan attacks. “There is definitely no panic. I don’t see any panic at all,” Zagorodnyuk told the Observer. He acknowledged Ukraine’s relative military weakness but he said Kyiv had around 500,000 soldiers including reservists. It was ready for guerrilla war “on a huge scale”, he said. Masi Nayyem, a lawyer who founded the Podil practice, admitted he was looking forward to shooting at Russians again. In 2016 he fought with a paratrooper brigade in Avdiyivka, Ukraine’s frontline position outside rebel-held Donetsk. “In peace time you have to be serious, responsible. In war you don’t have any considerations or need to think about consequences. It’s black and white,” he said. Talks between Russia and the US, Nato and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ended last week in a dead end. The Kremlin has demanded assurances from the Biden administration that Ukraine and Georgia will never join Nato. In essence it wants to overturn the post-cold war order – restoring central and eastern Europe as a zone of Warsaw Pact-style Russian influence, from which Nato troops and weaponry are banned. Beneath the Kremlin’s shrill, tough-man rhetoric lies a mystery. It is unclear why Putin is moving with such strategic haste, demanding that the US and its allies rewrite international security rules in Russia’s favour. His demands are “non-starters”, as the US’s negotiator and deputy secretary of state, Wendy Sherman, put it. Putin’s possible goal, she suggested, was to establish a pretext for war. Andrew Wilson, professor in Ukrainian studies at University College London, said the timing from the Kremlin’s perspective was opportune. Putin has jailed his chief domestic critic, Alexey Navalny, and squashed Navalny’s opposition movement. Russia was awash with cash, thanks to rising energy prices. On the international stage the Kremlin faces off against a US administration it regards as weak and indecisive. What could happen next? “Creating a crisis to create opportunities is what they [the Russians] do,” Wilson said. He added: “I don’t think a full-scale invasion is possibility number one. The Ukrainians have pretty successfully advertised the huge cost of invasion and occupation. But Putin has to have a win of sorts, either on European security or Ukraine itself.” All of which presents observers with a dilemma: how to report on a crisis which does not quite feel like a crisis, and appears largely to exist inside Putin’s head? It is evident that Russia’s president feels emotionally about Ukraine. Last summer he wrote a long essay stating that Ukraine and Russia were “one people”, divided by the whims of Bolshevik map-making and western meddling. “With nothing yet happening on the ground, there’s nothing I can report to tell you something new and impactful,” Nataliya Gumenyuk, a Ukrainian journalist and author admitted, saying it was hard to make sense of a conflict in which Ukraine often appears as a bystander. She added: “We are caught in the position of waiting for the ‘worst scenario’ without a chance to influence the outcome.” Gumenyuk said the Kremlin’s goal was to turn the clock back to the early 1970s, before the Soviet Union signed the Helsinki accords guaranteeing human rights – a mistake, in the eyes of Moscow’s current hawkish leadership. Others have argued that Putin’s preferred geo-political model goes back further, to the imperialist 19th century, when mighty great powers over-rolled lesser ones. In an opinion piece for the New York Times the eminent Russian political scientist Lila Shevtsova said the current stand-off over Ukraine had little in common with the political deals struck at Yalta in 1945, or at the congress of Vienna in 1815. Back then, the participants stuck to the rules. “[Putin’s] aim, really, is a Hobbesian world order, built on disruption and readiness for surprise breakthroughs,” she wrote. How a surprise breakthrough might morph into war is a topic of conversation inside the Kyiv government of comic-turned-president Volodymyr Zelensky. Little was seen of him last week. Zelensky won a landslide victory in 2019 after campaigning on a platform of peace. Faced with Russian intransigence over the fate of Ukraine’s already occupied territories, he has moved towards Nato and the west. US intelligence agencies say the risk of invasion is “high”. Their Ukrainian counterparts think Moscow may be planning a “staged provocation”. This could take the form of an attack on Russian citizens – at the embassy or consulate perhaps – or against Russian soldiers in Transnistria. The Kremlin would blame the “attack” on far-right Ukrainian nationalists, with the incident used for propaganda and as a casus belli. Alex Kovzhun, a political strategist who advised Ukraine’s former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, said the Kremlin needed to craft a compelling narrative. “They are obsessed with their TV ratings. All of us Ukrainians are extras in their internal TV show. They are the protagonists. From time to time they change the bad guys. Ukraine is not their favourite location.” Kovzhun added: “A fantastic postmodern storytelling device is the wink. In 2014 Putin winked when he said there were no Russian units in Crimea. It’s a conspiracy. He invites all Russian TV viewers to share in this conspiracy. He used the wink in Salisbury. Everybody knew two Russian idiots travelled there to kill Sergei Skripal, as part of a special operation.” It is just possible, of course, that Putin’s brinkmanship is part of an elaborate bluff, the latest in a series of stress tests designed to reveal weaknesses among the west’s ruling class and America. No one – save for the man in the Kremlin – can really know. But Filimonov thinks a storm is coming. “We are convinced something will happen,” he said. “Putin needs Ukraine. An attempt to seize it is inescapable. We will fight until the end.”",News/World news,‘We’ll fight to the end.’ Ukraine defiant in face of  Vladimir Putin’s phoney war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/15/well-fight-to-the-end-ukraine-defiant-in-face-of-vladimir-putins-phoney-war
1/16/2022,"All I can say is that I should have known better. No, my decision to visit the branch of Amazon Fresh that has just opened near where I live was not at all a good match for the sweeping month-long programme of mindfulness and joy-sparking I tentatively set in motion for myself on 1 January. But there I was all the same, curiosity having got the better of me. And yes, the result was predictably awful. As any wellness guru worth the name could doubtless have told me, this way lay simmering despair and an almost overwhelming desire to buy a packet of Jacob’s Mini Cheddars. I still have no idea how Amazon got the go-ahead to set up a branch of the grocery wing of its rampaging empire in the grade-II listed building it now inhabits: an old tram depot that when I first came to this part of London was the home of lots of little antique shops (RIP). There was, I seem to remember, a bit of a kerfuffle over its alcohol licence, but in the end it got the green light, in spite of the fact that there are already three large supermarkets mere metres away. Now it stands there rather mournfully, its lurid sign seemingly aiming to attract either those who simply cannot be bothered to cross the road, or those who prefer to keep on their headphones as they shop. (Amazon Fresh’s USP is that it has no tills, so customers need not speak to a single soul.) This, I have read, is one of 10 branches in the capital so far; by 2025, the company hopes to have 260 across the UK.  For a while, I wandered dazedly around, struggling to absorb the full – sorry, I’m going to have to use the word – dystopian weirdness. The silence. The bright lights. The banks of cameras above my head. The store is, I would say, angled strongly towards the young and single. There are lots of meals for one in transparent plastic boxes, and an expansive selection of instant noodles. But it’s quite a hotch-potch. Some of the stuff is Amazon branded, but there are also – bizarrely – a number of things from my beloved Booth’s, the so-called Waitrose of the north. On the day I visited, there were three members of staff on hand: one at the entrance, which has gates you enter by using an app on your phone; another standing guard by the booze; and a third at the counter where you can pick up Amazon parcels. But no matter! In place of human interaction, there are urgently perky signs. “SO GOOD IT’S GONE” read the ones on any shelf that is temporarily empty. I followed (in a strictly non-peculiar way) a twentysomething woman with a huge rucksack into which she was hurling her shopping while simultaneously frantically WhatsApping on her phone. It seemed hard to imagine that she could just walk out – “YOU’RE GOOD TO GO” says the sign – with all this booty. But when, like some nervous old granny, I checked, the man at the gate assured me that the cameras miss nothing: no packet of ramen goes unnoticed by their all-seeing eyes. Does this have a peculiar effect on shoppers? I’m guessing that it does, and will do until the novelty wears off. Because no bill is totted up, and no money exchanged (you’re charged via your Amazon account), it’s almost as if everything is free. It is the daylight sober version of late-night drunken internet shopping – though it’s open till 11pm, so it can be both, I guess. Twenty-first century capitalism’s great trick is to make us long for the useless and the unnecessary and, sure enough, grim and lonely though it was inside Amazon Fresh, I could feel that itch starting up. If there was nothing I needed, surely there was something I wanted. Restlessly roaming the aisles, I felt as I did when I first left home and, hardly knowing how to feed myself, my diet was often strange and disordered. Into my bag I put some spring rolls, a box of Feel New tea (an energising blend of aniseed, fennel and cardamom, apparently) and, yes, a packet of Cheddars, which I ate on the walk home, feeling a bit dead inside. The future rose up ahead of me, all vegetable oil, bad decisions and urban desolation.",Lifestyle/Food,There’s a new Amazon Fresh shop near me – so I just popped in ,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/15/amazon-fresh-near-me-spring-rolls-and-despair-rachel-cooke
1/16/2022,"Ken Wheeler was a Canadian trumpet player who moved to Britain in 1952, became part of the London jazz world and gradually turned into an internationally renowned composer. His work has elements of jazz and classical music, but mostly it’s pure Ken. When he died, in 2014, he left the outline manuscript of a three-movement composition for his longtime colleague and friend, the bassist Chris Laurence. Its title, Piece for Double Bass and Low Strings, doesn’t look very exciting, but at least it tells you what to expect. It’s rare to hear a double bass as star of the show, and Laurence is a wonderful soloist – firm, supple and gloriously adventurous. To accompany him, Ken turned the customary string ensemble upside down, with the bass as soloist on top of two violas, two cellos and one violin, plus vibraphone (Frank Ricotti) and drums (Martin France).  The resulting sound is magical and possibly unique. The second of the album’s three Wheeler pieces, C-Man, without the strings but with guitarist John Parricelli added, is less formal and full of fascinating interplay, while the third, Baroque Piece, features Tom Walsh on flugelhorn.",Arts/Music,Chris Laurence: Ken Wheeler – Some Gnu Ones review – magical and possibly unique,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/15/chris-laurence-ken-wheeler-some-gnu-ones-review
1/16/2022,"When furniture designer Nada Debs first moved to Beirut from London in 2000 on a quest to reconnect with her Lebanese roots, her parents offered her the apartment they’d bought in the 1980s. “At the time it was rented out and they just said: ‘Why don’t you take it?’ So it was more a marriage of convenience than the thunderclap of love at first sight.” Located on the 10th floor of a 1970s apartment block in a residential area of West Beirut, there was nothing immediately remarkable about the space.  “The apartment isn’t something I’d have chosen,” says Debs. “But I made the best of it and because it was simple, I had a lot of freedom to use my furniture. I would make prototypes, put them out and see how they looked, before I made them into collections. I used my home as kind of a place of experimentation.” When Debs first got her hands on the apartment she set about stamping her vision on the space, tearing down walls to let the light in and make the most of the breathtaking views of the sea and mountains. “I love breaking walls,” she says with a gleeful twinkle. “The apartment was originally designed for a family and there were four bedrooms, but it’s just me here, so I tried to make it less for a family and more a space for entertaining.” Today her home is flooded with light as Debs leads the way through a series of elegant living spaces, popping with jewel colours. Her curvaceous Yves Klein Blue sofa, that she designed herself, is a striking focal point. “I’m a big fan of blue – the blues of Beirut are beautiful. And every day the colour of this sea and the sky is different, so that definitely influenced me,” she says. Then there’s the cosy pink kitchen/diner, which was inspired by the lush visuals of the Hong Kong-set movie In the Mood for Love. From here we walk through to the yellow TV room, which was originally the balcony, but now serves as an indoor/outdoor living area that catches the morning sun. “I always like to start with colour or colour combinations, before thinking about form and then, finally, I address the details,” she says. “In this house each room is themed. I wouldn’t do that for a client, but this is more an experimental space and I think the colours work together.” And with three different living rooms to choose from, there’s a room for every mood. “It’s, ‘Oh am I going to be blue-me today or am I going yellow today?’ And it’s really interesting, when I have guests, people are drawn to different colours. Some people look at the pink room and think, ‘Oh I’m not going in there, it’s a bit too cozy, I’ll never get up again. So it’s more for late at night.’” Dramatic dark doors add an extra layer of sophistication, while rugs play a key role in separating the spaces. “I based the apartment on placing carpets first,” says Debs. “When you have an open space it’s really hard to place furniture first, but when you put a carpet down that defines the space.” When it comes to form, Nada is big on rounded corners and spherical shapes, partly because they make a home more friendly, “we’re just looking for things that are soft when we want to touch which we all need, especially at the moment after Covid.” But also because it allows her to push the envelope with the craft. “The Romania table in the dining room uses a technique called marquetry strips and I noticed I could curve it, so I decided to create a whole line of furniture where I could do that,” she explains. Of course, the large apartment, with its clean lines and open space, is the perfect backdrop to her standout furniture and many of the pieces, like the Coffee Bean coffee table, so named because her son, who was six at the time, said it looked like a coffee bean, are available made-to-order from her website. Despite her own elegant, pared-back aesthetic, Debs is wary of hotel-like, interior-designed spaces. “Too perfect is soulless. You have to have knick-knacks,” she says firmly. “A home should be personalised and not so rigid. The frame can be a bit to the side, it doesn’t have to be perfect, that’s OK.” For her own part, she likes to mix up finds from Beirut’s Basta antique market alongside favourite art pieces and the odd family heirloom, like the oversized round Chinese terracotta rug in the sitting room, which her uncle bought back from Shanghai in the 1950s. Originally trained in interior architecture at the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design in the US, Debs had been working with marquetry in the UK, a technique used to create patterns on furniture, but her move to Beirut inspired a bold new direction in her work. “When I came to Lebanon, I was looking for Middle Eastern furniture, and I realised it was stuck in the past,” she says. “Everyone was just buying imported B&B furniture from Italy, and all these contemporary European brands, and they were neglecting their own furniture because it was so old fashioned. I was asking, ‘Where’s Middle Eastern furniture?’ And it didn’t exist. So I created my own.” She began working with local craftsmen and artisans, reconfiguring the Middle Eastern designs to give them a more contemporary feel. “Because I grew up in Japan, I introduced my Japanese aesthetics, which is about simplifying and bringing things down to its essence.” They didn’t think that they were allowed to do that. They were sticking to the old ways, because that’s what they thought was the right thing to do. But I kind of gave them the OK. You could change the patterns. You could change the models, you can keep it simple, and suddenly you open this whole door.” The concrete tiles that line the wall of the yellow TV area with their modern take on traditional Middle Eastern geometric patterns and the white Arabesque chairs with their swirling foliage pattern and the lattice screen, are all examples of her “Neo Arabian” aesthetic, as she calls it. “When I moved to Beirut, after Japan where no one was like me, I was looking for like-minded people, but then I realised I wasn’t Lebanese either, because of my upbringing, so my work is a reflection of that,” she explains. “That’s the little twist in my work, because Japanese style is quite understated, whereas in the Middle East everything is overstated.” nadadebs.com",Lifestyle/Life and style,A modern twist on the Middle Eastern aesthetic in Beirut,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/15/a-modern-twist-on-the-middle-eastern-aesthetic-in-beirut
1/16/2022,"Last year’s boom in British summer holidays was not enough to save thousands of tourism businesses, despite increased domestic bookings to popular places such as Cornwall and the Yorkshire Dales. A survey by the Tourism Alliance of 1,927 tour operators, hotels, attractions, language schools and other travel and hospitality businesses serving foreign tourists found that 11% believe they are “very likely to fail” in 2022, and a total of 41% think they are “quite likely to fail”.  The first three months of 2022 are looking bleak, with cancellations soaring in the wake of the Omicron variant. Almost a third of businesses surveyed have lost at least half of bookings made for domestic holidays between January and March this year. With far less government support available after the end of the furlough scheme, a quarter of those surveyed said they had no more cash reserves, and just over half said they would run out within two months. Last summer saw crowded beaches and sold-out seaside resorts, but that masked an overall drop in domestic tourism away from coastal and rural areas, according to Kurt Janson, director of the Tourism Alliance. The alliance comprises more than 60 trade associations that together represent 303,000 UK travel businesses. “There’s traditionally been a huge amount of domestic tourism in towns and cities, and a lot of business travel and conferences, and those sectors have done very badly,” Janson said. “Businesses that rely on international travel have done badly – language schools, events, conferences. And because booking times for these things are longer, they will take longer to recover.” Janson was particularly concerned about tour operators serving foreign visitors. “They are responsible for about 60% of overseas visitors to the UK and if they are not out there promoting the UK as a destination, inbound tourism will take a long time to recover. We need them out there, fighting for our corner of the market.” One indication of the struggles facing the tourism sector came last week, when the Hungarian government said it would again delay a scheme that would have seen as many as 60,000 students visiting the UK this summer. “It would have been a massive boost,” said Huan Japes, membership director of English UK, the trade body for language schools. “We used to get 550,000 students coming, but we’ve barely risen above 100,000 a year since the pandemic.” Janson said the figures showed it was unlikely that the government’s tourism recovery plan would meet its targets. It hopes to see a bounceback to 2019 levels of domestic tourism by the end of the year, and of overseas tourism by the end of 2023. The UK was becoming less competitive as an international destination, Janson said. Visitors could no longer reclaim VAT when they left, other countries were spending more on marketing, and EU visitors now needed passports to enter the UK. Tourists from China and Middle Eastern countries were keen to shop in places like Bicester Village, but were now more likely to choose France because they could get a tax refund when they left. (The UK scrapped the VAT reclaim scheme at the end of 2020.) “The government has basically said to those visitors ‘don’t come here – go to Paris instead’,” said Janson. He said the government urgently needed to promote the UK as a destination. Ireland is spending £33m. Australia will spend £250m in the next three years, and the US is about to approve a £185m budget to rebuild its tourism industry. Joss Croft, chief executive of trade body UKinbound, said: “These figures lay bare the devastating impact the pandemic continues to have on the UK’s inbound, outbound and domestic tourism industry, along with the entire supply chain. We are seeing green shoots, but the crippling border restrictions and ever-changing government guidance continue to stifle recovery.” From 1 April, hotels, restaurants and other hospitality firms will have to start paying business rates again, as well as VAT at the full 20%, following the reduction to 12.5% during the pandemic. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said keeping the reduced rate would bolster the tourism trade, instead of raising prices for staycationers and overseas tourists. “The main driver for inbound tourism is price, and travel to the UK is very price sensitive,” she said. “A 1% fall in the cost of a holiday in the UK delivers a 1.3% increase in inbound tourism revenue for the economy.” Bernard Donoghue, chief executive of the Association for Leading Visitor Attractions, said: “Tourism was hit first, hit hardest and will take the longest to recover, and those attractions and businesses which are usually highly dependent on inbound tourists, who have been absent for nearly two years, will take the longest to recover of all. Our industry lost, on average, £200m a day in 2021.”",News/Business,UK tourism industry in peril as overseas visitors stay away,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/15/uk-tourism-industry-in-peril-as-overseas-visitors-stay-away
1/16/2022,"The number of Covid infections appears to have reached a plateau in parts of the UK, a senior government health adviser has said, with experts expressing optimism about the latest data. Infections are flattening in London, the south-east and the east of England, while the rise is slowing in the north of England, said Dr Susan Hopkins, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) chief medical adviser.  Case figures remain relatively high, however, with an estimated one in 15 people in England infected, while the figure for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is one in 20. About one in 10 people in north-west England had Covid-19 last week, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. London’s rate fell from one in 10 at the end of 2021 to one in 15 in the week ending 6 January. While hospital admissions have not yet begun to fall, their rate of increase is also slowing down, Hopkins told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We are seeing a slowdown in the number of admissions to hospital, but they are slowing down rather than reversing at the moment, so there are still more than 2,000 admissions to hospital across the UK, and nearly 2,500 yesterday.” The latest data comes after more than one in six NHS trusts in England declared critical incidents due to Covid pressures, many as a result of staff shortages. Meanwhile, almost 6 million people in England – a record figure – are currently waiting for hospital treatment, NHS figures show. Hopkins said hospitals had been able to discharge patients more quickly because of Omicron less severe than previous variants. With about 15,500 people in hospital last week, however, some trusts remain “unable to do much of their elective care”. Dr Chris Smith, a consultant virologist and lecturer based at Cambridge University, said the latest figures gave him “great cause for optimism”, telling BBC Breakfast: “The number of people who are going into intensive care or are on mechanical ventilation beds is actually dropping.” As 96% of people in the country now have antibodies, the vast majority of people are able to better “fend off” the disease and “we don’t see that strong connection of cases turning into consequences”. Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at the Edinburgh University and chief social policy adviser to the Scottish government, also expressed cautious optimism. “The cases, if we look at them, are going down by over 20%,” she told BBC Breakfast, adding that Friday was the first day “for a while” that cases in the UK had fallen below 100,000. Bauld said that “things seem to be moving in the right direction” but warned that hospital numbers remained “very high”.",News/World news,"Covid cases have hit plateau in parts of UK, says top medical adviser",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/15/covid-cases-plateau-parts-of-uk-susan-hopkins-ukhsa
