4/27/2022,"A private collection of rarely seen sculptures by the French artists Claude and François-Xavier Lalanne is to go on sale to pay for an extension to the Musée d’Orsay in Paris. Daniel Marchesseau, a close friend of the sculptors for 50 years, agreed to part with the works as part of a €5m (£4.2m) gift to create an annexe for the archiving and research of 19th-century art. Among the Lalanne works are a large bronze tortoise planted with succulents, and one of François-Xavier’s Lalanne’s trademark sheep also in bronze, bird candlesticks, a mouse and butterfly chandelier and a pigeon lamp. Marchesseau, 74, an art historian and curator of several Paris museums, said he was donating the proceeds of the Sotheby’s auction next month to renovate the Hôtel de Mailly-Nesle, a 17th-century house on the other side of the Seine opposite the Louvre that will become the Musée d’Orsay’s Research and Archive Centre specialising in 19th-century art. When completed in 2025, it will be the Musée d’Orsay’s most significant heritage project. “The works left my apartment three to four days ago and I’m sobbing every morning but one has to know what one wants and my goal is far more important than keeping these works for myself, so it’s over,” Marchesseau told the Guardian. “The Lalannes were friends of mine for 50 years. I did commission some of the works myself but these weren’t official commissions, they were friendly requests. Ours was a wonderful relationship, so happy, friendly, trusting. I feel privileged to have known them and shared this pure friendship with them.” Marchesseau, former curator at the Paris Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Decorative Arts, and now director of the Museum of the Romantic Life in the French capital, is selling 18 Lalanne works. All are one-of-a-kind pieces or prototypes for later Lalanne sculptures. Asked about his donation, he said art curators had a responsibility to “set an example”. “I wanted to make a major heritage-focused contribution to the Musée d’Orsay. The idea that the work by this artist couple would contribute to renovate an architectural complex for the purposes of art-history seemed essential to me … we have to leave something that will last,” he said. François-Xavier Lalanne died in 2008 aged 81 and was a contemporary of René Magritte and Salvador Dali in post-war Paris. His wife, Claude, died in 2019 aged 93. Although known collectively as Les Lalanne, she worked mostly independently of her husband on her own works and collaborated with Yves Saint Laurent. Marchesseau said: “All their lives they were totally independent [artistically] and they paid a high price for that because they didn’t live very well until the end of their lives. They were just pleased to have a small, loyal network of friends. The Hôtel de Mailly-Nesle was once the home to the De Mailly family; four of whose five daughters were successively official mistresses of Louis XV. The building was later owned by the marshal of France during the revolution, when it was seized and used to store confiscated art works, then as a home for artists expelled from the Louvre. Only the eastern wing of the original building remains but contains extraordinary 17th-century decorations. The Musée d’Orsay acquired the building in 2016. Three of the De Mailly sisters were believed to be the models for the Carle van Loo’s 1765 painting The Three Graces. As well as the Lalanne sheep, one of dozens made by the artist, the Sotheby’s sale on 24 May will also include another of his other animal favourites in the Grand Rhinoceros II, a patinated bronze and leather desk, as well as works by René Lalique and Alberto Giacometti.",Arts/Art and design,Lalanne sculptures auction to pay for Paris museum extension,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/27/lalanne-sculptures-auction-to-pay-for-paris-museum-extension
4/27/2022,"My favourite way to eat asparagus is steamed and drenched in melted butter, and with such a brief season, it’s hard to tire of that simple pleasure … but, sometimes, the occasion demands a bit more effort. Not much, though; this tart, which plays on the grassy spears’ affinity with rich, creamy flavours, looks impressive, but is actually more of an assembly job. Prep 5 minChill 20 minCook 1 hr 10 minServes 4-6 For the pastry (or use 250g ready-made shortcrust pastry)225g plain flour, plus extra to dustSalt120g cold butter, plus extra to grease1 egg yolk For the filling300g asparagus284ml double cream2 eggs, beaten50g gruyère or nutty cheddar, or vegetarian alternative, finely gratedNutmeg, to grate (optional) You could use shop-bought shortcrust, but it’s increasingly hard to find any made with butter, and the others tend to both contain palm oil and not taste half as good, so I’d strongly recommend giving homemade a go; it’s really not as hard as they make out on Bake Off. Put the flour and a good pinch of salt in a large bowl, then grate or cut in the butter (alternatively, mix them in the small bowl of a food processor). Use your fingertips, or the pulse function, to rub the butter into the flour until you can no longer see any large pieces. Mix in the egg yolk to bring the mix together into a dough; if it’s too crumbly to form into a ball, add a little cold water; if it’s too sticky, add a bit more flour. Too much water will cause the pastry to shrink in the oven, while too much will make it hard to roll – aim for the smooth texture of plasticine. Squash the ball into a thick disc, wrap and chill for 20 minutes. If you want to get ahead, you can now leave it for up to a couple of days, but as with ready-made pastry, get it out of the fridge to soften up slightly before use. Meanwhile, grease a round, 22cm-diameter tart tin. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface until large enough to line the tin, then carefully lift it into the tin, pressing the pastry into the sides. Trim the excess, prick the base with a fork… … then line with baking paper and fill with baking beans, raw beans or rice. Bake for 15 minutes, until lightly golden, then carefully lift out the paper and beans – they will be hot. Return the tart base to the oven for five minutes. Meanwhile, snap the woody bits off the base of the asparagus, then steam the spears for about four minutes, or until al dente (how long this will take depends on their thickness, but bear in mind they will cook further in the oven, so err on the side of caution). Chop the asparagus into short lengths and set the tops aside for later. Put roughly half the rest of the asparagus pieces in a food processor and blitz to a puree. Pour the double cream into a jug, then beat in the eggs. Once the two are well combined, mix in the asparagus puree and grated cheese (almost any hard cheese will do here; parmesan or similar would also be nice) and season well with salt and a little grated nutmeg, if using. Arrange the remaining asparagus pieces, including the tops, on the base of the pastry, then pour in the egg mixture. Bake for about 35-40 minutes, until set and golden on top, but still a little jiggly in the middle. Leave to cool slightly, or completely, before serving – if you make this in advance, keep it covered, but at room temperature to prevent the pastry going soggy.

4/27/2022,"The family of Dorset teenager Gaia Pope has told an inquest jury that her mental and physical health deteriorated and she became “lost in fear and self-doubt” after she reported she had been raped at the age of 16. Relatives revealed the “joyful” girl they knew slipped away at times after she told police about the alleged rape, which led to an investigation but no charge. In a video played to the jury in Bournemouth, the family said: “After she shared that she had been raped, Gaia’s deteriorating physical and mental health changed her life. At times our girl would seem to disappear, lost in fear and self-doubt, but she fought bravely to return to us and her inner light always shone through the clouds.” Pope, 19, who had epilepsy, vanished from Swanage in November 2017 and her body was found on a clifftop 11 days later. The teenager was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after reporting she had been raped and was worried at the time of her disappearance that the man she accused – who was jailed on unrelated sexual offences – was about to be freed. On the day she vanished, Pope had been due to make a formal complaint to police after being sent indecent images on social media. The moving video and still images of Gaia and members of her family gave an insight into her story: “Gaia grew up in Dorset with her mum, Natasha, big sister Clara, twin sister Maya and cousin Marienna. “Gaia loved her family and her home deeply. She was happiest out in the Purbeck nature her grandparents introduced her to, inspired by its beauty and wildlife to create art or cuddling up with her beloved cat, Bella, a rescue prone to scratching others but who let Gaia cradle her like a baby. “Gaia was a force of nature and fiercely loyal to those she loved. Despite being bullied herself at school, or perhaps because of this, she was always ready to stand up for those who needed it. She was a shoulder to cry on and a friend to be relied on. With Gaia around there was never a dull moment or a quiet one. She had a joyful nature, a ready and radiant smile and filled our lives with song and laughter.” Despite her decline, the portrait said she kept hold of her dreams, hoping for a big family and to host Christmases in a Dorset cottage surrounded by family and friends. It added: “The challenges she faced as a young woman living with epilepsy and as a survivor of sexual violence inspired her to pursue a career in health and social care. Gaia had strong values and wanted to contribute to positive change for her community. This makes us so proud.” The video includes Gaia and her twin, Maya, singing together in a bedroom with a banner pinned to a wall reading: “This mess is a room.” The portrait concluded: “Above all, we remember Gaia’s immense passion, compassion and creativity. We give thanks for every day we got to share with her. The world is a darker place without Gaia and she will be missed every minute of the rest of our lives.” Video pen portraits are relatively new and have only been allowed on request at a handful of inquests. The charity Inquest, which is supporting members of Gaia’s family, is a big advocate for them as they allow relatives to show more of the person who has died. The inquest continues.",News/UK news,Gaia Pope: Dorset teenager was ‘lost in fear and self-doubt’ before death,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/27/gaia-pope-dorset-teenager-lost-fear-and-self-doubt-before-death
4/27/2022,"Welcome to Moving the Goalposts, the Guardian’s new (and free) women’s football newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below. It all began with a WhatsApp group. When repeated attempts to join men’s five-a-sides were knocked back, Romaney Pinnock decided to take matters into her own hands. “I put every woman I know in Cape Town into a group. I said I’m starting a football club.” It was in this moment that Badgers Academy was born. It is hard to imagine now, five years on. What started as 10 women simply learning the game has developed into a female-owned non-profit organisation that has a far-reaching impact, with 149 women and girls now registered. With provision for 11 and five-a-side, as well as school activations and social activities, they have recently joined the South African Football Association (SAFA) and will take part in their local league this season. They provide a safe and inclusive space where everyone is welcome: “We’re big on inclusivity. We don’t mind what your sexual orientation is, what your socioeconomic status is, any of that stuff. Because team sports are such a leveller.” The women’s game is progressing across South Africa with the national team reaching their first World Cup in 2019. This weekend, the Sasol League (SAFA’s provincial women’s league) kicked off with around 3,800 players involved. However, there are problems. In Cape Town, a city known for its socio-economic disparities, access to a traditionally male-dominated sport is challenging for many. Schools are under-funded and under-resourced, while lack of safety and poor infrastructure make it difficult for girls to participate. Badgers tackle this through their partnerships with schools and junior football, providing a way for girls to garner a love for the sport as well as build their self-confidence. Community manager and player Micheala Dampies has noticed the difference: “It’s been proven that it’s very important, especially in our junior girls who are currently in high school and primary school. I can see that it’s benefited them so much. You can see the joy and the happiness, and the change in the girls’ attitude since they started.” Cathy, 17, is one such player to have benefitted from the organisation. Having grown up playing with her brothers, she joined Badgers earlier this year after being introduced at school. Now a striker in their junior side, she has thrived at the club: “It has helped a lot because when you think of soccer, in general, you think of just boys playing. I only played with boys because I couldn’t find any girls’ soccer teams. So, I think being in my first official women’s team has helped a lot. It’s given me a space to connect with other ladies.” While having a significant effect on younger girls, Badgers have had a huge impact on their adult members as well, providing opportunities to learn a new sport, building fitness and offering social interaction. Romaney, Micheala, and Sarah Wallace have all felt their self-esteem grow as they develop their skills. As Sarah highlights: “Soccer, and Badgers specifically, has honestly changed my life. I am so much happier and so much more at ease with myself because of it … Badgers has created an incredibly welcoming space, no matter who you are. It’s been incredible to be a part of this very welcoming community because that’s what Badgers is. It’s amazing to feel a part of something bigger that’s doing such great things for women and girls in Cape Town.” What’s next for Romaney and her Badgers team? Well, there is certainly no resting on their laurels. Off the pitch, they continue to fundraise to provide more for women and girls in their area, including looking at transport offers and food. On the pitch, Romaney has her eyes on creating a surprise in their new league: “I would love to see us excel. We’re coming in as the underdogs. We’re a very mixed level. Let’s see how that goes. There’s such a joy of being the underdog. Everyone expects nothing. So maybe we come home with a trophy, if not this season maybe next season, and then we’re all going to lose our minds.” Brawls, goals and more records fall: There was no shortage of drama on and off the pitch as old rivals Lyon and PSG came face to face in the Champions League. Not for the first time this year has trouble surrounded the PSG squad. Their preparations were marred by reports of in-fighting at the training ground, resulting in Kheira Hamraoui not travelling. They looked to have put their troubles aside when the effervescent Marie-Antoinette Katoto fired them ahead. Lyon rallied to take a 3-2 first-leg lead. Wendie Renard marked her 100th UWCL appearance with a penalty while Catarina Macario pounced on PSG’s mistakes to score twice. Elsewhere Barcelona broke their previous attendance record: 91,648 fans packed into the Camp Nou to watch their side waltz to a 5-1 victory over Wolfsburg. Government-led review announced: The UK government has announced its intention to launch an in-depth review of women’s football this summer. Independently chaired, it will look at all aspects of the sport, from grassroots to elite level. Its findings, to be published by the end of the year, will hope to provide a pathway to closing the gap to the men’s game. England’s Lionesses are set for the biggest moment in their history with a home European Championships on the horizon. It is hoped that this review and hosting a major tournament will provide a springboard forward as the game continues to progress. Romance lives on at Ibrox: Football’s romantic side shone through at Ibrox on Sunday when Nicola Docherty rifled in her side’s third goal. The lifelong Rangers fan could not hide her elation post-match as her side swept aside Aberdeen in front of more than 4,400 spectators. “I find it really hard to sum up my emotions. I’m still absolutely buzzing right now to be honest,” she said. The victory keeps Rangers on course to wrestle the SWPL title away from close neighbours Glasgow City, who have won the league 14 times in a row. Malky Thomson’s side are undefeated with three games to play. They currently hold a healthy lead at the top of the table, but can they hang on to it until 15 May?

4/27/2022,"Steve Bruce will insist that West Bromwich Albion’s players live or have a second home within an hour of the training ground next season but has explained why he will continue to commute from Cheshire. Bruce feels the longer journeys made by a number of his players are having a negative impact. West Brom are 13th in the Championship and Bruce had targeted promotion when he took over as manager in early February with the club sixth. “I have told them all [they all have to be within an hour of the training ground],” Bruce said. “Where we are going to finish in the league is not good enough. I have put forward what I would like to do next year – that is a rebuild of the squad. And the players that are here – along with the ones we bring in – have got to commit. “We have too many people travelling and that cannot be good for you. That is not good for you as a professional. I’ve pointed that out. And going forward that is the way we will look at it. They have been positive towards that change. I think they understand my feelings on it.” Bruce said that having “eight, nine, 10 travelling away” did not help team spirit and that spending hours in a car “catches up with you and probably takes a little bit of your career”. Bruce outlined why he did not feel the need to move too. “[People] are going to throw it at me and say: ‘Are you going to relocate?’” he said. “But it doesn’t work with us, when we sign a contract we usually get sacked. “For the players it’s difficult. You can have an apartment around the area. But you have to be here the majority of the week.”",Sport/Football,Steve Bruce insists West Brom players live close to training – as he stays in Cheshire,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/27/steve-bruce-insists-west-bromwich-albion-players-live-close-to-training-as-he-stays-in-cheshire
4/27/2022,"1. OK, I was wrong: I really thought Musk was bullshitting. But he is, as tech analyst Benedict Evans puts it, “a bullshitter who delivers”. He doesn’t care if things are true when he says them, but sometimes makes them true anyway. 2. We can file “I’m going to buy Twitter for $54.20” alongside “I’ll sell a flamethrower”, “I’ll start a tunnelling business called the Boring Company”, and “I’ll call my baby X Æ A-12” as things that didn’t sound sincere but apparently were. 3. What next for Twitter, though? I think it’s still the case that the model for Musk is “billionaire buying a sports team” rather than “billionaire investing in a high-yielding asset” – but his bankers will be demanding a return. 4. That means limited scope to make fundamental changes. For all he discussed in now-deleted tweets about removing adverts and improving the subscription offering, those things cost money, and he needs to boost Twitter’s profit, not shrink it. 5. So the changes we should expect fall into two camps: minor tweaks demanded by a notorious power user – and shifts in matters of principle, which are free to make and only likely to affect the bottom line in diffuse ways. 6. On the former, Twitter has already built an edit button that it could enable at the flick of a switch. He’s also talked of “authenticating all humans”, likely by offering the “verified” label to anyone who wants to send in proof of ID. 7. As for the matters of principle, Musk has been clear: “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.” 8. There are obvious high profile changes he could order – chief among them demanding the reinstatement of Donald Trump’s account (though the former president has said he doesn’t want to come back). 9. Musk could also fiddle with Twitter’s terms of service. Perhaps a man who famously called the Covid panic “dumb”, sued to avoid lockdowns and said he wouldn’t get vaccinated might oppose bans on Covid misinformation, for instance. 10. But most free speech controversies happen at the coal face of a moderation queue, where a part-time owner (remember, Musk still owns and runs SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, and the Boring Company) is unlikely to spend much time. 11. So expect the free-speech push to largely happen at the level of extravagant public interventions over high-profile cases. If you’re famous enough that your Twitter ban catches Musk’s attention, you might have a good shot at a reversal. 12. Musk has also suggested that “the twitter algorithm” needs to be made open source. This might happen quickly, but I don’t think it’s likely to affect much: random chunks of computer code being published that refer to other bits of code that haven’t been published tells us … nothing? 13. And while he wants Twitter to be a free-speech platform, the direction of travel is against him, especially overseas. What is he going to do when Twitter’s lawyers tell him about the UK’s Online Safety Act, which requires all sorts of content moderation? Or Germany’s NetzDG? 14. Or, for that matter, China. As the Wall Street Journal’s Mike Forsythe points out, Twitter is now owned by someone with major manufacturing and sales dependencies in the PRC. What happens if Musk is quietly told to dox a Chinese dissident or see Teslas banned from sale? 15. And so people are leaving Twitter. Not in their millions, yet, but certainly in their thousands. As a very unscientific datapoint: I’ve lost 30 followers since the acquisition was confirmed. Even scaled up to the whole platform, that’s not enough to worry Twitter, yet, but it’s telling. 16. The question is, where does a Twitter power user go? The popular answer seems to be Mastodon, a decentralised, “federated” clone of Twitter that is spread over thousands of volunteer-run instances, each of which can interact with each other, or not, as they see fit. 17. “Since August 2018 I have run a social network site called Friend Camp for about 50 of my friends,” writes Darius Kazemi, the creator of one such Mastodon instance. “I think Friend Camp is a really nice place … and I’d like to see more places like Friend Camp on the internet.” 18. Personally, I like Mastodon in theory, but in practice, I fear fragmenting a Twitter-style social network over untold instances feels a bit too much like responding to Microsoft putting adverts in Windows by recommending Linux on the desktop. 19. Others have mooted Tumblr, which is darkly humorous because a huge chunk of Tumblr’s power users moved over to Twitter in 2017 after an unpopular acquisition led to changes in moderation that were disliked by some of the site’s loudest communities. Turn the volume up, Elton John. 20. I don’t think it’s possible for a site to be both a replacement for Twitter, and a healthy social network, because I no longer think it’s possible for a healthy social network to exist that connects the world. 21. “A lot of the internet is 10,000 people bullying someone who deserves to be bullied by maybe 1 to 3 people” has become a foundational piece of social network analysis for me, and it’s not clear how Musk owning Twitter makes that worse, nor how decentralised replacements fix that. 22. But back to Musk. What should we look out for in the weeks to come? First is a staff exodus at Twitter. Not (just) because he’s as hated as he is loved, but because going private changes, and likely reduces, the compensation for people who used to get paid in part in stock options. 23. Second is a gentle tap on the brakes of some of the site’s more controversial moderation decisions. Some high-profile bans will be rescinded, some phrases will disappear from Twitter’s terms of service, but the day-to-day experience will take much longer to shift. 24. In the mid-to-long term, I wonder if there’s cause for optimism. The story of Twitter over the last decade has been of a site stuck in a fundamental disconnect between its incredible socio-cultural importance, and the underperforming business that owns and runs it. 25. For the first time, Twitter is owned by someone who thinks the most important part of the site is the conversation, not the adverts that are delivered in between. Maybe he’ll ruin everything, but at least he’s focusing on the right thing.

4/27/2022,"Good morning. Russia has been accused of seeking to blackmail Europe as the energy company Gazprom confirmed it had halted gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, prompting crisis talks in capitals across the continent. In a statement, the Russian supplier said today it acted in response to the failure by the two EU countries to make their payments in roubles. “Gazprom has completely suspended gas supplies to Bulgargaz and PGNiG due to absence of payments in roubles,” a statement issued by the company said. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, condemned the move, saying that fellow EU countries would come to Poland and Bulgaria’s aid. She said: “The announcement by Gazprom that it is unilaterally stopping delivery of gas to customers in Europe is yet another attempt by Russia to use gas as an instrument of blackmail. When do experts think the war in Ukraine will be over? Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, has said the west was gearing up to help Ukraine for “the long haul” and would take steps to increase rearmament to the embattled country after a meeting of defence ministers in Germany. What else is happening? Here is what we know on day 63 of the invasion. Investors have wiped $126bn (£100bn) off Tesla’s value amid concern that Elon Musk may have to sell shares in the electric carmaker to fund his personal contribution to his $44bn acquisition of Twitter. Tesla stock has been targeted despite the company not being involved in the bid but Musk, its chief executive and largest shareholder, is part-funding the Twitter deal with $21bn of his own equity and a further $12.5bn loan secured against his Tesla stake. The 12.2% drop in Tesla’s shares yesterday equated to a $21bn drop in the value of his Tesla stake, equal to the cash stake he committed to the Twitter deal. Dan Ives, an analyst at the financial firm Wedbush Securities, said worries about expected stock sales by Musk and the possibility he was becoming distracted by the Twitter venture were weighing on the electric carmaker’s shares. “This [is] causing a bear festival on the name,” he said. What else is behind the drop? The share fall took place against a backdrop of difficult trading for tech stocks. The Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since December 2020 on Tuesday, as investors worried about slowing global growth and more aggressive rate increases from the US Federal Reserve. As inflation shot to a new peak in March, cost increases exacted a deep toll on the economy, eating into most Americans’ wages and further imperiling those who are financially vulnerable. But for many of the US’s largest companies and their shareholders it has been a very different story, writes Tom Perkins. One widely accepted narrative holds that companies and consumers are sharing in inflationary pain, but a Guardian analysis of top corporations’ financials and earnings calls shows most are enjoying profit increases even as they pass on costs to customers, many of whom are struggling to afford gas, food, clothing, housing and other basics. The analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission filings for 100 US corporations found net profits up by a median of 49%, and in some individual cases by as much as 111,000%. Those increases came as companies saddled customers with higher prices and all but 10 carried out large stock buyback programs or bumped dividends to enrich investors. Economists who reviewed the data say it is more evidence of a clear reality: consumers are taking a financial hit as companies and shareholders profit or are largely shielded. Researchers have cast an unprecedented light on crimes believed to have been widely committed by Bashar al-Assad’s regime at the height of the Syrian war but always denied, or blamed on rebel groups and jihadists. This is the story of how two academics hunted down a Syrian war criminal. Aung San Suu Kyi has been sentenced to five years in prison after she was found guilty of corruption by a court in military-controlled Myanmar, the latest in a series of legal cases condemned as an attempt to remove her as a political threat. Myanmar’s former leader, 76, has been detained since a military coup in February last year. A dramatic drop in Covid-19 testing has left the world blind to the virus’s continuing rampage and its potentially dangerous mutations, the head of the World Health Organization has warned. “When it comes to a deadly virus, ignorance is not bliss,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Leading former diplomats, including seven ex-UK foreign and defence ministers, have said the Iran nuclear talks are heading to “corrosive stalemate devolving into a cycle of increased nuclear tension” and urged Tehran and Washington to show more flexibility. Harvard University is setting aside $100m for an endowment fund and other measures to close the educational, social and economic gaps that are legacies of slavery and racism, according to an email the university’s president sent to all students, faculty and staff yesterday. The email from Lawrence Bacow, included a link to a 100-page report on Harvard and the legacy of slavery and acknowledged that the elite institution “helped to perpetuate … racial oppression and exploitation”. Can a company really use computer monitoring tools – known as “bossware” to critics – to tell if you’re productive at work? Or if you’re about to run away to a competitor with proprietary knowledge? Or even, simply, if you’re happy? Many companies in the US and Europe now appear – controversially – to want to try, spurred on by the enormous shifts in working habits during the pandemic, in which many office jobs moved home and seem set to stay there or become hybrid. Southern California officials declared a water shortage emergency yesterday, and introduced unprecedented restrictions on outdoor watering that will affect millions of people living in Los Angeles, Ventura and San Bernardino counties. Metropolitan water district of southern California’s resolution will limit outdoor watering to just one day a week for district residents supplied by a depleted system of canals, pipelines, reservoirs and hydroelectric power plants.

4/27/2022,"Barely a day after it opened, Barcelona’s smallest lending library has been forced to close after it was attacked by vandals. Barcelona’s last surviving telephone booth, which has been converted into a miniature book exchange, information centre and mobile charging point, opened on Saturday, when Catalans celebrate their patron Saint Jordi (Saint George) by exchanging gifts of books and roses. Two days later the damage was being repaired after vandals painted the booth with graffiti and stole the small screen displaying information about local events. “We expect those responsible to pay for these intolerable and unjustifiable acts,” Jaume Collboni, the deputy mayor said. “There is no place for vandalism in Barcelona.” The classic glass box booth, the last of its kind in the city, was remodelled and installed outside the civic centre in Sant Genís dels Agudells on the north-west edge of the city. Using a code available on request from the civic centre, citizens gain access via a keypad to the booth’s 200 books while at the same time charging their mobiles. The booth is ventilated and at its inauguration was said to be both vandal- and graffiti-proof. It was moved from its original location nearby to the Plaça Meguidó, close to the Casa Groga civic centre that manages it. The miniature library is expected to reopen soon. Spain’s first public telephone was installed in the Retiro park in Madrid over 100 years ago but this year Telefónica, the company responsible, plans to remove the 14,824 that remain in the country, 500 of them in Barcelona. Mobile phones have made them redundant and Telefónica estimates that it costs €4.5m (£3.8m) a year to maintain the network, despite a study by the Spanish stock exchange commission published last year that found that only 1% of Spaniards had used a public telephone in the previous year and on average only one call a week is made from public phone boxes.

4/27/2022,"One day when she was 12 years old and still new to the ways of remembering the dead, Ana Isabel Bustamante took a photograph from the wardrobe where her mother kept her dark clothes and her most precious things. Ana set the picture on a small table in the living room, where it remained for two days. On the third day, unable to look at the young, bearded face in the photo any longer, her mother put it back in the wardrobe. The man in the picture was Ana’s father, Emil Bustamante López, a veterinarian, sociologist and political activist who was arrested in Guatemala City on 13 February 1982. Emil never made it to the family party for which his wife was making a cake that day. Nor did he ever meet Ana, his younger daughter, who was born eight months later. Instead, he became one of the 40,000 people who were forcibly disappeared during Guatemala’s 36-year civil war. Four decades after he vanished, his family has filed a case with the UN human rights committee, a panel of independent experts that monitors countries’ compliance with the international covenant on civil and political rights. It is the first time the committee has been asked to look into a case of enforced disappearance in Guatemala. Although she never knew her father, Ana’s life – like those of her mother, Rosa María, and her sister, Flora – has been ineluctably shaped by his disappearance. After Emil went missing, Rosa María grabbed Flora and fled to Mexico, where Ana was born and where they lived until she was four. While Rosa María did everything she could to protect herself and her daughters from physical harm, there was little she could do to protect all three of them from the psychological fallout of losing a loved one to forced disappearance: the anger; the grief; the desolation, and the terrible, endless not knowing. “There’s no linear grieving process with forced disappearances,” says Ana, a film-maker who has lived in Spain for the past 12 years. “As long as there’s the possibility that the person could still be alive – although you know they aren’t – as long as there’s no body or no grave, you can’t finish the grieving process. You move forward and then back, forward and then back.” Four years ago, Ana released a film called La asfixia (Suffocation), in which she chronicled her attempts to get to know her father and find out what happened when he was disappeared at the age of 32. As she searched for traces of him in photos, videos, letters, her mother’s memories and the old family home, she discovered both the extent of her father’s secret involvement with the communist Guatemalan Labour party and the scale of her mother’s suffering and resilience. “I wanted to show the feelings that arrests and forced disappearances bring about in family members,” says Ana. “I wanted to show the fight my mother has had to put up; I wanted to stress what she and so many other women have been forced to go through because people have said, ‘If you don’t look for your disappeared loved one, then you’re complicit’. But if you did look for them they called you a communist.” During the seven years it took her to make the film, Ana examined her own feelings of abandonment and the wider psychological consequences of a conflict that claimed 200,000 lives and involved acts of genocide perpetrated against Guatemala’s indigenous Mayan population. “Forced disappearances create an island of inner pain,” says Ana. “You’re too afraid to talk about the disappeared victim and so you can’t find any support groups. And that leaves you alone with your pain.” Ana and her family know the UN investigation will be a long, slow process. They also know that the chances of learning exactly what happened to Emil are slight, as is the likelihood of finding his body. “I’d love to find a grave and for his remains to be there. Then I’d be able to say, ‘Here he is. This happened’. But it’s very complicated as they did such a good job of making sure the victims wouldn’t reappear.” The aim of filing the case to the UN committee is to remind people what happened in Guatemala and to make them understand that the decades of violence didn’t draw to a neat end with the signing of the peace accords in 1996. Although the former Guatemalan dictator Efraín Ríos Montt was found guilty of genocide in May 2013, the conviction was swiftly overturned by the country’s constitutional court, and the impunity continues to this day. “I want people to know about what happened in Guatemala because it’s still very unknown,” says Ana. “I want people to know about it and for them to understand the scale of the horror of the arrests and forced disappearances: the victims aren’t just the people who disappeared; they’re also the families who are left behind and left broken. The living are also victims.” Teresa Fernández Paredes, human rights adviser at the World Organisation Against Torture – which is helping the family with the UN case – says the collapse of the rule of law and attacks on judicial independence under Guatemala’s current president, Alejandro Giammattei, mean those seeking justice have little choice but to look beyond the country’s borders. “The prospects for the families of the more than 40,000 identified victims of forced disappearance are very bleak,” says Fernández. “The only hope at this stage lies with the international community, particularly with the case of Ana Bustamante and her family that is now before the UN Human Rights Committee. The victims of the armed conflict are still asking for justice. They deserve to find their relatives, to bury and mourn them.” Whether she ever finds her father’s body, Ana feels her investigations have at least brought her closer to the man she never met. She now knows the answer to the question she once asked her mother as a little girl: “Did my dad go away because he didn’t want to meet me?” Until she made Suffocation, she had always assumed that accounts of her dad were more than a little hagiographical. “I thought that was just people speaking nicely of the dead; I thought he had to have had his flaws,” she says. “After all, he’d hidden stuff from my mother and he’d left me – so he couldn’t have been so great. But I discovered that he was a wonderful, caring and committed man. I also found out about the beautiful love story he had with my mother, which I’d had no idea about. It also led me to understand my mother’s pain – a pain she has never overcome.”",News/World news,"Disappeared: a daughter’s 40-year search for her father, taken by Guatemala’s military dictatorship ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/emil-bustamante-lopez-disappeared-guatemala-military-dictatorship
