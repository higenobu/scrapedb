1/30/2022,"Andrew Hudson had nervous breakdowns after working an ICU for 19 months during COVID. Hudson posted a video explaining why he quit and it went viral, with half a million views on Twitter. He said he's happier podcasting and creating art, and encourages other nurses to quit. Before nursing school, Andrew Hudson worked at a bar for five years where he became familiar with the smell of Tito's vodka. In early 2020, as Hudson treated COVID-19 patients in a step-down unit at a major Detroit hospital, he noticed his hand sanitizer smelled like booze. He looked down at the packaging saw a Tito's label. At the time, the US allowed distillers to make ethanol-based sanitizers due to a nationwide supply shortage crippling healthcare's pandemic response. Hudson laughed as he recounted the ironic twist of fate, but said these kind of federal stop-gap measures and the overall lack of support he and other nurses received led to burnout and mental health distress in his nearly two years as a COVID ICU nurse. Hudson said he did not receive any hazard pay working between March 2020 and December 2021 as an ICU nurse in Michigan and Colorado. He re-used masks and gowns, and sent his patients' bodies to freezer trucks outside of his hospital. By the end of his tenure in the ICU, Hudson came home from shifts in nervous breakdowns. Hudson finally quit nursing in December 2021, in a now-viral video that has half a million views on Twitter. Hudson said helping patients for months without proper staff and equipment ""feels like emptying the ocean with a bucket."" ""The way it is right now isn't normal,"" he said in an interview with Insider, ""and I don't think it's helping patients in any way."" Hudson's first few months treating patients with COVID were a whirlwind. His team would experiment with the now-debunked treatment hydroxychloroquine because, back then, no clinician knew for sure how to treat the disease. With his voice low, Hudson recalled calling 30 rapid responses in 2020 when his own patients went into a critical level, and many more for other nurses' patients. In the early months, Hudson bagged up dead patients and brought them to the morgue — and sometimes freezer trucks brought to hospitals to store bodies when death rates were over 100 per week in Michigan — several times a night. What's worse, to protect morticians from exposure, Hudson gauzed and taped the eyelids, nostrils, and mouth of his dead patients. ""It felt macabre,"" he said. ""It was pretty grim to look at and I felt like this feels kind of medieval in a way."" In 2021, Hudson moved to a small hospital in Denver treating underserved communities. He was again met with treating mostly COVID ICU patients due to the Delta variant. Due to staffing challenges, Hudson said he cared for at least three patients at once. Safe staffing laws in Massachusetts recommend nurses care for just one ICU patients at once, and research from the University of Pennsylvania finds the more patients a nurse must care for, the worse care becomes. Hudson's hospital hired travel nurses and newly graduated students to help on ICU floors, but their lack of experience wasn't enough to help manage the pandemic's toll. Last year also brought out aggression from patients he hadn't seen before. Patients' families would tell Hudson not to intubated dying patients and instead give them the ivermectin, a parasite killer that does not work against COVID-19. ""We just feel like we've vanished, like we can't do anything,"" he added. Shortly before leaving his job, Hudson recalled coming home from his shifts feeling defeated. Hudson said he became a nurse to help people and make a living wage out of it. In the last two years, he felt he was no longer making a reasonable wage for the unprecedented amount of work he did, and felt no matter how hard he tried to help, his patients would continue to die. Hudson handed in his letter of resignation in the second week of December. Though he felt bad for his manager, he does not regret his decision. ""It was kind of the wild west,"" he said. ""The units were a mess. We didn't have the resource as we need."" After spending some time with his family over the holidays, Hudson threw himself into hobbies: a comedy podcast he co-hosts with his friends, called E1 Podcast, and digital art. He said he'll use some time to ""decompress"" due to the stress of the past two years. Hudson has a message for other fed up healthcare workers: quit. ""I'm encouraging healthcare workers, not just nurses, if you can leave your job, I think you should,"" he said. ""I think that they should see that they need us more than we need them. And the system is already collapsed, but now they're gonna have to deal with the ramifications of that collapse.""

1/30/2022,"Ex-Fox News host Gretchen Carlson slammed her former network, saying “there’s a big difference between having a conservative opinion and having one that supports conspiracy theories.” “Conservative television news is certainly not the conservative news that was out there even just five years ago,” Carlson told CNN’s Jim Acosta on Thursday. “Slowly but surely, this has morphed into eradicating any other point of view since the Trump era that is not just opinion,” said Carlson, who left Fox in 2016. She reportedly received a $20 million settlement over sexual harassment allegations against then-CEO Roger Ailes. “It’s gone from an opinion, which was fine, to completely devolving into non-fact-based conspiracy theories and outright dangerous rhetoric, in my mind, and I think it’s a complete disservice to our country,” she told Acosta. “This is not going to end well, in my mind,” Carlson added.

1/30/2022,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A pregnant New Zealand journalist says she turned to the Taliban for help and is now stranded in Afghanistan after her home country has prevented her from returning due to a bottleneck of people in its coronavirus quarantine system. In a column published in The New Zealand Herald on Saturday, Charlotte Bellis said it was “brutally ironic” that she'd once questioned the Taliban about their treatment of women and she was now asking the same questions of her own government. “When the Taliban offers you — a pregnant, unmarried woman — safe haven, you know your situation is messed up,” Bellis wrote in her column. New Zealand's COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins told the Herald his office had asked officials to check whether they followed the proper procedures in Bellis's case, “which appeared at first sight to warrant further explanation.” New Zealand has managed to keep the spread of the virus to a minimum during the pandemic and has reported just 52 virus deaths among its population of 5 million. But the nation's requirement that even returning citizens spend 10 days isolating in quarantine hotels run by the military has led to a backlog of thousands of people wanting to return home vying for spots. Stories of citizens stranded abroad in dire circumstances have caused embarrassment for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and her government, but Bellis's situation is particularly striking. Last year, she was working for Al Jazeera covering the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan when she gained international attention by questioning Taliban leaders about their treatment of women and girls. In her column Saturday, Bellis said she returned to Qatar in September and discovered she was pregnant with her partner, freelance photographer Jim Huylebroek, a contributor to The New York Times. She described the pregnancy as a “miracle” after earlier being told by doctors she couldn't have children. She is due to give birth to a girl in May. Extramarital sex is illegal in Qatar and Bellis said she realized she needed to leave. She repeatedly tried to get back to New Zealand in a lottery-style system for returning citizens but without success. She said she resigned from Al Jazeera in November and the couple moved to Huylebroek's native Belgium. But she couldn't stay long, she said, because she wasn't a resident. She said the only other place the couple had visas to live was Afghanistan. Bellis said she spoke with senior Taliban contacts who told her she would be fine if she returned to Afghanistan. “Just tell people you’re married and if it escalates, call us. Don’t worry,” Bellis said they told her. She said she sent 59 documents to New Zealand authorities in Afghanistan but they rejected her application for an emergency return. Chris Bunny, the joint head of New Zealand's Managed Isolation and Quarantine system, told the Herald that Bellis's emergency application didn't fit a requirement that she travel within 14 days. He said staff had reached out to Bellis about making another application that would fit within the requirements. “This is not uncommon and is an example of the team being helpful to New Zealanders who are in distressing situations,” Bunny wrote. Bellis said that pregnancy can be a death sentence in Afghanistan because of the poor state of maternity care and lack of surgical capabilities. She said that after talking to lawyers, politicians and public relations people in New Zealand, her case seems to be moving forward again, although she has yet to be approved passage home.",World/Associated Press,"Rejected by New Zealand, reporter turns to Taliban for help",https://news.yahoo.com/rejected-zealand-reporter-turns-taliban-085951441.html
