1/26/2022,"Experts have warned against the “unproven” and “unethical” use of genetic tests to predict the risk of complex diseases in embryos created through IVF. Though not currently available in the UK, such tests are being marketed in the US and their availability is likely to increase as the technology develops, representatives from the European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) said.  Writing in the European Journal of Human Genetics, they stressed that there is currently no evidence that the technique called polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis can predict the likelihood of as yet unborn children being at risk of complex diseases such as schizophrenia, type 2 diabetes or breast cancer in later life. The geneticists also called for a societal debate about the future application of such tests, such as selecting for traits like height or intelligence. “We believe that this is a highly promising field in genetics and for the prevention of disease, but at the [present] stage, it cannot be used,” said the ESHG president, Maurizio Genuardi, a professor of medical genetics at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome. “There is no evidence that this kind of selection can lead to better or healthier babies.” Unlike genetic testing for Down’s syndrome or diseases such as cystic fibrosis that are caused by mutations in a single gene, PRS aims to calculate an individual’s susceptibility to complex traits or disorders by combining the effects of dozens or potentially millions of genetic variants into a single figure. It involves analysing cells from embryos created through IVF, before they are implanted. “Many conditions are caused by a combination of genetics and environment, and PRSs are only able to capture parts of any of the relevant genetic component, which is itself likely to be highly complex and difficult to analyse,” said Dr Francesca Forzano, the chair of the ESHG public and professional policy committee and a consultant in clinical genetics at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS foundation trust in London. Even so, private testing companies are increasingly marketing such tests to prospective parents as a means of selecting embryos with a lower risk of disease in later life. At least one child has been born after such a procedure, Forzano and colleagues said. Although US companies are leading the charge, “we do not really have a very good sense of what is happening in each individual private clinic across Europe and other countries,” said Forzano. Sarah Norcross, the director of the Progress Educational Trust (PET), a charity that improves choices for people affected by infertility and genetic conditions, called on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to clarify the legal and regulatory status of such tests within the UK, and said the Advertising Standards Authority and Competition and Markets Authority should keep a careful eye on whether and how such tests are marketed to UK patients. “PET supports this clear and unequivocal warning to fertility patients not to waste their money on having embryos tested using polygenic risk scores,” she said. “Even if – for the sake of argument, and despite a complete lack of clinical evidence – a polygenic risk score could meaningfully predict certain things about certain embryos, the sheer number of embryos that would be needed to make use of this test could not be achieved in a clinical setting. “There are precious few embryos to choose from in a fertility treatment context, and so reasons for preferring one embryo over another must be grounded in clear evidence.” The ESHG also called for a societal debate about the future application of PRS, to avoid discrimination and the stigmatisation of certain conditions. “If, theoretically, we are going to offer a test to select common traits, for which traits would our society consider it is ethical to offer?” said Forzano. “We need to consider whether we think that this is acceptable, whether it is ethical, and whether our society really wants to have something like that.”",News/Society,‘Unproven and unethical’: experts warn against genetic embryo tests,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/25/unproven-and-unethical-experts-warn-against-genetic-embryo-tests
1/26/2022,"The US has helped prepare for the diversion of natural gas supplies from around the world to Europe in the event that the flow from Russia is cut, in a bid to blunt Vladmir Putin’s most powerful economic weapon. As fears of an invasion of Ukraine have grown, US officials said on Tuesday that they have been negotiating with global suppliers, and they are now confident that Europe would not suffer from a sudden loss of energy for heating in the middle of winter.  Russia has already restricted the flow of natural gas through the pipeline running through Ukraine from about about 100 million cubic metres a day to 50 MCM, US officials said. Washington now estimates that almost all of that can be replaced quickly if the pipeline is cut deliberately or as a result of conflict. “To ensure Europe is able to make it through the winter and spring we expect to be prepared to ensure alternative supplies covering a significant majority of the potential shortfall,” a senior official said. Fears that Putin would cut off gas supplies have made some European countries, such as Germany, wary of imposing sanctions on Putin if he proceeds with an invasion. The Biden administration also insists that US and European financial sanctions plans are converging, and that the US is preparing export controls on western technology which would cripple Putin’s efforts to diversify his economy. The impact would be far greater than the response to the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea, a senior official said. “The gradualism of the past is out, and this time we’ll start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there,” the official said. US discussions with Qatar have been widely reported, but the administration said the discussions have been global. “The conversation is really broad, with a lot of companies and countries around the world. It’s not centered on one or two suppliers,” an official said. “And by doing that you don’t need to ask any one individual company or country to surge exports by significant volumes, but rather smaller volumes from a multitude of sources.” The US also said it is preparing restrictions on exports to Russia of hi-tech software and hardware made by the US and its allies. Officials said the measures would affect Russian ambitions in the fields of aerospace, defence, lasers and sensitive, maritime technology, artificial intelligence and quantum computers. “When we pick these sectors, it’s quite deliberate,” an official said. “These are sectors that Putin himself has, has championed, as the way forward for Russia to diversify its economy beyond oil and gas. And so that would lead to an atrophying of Russia’s productive capacity over time.”",News/US news,US finalizing plans to divert gas to Europe if Russia cuts off supply,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/25/us-europe-russia-gas-supplies-energy
1/26/2022,"Is the office dead? Or have rumours of its death been greatly exaggerated? The pandemic has already spawned a million think pieces on the subject. Now that Boris Johnson has dropped work-from-home guidance and some big companies are starting to tell staff to come back in, brace yourself for a gazillion more. If you don’t have time to navigate the debate, here’s a handy summary: the future of work looks very different depending on who you ask. People who have spent the pandemic Zooming from spacious holiday homes, and those with a financial stake in remote work, seem to be adamant that the days of trudging to an office are over. People with a financial stake in commercial real estate and ancillary industries, meanwhile, have been working overtime extolling the virtues of in-person work.  One big proponent of the “offices are for ever” crowd is an architect called Clive Wilkinson who (this will shock you) designs office spaces. Not just any office spaces, mind you: Wilkinson is the guy responsible for Google’s fancy headquarters in California. He’s got some regrets about the Googleplex now: in a recent interview with NPR, Wilkinson admitted that too many on-site perks can be “dangerous” because employees never have any reason to leave the office. Still, Wilkinson said the office may need to be reimagined but that doesn’t mean it’s dead. “The office is the fermenting ground for people growing into successful adults,” he opined. “How would that ever be dead?” I’m not going to answer that. I’m just going to say his thoughts on the matter may have fermented a little too long. Meanwhile, on the other extreme of the debate, is Brian Chesky, Airbnb’s CEO and a man who clearly hasn’t spent the last two years quietly weeping as he tries to get work done while living in a one-bedroom flat with a very loud baby, a hyperactive dog and another adult who is also trying to get work done. (I’m not projecting here; not projecting at all.) Last week Chesky announced that he will be working remotely as he hops from Airbnb to Airbnb around the world. Why? Well, because he’s a billionaire and he can. And also, as he explained on Twitter, because he reckons this is the future: remote work has “untethered many people (obviously not everyone, but a large chunk) from the need to be in an office every day.” Per Chesky, that means “more people will start living abroad … and [becoming] digital nomads”. Which, of course, is great news for Airbnb. Airbnb-hopping as you work from the beach sounds lovely, right? But let’s remember that the people who can do this may be a lucrative customer base for Airbnb but can’t, by any means, be described as a “large chunk” of the population. It’s important to stress that point because it can be easy for those of us who have been lucky enough to work remotely during the pandemic to overestimate how many people have had the same opportunity. Last September, the Atlantic commissioned a poll asking Americans to estimate how many people had worked from home during the pandemic. Seventy-three per cent of the respondents who had worked remotely guessed at least half of Americans had done the same. In reality, the number of Americans who worked remotely was only 35% at its highest point (May 2020). Only 13.4% were working from home by the end of last summer. The numbers seem to be higher in Britain (47% of people worked from home in April 2020) but we’re still not talking about an overwhelming majority here. And this, really, is the key issue when it comes to the whole remote v in-person work conversation. Far too much airtime is given to the experiences of a relatively small proportion of the population; every other type of worker seems to be invisible. There may be a lot of grand ideas about the “future of work” floating around, but there’s nothing futuristic about fixating on how to improve the lives of white-collar workers while ignoring everyone else. That’s just business as usual.  Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Unsure about returning to the office?

1/26/2022,"Alan Cumming will play Scotland’s national bard Robert Burns this summer in a solo show that will delve beyond “the traditional biscuit tin image” of the great poet. Burn, a dance-theatre production, was announced on Tuesday amid preparations for the evening’s traditional Burns suppers celebrating the poet’s birthday. It will be staged as part of the 75th Edinburgh international festival (EIF) in August.  Burns, an 18th-century tenant farmer who became an excise collector, wrote passionately about his country in vivid poems and songs including Tam o’ Shanter, Auld Lang Syne and Address to a Haggis, which is recited at commemorative Burns suppers. His work “tells us the absolute truth of who we are as Scots” said Cumming. “But the more I researched him, the more I realised I didn’t know the absolute truth of him.” With Burn, Cumming aims to tell the poet’s story “using my whole body” and he said: “If I have one regret in my artistic life it would be that I did not become a dancer.” The actor will collaborate on the show with the choreographer Steven Hoggett whose productions include Black Watch and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Burn is co-produced by the National Theatre of Scotland, the Joyce theater in New York and EIF, which said the show explores his personal struggles and spectacular successes. Cumming is no stranger to Edinburgh’s annual arts jamboree. He was a roof-raising Dionysus in the National Theatre of Scotland’s production of The Bacchae at the 2007 festival and had a cabaret residency, Alan Cumming Sings Sappy Songs!, in 2016. Towards the end of last year’s festival – which was dramatically scaled down because of Covid – he presented a show called Alan Cumming Is Not Acting His Age. Burn was announced alongside a revival of Liz Lochhead’s contemporary Scots-language adaptation of Euripides’ Medea, which will be directed at EIF by Michael Boyd and will star the actor and playwright Adura Onashile whose play Expensive Shit was staged at the Edinburgh fringe in 2016. Lochhead’s Medea was first staged in Glasgow in 2000 by Theatre Babel. Boyd’s revival starring Onashile had been due at EIF in 2020 but was postponed due to the pandemic. Further programming for this year’s EIF, which runs 5-29 August, will be announced in spring.",Arts/Stage,Alan Cumming to play Robert Burns in solo dance-theatre show,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/25/alan-cumming-robert-burns-edinburgh

Police were called to Walney school in Cumbria after the knife attack at about 10am on Tuesday.  Cumbria constabulary said a 15-year-old boy had suffered “multiple stab woulds” to his body and was taken to Alder Hey hospital by air ambulance. A 16-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent after being detained near Barrow train station at 10.40am, nearly half an hour after police arrived at the school. The force said in a statement: “Police are in attendance at the school and can reassure the public and parents that there is no perceived wider threat.” In a letter to parents, Walney school’s headteacher, John Richardson, said support was available for students affected by the incident. He added: “The whole school community is in shock at these events and all our thoughts and prayers are with the victim and his family. “The school day is now continuing while police officers remain on site as part of their ongoing investigation, which we are of course supporting.”",News/UK news,"Boy, 15, stabbed multiple times at school in Cumbria",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/25/boy-15-stabbed-multiple-times-at-school-in-cumbria
1/26/2022,"Keeping the bedroom window open in the depths of winter, worrying about having a hot flush in parliament and discussing HRT with her doctor: Nicola Sturgeon has spoken frankly in a new podcast about her experience of the menopause. In an interview with the editor and author Sam Baker for The Shift, which explores the challenges in life for women over the age of 40, Scotland’s first minister admitted her own ambivalence about discussing the subject in public.  She said: “We talk about the menopause much more, and I’m very conscious of being a woman with a profile and a platform, a fair degree of influence, so I feel a responsibility – given that I’m at that age – to talk about it myself. “And yet even talking about it like this, I am so far out of my comfort zone, in terms of the intensely personal nature of it. That tells me no matter how far we’ve come in this discussion, we still have a long way to go that somebody like me still feels kind of uncomfortable with it.” Sturgeon, who is 51, described herself as “still in the foothills” of the menopause, adding: “Even though there is more information available than there has ever been before, there’s still a massive amount of guesswork about it. We’re still all feeling our way through it.” She told Baker that she had already had a conversation with her doctor about taking hormone replacement therapy, noting that her generation grew up reading – now discredited – scare stories about the treatment and asking: “How many women just suffered in silence and suffered unnecessarily because of that?” Asked how she might deal with a hot flush during a work meeting, she said: “I would like to think I would be open about it. If you look around the world, there’s not been that many women leaders … I guess Angela Merkel must have gone through when she was in office, Hillary Clinton … so if you’ve got that platform, then I would like to think I would use that positively, but I’m also a human being.” Sturgeon said that while she had not yet experienced those symptoms, she was “definitely at the stage of feeling hotter overnight, not being able to sleep and all that sort of thing”. She added: “So I’ve got windows open in the depth of winter, my poor husband is shivering. I’ve thought to myself: what if that happens when I’m on my feet in parliament in the middle of first minister’s questions? What would I do? That could happen any time. I’m not sure I will know the answer to that question until it happens.” She joked: “Maybe male opposition leaders should be thinking about what I will do, as well.” Last summer, the Scottish government published its first women’s health plan, which included commitments to reduce waiting times for diagnosing endometriosis from more than eight years to less than 12 months, to offer individual care plans after a woman’s first miscarriage, and to widen access to specialist menopause services.",News/Society,"I feel a responsibility to talk about menopause, says Nicola Sturgeon",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/25/i-feel-a-responsibility-to-talk-about-menopause-says-nicola-sturgeon
1/26/2022,"Juventus have reached an agreement with Fiorentina to sign the much-coveted striker Dusan Vlahovic for around €75m (£62.8m). Vlahovic and his agent are holding contract talks with Juventus, subject to which the move is due to go through. The 21-year-old Serbia international, a target for clubs including Arsenal, made clear he would not extend his contract beyond next season, prompting Fiorentina to strike a deal for his transfer this month.  Vlahovic has 17 goals in 21 Serie A appearances this season, making him the league’s joint top scorer with Lazio’s Ciro Immobile. The Juventus striker Álvaro Morata, on loan from Atlético Madrid, hopes Vlahovic’s arrival will enable him to join Barcelona but that would hinge on permission from his parent club and whether Barcelona have the financial capacity to register him. Fiorentina want to sign the Brazilian striker Arthur Cabral from Basel to replace Vlahovic and have submitted an opening bid of €14m plus €2m in add-ons.

1/26/2022,"Yesterday’s announcement of an inquiry into alleged anti-Muslim racism in the government meant I was going to begin with one of the more eye-watering quotes from Boris Johnson’s terrible novel Seventy-Two Virgins. (Seventy-Two Virgins is the title, not who bought it.) But further partygate revelations – and finally a police investigation – instead force me to tong open another work in the Johnson canon: The Churchill Factor. This minimum opus is riddled with sensational factual errors but is meant to advance Johnson’s big theory that we shouldn’t write off great men as “meretricious bubbles on the vast tides of social history”. On the contrary, great men turn history, and he’s one of them. (Johnson, obviously – not Churchill. Britain’s greatest wartime leader is chiefly deployed as a useful proxy for the narcissist author.) It is, then, entirely fitting of Boris Johnson’s historical stature that as Russia stands on the brink of an invasion of Ukraine, the talk is all of the PM’s singalong birthday party during the first lockdown. Has ever a meretricious bubble been more in need of a pin? A vast tide of something is flowing out of Downing Street, but it doesn’t smell like history.  Needless to say, that isn’t the line Johnson’s few remaining allies are going with. Sent out into no-man’s land this morning, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, claimed that what people were really concerned about was the genuinely serious situation in Ukraine. Sorry, but no. This populist government can’t have it both ways. You can’t forever claim to be the voice of the people, and then claim that what the people are really worried about are Russian troop manoeuvres on the Ukraine border. I’m afraid that is just total bollocks. “The people” are not talking about that very much at all. Whether the cabinet and other serious folk reckon they should be is a separate matter – but it’s a little too late for coulda-woulda-shoulda from an administration that has spent the past two and a half years stoking every single trivial and diversionary culture war that it possibly could. Go to the pub, go online, stand at the school gates. What the people are actually doing their nuts about is the endless revelations of Downing Street partying. Such is life? Such has this government made it. Anyway, a recap on the latest party, which took place in June 2020 in the cabinet room and involved a birthday cake, singing, and 30 guests, including Lulu Lytle, the PM’s interior designer. Clearly, the presence of the personal decorator is the rococo detail that really elevates this tale, although according to her own account, Lulu seems to have been what you might call present but not involved. In all honesty, I can’t help feeling rather sorry for Lytle during the whole saga of the Downing Street flat refurbishment. She is simply a decorator who took a commission, clearly with no understanding that she was working for a couple of greedy chancers who didn’t have a clue how they were going to pay for it, nor particularly cared. Last night’s statement from her firm says Lytle “entered the cabinet room briefly as requested”, and that she was “waiting to speak to the prime minister”. I bet she was. She was probably thinking this was her best chance of asking Johnson if he’d found his lost wallet yet. But I’m afraid that upon receipt of the latest information, we’re going to have to raise the odd question about the dates involved. Here is Lytle’s office last night, confirming that she “was present in Downing Street on 19 June [2020] working on the refurbishment”. And yet, more than five months after that date – on 29 November 2020 – here is Boris Johnson emailing Lord Brownlow that his flat is “a tip” and he is “keen to allow Lulu Lytle to get on with it”. Has some tear opened up in the time-chintz continuum? Can work be under way five months before the prime minister is keen to get it started? It does all serve as a reminder that the flat refurbishment scandal has yet to be got to the bottom of by any of the various Clouseaus who’ve had a crack at it. Then again, it’s just one of a cavalcade of shameful businesses, frequent lies and serial obfuscations that were always the inevitable result of putting Johnson in Downing Street. I wonder if the great political theorists of the Conservative party still want to boast that they are all “priced in” to Johnson’s long-lasting appeal. They are now reduced to “welcoming” criminal investigations into his Downing Street. Meanwhile, the impression that the public were treated like mugs by the overlords who made the rules has become thoroughly overriding. I now have no idea why I couldn’t have had a sixth birthday party for my daughter that same week of Johnson’s gathering. After all, she’d been working in a classroom with her friends all day – what’s the difference if they then all come round to ours/the cabinet room, and carry on with cake there? They’re all in a bubble too, aren’t they? Had I known that Nadine Dorries would have defended me to the hilt, I would have gone ahead and thrown the usual sugarfest. And yet, are we perhaps all on the point of developing a sneaking suspicion that Nadine only defends very important and powerful people who give her jobs at which she’s useless? As for the prime minister’s wife, maybe she just couldn’t bear the look on her big kid’s little face if he was denied his 56th birthday tea. Quite how long Conservative MPs and the wider British public will continue to indulge him is another matter. Realism appears to be getting the upper hand on cakeism. Boris Johnson promises you “global Britain” but in fact makes your country a laughing stock. He promises to level you up but he just drags everything down to his level. He promises you “the people’s government” but you get the Downing Street version of Marie Antoinette’s ridiculous hameau. He tells you that you can have your cake and eat it, but the only one who actually gets cake is him. In the end, Johnsonism is little more than a con trick, and the jig looks increasingly close to being up. Perhaps that is beginning to dawn upon even him. Enemies of the naff will shudder at reports that Johnson has installed a fire pit in the Downing Street garden, but it may well be the only constructive thing he’s ever done. After all, familiarising himself with fiery pits would seem to be an increasingly wise long-term hedge.

1/26/2022,"Boris Johnson will cooperate with a Metropolitan police investigation into alleged lockdown breaches in Downing Street but does not believe he broke the law, his spokesperson said, amid concern over the future of Sue Gray’s internal inquiry. The Met did not raise any objection on Tuesday to the publication of Gray’s report, sources with knowledge of its discussions and actions said. But Johnson’s spokesperson said any publication of the Cabinet Office report was likely to be only partial until the criminal investigation has concluded.  No 10 told reporters it could publish the aspects of her findings that related to gatherings that were not being investigated by the police, while the Met was carrying out its work. “My understanding is that she can publish those elements that are not subject to further work,” the spokesperson said. Speaking to MPs on Tuesday, Johnson said he welcomed the Met’s investigation and that the internal inquiry had involved sharing information. “That process has quite properly involved sharing information continuously with the Metropolitan police, so I welcome the Met’s decision to conduct its own investigation because I believe this will help to give the public the clarity it needs and help to draw a line under matters.” Asked if the prime minister was willing to be questioned by the police, Johnson’s spokesperson said, “anyone asked to will cooperate fully, as you would expect”. Pressed on whether Johnson believes he had broken the law, he replied, “it’s fair to say he does not”. The prime minister had been forewarned about Dick’s announcement, Downing Street conceded, but he did not inform cabinet colleagues, instead using this morning’s cabinet meeting to urge them to, “go further and faster in driving forward the government’s reform agenda”. The news broke during a cabinet meeting after which it emerged Johnson had been told about the impending announcement from the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, but had not told his cabinet. Cabinet ministers do not routinely take phones into the meeting. Asked why cabinet ministers were not told about the police investigation, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “From what I understand it’s important not to pre-empt a police statement on this sort of issue at any point. “That was the judgment the prime minister made. It was at that stage unclear exactly at what point the Met would make that statement and obviously the prime minister will continue to discuss any relevant issues with his cabinet.” The spokesperson added: “I think it’s understandable that, given the sensitive nature of what the Met were due to announce, it’s right that wasn’t pre-empted in any way.” Tory MPs lined up to defend the prime minister’s during an urgent question on the investigation asked by Labour’s Angela Rayner. The Conservative MP Giles Watling described the urgent question as a “vexatious waste of everybody’s time” but was forced to withdraw his claims by the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who decides urgent questions. Sir Edward Leigh said: “When European stands on the brink of war and there is cost of living crisis can we please have a sense of proportion over the prime minister being given a piece of cake in his own office by his own staff.” ITV News reported on Monday night that up to 30 staff gathered in the cabinet room with picnic food from M&S to sing happy birthday to the prime minister and give him birthday cake in June 2020.

1/26/2022,"A consultant psychiatrist was tortured, robbed and left for dead in a city centre park by two men and a teenage girl who were motivated by “greed, homophobia and a straightforward liking of violence”, a jury has heard. Dr Gary Jenkins, 54, had gone to Bute Park in Cardiff seeking “sexual contact” with other men, Merthyr Tydfil crown court was told, when he was subject to the vicious 15-minute attack.  Jason Edwards, Lee William Strickland and a girl who was 16 at the time egged one another on and laughed as they beat Jenkins before stealing his bag and leaving him with his trousers pulled down. During the attack the girl could be heard shouting “Fucking pig. Fucking dick” while Edwards yelled: “Stamp his head. Stamp his head.” Afterwards the girl said “I needed that,” the court heard. Jenkins, a father-of-two, suffered a brain injury and fractures to his face and ribs and died 16 days later. Edwards, 25, Strickland, 36, and the girl, who is now 17 and cannot be named for legal reasons, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter, robbery and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The three deny murder. Dafydd Enoch QC, prosecuting, said the attack was “evil and sadistic” with the defendants “indulging in sport”. He said: “We like to think as human beings we do protect each other. Sadly the man at the centre of this case encountered the worst traits of humankind. “Dr Jenkins was in the habit of attending Bute Park at night looking for sexual contact with like-minded men. He would often drink heavily as well. “On 20 July last year in the early hours of the morning he was viciously beaten, robbed, tortured and left for dead by these three defendants. It was a beating apparently motivated by greed, homophobia and a straightforward liking of violence.” The court heard Jenkins had met his wife at medical school in London and they had two daughters. He moved to Cardiff after the breakdown of his marriage and went on to explore his bisexuality. He was open about his sexuality but Enoch said: “He was a very easy target as he wandered about Bute Park.” Jenkins left work at 5pm on the night of the attack before going for a meal and a glass of wine. He was later spotted on CCTV buying cigarettes and alcohol before last being seen at 9pm near the park. The court heard the attackers positioned themselves in the park “to target somebody for robbery and violence”. Enoch said: “They were hurting Jenkins for the best part of 15 minutes as he lay on the ground. It was torture pure and simple. Dr Jenkins is heard to be pleading with those people to stop hurting him and he pleads over and over again until he can speak no more.” A passerby, Louis Williams, spotted Jenkins on the floor being kicked. Enoch said: “He went towards them shouting, ‘Stop. Leave him alone.’” The girl was then heard yelling: “Take his bag. Get his bag.” Williams described the three “egging each other on” while laughing during the attack. The court heard Williams said the teenage girl was “confident” and said she thought “everything she was doing was just funny”. Police found Jenkins unconscious with his trousers pulled down. “He had been left in a humiliating state,” said Enoch. The trial continues.
