4/20/2022,"A retelling of The Odyssey, Homer’s epic story of endurance and hope, is to be the centrepiece of a landmark project next year by the National Theatre in partnership with local artists and communities. The production will be staged in episodes in Stoke-on-Trent, Doncaster, Trowbridge and Sunderland. Each of the four parts will be written by a local playwright, and performed by local people alongside professional actors. The fifth and final episode will be a full-scale musical production at the Olivier stage of the National Theatre in London involving hundreds of people from across the UK including cameo performances by groups from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. “It will be logistically very challenging, but thrilling to have people from all over the country on the stage for the final part,” said Emily Lim, director of Public Acts, the NT’s national community initiative, which celebrates its fifth anniversary in 2023. Next year is also the 60th anniversary of the founding of the NT by Laurence Olivier. Lim and her colleagues wanted to stage an “epic, episodic story which would allow us to go on a journey around the country and end back at the National Theatre”, she said. “The Odyssey was one of the most obvious, and we resisted it for a while partly because of that. “But this is a story of endurance, resilience, of overcoming trial upon trial. And of hope, of finding a way of keeping going. In the context of the past two years, this is a pertinent thing to explore. “How do we keep going in the face of a world turned upside down? When everything’s falling apart, how do we look up? Where’s the light? Where’s the hope? Where’s the forward motion? And we find it in each other.” Each episode will be self-contained and “very bespoke”, but part of one larger story, said Lim. “We want to give as much autonomy as possible to the four amazing writers and artistic teams around the country. But we also need to make sure that the story holds as a consistent whole.” All four parts will open with the same prologue, and the same song will be performed with variations in each production. “There will also be something we’re calling ‘passing the baton’ – a community member from each place will travel to the next place to perform as part of that opening. And they will bring with them a gift to the company they’re going to from the company they’ve come from.” An element of the final episode will be a recap of the first four parts. Lim said: “We’d love it if people travelled to see all five episodes, but everything will be available to stream. And each piece can be enjoyed independently.” Lindsay Rodden, who is writing episode four which will be staged in Sunderland, said the project was a “huge undertaking, the absolute opposite of watching something on your phone”. The Sunderland episode will be the stories of Odysseus’ encounter with the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis, and the Cattle of Helios. “These are exciting, dramatic, terrifying tales. People are drawn to huge, epic dramas,” she said. Sunderland Culture and the Sunderland Empire theatre, the NT’s partners, had an “arms wide open” approach, said Rodden. “It’s an invitation: who wants to join in? We have a big beautiful stage, come and help us fill it.” Public Acts was established in 2017 as a participatory theatre programme, with its first production the following year. “Theatre is all about anything being possible,” said Lim. “With something as massive and as epic as this, the show will be a big celebration of who we are and who we can be when we come together as a community of artists.” The first four episodes will be staged in April 2023, with the final episode in August 2023.",Arts/Stage,"National Theatre to stage The Odyssey in ‘epic, episodic’ retelling around UK",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/20/national-theatre-the-odyssey-epic-episodic-retelling-around-uk-2023
4/20/2022,"Dunes are more than just piles of sand blocking the way to a beach. These are some of Britain’s most precious and threatened habitats, a sanctuary for rare plants and wildlife adapted to living in sand, such as fen orchids, natterjack toads and sand lizards.But sand dunes have declined by a third since 1900, under assault from aggressive invading plants such as sea buckthorn, and nitrogen pollution has enriched the poor nutrient soils, driving out native dune plants. The management of dunes has also been bungled by fencing and hedging them in to keep the sand blowing away. That stopped the dunes from moving and shifting, so they became carpeted in grass and scrub; a healthy dune needs open areas of sand that can blow in the wind, with depressions where birds and amphibians can shelter.Dynamic Dunescapes, a huge project run by conservation charities and Natural England, is halfway through rejuvenating nine of the major dune areas in England and Wales.

4/20/2022,"Recently, standup queen Ali Wong announced her separation from her husband of eight years, Justin Hakuta. Sad news for the couple, who have two young daughters. And sad news for uninvolved bystander Randall Park, who, by virtue of having co-starred with Wong in the breakout Netflix romcom Always Be My Maybe, found his face splashed across the internet in breaking-news posts by Parade magazine and MSN – both of which used photos of Park in place of Hakuta. I don’t know what it was like for him on the day the story of Wong’s divorce hit the headlines. I imagine him driving home from a long day of being hilarious on TV, when all of a sudden his phone begins buzzing like a bag of angry hornets. He pulls over and looks at his messages. They’re from concerned friends and relatives, asking what he had to do with the breakup of his close friend and co-star’s marriage. He’s not on Twitter, so he messages back in panic asking for context. And then the phone rings, and it’s his wife, and honey, there’s some ’splainin to do … It’s an unsettling reminder that there can be real-life consequences for those who get randomly hit with the “Sorry, Wrong Asian” stick, which, if you’re Asian – any Asian, every Asian – you’re probably familiar with yourself. Stop me if you’ve heard this one: Uh, I think you’re looking for the other Asian. Not me, you want the person down the hall who looks nothing like me, has a different last and first name, and is Filipino. By the way, I’m Taiwanese. Also, I’m male and she’s female. Easy mistake though. Sometimes the awkward exchange ends with a profuse apology from the person who has mistaken you for Totally Different Asian Person. Sometimes the person insists you’re lying to them (about your own identity!) and stomps away dead mad. Either way, welcome to the club: you’ve just been Sorry Wrong Asianed. It’s embarrassing. It’s dehumanizing. It makes you wonder if the people you work with or hang out with or go to school with ever really pay attention to you as more than just a kind of vague Asian blur. Randall Park didn’t deserve to be blindsided by a random Sorry Wrong Asian barrage from sloppy celebrity media. He’s widely known to be one of the nicest guys in Hollywood – the kind of guy who sees a PA trying to take notes outdoors on a stack of flapping papers and spontaneously leaves the studio to go buy her a clipboard. (I heard this myself from the PA in question, the day it happened.) But then again, none of us deserve it. Because the roots of the Sorry Wrong Asian phenomenon lie in some of the most pernicious stereotypes of Asians – the ones that strip away our individuality and represent us as teeming hordes, as a faceless hive of interchangeable vermin. The ones that erase our unique features and replace them with cartoon signifiers: for some, narrow eyes aligned at a 45-degree angle, black bowl-cut hair, chrome yellow skin. For others, an enigmatic ambiguity that comedian Erick Esteban refers to as “Miscellaneous Brown”. Sorry Wrong Asian is why a rising tide of hostility against any of our diverse communities reverberates across all of us. No one stops to check ethnicity or nationality before cursing, spitting or taking a swing. The “anti-Chinese” hostility of the pandemic era (which, if necessary, I will remind you is still going on) triggered attacks on and harassment of Vietnamese, Hmong, Korean and Filipino Americans. The most infamous episode of anti-Asian American violence in contemporary history, the 1982 killing of Vincent Chin in Detroit, allegedly occurred after the assailants blamed him for the woes Japanese imports had wreaked on the US auto industry, shouting at him that “it’s because of you little motherfuckers that we’re out of work”, before beating him with a baseball bat. Still, despite the ugly history and occasionally horrific consequences of Sorry Wrong Asianing, we tend to do our best to respond with rueful humor when it happens to us (because what else can we do?). I asked fellow Asians to share their most memorable funny-not-funny stories of being confused for other Asians, and here are some of the gems. The flubs are occasionally dumbfounding: “I was mistaken for Margaret Cho in the women’s room of a NYC theatre … while attending a performance by Margaret Cho,” said the podcaster Kristen Meinzer (Korean American, but not resembling Margaret Cho in any fashion, and why would Cho be using the public women’s room of a show she’s headlining?). They might get people fired: “A primetime TV booker asked if I’d do a debate panel with [former White House chief of staff] Reince Priebus. I said it wasn’t my wheelhouse and I couldn’t get down to the studio in time. She insisted and arranged a satellite truck to come to my house. She’d meant to book Neera Tanden,” said the TV correspondent and radio host Nayyera Haq. Sometimes they get called out by other people. The actor Lee Shorten said: “Gonna use fake names but was on a show and the camera operator was like, ‘Peter, can you move to your left? Peter. Peter. Move. Peter, can you move?’ This goes on for a bit. Then he turns to the second assistant director and says, ‘Why isn’t Peter moving?’ And my scene partner says loudly, ‘Probably because it’s not Peter. It’s Lee.’ Peter being another Asian actor on the show.” Other times they don’t get caught at all: “At my old studio we used to have food catered in for late-night work,” said the video game producer Josh Tsui. “One night we got a ton of sushi brought in. Being budget-conscious, I asked the caterer, ‘What the hell?’” Apparently he’d mistaken one of my [other Asian] employees as me and asked him what the next night’s order should be.” Sometimes the Asians involved eventually develop a system: “For about a year I had a colleague at the White House who confused me with another Asian co-worker so often that the other Asian guy and I would frequently trade notes given to us by the colleague but meant for the other,” said Ronnie Cho, former associate director of the office of public engagement under Barack Obama. Sometimes there isn’t time to even figure out what’s going on: “I was doing an event that had a couple of chefs involved – [Momofuku’s] Dave Chang and [Kogi Taco’s] Roy Choi. We were all on stage speaking and I was DJing,” said the legendary producer Dan “the Automator” Nakamura. “Sitting down to eat, someone – pretty recognizable! – waved me over and started the conversation with ‘Thank you, chef!’ I wonder who he thought I was …” I’ve had my own share of Sorry Wrong Asian incidents. It doesn’t help that I write in somewhat adjacent spaces to another famous Jeff whose name is two letters different from mine – Jeff Chang, author of the history of hip-hop Can’t Stop Won’t Stop, and arguably the better, more prolific and more talented Jeff _ang. We’ve gotten compliments meant for each other – I’m sure I get more intended for him than vice versa. I’ve had to turn down at least one speaking engagement because it was clearly intended for him (although, damn, it was hard to say no to the trip and money, and I think I could have faked it for long enough to meet Jay-Z). We’ve even spoken at an online summit together and had the host introduce us in reverse – everyone just went on with the agenda, pretending it didn’t happen! Fortunately, because my editor is also Asian, I’m pretty sure he actually intended to assign this piece to me … … right?

4/20/2022,"‘Once I started the research,” says Kenneth Tindall, “I was shocked at how much Casanova achieved, how brilliant his mind was, how many different roles he played in one lifetime.” The son of two Venetian actors, Casanova was a priest, a violinist, an author, a gambler, a soldier, a diplomat, an occultist and a prisoner. Tindall begins his wonderment afresh: “To translate The Iliad, to speak seven languages, to start the state lottery in France – the list is sort of endless. I came away thinking, as I sat there watching Netflix, ‘I’m really not living enough!’” But then, everyone thinks they know who Giacomo Casanova was: the famous cad whose name became synonymous with seduction; the breaker of hearts all across Europe. But if that were all there was to the 18th-century libertine, there’s no way he would have become such an enduring cultural figure, inspiring everything from the 1918 novella Casanova’s Homecoming by Arthur Schnitzler to the Pet Shop Boys song Casanova in Hell. Then there are the film stars who brought the unscrupulous lover back to life, from Bela Lugosi to Richard Chamberlain and John Malkovich. More recently, we’ve had a Divine Comedy album, a Horrible Histories song – and a ballet by Tindall, premiered in 2017, now restaged and touring the UK. “I quickly realised,” he says, “that people don’t really know anything about Casanova at all.” That he was charismatic and quick-witted is a given, but for multiple incarnations, on stage and on screen over the decades, each creator has taken a different view, informed as much by their own times and sensibilities as the protagonist’s. Dennis Potter made Casanova the subject of his first TV series in 1971. Starring Frank Finlay, who was Oscar-nominated for his Iago in Olivier’s Othello, Potter’s version takes freedom as its theme. Framed by Casanova’s incarceration in the Doge’s palace – from which he made an audacious escape – the story is told in flashbacks and flashforwards, with multiple bare-breasted women opening their arms to him, looking straight down the camera lens (très risqué at the time). This Casanova is both a complete sleaze (“There is not a woman alive who cannot be conquered”) and a tortured romantic haunted by the various loves he’s left behind. The women seem to be giddily enjoying themselves, although as Casanova’s advances move from flattering to cajoling to domineering, it’s impossible not to feel ill at ease in the #MeToo era. Potter may skirt the darkness but it’s still simmering beneath. The writer was sexually abused by his uncle as a 10-year-old. Talking about it in the 1990s, he said: “I was trapped by an adult’s sexual appetite.” It feels like that’s the story he’s telling here about Casanova’s young “conquests”.Nonetheless, in Potter’s telling, you are mostly on the character’s side. When the great Italian film-maker Federico Fellini read Casanova’s memoir, however, he apparently took a serious disliking to the man. You can see that disgust in the director’s 1976 film, in which Donald Sutherland plays him as a strangely blank, increasingly lonely and pathetic figure – a slave to his impulses who desires (and fails) to be taken seriously for his mind. It’s a film full of high hairlines, powdered faces, Oscar-winning costume designs and a look so ripe it seems about to rot. The sex is clothed and either comically choreographed or disturbing – especially the rape of an artist’s model in front of a bawdy court – and his conquests include a mechanical doll. At the end, Casanova is reduced to a shabby relic as the librarian at the Castle of Dux in what is now the Czech Republic, where he died aged 73. Thirty years on, the mood had changed, with troubling symbolism replaced by comedy capers. The way to treat Casanova’s legacy now was to make light of it. Two screen versions appeared in 2005: Lasse Hallström’s film, starring Heath Ledger, and a BBC series by Russell T Davies that made David Tennant a leading man just before he took over Doctor Who (in case you are wondering, the titles of these works are almost always Casanova). Both leads are likable scamps rather than lascivious lotharios, getting one over on authority (and their leg over while they’re at it). Both also feature women masquerading as men in order to have their voices heard – and a big dose of feminism. Tennant’s hero is an adventurer, resilient, upbeat, always coming out on top, and he falls genuinely in love. That version is full of colour, noughties music and jokes … until it suddenly descends into a surprisingly dark ending as Casanova finally reaps what he sows and Davies shows us where complete liberty leads. In Hallström’s Hollywood take, it’s all happy endings, with Ledger consciously undermining Casanova’s reputation. “I don’t conquer,” he insists. “I submit.” This reading is based around a single (fictional) love affair with a feisty feminist scholar, played by Sienna Miller. He meets his match, she can’t stand him, but in the end falls for him anyway. It’s pure romcom. Not long after, theatre company Told By an Idiot went one step further in the feminist stakes and made Casanova a woman. Director Paul Hunter wanted to subvert this iconic male figure and give actor Hayley Carmichael a meaty part. Poet Carol Ann Duffy wrote a fantastical script which takes Casanova from falling in love on a 1940s ocean liner to a heavily symbolic scene in which our heroine is about to be gored by a bull but charms the animal into submission instead. The effect of making Casanova a woman? “I think she was able to be more surprising in her conquests, harder to read somehow,” says Hunter. “We’d always been fascinated by the space between laughter and pain – and it felt like there was something really juicy here. When she was working in the library, it was very poignant, this old woman on her own, revisiting the ghosts of her past. It became more complex.” Interestingly, they ended up cutting out most of the sex. Carmichael said at the time that, even if she was in control, she still somehow looked like a victim. “However much you tried to subvert that,” says Hunter, “at times there was a sense of ‘Oh poor Casanova’ because she was a woman.” The possibility of a female libertine remains a juicy subject on screen, though, as the success of Fleabag shows. So when Tindall came to remake the story for Northern Ballet, what type of Casanova did he want? Dance is perhaps the hardest form in which to capture the wiles, wit and complexities of such a multifaceted character. But Tindall found himself pulled in by the politics. “At that time,” he says, “Venice was the most policed state in the world. They’re morally loose, but religion is huge. Casanova is essentially arrested for being free-thinking and for joining the Enlightenment – for jumping social class. All things that are relevant now.” But it’s the senses that are stimulated when the curtain first goes up, revealing a sumptuous set with beautiful dancers made to look ravishing by Tindall’s choreography, long legs everywhere, pointe shoes like talons. All these bodies do eventually have to become entangled, however, and one difference in restaging the show now – even compared with making it in 2017 – was the treatment of sexual encounters. Scottish Ballet, for example, recently hired an intimacy coach to work on a new production. “Dance is intimate by its nature,” says Tindall. “Bodies touch immediately, so it’s different from acting. But it’s essential to create a safe working space where everybody feels comfortable. It was a huge conversation for us.”Tindall’s story, written with Casanova biographer Ian Kelly, tells the tale through his relationships with three key women, but Tindall has added new sections that reflect on Casanova’s character – especially his decline, his failing intellect and the loss of all the loves in his life. “He was always yearning for connection,” says Tindall. “It’s very Freudian with his mother at the beginning of his life. He’s neglected.”For Tindall, Casanova’s story is still worth telling because he is so much more than a serial seducer. “That’s absolutely part of his life,” he says. “But the statistics – his bed-post notches compared to other libertines of the time – it’s low numbers.” The reason Casanova is the best known is because he wrote his own story, self-mythologising in his memoirs. “He was trying to leave behind something he was proud of,” says Tindall. “He would be over the moon to know there are still works being made about him now.” Northern Ballet’s Casanova is on tour until 21 May.",Arts/Stage,Ultimate sleazeball or tortured romantic?

4/20/2022,"The promise of Emmanuel Macron’s presidency was straightforward: he would transcend the concepts of left and right, and consign populism to the margins of French politics. His rise to power in the spring of 2017 was an apparent lifeboat for liberals traumatised by Brexit and Donald Trump: here was the “centrist” prince over the water, a beacon of good governance and confirmation that the grownups were back in the room. It hasn’t worked out that way. Champions of so-called centrism believed Macron would be a desperately needed antidote to political polarisation. But Macronism has acted as an accelerant, not a coolant, leaving the country more troubled, divided and disillusioned than when this former investment banker secured office. Macron’s likely re-election, thanks to tactical voting, should not obscure a damning fact: the far right will come closer to holding power in a western European nation than at any time since 1945. As I arrived in Paris a couple of hours before voting concluded in the first round, a taxi driver voiced what has become a common refrain: “Macron is for the rich”. Within months of Macron – widely known as the “president of the rich” – taking the post, more than eight in 10 French citizens believed his tax policies favoured the wealthy. His drive to hike the pension age is a class issue, too: after all, the richest French men have a life expectancy 13 years higher than their poorest counterparts, and deprived citizens have fewer healthy years to look forward to. His introduction of a “carbon tax” was a case study in how not to tackle the climate emergency: by hitting less well-off people most, he violated the basic principle of what is called a just transition – that the cost of preserving civilisation from calamity must not be shouldered by the poor. Public consent for necessary measures will be destroyed by such an approach. As the first-round post-election poll revealed that the leftwing candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon had narrowly failed to reach the second stage of the contest, the expressions of grief and rage on the faces of his supporters were strikingly similar to those who had witnessed the routs of Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn: these were younger citizens aggrieved at their hopes being snatched away by older generations. On his election, Macron became the youngest president in French history, but his base of support comes from older voters – above all, the over-70s – and he is a distant third among under-35s. It is Mélenchon who is most popular among the young, many of whom say they may abstain in the second round. “I am scared if I vote, and I am scared if I don’t vote,” one young woman told me, arguing that by waging war on the public sector “he [Macron] is creating a monster” and laying the foundations for a far-right victory next time. I hear this narrative again and again. It is easy to berate these youngsters: to tell them to park their grievances since, however profound their fury with Macron, the victory of the far right’s Marine Le Pen would be infinitely worse. Yet attacking the disillusioned is rarely convincing. When I put to these voters the racist menace posed by the far right, they note that Macron’s interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, denounced Le Pen for being “too soft on immigration”. Macron has praised the Nazi collaborator Marshal Pétain as a “great soldier”, and been condemned by Human Rights Watch for tearing down refugees’ tents. In his 2017 campaign, Macron pledged to curtail police excesses, yet, when his carbon tax unleashed the gilets jaunes movement, protesters were dealt with brutally. “I have never been so scared of protesting as I have been under Emmanuel Macron,” the young leftwing intellectual Édouard Louis tells me. Rather than acting as a firewall against rightwing extremism, Macronian “centrism” absorbs its racism and authoritarianism, further legitimising the far right in the process. Undoubtedly, a minority of Mélenchon supporters will defect to Le Pen’s camp: these are voters who don’t think in terms of “left” and “right”, but who resent a system they understandably believe is rigged against them, and who were most convinced by the radical left’s answers in the first round. “Macron only thinks of the rich. He’s a guy who’s all about the money,” one older Mélenchon supporter in the northern city of Douai tells me. That doesn’t mean the left has nothing to answer for: the nearby town of Hénin-Beaumont is a former stronghold of socialists and communists, but is now firmly Le Pen country and the place she cast her own vote. Many working-class voters came to believe the socialists had nothing but contempt for them, and under François Hollande’s presidency – which promised to confront austerity and then did no such thing – the party collapsed. Indeed, in this election, the centre-left’s standard-bearer, Anne Hidalgo, chalked up a paltry 1.74%, finishing seventh in Paris – the city in which she is mayor. While Mélenchon did unexpectedly well, the radical left – as in other European countries, except where it governs as a junior partner, in Spain and Nordic countries – is yet to emerge victorious from the rubble. If Macron wins, albeit with a tighter margin than in 2017, expect a mixture of relief and triumphalism from centrists. This failure to learn lessons is a profound error. Witness, too, the fate of Joe Biden in the US: again, the promise here was that with the “grownups” back in charge, the years of turbulence would end and politics would become boring again. No such thing happened: instead, Biden’s popularity has collapsed – not least among the young, who cannot be described as natural Donald Trump supporters – and a revival of the president’s predecessor is entirely plausible, with potentially terminal consequences for US democracy. This is an age of grievance and fury driven by stagnating living conditions and justifiable pessimism, however much predominantly affluent centrists dismiss the consequences as mass irrationality. One Macron supporter told me far-right success was down to conspiracy theories and the fact that “a lot of French people forget they are extremely lucky”. The centrists believed that by presenting an image of moderation and statesmanship they could make all that go away. They were wrong.

4/20/2022,"‘I’m not going to get any dog in a headlock. These are beings that are alive. I’m not running a torture chamber.” Stuart Simons, 48, is a dog groomer and co-founder of Tails of St Leonards, which, at mid-morning on a Friday, is extremely busy but surprisingly quiet. That’s because the Afghan hound they call Zorro has not yet arrived. Ernie, a six-year-old racing greyhound until he retired, had never seen a ball; he is here to get his nails done. Bear is also six, a bernese mountain dog with a (step) brother, Sully, of the same breed, and they both need grooming every three months. If they get dirty in between, their owner puts a swimming costume on and walks them into the shower. If you knew how big these dogs are, you, too, would find that image difficult to shake. I’m still a bit puzzled about the swimming costume. Does your dog mind if you’re naked? Amber is a cockapoo that goes wild with joy whenever she sees a man, but cockapoos always have a really strong opinion about something. Then there’s Simons’ own dog, a standard poodle called Ralph, and his colleague Maria Pratley’s cockapoo, Oscar. Oscar had such bad separation anxiety that, when she is washing another dog, he has to lie underneath the bath. Otis, a cavapoochon (part cavalier king charles spaniel, part poodle, part bichon frise) is biddable, as a third groomer, Sophie Humphrey, shaves him back to glory, but his eyes keep asking: “Why? Why does it matter what my tail looks like?” Simons is under no illusions about his profession: “People say, ‘I’ve booked him in for a treat, for a spa day,’ but dogs don’t want to be here. They’d rather be out and about.” Nonetheless, they need these visits, because a matted life is miserable. Grooming is a serious, and also very big, business. Simons started grooming nearly 20 years ago, as a side hustle when his main job was in musical theatre. He still does musicals and cabaret, and has a second salon in east London. He had the idea when he was visiting family in Vero Beach, Florida, in 2004, and noticed that there were groomers on every corner. “I just thought to myself, ‘We always follow the US. It’s coming.’” Between 2010 and 2016, the grooming market grew by 25%, according to one study, with pet owners spending steadily more on their dogs, partly down to changing norms around husbandry. It has become routine to worry about their moods, their diet and their allergies. They’ve morphed into children, which is how people unabashedly talk about them. Simons calls Ralph “a child in a dog suit – so intelligent”; the owner of the berneses, Vanessa, 53, says she adopted Sully “when his parents got divorced”; Kim Denman, 62, says of Zorro, “My kids are grown up – he’s my new baby. He had me up at 10 to six this morning.” It makes sense in one way: you love them, you feed them, you tell them to do things and they don’t listen – they are essentially children. But it’s weird if you have even a fleeting memory of dogs in the 70s and 80s, as Simons and I do – people still loved them, but they happily hit them over the head with rolled-up newspapers, and nobody ever talked about “socialisation”. By 2018, pet care and grooming – this is leaving aside food, the main expense, and vet bills, which is the thing everyone complains about – cost approximately £1.7bn a year, and the projection then was that it would rise to £2.1bn by 2023. But, by 2020, grooming costs in the UK had already reached £3.8bn. Two things had happened: the pandemic, and the cockapoo. Everyone’s heard of the lockdown puppy: 11% of households had, between them, bought 3.2 million new pets by the end of 2021. There are now 12m dogs in the UK, and 33% of households have at least one. As lockdown lifted, “businesses had to adapt, because people didn’t want to go out without their dogs,” says Simons. Along Kings Road, St Leonards, signage reading “Dogs welcome” is the new “No smoking”. Register offices take dogsmaids instead of bridesmaids, and there’s a niche side industry for wedding outfits and concierge services (AKA clearing up dog poo, which even I, a feminist, can see is not the work of a bride). Simons has done countless grooming sessions for weddings, though the most memorable romantic gesture involved trimming the words “Will you marry me?” into the side of a cockapoo. “I never heard what she said. And I never saw the dog again,” he says, reflectively. The most popular single breed in the UK, now, is the crossbreed, a deliberate cross between two Kennel Club approved breeds, not to be confused with the mixed breed, which is just the result of two random dogs getting it on. Pomeranians and poodles are often used as the base breed for specific qualities (the first is cute and small, the second hypoallergenic), resulting in the pomsky (half Siberian husky), the pomchi (half chihuahua), the cockapoo (half cocker spaniel), the Maltipoo (half Maltese) and the labradoodle (half labrador). “Long-haired” and “short-haired” don’t really hold up as denominators where dogs are concerned: they’re hair-bearing or fur-bearing. A hair-bearing dog’s coat is like human hair, and will grow and grow until you cut it – this is the poodle, the lhasa apso and the Afghan hound. Fur-bearing means it will grow to a predetermined length and then stop, but that doesn’t mean it stops short – the fluffy pomeranian is a fur-bearer. There are dogs that are a mixture – as Simons points out, “cocker spaniels are fur-bearing on the body and hair-bearing on the legs and ears”, which is why their ears always smell like dishcloths. (No groomer has said that to me. It is merely something I have observed.) There are also gradations within each category, so dogs bred as ratters – border terriers, wire haired dachshunds – have to be “hand-stripped” rather than clipped, which involves plucking out unwanted hairs either entirely manually or with the help of a special tool. Long story short, or hair story fur, if you prefer, this is the business of experts – if you shear a dog that’s meant to be hand-stripped, if you groom the puppy coat too early, if the owner doesn’t brush the dog in between grooms, you can really mess things up, change the coat colour, destroy the waterproofing, cause alopecia. There are breeds that can suffer serious health detriment if you don’t groom them at all. Simons once groomed a dog with hair so matted that, when he removed the hair from its legs, its nail beds started bleeding because the hair had been constricting its blood supply. Opinions will clearly differ about the best starter dog, but, from a maintenance perspective, getting a poodle-cross as your first pet is like getting a violin as your first musical instrument – which is to say, surprisingly hard. “Certain breeds of dog have more high maintenance owners,” Sophie Humphrey says, diplomatically. “A lot of owners want the hair to remain long, but if you want that, you have to look after it.” People think it’s like going to the hairdresser, and they can just ask for what they want. But, in fact, “it’s like going to the dentist when you haven’t brushed your teeth. If they go, ‘You need a filling’, you can’t turn round and say, ‘But I don’t want a filling’.” As she speaks, the fourth and final groomer, Claire Clarkson, 43, is washing eight-month-old Zorro. You’ve never heard anything like it. He sounds so human, so amazed and appalled, like a builder falling off some scaffolding. He’s just making his presence felt though, apparently. “If he was that unhappy,” said Clarkson, “he’d be doing a lot more than ‘Ar-ar-ar’. He’s a proper protester, Zorro. If he could have a picket board, it would say, ‘Do not touch my bum’.” Humphrey trained as a groomer straight from Plumpton College, but the more usual route is via humans – Clarkson worked in hair and beauty, while Pratley was a barber for 25 years before she shifted to dogs. (Is there anything she misses about man clients? “Nope.”) “People always say, ‘My dog’s haircut costs more than mine does’,” says Simons. Unlike so many things people say, this is no exaggeration: a “shave-down” is between £40 and £75, a scissor cut between £50 and £90, depending on the breed. Which makes sense to Simons: “Look at the dog. It’s wriggly, it will take two hours, sometimes it will poo on the table. At least a human will sit still. It’s a much bigger job than your hair.” The principles of grooming, for all but poodles and Bedlington terriers, are simple – if you knew the theory of five different styles for head, feet and tail, you would be able to master the breed standard – but that masks a huge number of crucial techniques, from nail clipping to hand stripping, control and restraint, bathing and cleaning, and the training is quite involved, though the industry is unregulated. Simons runs The Groomers Spotlight, a guild to prove groomers’ qualifications, not unlike a Spotlight for actors. “In any creative, unregulated industry, people need some way to know what they’re getting.” The trend is to make groomers more like hairdressers – open-plan, lots of cute dogs you can see, a social experience – which is a staffing challenge more than anything. “People who work with dogs, they often aren’t very sociable,” Simons says, though his own team is a carefully curated exception. But there is deeper knowledge than anything a City & Guilds qualification can teach you. Dachshunds have a tendency to bite. In September and October, almost every dog has fleas, which are trying to find a warm host; the rest of the year, they live in the carpet. Brachycephalic (flat-nosed) breeds should never go in a drying cabinet because their internal cooling system is shot. Cavapoos are prone to heart defects. None of the groomers in Tails of St Leonards have ever been bitten, because there are so many signs a dog will give you before the bite – a lip curl, a whale-eye. Noise doesn’t always mean anything: Ernie, for instance, is a “classic sportsman”, says his owner Abby Harris, 41. If he gets an injury he’ll hugely over dramatise: massive yelp; hop around; never walk again. Then he’s fine.” Even dogs with short hair should see a groomer for their nails, though Clarkson and I both have staffies and neither of us have ever set foot in a salon as a punter. “Is it ever nice?” I ask, as she grooms Teddy the maltese, which takes for ever, “to leave all this at work …” “And have a proper dog at home? Yes.” This doesn’t stop me sharing my hair woes with Simons, as my dog is almost completely bald, and, after a number of visits, the vet finally lost patience with me and said: “It’s like if your husband goes bald. You just live with it.” (“Funny you should say that,” I said, “because my first husband actually was bald.”) “We have a great relationship with the vets round here,” Simons says, “so nothing against vets. But our entire knowledge is skin and coat, so we take it a bit more seriously.” Look, it takes a long time to train, and it can be very noisy, and the work is very physical and none of this is for the faint of heart, but I’ve rarely seen so much pleasure in a workplace. But then, I wasn’t here for the one day a month they devote to cats. It’s a great day, money-wise, but that’s all danger money. Simons explains: “You can only do what a cat allows you to do. They have weapons. You can get cat-scratch fever. A dog will go, ‘I don’t like that, wham’. A cat can really store resentment. There’s a massive gap in the market for cat grooming. Because they’re arseholes.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Because I’m woof it!

4/20/2022,"A woman has described how she spent more than six hours of her 100th birthday waiting in agony for an ambulance after slipping and fracturing her pelvis while getting ready for a family lunch. Irene Silsby was due to be picked up by her niece, Lynne Taylor, for a celebration to mark her centenary on 9 April. But she fell in the windowless bathroom of her care home in Greetham, Rutland, and staff called an ambulance at 9am after she managed to summon help. “All I remember is I was in terrible pain,” said Silsby from her hospital bed on Saturday. When asked of the ambulance delay, she said: “It’s disgusting. I don’t know how I stood it so long, the pain was so severe.” Taylor expected to meet the ambulance as she arrived 45 minutes later. But when she reached the care home, the manager said it would be a 10-hour wait, she said. What was to be her aunt’s first trip outside the care home in more than five months turned into her lying on a cold floor surrounded by pillows and blankets to keep her warm and quell some of the discomfort. Taylor, 60, recalled her aunt saying: “They’re not coming to me because they know I’m 100 and I’m not really worth it any more.” Taylor said she had never felt so scared, frustrated and worried. After calling 999 and expressing her outrage, she was told that life-threatening conditions were being prioritised. “I thought she was going to die,” she said. “I didn’t think that any frail, tiny, 100-year-old body could put up with that level of pain on the floor.” To distract her aunt, Taylor read aloud the card Silsby had received from the Queen wishing her a happy 100th birthday. She said her aunt replied: “I bet she’s not lying on the floor waiting for an ambulance.” The incident was upgraded to critical at about 3pm and the ambulance arrived an hour later, Taylor said. As she was carried down the care home’s small staircase, Silsby struggled to use the administered gas and oxygen. To have morphine delivered she would have had to wait another 35 minutes for a paramedic. “I know why they had to do it because they are under pressure,” Taylor said. “Her being in pain going down the stairs just almost had to be the case because they had to move on to the next person, and I don’t criticise them for this.” When Taylor arrived at the hospital behind the ambulance, she was not permitted inside. In the following days Taylor was still in shock. “It was just such an awful thing to happen,” she said. NHS leaders have said lives are being put at risk by ambulance wait times. Hospitals are under pressure as a result of unprecedented demand from patients after two years of the coronavirus pandemic, compounded by staff shortages in the NHS and social care as well as a fall in bed numbers in both settings. Dr Katherine Henderson, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the Guardian this month that some 999 callers were experiencing waits of up to 22 hours. In one instance, a man died after waiting four hours for an ambulance. In another, a man was left in pain for 14 hours, having phoned 999 multiple times. Taylor, 60, believes a succession of governments have overseen a decline in the NHS, exacerbated by Covid and Brexit. “There was not the funding when we went into Covid, the national health was not in a healthy, good way,” she said. “Before that we had Brexit where we lost lots of really valuable people that work for the NHS, and I think there’s been a pretty strategic working towards privatisation which has actually cost the service so much money that it has broken it.” Richard Lyne, Divisional Director for Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland at East Midlands Ambulance Service, said every call is assessed to ensure people experiencing life-threatening emergencies, such as cardiac arrest, are seen first. “We are deeply sorry that we were not able to arrive sooner, and we recognise the distress that this will have caused the patient,” said Lyne. “The patient remained in a place of safety while waiting for an ambulance, and clinical professionals from our ambulance control room were in contact with them.”",News/Society,Woman waits six hours for ambulance after fall on her 100th birthday,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/20/woman-waits-six-hours-for-ambulance-after-fall-on-her-100th-birthday-rutland
4/20/2022,"Growing numbers of Britons are paying for private medical treatment because of the record delays people are facing trying to access NHS care, a report has revealed. They are using their own savings to pay for procedures that involve some of the longest waiting times in NHS hospital, such as diagnostic tests, cataract removals and joint replacements. The increase in the willingness to self-pay is closely linked to a desire for private treatments that was increasing even before Covid struck in March 2020. But many private hospitals were unable to meet that demand for much of the pandemic because coronavirus disrupted so much normal healthcare. Private hospital operators expect the boom in self-pay to continue for at least the next three to five years, with half of industry leaders expecting the market to grow by 10%-15% by 2025. The in-depth report, written by the private health sector analysts LaingBuisson, states: “Despite Brexit and economic uncertainty, the main driver of interest and take-up of self-pay appears more directly linked to NHS waiting times than in previous years. “What is clear is that there is a significant growth in demand for diagnostics and outpatient consulting and treatment, which does seem to have been sustained as we move into 2022.” The trend was illustrated recently when Spire Healthcare, the UK’s biggest private hospital group, disclosed in its most recent annual accounts that it had recorded a 115% jump in the number of people paying for their own care between 2020 and 2021. This helped it to increase its revenues from £920m in 2020 to £1.106bn last year, the firm said. Pensioners and older working-age adults are driving the increase in self-funded care and, in some cases, are using money they have not spent during the pandemic, according to Liz Heath, a LaingBuisson consultant and the report’s author. “With the main demographic group for self-pay being the over 55-year-olds, it may be that inability to spend on other lifestyle options and considered purchases such as leisure, holidays and eating out in the past two years may influence spending on health and wellbeing”, the report said. The total value of the private self-pay market has risen every year since 2010 and hit an estimated £1.117bn – the highest ever – in 2020. Heath said that 2022 was likely to show further “sustained growth”. Some providers of private diagnostic tests such as MRI and CT scans have reported year-on-year rises of people self-paying of 50-60% in the past 12 months. While London and the south-east are recording a rise in self-pay, with their higher numbers of wealthy older people, “heightened interest in self-pay” had also been identified in more deprived areas, where traditionally few people go private, such as the north and north-east of England, Heath added. More than half of industry leaders expect the market will grow by 10%-15% by 2025. Payment plans offered by private firms such as Circle and Nuffield Health, that let patients spread the cost of their treatment, often interest-free, are also encouraging more people to go private. Dr Tony O’Sullivan, an ex-NHS consultant and a co-chair of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public, said: “The government’s deliberate and sustained running down of the health service has resulted in a two-tier system. The NHS is now in a permanent state of distress, leaving patients desperate for care, and – if they can afford it – feeling as if they have no choice but to go private, undermining the very vision of equality and care a well-funded NHS was so famous for. “Hard-working people would not need to line shareholders pockets in this way if the NHS had not been underfunded, understaffed and neglected for so long.” David Hare, the chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Provider Network, a trade body that represents more than 100 operators, said: “With NHS waiting lists at record levels and likely to continue growing, it is not surprising that increasing numbers of patients across the country are paying privately for treatment, including those who would never have previously considered doing so.”",News/Society,NHS waiting lists drive more Britons to pay for medical treatment,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/20/nhs-waiting-lists-drive-more-britons-to-pay-for-medical-treatment
4/20/2022,"Shaima Dallali, the incoming president of the National Union of Students, is supporting an investigation into allegations of antisemitism within the organisation she will soon lead – but says the controversy has made her feel unsafe after she became a target for online abuse and violent threats. In an interview with the Guardian, Dallali, who is due to start her role in July for a two-year term, said she had been misrepresented since her election and denied that she was antisemitic. “The investigation is the right thing to do,” she said. “I know quite a few Jewish students feel alienated. This is the first step to start bridging the gap and reaching out to Jewish students and ensuring that Jewish students feel like they have a place in NUS, so I do welcome it.” As the new NUS president, she says her priorities are the mental health crisis among students. She wants a democratised, decolonised education system, and she wants to bridge the gap between the national body and student unions around the country. But those plans have been overshadowed by the controversy that led to the independent investigation announced last week. It followed complaints from Jewish student organisations, including the Union of Jewish Students (UJS), and a letter signed by 21 former NUS presidents urging the NUS to address long-running concerns over antisemitism and Dallali’s own social media posts. After Dallali’s election the UJS has strongly objected to comments she is alleged to have made previously, including a post 10 years ago which read: “Khaybar Khaybar O Jews … Muhammad’s army will return Gaza”, referencing a AD628 assault on Jews. Dallali has apologised for the tweet, saying she is not the same person she was then and has since changed the language she uses to talk about the Israel-Palestine conflict. Dallali, 27, currently the president of the students’ union at City, University of London said the backlash against her election was part of pattern, seen with previous student leaders including Malia Bouattia, who in 2016 became the first black Muslim woman to become NUS president. “Unfortunately, as a black Muslim woman, it is something that I expected because I’ve seen it happen to other black Muslim women when they take up positions in the student union or the NUS, where they are attacked based on their political beliefs or their pro-Palestinian stance.” She said she had received a lot of Islamaphobic, racist online abuse. “I’ve had private messages of people calling me a raghead, people telling me to go and kill myself, calling me a Jew hater and an antisemite. That has been difficult to read. “And so many threats as well – if I continue to do this then things will happen to me. I just try to delete, to block, I try not to let it get to my head. It’s something I receive every day and I’m continuing to receive. It’s affected me mentally and physically. Sometimes I don’t feel safe.” After the ex-presidents’ letter, a letter in support of Dallali has been circulating, which calls for there to be simultaneous NUS investigations into Islamophobia and racism, as well as antisemitism. On the tweet from 10 years ago, Dallali said she has already made an unreserved apology: “I’m not the same person I was. I have developed my political language to talk about Palestine and Israel. I stand by that apology.” She said that Muslims were not allowed room for growth. “It genuinely is really difficult to have to see these horrible things being said about me. They are not true. This idea that I don’t like Jewish people, or I’m hateful towards the Jewish community is absolutely not true. “During my time as a sabbatical officer, I’ve worked with the Jewish community to support them, for example to commemorate Holocaust memorial day. My door has always been open to all students regardless of who they are.” She went on: “I want to reiterate my willingness to work with Jewish students to combat antisemitism, to address their concerns. I want to represent all students and their concerns are important. “I may at times disagree with people politically,” said Dallali. “Everyone has the right to have their own political ideas, but I don’t hate anyone. I definitely don’t hate the Jewish community. I do believe I can bridge the gap and build bridges.” As well as the 10-year-old tweet, Dallali has also been challenged over fundraising for the campaign group Cage a couple of years ago which she did not dispute and said she supported the group’s work on Prevent. She has been criticised for comments she wrote about a homophobic Muslim cleric, which she says were taken out of context, and she has defended taking part in a protest at King’s College London (KCL) where a talk was being given by a former Israeli politician. “At no point did I target or harass anyone, rather it was an expression of disappointment at KCL for allowing this person to come and talk. Everyone has a right to protest. Everyone has a right to freedom of speech and I was exercising my right like everyone else,” Dallali said.",News/Education,"New NUS leader welcomes antisemitism inquiry, but fears for her safety",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/20/new-nus-leader-welcomes-antisemitism-inquiry-but-fears-for-her-safety
4/20/2022,"Household contacts of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Victoria and New South Wales will no longer be required to isolate, with both states announcing a significant easing of restrictions from the end of the week. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, announced on Wednesday that from 6pm on Friday, those who live with positive cases or are deemed close contacts will no longer have to quarantine for seven days, provided they do not have symptoms. They will need to undertake daily rapid antigen tests, wear masks indoors, avoid contact with elderly and immunocompromised people and work from home where possible. They will also be unable to visit high-risk settings such as aged care homes, hospitals, disability and correctional facilities unless an exemption applies. Perrottet also announced that public health orders requiring key workplaces to be vaccinated will be lifted, and based instead on risk assessments under occupational work health and safety rules. Orders requiring aged care and disability workers to be vaccinated will remain in force, however. From 30 April, unvaccinated international travellers arriving in NSW will not be required to undertake hotel quarantine. “This is not the end of the pandemic. We will always tailor our restrictions – as we have said from the outset over the last two years – to the circumstances that we find ourselves in,” Perrottet said. “But today is a day where the people of our state in NSW can be incredibly proud. We have had an incredibly low death rate, we have put downward pressure on our health system and that is because of the efforts and sacrifice people have made.” In Victoria, the health minister, Martin Foley, announced close contacts will no longer have to quarantine, provided they wear a mask indoors, avoid sensitive settings such as hospitals and aged care homes, and undertake five negative rapid antigen tests over the seven-day period. Under the new restrictions, which come into effect from 11.59pm on Friday, patrons no longer need to show proof of their vaccination status to enter hospitality or entertainment venues, and check-in QR codes will no longer be required anywhere. Masks will only be required on public transport, in taxis and rideshares, at airports and in health, aged care and justice setttings. Quarantine will also be scrapped for unvaccinated international arrivals, with the recently opened purpose-built $200m quarantine facility in Mickleham to largely be used for Covid-positive people who cannot safely isolate at home. Unlike NSW, existing vaccination mandates for workers will remain in Victoria. Victoria’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said authorities would work with individual industries in the coming months to “transition” away from mandates. He said Wednesday’s announcement was possible due to the state’s high vaccination rate – about 95% of Victorians aged 16 and older are double vaccinated, while 66% have had three doses. “Today is a significant day for all Victorians – not a wholesale change, but an appropriate next step in this phase of the management of the pandemic,” he said. “From Saturday, it will absolutely focus more on the individual discretion of all of us in the community to make appropriate choices.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sutton was confident the state had reached the peak of its latest Omicron outbreak, despite a slight jump in case numbers. Victoria recorded 14 deaths and 10,628 new infections on Wednesday, while NSW recorded 15 deaths and 15,414 cases. “Today’s a blip; I think people defer their RAT tests and their PCR tests while they’re on holiday. NSW has had the same blip today, but I think that will smooth out over the next few days and we’ll see this plateau phase,” Sutton said. “But it’ll be a long tail and a slow decline, we’re not going to see a dramatic drop in numbers.” He did not anticipate changes to close contact rules would lead to a spike in new infections. “It’s not going to be a big driver of case numbers,” Sutton said. “But we need the compliance and people to follow suit.”",News/Australia news,NSW and Victoria to scrap Covid isolation requirements for household and close contacts,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/nsw-and-victoria-to-scrap-covid-isolation-requirements-for-household-and-close-contacts
4/20/2022,"New South Wales and Victoria have eased Covid-19 restrictions further, removing vaccination, mask and isolation requirements in many situations, from 6pm and 11.59pm Friday 22 April, respectively. So what exactly has changed? You will now no longer be required to isolate for seven days, provided you wear a mask indoors and do not visit sensitive settings such as aged care, hospitals, disability, and correctional facilities. Close contacts will also be required to undertake rapid antigen tests five times over the seven days they previously would have been isolating. They must avoid contact with elderly and immunocompromised persons where possible, and work from home where practical – and notify their employer/educational facility that they are a close contact. These rules will apply for seven days once someone in their household tests positive for Covid-19. If you aren’t a close contact, you will only need to wear a mask in airports, on commercial planes, on public transport, and in hospitals. You are welcome to wear a mask wherever you want if that is what you decide is best for you, and masks are strongly recommended when you can’t physically distance. Capacity limits on public transport have been lifted in NSW. This is the end for QR codes. There will be no requirement for check-in at any venue, or for those venues to have check-in marshalls. People who are Covid-positive will still need to isolate for seven days from the time of the test. However, the exemption from testing and isolation post-Covid has been extended. Once the initial seven days of isolation are over, you will not be required to test for Covid or isolate for 12 weeks, up from eight now. You will still be required to upload your positive test result and inform your contacts and workplace.

International arrivals in NSW will need to take a rapid antigen test within 24 hours of arrival. In Victoria, it is just recommended they get one on arrival.

4/20/2022,"Driving through the verdant landscape of Rajanganaya, a rural district in north Sri Lanka where the hibiscus flowers pop out of rich green foliage and the mango trees are already weighed down by early fruit, it is hard to imagine this is a community in crisis. Yet for many of those who have farmed this land since the 1960s, mainly with rice and banana crops, the past year has been the toughest of their lives. “If things go on like this, in the future it will be hard to find a farmer left in Sri Lanka,” said Niluka Dilrukshi, 34, a rice paddy farmer. Sri Lanka is grappling with the worst economic crisis since its independence in 1948, and foreign currency reserves sit at their lowest level on record due to what many see as gross economic mismanagement by the government. There is barely a citizen of this south Asian island who hasn’t felt the bite of catastrophic inflation and fuel, food and medicine shortages in recent weeks. For the farmers of Sri Lanka, their problems began in April last year when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who now stands accused of pushing the country into financial ruin, implemented a sudden ban on chemical fertilisers. The full implications of the ill-advised policy – which has now been reversed – are only just being realised. Farmers say their livelihoods are under threat and for the first time in its modern history, Sri Lanka, which usually grows rice and vegetables in abundance, could run out of food as harvests drop and the government can no longer afford the food imports the country has become overdependent on in recent years. The rice yield dropped to 2.92m tonnes in 2021-22, down from the previous year’s 3.39m, and the speaker in parliament last week warned of imminent starvation among the island’s 22 million people. “We are a tropical country full of rice paddies and banana plantations, but because of this stupid fertiliser ban, now we don’t even have enough food to feed ourselves,” said Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon, 52, former governor of the southern province. “We have had past economic crises, security crises but never in Sri Lanka’s history have we had a food crisis.” On the face of it, a push to organic farming would be seen as laudable, given concerns over the use of chemical fertilisers. Yet it was the sudden and obtuse manner in which the ban was introduced – imposed virtually overnight and with no prior warning or training – and the questionable motives behind it, that have left even organic farming advocates furious. Prior to the ban, successive governments had encouraged an overdependence on chemical fertilisers by the country’s farmers, who, thanks to subsidies, would receive hundreds of kilos of fertiliser. Aside from a few select farmers, most had no idea how to successfully implement organic farming practices, and in protest many refused to farm altogether. Some believe the policy was meant to save valuable foreign dollars, others believe it was part of a more sinister agenda, following a growing intervention into the farmers’ lives by the government. “There was no proper plan, no training or education, so it’s clear to the farmers there was an ulterior [motive] here,” said Vimukthi de Silva, an organic farmer in Rajanganaya. “Prior to this policy, the government had unsuccessfully tried to commercialise farm land, which is the biggest commercial asset the country has. So many of us think this was another way to try and get farmers to leave their land, or to weaken the farmers’ position and enable a land grab.” In Rajanganaya, where most farmers operate on a small scale with no more than a hectare apiece, the majority of those the Guardian spoke to reported between a 50% to 60% reduction in their crop harvest. Last week, more than 300 farmers from the area staged a protest calling for Rajapaksa to resign. “Before the ban, this was one of the biggest markets in the country, with tonnes and tonnes of rice and vegetables,” said De Silva. “But after the ban, it became almost zero. If you talk to the rice mills, they don’t have any stock because people’s harvest dropped so much. The income of this whole community has dropped to an extremely low level.” For his whole life, 55-year-old HP Sarah Dharmasiri, had farmed udu (black gram) and rice on little more than a hectare, which was enough to feed his family and sell the rest at market to provide necessary income. But without the chemical fertiliser he was used to, his harvest from his rice crop was so little that he didn’t even have enough to bring to the market. Meanwhile, the price of pesticides needed for his gram crop had increased in price so much that he was forced to take out a high interest loan just to afford them. By the end of the last harvest he was crippled with debt and no profits to pay it off, and he has now taken up work as a daily wage labourer. “I don’t think I can be a farmer any longer,” he said. “We have some fruits and vegetable in the garden so we can survive for the moment but I think in the future there will be a time when we go starving.” Several farmers told the Guardian that last season they barely sold any of the rice or vegetables they cultivated, instead keeping it just for their own consumption to ensure the family wouldn’t go starving. It was a decision that led to a drop in the amount that went to the markets to feed the rest of the country, further driving up prices for consumers on top of already sky-high inflation. Paddy farmer Dilrukshi will only cultivate 0.2 hectares of rice this season, as opposed to the 1.6 he usually harvests. “We can’t afford the expense of cultivating any more, as the yield has gone down while prices have gone up,” he said. “We will be able to sell a little bit of that but not much, the rest we will eat ourselves.” The problems have been heavily compounded by the domestic economic crisis, rising global inflation and more recently the war in Ukraine, which has sent the price of fuel, pesticides and fertiliser soaring. Seeds have tripled in price, so have become unaffordable for some, and farmers who used to rent additional land for cultivation have stopped for this coming season. Farmers rely on diesel to run their tractors to harvest the land, but prices are so high and availability so limited – some farmers have been forced to wait in queues of over 24 hour to refuel – some have had to abandon this season’s paddy cultivation or will plant late, which means a reduced crop. The power cuts, lasting upwards of eight hours, have meant that water pumps that send water to higher areas have stopped working, cutting off the water supply for fields of vegetables and bananas. The mills, which turn the paddy into rice, also rely on power and some of the rice crop has gone bad as it couldn’t be milled in time. Farmers also don’t have the petrol or diesel to transport their crops to the market. As the next season approaches, many fear that severe crop shortages are on the horizon. The prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, announced this week the government would be reintroducing the fertiliser subsidy for farmers, but that was met with scepticism by many. “We know they don’t have the dollars to buy fertiliser,” said farmer Piyasiri Atalugama. “They think they can fool us farmers with false promises.” In recent months, Atalugama, 49, lost most of his banana crop, which is heavily dependent on chemical fertilisers, and has now decided to stop cultivating the fruit altogether after losing 150,000 rupees (£350). “I campaigned for Gota [Rajapaksa] – he had huge support from the farmers,” he said. “I am betrayed and sad by what he has done to us.”",News/World news,‘It will be hard to find a farmer left’: Sri Lanka reels from rash fertiliser ban,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/sri-lanka-fertiliser-ban-president-rajapaksa-farmers-harvests-collapse
4/20/2022,"I’d just knocked a raspberry cane out of its pot when a metallic flash of emerald green caught my eye. A 2cm-long, lozenge-shaped rose chafer beetle (Cetonia aurata) crawled out of the compost. As the light struck its forewings, they shimmered iridescent violet, copper and rose gold, like oil on water. This iridescence is a form of structural coloration – the production of colour by complex nanostructures found in the beetle’s exoskeleton that reflect light at different angles, causing the colour-changing effect. For many years, scientists have believed that biological iridescence has two primary purposes: attracting a mate, or warning off potential predators. These jewel-like scarab beetles may appear impossible to overlook when spotted feeding on flowers, but recent research suggests that their iridescence actually works as a highly effective form of camouflage in grassland, scrub and woodland edges. The sun-loving adults usually emerge between late May and mid-June, so it was a surprise to find one in the garden more than a month earlier than in previous years. Posting on the Natural History Museum’s UK biodiversity Facebook page, I discovered that mine wasn’t the only unseasonable sighting. One had been seen squashed on a path near Reading, and there were another three in a conservatory in Colchester, believed to have emerged from a pot recently brought in from the garden, where they had likely overwintered as pupae. Like many insect species, rose chafers have been affected by climate change. The average daytime temperature in Langstone in March is 11C, but high pressure had brought a lengthy spell of sunshine, with the temperature peaking at 18C, triggering the beetle’s premature emergence. Unfortunately, this meant that the beetle was out of sync with the flowering stage of its typical food plants. As their name suggests, they are particularly fond of roses, but will also feed on elder, viburnum, hogweed and soft fruit, consuming pollen, nectar and petals. With none of these species in flower, I encouraged the chafer to cling to my finger with its grappling-hook-like feet and relocated it to a winter-flowering honeysuckle.

4/20/2022,"China’s strict system of censorship is struggling against the onslaught of complaints from Shanghai, as residents find creative ways to get around bans on words, hashtags and even lyrics from the national anthem. As the weeks-long lockdown in the city of 25 million prompted widespread food shortages, delivery failures and fatal healthcare disruptions, the government has urged residents to harness “positive energy”. Dystopian banners warn people to “watch your own mouth or face punishment” and drones admonish apartment dwellers. But far from inspiring residents to fall in line, the methods have made tensions grow. On WeChat, groups have shared the names and stories of people who died, either with Covid or because the lockdown delayed their access to healthcare. They have criticised local authorities and China’s continued commitment to zero-Covid as the world opens up, shared videos of residents detained, bundled out of their apartments, or treated roughly by pandemic workers. Much of these posts have been quickly deleted, including an article by a leading Chinese health expert, Dr Zhong Nanshan, that cautiously urged China to move away from its zero-Covid commitment. Platforms have also censored videos of protests and outrage over the separation of Covid-positive children from their parents. A Caixin investigation on unreported deaths quickly disappeared. In one video shared online, pandemic workers appeared to be forcing their way into a man’s flat to demand he remove a critical post, while others claim to have been visited by police over their tweets. Weibo censored the term “buying vegetables in Shanghai” as people complained of food shortages (although one resident wryly noted you could still post about buying cake). By Sunday, even the first line of China’s national anthem – “Stand up! Those people who refuse to be slaves!” – had been banned as a hashtag. But the volume of forbidden posts appears to be challenging the censorship system and workers. Last week, for a few pre-dawn hours on Weibo, criticism of the state flowed unusually freely, as users flooded top two trending – and therefore sanctioned – hashtags with complaints. Under the topics “the US is the country with the largest human rights deficit” and “Shanghai handled several rumours regarding Covid”, the posts were often sarcastic or satirical, evading bans by replacing “China” with “US” in their criticism. Posts stayed online for hours, prompting one person to joke the censors must have escaped the pressures of China’s ubiquitous ‘996’ culture of overwork. Charlie Smith, the co-founder of censorship monitoring site GreatFire.com and who goes by a pseudonym, said part of the pushback could be attributed to it coming from Shanghai-ers, who he said could “afford to [more] open, because they are not as tied to Beijing”. Shanghai, China’s commercial capital, is generally richer than other parts of the country, and is home to a large middle class and cohort of China’s business and academic elite, more of whom were educated overseas. “I think that what has happened in Shanghai would not happen in Beijing,” he said. “But certainly something has changed. People have lost trust in the government, they are not likely to believe what the government tells them and they are going to question propaganda.” Smith said there were several recent events straining China’s system of censorship. “We went from the [February story of a Chinese woman found chained in a shed], to the war in Ukraine, to Covid in Shanghai in pretty rapid succession. How far do they allow people to discuss these topics in depth?” “They can’t fully censor those topics, and then the constant blaming of the US for everything seemed to break the camel’s back, so netizens turned the tables, and now the censors are scrambling.” Dong Mengyu, a journalist focused on internet censorship, said the mechanisms of censorship were the same as always but “the creativity of dissent does pose challenges for censors”. “The volume of dissent reminds me of what we saw during the early days of the Wuhan lockdown, particularly following the death of doctor Li Wenliang and the censorship of an essay about Dr Ai Fen,” said Dong. Both had been punished for speaking out about the emerging virus. Following public outcry after his death, Li was later officially lauded as a hero. In a possible sign that they needed more tools, on Friday several social media platforms announced they would soon be publishing the IP addresses of users, in order to combat “spreading rumours”. In a post from Friday, still online at the time of publication, one person hijacked the US human rights hashtag to deride a planned Chinese state media broadcast intended to “inject positive energy” by highlighting “good” elements of the lockdown. The event was later cancelled after online backlash. “The epidemic has made the Chinese see a lot more clearly,” they posted. “Chinese people are obedient, but they’re not stupid”. By Monday complaints still littered the hashtag about US human rights, as people posted photos of surveillance cameras installed in female university dormitories as a “pandemic measure”, of mocked up polls claiming people were living a harder life than anyone in Russia or Ukraine, of a dog beaten to death by epidemic workers, of the removal of all residents (without pets) from a village north east of Pudong to disinfect it after a cluster of cases. Smith said Chinese authorities used to fear simultaneous street protests breaking out across different cities would be what challenged Beijing’s hold on the population. “I’m not sure if they ever thought something similar could happen online, but it is happening.” Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin",News/World news,China internet censors scramble as lockdown frustration sparks ‘creative’ wave of dissent ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/china-internet-censors-scramble-as-lockdown-frustration-sparks-creative-wave-of-dissent
4/20/2022,"It was a gift that would change Alfonso Margarito Martínez Esquivel’s life and illuminate some of the darkest moments of Mexico’s recent history: a secondhand Canon SLR bought from a photographer called Goofy. Through its lens the Mexican photojournalist would witness his country’s slide into drug-fuelled carnage – bodies strung from bridges, dumped on sidewalks, dismembered, burned – without ever losing his trademark grin. “Margarito was a sweetie – a sweetie to everyone,” said Bibi Gutiérrez, his close friend and mentor, her voice breaking as she remembered giving Martínez one of his big breaks in journalism by buying him his first professional camera. “He was always smiling.” As the start of Mexico’s 2006 “war on drugs” plunged parts of their country into a grotesque frenzy of violence, Martínez and Gutiérrez stood together on the frontline, racing to gunfights and massacres to expose the scale of the horror. “There were corpses everywhere. Machine guns. AK-47s … it was a frightful slaughter,” Gutiérrez said of one notorious shootout where they found themselves tiptoeing around more than a dozen bodies, some people taking their final breaths. Martínez would cover countless killings over the coming years, earning his reputation as Tijuana’s premier street-level police reporter – a local legend who helped visiting journalists from around the world, including from the Guardian. Then, at lunchtime on 17 January this year, as the 49-year-old set off from his home on Tijuana’s gritty southside, the crime scene came to him. Details of what happened next are still emerging but investigators reportedly believe that as Martínez approached his car, three shots were fired. “It’s done,” the assassin’s accomplice, loitering nearby, informed the gangster suspected of ordering the hit over WhatsApp. Martínez’s teenage daughter and wife ran outside and found him in agony on the potholed road, blood gushing from his neck. “What cowards,” Gutiérrez, 57, said of her friend’s killers. “Like all of us, Margarito defended himself with a pen, a notebook, a telephone and a camera while these murderers use guns that take away your life.” As Martínez’s wife cradled her dying husband, local reporters exchanged messages questioning his unusual radio silence. “Ay Dios,” one exclaimed after confirmation of his death. “It can’t be! … Holy God … The horror … Fucking hell … What should we do?” Journalists across Mexico are asking the same question after a wave of murders targeting their colleagues in what was already one of the world’s most dangerous countries for the press. At least eight Mexican journalists have been killed this year, prompting an outpouring of anguish and anger that has been exacerbated by a politically charged feud with Mexico’s media-bashing president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (Amlo). Six days after Martínez’s slaying, another well-known Tijuana reporter, Lourdes Maldonado, was murdered outside her home. Two years earlier she had publicly told López Obrador she feared for her life. “She was cool, she never fucked around with no one,” one of Maldonado’s neighbours said as he sipped a Sunday afternoon can of watery Mexican beer near the glass-strewn spot where she was shot. “I just think, why? Why this lady? She never argued with no one,” the man added, asking not to be named for fear of being targeted himself. Martínez’s path into the increasingly perilous world of Mexican journalism began in the late 1980s when his journalist mother roped him into taking photos for her political magazine La Lucha de Las Féminas (Female Struggle). Eglantina Esquivel said she hoped journalism would keep her teenage son off the increasingly rough streets of their border city, a longtime smuggling hub on the US border which would soon become one of the most violent places on Earth. Martínez shared his mother’s thirst for news, although he preferred nocturnal “nota roja” crime reporting to politics. “It was always about getting the scoop,” Esquivel, 80, remembered at the family home overlooking Tijuana’s urban sprawl, where she has built a shrine showing her son covering someone else’s murder. After receiving his first professional camera in the early 2000s, Martínez became an inimitable chronicler of Tijuana’s intensifying narco-battles and an icon of its tight-knit journalism community, known for his generosity and good humour. “We felt we could save the world with our images. We felt like telling the story would wake people up to what was happening,” said Jordi Lebrija, a videographer who documented the explosion of violence alongside Martínez between 2007 and 2011. “Nobody knew the city like him, or understood what was dangerous and what wasn’t,” said Guillermo Arias, a photojournalist who befriended Martínez after moving to Tijuana to cover the escalating drug conflict. “He became an essential source of information and right now there’s a huge void – an information void,” Arias added. “This is the problem with the murder of journalists – it creates these vacuums.” Martínez’s work stopped short of exploring the rampant corruption and narco politics driving so much of the bloodshed. “He wasn’t trying to do any major investigating or exposing anybody. [At a crime scene] he’d get the details – the who, what, when, why. Maybe there was a witness he might interview … and then he would pull out and go to the next scene,” said Wendy Fry, a Tijuana-based correspondent for the San Diego Union-Tribune and friend. Yet the murder of eight journalists so far this year – compared with seven in the whole of 2021 – has prompted a profoundly political dispute, with many accusing Mexico’s government of failing to stop the slaughter. Some even accuse López Obrador – who has bristled at growing international condemnation of the crisis – of stoking the violence with his hostility to the media. Attacks on the press surged 85% in the first three years of Amlo’s administration, with every single Mexican state witnessing such incidents for the first time last year. “Right now the Mexican press is caught in the crossfire between the threats and bullets of narco-traffickers and organised crime and the threats and verbal attacks and attempts to morally annihilate us from the federal and state governments,” said Adela Navarro Bello, director of the Tijuana weekly Zeta and godmother to Martínez’s daughter. “Every day [Amlo] urges society to discredit the journalistic profession – and clearly we are paying the price in blood,” said Sonia de Anda, a Tijuana journalist who confronted Amlo when he travelled there a month after Martínez’s murder in an apparent effort to calm tensions. Amlo’s appearance had the opposite effect. After voicing regret, the 68-year-old populist began one of his trademark anti-media tirades, horrifying many grieving journalists who were present. “They earn huge amounts of money. They are high-level mercenaries … they don’t defend the people,” Amlo said of the conservative hacks supposedly paid to malign his historic “transformation” of Mexico. De Anda, who first encountered Amlo in the 1990s while covering his home state of Tabasco, said she was appalled by his conduct, but not surprised. “If he’s rude now, he was even worse back then … he cannot stand criticism,” she said, recalling how the then opposition leader scorned reporters he considered government stooges. “He thinks we’re corrupt sellouts who represent certain powerful groups – and he thinks it’s best that people see us as such,” said de Anda, who thought such rhetoric – coupled with almost total impunity for those who committed crimes against journalists – was endangering lives. Martínez was not an influential media “mercenary”. In fact, he was a devoted family man who lived in Camino Verde, a hardscrabble gang-run hillside ghetto where some shacks are cobbled together from demolition timber and tarps. Friends say he often struggled to fill the tank of his decrepit 20-year-old Dodge so he could reach crime scenes, photographs of which he was paid for by the piece. “He worked so hard because he needed to work so hard,” said Fry. She said friends had long worried about Martínez’s safety: “His job put him in close contact to all this danger, all the time.” Those fears sharpened last December when he was falsely accused of running Tijuana At War, a sensationalist Facebook page that unmasks cartel crooks. “That was the first time since I’d known Margarito that I could feel he was really afraid,” said Lebrija. Spooked, Martínez inquired about being included in a government protection scheme. But before that could happen, the hitmen pounced, reportedly because they erroneously believed Martínez was behind a 14 January newspaper report about “Cabo 20” (“Corporal 20”), an infamous local mobster. Hours after that story’s publication, Corporal 20’s henchmen began plotting the assassination, according to the Tijuana website Punto Norte. “I need a soldier for a murder,” one alleged criminal nicknamed El Huesos (Bones) told a triggerman called Uber two days later, offering him 20,000 pesos (£760) for the job. At about the same time Eglantina Esquivel was hugging her son for the very last time. Her wrinkled face crumpling with emotion, she remembers Martínez clutching her so tightly she gasped: “Oh son, you’ll break me!” “How could I not love you when it was I who brought you into this world?” she said as they parted. The night before his shooting, Esquivel couldn’t sleep. She shuffled out on to her balcony to contemplate the city where her child would soon be killed. “It was as though someone was warning me what would happen. I had this sense of foreboding. My inner self could feel it.” Esquivel said she struggled to fathom the psyche of her son’s executioners but was certain who was emboldening such killers. “López Obrador couldn’t care less about journalists,” the bereaved mother seethed. “We have a government that’s an enemy of journalists – that is an enemy of the pen.”",News/Media,‘Threats and bullets’: photojournalist’s killing amplifies fears for press in Mexico,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/20/margarito-martinez-esquivel-threats-and-bullets-photojournalists-killing-amplifies-fears-for-press-in-mexico
4/20/2022,"Jordan Fievez was sitting at the kitchen table of his rented home in a Picardy village, worrying about fuel prices. “Halfway through the month, I’m already overdrawn,” he said of rising bills and the cost of diesel for his 50km round trip to work. The 27-year-old works in a factory making one of France’s store-cupboard favourites, dried mashed potato mix. He is one of those workers Emmanuel Macron praised for “feeding the nation” during the Covid pandemic. But even with Macron’s €100 handout for “inflation compensation” and the government’s cap on gas and electricity prices – which has kept French prices from rising as fast as in most other European countries – Fievez felt “exhausted” by the struggle to make ends meet. With two children and a partner who earns the minimum wage at a sport shop in a distant town, “it seems like we’re working just to pay for fuel costs to get to work”, he said. In this rural area with few services, it was a 10km drive just to buy milk. Fievez says he will vote for the far-right Marine Le Pen as president this Sunday. Just over 60% of his village, Solente, had voted Le Pen in the first-round on 10 April, after her promises to lower VAT on basic goods amid the cost of living crisis. “All across the north, people can’t stand it any more, we’re barely surviving – there has to be change,” Fievez said. “Macron is the president of the rich.” The Hauts de France northern region of France, stretching from the cereal fields of Picardy through the de-industrialised former mining heartlands and up to the Calais coast, has come to symbolise both Le Pen’s support base among workers and the centrist Macron’s challenges to winning reelection on 24 April. Macron is leading the polls by 56% to Le Pen’s 44%. But, with a potentially low turnout, the gap could be far closer than when he beat Le Pen five years ago with 66%. For the first time in the more than 40-year history of the French far right, Le Pen is seen as having a distant chance of winning, in what the French government spokesperson warned this week was a risk of a “Brexit-style” earthquake. Macron, seeking to show he is not afraid of hearing people’s despair, has deliberately travelled north and east to Le Pen’s heartlands to get up close to angry voters – “within slapping distance”, as observers called it. “You’re arrogant, you look down on us, you’re cynical, machiavellian, you’re a manipulator and you’re a liar,” said one man in the Bas-Rhin who had voted Macron in 2017, but would now switch to Le Pen. “I’m very aware of the divisions in society,” Macron said in Carvin in northern France. The challenge for Macron’s canvassers was persuading voters of his improvements to the economy – that he had lowered unemployment, capped energy prices, cut taxes and begun to create more industrial jobs in France after decades of factory closures. In the northern mining town of Lens, where unemployment was at 14% when Macron took office and has now dropped to 10%, Le Pen still topped the poll in the first round. “We have a society that is fractured between the bottom of the pyramid and the top,” said Macron’s ally, François Bayrou. But the picture is more complex than a simple divide between lower-income workers choosing Le Pen and managers and pensioners choosing Macron. Pollsters warn of growing disillusionment and dissatisfaction with the political class. More than 12 million voters did not turn up to the ballot box in the first round. The bitter final fight between the pro-European, pro-business Macron and the far-right, anti-immigration, Russia-friendly Le Pen has become a contest over which candidate attracts the most hostility. The more than 7 million voters who in the first-round chose the hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon, including students, young people and low-income workers in urban areas, hold the key to the vote. Macron needs a large part of them to back him to keep back Le Pen. Some say they are too hostile to Macron to vote for him, others will abstain. Failing to turn out to vote, warned the Macron ally Christophe Castaner, was like playing “Russian roulette” with the prospect of a far-right presidency. Polling shows that Le Pen’s support is more than a simple protest vote, with growing numbers adhering to her promises to address the cost of living crisis, which is voters’ main concern and will influence the final vote. In the Picardy village of Beaulieu-les-Fontaines, Pascal Patté, 58, was another of Macron’s everyday heroes who had kept the country fed during the pandemic. He was an increasingly rare phenomenon in France: a village baker. People in lesser populated areas of France now have to travel an average of 2.2km to buy bread, the French Senate warned recently, as village shops close owing to competition from hypermarkets. “I’m at the end of my rope,” said Patté, 58, arranging the baguettes. “In the first two weeks of lockdown in 2020, I sold more than 80 baguettes a day and record amounts of flour and yeast to people who wanted to bake at home. But now I’m back to the struggle. At 7am today, I put out 15 baguettes, by 11am, I’d only sold six.” Patté is the only baker in a 12km to 15km radius and travels to put his baguettes in vending machines in other villages. “I love my profession, I started baking at 15,” he said. But with fuel prices and costs, he has had to take out a government-backed loan to stay afloat. He saw a vote for Marine Le Pen as a solution. “We have to try something different in France, we need change, we can’t go on struggling,” he said. In his village, Le Pen took 50% of the first-round vote. Théo Savard, aged 20, symbolised what Macron considers one of his key successes in five years – increasing youth training schemes. An apprentice panel-beater, Savard worked in the bodyshop of a local garage. But he too wanted change. He had seen the difficulties of the pandemic as his sister was a nurse and his mother worked in a care home for elderly people. He now worries about being able to afford to move out of his parents’ home and the petrol costs to get to work or see his girlfriend, a trainee hairdresser in a big town. He said he was open to Mélenchon’s ideas and did not share Le Pen’s anti-immigration positions or her promise to ban the Muslim headscarf. But he didn’t find her dangerous. He would vote Le Pen for change and because of her promise of zero income tax for people under 30. “When Macron came to power he was young and said he’d change things, but it seems like he’s done more for rich people than normal people,” Savard said. “It’s not about voting for extremes, it’s that people in rural areas can’t get by.” Farther north, in the Somme city of Amiens, where Macron grew up, Mélenchon had topped the first-round polls. Capucine, 23, who had a chemical engineering degree and a future in scientific research, did not vote in the first round. She was radically opposed to the far right, but also angry at Macron’s personal opposition to extending the time-limit on abortion and felt he showed “disdain” to the working class. “I think I’ll use a proxy vote because I can’t bring myself personally to touch a ballot paper with Macron’s name on it,” she said. Julie, 19, and two fellow law students outside the university buildings, had voted Mélenchon but would now vote Le Pen. “We’re too angry at Macron. He hasn’t done enough to support students. I don’t think Le Pen is a danger, she won’t actually be able to go as far as banning Muslim headscarves or changing the French constitution to lessen foreigners’ rights.” Barbara Pompili, Macron’s environment minister, who grew up in a former mining area in the north, was canvassing on the streets of Amiens about the danger of the far right. “People don’t see this election as won, there are a lot of people who are still hesitating,” she said. “I think there’s a real need to rebuild trust between the politicians and citizens on the ground.” She felt that the words “far right” would once have mobilised a kneejerk tactical vote by left and right to keep out the extremes, but that no longer worked. As she handed out leaflets, she warned that Le Pen would worsen climate change and “the far right have never brought prosperity to a country”. Unemployment in the area had dropped from 12% to 9% during Macron’s presidency, and several people voiced their support of his handling of the Covid crisis and the war in Ukraine. “It’s absolutely essential to vote Macron to keep out the far right,” said Martine, 28, who works with children with disabilities. But most often Pompili stood talking to those who intended to abstain. “Neither Macron nor Le Pen, I can’t bring myself to vote,” said a 19-year-old seeking an apprenticeship in childcare. “I’m not saying Macron is perfect, I’m saying Marine Le Pen is a catastrophe,” Pompili said. On the Pigonnier estate, in one of the poorest areas of northern Amiens, Mohammed ran a market fruit stall, and had noticed customers buying less fruit and vegetables as prices rose. He had voted Mélenchon in the first round but would now abstain. “Five years ago, I voted Macron and I was disappointed, I just can’t do it again.”",News/World news,Voters in northern France wooed by Marine Le Pen’s cost of living policies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/voters-in-northern-france-wooed-by-marine-le-pens-cost-of-living-policies
