2/9/2022,"A court has released images of the injuries sustained by a police officer only moments before he shot an Aboriginal man dead. The Northern Territory supreme court has heard Zachary Rolfe, 30, shot dead Kumanjayi Walker in November 2019 while trying to arrest him at the remote community of Yuendumu, 300km north-west of Alice Springs.  Rolfe’s trial, for the alleged murder of Walker, started in Darwin on Monday. On Tuesday, the court released some exhibits in the case to the media. Among the exhibits are images that were shown to the jury of the injuries allegedly sustained by Rolfe immediately before he shot Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man. The court has heard Rolfe shot Walker three times after he had attempted to arrest him in relation to an outstanding warrant at Walker’s grandmother’s house in Yuendumu. The court heard Walker had been asked to put his hands behind his back by Rolfe only seconds after police entered the property. But Walker pulled a pair of medical scissors from his right pocket and brought them down in a stabbing motion into Rolfe’s left shoulder. The images of Rolfe, taken the day of and the day after the shooting, show a red wound almost directly on top of his shoulder. In court, the wound was described as a “small puncture wound”. Immediately after the stabbing, Rolfe’s colleague, Constable Adam Eberl, struggled with Walker, who was shot soon after for the first time by Rolfe, the court has heard. The first shot is not subject to any charges. Prosecutor Philip Strickland SC told the Northern Territory supreme court on Tuesday that as Eberl and Walker fell on to a mattress on the floor and continued to struggle, Eberl gained control of Walker. Strickland said Erbel was on Walker, whose right arm, which had been holding the scissors, was pinned under him. Rolfe placed his left hand on Eberl’s back, and pressed his right hand, holding his Glock semi-automatic handgun, against the left side of Walker’s body, Strickland said. Rolfe then pulled the trigger twice in quick succession. It is the second and third shots that are subject to the murder charge. If a jury finds Rolfe not guilty of murder, he faces a charge of manslaughter, and if he is found not guilty of that charge, a further charge of engaging in a violent act causing death. The police officer has pleaded not guilty to all charges. The newly released images also include a photo shown to the jury of a small room where the incident took place. It occurred immediately inside the only door to the property that was accessible, Strickland has told the court. Strickland told the court Walker was confronted by police as he walked across the room, and the stabbing occurred along the wall on the left side of the room. He said the mattress where the second and third shots were allegedly fired is on the opposite side of the room, immediately to the right of the doorway, and in the corner. On Wednesday, police officers who the court has heard were threatened with an axe by Walker during a previous attempt at arresting him, are expected to give evidence in the trial. David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, said he would defend his actions as being reasonable and justifiable in the context of the danger faced by him and Erbel. Edwardson said Rolfe was acting in self-defence, and to defend the life of Erbel, when he fired the second and third shots, and his training had emphasised that “edged weapon equals gun”.",News/Australia news,Zachary Rolfe trial: photos reveal stab injury sustained by NT police officer before fatal shooting ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/zachary-rolfe-trial-photos-reveal-alleged-stab-injury-sustained-by-nt-police-officer-before-fatal-shooting
2/9/2022,"Brexit red tape has damaged Britain’s trade with the EU and the situation could worsen unless the government works with Brussels to reduce hold-ups at UK ports, parliament’s spending watchdog has said. Only hours after Jacob Rees-Mogg was appointed minister for Brexit opportunities, a report by the cross-party public accounts committee (PAC) said border checks in place since the beginning of the year had increased business costs and “suppressed” trade with the EU.  The PAC said there was a risk that the situation would worsen in September, when stricter checks are implemented by the EU and a forecast post-Covid recovery in global trade increases traffic through UK ports. Urging ministers to upgrade port systems and infrastructure, especially at Dover, the committee’s chair, Meg Hillier, said it had “repeatedly raised concerns about the impact of changes to trading arrangements on businesses of all sizes, and we remain concerned”. The warning came after a haulage industry boss said lorry drivers may have to get used to queueing for four hours at Dover on busy days. Mile-long queues of HGVs waiting to get into the crucial trade port have been a regular sight in the first weeks of 2022. Measures that force lorries to stop on the A20 to prevent Dover from becoming clogged have been implemented 20 times already this year, compared with 69 times in the whole of 2021. Rod McKenzie, executive director for policy and public affairs for the Road Haulage Association, said post-Brexit border checks “mean friction where none existed” and hauliers were becoming familiar with long delays at peak times. Under the terms of the Brexit deal negotiated by Boris Johnson in December 2020, the EU introduced full import controls in January 2022 after a yearlong transition period. The UK government intended to do the same, but has delayed three times over the last year and the PAC report said officials could not give a “complete assurance that it would not do so again”. “Much remains to be done to introduce import controls, and in particular to ensure that traders and hauliers across the 27 EU member states are ready as the controls are phased in,” the report added. As part of the upgrade, the UK must adapt port equipment and border checks by September to avoid huge disruption to holidaymakers and haulage firms when the EU switches to biometric identity checks that would force travellers to exit their vehicles. Hillier said the government claimed it would develop “the most effective border in the world” by 2025, which she described as a “noteworthy ambition”, but “it is optimistic, given where things stand today”. She added: “One of the great promises of Brexit was freeing British businesses to give them the headroom to maximise their productivity and contribution to the economy – even more desperately needed now on the long road to recovery from the pandemic. Yet the only detectable impact so far is increased costs, paperwork and border delays. “The PAC has repeatedly reported on Brexit preparedness and at every step there have been delays to promised deadlines. It’s time the government was honest about the problems rather than overpromising.” Home Office officials are in talks with the French authorities about how to operate the new controls without causing queues, but the report described them as “at an early stage”. Forecasts of the costs to businesses are expected to be lowered, though it is not clear by how much, the report said. In 2019, HMRC estimated that complying with new customs rules could cost UK and EU businesses £15bn a year. “HMRC told us in November that it had not updated its 2019 estimate, but that there are indications that the costs to businesses will be less than that estimate,” the report said. The government said it was continuing to engage with EU partners to ensure that border arrangements work.",News/Politics,"Brexit damaging trade with EU, says public accounts committee",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/09/brexit-damaging-trade-with-eu-says-public-accounts-committee
2/9/2022,"More than a fifth of girls and young women in the UK have been ‘“cyber-flashed” in the last year and a similar number have faced sexual harassment, according to a study exposing endemic internet sexual abuse. The polling of females between the age of 13 and 21 who use social media found that more than a quarter had experienced bullying and more than one in three suffered sexual harassment – behaviour against girls and women online that campaigners believe must be criminalised.  The abuse – which includes 16% of girls and women facing pressure to share naked pictures of themselves – is having a “devastating impact”, according to Angela Salt, the chief executive of Girlguiding, the charity that commissioned the research. Almost all of the 13- to 15-year-old girls who experienced the problems felt negative emotions ranging from anxiety to anger, depression and fear. Those with disabilities were significantly more likely to have experienced sexist comments, bullying and pressure to share pictures of themselves compared to those without a disability. Only 15% of the 1,002 girls and young women polled last month believe social media is a safe place for them. Eva, 11, told the Guardian she was bullied over Facebook Messenger aged nine, when school friends accused her of carrying out a sexual act with boys. “I didn’t understand,” she said. “I was really confused by what they were saying”. Her mother, Emma, said she felt “physically sick” when she found the messages. Ministers are already facing pressure to toughen up online safety legislation going through parliament. MPs on the digital, culture, media and sport committee have criticised a draft bill as not “clear and robust enough to tackle the various types of illegal and harmful content on user-to-user and search services”. “Girls and young women should be able to use the internet freely, safely and without fear,” said Salt. “Sadly, our research highlights that there is still a long way to go before this is reality, which is why we are calling on the government to ensure violence against girls and women online and its devastating impact is recognised and included within the online safety bill.” MPs have called for the bill to tackle content that is technically legal, including types of online violence against and women and girls such as tech-enabled “nudifying” of women and “deepfake” pornography, either through primary legislation or as types of harmful content covered by the duties of care of service providers. It was reported this week that “cyber-flashing” – including the sending of “dick pics” – could be criminalised through inclusion in the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which means perpetrators could be included in the sex offenders’ register in England and Wales. It is already illegal in Scotland. Eva,, from Whitby in North Yorkshire, spoke about her experience because she wants other girls to know they can tell an adult if they receive anything upsetting online. As well as being accused of sexual behaviour, her classmates also told her “if we were as ugly as you we would kill our parents and kill ourselves”. “When I saw the messages I started crying,” she said. “Usually at school they were really nice and would play with me, but when we were online and I couldn’t see their faces and we were not in real life, they would always send rude messages.” She would advise anyone being sent explicit pictures “or doing stuff you don’t like” to tell an adult. “Many girls get sent these pictures or asked for pictures,” she said. “It’s nothing to be embarrassed about.” Her mother, Emma, said that rather than banning her daughter from using social media, she took a course in how apps work and schooled Eva in how to filter and block content. She said she believes more parents need to understand the technology and spend more time checking their children’s phones. Eva said she had now moved schools and was “really good friends with people who don’t bully me online”.",News/Society," Fifth of young women and girls ‘cyber-flashed’ in past year, UK study reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/09/online-sexual-abuse-cyber-flashed-young-women
2/9/2022,"Good morning and welcome back to Five Great Reads, your carefully curated assortment of stories to provoke some thought over morning tea. I’m Rafqa Touma, filling in for Guardian Australia’s legendary lifestyle editor Alyx Gorman. If you miss her, you can binge her on Saved for Later, our online culture podcast. And if you are after breaking news, you can follow our live blog here. If not, chimps are playing doctor with crushed insects, so let us get into it.  1. ‘I was an addicted doctor, the worst kind of patient’“Addiction is a terrifying breakdown of reason,” writes Carl Erik Fisher. He is a psychiatrist and assistant professor whose drinking and drug pushed him into rehab and made him question how much we really understand about addiction’s pull between free choice and total compulsion. Notable quote: “I’m 29 years old, writing notes in a sloppy felt-tip pen (no ballpoints are allowed), trying to understand how I went from being a newly minted doctor in a psychiatry residency programme at Columbia University in New York to a psychiatric patient at Bellevue, the city’s notorious public hospital.” How long will it take to read? About 10 minutes. 2. The refugees stranded on the Belarusian-Polish borderIn August last year, a villager from Ostrowka in Poland shared two photos to Facebook. Pictured were groups of families from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraqi Kurdistan, lugging bags on backs through cornfields. They were among the first asylum seekers to enter the country from Belarus, after the Lukashenko regime offered a route into Europe. What would ensue in the following months is a Belarusian-Polish border crisis. In November last year, the humanitarian emergency reached its peak. While many asylum seekers were illegally forced back to Belarus by Polish border guards, hundreds of others escaped into the forests. Now, Guardian Australia documents their journeys in pictures. Notable quote: “Every night in the forests, there is a race between border guards and aid workers to reach the asylum seekers hidden among the trees … Many of those found in the woods can barely walk after travelling long distances on foot. Some have not eaten in days."" 3. A journalism academy at a business schoolNewsCorp Australia and Google Australia have teamed up to start the Digital News Academy through the University of Melbourne’s business school, where 250 journalists will receive nine months of training in “unashamedly” commercial journalism. Why teach journalism from a business school? The academy would teach students to do journalism that is “fit for a commercial purpose right from the moment of creation,” said Campbell Reid the inaugural head of the Digital News Academy. The concern? “That News Corp is seeking to work with the business school so as to avoid the kind of questioning culture of liberal arts and humanities faculties, It’s a reflection really of the antagonism that News Corp has had for university journalism programs over many years,” said Andrew Dodd, director of the Centre for Advancing Journalism at the University of Melbourne. 4. Chimps treating each other’s woundsChimpanzees have been observed catching insects and applying them to open wounds, in a procedure similar to humans disinfecting a cut and covering it with a Band-Aid. Scientists in the west African nation of Gabon noticed that the apes are not only treating their own wounds with insects, but are also treating their peers. The research adds to the ongoing debate around the ability of chimpanzees to observe that others need help, and to offer it selflessly. Notable quote: “It takes lot of trust to put an insect in an open wound,” said Simone Pika, a biologist at the University of Osnabruck in Germany. “They seem to understand that if you do this to me with this insect, then my wound gets better. It’s amazing.” So can animals show empathy? There are still doubts about the ability of animal species to exhibit prosocial behaviours, like selfless caring of others. But scientists say it’s a hypothesis that is worth further study. The history of Thessaloniki – the heart of Macedonia, an important trading post, and Greece’s first city of gastronomy – is a layered web of empires. Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires, all creating a vibrant melting pot of culture through the ages that defines the city’s cuisine today. Notable quote that makes me swoon for wine and food: “Walk through the central Modiano and Kapani markets to find juicy Naoussa peaches, Halkidiki olives and bright-red Florina peppers – this rich, regional produce takes its place in Greek, Jewish, Balkan and Turkish-influenced recipes. The result? A uniquely Thessalonian culinary repertoire, best enjoyed with a generous glass of local wine.”",News/Australia news,"Five Great Reads: decoding addiction, refugees in limbo, and chimps giving first aid",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/five-great-reads-decoding-addiction-refugees-in-limbo-and-chimps-giving-first-aid
2/9/2022,"OK, new attacking plan. Actually it’s the same as the old one. Basically, just give it to Allan. With 87 minutes gone at St James’ Park and Newcastle already 3-1 up Allan Saint-Maximin did what he seemed to have been doing all night, taking the ball in his own half, shrugging away a doomed Everton lunge, then gliding into space, head up, drawing every other element on the pitch into his energy field, blue shirts scattered, another Newcastle attack called into being around this single point of pure attacking will.  A pass at full gallop found Jacob Murphy in space. His shot clanked the foot of the post. By that stage Saint-Maximin had been carried off the pitch by his momentum, holding his head, waving his arms, utterly lost in the moment. What a player he is. This was not a performance of ethereal attacking craft, or free floating flair. It was hard, calculated, high‑end aggression, relentlessly and ruthlessly applied. By the end Saint-Maximin had racked up 10 dribbles, 52 touches, three shots at goal and disrupted an entire opposition 10 blue shirts drawn into his orbit, spaces freed up, a tight, suffocating game split open by that constant series of cuts. This was such a vital fixture for both teams, and indeed both clubs. The Premier League’s one real remaining note of drama is the battle to stay in it, to keep hanging on to that rising balloon. And bottom of the table is a fearful place right now, gripped with rising and falling tides, geysers, spurts of hot air, sudden cold draughts. The early exchanges were adrenal and concussive. For a while Everton looked the more obviously high-end team. There are so many handsome players in this squad: sparkly link-players; upright, striding midfielders, but only in strange, unsatisfying flickers and rarely at the same time. Everton have assembled a highlights reel squad, something you’d pick based on two hours scrolling through Euro-house soundtracked videos on YouTube. They took the lead thanks to a Jamaal Lascelles own goal made by a fine free-kick from the excellent Anthony Gordon, Everton’s sparkiest player on the night. Lascelles made amends 90 seconds later, meeting a corner with a thrilling thunk of the forehead, the ball bouncing in off Mason Holgate. And from there Saint-Maximin began to bend the game his way. Leadership in a football is so often bound up in noise and biceps-flexing physicality. The optics work. We understand this. It looks like leadership. But there is nothing braver than allowing your talent to breathe and in seizing the moment. Saint-Maximin has been an outlier in this Newcastle team for a while, a ray of light in the grey years, and the most obvious example of a player who should bloom now in that hothoused new era. But it is easy to forget that he was meant to be this good all along. Marcus Thuram talked in this month’s World Soccer about training with Saint-Maximin as a French youth team player, how outstanding his basic talent was even in that company. Aged 24, he seems utterly in command of it now. In a struggling side he has the most completed dibbles in the Premier League by a mile. Look at Newcastle’s team heat map and, despite taking 40 per cent possession, they still dominate that left flank, Saint‑Maximin country. And here he just kept coming until finally on 55 minutes another burst and a deflected cross led to Ryan Fraser forcing the ball home. Kieran Trippier added a third with a wonderful free-kick. Joe Willock and Joelinton both put in savage shifts in midfield. And Saint-Maximin remained not just the most influential player on the pitch but the most interesting. Sometimes sport does seem to be trying to tell you things. Newcastle spent more in the winter window than any other club in Europe. But in Saint‑Maximin they have a player whose bond with this place is organic and utterly authentic. He arrived at Newcastle an unfilled, slightly itinerant figure. Since then he has dug in, settled in the north-east, struggled against injuries and an unsettled backdrop but revealed himself to be a mature and hugely committed character. For all the glitzy gifts he applies his talent with a cold and ruthless hand these days, aware that if he simply keeps on running at his opponents’ tender joins he will eventually; break the game open. It was impossible not to draw some kind of comparison with Dele Alli, who made his Everton debut here, the Jack Sparrow aesthetic trimmed into a ginger‑flecked short back and sides. The sadness of Alli is a strange thing. Where does it come from? Physically he looks the same. No doubt his yardage is similar, his basic movements largely the same. He remains poker faced and rarely speaks publicly. And yet somehow every run, every missed link and dead end is shot through with a horrible poignancy, with the sense of something vital mislaid. At St James’ Park Saint-Maximin’s brilliance offered hope for whatever Eddie Howe can build from here at the neo-Newcastle; and also a kind of lesson in how to win, how to settle, how to keep on running.",Sport/Football,Saint-Maximin’s relentless brilliance brings hope for Howe’s neo-Newcastle | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/08/allan-saint-maximin-newcastle-everton-premier-league
