5/7/2022,"By definition, multiverses are everywhere. But do they really need to be quite so ubiquitous? The multiverse concept triggered a playful, pinballing game of narrative tag in the Spider-Man franchise, and unleashes an anarchic onslaught of silliness in Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s forthcoming Everything Everywhere All at Once. But in this latest outing for Benedict Cumberbatch’s Dr Strange, who is tasked with protecting dimension-hopping teen America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) from nefarious forces intent on stealing her powers, the whole multiverse business is starting to feel more like a joylessly efficient get-out card to be played whenever the screenplay finds itself written into a corner. There’s an early high point in which Strange and Wong (Benedict Wong) are forced to do battle with a monocular giant octopus, while Rachel McAdams’s Christine, whose wedding has been interrupted by the tentacled gatecrasher, simply rolls her eyes. But the fun is short-lived, courtesy of Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and director Sam Raimi’s commitment to grisly visual flourishes. Unlike movies such as Black Panther and Shang-Chi, which functioned as self-contained entities, this film requires an encyclopedic knowledge of Marvel minutiae and world-class cross-referencing skills to fully work. And who, outside the diehard fanbase, has the bandwidth for that level of commitment?",Arts/Film,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness review – one for diehard Marvel fans,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/07/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-review-one-for-diehard-marvel-fans
5/7/2022,"Lias Saoudi is the frontman of rock bands Fat White Family and the Moonlandingz. Born to an Algerian father and a British mother, he grew up in Scotland and Northern Ireland before moving to London to study at the Slade School of Fine Art. Since forming in 2011, Fat White Family have released three acclaimed albums of insalubrious post-punk and are known for their provocative live performances. Along with author Adelle Stripe, Saoudi wrote Ten Thousand Apologies: Fat White Family and the Miracle of Failure, a biography of the band published earlier this year by Orion. The Absolute Mixture: Shit Art Positive by Matthew Bown This is a compendium that’s the world’s first comprehensive book-length study of the scatological in art. It begins in the medieval period, but largely focuses on the 20th century and disgust theory. There’s an incredible amount of stuff in there: Paul McCarthy, Duchamp, GG Allin, who I’m an admirer of. Even Anish Kapoor makes an appearance. The notion of somebody setting this task upon themselves and going this deep on poo I find irresistibly heroic, in a way. Depending on what kind of guests you have round for tea or whatever, it’s the ultimate coffee-table placement – the ultimate conversation-starter. Us by Zaffar Kunial It’s an exquisite little collection of poems. It’s real close to the bone – about that kind of experience where you’re half working-class northern, half Muslim immigrant and the inevitable disconnects – things just don’t quite approximate, in a way. There’s a poem called The Word, about the way his dad speaks. There’s a strange sympathy: you’re dealing with an alien, and you’re part-alien, and everything’s inconclusive. I don’t think I’ve read anybody who manages to cut that open and dissect it so well. It’s incredibly painful, a lot of it, but there’s an ecstasy to it, in that it’s pure catharsis. Welcome to the Collectors Edition. We all collect things. Often without noticing. Open a drawer. Rummage in the pockets of your coat. How did that get in there? Other collections are more conscious: books, records, trainers, T-shirts, “likes”… What’s that all about? I have written a book called Good Pop, Bad Pop, which is based around the objects I found in the loft of a house I used to live in. Objects I collected over the course of a lifetime & then left to gather dust in the dark. Why? Am I a hoarder? Or did I think I was laying things away “for a rainy day”? What does the collecting impulse say about us humans? I decided to devote my guest-edit of the Observer’s New Review to investigating this question. Author Olivia Laing met me at the London Library & helped me collect my thoughts on this & a number of other subjects. There’s an article called “The collectors”, which explores different aspects of collecting through interviews with Peter Blake, artist Andy Holden, quilt-maker Loretta Pettway Bennett, digital archivist (& activist) Stephen Ellcock & others. Artist Jeremy Deller meets Jonny Banger, founder of Sports Banger: a rave/fashion/food bank/political activism collective whose latest clothing collection bears the label “The People Deserve Beauty”. Gallerist Sadie Coles sheds light on the motivations of art collectors in our Q&A. Plus there’s Lias Saoudi (of Fat White Family) sharing his cultural highlights in “On my radar”. A collection of domestic objects rendered in papier-mâche in “The grid”. And a birthday shout-out (in cartoon form) to the one & only David Attenborough. I want to thank Jane Ferguson & her team at the Observer for giving me this opportunity & putting everything together so it all makes sense. Julian House designed Good Pop, Bad Pop & also brought his unique graphic sensibility to bear on this edition of the New Review. Mog Yoshihara & Kelly Kiley at Rough Trade Management set up my Zoom conversations with contributors. Jeannette Lee and Kim Sion had excellent suggestions. Raina Lampkins-Fielder introduced me to the work of the Gee’s Bend quilt-makers. Chrissy Blake hosted my interview with Peter Blake. Javi Aznarez drew a wonderful cartoon. Thank you all for your help. Happy Sunday. Love, Jarvis x PS: there’s a playlist of music referred to in Good Pop, Bad Pop – you can get a sneak peek here. Sarah Davachi at L’Église Saint-Eustache, Paris I went to this gig last October. It was the most incredible setting: a church with the largest church organ in France. Sarah Davachi plays incredibly sparse ambient stuff, all layered drones with electronic and acoustic elements, but really minimalist, subtle. Sonically, for me, it’s kind of like climbing back into the womb. I had my eyes closed the whole time and I drifted into a kind of trance. I remember having a vision that I was hanging out with my Algerian grandmother, but she was a little girl, and she was showing me around the mountains in Kabylia. It was a real trip. Autobibliography by Rob Doyle It’s basically his reading history: he picks 52 books – Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Svetlana Alexievich’s The Unwomanly Face of War – and goes through his personal relationship with each of them. They’re all very fragmented, but as it proceeds it starts to descend into darker, more autobiographical sketches. So what begins as a kind of formulaic rereading ends up becoming quite shocking, exposing borderline damning bits of self-exhibition and self-laceration. But it also serves practically as an incredibly useful guide to what you might read next. Threads (Dir Mick Jackson, 1984) I thought now would be a great time for everybody to rewatch Threads, the Sheffield-based Armageddon, now that the cold war is, well, back in fashion. It’s a strange time for that to suddenly be a prospect again, like things weren’t bad enough. The fact that it’s set in Sheffield somehow really adds to the pain. I associate that accent with my mum, so there’s an inherent innocence to all the characters that makes it absolutely visceral. I think if it was more synthetic and Hollywood, it wouldn’t conjure up the same terror, but because the 80s production is a bit shoddy it feels more believable. Purple Mountains by Purple Mountains I’m in some sort of musical cul-de-sac at the moment – I’m either listening to ambient or Bob Dylan. But I thought I’d choose the last album by David Berman, from Silver Jews, released in 2019. It’s arguably the greatest suicide note in musical history – listening to the lyrics, the conclusion you draw is inevitable, meaning he must have had that in mind, that he was on the way out. It’s got to be one of the bravest, boldest records I’ve heard in years – it’s the brutal honesty combined with the acerbic wit of the lyricism that does it for me. I can’t stop listening to it.",Arts/Culture,On my radar: Lias Saoudi’s cultural highlights,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/07/on-my-radar-lias-saoudi-cultural-highlights-fat-white-family

The cast was brilliant, and what was beautiful was the fact that it wasn’t just about a same-sex relationship, it was about the coming-out and coming-to-terms part of Amy’s sexuality. It was a watercooler moment, with brilliant female characters at the heart of it. I also did the Dominic Savage drama I Am Victoria, which was very different, and very pertinent to people coming out of lockdown who were feeling anxiety, even if they hadn’t before.

5/7/2022,"High on this government’s list of bad habits is its apparent compulsion to suppress its own reports. The latest was Lord Agnew’s review into the right to roam in England’s countryside. Currently, only 8% of English land and 3% of inland water is accessible to the public; in contrast, Scots are permitted to walk, camp, cycle, swim and kayak on most of their nation’s open spaces. Agnew’s report was planned to create “a quantum shift in how our society supports people to access and engage with the outdoors”. The Treasury, however, in winding up the project, effectively re-emphasised its minister’s stated belief that “the English countryside is a place of business”. Over the coming month, beginning today at Totnes in Devon, the Right to Roam group will be protesting against England’s fiercely protective land laws in a series of creative trespass events that argue for the extension of public access to forestry, downland and green belt. The protests take aim at the most visible of the host of statutes that continue to preserve the ancient, high-walled ownership model that still governs the majority of England’s green and pleasant acres. A useful primer in those urgent issues of land reform might also be found in the polarities of two of last week’s dramatic revivals: on the one hand, Downton Abbey: A New Era, the latest instalment of Julian Fellowes’s rich-man-in-his-castle nostalgia franchise; on the other, Jez Butterworth’s Jerusalem, the most raucous of investigations into the ancient argument of who owns Britain. Mark Rylance’s question, in the voice of Jerusalem’s untameable Johnny “Rooster” Byron, facing eviction from his patch of Wiltshire land, and declaring a day of freedom to all-comers, might have made a good starting point for Lord Agnew: “What the fuck do you think an English forest is for?” I once spent a very long 45 minutes interviewing the then England manager Fabio Capello in a hotel room in Lesotho, through the medium of a pony-tailed translator and two public relations officers. Every question I asked was filtered three ways to find the blandest possible form of words from the taciturn England supremo. In the longueurs when those translations were being perfected, I had an idea for a reality show involving football managers shipwrecked together on a desert island: who, I wondered, would prevail? In the years since, it would have been hard to bet against Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola – with his unassailable mix of strategic purity and charismatic rigour – to emerge victorious from that particular jungle. The latest surreal last-gasp defeat of his team by Real Madrid in Wednesday’s Champions’ League semi-final suggested a different outcome, however. Having effortlessly mastered every Lord of the Flies survival strategy, a falling coconut would no doubt brain the Spaniard in the final act. As we all collectively chip in to the monster profits of Shell and BP, and living rooms across the country get a little colder and darker, it seems no coincidence that the philosophy of Wim Hof is near the top of the bestseller lists. Hof peddles the idea that the secret to health and happiness lies in cold showers and frigid baths. Last week, I was flicking through Hof’s book with one eye on the ever-alarming smart meter, while weighing up the cost (and vascular) benefits of a 28-day cold shower regime. How long will it be before some minister steps forward to recommend “snowga” as an antidote to the cost-of-living crisis?

5/7/2022,"Ferdinand Marcos, the dictator who ruled the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, was the nation’s most decorated hero of the second world war. Under his rule, the armed forces were the most advanced in Asia. Even more impressive: his family owns enormous quantities of gold, enough to save the world (it was given to Marcos by a royal family as payment for acting as their lawyer). It will be shared with the people if they regain power. The claims are all false. But that hasn’t stop them from echoing across social media, saturating news feeds across the Philippines. Ferdinand Marcos left office in disgrace 36 years ago, ousted by the People Power Revolution, which drew millions on to the streets and forced the family to flee the presidential palace by helicopter. But tomorrow, the Marcos family is poised to make its comeback. Some 67.5 million Filipinos will go to the polls to decide who should replace the populist president Rodrigo Duterte who has reached the end of his six-year term and is barred from running again. Marcos’ only son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, known as Bongbong, is favourite to be elected – opinion polls put him far ahead of Leni Robredo, a former human rights lawyer and the current vice-president. A recent survey by Pulse Asia suggests he is the preferred candidate of 56% of voters; Robredo is favoured by just 23%. Analysts have decribed the race as a struggle over the truth, and the culmination of a decades-long campaign to rewrite history and rehabilitate the Marcos name. The election is not being fought just with data and evidence, said Ronald Mendoza, dean of Manila’s Ateneo School of Government: “It’s a battle of disinformation.” The Marcoses and their supporters have sought to revise the story of their era and of martial law imposed in 1972, often described as one of the most painful episodes in the country’s history. They deny or dismiss the widespread torture documented by rights groups, the extrajudicial killings and the plundering of billions of dollars. Instead, the period is portrayed as a golden age of peace and prosperity. For survivors of the Marcos regime, the acceptance of such accounts by significant sections of the public is incomprehensible. “If ever he wins, he will be winning on the basis of false narratives and historical distortion,” said Bonifacio Ilagan, convenor of Campaign Against the Return of the Marcoses and Martial Law. “I lived through the military dictatorship. I have been imprisoned twice. I have been tortured. I had my sister disappeared and most probably killed, friends suffering the same. And now Marcos Jr is making a comeback. It is horrible. It is like a nightmare,” he said. Partnerships have formed to tackle false online claims, including #FactsFirstPH, formed by media outlets such as Rappler, which was cofounded by Nobel laureate Maria Ressa, which has joined with church groups, researchers and others. Tsek.Ph, a coalition of universities, journalists and civil society groups, also corrects false claims on soical media online. “Every day we sift through this tsunami of disinformation, and decide which ones to fact check. There are just too many,” says Maria Diosa Labist, associate professor at the University of the Philippines’ Department of Journalism, and a coordinator of Tsek.Ph. Tsek.Ph runs a tipline where the public can report questionable posts, while researchers also sift through social media for viral disinformation. Its analysis shows that both Robredo and Marcos have been the subject of false claims. But disinformation about Robredo has been overwhelmingly negative, questioning her competence and character. Of the false claims about Marcos, almost all sought to enhance his image, or that of his family. Many relate to his father’s era: for example, wrongly claiming that no Marcos critics were arrested during martial law, or that all ill-gotten wealth cases against the family have been dismissed. On TikTok and YouTube, accounts aligned to Marcos seek to glamorise the dynasty, with montages of archive footage, and clips of his sons who are adored by a younger supporter base. “Marcos Jr himself, his political career and accomplishment aren’t really impressive,” said Fatima Gaw, assistant professor of communication research at the University of the Philippines College of Mass Communication. His appeal hinges on his promise to restore his father’s legacy, which is the centre of online campaigns. At a recent Marcos concert in Bulacan, the mood was nostalgic. The crowd, dressed in Marcos red, sang along to 70s and 80s rock songs. Attendees spoke fondly of the past. “His father did a lot of things [for the Philippines]. He built highways, bridges, hospitals,” said Zenaida Catindig, 59. Catindig does not believe the Marcos family stole money from the Philippines. “If there’s a case, they should be in jail right now. They’re not in prison. Why are they free, if they are corrupt?” she said. The family has faced a raft of cases, and it has been ruled at home and internationally that the Marcoses possessed ill-gotten wealth. Marcos Jr’s mother, Imelda, infamous for her collection of 3,000 pairs of shoes, is appealing a 2018 criminal conviction on seven graft charges. John Agbayani, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government, which was set up to investigate and recover the Marcos family’s funds, told Reuters last week that it had retrieved about $5bn, and that a further $2.4bn was bogged down in litigation. More remains missing. Despite such evidence, supporters are unconvinced. “The Marcos family was wealthy even before they entered politics,” said Catherine Dayao, a 22-year-old student attending the Bulacan concert. Marcos was a lawyer for a royal family, she said. Her brother, a history teacher, told her. “I can see in him the qualities of his father,” Dayao said, explaining his appeal. “Bongbong will bring back discipline to Filipinos.” Surveys suggest Marcos is the preferred candidate among all age groups. However, analysts point to the large number of younger voters in the Philippines, who have no memory of martial law. “There is exposure to disinformation even at very young ages,” said Mendoza. “They appear to have planted the seeds for future success.” Ensuring there is factually accurate information about the Marcos era should become increasingly crucial even for future elections, he said. Filipinos have ranked at the top of global surveys for time spent on social media, increasing the country’s vulnerability to disinformation. Social media platforms were manipulated by president Duterte as he campaigned for election in 2016, and have been weaponised to silence criticism of his administration. One Facebook official described the country as “patient zero” in a fake news crisis that has grown to threaten democracies around the world. Yet researchers say that what is happening now is far more organised and insidious than Duterte’s troll farms. In 2016, the Philippines was experiencing the mere infancy of disinformation campaigns, said Gaw. “Fast forward six years from then and we see there’s actually a whole supply chain that performs this information work for the Marcoses,” she said. If a criticism of Marcos Jr is reported in mainstream media, a counter narrative is quickly provided by a network of online influencers, Gaw said, describing the system as far more industrialised. Proving that such accounts are funded by the Marcos family, or determining the size of the misinformation business is challenging. But it is clear that spreading misinformation is easy work, and it pays, adds Gaw. “It’s so profitable that even if you don’t believe in Marcos Jr you would promote him.” Marcos Jr has denied the existence of any organised disinformation campaign. However, in January, Twitter suspended hundreds of accounts that were promoting his campaign for violating its rules on spam and manipulation. Researchers in the Philippines have long accused social media companies of failing to take online misinformation seriously, and of allowing their platforms to be exploited. While Filipinos are among the most keen users of social media globally, these platforms have moderation policies designed with a western perspective, prioritising areas such as alt-right content, said Gaw. “In the Philippines there’s really no alt-right version of things. It’s just different political families battling for power.” Tsek.ph does not have a special arrangement with platforms to remove false content, though some members are accredited as third-party fact checkers with Facebook. Of the posts the Tsek.ph coalition reports, it has no idea how many are removed. Stories often reappear and move between different social media sites. Often, claims have been circulating for years and become entrenched within some online communities. Trying to counter such beliefs, in a country where the media has been maligned, threatened and harassed, is an uphill battle. Ilagan fears the election of Marcos Jr would curtail freedoms, and scupper efforts to regain the family’s ill-gotten wealth. It would also further distort democracy, he said. “I think the Marcoses planned the whole thing since they were ousted from the presidential palace. They had all the time, and all the money to design a comeback.” “How can democracy be true when a handful decides the fate of the greater majority?” Additional reporting by Lorna Bayani",News/World news,Philippines election: Bongbong poised to become president as Marcos history is rewritten,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/philippines-election-bongbong-poised-to-become-president-as-marcos-history-is-rewritten
5/7/2022,"At the height of Hong Kong’s protests in the summer of 2019, angry pro-democracy legislators shouted in the Chinese territory’s legislative council: “down with John Lee!”, as the veteran security chief defended his force’s treatment of the protesters and journalists. “I hope people will understand the chaotic situation and the pressure faced by each and every one at the scene on that day,” Lee said, unapologetically. “I hope members of the public will not vent their dissatisfaction of the government on police officers, because they are only discharging their duties.” On Sunday Lee, 64, who built a long career in police and security and oversaw the the heavy-handed crackdown on anti-Beijing protesters in 2019, is set to become Hong Kong’s new chief executive in a single-candidate selection process to succeed Carrie Lam. Like Lam, he was among the first Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials to be on the US sanctions list for their role in eroding the city’s once-guaranteed rights and freedoms. But despite the controversy, by the time the leadership poll takes place more than half of the nearly 1,500 people selected to cast ballots would have already showed their support to Lee – guaranteeing him victory. “By picking John Lee as the candidate without competition, Beijing is sending a message to the outside world,” said Ho-fung Hung, a Hong Kong-born professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins and the author of the book City on the Edge: Hong Kong Under Chinese Rule. “The message is that Beijing has cemented control and will continue its tough policy in Hong Kong,” he said. Lee joined Hong Kong’s police force as an inspector in 1977. He rose through the ranks and, in 2017 became the head of the government’s Security Bureau. Like many of his peers, he speaks fluent English and was educated abroad, holding a master’s degree in public policy and administration from Charles Sturt university in Australia. In the last few years, Lee has shown his staunch support for Article 23 – the controversial national security law that was passed in 2020. The legislation bars secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces. Since its enactment, dozens of pro-democracy legislators have either been arrested or have moved abroad. Au Nok-hin, who led the chanting of “Down with John Lee” in that council session three years ago, was among the 55 members of the opposition who were arrested under the national security law last year. Lee’s opponents worry that the former security tsar would eventually turn Hong Kong into another mainland Chinese city by further eroding its once-proud traditions – for example, of press freedom. Last year Lee oversaw the freeze of media tycoon Jimmy Lai’s assets, which eventually led to the closure of one of the city’s most popular pro-democracy tabloid newspapers, Apple Daily. In November Lee told RTHK, the local public broadcaster, that the government was looking into “different tactics” to target “fake news” through legislation. A few months before, the city’s new police chief, Raymond Siu, called for a “fake news” law to tackle “hostility against the police”. Despite being a sole contender for the top job, Lee has in the past weeks been seen making policy pledges and receiving a growing number of supporters from the city’s establishment. On 20 April 148 high-profile figures, including tycoon Li Ka-shing and film star Jackie Chan joined his campaign as advisers. Lee is widely seen as a “dependable and devoutly loyal” figure to Beijing. Dissenting voices have largely disappeared following last year’s electoral changes that allowed only “patriots” in legislature polls. Before the December vote, Lee warned that candidates who had been banned from running for failing the “patriots” criteria would try to thwart the elections. “We have to make sure that they will not succeed,” he said. Analysts say that stability and security will be Lee’s main focus. In a closed-door rally on Friday, Lee met with more than 1,000 local figures who will vote and urged the public to have a “collective mindset”. His supporters also praised him for “helping Hong Kong to restore order from chaos”. According to a 44-page manifesto published last week, Lee’s priority would be to enact Article 23 of the city’s constitution. Previous Hong Kong administrations had repeatedly tried – but failed – to make it happen. “But whether he would enact Article 23 is a moot point”, said Prof Steve Tsang, a Hong Kong politics expert at SOAS in London. “This is because the state security apparatus is already in place through the national security legislation. Therefore, there’s no guarantee they’d end up doing that.” Hung said that Lee’s security background inevitably sends a strong message, but looking at the dynamics between Hong Kong and Beijing over the course of the Covid outbreak in the city earlier this year, one could also see the ultimate limit to Beijing’s sway in the city. “It seems to me that Beijing still has not decided how to strike a balance between security and maintaining Hong Kong’s unique role as an offshore financial centre. The tug-of-war is going to continue for some time under Lee’s watch,” he added.",News/World news,Security chief who led pro-democracy crackdown set to be Hong Kong’s new leader,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/security-chief-who-led-pro-democracy-crackdown-set-to-be-hong-kongs-new-leader

Huddersfield, meanwhile, claimed third place with a 2-0 win against Bristol City as Nottingham Forest dramatically drew 1-1 at Hull. Brennan Johnson’s stoppage-time penalty against the Tigers appeared to have snatched third place for Forest at the last, before Keane Lewis-Potter’s equaliser two minutes later denied Steve Cooper’s side. Fulham are promoted to the Premier League as champions despite signing off with a 4-0 reverse against the Blades at Bramall Lane, while Bournemouth, having already secured the second automatic promotion place, defeated Millwall 1-0 at Vitality Stadium with a winner from Kieffer Moore. The lineup for the playoffs, as a result, is Nottingham Forest v Sheffield United and Huddersfield v Luton, with the two-legged semi-final ties taking place from 13-17 May. The final will take place at Wembley on Sunday 29 May. Luton’s 1-0 victory against Reading at Kenilworth Road means they finish five points ahead of seventh-placed Boro, who were beaten 4-1 at Deepdale by Preston North End, with Emil Jakobsen netting twice and Alan Browne and Dael Fry also scoring for the hosts. 😳 ""EXTRAORDINARY SCENES!""Look away Ørjan Nyland...It's a gift for #LTFC and Harry Cornick gives his side the lead just before half-time! 💥 pic.twitter.com/6daqgMPnCh Harry Cornick’s opportunistic effort, when he caught the Reading goalkeeper Ørjan Nyland off-guard after lurking behind him as he prepared to clear downfield, proved the difference for the Hatters but with other results going their way, a draw or defeat would have seen them progress to the playoffs. The champions Fulham suffered a notable hangover after sealing the league title as Morgan Gibbs-White, Iliman Ndiaye and Sander Berge put Sheffield United 3-0 up by half-time, before Enda Stevens added a fourth after the break. Harry Toffolo and Danny Ward were the scorers for Huddersfield as they grabbed third place from Forest, who would have finished third on goal difference had they kept out Hull’s equaliser deep into stoppage time. Blackburn’s 2-1 away win against Birmingham City secured eighth place on goal difference ahead of Millwall. John Buckley and Ben Brereton put Rovers 2-0 up at half-time before Kristian Pedersen gave Birmingham hope with 12 minutes remaining. Elsewhere, Karlan Grant’s double helped West Bromwich Albion to thrash Barnsley 4-0. Grant opened the scoring with a penalty eight minutes before half-time before Adam Reach and Matthew Clarke adding the second and third goals respectively. But Grant missed the chance of a hat-trick when Jack Walton made a fine save to keep out his second spot-kick on 69 minutes. The relegation places were already sealed with Derby, Peterborough and Barnsley all dropping to League One, with an eight-point gap between Derby in 22nd and Reading in 21st.
