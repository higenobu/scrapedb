1/7/2022,"Peter Bogdanovich was the blazing night-sky comet of the New Hollywood generation whose trajectory got knocked off course a little, by personal tragedy and the contingencies of show business, but kept hurtling onwards with brilliant work and passionate cinephilia to the very end. His first four hits, Targets (1968) The Last Picture Show (1971), What’s Up Doc? (1972) and Paper Moon (1973) were somehow both thrillingly and authentically modern and yet also instantly belonged to the classic pantheon. With the touch of restless young genius, he seemed to reinvent pulp crime, the western, the road-movie and the screwball comedy – in short order.  I remember Bogdanovich in 2018, frail and unwell as he then reportedly was, dominating the Venice Film Festival with two important movies showing there: his superb documentary about Buster Keaton (whose reputation and importance he typically boosted for the 21st century) and his edited, “salvaged” account of Orson Welles’s lost, sprawling movie The Other Side Of The Wind, in which Bogdanovich himself starred, satirising the trauma of the Hollywood old guard in having the baton prised from their grasp by the young Turks. And Bogdanovich sat at Welles’s feet, the way Truffaut sat at Hitchcock’s, and perhaps consciously assumed the mantle of the sorcerer’s apprentice, although learned the way all Welles’s associates learned, how capricious and hurtful Welles could be. But in his later years, taking a creative comfort in well-crafted comedy in the classic Hollywood style, he found himself being supported and bankrolled by younger protégés like Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach who were as awestruck by Bogdanovich as he himself once was of John Ford and Howard Hawks.I myself met him only once, at a lunch in London’s Soho to launch his very good and underrated film The Cat’s Meow in 2004, about the mysterious true-crime “Hollywood Babylon” story about the death of a film mogul aboard WR Heart’s yacht in 1924. He was elegant, smart – a great lover of London – and very funny on the subject of being recognised for his TV acting role as the therapist of Dr Jennifer Melfi in HBO’s The Sopranos and therefore the psycho-analytical grandfather of Tony Soprano himself.Targets was a fascinatingly strange, experimental, underrated and misunderstood work which absorbed the defiant energy of countercultural cinema, with the pulp violence of Gun Crazy or In Cold Blood or Reservoir Dogs. In one plot strand, horror icon Boris Karloff plays something like himself; in the other plot, a kid becomes obsessed with guns and creating some real horror. The simple association was elegant, ingenious, equal to the meta-horror playfulness that became fashionable thirty years later. The Last Picture Show is a glorious and authentic American film, set in a windblown Texan town where the town’s dying movie theatre (even in 1971, there was agonising about the death of movie theatres, when terrestrial television and televised sports were the supposed culprits) is showing Howard Hawks’s Red River as its final film. A young kid has an affair with a melancholy older woman – magnificently played by Cloris Leachman. Cybill Shepherd (with whom Bogdanovich was to fall in love) is unforgettably stylish. There is much small town gossip and sexual tension, culminating in a quite extraordinary nude swimming scene, staggering for its calm candour, beyond eroticism, and quite unequalled by anything more or since.In Paper Moon (another piece of Americana in black-and-white) Bogdanovich gave us one of the greatest odd couples in history and the most poignant adult-child turn since Charlie Chaplin and Jackie Coogan. Ryan O’Neal and his real-life daughter Tatum O’Neal are the daddy-daughter grifter team drifting across the Depression-era midwest tricking people out of their money with cons long and short and revealing only their own self-deception and hollowed-out lives. Bogdanovich elicited an eerily good performance from Tatum in particular.Bogdanovich gave his love of comedy free play in What’s Up Doc? with Ryan O’Neal and Barbra Streisand, those quintessential 70s movie stars, and showed that he could construct and control the energies of comedy (as difficult as anything he had done up until then, but less likely to be critically approved, although this film did very well.)The low point of Bogdanovich’s life came with the murder of the actor Dorothy Stratten, who was starring in his film They All Laughed (1981) with whom Bogdanovich was in a relationship, by the man to whom she was married, but separated. Bogdanovich all but ruined himself financially finishing the film which was not surprisingly tainted in the public mind by its grim history, and Bogdanovich found himself criticised for being a part of the misogynist macho culture of movie-making of which Stratten was the victim, a sentiment not entirely mollified by the fact that Bogdanovich married Stratten’s sister Louise who became his producing partner. Bogdanovich found his comeback – though perhaps nothing like the streak of pure inspiration with which he began his career – in 1985, with the bold and heartfelt emotional drama, pointedly entitled Mask, which gave Cher a chance to prove that she was an excellent actor. It was based on the true story of a boy with a challenging craniofacial disorder. Cher played his mother, toughly confronting those who can’t appreciate her son’s inner intelligence and humanity and Eric Stoltz played the boy himself in makeup (in 2022, there would be much more of a debate about appropriate casting).Though plagued with financial worries for a very great deal of the 80s and 90s, Bodganovich kept teaching and writing and working, making an amiable stab in his mid-70s at farce with his She’s Funny that Way. But his late masterpiece was The Great Buster: A Celebration in 2018, his inspired tribute to Keaton and The Other Side Of The Wind, which almost deserves now to be considered a co-creation with Welles’s spirit.Bogdanovich was a native cinema genius, who in his heyday made great films as easily as breathing.",Arts/Film,Peter Bogdanovich: a loving cineaste and fearless genius of cinema | Peter Bradshaw,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/peter-bogdanovich-a-loving-cineaste-and-fearless-genius-of-cinema
1/7/2022,"Women of the Movement, an ABC anthology series on the often overlooked or under-appreciated women of the American civil rights movement, opens with tears of agony – that of a young Mamie Till (Broadway star Adrienne Warren), a black woman whose labor pains are dismissed by a white nurse in a sterile 1941 hospital. It’s indicative of the road ahead, for a series following the brutal, racist murder of Mamie’s son, Emmett, by two white men in Mississippi, 1955, through Mamie’s grief-fueled activism and the eventual acquittal of his killers. But Women of the Movement, crucially, begins with the joy of life: first infant Emmett, cherished by his mother, then the young man whose killing inflamed the country.  This first of a six-part installment, created by Marissa Jo Cerar (The Handmaid’s Tale) and executive produced by Jay Z and Will Smith, jumps from 1941 to the summer of 1955 in Chicago, where Mamie lives with Emmett (Cedric Joe), a charming, soft-hearted boy believably on the cusp of childhood and adolescence, in relative comfort. The series proceeds with the strict chronology and sign-posting of a network procedural. Emmett, hungry for adventure, wants to visit his great-uncle Mose (Glynn Turman) in the Mississippi Delta rather than hang with his mom and her doting boyfriend Gene (Ray Fisher); Mamie is hesitant, fearful of Emmett’s naïveté regarding the customs of the deep Jim Crow south, but she relents. They poignantly hug goodbye at the train station. Pilot director Gina Prince-Bythewood plays the fateful encounter between Emmett and grocery cashier Carolyn Bryant (Julia McDermott), a white woman, ambiguously enough to reflect existing question marks – we don’t see what Emmett says to her, there is a wolf-whistle but it’s unclear who it’s from or to – while remaining crystal clear on the dynamics: Emmett, playful and kind, acting innocently; Carolyn, bound by a code of hatred and fear, reacting ominously in anger. By the end of the first episode, Emmett has been snatched from his bed by Carolyn’s husband Roy (Carter Jenkins) and his half-brother, JW Milam (Chris Coy) and taken away in a truck, never to be seen alive again. The remaining five episodes play as a combination of network procedural and educational biopic (with attendant on-the-nose dialogue and production values), focusing on Mamie’s frantic search for her son, defiance that his mutilated body be hidden from the public, and refusal to let the presumed injustice of the south carry the day without a fight. “Let the people see what they did to my boy,” she famously said upon viewing his unrecognizably beaten face, a line Warren, who at times plays Mamie with a theater actor’s overemphasis, cast with a deep reserve of resilience. At its best, Women of the Movement provocatively explores a chapter of American history most don’t know enough about with sensitivity, faithfulness, and care not to exploit trauma. Directors Julie Dash, Tina Mabry and Kasi Lemmons emphasize the constant presence of the clicking camera flash and throng of reporters surrounding Mamie, a hounding familiar to modern viewers but perhaps not to this story. The series is strongest when embedded in the daunting, thorny work of activism with such real-life figures as Medgar Evers (Tongayi Chirisa), TRM Howard (Alex Désert), Simeon Booker (Miles Fowler), and Ruby Hurley (Leslie Silva), the NAACP’s south-east chapter head whose nascent friendship with Mamie, as one of the few female leaders, would’ve made a fascinating dual pole to the series. Instead, its perspective unsuccessfully veers into the white southerners who conduct the trial in Mississippi, with a particularly unsure handling of the killers (who confessed to the murder in a 1956 interview, a year after their acquittal). At times, we’re privy to the Bryants’ private lives – when Roy confronts Carolyn about the store encounter, when JW suggests to Roy they go after the n-word who did “all that talk at the store”, when Carolyn frets about what to wear and say the day of her testimony – moments which barely (and comfortably) humanize them and which Mamie couldn’t possibly know. There’s a version of this story which digs into the Bryants’ hatred and draws deep enough characterizations to prevent viewers from dismissing them as simply bigoted villains from a different era. But that feels beyond the scope and interest of this show, which is supposed to center Mamie and I wish it had kept the murderers to within her perspective – contemptuous, hateful figures she sees in the press and in the courtroom, devoid of empathy or regret. Cutting down on the mechanics of a trial with a foregone conclusion, the bulk of the series’ middle, could’ve opened space for some of the show’s more intriguing elements: the generational divide between Mamie and her mother Alma (Tonya Pinkins); the pressure the NAACP puts on Mamie, a private citizen reeling from unimaginable tragedy, to speak publicly; tensions between the witnesses of the Till kidnapping and murder, poor Mississippi sharecroppers with every reason to fear any attention, and the activists and lawyers seeking justice. These are reasons to trust the creators’ vision, even if it frustratingly strays from the woman at the center in its first outing.

1/7/2022,"The Guardian has been awarded investigation and journalist of the decade in relation to articles on offshore finance and the Windrush scandal. The awards were made by the media industry publication Press Gazette to mark 10 years of its British Journalism Awards ceremony. Past attendees and newsletter subscribers were asked to vote.  Amelia Gentleman was named journalist of the decade after she exposed the Windrush scandal. Her reporting showed how people legally resident in the UK were losing access to benefits, being made homeless and facing detention or deportation. The scandal – which often affected individuals who had come to the UK from the Caribbean as children but lacked paperwork – led to the resignation of the home secretary, Amber Rudd. Press Gazette’s judges said: “Amelia’s work exposing the scandalous treatment of Windrush immigrants was astonishing. It set the agenda for weeks and brought down a home secretary (even though the policy came straight from Mrs [Theresa] May). The detail and the case studies were brilliant and everyone followed this story up.” Investigation of the decade went to the Guardian and BBC for their joint work on the Panama Papers, an enormous leak of data from the secretive offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca, which was shared through the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Press Gazette’s verdict said: “The Guardian revealed secret billion-dollar deals linked to Vladimir Putin and David Cameron’s links to a secret offshore fund. This was another vast investigation by the Guardian which shone a light in some of the darkest corners of international finance.” The Guardian’s work on the HSBC Files, which revealed the bank’s use of tax havens to avoid paying tax, was also nominated for investigation of the decade. Scoop of the decade went to the Times for its work exposing sexual misconduct by Oxfam workers in Haiti. The Guardian was also nominated in this category for its reporting on Dominic Cummings breaching lockdown restrictions to drive to Barnard Castle during the first pandemic lockdown.",News/Media,Guardian wins investigation and journalist of the decade awards,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/06/guardian-wins-investigation-and-journalist-of-the-decade-awards
1/7/2022,"If the Tory party could be summed up in a word, it would be power. The Conservatives have dominated the 19th, 20th and – so far – 21st centuries. Their most successful leaders have anticipated the national mood and shaped their party to profit from it. Boris Johnson won the last election by betting the right way on Brexit. But there is a fundamental disagreement at the heart of the Tory party as to what the future UK economy outside the EU should look like. This question urgently needs an answer, not least as the country looks past the pandemic. In the next six months Britain will almost certainly face a cost-of-living crisis. High inflation may go even higher before it ebbs away. Mr Johnson is in denial about this problem while people face going cold and hungry in their homes. Prices are driven higher by global energy costs, set by cartels such as Opec or gas producers such as Russia. However, the price at which electricity and gas is supplied to the UK’s companies and households could be capped and a windfall tax on oil companies used to reimburse suppliers. State intervention could help ordinary households – but ministers say that this would be at the expense of “this country’s reputation as a hub of international capital and investment”.  The government could also permanently reduce bills for the long term by insulating homes. A bold move would be to redesign the electricity market so that gas no longer sets the price, and instead, as the government’s former adviser Michael Grubb suggested, “direct consumer access to cheaper, low-carbon electricity”. Yet nothing is done as the prime minister is hemmed in by a growing anti-green bloc of backbench MPs determined to stop a net zero transformation of the economy from taking place. When the pandemic started, the competition watchdog asked ministers for price-gouging powers. Instead of being able to effectively penalise offenders, the regulator has had to rely mostly on the limited competition and consumer laws. Many firms are putting up prices because they can. Banks, housebuilders and oil companies have all reported bumper profits in recent months while many voters have sunk into debt. For all the talk of a big-government faction in his party, Mr Johnson won’t step in to help hard-pressed families. Britain is experiencing not an unemployment crisis but a participation crisis. There are a million fewer workers than there would have been had the previous trend of more people entering the labour market continued. Some of that is down to Brexit, but mostly it is because workers, especially low-paid ones, are dropping out – unable to get to the jobs they want because of inadequate transport or a lack of affordable childcare. Gathering dust on the government’s shelves is a report with a host of sensible suggestions to deal with this festering problem. Mr Johnson seems incapable of resolving the tensions that he created to win the last election so convincingly. He seems uninterested that people can’t afford the basics in life. A decade of Tory rule has reduced the infrastructure of people’s lives so that it can barely support them. Instead of solutions, Britain has to endure the pin-striped populism of Jacob Rees-Mogg, who disguises his agenda of keeping wealth untaxed with a call to bestow a tax cut on workers, an unsubtle jab at cabinet rival Rishi Sunak. A tax rise that wouldn’t contribute to a cost-of-living crisis would be equalising capital gains with income tax. But no one in cabinet would agitate for that. Mr Johnson sold voters on the idea that he was going to create a high-wage economy using the market’s ability to root out inefficiency. But he has not delivered. Meanwhile the country is lurching from crisis to crisis with no plan to fix the root cause of our problems.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s Britain: lurching from crisis to crisis | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/06/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-britain-lurching-from-crisis-to-crisis
1/7/2022,"As grim as the crisis in Kazakhstan already appears, it could soon look much worse. Authorities reported on Thursday that dozens of protesters and at least 12 members of the police and security forces were dead. With the internet largely blocked and other communications severely hampered, and with reports of gunfire in Almaty, the country’s largest city, the true toll may be much higher. At least 2,000 protesters have been arrested. After days of largely peaceful demonstrations across the vast country, government buildings have been stormed or set on fire in two cities and witnesses in Almaty have reported looting. “Peacekeeping troops” from a Russian-led military alliance have arrived. The unrest was sparked when the cost of liquefied petroleum gas almost doubled after the authorities lifted price caps – and soon spiralled. Modest concessions did not address the deeper grievances: corruption in a nation rich in oil, where many still struggle to get by while the elite cream off the cash, and the authoritarianism of a post-Soviet state that has never held a free and fair election.  The protesters’ numbers and cries of “Old man, out!” have seen off Nursultan Nazarbayev, who led from independence until 2019 and then remained a powerful force behind his chosen successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. Mr Tokayev has now removed his predecessor as head of the country’s security council and replaced his government with an interim administration, but shows no sign of addressing more fundamental demands for political reform. The lack of protest leaders with whom he might negotiate is the inevitable outcome of the regime’s intolerance of opposition. Mr Tokayev, without offering evidence, blames “foreign-trained terrorist gangs” for the unrest, seeking to justify a punitive response. But while force may crush protests, it can only magnify the underlying anger. Calling on the Collective Security Treaty Organization is a particularly risky move – possibly suggesting that Mr Tokayev is shaken by reports of security personnel going over to the side of the protesters, or that he is worried about other parts of the elite. As well as tacitly conceding his weakness, calling in Moscow’s help is likely to alienate many in a country that prided itself on its “multi-vector” foreign policy. The alliance of post-Soviet states has not intervened in a crisis before, but Russia (like Kazakhstan’s other powerful neighbour China) wants stability on its borders and does not want street protests to overthrow another government in the region. The west has limited influence, but is not without leverage. Large sums of Kazakh money are sequestered in London (where “British professional service providers enable post-Soviet elites to launder their money and reputations”, a stinging Chatham House report noted last month). Anti-corruption campaigners have rightly urged that as the rich and well-connected flee, law enforcement agencies, financial institutions and service providers should be watching carefully and reporting, freezing and seizing assets as appropriate. The US, EU and UK should also do their utmost to urge the leadership to respect protesters’ rights.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Kazakhstan’s unrest: danger ahead | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/06/the-guardian-view-on-kazakhstans-unrest-danger-ahead
1/7/2022,"Britain’s first wave of coronavirus raised the risk of death by more than 40% for most adults regardless of their underlying health and other factors, research suggests. Scientists examined medical records for nearly 10 million people aged 40 and over and found that, whatever a person’s risk of dying before the pandemic, it rose 1.43 times on average as the virus spread between March and May 2020.  The finding means that Covid amplified people’s pre-existing risks by a similar amount, leading those most vulnerable before the pandemic to bear the brunt of the deaths. “Covid-19 seems to have multiplied the death rate by a similar amount for most adults in the UK,” said Dr Helen Strongman, an epidemiologist on the study at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “It really exploits any frailty or health or demographic risk factor. It picks on people who are already at risk of ill health or death more than other people in the population.” The researchers compared relative rates of all-cause mortality before and during the first wave, taking into account the impact of 50 different medical conditions and other characteristics, such as where people lived, their body mass index and ethnicity. While the first wave of Covid multiplied the risk of death by a similar amount for most people, there were stark exceptions. Mortality rates for those with dementia and learning disabilities rose from three times higher than background levels to five times higher. Meanwhile, the death rates for people of colour and people living in London, which were lower than those of white people and people living outside the capital respectively before the pandemic, increased during the first wave. Strongman said the work, which is published in Plos Medicine, reinforced the importance of protecting the most vulnerable. “No one is completely detached from someone who is frail or in poorer health and therefore at higher risk,” she said. In a separate UK study, researchers found that countries with high levels of trust generally fared better than others at bringing Covid infections and deaths down from their peak levels. As the Covid pandemic took off, countries brought in measures to tackle rising infections and deaths, with many resorting to lockdowns. The measures quickly brought down such levels in some countries, but not in others. “Even if they’re the same measures, they’re not always being obeyed to thge same degree in different places,” said Prof Tim Lenton, the director of the global systems institute at the University of Exeter and a co-author of the study. The research, published in Scientific Reports, looked at more than 150 countries’ resilience to Covid – the rate at which daily cases or deaths fell from peak levels – in 2020. It also explored the stringency of government measures in the countries, based on the Oxford Covid-19 government response trackers, and levels of trust using the World Values Survey. The results show higher resilience to Covid in countries where the stringency of government interventions increased from a low background level in the face of a new wave of Covid, and the level of trust in each other was high – in other words there was a strong “social contract”. Lenton said that in every country where trust is about 40% or higher the peaks were reduced to very low levels of cases and deaths, including in the UK, where trust is near that threshold. “The UK is not a roaring success … and yet once we had managed to peak-out and we got on the decline curve, we actually are a case where we seem to have just enough trust to have really successfully brought the waves down,” he told the Guardian. “Success with this awful pandemic appears to be more hinging on trust in each other than trust in government, which is probably a damn good thing given where we’re at with trust in government,” he added. Stephen Reicher, a member of the Sage subcommittee on behavioural science and a professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews, said the findings fit with evidence that a sense of community identity is a key determinant of adherence to measures such as mask wearing, testing and social distancing. “People, even if they don’t feel personally at great risk, are doing it for ‘us’. And a sense of shared identity – of ‘us-ness’ – is a critical antecedent of trust,” he said.",News/World news,"First Covid wave raised UK adult risk of death by 40%, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/first-covid-wave-raised-uk-adult-risk-of-death-by-40-study-finds
1/7/2022,"The Home Office has been accused of failing to prioritise the most vulnerable people in Afghanistan after admitting that some of the first people to be accepted under a resettlement scheme are already living in the UK. The Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS), first announced in August to resettle up to 20,000 people over four years, was designed to offer sanctuary to “vulnerable people, including women and girls at risk, and members of minority groups at risk” after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban.  Victoria Atkins told the House of Commons on Thursday the scheme had now opened, with “the first to be resettled … already evacuated and in the UK”. “We are supporting those British nationals who have been assisted by the government to the UK, as well as their families, because we recognise that they experienced the same trauma and have the same needs as their Afghan neighbours fleeing Kabul alongside them,” she said. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, questioned why the government was counting UK nationals on a scheme meant to prioritise those trapped in Afghanistan. “Clearly British nationals and their families should get support, but why are they being counted in the resettlement scheme? “She [Atkins] will know there is huge concern about rumours that government departments have been trading people and trying to shunt people around in order to reduce the number of people who will be supported, and she will understand how deeply shameful that would be if it were true,” she said. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said he was “very concerned” that the government could be limiting the numbers given access to the scheme by including those already in the UK. “The announcement made today only goes as far as confirming that people in neighbouring countries will be able to access the scheme from the spring and that the pathway for people still in Afghanistan will be limited to a small cohort of people in the first year, leaving thousands of extremely vulnerable people in great danger,” he said. Ministers are also facing claims that women, girls, and religious and other minorities are no longer being prioritised after Atkins implied they would not be among the first tranche of evacuees admitted in to the UK. Atkins, the minister in charge of Afghan re-settlement, said two new safe routes to help Afghans escape to Britain were also due to be opened through the ACRS in coming months. The first will open “from the spring”, according to Atkins, and will involve the UN high commissioner for refugees recommending people in “need of resettlement” to the UK. The second new route, managed by the Foreign Office, will “work with international partners and NGOs” to expand it to others in need. Atkins said it would include “those who are particularly vulnerable, such as women and girls at risk and members of minority groups”. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat MP and the party’s former leader, said her words appeared to downgrade a promise to prioritise women and girls. “This represents a total betrayal of people in grave danger. The ministers responsible for this callous decision – which will cost lives – should hang their heads in shame,” he said. Zoe Gardner, policy manager at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said the scheme presented by Atkins was ill-defined. “Over almost six months, we’ve seen this government repeatedly kick the can down the road when it comes to resettlement, and abandon the Afghan people. Even now the confusion and lack of planning is clear,” she said. The ACRS was originally announced in August, when a statement from Boris Johnson and Priti Patel said: “Priority will be given to women and girls, and religious and other minorities, who are most at risk of human rights abuses and dehumanising treatment by the Taliban.” A Home Office spokesperson said it would be “completely wrong” to suggest that women, children and minorities would not be supported at every stage of the ACRS. “The government has already evacuated thousands of women and girls from Afghanistan – for example female judges, women’s rights activists and a girls football team. Women and girls are being immediately prioritised for resettlement through the ACRS. “As each ACRS pathway opens, those at most risk, including women and children and minorities will continue to be prioritised. The UNCHR will refer refugees most at risk to the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme, including women and girls as per their vulnerability criteria,” the spokesperson said.",News/Politics,Home Office ‘failing to prioritise most vulnerable Afghans’ in resettlement scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/06/home-office-failing-to-prioritise-most-vulnerable-afghans-in-resettlement-scheme
1/7/2022,"The acquittal of the Colston Four raises questions about new laws imposing 10-year jail terms for the toppling of statues, legal experts have said. On Wednesday, three men and a woman who helped pull down a monument to the slave trader Edward Colston at a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest were found not guilty by a jury on the grounds that they had a lawful excuse.  After the verdicts, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, was one of several MPs who condemned “destroying public property”. He said powers in the new police, crime, sentencing and courts bill would close a “potential loophole” that limits the prosecution of people who damage memorials. The bill, which is currently going through parliament, would let courts consider the “emotional or wider distress” and increase the maximum sentence to 10 years’ imprisonment regardless of the cost of damage. Some experts, however, said such prosecutions, when heard in front of jurors at crown court, could be destined to fail. Prof Tom Lewis, the director of the Centre for Rights and Justice at Nottingham Trent University, said the bill “will make the trial of those accused of damage to monuments possible only in the crown court, before a jury”. He said: “There is a certain irony in the fact that if the [Colston] defendants had been tried before a magistrate, they may well have been convicted. But in electing to trial by their peers – a right rooted in Magna Carta itself – they secured an acquittal.” The verdict in Bristol, where the statue had stood, sent a “powerful signal” to Boris Johnson and the home secretary, Priti Patel, who had condemned the toppling of Colston and were ushering through the bill, Lewis said. Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, said the verdict was a warning to ministers that the bill would lead to exactly the kinds of outcomes they did not want. “The current policing bill is criminalising peaceful protest,” he said. “What’s going to end up happening is that you are going to have more and more juries acquitting on the basis that they just don’t think it’s right to send someone to prison or give them a criminal record for peaceful protesting, and you’ll have more evidence in these trials of political motives.” But not all lawyers agreed. Zehrah Hasan, a barrister at Garden Court Law and a campaigner with the Black Protest Legal Support, said: “I don’t think we can use this victory as a way to say the courtroom and the law will always make it fair or lead to a just outcome … when obviously there is evidence of discrimination within the jury system, particularly against black and brown people.” At a press conference after the verdict, Raj Chada, who represented two of the Colston Four and has also acted for Extinction Rebellion activists, insisted the verdict did not set a precedent and did not mean people could take the law into their own hands. “[The defendants] had a number of defences, but broadly they have a lawful excuse as to why they committed the acts that they did,” Chada said. “Those valid excuses included their right to free speech, their right to conscience, and that a conviction would be disproportionate interference with those rights. And that they were preventing a crime – it was a criminal offence to keep that statue up because it was so offensive. It is really beyond belief it was up for so long.” The prime minister said people should not “go around seeking retrospectively to change our history”, adding: “It’s like some person trying to edit their Wikipedia entry - it’s wrong.” Robert Buckland, the Tory MP and former justice secretary, told the BBC he thought the jury’s decision was perverse. “I think anybody watching those scenes cannot fail to be disturbed at the very least, and appalled by what happened,” Buckland said. “I don’t think we want to see our crown courts becoming political playgrounds – they’re not places for politics, they’re places for the law to be applied and for the evidence to be assessed.” Jake Skuse, Rhian Graham, Milo Ponsford and Sage Willoughby were cleared after arguing their actions were justified by the offence caused by the presence of the statue in Bristol, the south-west’s most multicultural city.",News/Law,Colston Four acquittal raises doubts about 10-year jail term proposal,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/06/colston-four-acquittal-raises-doubts-about-10-year-jail-term-proposal
1/7/2022,"Robbie Dunne has seven days to appeal against a finding that he subjected his fellow rider Bryony Frost to a prolonged and deliberate campaign of bullying and harassment following the publication on Thursday of the three-person panel’s written reasons for their decision. Dunne was banned from riding for 18 months, with the final three months suspended, following a six-day hearing of the case by the British Horseracing Authority’s independent disciplinary panel in December, 14 months after Frost lodged a formal complaint with the regulator over her treatment by Dunne.  The hearing heard evidence that Frost had been subjected to physical, verbal and online bullying by Dunne, including deliberate intimidation during races and a “promise” by Dunne to Frost that “I am going to hurt you” after a race at Southwell in September 2020, which Frost understood to be a “genuine threat”. While the charges against Dunne related to events between February and September last year, Frost also told the panel that she remembered Dunne “opening his towel up and shaking himself in front of me” when she was an amateur in the early stages of her career. Her claim that Dunne had been abusive to other riders was supported by Hannah Welch, a former amateur jockey, who gave “compelling” and “entirely believable” evidence that he had reduced her to tears with verbal abuse after a race in November 2018. The panel’s written reasons make it clear that while its decision was made on the balance of probability, its members “were not troubled by any borderline decision on either guilt or sanction” and were satisfied that “this was deliberate, unwarranted targeting of a colleague over a considerable period of time. “The matters proved were consecutive, occurred over six months, as time went by deepening in spitefulness, and consequently the words and acts achieving the increasingly chilling effect upon the victim which Mr Dunne intended”. Frost, the panel felt, was a “truthful, careful and compelling witness” whose “account of her treatment … was clear, consistent, credible and unshaken by cross examination.” Dunne, by contrast, was found to be “an unreliable witness”, and “the sweep of his denials, criticisms and reasoning meant that his evidence was unbalanced and at times, difficult to follow.” The panel also rejected Dunne’s “specific criticism of Ms Frost’s riding”, adding that “even if there was force in that criticism this would not justify his conduct in any of the incidents we considered”. The panel also highlights the extent to which its members believed other jockeys and weighing room staff allowed Dunne’s actions to go unchallenged. “We reminded ourselves, in his favour,” it says, “that some at least of the facts found involved Mr Dunne operating within a culture approbated by his peers. Observers observed without intervention. If this is the weighing room culture, then it is out of step in equal opportunity race-riding.” In particular, the panel highlights evidence given by Frost and Dunne’s fellow riders concerning incidents of verbal abuse at Stratford and Southwell in July and September 2021 respectively. At Stratford, the panel heard what it described as “compelling evidence” from a fence attendant that Dunne had unleashed a “barrage” of abuse at Frost shortly after a race, and that he was “shocked at the nature and ferocity” of the insults used. However, the riders Adam Wedge and Lorcan Murtagh, who were closer to the incident than the witness, said in statements to the hearing that they had heard “nothing out of the ordinary”. Lingfield Park: 12.35 Smith (nb), 1.05 He’s Our Star, 1.40 Surrey Territories, 2.15 Marnie James, 2.50 Azaheer, 3.20 No Flies On Me, 3.50 Parikarma Wetherby: 12.50 Stand Staunch, 1.25 Readysteadybeau, 2.00 Grand Turina, 2.35 Global Agreement, 3.05 Relkadam, 3.35 Bolton   Wolverhampton: 4.00 Inevitable Outcome, 4.30 Quick Change, 5.00 Impulsive One, 5.30 Glen Rosa, 6.00 Fitwood Star, 6.30 Street Kid (nap), 7.00 Thapa Vc Similar statements from riders including Tom Scudamore, who suggested that a confrontation at Southwell in which Dunne threatened to “put [Frost] through a wing [of a fence]” was “no different from what he would see or hear every third day” were also addressed. “None regarded the altercation as other than the traditional workings of the weighing room,” the panel say. “The evidence that other senior jockeys of standing heard nothing over and above a regular spat … concerned us.” In a postscript to its finding, the panel says that it “had to consider the culture, as it was often described, amongst the community of professional jockeys or in the weighing room”. It concludes: “As these reasons show, we had some concerns about it.. Our role was to inquire into the conduct of Mr Dunne. It is for others to reflect upon more general matters. We confine ourselves to recording our concern arising out of the specific facts of this particular case.”",Sport/Sport,Dunne given appeal deadline as written reasons in Frost case revealed,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/06/dunne-given-appeal-deadline-as-written-reasons-in-frost-case-revealed
