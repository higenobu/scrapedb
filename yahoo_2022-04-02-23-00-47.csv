4/2/2022,"Since the start of the Ukraine War, a barrage of western sanctions has crippled the Russian economy and wreaked havoc on its financial system. The country has been largely cut off from the international payment system SWIFT, seen its access to $630 billion in foreign exchange reserves restricted, and watched as more than $17 billion in assets were seized from Russian oligarchs. But for the past eight years, Russia has been preparing for the worst. In June of 2014, just three months after its invasion of the Crimean Peninsula, the country established its own payment system to help process credit card transactions domestically. Russia’s National Payment Card System—known to Russians as NSPK—has continued to process credit card transactions during the latest fighting in Ukraine. Even though Mastercard, Visa, American Express, PayPal, and Discover have all suspended their operations in Russia, its citizens aren’t experiencing the type of disruption many might expect. Mastercard told Fortune via email that credit cards issued by Russian banks are no longer supported by its network. Instead, credit cards being used in Russia are now processed over something called a “switch,” run by the Central Bank of Russia. Dr. Leo Lipis, the CEO of the payments industry consulting firm Lipis Advisors, said that a switch is “a hub for communication that connects the various banks involved in a payments network.” This means Russian consumers relying on locally-issued cards bearing the Mastercard logo can still use their cards like they normally would, Lipis noted. A spokesperson for Mastercard confirmed in a separate email to Fortune that the company doesn’t have the ability to block domestic transactions in Russia, but it receives “no benefit” from them. This is because Mastercard, along with other Western companies, signed an agreement for their transactions to be processed by NSPK in 2015. Russians are still blocked from using Western credit cards outside of the country, but that’s only helped the Kremlin’s goal of keeping assets from moving abroad. The sanctions also boosted Russia’s own credit card company, MIR, which is built on the back of NSPK and owned by the Central Bank of Russia. When MIR debuted in late 2015, Russians were slow to adopt the card. Then, the government mandated that public sector employees receiving state funds and welfare benefits use MIR payment cards, spawning new growth for the firm. “When you go back to 2015, Visa and MasterCard pretty much shared the Russian market 50-50,” Lipis said. “And by the time you get to 2020, the market is shared three ways.” Today, there are more than 100 million MIR cards issued, according to the company. And with U.S. card companies leaving Russia, MIR can more easily grow its market share. In recent years, other countries, including Turkey, India, and China, have also developed their own payment systems to limit the influence of U.S. credit card companies and limit the pain caused by any sanctions. After the recent invasion, Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, turned to China’s Union Pay and the so-called Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) in an effort to circumvent Western sanctions and issue new cards. Union Pay has agreements with many European and U.S. credit card networks that allow foreign cards to be processed through its payment system and accepted in some Western countries, particularly in tourist destinations, Lipis said. The payment systems expert noted that China’s Union Pay could be opening itself up to “secondary sanctions” from the West if it knowingly helps Russian banks circumvent sanctions. Still, when it comes to processing transactions abroad, Russia’s MIR and the Chinese payment systems aren’t “adequate substitutes” for U.S.-based payment systems like Visa and Mastercard, Lipis said. And they carry less than 0.5% of the total value of payments made via SWIFT. “There is some truth to the Visa slogan of it's everywhere you want to be,” he added.

4/2/2022,"Charles Schwab will be launching its own direct indexing solution, one of—if not the—first designed for a broader audience beyond high net worth individuals and institutions. The Schwab Personalized Indexing business should be operational by the end of April, and will be aimed at financial advisors and retail investors, the firm said in a press release. As part of being designed for a broader audience, the account minimum for the services is $100,000, with the press release noting that most direct indexing offerings require at least $250,000. The pricing starts at 0.40%, which is significantly higher than the 0.03% charged by the broad-market Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI). However, VTI is about as plain vanilla as an investor can get and, of course, comes with no tax management or customization capabilities on its own. Forty basis points is a midrange cost for an ETF, and while expensive for a plain vanilla fund, perfectly reasonable for a smart beta strategy or even a thematic fund. “[Thanks] to technology innovations and industry developments like Schwab’s introduction of online commission-free trading, we’re able to lower the barriers to direct indexing for more investors and the advisors who serve them,” said Charles Schwab Corp. President Rick Wurster. Direct indexing has drawn attention due to its customization capabilities and the potential tax management benefits it can offer. And as technology has improved, it has been possible to offer it at lower and lower price points. “Personalized indexing will increasingly define what investors want. Our research shows one-third of our clients are interested in direct indexing,” said Schwab Product Management Director Divya Krishnan. With a direct indexing portfolio, the client owns the individual securities in their personalized index rather than a mutual fund or ETF. The Schwab model takes advantage of the firm’s commission-free online trading and its in-house optimization process that incorporates daily monitoring and tax-loss harvesting technology under the direction of a team of investment professionals. The customized strategies will be delivered to clients via separately managed accounts, according to the press release. The process used by Schwab Personalized Indexing will optimize a client’s portfolio by considering such factors as their current holdings and unrealized tax profile, as well as taxes, risks and tracking error. Clients can choose from three base indexes that can be customized to their needs: the Schwab 1000 Index, which is very similar to the Russell 1000 Index; the S&P SmallCap 600 Index; and the MSCI KLD 400 Social Index, one of the original ESG benchmarks, the press release says. The firm says it will add additional features and strategies during the next 12-18 months.
