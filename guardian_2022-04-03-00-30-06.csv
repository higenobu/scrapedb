4/3/2022,"County cricket is no stranger to rumours of its imminent reorganisation. There lives in every top honcho a desire to tinker with the settings, like a 1970s teenager idly flicking from turgid western to Songs of Praise on a Sunday afternoon. Sometimes these changes are genuinely huge – the switch to two divisions in 2000, the expansion from nine counties to 14 in 1895, the admission of Durham in 1998, the switch to four-day cricket in 1993; sometimes less so, like the move to 10 teams in the first division, eight in the second, which comes into place on Thursday with the start of the season. And to accompany that – travelling in the well-marked footsteps of Bob Willis, Michael Parkinson and Michael Atherton’s Cricket reform group, and ECB’s own 2007 Schofield report, among others – comes yet another review. This one is commissioned by the interim ECB director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, whose attitude to the 18-team championship falls somewhere between fond frustration and amused antipathy. Strauss, who hopes the review, authorised after England’s disastrous Ashes tour, will be “bold and ambitious” has stressed that it is a high-performance system review, not a domestic structure review, but it is hard to see how you can do one without the other. The report aims to conclude by the end of September this year, with any changes in place for the start of the 2023 season. “Bold” is a word to cause prickling anxiety among many four-day cricket supporters who are only just being handed back their two-divisional Championship, after the Covid years of the regional Bob Willis Trophy. The Hundred has already introduced eight city-based teams – two in London, and one each in Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Southampton, Cardiff and Nottingham – to perch on top of the county structure, and there are fears that something similar will be introduced in the county game. There have been reports that a 12-team premier league playing each other once is being considered, with a six-team second division playing each other twice. Both would retain first-class status, but those counties kicking about at the bottom would have justifiable fears for their financial survival. Other potential reforms include moving the championship to a more central period of the season, this has happened to some extent for 2022, and finding ways to produce better pitches and develop more spin bowlers (Sophie Ecclestone surely the go-to person here). One thing those in charge must remember is that the championship is being judged on the players it has nurtured over the past two extraordinary years. The truncated 2020 season, held entirely behind closed doors, was played for the Bob Willis Trophy, and won by Essex in a humdinger of a match at Lord’s against Somerset. The championship was revived in 2021 but in a complicated conference system, with Warwickshire crowned champions, in a race that went down to the last day. They also went on to beat Lancashire in a colder, more one-sided, “Bob” going into October. The 2022 season starts with teams divided into divisions as decided at the end of the 2019 season – which is bad luck for Nottinghamshire, who last summer finally played up to their billing, finishing third in the championship after a drought of nearly three years without a red-ball win. The spotlight, however, will be on Yorkshire, who spent the winter being rocked by succeeding tumultuous waves following Azeem Rafiq’s moving account, in front of the Parliamentary DCMS select committee, of the racism he encountered in the club. A mass cull of the coaching and medical staff – some of whom were not even there when Rafiq was at the club – has left a feeling of residual bitterness among some at Headingley – and the club is facing a number of employment tribunals. However, the EGM held on Thursday, which ratified the structural changes required before the ECB lifted the ban on the club holding international cricket, seems to have drawn a line in the sand. The new chairman, Kamlesh Patel, managing director of cricket Darren Gough and head coach Ottis Gibson, are determined to push the club forward into a new era. “It’s sad what’s happened, we can never take it back, we can’t forget what’s happened, it’s about learning from it, moving forward and make sure that situation doesn’t happen again,” said Gough at a cold Headingley on Friday morning. “We want to be on the front and back pages for the right reasons.” Yorkshire avoid the first round – due to the relaying of the Headingley outfield over the winter – and are still waiting to hear if they will be docked points by the ongoing ECB independent investigation panel. Elsewhere, there are plenty of players with something to prove. Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson may have a trick or two up their sleeve, as well as a barbed word, while there will be plenty of opportunity for England’s recent batting rejects, Haseeb Hameed, Rory Burns, Dawid Malan, and those who didn’t cover themselves in glory in the Caribbean – the Dukes ball in April notwithstanding. Lancashire fans will be looking forward to another of perennial England drinks carrier Matt Parkinson’s balls of the century – though sadly Shane Warne is no longer here to appreciate and retweet it – and Glamorgan, the return of the world’s best batsman, Marnus Labuschagne. In fact there is a thrilling hand of overseas players to watch including Simon Harmer, at last returned to South Africa’s international embrace, Kyle Abbott, Mohammad Abbas, Jackson Bird, Hassan Ali, Peter Siddle, Hashim Amla, Kemar Roach and Haris Rauf with Mohammad Rizwan coming up against Shaheen Shah Afridi when Sussex play Middlesex in early May at Hove. Not forgetting the greatest Championship stalwart of them all, Darren Stevens, he of Australian WhatsApp group “Stevo’s gonna get ya” fame. Stevens, soon to be 46, signed a new one-year contract at the end of last season. Who would dare bet against him signing another.",Sport/Sport,‘Bold and ambitious’ – hopes are high for County Championship revamp,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/02/bold-and-ambitious-hopes-are-high-for-county-championship-revamp
4/3/2022,"Unionised workers are increasingly prepared to challenge inadequate pay offers and take strike action to ensure wages keep up with the sharply rising cost of living, amid signs that workplace militancy is growing in parts of the economy. Some of the UK’s biggest unions are battling scores of firms at the same time, with the number of industrial disputes well above pre-pandemic levels. GMB members entered into dispute with 42 employers between October 2021 and March 2022 – seven times the number of disputes in the same period in 2019-20. Unite members are currently involved in 30 disputes in England – almost four times the reported number involving the union three years ago. Over the past 12 months, the Trades Union Congress has logged at least 300 disputes in different industries, indicating that more and more workers are challenging below-inflation pay offers after a decade of wage stagnation following the 2008 banking crash. Organised workers in some sectors are racking up sizeable wins, despite inflation shrinking pay packets overall. The GMB recorded six such victories over the past five months, including outsourced bin workers in Eastbourne and Hastings securing 19%-plus rises. Unite has secured 35 wins in recent months, including warehouse workers at B&Q’s national distribution centre in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, operated by the logistics firm Wincanton, who gained a near-11% pay boost after taking strike action. There is a growing willingness to threaten or use strikes to force companies to match soaring price inflation, which the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated last week would cause the fastest fall in living standards since modern records began in the 1950s. Workers in Unite are currently involved in eight strikes, including a bitter dispute between refuse drivers and Labour-controlled Coventry council, which could lead to Unite cutting funding for the Labour party. The GMB is organising 10 strikes and holding two ballots. Workers at the Fox’s Glacier Mints factory in York walked out last week over a below-inflation pay offer while staff at the pharmaceutical firm GSK and gas company Cadent are balloting for strikes. The TUC said there was more industrial conflict than at any time over the past five years. “Workers are on the front foot and taking employers on,” said Kevin Rowan, the TUC’s head of organisation. Even though the most recent ONS briefing suggests days lost to strikes remain low in historic terms, there has been an upturn in disputes not captured by the official data, which only covers strikes and lags at least a year behind. “By any measure, we are seeing a significant rise in disputes – albeit from a low base,” said Rowan. These disputes are often localised as employment laws have made it harder to take national industrial action. Unison recently failed to meet the new 50% turnout threshold in a strike ballot of council workers. But it is far from impossible: thousands of university staff have 15 days of strikes this year in a row over pension cuts as well as real-term pay cuts and precarious contracts. There is also the prospect of a national dispute over the railways, where large-scale redundancies are looming. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has called for restraint in wage increases to help prevent an inflationary spiral. But Rowan said improved pay awards were not pushing up inflation. “Energy and food costs are the real drivers of inflation rather than wages,” he said. “Wages have been held back for a very long time and lots of people are really struggling. Workers should not be paying the price for economic factors out of their control.”",News/UK news,Strikes in UK at highest in five years as pay is hit by inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/02/strikes-in-uk-at-highest-in-five-years-as-pay-is-hit-by-inflation
4/3/2022,"While the UK, US and much of the EU are gripped by a cost-of-living crisis heightened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in France, President Emmanuel Macron’s “tariff shield” is helping keep a lid on rising prices. Inflation there hit 4.5% in March, and while this was up from February’s 3.6%, it remains one of the lowest rates in the industrialised west and well below the UK’s 6.2%, Germany’s 7.3%, Spain’s 9.8% and 11.9% in the Netherlands. A decision last year to limit the amount by which France’s largely state-owned energy companies could raise prices has benefited consumers and taken some of the inflationary pressure off industries that depend on gas and electricity. In France, where about two-thirds of power comes from Électricité de France’s nuclear plants, the electricity component of inflation has risen by 4% in the past 12 months, but by an average of more than 27% in the eurozone generally. Yet, in the first round of the presidential election next Sunday, Macron will face criticism from left and right for rocketing diesel prices, which hit the rural poor, and for his attempts over the previous five years to end decades of low growth with a string of pro-business policies. Recent outrage over his €2.4bn spending on consultants since coming to office, including €1bn with McKinsey of the US, is another headline-grabbing issue drowning out his impressive economic record and denting his lead in the polls. By most economic yardsticks – national income, business investment, consumer spending, labour supply and rising prices – France sits at or near the top of the pile of rich nations. Contrary to most forecasts, its economy recovered last year to 1% above pre-pandemic levels. The UK is still 0.1% below. Business investment is up in France but down in the UK. Labour shortages there are restricted to discrete corners of the economy, thanks to the expansion of a German-style apprenticeship scheme that the British government promised, but has yet to deliver. UBS economist Felix Huefner said: “The exceptional performance of the labour market has been a huge surprise.” More people are working in France than before the pandemic, whereas in the UK, about 500,000 people, mostly over- 50s, have quit the labour market, making shortages more acute. Daniela Ordonez at Oxford Economics credits better-funded and targeted financial support: “It meant French people continued buying big-ticket items when other countries stopped.” The performance gap may appear small – the number of people working or seeking work is 1% higher in France than in 2019 (and 1.5% lower in the UK). But Huefner says an increase in worker numbers through the pandemic helped keep French wages in check – and business costs down. Philippe Aghion of Insead business school in Fontainebleau says 1.2m jobs were created between 2017 and 2021, “and not just any jobs – the proportion of long-term, long-tenure jobs has increased.” Temporary contracts, especially for younger workers, were common after almost two decades of restrictive employment laws – not least the 35-hour week, which dates from February 2000. Temp agency workers, contractors and interns became as common in France as in the UK, as firms tried to sidestep the costs of permanent employment. Aghion was one of Macron’s three economic advisers when he first ran for the presidency. He says the president’s cap on employment tribunal costs was a game-changer, giving big companies an incentive to hire more full-time workers. Reforms of apprenticeships and training were another seismic boost, he says: “In France, we used to be very top-down, but these days we are more bottom-up, allowing workers to negotiate solutions with firms. Training is no longer decided by unions; workers choose what to do, as they do in Germany.” Speaking to the Observer last week, Cédric O, France’s secretary of state for the digital economy and a close Macron ally, said the president’s reforms of tax and employment laws, and his understanding of the concerns of small firms, played an important part: “He understands and believes in entrepreneurs. Now we’re halfway to creating the business ecosystem we need.” Ordonez worries that much of the money Macron spent during the pandemic has pushed the national debt from below 100% to 115% of national income in two years. At the beginning of this year, Bank of France governor François Villeroy de Galhau warned election candidates that proposals for tax cuts and new spending were unaffordable: “We cannot allow our public finances to deteriorate further.” Macron has already committed more than €60bn to a recovery fund, alongside €40bn from the EU, to provide the backbone of public investment over the next two years. But Ordonez is among many who argue that, so far, Macron’s government has distributed borrowed funds wisely. “The money is being spent to restructure the economy and liberate companies from historically high taxes,” she says. “Higher investment and job creation will pay dividends.”",News/Business,"Lower inflation, better jobs … in France la vie est belle",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/02/lower-inflation-better-jobs-in-france-la-vie-est-belle
4/3/2022,"Standing before tens of thousands of supporters, waving flags bearing his party’s red and green logo, Imran Khan railed against the “foreign conspiracy” to dislodge his government. Supporters had travelled from across the country for the rally last weekend, pouring into the capital, Islamabad, in cars and buses to express their support as Khan fights for his political life. “Funding is being channelled into Pakistan from abroad in an attempt to change the government,” he told the cheering crowd. “Our own people are being used.” On Thursday, he reiterated the claim of foreign interference in a live televised address, stating: “America threatened me.” (The US government denies any involvement). But for all this bluster, Khan’s problems are closer to home. “We’ve seen months of political instability, political recriminations and economic mismanagement,” says Farzana Shaikh, an associate fellow at Chatham House. “Things had to come to a head.” When Khan became Pakistan’s prime minister in 2018, he promised to disrupt dynastic politics, end corruption and revitalise the economy. Four years later, he has failed to deliver. After a wave of defections from his parliamentary coalition and his own party – and the loss of all-important military support – he is expected to lose a parliamentary vote of no confidenceon Sunday. The crisis comes 30 years after Khan led Pakistan’s cricket team to an unlikely victory in the 1992 World Cup. Ahead of the final match against England that year, he famously told his team to “fight like cornered tigers” in a rousing speech that has gone down in sporting history. It is an apt metaphor for Khan’s current approach, as he refuses to step down in the face of mounting pressure. Khan has a wafer-thin majority in Pakistan’s National Assembly; his Pakistan-e-Tehreek Insaaf (PTI) party and its coalition partners had 176 seats in the 342-member assembly. On Wednesday, a key partner, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM-P) said its seven parliamentarians would vote with the opposition, bolstering its combined 163 seats. Twelve PTI lawmakers also indicated they would cross the floor, which would make it numerically impossible for Khan to win. The government has approached the country’s supreme court to attempt to invalidate the defectors’ votes, a move which could delay the no-confidence motion. In the last week, Khan has called several large rallies of PTI supporters and branded opposition MPs “traitors”. This is in keeping with his brand of aggressively populist, nationalist politics. Many of those who backed him in 2018 were young, urban, middle-class voters – a broadly conservative demographic in Pakistan – who were tired of endemic corruption and the stranglehold of dynastic politics. But despite a series of eye-catching promises – such as a pledge to end major corruption in 90 days and to create 10 million jobs – Khan has failed to deliver. With Pakistan’s economy mired in a debt crisis, inflation soaring to double digits and the rupee plunging in value against the dollar, he has struggled to maintain widespread public support. These problems are not entirely of his own making; global issues, such as rising energy costs and pandemic-related supply-chain problems, have played a part. But Khan’s handling of economic policy has been shambolic; he changed his economic team several times in a short period of time, and delayed seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. That $6bn bailout, agreed last year, has brought painful economic reforms that have further increased fuel and electricity prices. Throughout his 26 years in politics, Khan has shown himself willing to shapeshift in pursuit of power. Despite his international image as a playboy and socialite, he embraced conservative Islam, earning him the local nickname “Taliban Khan” in reference to his overtures to religious hardliners. In the 2013 election campaign, when Khan really began to gather mass support, he presented himself as an anti-corruption crusader – but in 2018, he gained important political backing from established, highly corrupt feudal politicians. In opposition, he railed against the outsized role of the military in public life, saying the generals “just don’t have the vision to run the country”. But his rise to political power in 2018 was widely attributed to military patronage. “Khan made a big deal out of being the outsider but his close relationship with the military establishment put a different gloss on his populism,” says Shaikh. Pakistan has been directly ruled by the military for roughly half of its 75 years, and Khan’s victory in 2018 was only the second transition from one democratically elected government to another. But that victory came amid drastically ramped-up censorship, with widespread allegations of military interference in favour of the PTI. During the election campaign, three news channels were taken off air by the regulator after broadcasting speeches by major opposition parties, while PTI rallies aired without problems. Every opposition party initially rejected his win, alleging vote-rigging. Once he was in power, Khan did nothing to build bridges, instead jailing prominent opposition politicians – including his two predecessors, Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari – on corruption charges. Khan has since presided over further crackdowns on free speech and political opposition. During his tenure, scores of journalists, activists and protesters, including a sitting member of parliament, have been arrested for sedition or under counterterrorism laws. At rallies, Khan refers to the three main opposition parties as “the three stooges” or “three mice”. For most of Pakistan’s history, the two dynastic parties, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N), have been at loggerheads, but now they have formed an unlikely alliance, along with the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), to oust Khan. An important factor in Khan’s troubles is the apparent loss of military support, a dramatic change in political dynamics which has emboldened the opposition to strike now. Even when it is not in direct control of Pakistan, the army pulls strings behind the scenes, particularly on foreign policy and domestic security. “The military role was much more explicit and open than for any previous government,” says Shaikh. “Khan saw it as a source of strength, rather than weakness, and flaunted it.” The relationship with the military began to sour in October when Khan resisted the army’s choice for a new head of the intelligence service. It is extremely unusual for a civilian politician to push back on army appointments. The generals prevailed but concerns remained that Khan might try to place a loyal aide in charge of the army when the chief role comes up for renewal this year. “He is arrogant,” says Zia Ur Rehman, a Karachi-based journalist and researcher. “He tried to be something different than previous prime ministers, but this was a huge misjudgement.” In the febrile world of Pakistani politics, no prime minister has ever completed a full term. Even if Khan is ousted, it is unlikely that it will spell the end of his political career. Ever since he founded the PTI in 1996, Khan has been a campaigning politician. He seems most comfortable in front of a crowd of rapturous supporters rather than doing the more mundane and methodical work of government. “Khan has continued to act like an opposition leader despite being prime minister – using rallies to criticise the opposition and even to relay messages to foreign powers,” says Ur Rehman. “His removal will give him a new political life.” When the confidence motion was called, Khan’s information minister, Fawad Chaudry, warned that “one million” PTI supporters would come to Islamabad on the day of the vote, and that anyone voting against Khan would “have to pass through these people on their way in and out of parliament”. This thinly veiled threat is ominous in the context of Pakistan, where political differences often erupt into violence. Human Rights Watch called on the government to “uphold the constitution and allow for voting without threats or violence”. It may be a sign of things to come as the PTI loses its grip on power. Even as he has lost mass public support, Khan has had no problems calling huge rallies across Pakistan. “His deeply reactionary politics resonates across swathes of the country,” says Shaikh. “This brand of politics will outlive him. That will be his legacy.” Samira Shackle is the author of Karachi Vice: Life and Death in a Contested City (Granta)",News/World news,‘Cornered tiger’ Imran Khan makes last-ditch bid to cling to political power,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/cornered-tiger-imran-khan-makes-last-ditch-bid-to-cling-to-political-power
4/3/2022,"Inflation is weighing on Nazia Rehman’s mind. Not only has the Wigan councillor been approached by scores of residents who can’t afford their energy bills, but some of the town’s community centres – tasked with helping the very same people – now face similar problems. “They’re saying they’re not sustainable any more because of the risk they can’t afford their expenses,” she says. “They’re our eyes and ears: people use them and they’re so valued by our community. It would be a disaster if they go.” As the councillor responsible for finance and resources in the Greater Manchester town of 320,000, she has seen first-hand how demand for services is ballooning just as the price of providing them is escalating dramatically thanks to the cost-of-living crisis. Wigan council has seen its own energy costs increase by about 115%, making it expensive to keep open buildings that homeless and elderly people, and many families, rely on – just when levels of poverty are expected to rise sharply. “As an organisation we face a huge risk,” she says. “And it’s not just financial; it’s human now, because people depend on us.” Rehman’s worries are a taste of the inflationary pain ripping through local authority budgets. Councils across Britain are facing growing challenges as the cost-of-living crisis sweeps the country. The highest rates of inflation for at least three decades are driving a sharp rise in the cost of the raw materials, labour and services they have to buy to provide public services. In addition to the hit on energy costs, Rehman says contractors working on its building projects have requested an extra £1m on one scheme and a further £600,000 on another as the price of materials spirals. It doesn’t help that the council’s finances are already at breaking point after a decade of cuts left the town among the hardest-hit by austerity: £160m has been sliced from its budget since 2010. “It’s austerity by stealth,” she says. “We’re in a crisis. But after a decade of cuts, then the pandemic and the unfolding crisis in Ukraine, it’s really, really challenging for us to respond.” Government figures show councils and the public sector collectively buy more than £290bn of materials and services – from road grit to school meals – from private firms, and spend billions of pounds more on staff wages and energy bills for council buildings. The Institute for Government says local authorities are on course to be between £800,000 and £2bn out of pocket as a result of inflation that’s higher than was expected when chancellor Rishi Sunak set out funding limits in his autumn spending review. Even before taking account of inflation, the Local Government Association estimates the allocation from Westminster is at least £1bn short of requirements, as councils face growing pressures from an ageing population and an economy still grappling with Covid. Then there are wages. With inflation forecast to peak close to 9% later this year, driven by soaring global energy prices after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, pay disputes are bubbling to the surface as wages fail to keep pace. Councils and the wider public sector are suffering the biggest real-terms cuts. Refuse collectors have gone on strike in Coventry, Glasgow and Brighton, and unions say civil servants could take industrial action after the government announced a 3% cap on pay last week. Despite the pressures, Sunak has suggested efficiency gains should be sought to fund any additional public spending pressures. He believes expansive budgets are already in place for the public sector, while tax cuts should now be prioritised over further growth in state spending. To hammer home the point, ministers last week launched a new cabinet committee on efficiency and value for money, saying £5.5bn of savings could be targeted, with the money then pumped back into public services. But with town halls already stretched by a decade of austerity, this could undermine Boris Johnson’s promise to “level up” the country. This is risky for the Tories with local elections due next month. In Warrington, Cathy Mitchell, deputy leader of the Labour-run council, says there are few efficiency savings to be found after a decade of cuts. With its own network of buses to run, the council has been hit by higher fuel costs after diesel prices reached a record high, and competition from the private sector on pay means it is struggling to retain drivers. “The low-hanging fruit went years ago. We started with austerity in 2010, so 12 years in is a bit cheap to say ‘Let’s find efficiencies.’ We’ve lost a fifth of staff since austerity started. The people left behind are doing a lot more with a lot less,” she says. A government spokesperson said support with living costs was being made available for families across the country. Councils in England will also have access to £54.1bn in grant funding, an increase of 3.7bn on a year earlier, “in recognition of their vital role in providing essential services and supporting some of the most vulnerable people in our communities”. In Birmingham, council leader Ian Ward has been convening local charities to discuss a coordinated response to the soaring cost of living. As Europe’s biggest local authority, with a budget of more than £3bn a year – and spending worth more than £200m to host this year’s Commonwealth Games in the city – the council is all too aware of inflation denting its finances. “I am worried about the impact it’s going to have on families across Birmingham, and the charities are in similar position,” says the Labour councillor. “They’re at the sharp end of this. As demand goes up, they’re going to struggle to meet that, and they’ll need more funding. It’s a pressure at both ends.” The council set its budget assuming inflation would be 2% this year, with 2.5% wage growth. “Now we know inflation is going to be running at a lot higher than that, and that will no doubt feed into wage demands as well,” he says, adding that the government needs to recognise this issue and increase funding for councils. “It’s not just rising cost; it’s the rising demand for services as more and more people are tipped into difficulty.” There are ways councils can offset the squeeze. They have more financial muscle in negotiations with suppliers and can achieve economies of scale unavailable to households, and this meaning they could face lower rates of inflation than consumers. Many, including Birmingham’s, agreed fixed 12-month contracts with energy suppliers before prices rocketed. Others aren’t as fortunate. Several local authorities are exploring ways to get out of contracts with Gazprom, the Russian state-owned energy giant, after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Public sector bodies are estimated to have bought about £106m of energy from Gazprom since 2016, according to data provider Tussel. Ripping up contracts is unlikely to come without cost. In Portsmouth, the council expects to face early-exit charges of more than £100,000, while the recent sharp rise in global energy prices means replacing its existing deal could cost more than £300,000. Slough borough council has predicted that its energy costs could rise by more than £3m by 2025 as gas prices soar, while three Scottish councils on Tayside are likely to see bills rise by £7m this year. Andrew Burns of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, which represents public accounting professionals, says the cocktail of risks facing councils comes just as calls on their services rise. “A pound is buying less, yet demand is increasing. I hate to use the phrase, but it’s a perfect storm of uncertainty and financial challenges all going in the wrong direction.”",News/Business,Rising prices and wages land councils with their own cost-of-living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/02/rising-prices-and-wages-land-councils-with-their-own-cost-of-living-crisis

4/3/2022,"One of the Duke of York’s senior aides told bankers that a now disputed cash payment to the prince was for his daughter Princess Beatrice’s wedding, it has been reported. In 2019, Andrew received £750,000 from Nebahat Isbilen, a Turkish millionaire and wife of a former leading politician, who has claimed in the high court that she was told by her financial adviser Selman Turk to pay the sum to the prince in return for assistance with a passport application. It was later claimed in court documents that this was a false representation. Isbilen is now suing Turk in the high court, alleging that he defrauded her. Andrew offered no explanation on Friday as to why the money originally entered his bank account and why he paid it back in full after being approached by Isbilen’s lawyers 16 months after it was received. The Daily Mail has obtained a transcript of a phone call on 14 November 2019 between Andrew’s former aide Amanda Thirsk and bankers acting for Isbilen. In the call, the bankers queried the purpose of the £750,000 transfer from Isbilen’s account to the duke’s personal account at Coutts, and Thirsk, who was a senior member of the royal household at the time but no longer works there, said: “It’s a gift for the wedding, a wedding gift.” Responding to the latest reports, a spokesperson for Andrew said they could not comment while legal proceedings were ongoing. Isbilen had claimed that she had been told by Turk that the payment was for the prince’s assistance with a passport application, although it was later claimed this was a false representation. An affidavit by Isbilen that has been seen by the Guardian states that she later saw an email from Turk to her bank claiming the transfer was a “wedding gift to Princess Beatrice owing to the close connection between our families”. She adds: “This email is entirely false.” Beatrice married Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a private ceremony in Windsor in July 2020. Turk was the founder and chief executive of Heyman AI, a digital challenger bank which, nine days before the £750k payment was made, received an award in person from Andrew at a Pitch@Palace event – a Dragons’ Den-style project for entrepreneurs created by the prince. On Friday it emerged that Beatrice’s mother and Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, also received payments of at least £225,000 from Turk via Alphabet Capital, said to be in connection with payment she was owed for her work with a solar power company. Ferguson’s spokesperson said: “The duchess was completely unaware of the allegations that have since emerged against Mr Turk. She is naturally concerned by what has been alleged against him.” A spokesperson for Andrew said: “We are unable to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.” The Guardian has approached Turk for comment. The reports come after the prince settled a sexual assault case filed against him by Virginia Giuffre for an undisclosed sum, reported to be as much as £12m. The out-of-court settlement in the US civil case meant the prince made no admission of guilt over claims by Giuffre that he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17, allegations he has repeatedly denied. On Tuesday, Andrew made his first public appearance since the settlement, alongside his mother, the Queen, at a memorial service for his father, Prince Philip.",News/UK news,Prince Andrew aide ‘said disputed £750k payment was for daughter’s wedding’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/02/prince-andrew-aide-payment-high-court-case
