5/13/2022,"A Chinese genius flexed his mathematical prowess by solving a problem that flummoxed a team of mathematicians with Ph.D.s for four months in a single night.

Wei Dongyi, a 30-year-old assistant mathematics professor at Peking University in Beijing, came to the rescue after six mathematicians called him for help as they tried building a complex mathematics model. After using the equations he provided to alter their experiment, the team’s model obtained a passing rate of over 96%.

The mathematicians wanted to pay the professor to show their gratitude, but he declined.

""It’s unnecessary to pay me for such an easy problem,"" he said.

Wei, who became known as “God Wei,” eventually asked for a recharge of his transport card as a form of compensation.

“It is not rare or surprising to us that Wei can solve the puzzle that other people cannot because he is smart and is hyper-focused on math problems,” Chen Dayue, the dean of Peking University’s School of Mathematical Sciences, told Chinese news platform Jiupai News.

Wei was reportedly accepted to Peking University without taking the gaokao, China’s national college entrance exam, due to his math skills and past achievements, including his two consecutive victories at the International Mathematical Olympiad while he was still a high school student.

He also turned down an offer from Harvard, which went so far as to offer an English language waiver and an interpreter so that he could study there as a Ph.D. candidate, his former teacher Zhang Yonghua told Shandong Business News.

Wei’s Peking University faculty profile states that he received his B.S. in Mathematics at the university in 2014 and earned his Ph.D. in the same field four years later.

The professor found himself in the spotlight last year after an awkward interview clip of him went viral. He was mistaken for a student due to his disheveled appearance, simple clothes and giant plastic water bottle.

“He is a disciplined person. We often saw him eat steamed buns accompanied with tofu in the canteen,” one of Wei’s former classmates told City Express. “He studied well and he won scholarships of over 100,000 yuan (US$15,655) a year. But he still lives a plain life, being rustic in both clothing and food.”

5/13/2022,"Three in 10 Asian Americans have modified their daily routines over fears of threats and attacks, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.

Polling 365 Asians — from a larger sample of 10,156 U.S. adults — between April 12 and April 18, the survey found that 36% have made such changes in the past 12 months, convinced that they might be targeted because of their race or ethnicity.

The survey also found that 63% felt violence against Asian Americans is increasing, while 19% said it’s the same and 8% thought it’s decreasing. This trend appears to be an improvement from last year’s results, where 81% felt the violence was increasing.

Some 7% said they worry daily about threats and attacks. Another 14% said they worry almost daily, while a majority of 51% said they worry sometimes.

Still, 18% said they rarely worry, while 10% said they never do. Those who changed their daily routines were those who worried rarely or more often.

Asian Americans also turned out to be the most critical of all racial groups toward their local officials’ response to violence. Forty-three percent said they were doing a very or somewhat bad job, while 22% of Hispanic, 16% of Black and 15% of White respondents said the same.

As for solutions, about half (48%) of Asian American respondents opted for making stronger laws against hate crimes. Others believe the most effective response would be to create community watch programs (16%), increase local police presence (14%), or elect more Asian Americans to office (13%).

The survey, which was conducted about a year after the 2021 Atlanta spa shootings, included English-speaking Asian Americans only. The results therefore may not be representative of the overall Asian population, the authors said.

5/13/2022,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Wednesday the Chinese government opposes an effort in Congress to ramp up U.S. semiconductor manufacturing because it will give the United States more of a competitive punch. On Thursday, U.S. lawmakers will open formal negotiations on a compromise measure that would fund $52 billion in semiconductor manufacturing subsidies and boost U.S. competitiveness with Chinese technology. It could still take months to reach a final deal. Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito asked Raimondo at a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing about a Reuters story and other reports that China had been pushing U.S. executives, companies and business groups to fight against China-related bills in Congress. ""It doesn't surprise me at all. China doesn't want us to pass this bill. They know that this bill will enable us to outcompete them,"" Raimondo said, saying China had invested $160 billion in domestic semiconductor production. ""The last thing they want is for us to invest $52 billion."" Raimondo said she had heard the reports China was lobbying U.S. businesses, saying they were ""deeply concerning ... The reason China is so against it is because they know how important it is for us."" The Chinese Embassy did not immediately comment. Reuters reported in November China's embassy in Washington had sent letters pressing executives to urge members of Congress to alter or drop specific bills that seek to enhance U.S. competitiveness, according to the sources and the text of a letter sent by the embassy's economic and commercial office seen by Reuters. Chinese officials warned companies they would risk losing market share or revenue in China if the legislation becomes law, according to the text of the letter. China has said it opposes such legislation, arguing it stokes anti-China sentiment and it's based on Cold War-era thinking. A persistent shortage of chips has disrupted the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some companies to scale back production. Raimondo and others have called boosting chips production a national security issue.
