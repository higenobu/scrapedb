4/30/2022,"It has been two years since Richard Scarborough ditched his ageing diesel vehicle in favour of using car clubs, and the 60-year-old graphic designer from Hackney says he can’t see himself ever going back. In Oxford, Emily Kerr is part of a carshare in which 20 households share seven neighbour-owned vehicles. She is so delighted with the way it has gone that she has started helping others set up similar schemes. Scarborough and Kerr are among the growing number of people who have found that it is perfectly possible to get around without owning the car they drive by hiring or sharing one an hour at a time. “Most cars sit unused for the vast majority of the time, so it makes perfect sense for communities to share them,” Kerr says. “It’s better for the environment, and it’s certainly better for your bank balance.” It has been six months since she set up ShareOurCars in east Oxford and she says it is hard to imagine how it could have gone better. Hers is a “closed loop” carshare scheme, meaning only those who live locally can use it, provided they don’t have a poor driving history. The group partnered with the carshare provider hiyacar, which vets new entrants, provides the online booking system, and the all-important insurance. The cars are owned by individual members of the scheme. Two months into the project, Kerr sold the family Honda SUV to use the shared vehicles instead. “There are five cars all less than five minutes’ walk from my house,” she says. “If I need to use a car, I log on and book it, paying about £7 a hour for short hops – less an hour for longer drives. We have a WhatsApp group to talk to each other. And if I needed to get a car in an emergency, I’d be very surprised if I couldn’t get one straight away.” She says she typically pays £90 to get a car for the weekend, usually borrowing it from someone who drives most days during the week, but rarely on Saturday and Sunday. “Most people have quite predictable driving patterns, so you soon get to know whose car is going to be free at any one time,” she says. She says the group have not had any serious accidents or disagreements. It helps that most of the owners view cars as a form of transport rather than their pride and joy. To get her through the summer holidays, she has just leased an MG electric car for four months, which will soon go into the car pool to be shared by other users. “Our car used to cost us just over £300 a month in insurance, depreciation, maintenance, tax, etc. For the last six months I would say we have spent £100 on average.” In east London, the introduction of the capital’s ultra-low emission zone meant Scarborough faced having to sell his diesel car or pay a charge of £12.50 a day to use it. “I weighed up buying a newer car that would conform to Ulez but decided to give the carsharing schemes a go before I did, and I am so glad I did,” he says. He generally uses his bicycle for short local trips, and a mix of car sources whenever he needs four wheels – the commercial sharing schemes Hiyacar and Zipcar, or a conventional rental from the Sixt office not far from his home. “Getting a vehicle has never been a problem. It really helps that there are so many car clubs in this area. I am virtually assured of being able to get one – even at the very last minute,” he says. “The cars aren’t luxury models but they do the job. Zipcar has vans which are useful sometimes.” On average he pays about £10 an hour and his bill is typically £50 a month. “I don’t have to worry about a big maintenance bill, and I am not adding another unnecessary car to the road. Once you are onboard with how it works, it becomes normal. For our main summer holiday last year we took the train to Scotland and then hired a campervan when we got there. In the past we would have probably driven the whole way,” he says. Graeme Risby, the Hiyacar chief executive and co-founder, says the cost of living crisis means there has never been a better time to try car sharing. “For us the motivation was to have fewer cars on the roads – to get communities and neighbours sharing vehicles that were often sitting unused outside people’s homes,” he says. “In the early days (2016) we wanted people to post their cars on the platform, and we provided the insurance, with anyone able to borrow the car. “We now see the closed-loop schemes as increasingly important – particularly in rural areas. It seems people like to know that their car is being used by their near neighbours. As the national fleet moves over to electric, these schemes are going to become the future because we know not everyone can buy a £30,000-£40,000 electric vehicle.” Provided you are at least 21 and don’t have more than six penalty points on your licence, it is easy to borrow a carshare car. There are now a host of clubs to choose from. It is all arranged online and it is a case of registering and uploading your driving licence. Zipcar may be the best known car club but users say it has become pricier. Hiyacar is another provider that is worth a go. It has lots of cars in the UK’s bigger cities – branded cars belonging to finance firms and standard cars owned by other households. For a two-hour hire of a Seat Ibiza in Bromley this weekend, Hiyacar quoted us £11.72. Its typical daily charge is £45. There is a £500 insurance excess, meaning you have to pay the first £500 of any damage you cause, although regular users would be advised to buy excess cover from £45 a year. Generally, you return the car with the same fuel as at pickup. Cars are photographed before and after the share takes place, so any damage is noted. If you would like to rent out your car to neighbours, it’s free to register with Hiyacar. You block out the times you need the car, leaving it available for your neighbours to use at other times. The car is insured by the club, meaning that your no-claims bonus is unaffected if a sharer has an accident, although you will face the disruption of having it repaired.",Lifestyle/Money,Car sharing: is now the time to give up owning a vehicle?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/30/car-sharing-is-now-the-time-to-give-up-owning-a-vehicle
4/30/2022,"Why is the Anglo-Saxon world so individualistic, and why has China leaned towards collectivism? Was it Adam Smith, or the Bill of Rights; communism and Mao? According to at least one economist, there might be an altogether more surprising explanation: the difference between wheat and rice. You see, it’s fairly straightforward for a lone farmer to sow wheat in soil and live off the harvest. Rice is a different affair: it requires extensive irrigation, which means cooperation across parcels of land, even centralised planning. A place where wheat grows favours the entrepreneur; a place where rice grows favours the bureaucrat. The influence of the “initial conditions” that shape societies’ development is what Oded Galor has been interested in for the past 40 years. He believes they reverberate across millennia and even seep into what we might think of as our personalities. Whether or not you have a “future-oriented mindset” – in other words, how much money you save and how likely you are to invest in your education – can, he argues, be partly traced to what kinds of crops grew well in your ancestral homelands. (Where high-yield species such as barley and rice thrive, it pays to sacrifice the immediate gains of hunting by giving over some of your territory to farming. This fosters a longer-term outlook.) Differences in gender equality around the world have their roots in whether land required a plough to cultivate – needing male strength, and relegating women to domestic tasks – or hoes and rakes, which could be used by both sexes. Galor has been interested in a lot more besides; his book, The Journey of Humanity, stretches from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the present day, and has a lot to say about the future, too. In just over 240 pages it covers our migration out of Africa, the development of agriculture, the Industrial Revolution and the phenomenal growth of the past two centuries. It takes in population change, the climate crisis and global inequality. There will be inevitable comparisons with Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens, not least because this too is a work of “macrohistory” and Galor is also from Israel, though he has taught at Brown University in the US for the past 30 years. “If you’re born in a place that is incredibly rich in history, you understand that you’re part of a long, long lineage. You see the Temple Mount that was there 3,000 years earlier. You’re really walking in history. So the link to earlier stages of development is very much part of my upbringing in Jerusalem.” The Journey of Humanity is certainly being pitched, at least in terms of impact, as another Sapiens – translation rights have already been sold in 27 languages. But the similarities may be quite superficial. Sapiens was first published when Harari was a young professor, based on a series of lectures to undergraduates. The Journey of Humanity is the culmination of Galor’s career, the recasting of an earlier work, a maths-and-data-heavy book called Unified Growth Theory, in digestible form. And while Sapiens ends on an equivocal note, warning that present-day civilisation teeters between the singularity and armageddon, the signal characteristic of The Journey of Humanity is its optimism. If you need an evidence-based antidote to doomscrolling, here it is. The extraordinary increases in standards of living, huge falls in child mortality, incredible gains in knowledge and technology – these are the products of inexorable forces that are not going anywhere, Galor argues, and will only augment as time goes on. Even pandemics and wars, horrific as they are for the millions caught up in them, “cannot divert the journey of humanity from its long-term path”. Surprisingly, given the circumstances we find ourselves in, the book is highly persuasive: Galor builds his case meticulously, always testing his assumptions against the evidence, and without the sense of agenda-pushing that accompanies other boosterish thinkers – the Steven Pinkers or Francis Fukuyamas of this world. What sets him apart, perhaps, is a grounding in numbers. “I was an unusual economist in the sense that I always had sort of a deep interest in the mathematics of discrete dynamical systems,” he tells me. Examples of discrete dynamical systems include populations of bacteria or human beings that evolve constrained by things such as food supply or susceptibility to disease. Zooming from his office in Rhode Island, Galor speaks evenly, sounding as though he is always about to break into a half-smile. Like Pinker, he has a shock of silvery hair that approaches his shoulders. “I was sort of an interdisciplinary student, very interested in macro-history, very interested in political science, very interested in economics, and very interested in mathematics. So part of my ability to construct this unified theory of economic growth was those deep mathematical foundations.” What is his theory, then, and how does it appear to break new ground? Economists have always found it difficult to reconcile two distinct eras. During the first, any increase in resources led only briefly to greater prosperity. More food, for example, meant people could raise more children. But the gains were lost because a bigger population meant everyone had a smaller share of the pie. This is known as the “Malthusian trap” after the gloomy clergyman and demographer Thomas Malthus, and it lasted a couple of hundred thousand years. Then, suddenly, beginning in the 18th century, everything changed. In an increasingly technological world, it paid to be literate and better trained. As a result, parents focused their resources on raising a smaller number of children equipped with the skills they needed to make it in the world. They were investing in “human capital”, and soon the state did too: quite quickly the whole population became much better educated. That meant it was more likely to invent new things that made it easier to produce wealth, which was in turn ploughed back into human capital: a virtuous cycle. The rocket ship of progress took off. You might assume that different rules were operating in these two different periods. Galor’s “unified” theory yokes them together, arguing that the underlying engine of growth has always been the same. “I basically model how the advancement of technology feeds back into both the scale of the population and human adaptation, and how in turn, human adaptation and the scale of the population advances technology.” This has been going on, he says, since “the very dawn of the human species”. So why that sudden change around 1760? Galor likens it to another kind of dynamical system – water boiling in a kettle. The heat of innovation begins the moment you switch it on, but only at a certain point near the end do bubbles riotously break the surface. The accumulated increase in temperature brings the system to a tipping point. The Malthusian trap, Galor says, simply “vanishes”, just as water turns to steam. But unlike with a kettle, there’s no off switch, because the “heat” of technological innovation is a self-reinforcing process. Viewed in this way, the Industrial Revolution was a benign development: less dark satanic mills than sunlit uplands. But what about the hideous conditions, the slums, children put to work in factories because their little hands could reach into the moving parts to clear away debris? Galor argues that industrialisation in fact more or less eradicated child labour, and had the added bonus of instigating universal education. Because of the demands of subsistence living, child labour had been an “intrinsic element of human societies throughout history,” he writes. At the time of the Industrial Revolution, however, it had reached a peak that only further technological change could remedy. It did that in two ways: first, machines quickly became better at doing the kind of basic work children had been used for. Second, the need for a skilled workforce meant that it was in employers’ – and parents’ – interests for children to learn rather than work. Universal education followed, spurred on by industrialists, and opposed only by the landed gentry who realised that if tenant farmers’ children went to school, they would go and get better jobs elsewhere. In any case, Galor’s data shows that “the scourge of child labour first disappeared in the most industrialised nations and, within them, in the most industrialised areas”. It’s a little harder to see another side effect of industrialisation through rose-tinted glasses. A huge increase in pollution made lives dirty and difficult at the time, but has bequeathed an even deadlier legacy to us and future generations: climate change. Can Galor really be optimistic about that too? “So my view is a bit complex,” he says carefully. “What triggered climate change is, yes, pollution created since the Industrial Revolution. At the same time, that revolution created two additional important trends. First, it started a fertility decline that initially occurred in the western world and gradually diffused around the globe. Even India is now having fertility just at replacement level, which is incredible. And then at the same time, we know that this decline in fertility freed an enormous amount of resources for investment in human capital.” With that comes greater potential for technological progress. “If the growth of population starts to decline, this itself will reduce the current trend of carbon emissions. And then the power of innovation causes me to be confident that perhaps within two or three decades, we will have revolutionary technologies that will reverse those emissions. Now, we cannot envision what these revolutionary technologies will be. But I do believe, as we saw in the context of Covid, that such technologies will emerge and will allow us to prevail.” If that seems like a stunning gamble, Galor is clear that he’s not for putting all our eggs in a techno-utopian basket. He clarifies that “actions to mitigate carbon emission are critical ingredients in averting the potential catastrophic consequences of climate change”. It’s just that he believes there are two other vital weapons in our arsenal: fertility decline and innovation, both of them inevitable consequences of growth. Not that he recommends simply watching and hoping; he has policy prescriptions too. In the case of the climate crisis, they come a bit out of left field. Climate policy should not stop at cutting carbon: it should involve pushing hard for gender equality, access to education and the availability of contraceptives, to help drive forward the decline in fertility. Demographic advocacy like this, he says, might be better received by developing countries than an insistence on regulating industry, since “they provide the benefits of economic growth alongside environmental preservation”. Growth is good, then, but no one needs reminding that its benefits haven’t been felt equally. Explaining the different trajectories of countries since the 18th century takes up as much room in The Journey of Humanity as the mechanism of growth itself. The basic idea is that those places that were a little bit further behind in the run up to the Industrial Revolution soon found themselves left in the dust. This is where the “initial conditions” really came into their own. So, perhaps your land had been less suitable for growing high-yield crops. Or maybe you lived in a part of the world beset by livestock-bothering Tsetse flies. Politics and institutions played their part too: in 1485, for example, the Ottoman sultan banned movable type printing using the Arabic script in order to protect religious interests, ceding a head start to northern European nations that took up the invention with alacrity. As progress gathered pace, countries that started out with an advantage pressed it ruthlessly, enslaving and colonising others, and using the expropriated resources to turbo-charge their own growth. Once industrialisation started in earnest, the colonised were essentially held in a state of arrested development, farming to provide food and raw materials for their imperial masters, whose economies were freed up even further to specialise in advanced technologies. There’s one remaining part of the jigsaw. To explain it, Galor starts with a colourful analogy. He asks us to imagine a land mass that has five different colours of parrot on it: blue, yellow, black, green and red. A hurricane hits, and some of the parrots are blown on to a neighbouring island. It’s unlikely that every kind of parrot would have been picked up by the winds; perhaps only the green, blue and red ones, making this breakaway population less diverse. In time, a few of these parrots migrate to another island, and again they represent only a subset of the population: just the blue and red ones. This third population is even less diverse. Galor argues that this is precisely what happened when Homo sapiens left Africa, and the pattern was repeated with each onward migration. Africa is the most diverse place on the planet, genomically and culturally, and diversity has a knock-on effect on prosperity. It accounts for about a quarter of the otherwise unexplained variation between nations, Galor calculates; in contrast, diseases (the Tsetse fly, malaria etc) account for one seventh, and political institutions (democracies versus autocracies) less than one tenth. What is it about diversity that makes such a big impact? Social cohesiveness – low diversity, in other words – can have its benefits, particularly in earlier phases of development. But in the modern world, or the boiling kettle phase, cultural fluidity is the greatest driver of innovation. “Like biological breeding, the mating of ideas … benefits from a broader pool of individuals,” he writes. That mating of ideas gives rise to new policies, new inventions and enhanced productivity, stoking the engine of growth. Culturally fluid societies are also more likely to be able to adapt to changing conditions. Galor believes, not uncontroversially, that there might be a sweet spot between homogeneity and fragmentation, where diversity and cross-pollination thrive without undermining social cohesiveness. Countries may sit outside of that spot in either direction: they can be stultifyingly monocultural, or fractious and prone to civil strife. In 2012, he was challenged by a group of academics who warned that the suggestion of an “ideal level of genetic variation” could be misused to “justify indefensible practices such as ethnic cleansing”. Galor responded that the criticism was based on a “gross misinterpretation” of his conclusions. And the policy prescriptions they generate are, on the face of them, benign. “If Bolivia, which has one of the least diverse populations, would foster cultural diversity, its per capita income could increase as much as fivefold,” he writes. “If Ethiopia – one of the world’s most diverse countries – were to adopt policies to enhance social cohesion and tolerance of difference, it could double its current income per capita.” Rather than saying that genes equal destiny, Galor’s message appears to be that whatever the circumstances you have inherited, change is possible. It’s an analysis of the human condition that leads not to a counsel of despair, but a new set of tools he believes can help build a better future. But is that all wishful thinking? I ask whether his innately sunny disposition means we should distrust his intuitions. “I think that I do have a positive outlook in my personal life. Naturally that must be projected on to the way that I view the world.” “But when I’m projecting my optimism,” he adds, “I’m projecting it based on my study of history.” Galor contends that his work goes beyond intuition, even beyond theory: “This has all been explored empirically, in a rigorous way.” It’s tempting, particularly at this moment in history, to bask in a silver-haired sage’s confidence in his facts and figures. Maybe that in itself should cause our sceptical antennae to twitch. For many, though, a dose of faith in human progress will be hard to resist.

4/30/2022,"The senior Conservative MP under investigation for allegedly watching pornography on his phone in the House of Commons chamber has suggested he may have opened it accidentally but has rejected calls to stand down as an MP immediately. Neil Parish, the MP for Tiverton and Honiton in Devon, had the whip suspended after becoming the fourth MP from his party since the last election to face claims of impropriety. Parish revealed he had referred himself to the standards commissioner on Friday afternoon after senior Tory women expressed outrage at the party for failing to act on complaints made earlier this week despite being aware of his identity. In a statement, the 65-year-old wrote on his website: “I will be cooperating fully with any investigation, and whilst it is ongoing I will continue to perform my duties as MP for Tiverton and Honiton.” Asked later by broadcasters if he had opened something in error in the Commons, he said: “I did, but let the inquiry look at that.” However, there were suggestions that a Tory minister also saw him watching porn on a second occasion, in a committee meeting. Parish said he would consider his position as an MP after the result of the investigation, telling reporters: “I will not remain if I am found guilty.” His wife, Sue Parish, told the Times the accusations were “all very embarrassing”, adding: “My breath was taken away, frankly. “People shouldn’t be looking at pornography. He would never just sit there with people looking. He would never just do that knowing [people were looking]. These ladies were quite right to be as [upset] as they were. Describing her husband as a “normal … lovely person”, she added: “If you were mad with every man who looked at pornography, you would not have many wives in the world. “It’s degrading. It’s demeaning. But on the other hand it takes two to tango. There must be women posing for all this.” When asked what the accusations could mean for her husband’s career, she replied: “I’ve got no idea. It depends on what Chris Heaton-Harris [the Tory chief whip] says, I suppose. I don’t think it’s going to carry on, is it? It’s so stupid. He’s such a good MP. He’s such a good person.” Labour accused the Tory whips of trying to “cover up” for Parish before finally deciding to withdraw the whip on Friday. If found to have brought the Commons into disrepute, Parish could be sanctioned and face the possibility of a recall petition, potentially triggering a byelection, if suspended from parliament for more than 10 days. Allegations of a porn-watching parliamentarian were first aired by Tory MPs in a meeting with Heaton-Harris, the party’s chief whip, on Tuesday. Heaton-Harris suspended Parish, who has represented his constituency since 2010, from the parliamentary Conservative party pending the outcome of an investigation after they spoke on Friday afternoon. Harriet Harman told the BBC Radio 4 PM programme that Parish should stand down as an MP. “This marks a new low for the House of Commons,” the senior Labour MP said. “It is not right for him to go through the investigation processes if that is what he has done. Clearly he is not fit to be in parliament. He should accept that and not drag the processes out.” It was understood that the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), which looks into claims of bullying and sexual harassment, had begun examining events after at least one witness made a referral. A second investigation could be launched after Parish’s commitment to refer himself to Kathryn Stone, , the independent parliamentary commissioner for standards, who may consider whether Parish broke the MPs’ code of conduct by causing “significant damage to the reputation and integrity” of the Commons. Parish gave an interview to GB News this week in which he was asked about allegations of a then unidentified Tory MP watching pornography in the Commons. “I think the whips’ office will do a thorough investigation and we will wait and see that result and from that, then the decision will have to be made what action will be taken,” he said. Pressed on whether there was a problem with the culture at Westminster, Parish said: “We’ve got some 650 members of parliament in what is a very intense area. You are going to get people who step over the line. It does have to be dealt with and dealt with seriously.”",News/Politics,Tory MP says he may have opened porn by mistake in Commons,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/30/tory-mp-neil-parish-says-opened-porn-mistake-commons
4/30/2022,"Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison will go head to head in a second leaders’ debate less than a fortnight out from the federal election, the Nine network has announced. It follows days of backroom negotiations between the two major parties while the opposition leader recovered from his recent bout of Covid-19. The National Press Club and free-to-air networks ABC and Seven have also pushed for debates however Morrison indicated on Thursday he would only accept commercial networks. The hour-long debate, to take place at 8.30pm on Sunday 8 May will employ a panel of three journalists to interview the two leaders, Nine reported. Robodebt returned to the headlines on Saturday following Labor’s announcement it would launch a royal commission into the discredited scheme if it wins government. The automated matching of tax and Centrelink data to raise debts against welfare recipients was introduced by the Coalition in 2016, and illegally raised $1.8bn in debts against nearly 500,000 Australians. A settlement was reached between robodebt victims and the federal government in 2020 after the scheme was ruled unlawful in 2019. But the Coalition has never detailed who was accountable for the scandal. The Australian Council of Social Service chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said Acoss would be an “enthusiastic participant” if it goes ahead and it was an “appropriate and proportionate” commitment. The royal commission, budgeted at up to $30m, would be tasked with establishing who was responsible for the scheme, what advice was used in its implementation, and complaints handling processes. Albanese said robodebt had caused “untold misery”. “Against all evidence, and all the outcry, the government insisted on using algorithms instead of people to pursue debt recovery against Australians who in many cases had no debt to pay,” he said in Perth on Saturday. Labor’s Bill Shorten said robodebt preyed on “vulnerable” citizens including pensioners, the unemployed, people with disabilities and university students. “I have spoken to families who absolutely believe that the pressure of the unfair debt notices raised against loved family members contributed to them taking their own life,” he said. “The robodebt campaign over four years was the government going to war with its own people and it didn’t have the legal authority … Australians are owed an answer.” Morrison is facing backlash for suggesting it was “hypocritical” for Labor to hold a royal commission into robodebt. “There’s been court matters which we’ve fully cooperated in and almost $750m in reimbursements have been made by the government and changes to the scheme have been put in place,” he said. “I find it quite hypocritical that a scheme that the Labor party actually introduced for income averaging – in assessing people’s welfare entitlements – that they now seek to criticise the government for when the Labor party do this all the time.” The prime minister was in Tasmania alongside the Bass MP, Bridget Archer, on Saturday arguing the election was about a strong economy for a strong future. “You may not like everything we’ve done, you may not like me that much, but that’s not the point,” he said at a Launceston campaign rally. “The point is you know what our plan is ... now is not the time to take a risk on what you don’t know.” Morrison was also facing continued pressure over China’s security deal with the Solomon Islands, and defended the home affairs minister Karen Andrews’ suggestion China timed the agreement to coincide with Australia’s election. The prime minister said the government was “very aware” of the influence the Chinese government seeks to have in Australia and “introduced laws to prevent it”. “We didn’t put that legislation in for no reason,” he said. “We put it in there to ensure that Australian security could be safeguarded from foreign influence in our own country.” When asked about China’s vice-foreign minister’s suggestion Morrison’s criticism of the deal amounted to “intimidation”, he replied: “The Chinese government would say that, wouldn’t they?” Earlier in the day, the prime minister announced a $150m cash splash from 2023 on medications listed under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Australians will have to wait until 1 January if the Coalition wins the election for the new measures, aimed at easing cost-of-living aches hitting the country. The measure means a $10 savings per script, with PBS-listed medicines dropping from $42.50 to $32.50 for everyday conditions such as high blood pressure and cholesterol. Pharmacists welcomed the announcement. When asked repeatedly why the government saved the announcement as an election promise rather than including the medications cut in this year’s budget, Morrison said it was a “longer term measure”.
