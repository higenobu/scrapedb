2/19/2022,"Greek rescue forces were desperately trying to extinguish fires raging for a second day on an Italian cruise liner off the coast of Corfu, as the search for 12 people believed to be missing intensified. Firefighters battled flames leaping from the ferry’s interior as state TV showed images of the Italian-flagged Euroferry Olympia engulfed in thick, acrid smoke. Efforts to bring the blaze under control were hampered by gale-force winds on Saturday, while intense heat from the ship made it impossible for rescuers to land on it, the broadcaster reported.  “The fire is still burning and firefighting vessels have been trying to put it out,” Greece’s shipping minister, Ioannis Plakiotakis, told Skai television. Hundreds of passengers were saved in what Plakiotakis described as a heroic rescue operation after the boat’s Italian captain ordered people to abandon ship when the fire broke out at 4.12am on Friday. As night fell, two men – a Bulgarian and an Afghan migrant – trapped in the ship’s garage were airlifted by commandos winched down to the ship from a Super Puma helicopter. The 65-year-old Bulgarian was reported to be in critical condition in Corfu’s general hospital. Officials said an array of vessels from different arms of the navy, as well as elite forces, were participating in the rescue operation. “We are doing everything to save those who are missing,” said the Greek coastguard spokesperson, Nikolaos Alexiou, clarifying that they were all men. Asked if it was not too late, he said: “The aim is to find them.” The shipping ministry said passengers who remained unaccounted for included nationals from Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey and Lithuania. All were thought to be lorry drivers. Nine people, including two rescuers, had spent the night in hospital with most suffering from respiratory problems. Among the 280 people who had managed to flee the stricken ship were children, babies and two migrants not on the official passenger list who were described as stowaways. All had spent the night in hotels on the Ionian island. Bound for Brindisi, the 183-meter Grimaldi Lines ferry had set sail from Igoumenitsa, the largest port in western Greece, with 239 passengers and 51 crew members officially on board. The fire is believed to have started on a third level car deck, 10 miles north of Corfu, according to a statement released by the Italian shipping company. A total of 25 vehicles and 153 trucks were registered on the ship. Rescued passengers likened scenes to the Titanic, saying once it became clear the fire could not be brought under control, and flames reached the passenger deck, “panic and chaos” broke out on board. “It was so unreal, it was a bit like the Titanic, but it was real,” David Waller, a 58-year-old rescued trucker told Reuters. Another lorry driver, described as Albanian, said he thought death had “come for me”. “There was so much smoke. I thought we wouldn’t make it,” he told Greek state TV. “It took us about an hour and a half before we got into the lifeboats and about three more hours before we were picked up.” Many said they had lost everything to the blaze, listing passports, money, luggage, trucks and vehicles. An Italian finance police boat, which happened to be in the region, was credited with playing a seminal role in the rescue operation, with the country’s president, Sergio Mattarella, personally calling the finance unit’s commander to thank him. Local fishing boats also rushed to the scene to search for people who may have jumped into the water. The ferry’s captain and two mechanics appeared before a public prosecutor on Saturday as a judicial investigation was formally launched. Greek officials described the incident as the worst maritime disaster since 2014, when the Italian-owned passenger ferry Norman Atlantic caught fire in the Adriatic Sea with as many as 22 people – including illegal immigrants who had sneaked on board – losing their lives. Athens’ shipping ministry said once the fire was extinguished, the Euroferry Olympia would be tugged to a safe place so that its tanks could be emptied to avoid an environmental disaster in the area.",News/World news,Rescue forces search for 12 missing people in ferry fire near Corfu,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/corfu-ferry-fire-euroferry-olympia-latest
2/19/2022,"The Fox News host Tucker Carlson attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Friday night, claiming the US congresswoman was not a woman of colour. “She’s a rich entitled white lady,” he said.  In return, the New York Democrat, popularly known as AOC, said: “This is the type of stuff you say when your name starts with a P and ends with dejo.” Dictionary.com defines pendejo as “a mildly vulgar insult for ‘asshole’ or ‘idiot’ in Spanish”. “Once again,” Ocasio-Cortez added, “the existence of a wife or daughters doesn’t make a man good. And this one is basura.” Basura is Spanish for “trash”. She also accused Carlson of sexual harassment. Ocasio-Cortez’s mother is from Puerto Rico, her father from the Bronx. She has described herself as a woman of colour. Carlson said: “No one ever dares to challenge that description, but every honest person knows it is hilariously absurd. “There is no place on Earth outside of American colleges and newsrooms where Sandy Cortez” – Carlson’s derisory nickname for the New York congresswoman – “would be recognized as a quote, woman of color, because she’s not! “She’s a rich entitled white lady. She’s the pampered obnoxious ski bunny in the matching snowsuit who tells you to pull up your mask while you’re standing in the lift line at Jackson Hole. They’re all the same. It doesn’t matter what shade they are.” The leading provocateur in Fox News’ evening line-up was discussing a book about Ocasio-Cortez, Take Up Space: The Unprecedented AOC, written by Lisa Miller, a reporter at New York magazine. Carlson said Miller’s book was “like a box of Fig Newtons. You know it’s wrong to open it, but the temptation is strong, and so we did.” As the media watchdog Mediate put it, several of the passages Carlson read were “fawning in nature and weave mundane videos AOC has posted online – such as her assembling Ikea furniture – into a grand narrative about her life”. In one passage, Carlson said, the congresswoman is described as “pointedly” saying into a camera, “I’m alone today”. “Is it just us or does that sound like an invitation to a booty call?” Carlson said. “Maybe one step from ‘What are you wearing?’ Either way it’s a little strange. It’s definitely over-sharing and yet, according to the book, over-sharing is the key to Sandy Cortez’s success.” Ocasio-Cortez wrote: “Remember when the right wing had a meltdown when I suggested they exhibit obsessive impulses around young women? Well now Tucker Carlson is wishing for … this on national TV. “You’re a creep, bro. If you’re this easy with sexual harassment on air, how are you treating your staff?”",News/US news,AOC calls Tucker Carlson ‘trash’ for saying she is not a woman of colour,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/19/aoc-tucker-carlson-ocasio-cortez-fox-news-woman-of-colour
2/19/2022,"Across the pages of Amy Liptrot’s new memoir, The Instant, the moon slowly follows us: in the app she has downloaded on to her phone to chart the phases of its orbit; passing through the sky, just visible from the windows of her apartment in Berlin’s Kreuzberg district; and in the subheadings she has awarded to each chapter (Thunder Moon, Hunger Moon, Strawberry Moon). It is the book’s steady presence: ancient and constant in an otherwise dislocated tale of fevered love in the digital age. Today, Liptrot, 40, stands in the kitchen of her terraced house in Yorkshire, making tea on a cold midmorning. Tall and pale and slender, she is something like a sliver of moonlight herself – if the moon wore pink cords and a violet top and spoke with a silvery Orcadian accent.  Liptrot’s life these days is some way from the one she described in her 2016 debut, The Outrun. Then, she was newly returned to the family farm in Scotland after a hedonistic decade in London. As she rehabilitated from alcoholism, she found solace and sustenance in the nature of the islands. This life is different, too, from the year she documents in The Instant, in which she left Orkney and relocated to Berlin, spending her time wheeling across her new city, working in a tea-packing factory, dancing, dating, searching for raccoons, companionship, love. But for the last few years Liptrot has been settled here, with her partner and their two small children, in a house looking down over the rooftops of their close-knit town. She is, she points out, about as far as you can get from the coast – a strange feeling for someone who grew up by the sea. This calm, domestic existence is a subject she has yet to write about, and perhaps never will, having come to realise that keeping part of yourself back is crucial to the art of memoir-writing. “There’s a tendency, if you read about somebody’s life, to think that you have the entire picture, when really that’s an illusion,” she says. “Even though it’s a memoir, it’s carefully selected, and crafted, and there’s actually a lot that’s left out. I see myself as a writer, rather than somebody who has a sensational life.” And so she is nervous, she says, about being interviewed today. We sit in her living room, with its bookshelves and binoculars and small wood-burning stove. Liptrot perches on the edge of her sofa, and for much of our conversation casts her eyes down. Between us, on her coffee table, sits a book about the moon. “I’ve kind of got used to this thing with people I meet,” Liptrot says. “I can see in their eyes that they know quite a lot about me, and it bypasses a lot of small talk. They want to get into deep stuff straight away.” In her debut, Liptrot wrote of the gradual escalation of addiction: losing her job, her lover, her home; isolating herself, drinking alone; the desire for alcohol blurring her judgment and heightening risk, leaving her with few routes out. There was a cool radiance to the way she wrote, a willingness to get into that same deep stuff, that made for something remarkable. The book became a bestseller, won both the Wainwright and the PEN Ackerley prizes, and is now set to be turned into a film by the German director Nora Fingscheidt, starring Saoirse Ronan. Still, that openness brought a responsibility. It forged a fierce bond with her readers, who write to her and seek her out at readings. “They want to tell me about the parallels between their life and mine,” she says. “The most amazing thing is the people who are trying to get sober, or who are newly sober, who’ve said the book’s helped them. Or people who have addicts in their life who say that the book’s helped them to understand and have compassion for those people. That has been incredible for me and the greatest gift of my life, I would say.” This sense of connection galvanised her writing. “The fact that people will come on board with me, to keep on following down the things that I felt were interesting or worthwhile rather than what other people are writing about,” she says. “It gave me that confidence to follow my own instinct.” Liptrot thought about those readers a great deal when deciding whether to adapt The Outrun; it was the strength of that bond, their investment in her book and its subject matter, that convinced her it was a worthwhile enterprise. She worries about representing its characters and Orkney well, and plans to evolve the narrative and even the central character’s name so it feels less autobiographical. “Having your book made into a film is a huge honour and thrill,” she says, “but also comes with a lot of nerves and responsibility … The way I’m stopping myself going bonkers is by concentrating on the work that needs doing – on making a piece of art distinct from the book.” Now, on the eve of the new book, she is again fretting about letting her readership down. “I’m nervous about it,” she says. “I feel like I’m sort of pushing myself with the book, and taking a few risks both artistic and emotional with it. Now that it’s come to publication, I do have the collywobbles. I feel I’ve got quite a lot to lose.” The Instant is not a straightforward book. It is a fragmentary, episodic account of Liptrot’s time in Berlin, which took inspiration from poetry and song lyrics, from the internet-led alt-lit movement, and Jenny Offill’s novel Dept. of Speculation. “A lot of books that have been published in the last five years or so are quite fragmentary,” Liptrot says. “And I definitely think that’s a product of living on Twitter, and being distracted and how our attention spans are. But also the way that we’re sophisticated enough as readers to process different information in parallel.” It makes for a familiar rhythm for those accustomed to the perpetual scroll and swipe and tab-dance of online life. Liptrot designed each chapter as an extended metaphor: “There’s one about being in a techno club and being underwater. And there’s one that’s about online dating and looking for raccoons. And then there’s one that’s about traffic islands in Berlin and also about the love affair.” These were all interests that were happening concurrently for Liptrot. “I was doing the dating at the same time as I was getting up early to look for goshawks, and staying out late to look for the raccoons,” she says. “In my diaries, these things are mentioned in the same entry.” When she looked back through those entries from that time, she noted a theme pulling these disparate strands together. “There was a kind of searching that’s at the heart of a lot of them,” she says. “A search for love, but more broadly a search for meaning. A very broad message of the book is about finding your own meaning, and finding the things that are important to you.” She mentions her love for the work of the American author Annie Dillard, “and how she talks about giving voice to your own astonishment, which I take as this idea that whatever it might be that interests you as an artist, to really drill down into it”. There are many things that interest Liptrot: “The elements, stuff about geology, physics and astronomy, and then wildlife and birds,” she says. “And if something interests me, I’m going to put it in there, even if I don’t fully understand why. In art, not everything’s explained. It can be a little bit mysterious and magic.” Halfway through the book, and halfway through her time in Berlin, Liptrot finds a hyperfocus in the form of a short but intense love affair. It is giddy and sensuous and full of promise, and when it ends, unexpectedly, she is heartbroken. In her grief, she performs what she describes as “digital archaeology” on their relationship: examining all of their old messages and all of his social media posts for clues; buying online guides to getting your ex back; posting photographs and updates she hopes he might see; following him across the internet, like the moon. “I feel quite exposed having written about that,” she says now. “I feel it’s a bit embarrassing and it’s maybe a bit trivial. However, it was what concerned and obsessed me for a long time, and what my diaries were full of, and I thought, therefore, this must be worth writing about.” She is aware, of course, of the parallels with addiction; that her personality type may be particularly susceptible to the highs of love and the keenness of its loss. “But if I mention it to other people I often get this little gasp of recognition,” she says. “So I think it is a widespread thing that we’re trying to negotiate. I wanted to acknowledge and honour that experience, and look at the weirdnesses and the strangenesses, and the funny bits, and eventually the recovery. But not to get there too quickly, because I was stuck in it for a long time.” Sometimes she feels guilt for not writing about bigger issues. “Why am I writing about heartbreak?” she says. “Why am I not writing about climate change or the refugee crisis?” Not so long ago she told a friend that she feared her subject matter was indulgent and trivial. “And she said, ‘Well, some of those refugees are going to be heartbroken … ’” Since the success of The Outrun, many authors have attempted a similar feat – attempting to find consolation and new life through writing about nature. Liptrot is hesitant to talk about the current state of nature writing. “What can I say about that?” she wonders, and her eyes dart about the room. “I guess I see myself as a nature writer,” she says eventually. “But I want to slightly push the boundaries of what that can include.” She smiles, and her face pinkens. “A lot of nature writing is quite chaste, so I wanted to put the sex into nature writing. So humans as animals, and human instincts, and how the internet and digital technology allows us to amplify our animal instincts is of interest to me, in terms of searching for things, in terms of sexual opportunities, in terms of seasons.” For those who relished the nature-rich elements of The Outrun, there is also plenty of wildlife in The Instant. Liptrot arrives in Berlin feeling “quite lost and quite lonely” but through her exploration of urban wildlife, she finds structure and understanding of her new city, there in each sighting of goshawk and crow, each suggestion of Berlin’s unexpected raccoon population. Early on, she buys a pair of binoculars and takes them out on field trips. “I had the skills that I’d developed on Orkney, understanding the natural world around me and writing about that natural world,” she says. “And I was interested in transferring those skills from the Scottish island to the city: writing about urban wildlife, but writing about human nature as well and human relationships, because nature doesn’t exist just in rural places.” She makes no great claim to be any sort of authority on anything. “It’s not an academic polemic, or a fully researched book,” she says. “For me, it’s about the vibe, it’s about the mood, it’s about a certain place in time. It’s not me trying to fully authoritatively describe Berlin and the subculture. It’s my own experience.” She felt much the same about The Outrun: “That I’m sort of an interested novice birdwatcher,” she says. “I’m not an expert. But the reader comes along with me on my journey of learning.” Recently, Liptrot began looking for a fireproof box in which to keep her diaries – somewhere a little safer than the “big box upstairs” where they currently live. It was a moment, in many ways; an admission that she is now a writer, that this is her job. “My ambition has always been to write my diary for a living,” she says. “Which is kind of what I’m managing to do, and what I really hope I’ll continue to be doing.” I wonder if the voice she uses when writing her diary has changed as a result – whether she is aware now that it will form the basis of something more substantial. She thinks for a moment. “I try not to use it as a place just to moan,” she says. “If there’s a particular sensation or experience, I try to get loads of it down, so I can perhaps go back and use it at a different stage. But my writing process is very long and time-consuming, and the diaries are just one starting point of it.” Any piece of writing will also involve extensive note-taking, research, talking to experts. “I feel like I’ve struck on a process that works quite well but is quite laborious.” Take the moon, for example. “When I was back on Papay [Papa Westray, where much of The Outrun was set] I started getting more and more aware of the moon, and I then kept up that awareness in Berlin,” she says. “I got the app that tells me what the moon phase was, what time it’s going to rise and what direction to look in.” Sometimes, she will mark the full moon with a swim. “With the solstices and the equinox and the movements of the planets, I try to get my head around understanding what they’re actually doing. And I find it pleasing to have a combination of academic book learning and then seeing it happen in real life.” She laughs, and her eyes spring up. “And come on,” she says, “the moon! Poets have been at it for all time! I can’t claim it’s a new thing. But I like knowing it’s up there, holding on to us.”  The Instant is published by Canongate at £14.99 on 3 March.

2/19/2022,"Reality TV used to be so straightforward. Chuck a few attention-seekers in a house, film everything they do, and hope they start bickering about teabags. It was television gold, and its evolution was rapid. Eventually, reality TV ballooned into a monster, hoovering up formats at speed, mining the attention-seeking prowess of people who were already famous – because there’s little risk of them not performing. Which is why Anthea Turner is on a sort-of competition with Lee Ryan from Blue attempting to do entirely invented “challenges” from a 1987 film that featured no challenges, as far as I can recall. Welcome to The Real Dirty Dancing (Monday, 9pm, E4). In recent years we have seen celebrities attempting to row boats around the British Isles, celebrities dating other celebrities and also non-celebrities, and on primetime Saturday nights, celebrities dressing up as cartoon creatures to belt out a tune using a disguised voice until Davina McCall shouts: “Take it off! Take it off!” at them. Has anyone else wondered whether celebrities might need our protection? Is it time to intervene, call a moratorium on letting famous people sign up to anything that suggests it might require a hint of a waiver?  The Real Dirty Dancing falls into a celebrity reality subgenre that borrows a famous film and builds a competitive element round it. The Real Full Monty took a film about a fictional bunch of laid-off Sheffield steelworkers who turned to stripping to pay the bills and used it to get a load of celebrities to take their clothes off for charity. The Real Marigold Hotel borrowed an idea from the whimsical travel movie and sent older celebrities to India to see if they might retire there. Sadly, The Real Quiet Place is yet to be picked up, though I suspect it is only a matter of time. Keith Lemon and Ashley Roberts host this latest creation, which seems to be a cross between a historical re-enactment, a summer camp and a dance competition. The selection pack of famous people is a pitch-perfect cross-section of fame as it stands in 2022. There’s Turner, the oldest of the competitors, and by default the most famous, alongside Saffron Barker, who is a YouTuber apparently, and then a sprinkling of people from Hollyoaks and Geordie Shore and a couple of other TV shows. Bobby Seagull from University Challenge is there, as is Arg from Towie, who is excited to get on the dancefloor after his gastric band surgery, and then there is Ryan, a man single-handedly keeping the fedora alive. In the absence of much of a narrative, apart from getting to the obvious point of the Big Lift, they have to recreate less memorable scenes from the film. It’s basically Secret Cinema with Keith Lemon shouting at you and, I imagine, smaller queues. Not all of these “challenges” – and I say that loosely – involve dancing; one just involves tipping water on a waiter and trying to do an American accent. I found the concept hard to follow, but I think the two men and two women who perform best are chosen to play Baby and Johnny in the final, and then those two couples get to try the lift. As prizes go, it makes Drag Race’s RuPeter Badges look generous, but nobody really cares about who’s good or bad, only how horrifically awkward it can get when famous people are asked to bump and grind when they’ve only just met. The star, so far, is Chelsee Healey from Hollyoaks, who highlights the fact that this is all a gleeful stretch. “We got these big-arse melons banged on us,” she explains, as they carry watermelons into a club, because that’s what Baby does in the film. Healey came second on Strictly, and the spectre of that show looms large. The celebrity reality machine is such a tangled mess that some of the people on here, such as Healey, have already done it, while others would clearly like to do it, which makes this seem like both a training ground and resting home for the big daddy of twinkle-toed telly. This is no Strictly, but it isn’t trying to be. It’s a light, daft, surreal idea, stretched taut over the frame of reality TV, and it should hold, just about, until they’ve had the time of their lives.",Arts/Television & radio,The Real Dirty Dancing: a pitch-perfect cross-section of fame in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/19/the-real-dirty-dancing-a-pitch-perfect-cross-section-of-fame-in-2022

2/19/2022,"The Berlin film festival used to be an oddly contradictory affair. It was known for elaborately kitsch opening and closing ceremonies and competition films heavy on social conscience: champagne on the red carpet, kale juice on the screen. This year’s Berlin was differently strange. The February 2021 festival was online only, but offered the best crop of titles in recent memory. This year, a slightly shorter festival went live again – and if only its selections had been in the same league, it might have offset the event’s strangely desolate feel. The festival’s distribution market had gone online, meaning fewer delegates, partly because of Germany’s still tough Covid restrictions, which insisted on daily tests as a requirement for access to press screenings. All this made the unusually quiet Palast area feel like an art installation tribute to the bygone days of Checkpoint Charlie.  As for the films, much of the competition selection had the glum earnestness of the old Berlinale, with little sense of fearless formal experimentation. But there was some joy to be had. You might have expected a jury chaired by M Night Shyamalan to come up with a last-minute shock twist. The twist was, they didn’t: they awarded the Golden Bear for best film to the title that deserved it, Carla Simón’s Alcarràs. A realist drama about a Catalan family facing eviction from the land where they grow peaches, it’s very political and hugely exuberant. Rich in immersive detail, the film is superbly cast with a teeming ensemble, including three children whom Simón appears to have left to their own devices, to irresistibly anarchic effect. It’s also a historical win: the third top prize in a year for female directors at European festivals, following Julia Ducournau with Titane in Cannes and Audrey Diwan’s Happening in Venice. It was a good year for France. François Ozon’s opening film, Peter von Kant, is a sly tribute to German maestro Rainer Werner Fassbinder, a gender-reversed reinvention of RWF’s 1972 classic The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, with the hulking Denis Ménochet as a lovesick gay auteur very much resembling Fassbinder himself. Also starring original Fassbinder star Hanna Schygulla and another 70s legend, Isabelle Adjani, Peter von Kant is a sly, polished confection of mischief, melancholy and heady melodrama. Another French star auteur, Claire Denis, was here with Both Sides of the Blade, starring Juliette Binoche as a woman caught between her partner (Vincent Lindon) and her smoothie ex. It’s odd to see a radical such as Denis working within the trad parameters of the bourgeois marital drama, but she does it with characteristically unsettling idiosyncrasy. By contrast, Mikhaël Hers’s The Passengers of the Night was a gentle, alt-feelgood drama. Set in 1980s Paris, it features Charlotte Gainsbourg on affecting form as a newly divorced woman who gets a job on a late-night radio show. Perhaps too benignly zen to gaze deep into the story’s darker areas, it’s nevertheless an immensely tender, atmospheric piece – a nostalgia trip with heart and subtlety. The boldest competition entry was Robe of Gems, a troubling, sometimes mystifying Mexican film about a wealthy family who move to a rural villa, with brutal results. Its themes are familiar in Mexican drama – violence, corruption, the gap between rich and poor – but it’s given a genuinely disturbing tremor by debut director Natalia López Gallardo. Previously known as editor to Carlos Reygadas, she has very much developed her own style of nightmare. Outside competition, fringe attractions included Andrew Dominik’s music doc This Much I Know to Be True, which intersperses sparse performances by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis with interludes in which they discuss their working methods, and an intro in which Cave unveils his utterly bizarre set of ceramics portraying the biography of the devil. Then there was Flux Gourmet, by the British arch-conceptualist Peter Strickland. It’s set in an institute where “culinary collectives” literally cook up experimental sound performances. Starring Asa Butterfield and Gwendoline Christie, it’s a little pedantic in its humour, more than somewhat redolent of Peter Greenaway, but visually striking, and it’s good to see Strickland still flying his freak flag on the conformist terrain of UK cinema. More discreetly outré, and the best fun here, was Incredible But True, by Quentin Dupieux, the japester behind Deerskin and Mandibles. His latest shaggy dog story is about a couple who discover something bizarre in the basement of their new home; not so much a thing, more a philosophical conceit that the film explores with irresistibly poker-faced comic logic. As for the festival’s most poignant film, it had to be Italian competition entry Leonora Addio. For decades, Paolo Taviani worked with brother Vittorio as one of cinema’s great sibling duos. Directing solo after Vittorio’s death, he offers a homage to him and to the great Italian writer Luigi Pirandello. Largely comprising a gorgeously shot black-and-white narrative about the return of Pirandello’s ashes to his native Sicily, it’s a blithe, rueful contemplation of art, history and mortality. As a musing on old age, it was nicely matched by Mitra Farahani’s eccentric doc See You Friday, Robinson, in which Jean-Luc Godard (91) exchanges emails with veteran Iranian director and author Ebrahim Golestan (99). Godard sends enigmatic quotes from Dashiell Hammett. Golestan, filmed in his vast, Xanadu-like English home, wryly muses that Godard may be taking the piss. We also get to see Godard ironing his shirts – one of those cinematic firsts you’re truly glad to have witnessed. Golden Bear for best film Alcarràs by Carla Simón Silver Bear grand jury prize The Novelist’s Film, the 27th feature by Korea’s uncannily consistent Hong Sang-soo. As ever, a finely honed comedy of manners and misunderstanding. Silver Bear jury prize Robe of Gems by Natalia López Gallardo. Silver Bear for best director Claire Denis, Both Sides of the Blade (aka Fire). Special mention Switzerland’s Michael Koch for his imposing Alpine drama A Piece of Sky. Silver Bear for best leading performance Meltem Kaptan in Rabiye Kurnaz Vs George W Bush. German-Turkish TV regular Kaptan was boisterously characterful in this comically tinged story of a woman fighting to free her son from Guantánamo. But her crowd-pleasing win shouldn’t obscure other outstanding turns: eg Noémie Merlant and Nahuel Pérez Biscayart in One Year, One Night, about the Bataclan attack; and, above all, larger-than-life Michael Thomas in Ulrich Seidl’s Rimini, as a clapped-out cabaret singer turned part-time gigolo.",Arts/Film,"Berlin film festival 2022 roundup – earnestness, joy, and the best film won",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/19/berlin-film-festival-2022-roundup-earnestness-joy-and-the-best-film-won-alcarras-golden-bear
2/19/2022,"Spare a thought for composers, in the ricocheting tumult of musical life since early 2020. They spend months or years writing a piece for specific musicians, venue, event. Most will earn at most the kind of fee a minor celebrity takes home for a single after-dinner speech. Then the concert is cancelled. John Luther Adams, the veteran “eco” composer, has had to wait two years for the world premiere of A Brief Descent Into Deep Time, his work for Theatre of Voices, co-commissioned by Kings Place, along with the Cork international choral festival and Carnegie Hall. Originally a drummer who then worked in environmental protection in Alaska, Adams (b.1953) writes music inspired by the planet we live on. He calls it “sonic geography”. This latest slow-moving aural meditation on geological strata, intended for Kings Place’s 2020 Nature Unwrapped series, was nimbly shoehorned into this year’s Voices Unwrapped. He is not the first to take the Grand Canyon as his subject, nor will he be the last. Four singers slowly intoned rock names, music falling ever lower, from Kaibab limestone to Vishnu schist. The organist David Bendix Nielsen and percussionist George Barton provided minimal accompaniment. Only the final words, “grey, grey, dark grey, dark grey, black”, were distinguishable, the rest sounding like familiar vowels and consonants that could not quite translate into language.  Not that this mattered: Adams asks you to listen to the mesmerising and extraordinary vibrations of human voices in slow oscillation. Theatre of Voices, directed by Paul Hillier, embraced its weighty intention. The sounds were exquisite but the work stopped short of intimating the magnitude of two billion years. Try Harrison Birtwistle’s Deep Time (2016), complex and melancholy, for contrast. Theatre of Voices also performed David Lang’s 2008 Pulitzer-award winning The Little Match Girl Passion. The work that best showed the group’s talent was Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen’s beguiling Song (2010), based on the lute song Flow, My Tears (1596) by John Dowland, which emerges whole from a soundworld of chokes and sobs. The winning combination of Elgar, Walton, the violinist James Ehnes, the Philharmonia Orchestra and the conductor John Wilson encouraged a big, and wildly enthusiastic, turnout at the Festival Hall (broadcast live on BBC Radio 3). Ehnes, who has the silkiest tone in the business, achieves a level of perfection, full of feeling but without show, that puts him in a class of his own. He was the choice for Walton’s fiendish Violin Concerto (1939), written for the great Jascha Heifetz, similarly renowned for flawless technique and restrained manner. Ehnes gave a poetic performance, bringing out the music’s wistfulness as well as its fury and dazzle. The Royal Festival Hall’s acoustic can play tricks with sound. On this occasion the Philharmonia’s mighty brass sometimes appeared to be accompanied by the rest of the orchestra, but there was no mistaking the excitement and energy of musicians playing at full tilt for a conductor who demands all, and mostly gets it. Elgar’s Symphony No 1, the concert’s other work, presents a stately nobilmente exterior but as it unfurls, myriad tiny motifs eddy and spiral in constant, febrile motion. Without rushing, but always buoyant, Wilson propelled the music forward, so that when the hushed, slow movement melody arrived – marked in the score “expressive and sustained” – a sense of suspended animation took hold, until the trombones, gloriously noisy elsewhere but here muted, released us in the closing bars. The last movement, a summation of so much of the work to that point, romped home in urgent conclusion. Friendship may equal love or grief as a source of musical inspiration. Without his great ally, the horn player Joseph Leutgeb, butt of much scurrilous teasing, Mozart is unlikely to have written so many works for the instrument. The young German horn player Felix Klieser played two of them – the Quintet for Piano and Winds, K452 and the Quintet for Horn and Strings, K407 – with principals of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and pianist Danny Driver on Wednesday (I watched it streamed live; the film is available online until 18 March). This was an excellent opportunity for these musicians to play chamber music with Klieser, their artist in residence, and with each other. The two Mozart works exude spirit and wit. Brahms’s Horn Trio (Klieser, Driver and violinist Mark Derudder), written for the valveless natural horn, is a yearning study in melancholy. Klieser, who was born without arms, plays with his left foot, his horn supported on a tripod. It might be the first thing to note about him. Once he plays, his agile musicianship prevails. The audience at Lighthouse, Poole, gave a standing ovation.
