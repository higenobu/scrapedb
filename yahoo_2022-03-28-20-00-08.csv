3/28/2022,"Russian troops overran a village in the suburbs of Kyiv over the weekend, CNN reported. A Ukrainian woman who lived there told CNN the Russian soldiers were acting out of control. Zina Kilko told CNN the soldiers ransacked her home and drunkenly shot off her husband's leg. A Ukrainian woman whose village was stormed by Russian soldiers says they wore her clothes, stole money, and drunkenly shot her husband in the leg, CNN reported. Zina Kilko told CNN that the Russian soldiers were acting out of control as they ransacked her home in a village close to Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, over the weekend. ""They wore my woman's hat, my coat, my boots. They wore our clothes, they took our bedding ... I don't know what they've done with it,"" Kilko told CNN in an emotional interview. ""They slept, they ate, they wandered about. They stole our money."" Kilko also told CNN one of the Russian soldiers was drunk and used a stolen shotgun to blow her husband's leg off. Two of the Russian soldiers later admitted that they didn't support Putin's invasion of Ukraine, Kilko added. She attended to her husband in the basement of their home for two days before bringing him to the main hospital in Brovary, which is where CNN interviewed her. Kilko's husband was lying in a hospital bed next to her with his leg bandaged as she was being interviewed. Russia has been trying to encircle Kyiv since the beginning of its invasion of Ukraine on February 24. But it has been met with fierce resistance. Ukrainian counter-attacks have pushed Russian forces more than 20 miles away of the capital, Britain's Ministry of Defence said on Friday, according to The Telegraph. After heavy fighting over the weekend, Ukrainian forces also managed to reclaim ground in Brovary, according to the BBC. The nearest Russian troops have advanced is in the western suburbs of Irpin and Bucha, which are about 15 miles from the city center, the BBC reported.

3/28/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Companies exiting Russia due to the war in Ukraine are welcome to move production to Kazakhstan, the country's deputy foreign minister told a German newspaper, saying Kazakhstan would not want to be on the wrong side of a new ""iron curtain."" Countries should not come merely to avoid sanctions against Russia, ""but all companies with a good reputation that want to move their production here are welcome,"" Die Welt on Monday quoted Roman Vasilenko as saying. ""If there is a new iron curtain, we do not want to be behind it,"" he said, referring to the Western term for a dividing line between eastern and western Europe during the Cold War. A raft of Western companies are shuttering businesses in Russia in response to pressure from consumers to take a stand against the invasion of Ukraine. Kazakhstan has avoided criticising Russia's move to invade a fellow ex-Soviet republic, but Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said this month that all countries must strictly adhere to the norms and principles of the United Nations charter.

3/28/2022,"(Updates with Azerbaijan's comments) BAKU, March 26 (Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry said on Saturday Azeri armed forces had entered a zone policed by Russian peacekeepers in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, in a violation of an agreement, but Azerbaijan challenged these claims. Russia said it had called on Azerbaijan to pull out its troops, and was ""applying efforts"" to move forces to their initial positions. It also said Azerbaijan had carried out four drone strikes in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan's defence ministry refuted Moscow's version of events and described Russia's statement as ""one-sided"". It said that ""illegal"" Armenian armed units attempted an act of sabotage, but had to retreat when ""immediate measures"" were applied. It reiterated Azerbaijan's commitment to the ""three-way statement"" - a deal it signed with Armenia and Russia in November 2020 to end the military conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region after more than a month of bloodshed. Azerbaijan emerged as the victor in that conflict, having recaptured territory it had lost in an earlier war between 1991 and 1994. But many questions remain unresolved, including the legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Armenians who live there. Moscow deployed almost 2,000 peacekeepers to the region after the ceasefire, reaffirming its role as policeman and chief power broker in a volatile part of the former Soviet Union where Turkey also wields increasing influence thanks to its close alliance with Azerbaijan.
