5/2/2022,"Calls are increasing for action to tackle what is described as an institutionally sexist atmosphere in parliament, one in which harassment – against both women and men – is alleged to have become endemic. So far, however, there has been little in the way of specific ideas. Here are a few possibilities: Currently, the staff who work directly for MPs are also employed directly by them. The MPs claim expenses and effectively operate as the manager of a small business. While MPs say this gives them control over a complex area of their work, it can greatly complicate staff raising concerns about their own MP, despite the advent of an independent system for complaints. The Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has proposed setting up a “Speaker’s conference” to look into the idea of changing the system so that staff are formally employed by a central body, giving them standardised terms and conditions, and making complaints easier. A number of allegations appear to centre around drunken behaviour in bars on the Westminster estate, notably the Strangers’ Bar, a compact and often tightly packed venue where drinkers spill out on to the Thames-side terrace in warmer weather. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, rejected the idea of bar closures, calling it “excessively puritanical”, a view likely to be shared by many MPs working long hours away from their families. The fact that parliament has several bars and restaurants is often seen as a sign of its cosseted decadence, although the picture is a bit more complex, not least as the estate is campus-sized and tightly guarded, which can make outside excursions lengthy. As well being a workplace, it is also the base for many functions involving outside guests. These were pioneered by Labour before its 1997 election victory, doubling the proportion of female MPs overnight from 9% to 18%, with 101 of them from Labour. The proportion is now a third, with more than half of Labour and Lib Dem MPs being women. While the argument is that more women in the Commons will necessarily dilute any institutional sexism, the Conservatives – over three-quarters of whose MPs are male – have no plans to use any targets or similar measures to change this. The independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS), set up in 2018 following an earlier series of complaints about harassment and abuse, has largely been seen as a success, and offers an anonymous helpline that can trigger investigations. The ICGS has said there were 15 cases started against MPs between July 2020 and June 2021, adding: “We are seeing a similar trend in disclosure so far this year.” However, a review into the scheme after 18 months of its existence raised concerns about equal access for diverse groups and processes that had become “over complex”. This was the charge made by Keir Starmer: that Downing Street has got into the habit of either dismissing claims made against Conservative MPs or seeking to delay any action with lengthy inquiries. “A fish rots from the head,” the Labour leader said on Sunday. Others have argued that Boris Johnson and dozens of other No 10 staff and civil servants being fined for breaking lockdown rules and taking part in reportedly drunken parties hardly sets the best example to others.",News/Politics,What can be done to tackle sexism and harassment in parliament?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/01/sexism-harassment-parliament-westminster-commons-mps
5/2/2022,"Richarlison is facing a Football Association investigation after throwing a flare off the pitch at Goodison Park following his crucial 46th minute winner against Chelsea. The Everton striker launched a blue flare over the Gwladys Street end after it had been thrown on to the pitch during celebrations for a goal that could prove vital for the team’s bid to avoid relegation. No action was taken against the Brazil international by the referee Kevin Friend but the FA is to investigate. A written warning could follow. “We will look into the matter but, as far we we are concerned, Richarlison was attempting to throw it out of the ground,” an Everton spokesperson said. Frank Lampard, who did not see the incident, was full of praise for his match-winner and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who produced a string of superb saves to deny Chelsea in the second half. “I prodded Richy pre-game because he always gives that sort of effort but it has to be directed in the right way, in terms of energy and output to put people under pressure,” the Everton manager said. “When he gets his chances he has to be clinical. For the level of striker he can be, he has to be clinical and he was today. But not just him, Demarai Gray and Anthony Gordon had a lot of leg work to do and they all performed at a massively high level. We never switched off much and, when we did, we had a top class goalkeeper to save us.” Everton remain third from bottom, two points adrift of Leeds and Burnley, but with a game in hand on both relegation rivals. Lampard said: “My feeling is there is a long way to go. We can control our games but we can’t control Burnley and Leeds.” Lampard’s team received a tumultuous reception on arrival at the stadium from thousands of fans who lined Goodison Road to await the team bus. Captain Seamus Coleman admitted: “I’ve been here a long time but I’ve never been in this situation before, and I’ve never felt what I felt coming into the stadium today – the genuine passion, grown men’s faces as they sang ‘Everton’. If that doesn’t stir something in you, you might as well hang up the boots. We did that for them.” Thomas Tuchel, the Chelsea manager, admitted he feared for the team’s Champions League qualification chances following a run of one win in four games. “I said it many weeks ago, I feel never safe and it doesn’t matter if we are in a race for the top one, two, three or four – from the last four games we have four points and that will never be enough,” he said. “At the moment we don’t get points when we play well and we lose when we don’t. It is a bad mixture.”",Sport/Football,FA to investigate Everton’s Richarlison over flare-throwing incident,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/01/fa-to-investigate-evertons-richarlison-over-flare-throwing-incident
5/2/2022,"The tone of the announcement issued over the public address system was apologetic yet proud. Kick-off had been delayed by 15 minutes due to crowd congestion at the turnstiles where an unexpectedly high number of Newcastle United fans were queuing to see the club’s women’s team play at St James’ Park for the first time. By half-time, when the official attendance – an extremely impressive 22,134 – was announced, those club officials who had forecast an audience somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 had fully woken up to the often underestimated pulling power, and immense potential, of women’s football. Given that Becky Langley’s side currently reside in the fourth tier of England’s female pyramid, were facing lowly Alnwick Town Ladies and have just lost their battle with Liverpool Feds for the National League division one north’s sole promotion place, it was a remarkable turnout rewarded by a highly entertaining, decent quality game won 4-0 by Newcastle. Goals from Katie Barker, who was buoyed by a pre-match good luck message from Alan Shearer, the retiring captain Brooke Cochrane, Georgia Gibson and Beth Guy were fully celebrated by the biggest women’s domestic crowd in England this season. “I’ve dreamed of playing here since I was a child,” said Barker. “It was amazing - and a few tears were shed when I scored.” Cochrane had similar emotions. “Overwhelming, unbelievable, phenomenal,” she said. “From now on this team is going to fly. This is just the start.” Well before kick-off the Gallowgate End was already almost as packed as on a Premier League men’s match day and much of the stadium a sea of black and white flags. Granted tickets were priced at a modest £3 but the crowd’s passion spoke volumes. As things finally got under way a giant “Howay The Lasses” banner was unfurled in the Gallowgate and the watching Amanda Staveley would not have been human had she not felt a certain sense of vindication. Newcastle’s co-owner may be a minority shareholder in the Saudi Arabian controlled club but she and her husband, Mehrdad Ghodoussi are responsible for day to day football operations on Tyneside. So far at least they appear to be doing an excellent job. Part of Staveley’s brief has involved ensuring all Newcastle’s staff are paid at least the living wages and offering them access to a decent pension scheme but supporting Langley’s women is another centrepiece of the many welcome changes made since Mike Ashley finally sold the club last October. Next season the women’s squad will start turning fully professional and begin benefiting from some hefty investment. The ambitious plan is to reach the top tier Women’s Super League and qualify for the Champions League within five years. Given that Saudi Arabia is not exactly known for promoting women’s rights that might seem paradoxical but football, like life, is full of paradoxes. Maybe, just maybe, the sight of a female football team bankrolled by the Kingdom’s Public Investment Fund might help augment the efforts of those Saudi modernisers currently striving to enhance women’s freedoms in their part of the Gulf. “I’m so proud of my players as fantastic female role models,” said Langley. “I hope the sight of them playing in front of 22,000 will inspire girls and women everywhere.” Tellingly as the victim of plenty of sexism and, sometimes, downright misogyny, in the City of London during the course of her job as a financier, Staveley understands the wider social importance of promoting women’s sport. Langley, who has been invited to discuss tactics over coffee with Newcastle’s men’s manager, Eddie Howe, who sat alongside Staveley on Sunday, is suitably grateful. She said: “We really appreciate the emotional support, and of course, the investment in the women’s team by the new owners. It’s a special moment in our history and it’s been such a fantastic experience but, even though we had very limited resources before the takeover, I’m still so bitterly disappointed that we’ve just missed out on promotion.” What a shame St James’ Park, so conveniently situated in Newcastle city centre, was not chosen as a venue for this summer’s Women’s European Championship when few would have bet against it being filled to its 52,000 capacity.

5/2/2022,"In Ukraine’s second city, where the barrage of Russian shelling has been among the most relentless endured, hundreds of people stand in line at a post office, waiting to be given chicken and potatoes. As elsewhere in the country, the mundane institutions of civil society of Kharkiv have had to be hastily repurposed for the goal of keeping its population alive, and about 30 such locations across the city have been turned into food aid distribution points. The postal workers at this branch of Nova Poshta, who are being paid by their employer to hand out food instead of post, say that an average of 3,000 people come to their repurposed branch every day, seven days a week. They manage the queues using the post office’s ticket system. “There’s no work. The No 1 thing at the moment is humanitarian aid,” says Ihor Shapovalov, a construction worker who lost his job on 24 February and has just received a quarter of a chicken. “We just want to thank the guys for everything they’re doing.” Kharkiv has been the worst-hit city still under Ukrainian government control. Since the war began two months ago, civilians have died and been injured almost every day as a result of incoming Russian shelling. On Saturday, one person died and five were injured as a result of mortar fire, according to the regional governor. The city is starting to see signs of life, but its economy is in tatters. The vast majority of shops and businesses are still closed. Another man waiting in the queue at the repurposed post office is 30-year-old Zhenia Myrhorod. He says he had tried to get work unloading humanitarian aid at a warehouse, but there was not enough work to go around. “I even collected metal from the missiles but couldn’t find anyone to buy it,” says Myrhorod. “I’m 30 years old. I’ve got legs and arms, but nobody wants them.” The postal workers are helped by local volunteers, who were once queueing themselves and then offered to pitch in. They now have a rota. The volunteers say they are also out of work but, by doing this, they feel they at least get some exercise. A large chunk of Ukraine’s workforce is unofficially employed, as many employers want to avoid tax and pension contributions. As such, they were not eligible for the $250 compensation that the Ukrainian government distributed in March. Yuriy Ponomarenko, a 61-year-old volunteer who unloads the trucks and breaks the frozen chickens up, was a weightlifting trainer before the war. Most of his trainees have left or are fighting. “This is what I was built for,” he says. As the Guardian interviews people in the queue, several say they are nervous about talking to the media in case it attracts an attack. Local police ask us not to identify the number of the postal branch. In late March, six people died and 15 were injured when a rocket hit a queue at another Nova Poschta. Meanwhile, about 1,000 young people in Kharkiv are distributing food door to door to those who are unable to leave their houses, says Oleksandr Getmantsev, who has been active since the first weeks of the war. Alex and his group collect donations mostly from Kharkivans who have fled and want to help those still in the city. Alex and his friend Zoya Zakharova visit around five addresses a day of people who reach them through word of mouth. Many of those they visit are pensioners who have money in their accounts but cannot walk to the few functioning post offices to retrieve it. Others, like his mother, live in northern Kharkiv, which is under constant bombardment. People in the worst affected areas on the edges of the city have nowhere to buy food and often no means to cook it because gas and electricity have been cut off. Many of them are living in basements and only come out to cook on makeshift barbecues outside. “My mother doesn’t want to leave her home. I’m not sure what it would take for her to leave – they are bombed constantly,” says Alex with a laugh, adding that he visits her about once a week on his rounds. “I guess she’s got used to it.” At least two international organisations have recently started work in the city, but Alex says it is difficult to evaluate the impact they are having on the ground as they have not been visible. The last time the Guardian visited Kharkiv in late March, the city’s governor said that international organisations were sending large quantities of aid but were not on the ground. One woman, Viktoria Anatolivna, is 32 weeks pregnant with twins and alone with her six-year-old son, Danylo. She says they have only been outside four times since the war started because of the shelling. She wraps Danylo in duvets in the bathtub with the cat when the shelling starts, and takes the floor in their corridor for herself. “I’ve run out of money and all my relatives have left,” she says. She relies on the volunteers, and some soldiers who also bring them food. Anatolivna gave birth to Danylo at the maternity hospital near their house but will have her twins in a hospital in the centre. The maternity clinic next to her house is overseeing births in the basement because of the shelling, and it would be an extra risk with a twin birth. The last stop on the food donations route is Nadia Chaikovska, a 70-year-old woman who now takes care of more than 20 cats who were abandoned by fleeing neighbours. Alex and Zoya bring her sacks of cat food. “I’ve already buried five that I’ve found lying around,” says Chaikovska. “I just love animals. These cats are sterilised; some of them are pedigrees. They can’t survive on their own.”",News/World news,"‘I collected metal from the missiles in Kharkiv, but couldn’t find anyone to buy it’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/i-collected-metal-from-the-missiles-in-kharkiv-but-couldnt-find-anyone-to-buy-it
5/2/2022,"The imprisonment in a London jail of tennis legend Boris Becker for bankruptcy offences has triggered an outpouring of shock and disappointment in his native Germany, where he was once hailed as a national hero. One former fan spoke for many when he said: “He made mistakes for which he’s rightly being punished. But maybe he’ll get up again one day, just like Becker, the tennis player, so often did.” The writer, Till Jecke, a sports reporter with the tabloid Bild, offered one of many recollections in Sunday’s newspapers of the day in July 1985, when the 17-year-old German became the youngest person to win Wimbledon and “catapulted the somewhat stuffy ‘white sport’ into sheer galactic heights”. ‘Boom boom Becker,’ as he was nicknamed at home for the way he pounded the court, captured hearts in Germany and across the world. His ‘Becker fist’ and the ‘Becker pike’, when he’d hurl himself horizontally across the court in an effort to get every ball, were all part of the unforgettable magic mix of his play, Jecke said. Such a contrast, then, was the scene in Southwark Crown Court on Friday, when the 54-year-old was sentenced to two-and-a-half years for hiding millions of pounds’ worth of assets after being made bankrupt in June 2017. “What now awaits him is brutal,” wrote Stefanie Bolzen, London correspondent of Die Welt. She had watched as Becker, dressed in a tie in the Wimbledon colours of purple and green, was “whisked from the dock and into the security wing – no last embrace, no chance to be comforted”. The treatment of a convicted man in the UK is considerably harsher than in Germany, she and several German commentators have pointed out. Becker was taken at speed in a white high-security van to Wandsworth prison – poignantly just 4km from Centre Court at Wimbledon, scene of his greatest performance, German media reported live at the scene. He had clutched his belongings in an olive sports bag that according to Bild – which had a team of reporters on the story trailing him over the past weeks of the trial – he had bought in Harrods the previous day. Newspapers showed superimposed images of him against the backdrop of the gloomy Victorian prison, showing a typical cell. They pored over the details, from the nickname of Wandsworth as ‘screws jail’ to previous inmates – Oscar Wilde, Julian Assange – and the visiting times; just one visitor allowed a week, with whom no physical contact is allowed. There are courses in yoga, embroidery and hairdressing, Bild said, and even a gym, but the food, according to a lawyer whose clients had been imprisoned there, “is like mush”. There is very little sympathy in Germany for Becker, a man seen to have brought his problems on himself after he was found guilty of hiding millions of pounds worth of assets. “He could have averted this tragedy,” Der Spiegel said, “but he was not prepared to show any real remorse, or humility towards his creditors … at the very least he should have shown that he had learned from his mistakes.” Yet commiserations over the sportsman’s fall from grace were in plentiful supply. “For the human being Boris, I’m sorry,” the former football manager Reiner Calmund said. Günther Bosch, who trained him to Wimbledon victory, said he hoped his former protege would “use the strength with which he survived the hardest of matches, in order to master what he now faces.” But the 85-year-old said he thought he “could not bear the idea” of visiting him in prison. The German tennis federation, DTB, said it will “stand by” the three-times Wimbledon champion. “We respect and regret the judgment and wish him all the best for the coming time,” Dietloff von Arnim, its president, said. “We will stand by his side.” His estranged wife, Lilly Becker, told the German channel RTL she was surprised by what she called the severity of the judgment - he had received just a suspended sentence in Germany in 2002 for tax evasion. “After all, he didn’t kill anybody,” she said. She added that it was important for the world to know that she, their joint son, Amadeus, Noah and Elias and Barbara, the children and their mother from his first marriage, as well as his current girlfriend Liliana, “all stand behind Boris”. His mother, 86-year-old Elvira Pisch, said she was upset and surprised. “After all,” she said, “he is a decent boy”. Anna Ermakova, his daughter from a brief but infamous sexual encounter with her waitress mother Angela in the cupboard of a London restaurant in 1999, said she was in a “state of shock”. She had written to the judge on behalf of her 12-year-old half-brother Amadeus, who she said would now be “without a father figure… during a difficult phase of his growing up”. Roberto Blanco, the singer, and an erstwhile friend, said: “From a human point of view I’m incredibly sorry … not least because on the court he gave us all some really special moments.” The fashion designer Harald Glööckler said: “Boris Becker was everyone’s idol. Regardless of whether you had anything to do with tennis or not, everyone was touched by him. He was once well and truly praised to the skies – and now he’s crashed from the heights.” Oscar Otte, who reached the semi-finals of the ATP tournament in Munich on Friday, said he was saddened by Becker’s conviction “because he is the tennis legend in Germany and he made ‘tennis Germany’ what it is today thanks to his achievements.",News/UK news,‘He hasn’t killed anyone’: Germans react to Boris Becker’s imprisonment,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/01/he-hasnt-killed-anyone-germans-commiserate-boris-beckers-imprisonment
5/2/2022,"Two goals from central defenders, both following corners, and an overall performance that did not convince. Mikel Arteta did not care. To the Arsenal manager, it was not about how the victory came or in what kind of style. It was only about the result. Arsenal could feel the pressure, with Tottenham having beaten Leicester earlier in the day to jump above them into fourth place – also known as the Promised Land. Arteta’s team had to react and they did so, keeping the dream burning of a first Champions League qualification since 2016. Rob Holding, in for the injured Ben White, had not scored since September 2019 but he did so when he capitalised on loose West Ham marking on a Bukayo Saka delivery to make it 1-0. With one eye, understandably, on Thursday’s Europa League semi-final return at Eintracht Frankfurt, David Moyes had mixed and matched with his lineup, starting Tomas Soucek and Michail Antonio among the substitutes and the West Ham manager might feel that they were missed on defensive set-pieces. He was also without three of his key centre-halves. Jarrod Bowen got an equaliser that was merited on the balance of the first half but the game turned when West Ham could not defend the second phase of another Saka corner. When Gabriel Martinelli crossed, Gabriel Magalhães was all alone to power home his header. According to the Arsenal support, Arteta knows exactly what they need. What he did not want was an injury to Takehiro Tomiyasu, the right-back, who had started for the first time since 20 January. But for the manager, the smooth outweighed the rough. The history was on Arsenal’s side – they had lost only two of the previous 27 league games against West Ham, winning 20 – but it was all about how they imposed themselves here. It was an opportunity that they could not allow to slip. How much did West Ham really want this? Eintracht had to be on their minds. Moyes asked Aaron Cresswell to play on the left of a central defensive two, with Ryan Fredericks away from his preferred flank at left-back and Bowen filling in up front. It was plain that Arsenal’s need was greater but they made one of those slow starts that so frustrate Arteta; the movement telegraphed, the basic oomph missing. Arsenal did little until the 38th minute. That was when Bowen gave away the ball and Martin Ødegaard released Eddie Nketiah, who sliced left to right, into a large seam of space. His low shot forced Lukasz Fabianski to tip behind, although it might have been more precise. Arsenal did not mind because, moments later, they were in front. It was strange to see Holding up against Maunel Lanzini on the corner from Saka. He duly brushed him aside and, when he rose, there was nobody close enough in claret and blue. The header was glanced into the bottom corner. West Ham had been a little more proactive up until then. Kurt Zouma had a header blocked while Lanzini saw Holding throw himself in front of a shot after Vladimir Coufal’s cross had taken a slight deflection. Declan Rice also side-footed weakly at Aaron Ramsdale. West Ham were deservedly level at half-time. Ramsdale had needed to throw up a hand to keep out Rice’s near-post flick from a Pablo Fornals corner and the equaliser followed a raking pass from Rice out to Coufal, who cut back for Bowen. The striker’s first touch set up the shot and the technique on it was excellent, conjuring power, the ball flicking off Gabriel and beating Ramsdale inside the far corner. West Ham felt that Ramsdale got away with one on 53 minutes when he tore out of his area and threw himself into a high challenge on Bowen, who had chased a ball forward. Ramsdale unbalanced Bowen, who went down but Mike Dean saw that there was no contact. Even if there was, it would probably have only added up to a yellow card. Saka, as ever, rarely wasted the ball, always choosing the correct option. He thought that he had put his team back in front, jinking inside and unloading low for the near corner, only for Fabianski to turn behind. But Arsenal did score from the corner, taken by Saka, West Ham again caving uncharacteristically. Up went a posse of bodies and, when the ball ran through to the far side, Gabriel Martinelli returned it towards the back post. No West Ham player went out to Martinelli and, even worse, nobody tracked the run of Gabriel, with Lanzini especially culpable. The header was too powerful for Fabianski. West Ham had nothing left and they were fortunate that Nketiah did not add to the scoreline from one of three presentable openings.",Sport/Football,Gabriel and Holding on target as Arsenal win at West Ham to stay in fourth place,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/01/west-ham-arsenal-premier-league-match-report
5/2/2022,"They are not exactly expansion bedfellows, and certainly not friends. But Macarthur FC and Western United bear striking similarities – and not just because they are expansion clubs. The very nature of the both their births, selected by then-Football Federation Australia to join A-League Men in 2018, means comparisons are inevitable. Off the field, both United and the Bulls have quickly become two of the most universally derided clubs in all of Australian football, the mere mention of their names almost certain to attract cantankerous commentators with grievances to air. Alas, unlike the likes of Melbourne Victory or Sydney FC, this is not born of a disdain derived from envy of trophies or from long-standing historical grievances – marketable hatred – but, instead, their very nature of existence. United’s detractors frequently round more on their failure to deliver the stadium they promised during the expansion, whereas the Bulls come under fire for ticket prices and an inability to fashion and invest in a sustainable strategy to connect with potential supporters in Sydney’s booming southwest. Given these things were at the core of their expansion bids, however, this betrays the metaphysical angst which exists at the core of their disdain. The clubs are scorned because of what they are perceived to represent. They are adjudged as entities hoisted upon the league by a former broadcaster hungry for more Sydney and Melbourne teams and a federation, desperate for the fattest licence fees on offer. This carries with it its own level of animus – and that is not exactly wrong, if lacking in a bit of nuance – though early missteps in communication and approach have not exactly helped undercut these negative first impressions. Yet even ignoring existing discussions on being dark twins of the expansion process, both have also charted eerily similar on-field paths since their birth. Under former NSL stars and A-League foundation players Mark Rudan and Ante Miličić, they overcame the Covid-19 challenges affecting their first season in the league to reach the ALM semi-finals, only to lose to Melbourne City. Both lost high-profile Mediterranean marquees ahead of their second season – Panagiotis Kone from Western and Beñat Etxebarria for Macarthur – but still continued to invest heavily in their squads with the hope of going one better in their second year. But maddeningly for those within the club’s inner sanctums, results failed to flow from this largess in their sophomore campaigns;. United collapsed during 2020-21’s home stretch to finish 10th and Macarthur are officially out of the 2021-22 play-offs. And now, with Miličić’s mid-week announcement that he is set to step down from the Bulls job, both clubs’ foundation coaches will also have lasted two seasons before they moved on. Looking ahead, though, should the strange parallels between the two sides continue, this does not necessarily have to spell disaster for Macarthur. In 2021-22 – their third campaign in the ALM – United are locked into a top-three spot and still have their second-place destiny in their hands. With among the highest – if not the highest – wage bills in the league and an internal pre-season expectation of a top-two finish, it is not exactly a quintessential underdog tale but, alongside Victory’s reinvigoration, a demonstration of how quickly fortunes can turn. United’s foibles when they are forced to serve as the active team in possession have become an obvious trend this season. But from a pragmatist’s standpoint, first-year coach John Aloisi has not been tasked with building a team to beat Manchester City or Real Madrid, but a team to win the ALM. After being consigned to the coaching scrap heap, his side remain alive in the race for the premiership with two games remaining. In the long run, this will all prove meaningless unless the club can sort itself out off the field, namely deliver on promises of infrastructure and supercharge efforts to endear themselves to Victoria’s west. The same goes for Macarthur as they seek out a replacement for Miličić, an upswing in results and the challenge of establishing what it actually means to be Macarthur FC. But it is invariably easier to fashion an identity when you are winning. And while these parallels do not mean the Bulls should rush out and appoint Ross Aloisi, their expansion companions have demonstrated that Miličić’s departure does not have to consign them to on-field misery in 2022-23.",Sport/Football,Macarthur FC and Western United have charted eerily similar A-League Men paths,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/02/macarthur-fc-and-western-united-have-charted-eerily-similar-a-league-men-paths
5/2/2022,"Aleading Australian climate scientist says the national science agency, CSIRO, has been turned into a “very extravagant consulting company” under the Coalition, with its scientists barred from speaking publicly about government policy. The warning from Prof David Karoly follows his retirement from the Commonwealth Science and Industry Research Organisation in February after more than 40 years as one of the most respected voices in climate science. Karoly, who worked on four of the six major assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, returned to CSIRO in 2018. He agreed to head its Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub in the wake of the chief executive, Larry Marshall, making deep cuts to the organisation’s climate science capacity on the grounds the problem was “proven”. That push was partially reversed after public and political pressure, with Marshall later acknowledging it had been a mistake. Karoly signed on to help build a new program. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Karoly says he knew the job would be challenging, and some people “questioned my sanity” for taking it on. He says he found budget cuts and changes in management had transformed CSIRO from a body focused on public good science into one reliant on external contracts to survive. While he is proud he helped secure an effective 50% funding increase to be spent on a new climate systems hub, he says the cuts had been “stupid” and had a lasting impact. He says staff in CSIRO’s oceans and atmosphere unit were last year told 70% of CSIRO funding now had to come from external earnings – contracts with industry and government agencies – rather than core funding for a project to be approved. Historically, there had been about 30% external funding. Karoly argues it has fundamentally changed an organisation that was once known for its international-standard “public good” science. Famously, CSIRO radio astronomers accidentally invented what became wi-fi while doing unrelated public good research. Karoly says that sort of work is now less likely. “CSIRO’s approach is now to make money,” he says. “It’s essentially a very extravagant consulting company, and unless it has large enough external earnings science doesn’t go ahead. It means public good science has disappeared from CSIRO unless someone else is willing to pay for it.” He says focus on “customer-driven science” is not limited to the federal Coalition, but it had accelerated the shift. “It’s not just a Liberal National party government perspective, it’s also a Labor party perspective: that the users should drive the science to answer the questions that are important for them,” he says. Karoly says scientists at CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology are routinely blocked from speaking publicly and have their work suppressed if it could be interpreted as at odds with government policy. As one of CSIRO’s top climate scientists, Karoly was allowed to talk about global greenhouse gas emissions and the urgent need to reduce them, but not allowed to talk about Australia’s approach to the issue or performance in cutting emissions. “We were not allowed to talk about Australian government policy on anything, whether it was Australian government policy on Covid, or Australian government policy on seasonal climate forecasts, or Australian government policy on emissions,” he says. He says the suppression had “certainly got worse in the last decade” under the Coalition. “Part of that has been to do with CSIRO’s nervousness about funding. I think that explains why the CSIRO chief executive did not want to focus on climate change, and was willing at that point to say ‘we know enough about climate change science and we can reduce staff numbers by 50%’,” he says. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Karoly was not always deemed to have stayed within CSIRO guidelines on what he could publicly say. In late 2020, a peer-reviewed scientific paper documented claims by Australian scientists that their evidence and advice on the impact of logging, forest destruction and mining had been suppressed in a variety of ways. Karoly posted a comment in response to a piece on the issue published by The Conversation, thanking the authors for “shining a spotlight on the key issue” and pointing out commenting on science issues was restricted for public service employees. “This is not news for climate scientists, particularly those in the Bureau of Meteorology and in CSIRO, and has a long and interesting history,” he wrote. He says within 24 hours he had a phone call from his manager at CSIRO relaying a message from the organisation’s executive that he had breached the organisation’s public comment policy by commenting on something he didn’t have expertise in. “It was a classical catch-22. They suppressed my commenting on a paper that said there was suppression of science,” Karoly says. “I think it was absolutely stupid but, yes, what CSIRO was trying to do was to suppress science. It makes no sense that we have some of the country’s best climate scientists in the Bureau of Meteorology and in the CSIRO and they can’t talk openly about the links between science and public policy.” A CSIRO spokesperson says scientists are “actively encouraged” to communicate their scientific work to government, industry and the community, but to remain a trusted independent and bipartisan advisor to government the organisation needs to remain impartial. “We therefore ask that our people do not advocate, defend or publicly canvass the merits of government or opposition policies,” the spokeperson says. On funding, the spokesperson says the CSIRO has “a variety of funding arrangements in place, depending on the nature of the research”, that each year about 35-40% of the money invested in research came from external revenue sources and that ratio had been consistent “for many years”. They did not respond directly to Karoly saying the oceans and atmosphere unit had been told that would be lifted to 70%. Some of CSIRO’s external funding comes from fossil fuel companies. The organisation says on its website it is “developing more efficient and sustainable fossil fuel technologies and helping industry to safely access and extract Australia’s rich resources, including oil, gas and coal”.

His return to commenting on government policy began last month. In the foreword of a Climate Council report on the Coalition’s failure to deal with the climate crisis, Karoly drew a sharp contrast between the major parties. He wrote that a decade ago under a minority Labor government the country had clear plans to deal with the climate crisis, including an emissions trading scheme, and was joining with others in the global community in recognising that much stronger action was needed to “avoid the unmanageable and to manage the unavoidable”. He was appointed as an inaugural member of the Climate Change Authority, which was created to advise government on policy, during this time. He said the Coalition had abolished the carbon pricing scheme despite evidence it was working, ignored advice on climate targets, closed a 27-year-old climate science program, cut funding for research and appointed its supporters to climate advisory roles. “The Liberal National government, throughout its time in office, has been making choices that make global warming worse. And that has been to the great detriment of our country,” he wrote. Karoly’s career was honoured at a retirement symposium as he left CSIRO. Former colleagues praised not only his contribution to scientific knowledge, but his support for early-career scientists, particularly women, and desire to push boundaries to improve science communication. Freed from CSIRO, he says he now sees building public understanding as the most vital part of his work. “I would describe it as building climate literacy or climate understanding,” he says. “Maybe that is advocacy, but it’s not just speaking publicly it’s also working in the business sector and with local government and across a whole range of community groups and organisations about the urgency of action on climate change. “That, in my view, is where the rubber hits the road. We can only have a concerted, coordinated government action if enough people understand why it’s important to them, important to the community, important to the world and important to the environment. Working on that is what I see is now my most important legacy.”",News/Australia news,"CSIRO has become ‘extravagant consulting company’, one of its former top climate scientists says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/02/csiro-has-become-extravagant-consulting-company-one-of-its-former-top-climate-scientist-says
5/2/2022,"An area of heritage-listed bushland that formed part of the environmental offset for the western Sydney airport has been bulldozed for a car park at a new defence facility. The clearing was revealed in an independent audit of the federal government’s progress in delivering the offsets required to compensate for the destruction of endangered habitat for the new travel hub in Badgerys Creek. The main offset for the clearing of critically endangered Cumberland plain woodland is about 900ha of bushland at a defence site in the suburb of Orchard Hills. The site, known as Defence Establishment Orchard Hills, is an explosives storage and training facility that is listed on the commonwealth heritage register because it is almost entirely vegetated with endangered woodlands. Federal environment department officials had already questioned the credibility of offsetting habitat destruction for the airport with heritage-listed land the government already owned. Now, the most recent offset delivery report produced for the federal infrastructure department reveals a small section of the heritage bushland was cleared for a car park for a new naval guided weapons facility at the Orchard Hills site. Conservationists have raised concerns about the clearing, with the Australian Conservation Foundation describing it as “yet another disturbing example that underlines the fundamental flaws in our national environment law”. “The offsetting system facilitates the steady decline of areas of unique ecological significance,” Sophie Power, the ACF’s national biodiversity policy adviser, said. “For offsets to be credible they must provide genuine, additional, permanent protection and restoration.” The clearing was identified by an independent reviewer who audited the Orchard Hills offset. Under the development conditions, the infrastructure department must file annual reports on its progress in delivering the environmental offsets. The reports are years behind, with the 2020 review only recently published. The independent review is attached as an appendix and notes that inspection of the site had found a recently cleared construction compound and temporary development within bushland that had been mapped as poor condition Cumberland plain woodland. The reviewer wrote that the cleared area would have to be removed from the offset because it was unlikely to recover “without substantial restoration efforts”. They also recommended that an investigation be launched into how development came to occur within the offset, to ensure it did not happen again. Lisa Harrold is the president of the Mulgoa Valley Landcare group and was a member of an expert group that provided advice to the infrastructure department when it was preparing the offset plan. Harrold has been vocal about her disappointment in the decision to use Orchard Hills as the main offset when it was already on the heritage register and had been promised as a permanent conservation site by both major political parties as far back as 2007. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The fact of the matter is they’ve shown complete and utter disregard for the entire offsetting process,” she said. “If it wasn’t for community members like myself who dig through reports and find they’ve cleared part of the offset there would be no recourse. “What we’re left with is one government department telling another oh, sorry, we mucked up.” The defence department did not respond to questions about the development, or whether it sought environmental approval to clear within the heritage area. The environment department, after receiving questions from Guardian Australia, said it was making “preliminary enquiries, consistent with our published compliance policy”. A spokesperson for the infrastructure department said the construction identified by the independent auditor was in the “vicinity of the offset site’s preliminary boundary”. “The department was aware that this boundary was subject to change once the final footprint of the defence facility was known and subsequent changes to the boundary have increased the size of the offset,” they said. The spokesperson said the department had robust monitoring systems in place for the airport offsets and work on the next annual report was under way. But Tim Beshara, the manager of policy and strategy at the Wilderness Society, said the story of the Cumberland plain woodland’s decline to the brink of extinction was a “farce” that highlighted layers of failure in administration of Australia’s environmental laws. He said the bushland at Orchard Hills was the best remaining example of the woodland, and its listing on the heritage register meant governments were obliged to manage and protect it. “And now it has been supposedly ‘secured’ as an offset for other destruction elsewhere, but somehow no one seems to check when the bulldozers arrive,” he said. “There isn’t a single obligation to protect the Cumberland Plain that the commonwealth haven’t dodged or failed … and yet no one seems to be accountable.”",News/Environment,Bushland marked as environmental offset for new Sydney airport bulldozed for car park,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/02/bushland-marked-as-environmental-offset-for-new-sydney-airport-bulldozed-for-car-park
5/2/2022,"On Easter Monday, the general consensus seemed to be that football was stuffed. Halfway through the third quarter of the Hawthorn-Geelong clash, the gentleman in front of me announced to the entire bay that he was going home. Ripples of applause broke out, for he had been an insufferable twit all afternoon. Hell, if an absurd 50m penalty was the price we had to pay for ridding him from our lives, so be it. The Easter round had been a mix of the piddling, the bewildering and the infuriating. The crackdown on dissent meant the game was suddenly bogged down in the most pettifogging details. What angle were the player’s arms at? Did his facial expression hint at belligerence? Was there a curse word? It was grade 6 stuff. The old legends on the panel shows were bursting out of their Calibre shirts. Many still believe that the field is theirs – that umpires should get out of the way, know their place, and cop the criticism. Graham Cornes said it was “un-Australian”. His son said it was like bringing a rocket launcher to a water pistol fight. But a fortnight on, something remarkable has happened. The world hasn’t ended. The players, on the main, have adjusted. Senior umpires say their job has never been easier, or more enjoyable. The football has been excellent. The penalties for dissent have been negligible, and mostly reasonable. When it comes to the AFL’s motives, it pays to be cynical. In a stadium sponsored by a superhero franchise, looking slightly more combative than usual, Brad Scott read from a prepared statement. “It’s incumbent upon us at the elite level to set the standards of behaviour for all levels of the game,” he said. Now that’s all well and good. But what sort of standard is the AFL itself setting? Grassroots football doesn’t seem to be at the forefront of their thinking when they’re spruiking betting odds, flogging junk food, letting Tasmanian football rot, or paying themselves obscene bonuses. Before Covid hit, they were drowning in money. Instead of splashing cash on sexy scoreboards, Super Bowl junkets and infantile pre-season competitions, they could have invested in the core fabric of the game. They could have nurtured and protected the young umpires coming through the ranks. Instead, they treated them as mere appendages to the game. In suburban, country, and junior football, the worst offenders are often spectators and parents. Some of the most vile abuse is at the under-11 and under-12 level. You sometimes see signs: “These are kids. The Umpires are human. This is not the AFL”. Why a grown adult feels the need to belittle a teenager who’s probably being paid 20 or 30 bucks to officiate is beyond me. There are some very angry, dim-witted people out there. You see them in traffic jams and protest rallies. They vote. They post online. They procreate. They like footy. They drive umpires away. They’ve certainly spooked the AFL. When Scott announced his crackdown, the assumption was that players were being thrown under the bus. Jacqui Lounder, a sports psychologist who has worked with several AFL clubs and dirt bike riders, said it’s impossible for the vast majority of elite sportspeople to restrain themselves. She said the part of the brain that regulates emotions, the amygdala, makes it impossible for athletes to hold back under stress. She was interviewed by Mark Robinson, an occasionally emotional man himself, who wrote an article on umpire dissent that began thus: “It is said the truth is always the first casualty of war. In footy, it seems common sense is almost always the first casualty of everything.” But the vast majority of players have adjusted. Some of the best footballers of their generation – Martin, Pendlebury, Bontempelli and Gawn – are not the type of athletes to waste energy. They have done their bit. Now the AFL has to invest properly in its umpires. It has to pay them properly, train them properly, and not over-complicate their job. The umpires themselves have to be adults about this. The sport has evolved, and been manipulated, to the point where it’s nearly impossible to adjudicate. But they have to resist the urge to impose themselves on every contest. The wider footballing public, including fans, pundits and parents, perhaps have the most difficult adjustment to make. A basic grasp of the rules is a good starting point. Not throwing a tantrum every time an umpire makes a mistake helps too. I’m as guilty of this as anyone. To take the most superficial of stabs, the older you are, the harder it is to come to terms with this. It is particularly hard for any fan over the age of 40, for whom mouthing off at the umpire has been part and parcel of being a supporter. It’s hard. It’s frustrating. At times, the dissent rule is a complete train-wreck. At times, it sucks every morsel of spontaneity and individuality out of the game. But in just two weeks, there’s been a correction from umpires. There’s been a total buy-in from players. There’s mounting evidence that this rule is working, and essential to the overall health of the game.",Sport/Sport,AFL’s crackdown on umpire dissent is not the end of football as we know it | Jonathan Horn,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/02/afls-crackdown-on-umpire-dissent-is-not-the-end-of-football-as-we-know-it
5/2/2022,"With all the forecasting nous reputed to reside inside their HQ in Sydney’s Martin Place, you’d think the Reserve Bank’s intel gatherers should have seen this coming. It’s been clear for months an inflation data dump would land smack in the middle of an election campaign. Nor could the RBA’s scouts have missed the LED-lit fuel prices and exploding supermarket bills warning that the March CPI would be a big one. And yet – much like the government’s failure to heed and head off China’s security pact with our erstwhile pals in Solomon Islands – the RBA this week finds itself in a strategic and political bind: lift the cash rate at Tuesday’s monthly board meeting to counter the highest inflation in more than 20 years, or wait until after the election? Credibility is at stake. Just as Scott Morrison labelled any new Chinese base in Solomon Islands as a “red line” for Australia – dismissed as “ridiculous” in Beijing – the RBA chief, Phil Lowe, has repeatedly stated he wanted to see both inflation trends and an acceleration of the decade-long feeble wage growth before pulling the rate rise trigger. We don’t get the latter figures until 18 May when the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases the wage price index. But as Saul Eslake, a high-profile independent economist, reckons: “That data may well show that there hasn’t been a significant pick-up in wages growth.” But the breadth of inflationary pressures now being experienced across the Australian economy “puts the RBA in a position where its credibility would be at serious risk if it doesn’t raise rates [this] week”, Eslake says. “If it doesn’t raise rates, [the RBA] leaves itself wide open to the suggestion that the only reason it hasn’t raised rates is because of the imminence of the federal election.” John Howard’s bid to win a fourth re-election was famously dented by a rate rise in late 2007. Another mid-campaign rate hike would damage Morrison’s claims – already hurt by the 5.1% CPI number – that the Coalition is a better economic manager than Labor, just 18 days before polls close. Chatter in Canberra is that RBA boffins are confused about which way to go. Most market economists have predicted a case rate rise this week from a record low 0.1% to 0.25% although the CBA – Australia’s biggest mortgage lender – demurs. Gareth Aird, CBA’s economics head, says while the inflation spurt might well warrant a rate rise, Lowe has yet to signal a change of policy – as has become the norm for twitchy central bankers. Instead the RBA had stressed for two years the importance of seeing higher wages. It would be “a blow to their credibility” for the RBA to lift rates before seeing the WPI. “They would have basically reneged on what they said just two weeks ago [with the release of the April board meeting’s minutes],” Aird says. Alan Oster, Aird’s counterpart at NAB, takes the opposite view. The RBA has more reputation to shed if it delayed dealing with an inflationary threat that had become increasingly evident at home and abroad, even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “I think it might actually help their credibility a little bit because, let’s face it, it’s pretty shot as it already is,” Oster says, reeling off a list including last October’s bungled exit of rate-suppression efforts that rattled bond markets. “Their forecasts for wages, prices, what they would do, what they wouldn’t do – they’re all changed,” he says, with an obvious misfire being the RBA’s view of when rate rises would resume. “Six months ago, they were saying it wasn’t until 2024.” He says: “They might get a little bit more credit if they actually say, ‘Stuff it, things have changed. We need to move.’” ASX futures market shows investors predict the RBA's cash rate will be at 2.5% by the end of 2022, whether or not the central bank makes its first move on 3 May. #ausvotes #auspol pic.twitter.com/B2O25E5vm9 Timo Henckel, a senior lecturer at the Australian National University’s research school of economics, says the RBA “boxed themselves into a corner”. Until recently, it had talked up how inflation had been very low and the need to stoke at least moderate inflationary expectations. Breaking a promise to keep interest rates down for three years to aid the economy through the pandemic two years in hadn’t helped the bank’s standing either. Henckel, a member of a shadow RBA board that tries to anticipate the bank’s moves, says he remains “50-50” as to whether Lowe will cross his red line and raise rates before receiving the official wages data. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Even so, “I’m just not convinced that the wage number is really going to provide that much additional information,” Henckel says. “What would the wage number have to be for them to decide not to raise it in June?” Henckel says it’s “a funny view” that a rate rise next week would be a political act given that holding off a month enhances risks that inflation will get out of control and require more drastic rate rises later to rein it in. “There’s no such thing as neutrality and monetary policy,” he says. “Even if you don’t change interest rates, that’s taking a stand, right?”",News/Australia news,Will the RBA lift the cash rate this week to counter inflation – or wait until after the election?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/02/will-the-rba-lift-the-cash-rate-this-week-to-counter-inflation-or-wait-until-after-the-election
5/2/2022,"Memoir, Ultimo Press, $32.99 Janine Mikosza presents her extraordinary memoir about surviving childhood trauma as a conversation between two grown-up versions of herself: Janine, the author, trying gently but doggedly to probe for painful details; and “Nin”, the subject, whose trauma is still so raw that it muddles her memory and tenses – and occasionally shuts her down entirely. As heavy as it sounds, the pair make wonderful company – insightful, warm, funny – as they revisit the 14 houses Janine lived in before she turned 18. In some she can only remember the bedrooms and bathrooms; others she can’t set foot in at all. Perhaps all memoir writing necessitates a personality split, as the author tries to wrestle the subject down. That split is made literal here, in a heartbreakingly honest rendering of both the process and the story. – Steph Harmon Non-fiction/memoir, Simon & Schuster, $34.99 In children’s literature, absent parents abound. They’re away at war, they’ve gone to work while the kids run amok, or they’ve died, leaving orphans to be sent to the country, or to live with aunt Polly, or to become wizards. But what lessons hide in the ages of literature to prepare children for the reality of death? This was a driving question for author Chloe Hooper upon discovering her partner and father of two young sons, Don Watson, had a rare and aggressive illness. Her resulting book is an exquisite work in which her prodigious talent for getting to the true heart of a story is turned inwards. Hooper invites the reader into her home, heart, and head, to sit by her children’s beds, but carefully, gracefully. She staves off easy mawkishness and strikes a perfect balance – with mood-perfect illustrations by Anna Walker – as she searches for a way to tell her children about the likely tragedy that awaits. While it’s a deeply personal dilemma, Hooper finds universality in a magical and compelling book. – Lucy Clark Novel, Penguin Random House, $32.99 Australian author Toltz, best known for his Booker-nominated debut doorstopper, A Fraction of the Whole, is a Vegemite writer: you either really don’t enjoy him or think he’s delicious on toast. His third novel, Here Goes Nothing, is perhaps the clearest demonstration of Toltz’s skills as a humorist: from the opener we know our narrator, Angus Mooney, is dead, trapped in a bureaucratic afterlife making umbrellas in order to fund trips back to this Earthly plane to haunt his former home, where his pregnant wife and the man who murdered him still live. You can tell the author is having great fun – the word-play, aphorisms and gags can feel almost relentless at times – and some readers will have great fun with this too. – Sian Cain Novel, Allen and Unwin, $29.99 It’s difficult to describe Sunbathing without making it sound like literary cliche: “Young woman recovers in European countryside.” Perhaps it’s the catalyst that makes this debut so moving: the narrator’s father succumbs to a depression, and she blames herself. Or perhaps it’s the authenticity: Beech knows exactly the complex swirl of grief, anger and dissociation that follow a loss to suicide, which she poured into a Google Doc in real time back when it happened to her. The narrator has been invited to the scenic mountains of Abruzzo for a month to help two friends prepare for their wedding, and the days go by in a sweet, healing, pastoral blur: long walks, small vegetables, Italian wine, all wrapped in the hermetic warmth of close friends sharing their life and love with a third. After two years without travel, it’s a wonderful place to spend time. – Steph Harmon Non-fiction, Allen and Unwin, $32.99 Pinkerton spent six years travelling around Australia, interviewing millennials and Gen Zers about their dating habits and sex lives. To her credit, Heartland does venture into territory that feels relatively uncharted: the love lives of trans Indigenous Australian “sistagirls”, asexual partnerships, and stealthing (secretly removing a condom during sex), for instance. Pinkerton, a Gen Xer who admits to having had a sheltered life when it comes to dating and sex, is a curious writer, and remains so even when she shares her own biases and fears. But some of what Pinkerton covers as modern phenomena, like kink parties and polyamory, will not seem all that new or noteworthy, regardless of when the reader was born – and any attempt to make conclusions about an entire generation is bound to feel unconvincing. As a millennial, I did not see myself in this book about millennials, nor did I feel it was written for readers my age – but Heartland remains undeniably interesting. – Sian Cain Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Poetry, UQP, $24.99 Sarah Holland-Batt is one of Australia’s most respected poets, whose second collection, the Hazards, won her the Prime Minister’s Literary award for poetry in 2016. To others though, her voice will be forever tied to her fearless aged care advocacy, which began when she testified at the 2019 royal commission with a harrowing story about her father, who she says experienced horrifying neglect, dehumanisation and victimisation at the aged care facility he lived at in Brisbane for five years, until his death in 2020. The Jaguar, her third collection, is a confronting and heartfelt elegy for her father, bookended by the devastating end of his life but not forgoing the vivid living of the rest of it – capturing his humanity, his illness and her loss with clarity and love. – Steph Harmon Memoir, Text Publishing, $34.99 Chronicling her family’s journey from Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya to a new life in Melbourne for the past 17 years, South Sudanese refugee Akuch Kuol Anyieth’s memoir is an engagingly written and insightful story of love and trauma. Unflinching in its honesty about abuse within her own family, Anyieth’s book advocates for greater understanding of the mental anguish suffered by refugees who have faced war, while examining her own experiences of racism in Australia. She dissects negative media portrayals of young African men who have been “over policed”, while critiquing traditional South Sudanese ways of parenting she suggests may contribute to family breakdown. – Steve Dow",Arts/Books,"‘Exquisite’, ‘extraordinary’, ‘insightful’: the best Australian books out in May",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/02/exquisite-extraordinary-insightful-the-best-australian-books-out-in-may
5/2/2022,"Birdwatching tours are selling out, bush resorts are listing local birds on their websites and caravan park owners are sharing tips about where to find certain species. All over Australia, birdwatching is having a moment. A report released in April by BirdLife Australia reveals the economic impact of birdwatching tourism, with domestic birding trips contributing an estimated $283m to the Australian economy annually, much of this in regional communities. The owner of Great Northern Birdwatching Tours, David Mead, understands how much pulling power Queensland’s birds have. When he first opened the business in 2013, he ran various tours. He now caters exclusively to birdwatchers, partly due to demand, but also because he likes travelling with them. “Birdwatchers are great people,” Mead says. “Whether they’re looking at birds, reptiles or plants, they’re involved and observant. They love the environment and are focused on conservation.” As well as running tours, Mead participates in citizen science, contributing data on species such as the endangered Gouldian finch. Before the pandemic, almost half of Mead’s clients were from overseas, mainly from the UK and US. Since Australia’s borders have reopened, forward bookings for his small-group birding tours are strong, with some 2023 departures already sold out. “Birding is massive in North Queensland because you can find about half of Australia’s birds here,” Mead says, naming species like palm cockatoos and eclectus parrots as draw cards. He says birdwatching brings tourism dollars to small businesses in out-of-the-way places. For example, when visiting the remote community of Lockhart River in Cape York, Mead’s groups stay in Indigenous-owned accommodation. “It certainly benefits little towns in the middle of nowhere. In Birdsville, Bedourie and Boulia we stay in motels and eat in the one pub or restaurant in town each night.” Until recently, quantifying the scale of birdwatching tourism in Australia was tricky due to lack of data. BirdLife Australia’s Bird and Nature Tourism Report, prepared by Dr Rochelle Steven, a conservation scientist at Murdoch University, uses data from Tourism Research Australia and a survey conducted in 2021. The report found that bird tourism is a fast-growing niche market and that birders spend more than the average tourist. “For someone from the UK, seeing something as common as a rainbow lorikeet is a huge thrill,” Steven says. “The diversity of habitats and corresponding diversity of birds makes Australia the holy grail for birdwatchers.” Birdwatching was included in the National Visitor Survey conducted by Tourism Research Australia for the first time in 2019. “We know how many whale-watching boats there are, how many days they go out and how many people each boat holds, so we can get an indication of the magnitude of whale-watching,” Steven says. “But we can’t do that for birdwatching as we don’t have those surrogate measures to understand how many people are participating.” She believes that putting an economic value on birdwatching can rally support for conservation at a community level, but with so many species on the brink, much more needs to be done. Despite having one of the worst wildlife extinction records in the world, Australia’s unique wildlife is what makes it such an appealing destination for nature-based travel. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Many regional communities now see that continued habitat destruction through logging and land clearing can have negative economic impacts. After all, once you’ve killed the golden goose, you can’t get it back. “If a community sees the value birdwatching brings to the local economy, that can shift the dialogue and drive policies at a local level,” Steven says. “That patch of bush is now worth more to them left standing because they have birders coming to town visiting their coffee shops and pubs.” Avid birder and author of The Big Twitch, Sean Dooley, who also works for BirdLife Australia, says that “there’s hardly ever been any concerted, genuine effort at recognising bird-related tourism”. Instead, birdwatching tourism has risen organically – birders know where birds are, and savvy local tourism businesses pick up on it. “The market for bird tourism is very knowledgable,” Dooley says. “Places that harbour threatened, endangered and must-see species, those birds become iconic for those regions. It’s been a real boon for those places that have realised what they’ve got on their doorstep.” Over the years Dooley has witnessed a shift in how birdwatchers are perceived in regional communities. He’s visited the box-ironbark forests of Chiltern-Mt Pilot national park in north-east Victoria for decades, an area known for threatened species such as regent honeyeaters. “In the 90s, you’d get some deeply suspicious looks and occasionally, hostile scowls,” he says. “But now the locals are used to these weirdo bird nerds staying in their town. Now, locals engage you in conversation about birds. That’s a palpable change in community attitude.” Tasmania is another dream destination for birders. Only a 20-minute ferry ride from Kettering, Bruny Island is a haven for all 12 of Tasmania’s endemic bird species, including the endangered forty-spotted pardalote, one of Australia’s rarest birds. Launched in 2010, the biennial Bruny Island Bird festival attracts tourists and locals keen to celebrate the biodiverse island’s avian residents. Charlie Harkness, co-owner of Hundred Acre Hideaway, gets plenty of bookings from birders at his property, located in a valley abundant with birdlife including swift parrots and yellow-tailed black cockatoos. “We also have a pair of wedge-tails who have been known to fly down into the top paddock to procure a duck for breakfast,” he says. “A great sight for the guests and a sad day for our farm ducks.” Guests often spot birds from the deck of their cabin, but some go the extra mile. “One guest wandered around in the rain for a couple of hours in the hope of sighting his favoured birds,” Harkness says. In Queensland, Mead has also witnessed the extraordinary lengths (and cost) some will bear to tick a bird off their list. “One woman had been travelling Australia looking for a red goshawk for years – she’d never seen one as they’re rare,” he says. “When I took her to a nest site in Cape York, she cried her eyes out. It meant so much to her. “Some birdwatchers are crazy and fanatical, but they’re just fantastic people.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Do birders make good tourists? ‘In the 90s you’d get some deeply suspicious looks’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/02/do-birders-make-good-tourists-in-the-90s-youd-get-some-deeply-suspicious-looks

It’s not always immediately clear when a game was made in Australia, which makes it a little harder to celebrate homegrown hits – which we should do, because we have a thriving community of developers who punch well above their weight.

It’s hard to make a game about spiders in Australia that doesn’t immediately evoke images of horrible hairy huntsmen, or stories of deadly redbacks under toilet seats – but Sbug Games have only gone and bloody done it. You play this 2D puzzle platformer as a tiny and extremely adorable peacock jumping spider, trying to save her boyfriend from the clutches of a satin bowerbird. Not once does it rely on freaking-out arachnophobes or lean in to creepiness; instead, it’s a game about cooperation and banding together. Webbed was nominated for three Australian Game Developer awards, an Independent games festival award, and the Seamus McNally Grand prize at the IGFs. The popularity of game design degrees at Australian universities over recent years has propelled the quality of local student-made games into the stratosphere. Paperbark started out as one until it received VicScreen (formerly Film Victoria) funding for release to market. A beautiful point-and-click adventure game, it invokes the watercolour aesthetics of children’s storybooks like Possum Magic or Blinky Bill to explore a day in the life of the humble wombat as he fossicks through the bush for food. Eighteen years ago, a group of game developers decided to draw attention to Australia’s cruel treatment of asylum seekers by making a video game. Escape From Woomera was a sobering and distressing exposé of the inhumane conditions within Australian detention centres at a time where John Howard’s “sedition” laws hindered traditional media coverage. The government’s response was indignant and the Australia Council’s New Media Arts Board, which funded the game, was swiftly abolished; the Australia Council is only now starting to consider funding games again. Seen now as a significant cultural intervention and an example of “culture jamming”, Escape From Woomera is only starting to receive the recognition it deserves, almost two decades on. Push Me Pull You is a local co-op multiplayer couch sports game that feels absolutely disgusting in the most compelling way. Described as having a “Koonsian quality of both innocent and grotesque”, House House’s 2016 game soon sees your screen resembling human intestines as you battle the other team (also consisting of some kind of Cronenbergian nightmare) to keep the ball in your court. Push Me Pull You won best game and best design at the Freeplay awards, and an honourable mention for the Nuovo award at the 2015 Independent Games festival. Inside of you there are two wolves, and one of them wants to do face-melting guitar solos without learning how to play the guitar. The Artful Escape blends a bright psychedelic art style with one of the most underrated actions in all of video games: the slide. Sliding down huge hills while “pushing X to shred” is a visceral joy everyone should get the chance to experience. The Artful Escape was nominated for Golden Joystick and Game Awards, and took home the Bafta for artistic achievement. It is a beautiful day in the village, and you are a horrible goose. Just like Push Me Pull You, House House will lull you into a false sense of security and safety with a charming colour palette before introducing mischief. You play as a cheeky goose who is hellbent on ruining everyone’s day, from stealing the farmer’s keys to robbing a small child of his glasses. Untitled Goose Game has won many awards, including the Australian Game Developer awards, the Golden Joystick awards and a Bafta. Umurangi Generation is set in a dystopian future in Tauranga, New Zealand, after sea levels have risen and engulfed many major cities around the world. A twist on first-person shooter games, Umurangi is more like a scavenger hunt than combat thriller, with the player tasked with taking photographs instead of shooting weapons. This game has a lot to say about the climate crisis, neoliberalism and politics, and, in true Kiwi style, it doesn’t mind sticking the boot in where necessary – like when the in-game prime minister goes on holiday during a crisis. To whom could the game be referring? Who knew a game about one of life’s most stressful times could be so damn relaxing? Unpacking is a puzzle game about moving house and it packs a powerful narrative punch. Using no words at all, Unpacking slowly tells a story about our living spaces at different life stages, from our childhood bedroom to moving in with a crappy boyfriend who makes no room for your belongings (and has horrible taste). The team behind Unpacking will now have to make space for some extra items in their homes, such as Australian Game Developer awards, a Dice award and two Baftas. Commissioned by the Freeplay independent games festival and supported by Victoria Together, Apartment is a snapshot of lockdown life that will stick with me for ever. After leaving Melbourne for regional Victoria to go into lockdown with her family in March 2020, developer Kalonica Quigley digitally reconstructed the apartment she’d left from memory, and turned it into an explorable space to share with others. It’s a vulnerable and touching story about the intentions we put into our spaces and things, and how much it hurts to not be able to live the life we imagined for ourselves. If you’ve been lucky enough to get through the pandemic without losing anyone you love, it can feel ungracious to complain about the comparatively tiny problems we’ve experienced – but we’ve all had them. Apartment gives us the space to grieve all the little disappointments we’ve shared over the pandemic, draws you in for a cuddle and says, “I understand how you feel.”",Arts/Games,The 10 best video games made in Australia – sorted,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/may/02/the-10-best-video-games-made-in-australia-sorted
5/2/2022,"Scottish voters will cast their votes on Thursday in 32 local election races. But it’s possible that no party will win majority control of a mainland council. This is partly by design. These elections use the single-transferable-vote (STV) system. Scots rank their preferences instead of being forced by a first-past-the-post (FPTP) system to gamble on one party – often considered by voters as the least bad. By its nature, FPTP squashes small parties and leads to duopolies on power. In contrast, STV allocates seats more or less in line with the popular vote. The electoral system is one reason that “coalitions of losers” often win Scottish local election races. Another is that Scottish politics remains polarised around national identity. The Greens’ decision to enter the SNP-led Scottish government encourages supporters of these two parties to give lower preferences to each other’s candidates. This would give the SNP potentially a big advantage over the unionist parties which have not tacitly – or explicitly – recommended that their backers give lower preference votes to the candidates of other pro-union parties. However, council elections are fought in the streets on bread and butter, rather than constitutional, issues. Last month the Guardian highlighted North Ayrshire, run with a Labour minority. It was the first council in the UK to introduce free period products and the first in Scotland to put mental health counsellors in schools. These policies appealed to the young; a politically smart move when over-16s have the vote. Imitation, they say, is the sincerest form of flattery. Holyrood’s SNP government has taken North Ayrshire’ policies nationwide. Labour’s minority administration here works because – unusually in Scotland – the council is run on a cabinet system. North Ayrshire’s leftwing council leader, Joe Cullinane, in effect dares opposition councillors to reject popular policies. They rarely do. North Ayrshire even has a version of the “Preston model” where local public institutions spend more of a combined £1bn budget locally to enforce social goals. National polls suggest the SNP is well ahead, with Labour the second most popular party. All eyes this week will be on Glasgow, once a Labour stronghold, now run by the SNP. With the cost of living crisis uppermost in voters’ minds and Scottish councils struggling after a decade of cuts under SNP rule, material concerns ought not to be relegated to just another front in the constitutional battle. Although the Tories have attacked library closures and Labour promises cheaper bus and train fares, the fight to be Scotland’s largest unionist party militates against subliminal cooperation. Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, has ruled out formal coalitions with the SNP or the Tories after these elections. This strategy has proved unpopular with Labour councillors who have spent five years running coalition administrations. However, Mr Sarwar’s approach has been backed by Sir Keir Starmer. It is a gamble. In 2017’s local elections, polling shows seven in 10 Tory, Labour and SNP supporters used their transferable vote to express preferences for other parties. With Liberal Democrat supporters, the figure was even higher. If Scottish Labour cannot recover because of constitutional polarisation, it’s hard to see how Sir Keir can win a majority in Westminster. Labour is the largest party in only four Scottish councils – a tally that is behind the Conservatives. Mr Sarwar’s bet will have paid off if Labour reverses its fall.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Scotland’s May elections: Labour’s electoral gamble | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/01/the-guardian-view-on-scotlands-may-elections-labours-electoral-gamble
5/2/2022,"My friend and colleague Valentina Polukhina, who has died aged 85, was the leading authority on the life and work of the Nobel Laureate poet Joseph Brodsky. She wrote more than 20 books of literary criticism and did much to foster new Russian poetry. After arriving at Keele University as a language assistant, she rose to become its professor of Russian literature. Valentina was born in a poor Siberian village to Polina and Platon Borisov, who were farmworkers. She studied Russian language and linguistics at Tula University, graduating in 1962, and there met and married an engineering student, Vladimir Polukhin. Although their marriage did not last long, Valentina retained the surname of Polukhina throughout her life. For a while she taught in a remote school in Dagestan, then at Moscow University of Friendship. In 1973 she lived briefly in Kenya, before going to work as a Russian language assistant at Keele University. Valentina made an immediate and unforgettable impact. Students loved her flamboyant character, her very un-English directness, and the fact that she cared deeply about their progress and general well-being. She was an invaluable colleague, supportive and generous, and did all she could to promote Russian studies, nationally and internationally. Thanks to her, many distinguished Russian writers went to Keele, most notably the poet who became the subject of her life’s work, Brodsky. Valentina rose in 20 years to become a lecturer, senior lecturer, reader, and finally, in 1997, professor. Upon retirement in 2001, she moved to London, where she married the poet and translator Professor Daniel Weissbort. Valentina considered her dozen years of marriage to Daniel to be the happiest period of her life. They were able to share their love of poetry, travelling, and the intellectual life more generally, and Daniel dedicated a number of moving poems to her. Daniel died in 2013. Valentina continued working, travelling, publishing, and corresponding with poets and others connected to literature. She was also in close and frequent contact with her family in Russia. Her last article – about Brodsky, naturally – was published in the Russian literary journal Novy Mir – New World - in 2021. She loved Siamese cats and fashion – Issy Miyake was a favourite designer – and collected antique furniture. In her last years she became a devout Orthodox Christian. Valentina is survived by her stepchildren, Daniel, Naomi and Rebecca, and by a half-sister, Tamara.",Arts/Books,Valentina Polukhina obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/01/valentina-polukhina-obituary
5/2/2022,"The race for the remaining Champions Cup place is far from over after a remarkable comeback from London Irish enabled them to snatch a draw from a contest they had all but lost. Twenty minutes into the second half, when Jimmy Gopperth converted Wasps’ fifth try, the Exiles were staring at a 39-14 deficit. But the home team rallied, scoring three tries and snatching a stoppage time penalty try in the final 13 minutes. The draw hardly serves both teams. Irish remain in eighth place with Wasps one place and one point behind them but, crucially, have a game in hand but must finish the campaign away against the leaders Leicester. Before then, though, there will be some hard questions asked inside that Wasps dressing room. They were cruising and should have seen this one out. Their advantage was built on a commanding bedrock of solid defence and an indomitable set-piece. The only explanation can be that they believed it was over before it was. They opened the scoring on 13 minutes. With Irish giving away a breakdown penalty, Wasps set a maul that was initially stalled but found momentum with a second shove. The impressive Gabriel Oghre emerged with the ball and five points. Irish responded with a rare bit of magic. Tom Pearson managed what few of his teammates had by offloading in the tackle. It was shifted right where Benhard Janse van Rensburg found space in the wide channel before floating it on for Kyle Rowe to finish. Full-back Tom Parton nudged Irish ahead with the try of the game. From the base of a scrum inside his own half, the scrum-half Nick Phipps shaped to go right but then went left. Paddy Jackson then chipped a perfect kick behind Wasps’ right wing Francois Hougaard who could only watch the onrushing Ollie Hassell-Collins collect a kind bounce. The young Englishman drew in the final tackler and provided a textbook assist inside for the supporting Parton. Eddie Jones, in attendance, would no doubt have been impressed. Hougaard would have been stung by the lapse and the Springbok soon made amends. It was his mighty hit on Parton that turned possession. Minutes later another powerful Wasps scrum wheeled Irish’s pack inside their 22, widening the space on the blindside. Dan Robson fired a bullet pass to Hougaard who scored unopposed. Wasps had the lead they deserved with Robson again offering the final pass. A strong maul from a lineout in the corner moved infield before losing momentum under the posts. But Robson kept his cool and played a cut pop off his shoulder for Charlie Atkinson five metres out. The result seemed assured six minutes after the restart when Hougaard completed a simple move that was effectively defended by mannequins. Credit will go to the All Black Malakai Fekitoa for straightening and shifting it wide at pace, but London Irish apparently stopped trying with eyes on their Challenge Cup tie away to Toulon next week. This was reflected in both the substitutions made by Declan Kidney - Phipps, Agustín Creevy and Albert Tuisue were all pulled on 50 minutes – as well as the visceral drop in energy. A nothing kick was shunted straight to Josh Bassett who cantered 40m without an Irish player landing a hand on him. He might have gone for glory himself but played in Zach Kibirige instead. Perhaps that was the blow Irish needed as they finally rallied. Pearson scored on 67 minutes through a maul and the replacement Henry Arundell chipped, chased and gathered to score with eight left on the clock. The closing exchanges were the most engrossing, and when Jackson brought his team to within a score by converting Hassell-Collins’s scything run down the left touchline, a remarkable comeback began to materialise. Jacob Umaga kicked a conversion to stretch the gap to seven points for Wasps but Irish were not done. A late surge, two quickly tapped penalty darts and a lineout maul brought them within a stretch of the tryline. The pressure told as Wasps stopped the charge illegally and were punished. The final word went to a bewildered fan near the press box who yelled “Lazarus” over and over again.",Sport/Sport,Pearson and Arundell lead London Irish comeback to snatch draw with Wasps,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/01/london-irish-wasps-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
