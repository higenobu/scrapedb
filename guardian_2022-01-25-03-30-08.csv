1/25/2022,"Russia’s aggressive buildup near Ukraine energised Nato into sending more forces to eastern Europe on Monday and led to a plunge on Russian markets, raising the stakes on the Kremlin’s bet that it could cajole, extort or force Ukraine into submission. For Moscow it has become more difficult to pull back from its aggressive stance after US and Nato announcements that more troops would be deployed to the military alliance’s eastern flank. A unilateral drawdown now would leave the Kremlin a clear loser in the standoff, having provoked a strengthening of the very Nato presence that it had sought to banish from eastern Europe.  Moscow has blamed the west for rising tensions and the chaos on Russian financial markets. “We are observing statements published by the North Atlantic alliance about an enlargement of the contingent and the deployment of forces and hardware to the eastern flank. All that leads to the further escalation of tensions,” claimed Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, on Monday. “Please note that all of that is not happening because of what we, Russia, do. This is happening because of the actions of Nato and the United States and the information they release.” Moscow’s dubious diplomacy and unprecedented buildup along the Ukrainian border, including in neighbouring Belarus, had already convinced many security analysts that the Kremlin is seeking a war. There was never much chance that the foreign ministry would secure its maximalist “security guarantees”, including the retreat of Nato from all countries that joined the alliance after 1997. But Vladimir Putin does still have the option to turn back. An about-face would be embarrassing and make the west less likely to listen to his warnings in the future. But he would face little domestic blowback from ordering a drawdown and could claim he had taken the first step to avoid a devastating conflict. Yet that has become less likely as Moscow begins to face serious economic and political consequences from its great gambit. Western government have shown they take the threat of war seriously, warning of tough sanctions and even beginning to order the evacuation of families of diplomats in Ukraine because of the threat of “significant military action against Ukraine.” Russian financial markets took a beating as they woke up this week to the devastating potential for a conflict with Ukraine. Russian blue-chip stocks such as Sberbank and Gazprom lost more than 10% in trading on Monday and the Russian Central Bank was forced to temporarily halt purchases of foreign currency as the rouble has fallen nearly 6% against the dollar since the beginning of January. And Moscow’s public demands that Nato clear out of eastern and central Europe have backfired as the threat of war has increased the demands for deployments closer to Russia’s borders. “We are reaching the point where continuous Russian and Belarusian military buildup in Europe needs to be addressed by appropriate Nato countermeasures,” said Edgars Rinkēvičs, the Latvian foreign minister, said on Monday. “It is time to increase allied forces presence in the alliance’s eastern flank both as measures of defence and deterrence.” Nato said some member countries would put troops on standby and deploy ships and fighter jets to the region as a military conflict in Ukraine appears increasingly likely. And the Biden administration is considering deploying thousands of troops to eastern European countries in a “major pivot” from its previous previous “do-not-provoke [Russia] strategy”, the New York Times reported. While the deployments are unlikely to deter a Russian attack in Ukraine, they are a signal that Nato countries are ready to strengthen their presence in the region. The Biden administration is said to be considering a tenfold increase in forces to eastern Europe if Putin does launch an attack. “Nato itself will continue to be reinforced in a significant way if Russia commits renewed acts of aggression. All of that is on the table,” the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on the Sunday morning US TV programme Face the Nation. Russian officials who have overseen the buildup are now accusing the west of provoking a crisis. “The threat of Russia’s assault on Ukraine, which exists solely in the fevered minds of the west, is being taken advantage of to rationalise the alliance’s relevance and willingness to give ‘protection’ to its allies,” said the Russian deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko. But as the standoff continues, the costs for Moscow are rising, possibly convincing the Kremlin that the time to act is now.",News/World news,Rising costs of Ukraine gamble could force Russia’s hand,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/rising-costs-of-ukraine-gamble-could-force-russias-hand
1/25/2022,"Leeds United and West Yorkshire police are reviewing crowd safety protocols at Elland Road after hundreds of Newcastle United fans complained about a crush outside the ground’s away end on Saturday. Severe traffic congestion around Elland Road meant that many supporters arrived slightly later than planned for a Premier League game won 1-0 by Newcastle. With 3,000 away fans having made the trip and matters further slowed by Covid passport checks, significant overcrowding occurred around five turnstiles.  Eventually officials opened wider access gates and a Leeds spokesman confirmed a review of safety procedures was under way. “The club acknowledges the complaints raised by some Newcastle United supporters regarding issues experienced entering Elland Road on Saturday,” he said. “Leeds United will now work with the Newcastle Supporters Trust (NUST), West Yorkshire Police and our own safety team to review the issues raised and ensure we continue to provide a safe environment for everyone attending our stadium.” The NUST chair, Greg Tomlinson, was heartened by Leeds’s response. “The Trust has raised significant concerns to Leeds United in relations to the issues that could have resulted in serious injury or worse and were not the fault of any Newcastle United fans,” he said. “I welcome the quick response from Leeds United and their commitment to undertaking a review. No football supporter should go to a match and be in fear of their own safety. There were issues when we played at Elland Road in November 2016 and it was even worse at the weekend. It is imperative lessons are learnt to prevent this from happening again.” Alex Hurst, an NUST board member told the True Faith Podcast: “I went to Leeds in 2016 and it was a disgrace – the access, that crush you don’t feel anywhere else at football grounds. On Saturday nothing had improved. I’m at at loss as to how Leeds think this is an acceptable way to treat people and keep them safe. “Essentially there were only two entrances and five turnstiles for nearly 3,000 people. I got there half an hour before kick-off because I knew it was difficult getting in but I still missed kick-off. In the end, they just opened the wider access points – it was a very unsafe situation.”",Sport/Football,Leeds to review crowd safety after Newcastle fans complain of crush,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/24/leeds-to-review-crowd-safety-after-newcastle-fans-complain-of-crush
1/25/2022,"The deepening tensions between Russia, the world’s biggest gas producer, and Ukraine have reignited fears that the Kremlin may weaponise its gas reserves by restricting exports to Europe in the face of potential sanctions. Russia is western Europe’s largest single supplier of gas, a commodity that is in tight supply globally and has reached record market price highs in recent weeks, threatening to tip the UK into a national energy crisis.  Meanwhile, Europe may need to use even more gas to keep the lights on this winter after the French nuclear firm EDF warned that technical trouble at a string of its reactors would cut its electricity generation, meaning gas plants across Europe may need to run more than expected. Gas plants were already in high demand over the past year after slow wind speeds reduced Europe’s renewable energy output in 2021. This played a role in draining Europe’s gas storage facilities to record lows after a long, cold winter last year. Ministers have reportedly been warned that the UK could face further record-breaking prices for gas and at the petrol pumps. So, could Europe’s energy crisis become a catastrophe? The good news is that the UK imports barely any gas from Russia. It meets about half of its gas requirements from the North Sea, while another third is sourced from Norway. The rest is imported by pipelines connecting the UK to Europe, or in the form of liquified natural gas (LNG), which is transported by tankers typically from Qatar or the US. The bad news? The UK’s gas sources could all becoming eye-wateringly expensive if markets in Europe soar. The UK’s market is closely connected to markets in Europe, so a price rise in Germany or the Netherlands would lead to higher prices in Britain. There is no end in sight to Europe’s gas market woes. The US investment bank Goldman Sachs said on Monday: “The high energy prices seen in recent months are not necessarily a one-off.” Gas prices are likely to stay twice as high as normal until 2025, it said, and if Europe faces colder than average temperatures in March and February, blackouts could be likely. Very. Russia typically supplies about a third of Europe’s gas via a complex network of pipelines that run through Ukraine, Belarus and Poland to Germany. From Germany, pipelines carry gas to the rest of western Europe and through to the UK. A major gas supply disruption to Ukraine, last seen in 2008, could cause severe market volatility and a shutdown of factories to help conserve gas. Market experts at S&P Global warned that “any conflict impacting gas supplies into Europe could have knock-on impacts on power, carbon and coal prices”. At the same time, Europe may become more dependent on gas to run its gas power plants after EDF warned that it would reduce the electricity it generates from nuclear power by 10% this year because of technical problems at a handful of its reactors. In the UK, lower imports of electricity from France – supplied via two interconnector cables beneath the Channel – could mean more gas power generation, according to Tom Edwards, a senior analyst at Cornwall Insight. This could lead to a rise in prices across the gas and electricity markets. In the meantime, the French government has asked EDF to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill increases to 4% this year. Barbara Pompili, France’s environment minister, said the government planned to help EDF withstand the blow but it has raised questions over how EDF plans to finance new nuclear projects, including the Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C projects in the UK. It appears not. If the government is concerned about the impact on UK energy supplies, it hasn’t admitted it. A government spokesperson did not respond directly to the Guardian’s questions over whether there was a contingency plan in place to secure the UK’s energy supplies, or protect against further record market prices as tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border intensify. The spokesperson said that unlike other countries in Europe, “the UK is in no way dependent on Russian gas supply” and relied on less than 3% of Russian gas in 2020. “Thanks to our diverse mix of nuclear, natural gas and renewable technologies, the UK has one of the most reliable energy systems in the world,” the spokesperson added. The UK government is under pressure to take action to safeguard households from a cost of living crisis that is expected to deepen in the coming weeks as the energy regulator prepares to raise its cap on bills to close to an average of £2,000 a year on 7 February. The government was reportedly in talks late last year with Qatar over a deal that could result in the gas-rich nation supplying extra cargoes of gas in the event of an energy emergency, according to the Financial Times. But the government denied requesting that Qatar act as a “supplier of last resort”. The weekend tensions caused the price of short-term gas to climb to 205.1p per therm in the UK on Monday morning, up from 188.75p/th on Friday. The price is more than threefold higher than this time last year, and six times higher than typical pre-pandemic levels, according to Tom Marzec-Manser, a senior gas expert at ICIS. The UK’s gas market price climbed to more than 450p/th in the run-up to Christmas as Russian gas supplies slumped in line with temperatures that drove demand for gas heating higher. “I don’t think it’s unreasonable to believe that gas markets could return to the highs we saw late last year if things were to escalate to the point that gas supplies were affected,” Marzec-Manser said. For now, there are a few lucky breaks that have helped to keep soaring gas markets in check, he added. Gas demand in Asia is lower, which has allowed Europe to receive a record number of LNG deliveries from the US this month, and it is on track to reach an all-time monthly LNG import high. However, a major gas supply disruption could be enough to cause gas prices to soar back to record levels.",News/Business,How vulnerable is UK energy system as tensions rise between Russia and Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/24/how-vulnerable-is-uk-energy-system-as-tensions-rise-between-russia-and-ukraine
1/25/2022,"The fate of more than 700 boys and teenage detainees has become central to the siege of a Kurdish-run prison in Syria that was overrun on Friday by jihadists, who are accused of using the boys as human shields. As the siege around the Ghwayran prison in the Kurdish-run northern city of Hasakah entered a fifth day, Islamic State prisoners inside moved into a dormitory housing the boys, some of whom are as young as 12, in an attempt to prevent an assault by Kurdish forces stationed outside.  Leaders from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said there had been multiple deaths and injuries among the child prisoners. Save the Children, which has provided support to the prisoners over the past three years, urged renewed efforts to repatriate the boys, many of whom are from outside Syria and were caught up in the rise and fall of the so-called caliphate as the children of IS members. The siege and allegations of the use of human shields have cast renewed light on the practice of holding child detainees and of the refusal of foreign governments to repatriate their citizens nearly three years after IS lost all its remaining territory in Syria’s far eastern deserts. “What we are hearing from Ghwayran prison is deeply distressing,” said Save the Children’s Syria response director, Sonia Khush. “Reports that children have been killed or injured are tragic and outrageous. “Responsibility for anything that happens to these children also lies at the door of foreign governments who have thought that they can simply abandon their child nationals in Syria. Risk of death or injury is directly linked to these governments’ refusal to take them home. “All foreign children must be repatriated – with their families – without any further delay. The international community cannot have the blood of any of these children on their hands.” Farhad Shami, the head of SDF media, said: “They are mostly not Syrian and we captured them during the time of the fall of Baghouz [the last holdout of IS territory in early 2019]. “We initially made camps for them near Raqqa and Deir Azzour, then they were moved to this prison.” Many of the boys are alleged to have been drafted into the ranks of the so-called “Cubs of the Caliphate”, a child army used by IS leaders as cannon fodder, or as saboteurs that could more easily infiltrate civilian areas. “These young people were trained by Isis [IS] for suicide attacks and other military operations,” said Shami. “Now Isis has taking control of that part of the prison and we cannot fight or bomb them.” Kurdish leaders released footage of scores of detainees surrendering outside the walls of the Ghwayran prison in the city’s south – one of the main detention centres for the remnants of IS in north-east Syria. The SDF said about 300 prisoners had given themselves up and claimed to have the prison fully surrounded by up to 10,000 troops. Earlier fears that the attack on the prison in the early hours of Friday had freed hundreds of extremists appear to have been doused, with US officials and Kurdish leaders confident that only 20-30 IS members remain at large, most thought to be hiding in nearby neighbourhoods, which remained in full lockdown on Monday. One escaper was caught wearing an abaya (a woman’s robe) on Monday. “There is still gunfire, we can hear it during day and night, and we can hear airstrikes sometimes,” said Hozan Ali, 37, a Hasakah resident. “Helicopters are flying over the area 24 hours a day. No one can enter the city or leave. Those Isis who are still here wear women’s clothes with niqab [full face coverings]. This is going on longer than we thought.” In a statement, the Global Coalition Against Isis – the international coalition of countries aiming to destroy IS – said the IS assault on the prison was “a desperate attempt to replenish its depleted ranks and to regain lost momentum”. It added: “The Coalition commends its Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) partners for their courageous response to the attack, and offers its condolences to the families of those killed. This and other recent attacks in Syria and Iraq remind us that Daesh [IS] is still a threat in the region. The Global Coalition remains committed to the enduring defeat of [IS]”. Save the Children said it was in possession of audio recordings of one boy pleading for help. It had been providing the children with recreational spaces, relief supplies and fresh foods along with psychological support. Rehabilitation of children caught up in the horrors of IS has been a significant challenge for NGOs and Kurdish officials, who say they do not have the capacity for such mental health support. “The boys must be able to receive the medical support they need for any injuries sustained in the attack, as well as access to mental health support to process and begin to recover from their experiences,” said Khush. “It is vital that all these children are supported to recover and re-integrate back into their communities safely, so that they can rebuild their lives.” Kurdish leaders in north-east Syria have also warned repeatedly that IS was regrouping in the shadows of the region’s still battered towns and cities, preparing for an operation like the one launched on Friday, when about 100 men are thought to have attacked the prison after first igniting a car bomb at its gates. Since then, at least 85 IS members are believed to have been killed in clashes, along with close to 45 SDF members and seven civilians. The UN says an estimated 45,000 civilians have been temporarily displaced.",News/World news,Hundreds of boys ‘human shields’ in Islamic State prison breakout ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/hundreds-of-boys-human-shields-in-islamic-state-prison-breakout
1/25/2022,"Watford have sacked Claudio Ranieri less than four months after giving the Italian the task of keeping them in the Premier League. Ranieri was appointed after the sacking of Xisco Muñoz in October, but he has been unable to make a positive impact and has picked up only seven points during his 13 league games in charge. Patience has been wearing thin for a while and Watford, who have slipped to 19th after losing 3-0 at home to Norwich City last Friday, are looking for their third manager of the season.  Watford’s owner, Gino Pozzo, has never been slow to make a change in the dugout when results are bad and Ranieri has paid the price after 16 weeks for being unable to inspire his squad. The 70-year-old has won only two games since replacing Muñoz, who was deemed too inexperienced for the Premier League, and has recently looked short of ideas. Watford said in statement confirming Ranieri’s departure that he was “a man of great integrity and honour, who will always be respected here at Vicarage Road for his efforts in leading the team with dignity”. Explaining the move, the club continued: “With nearly half of the Premier League campaign remaining, a change in the head coach position now will give a new appointment sufficient time to work with a talented squad to achieve the immediate goal of retaining Premier League status.” Questions will inevitably be raised about the decision to fire Muñoz. The Spaniard won promotion last season and Watford were 15th when they sacked him. There has been no improvement under Ranieri, whose greatest achievement was helping Leicester City win the title in 2016. The former Chelsea manager was a surprising appointment given that he fared disastrously when Fulham were relegated from the Premier League in 2019. Watford had seemed to be on the right track when Ranieri inspired them to a famous 4-1 win over Manchester United on 27 November. But they have picked up only one point since – a 1-1 draw with fellow strugglers Newcastle two weekends back – and the performance against Norwich was the final straw. It was Watford’s 11th defeat in 14 games under Ranieri. Attention will turn to who is given the task of trying to save Watford from relegation. They do not play again until their rearranged fixture away to Burnley on 5 February. Watford have previously been linked with Diego Martínez, the 41-year-old Spaniard who left his post at Granada last May. Watford have not won in nine games in all competitions, their longest run without a victory since December 2013.",Sport/Football,Watford sack manager Claudio Ranieri after grim 14-game tenure,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/24/watford-sack-manager-claudio-ranieri-after-grim-14-game-tenure
1/25/2022,"In the summer of 2020 a group of five cyclists from Ramallah were out on a ride when they were stopped by a group of Israeli settlers. According to Reuters, on discovering the cyclists were Palestinian, the settlers began hurling stones at them. Four escaped into a nearby field. One, Samer Kurdi, lost his footing and was repeatedly beaten with a metal rod, suffering serious injuries. It is not known if any arrests were made. For Chris Froome and his colleagues on the Israel Start-Up Nation pro cycling team, the roads of the occupied West Bank were a far safer place last November, as they rolled through the Judaean Hills on an open training ride. English-language media were flown out to Israel and given full access to the team during their first camp in Israel since 2019. The team and their followers were treated to luxury hospitality, taken on beach visits and kayaking excursions. But then Israel Start-Up Nation – the fledgling team relaunched last week as Israel-Premier Tech – has always known the value of good PR.  Peter Sagan was one of its early ambassadors, and the recruitment of other top riders like Froome, Sep Vanmarcke and Dan Martin have helped to grow its sporting reputation. But the team’s most enthusiastic publicist is billionaire co-owner Sylvan Adams, a self-styled “ambassador-at-large for the State of Israel” who sees in sport a means of enhancing the country’s standing amid widespread criticism over its human rights record, treatment of Palestinians and continued defiance of international law. It was Adams who drove Israel’s audacious £9m bid to host the start of the Giro d’Italia in 2018, the first part of an unprecedented investment in international sport. The same year he built the region’s first Olympic-standard velodrome, which will host the junior track worlds in August. Argentina and Uruguay visited Tel Aviv for an international friendly in 2019, as did Paris Saint-Germain and Lille last August for France’s equivalent of the Community Shield. There is even some serious talk within Fifa of a joint 2030 World Cup bid with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Adams insists that Israel Premier-Tech is apolitical and not a government project, although it receives funding – a “pitifully small amount”, he says – from the national tourism board. And while the likes of Bahrain, the UAE and Kazakhstan all sponsor World Tour teams, none has been this open or vocal about its soft power objectives. “We’re perceived as a warzone here in Israel, that we’re in a state of conflict,” Adams has said. “We want the team to help tell the story you don’t often hear about.” Ron Baron, the team’s other co-owner, describes it as a form of “sport diplomacy”. According to Guy Niv, one of the team’s few Israeli cyclists and a former army sniper, every rider understands that “being on an Israeli team, they are ambassadors for the country”. When we refer to sportswashing, the attempt by nation-states to sanitise their reputations and launder their crimes, there is a certain kind of country we’re usually thinking of. We have no problem linking the manifold abuses of Qatar or Saudi Arabia or China to their investment in sport. And yet there appears to be a certain squeamishness about referring to Israel in similar terms, even though its aims are even more explicitly stated, its crimes well documented by human rights groups. The primary objective of Israeli sporting diplomacy is that when you hear the country’s name, you won’t think of any of this. You won’t think about military checkpoints or the bombing of Gaza or the Palestinian occupation, or really Palestinians at all. Instead you’ll think about golden beaches, rooftop cocktails, Lionel Messi and Chris Froome bathed in a glorious sunset. “Most people don’t care about politics,” Adams has said. “Through world-class cultural and sporting events, we can reach the silent majority.” But push at the door a little, and all the classic sportswashing tropes are present: denial, whataboutery, the curious blend of incredulity and aggression. “This is a peaceful country, go and hassle people who work in totalitarian regimes,” Adams told Cycling Weekly in 2020 in response to questions on Israel’s human rights abuses. Meanwhile, Twitter users were quick to spot that around the time Froome’s move to Israel Start-Up Nation was announced, his Twitter picture – a photograph from the Giro in which a number of Palestinian flags are visible in the crowd – was quietly deleted. In many ways cycling is the ideal sportswashing partner: a sport with no real tradition of political activism, where cash-strapped teams are generally none too precious about where the money is coming from. But there is another dimension to this: for many cycling is synonymous with freedom, the open road, the intimate connection between humans and the land. For Palestinian cyclists, running a daily gauntlet of checkpoints, roadblocks, violence and economic hardship, the bike is its own quiet form of resistance. “It is our duty to keep our relationship with this land,” a Palestinian cyclist called Sohaib Samara told the Guardian in 2020. “If we stop moving around, the occupiers will steal more of it.” And so for Israel sport serves a dual function: both positive reinforcement and tool of repression. In March 2018, a promising Palestinian cyclist called Alaa al-Dali attended a march in Gaza with his bike, wearing cycling kit, to protest against Israel’s refusal to allow him to travel abroad for international competition. According to a United Nations report, he was shot by an Israeli sniper in the leg, which then had to be amputated after his request to leave Gaza for treatment was denied by Israeli authorities. He now competes as a para-cyclist.",Sport/Sport,Sportswashing is associated with certain countries – why not Israel? | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/24/sportswashing-is-associated-with-certain-countries-why-not-israel
1/25/2022,"Peter Seabrook, who has died aged 86, brought gardening to millions of people through his broadcasting and writing, standing up for traditional values while promoting new plant breeding and innovation. He often said he was the most-read garden journalist in Britain, claiming 10 million readers for his weekly pages of gardening advice, promotions, opinion and campaigns in the Sun; and during his stint on the BBC’s Gardeners’ World in the 1970s the show regularly attracted 8 million viewers a week. Seabrook represented back-to-basics gardening and, while relentlessly seeking out scientific breakthroughs in plant breeding and production, he was critical of the modish and the ill-informed. He would ask “Who likes garden design?” and would regularly criticise the advice given by some of his successors on gardening TV, who perhaps had not done the hard yards he had covered during his early days in horticulture.  Seabrook was born in Chelmsford, Essex, the son of Emma (nee Cottey) and Robert Seabrook. His father worked in a ball-bearing factory as a tool grinder but Peter was brought up on his grandparents’ farm in nearby Galleywood. Educated at King Edward VI grammar school in the city, he studied horticulture at Writtle College, and began his career in the 50s, with his values instilled from a background in farming and national service. He worked initially for the seed merchants and nurserymen Cramphorn from 1958 until 1966, then for the Irish peat board Bord na Mona from 1966 until 1970. It was during the 60s that plants were first sold in containers, rather than bare root, and Seabrook was in on the innovation, which helped develop garden centres as we know them today, as retailers could sell plants in pots year-round rather than just in season. His expertise led him to start writing for trade magazines – he got his first writing job at a nurseryman journal by pointing out factual errors to the editor – and then broke into radio with the BBC’s In Your Garden (1965-70). This led to TV appearances, including the afternoon show Garden Diary on Anglia TV, which was cancelled in 1974 because of cuts caused by the three-day week. He shifted to the popular lunchtime programme Pebble Mill at One from 1975 until 1986. After the BBC sacked its household-name presenter Percy Thrower for promoting ICI, from 1976 until 1979 Seabrook presented the flagship gardening show Gardeners’ World. The new presenter earned £75 a programme, researching, presenting, responding to letters with sage advice and occasionally producing. The thousands of letters he answered in longhand formed the basis of his humorous after-dinner speaking. One cheeky correspondent said Seabrook’s gardening skills passed muster, so he would be suitable to tend their garden while they were on holiday. They then listed dates, location and the work they needed doing. Seabrook was succeeded on the show by the organic gardener Geoff Hamilton, with whom he had several skirmishes during his career, as their views on gardening were diametrically opposed. They even consulted lawyers at one point. Seabrook, despite being loyal, gentlemanly, charming and personable, was never one to back down on his strongly held views on controversial subjects such as the value of using peat to grow plants in. Recently, he had campaigned for the government to reconsider its plan to ban peat, which is widely considered to be environmentally damaging. To the last, he fought against what he saw as woolly thinking and poor horticultural standards, in everyone from the BBC to the RHS. Nevertheless, Seabrook was seen worldwide (in the US he hosted PBS series The Victory Garden from 1975 to 1997) as the archetypal English old-school gardener, and was much loved for it. He was ever-present at the RHS Chelsea flower show from 1952 and, after starting work at the tabloid in 1977, presented the Sun gardens there, grown by schoolchildren and bursting with new plant varieties. His wife, Margaret, whom he married in 1960 after meeting her at horticulture college, died in 2020 of Covid-19 after living with Alzheimer’s for almost a decade. Characteristically, Seabrook launched a plant, Verbena “Margaret’s Memory”, to raise money for the Alzheimer’s Society. The pale pink perennial was planted at RHS Garden Hyde Hall, near his home in Chelmsford, where he created the Floral Fantasia bedding plant displays. Margaret’s death led him to write a heartfelt plea to the government asking for the reopening of garden centres during lockdown for the good of the nation’s mental health. He was appointed MBE in 2005 and was the only person to hold the RHS’s top three awards, the Victoria medal of honour (awarded in 2003), Associate of Honour and Harlow Carr medal. In an article marking his 85th birthday in 2020, in the magazine Horticulture Week, for which he was an opinion writer, he said that he still had “so much to do, so much to learn”. He is survived by a son, Roger, and daughter, Alison, and two grandchildren.

1/25/2022,"A Dior haute couture show in the gardens of the Musée Rodin is as Parisian as fashion gets. But this season, designer Maria Grazia Chiuri’s heart was in India. “There is an idea that Indian embroidery is something cheap,” said Chiuri before the show. “We talk a lot about the incredible ateliers we have here in the Avenue Montaigne. But Indian artisans make embroidery with just the same knowledge and expertise and depth of tradition as embroidery in France and Italy. This excellence is not just ours.”  The clothes on the catwalk were kept deliberately simple. The high-buttoning double-breasted Bar jackets which Chiuri has placed at the centre of her Dior aesthetic were made in unbleached ecru wool. In matt black Moroccan silk crepe for day or fine silver lamé for evening, dresses were clean-lined and fluid as nightgowns. This directed the spotlight away from the clothes and towards the vast tapestries which decorated the show venue, which comprise a retrospective of the work of two Indian artists, Madhvi and Manu Parekh, rendered in embroidery by the Chanakya School of Craft in Mumbai. Karishma Swali, director of the school, described the installation, which will be open to the public until 30 January, as “both an art gallery and a celebration of the connection between artists and artisans”. Madhvi Parekh’s work draws on folk art, village craft and symbols of female energy, while that of her husband, Manu, leans toward modernism and abstraction. The show marks a first collaboration with a male artist for Chiuri, who has partnered with female artists across different media for many past Dior collections. Chiuri has worked with Swali and her workshops since 1995, when she was designing for Fendi. “To be a couture brand today comes with a responsibility to support the fashion community all over the world,” she said, adding that this responsibility has intensified with the damage done to many livelihoods by Covid. “We share a connection, because in Italy, where I come from, and in India, there is a generational problem with savoir-faire disappearing. Families push their kids towards studying, or to jobs like becoming a doctor, because in fashion we talk too much about the designer who makes the sketch and not enough about all the other important jobs.” While Mumbai artisans spent 200,000 hours creating the giant tapestries in organic plant-based threads, Chiuri was preoccupied with crystal-embroidered socks, and shoes in which the heels were entirely embroidered. “You think it’s just a sock, but embroidery is very tricky,” she said.",Lifestyle/Fashion,‘Depth of tradition’: Dior haute couture show celebrates India’s art and embroidery,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/24/depth-of-tradition-dior-haute-couture-show-celebrates-indias-art-and-embroidery

She was a key driver in the discussions that led to the creation of the West Bromwich African Caribbean Resource Centre in 1985.  The fifth child of eight, born in the parish of Longwood, in Clarendon, Jamaica, to Esmie (nee Mitchell) and David Reid, a supervisor at Moneymusk West Indies Sugar Cane Company, Victoria went to Alley school, then worked as a dressmaker before journeying to England in 1960. She settled in West Bromwich, where she had friends, and found work in a factory. By 1962 she had saved enough to send for her fiancé, Herman Frank, who later worked as a supervisor for a steel fabrication factory. They married the same year. In 1974 Victoria moved to the Smith Corona typewriter factory, then from 1986 worked as assistant to the nurse administering medical support at the Konix factory until 1991, when she left to set up a guest house for prison leavers with Herman. She cooked meals for the ex-offenders and assisted them with their rehabilitation and finding employment. In 1996 she began working for Sandwell council as an assistant manager in health and social care, until retirement in 2001. As a founding member of the West Bromwich African Caribbean Resource Centre, Victoria served as treasurer, then vice chair for many years, and finally a short spell as chair before retirement. Her responsibilities included staff recruitment, funding negotiations and entertainment, and she initiated the creation of the Senior Citizens Luncheon Club, which is still operating. She was key to the centre winning a Pace (Public Award for Community Excellence) in 2004. Victoria was multi-talented, designing and sewing garments to create unique outfits, and making delicious rum cake and Caribbean food. She fought her entire life for more, and to be more. Hers was an inspirational life, leaving a true legacy in all she achieved for others. Herman died in 2010. Victoria is survived by their daughters, Eula, Rose, Bev and me, and three granddaughters, Louise, Samara and Merissa.",News/Society,Victoria Frank obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/24/victoria-frank-obituary
1/25/2022,"My brother, Chris Harding, who has died aged 70, had a long academic career in the department of law and criminology at Aberystwyth University, first as a lecturer in European law and from 1995 as professor of law. He published a large body of work on legal, criminological and historical subjects, including research on EU criminal law and policy such as the legal control and criminology of business cartels. Chris was the eldest of four children and grew up in Shepperton, Middlesex, with his parents, Irene (nee Hook), a seamstress, and Tony Harding, a toolmaker, and three sisters. He attended Hampton grammar school (now Hampton school) and in time met his future wife, Jenny (nee Horsnell), who attended the neighbouring girls’ grammar school.  He then started his move westward – first to study for a BA in jurisprudence at University College, University of Oxford, where he discovered a passion for criminal jurisprudence and penal theory, and then to the University of Exeter, for more specialist postgraduate work in the newly emergent field of European law. This led to a full-time academic post at Aberystwyth University in mid-Wales, in what was, in the mid-1970s, quite an idiosyncratic law school. Looking back at that time, Chris described himself as “something of a new species of academic, with the opportunity to carry out some pioneering work in what proved to be a stimulating environment”. Chris and Jenny married in 1974. Chris had a passion for writing, often in collaboration with others, and his many books, edited works and research papers ranged from texts on EEC competition law and EU criminal law to historical texts on criminal justice. His specialist field in recent years was the normative, social scientific and cultural aspects of the interrelation between individuals and groups and organisations, both historically and in contemporary society, and at national, European and international levels. He once said: “As time went on, I found it harder to describe, categorise or label myself, in both professional and personal terms, but ending up as a researcher and writer seems about right.” In his spare time Chris enjoyed cycling, listening to music, reading and painting the odd watercolour. He loved travelling and so it was fortuitous that his research and writing interests took him to numerous European countries. He also loved mid-Wales, where he and Jenny raised their three daughters, Nicola, Laura and Anna. He felt it was one of the best places to live, and that his time there had enabled him to meet and work with talented and interesting people. Chris is survived by Jenny, their daughters, Nicola, Laura and Anna, and grandchildren, Siskin, Teal, Gaspard, Henrietta and Penelope, and by his sisters, Val, Diane and me.",News/Education,Christopher Harding obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/24/christopher-harding-obituary
