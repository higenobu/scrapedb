3/10/2022,"Weather conditions disrupted the para Alpine skiing at the Winter Paralympics on Thursday as warm temperatures meant that even with an earlier-than-planned start time, the artificial snow at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre was melting as athletes attempted the technically difficult giant slalom course. Temperatures had been forecast to rise to as high as 23C (73F). Austria’s 16-year-old Johannes Aigner secured his second gold and fourth medal overall of these Games in the men’s visually impaired class, finishing 1.68sec ahead of the defending champion Giacomo Bertagnolli of Italy. The final two runs of Aigner and Bertagnolli pushed Britain’s Neil Simpson into fifth, meaning he couldn’t add to the two medals he has already won in Beijing. And there was heartbreak for the Slovak Marek Kubacka, who finished fourth. Kubacka lost his sight aged nine, and was the only completely blind athlete in the men’s para alpine visually impaired field. In order for him to compete, guide Maria Zatovicova carries a loudspeaker on her that emits a constant sound and her instructions so that he can judge how to follow the course. As a B1 classified athlete, to compensate for the slower speed he skis at, his clock runs at 60.53% of real time. His margin on missing out on the podium ended up being 1.55 seconds. In the men’s standing giant slalom, Santeri Kiiveri of Finland won gold by just 0.04sec from Thomas Walsh of the US, who crossed the line appearing to believe that he had done enough to secure the victory. Britain’s James Whitley finished sixth, moving up from 12th at the halfway stage after putting in a sensational second run which saw him leading the event for a time. On the day only the bronze medallist Arthur Bauchet of France went faster than Whitley’s second run time of 57.3sec. The final event of the para Alpine skiing on Thursday was the men’s sitting giant slalom, with athletes having to cope with a course that was rutted and cut-up from the earlier runs. That led to a series of crashes, including for Jeroen Kampschreur of the Netherlands on the penultimate run, who looked all set for a medal until losing control. Norway’s Jesper Pedersen made it look easy in the end, with a victory by over three seconds. Rene de Silvestro of Italy took silver, Liang Zilu won bronze for the hosts. But it was agony for Argentina’s Enrique Plantey, as Pedersen’s finish pushed him off the podium, and he ended up fourth, missing out on his nation’s first ever Winter Paralympics medal. China have consolidated their lead in the medal table, with 31 medals overall, including 10 golds. Canada remain second with seven golds, and Ukraine third with six. The warm temperatures have caused organisers to reschedule some events on the final three days of the Paralympics. The snowboard banked slalom finals have been moved from Saturday to Friday, and all remaining Alpine skiing events are set to start 90 minutes earlier than previously scheduled. Nevertheless the Games’ vice-president, Yang Shu’an, said: “I can tell you that the snow sports competition in the Winter Paralympics has been very smooth. Athletes, delegations and technical officials are very satisfied. We need to find the window, the best time for our competition schedules. If we encounter the impact of extreme weather, we will immediately start relevant plans.” Conditions can be more controlled in the indoor venues, and at Beijing’s “Ice cube”, with no chance of qualifying for the semi-finals, the British curling team were playing for pride on Thursday. Gary Smith was deputising for the injured David Melrose, but could not help the team avoid a 6-3 defeat to defending champions China in their morning match. That ensured that the hosts will qualify for the next stage, and results elsewhere mean that Sweden and Canada will join them in Friday’s semi-finals. The British rallied to win their final match 8-4 against Latvia, a result that confirmed Slovakia as the last semi-finalist. It was a rest day for the para ice hockey squads on Thursday, with the cancellation of the seventh/eighth place play-off match, as the expulsion of the Russian squad left only seven teams in the tournament. On Friday the Czech Republic and Italy will play off for fifth place, sandwiched between the two semi-finals: Canada v South Korea and China v the USA.",Sport/Sport,Winter Paralympics: athletes battle melting snow in warm Beijing weather,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/10/winter-paralympics-melting-snow-warm-beijing-weather
3/10/2022,"Global warming is changing European birds as we know them, a study has found, but it’s not just the increase in temperature that’s to blame. Researchers have found that garden warblers, for example, are having a quarter fewer chicks, which has huge implications for the species. Chiffchaffs are laying their eggs 12 days earlier. Members of the passerine family are getting smaller, while redstarts are getting larger. Researchers pored over data collected since the mid-90s in Britain and the Netherlands on 60 different species, including the house sparrow, the crested tit, the reed bunting, the bullfinch and the willow warbler. They zero in on how these birds have changed over time with regard to their egg-laying schedules, number of offspring and morphology. Although research has already linked the way passerines – the swallow family – are getting smaller over time to hotter temperatures, scientists weren’t sure whether this was due to heat stress directly or because rising temperatures make it harder to forage. The scientists investigated what proportion of changes over time were linked to warming, and whether warming affected some species or traits more than others, as well as whether other factors unrelated to temperature reinforced these effects. The study, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal last week, found that although more than half of trait changes are linked with rising temperatures – and warming is likely the largest factor driving change over the years – other factors such as urbanisation, pollution, habitat loss and more could also affect shifts in characteristics. “For example, climate change caused chiffchaffs to lay their eggs six days earlier over the last 50 years, but other unknown environmental factors led to an additional six days, meaning in total they now lay their eggs 12 days earlier than they did half a century ago”, said Martijn van de Pol, lead author of the paper from James Cook University in Australia. A change in schedule this big can cause a mismatch between when chicks are born and when food is available for them, breaking the ecosystem balance. On average, up to 57% of overall change over the past decades can be linked to temperature warming, according to the study. Approximately 32% of 60 bird species had changes in body conditions due to temperatures, with an average decrease in size of 0.45% for every celsius increase in heat. About 86% had changes in egg-laying times, and 31% had changes in their number of offspring. “Garden warblers in the UK have experienced a 26% decrease in their average number of offspring over the past half century, which is really concerning for the long-term fate of this species,” said Nina McLean, the lead researcher on the study, from the ANU Research School of Biology. “But only half of this reduction, 13%, can be attributed to climate change.” Not all species are being affected the same way. Some, like the redstart, are clearly increasing their body condition and offspring number. The researchers speculate the variation of how much different species’ traits are changing is most probably up to non-temperature factors. “The study gives a well-grounded explanation for why different species change at such different rates. And it is not to do with temperature sensitivity, but with those other, non-temperature factors,” said Shahar Dubiner, an ecologist at Tel Aviv University, who was not involved in the study. Dubiner’s research has, similarly, found dramatic changes in shape and body condition for over half of Israeli bird species – including many who migrate from Europe, such as storks. Overall, this means warming is likely the largest factor driving trait change, but it’s not the only element at play. Other adjacent factors may play a more prominent role than previously thought – the question is what these other non-temperature factors are, and how they are linked to temperature increase.",News/Environment,"Climate change fundamentally affecting European birds, study shows ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/climate-change-fundamentally-affecting-european-birds-study-shows
3/10/2022,"A red carpet, applause and dozens of blue and white flags were waiting for the first Jewish Ukrainian refugees to arrive in Israel as part of a huge rescue operation triggered by Moscow’s invasion. About 400 people on four flights from Poland, Moldova and Romania landed in Tel Aviv on Sunday, among them 100 children who had been living in a Jewish orphanage in the northern city of Zhytomyr. Most of the new arrivals were visibly relieved to have reached safety; as is tradition, several people touched and kissed the ground after disembarking. Many of the new arrivals had never been to Israel before, and did not imagine they would be making aliyah – the immigration of Jews from the diaspora to the Holy Land – under these circumstances. But as so often in the two weeks since Russia announced the military operation against its neighbour, history appears to be repeating itself. “Israel is not what I expected … Well, I did not really know what to expect,” said 17-year-old computer programmer Yohor Sereda, who fled Kyiv with his father and grandfather. After a dangerous journey to the Polish border, for two days the trio took turns to stand in line and nap in the car before they were allowed to cross. In Warsaw, they were reunited with Sereda’s mother and two younger sisters, who had been on holiday in Egypt when the war broke out. “I just took my laptop and a rucksack of clothes. It was very scary driving out of Kyiv: there were explosions everywhere. It felt like being in a movie,” he said. “But we are definitely the luckier ones.” About 1 million Ukrainian Jews were killed in the Holocaust, but Ukraine and Russia are still home to large Jewish communities. Israeli interior minister Ayelet Shaked said on Tuesday that the state is preparing to take in up to 100,000 Jews from the two countries and other former soviet republics after the onset of Europe’s new war as part of Operation Israel Guarantees. Up to 5,000 non-Jewish Ukrainians will be allowed to come to Israel and another 20,000 who arrived before the fighting will be able to stay temporarily. A heavily criticised policy of forcing Ukrainian nationals or their Israeli hosts to pay a 10,000 shekel (£2,330) bond on arrival at Ben Gurion airport has now been scrapped. The country’s law of return – much reviled by Palestinians, to whom it does not apply – gives people born Jewish, converts, spouses of Jewish people and those with Jewish parents or grandparents the right to move to Israel and acquire Israeli citizenship. Since 1950, Israel has seen several waves of aliyah immigration from countries such as Sudan, Ethiopia and Yemen. Operation Israel Guarantees, however, is an emergency undertaking on a scale not seen since the influx of more than 1 million people after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989. At a four-star hotel next to West Jerusalem’s main bus station on Wednesday, the lobby and restaurant were chaotic: suitcases and bags of clothes were left next to sofas while Ukrainian olim, or migrants, spoke into their mobiles in Ukrainian and Russian to loved ones and lawyers sorting out their paperwork. Small children ran around playing while teenagers made TikTok videos. Immigration ministry employees and volunteer interpreters were on hand to help. But for Igor Fedyaev, from the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia near the contested regions of Donbas and Crimea, the enormity of what has happened has not yet sunk in. While the state will help, he doesn’t yet know where his family will live, or learn Hebrew. Fedyaev was not following the news before 24 February, when the invasion began. As usual, he got up early for his weekly five-a-side football game before work, only to realise that something was wrong: the roads were empty, and the gym was closed. “No one really believed it would happen. It was only the next day we realised we needed to look at escaping,” the 43-year-old father of two said. Fedyaev thought about making aliyah in 2019 after visiting a friend in the Israeli city of Netanya, but forgot about it during the pandemic. The family realised they would need permission from Fedyaev’s first wife in order to take his 16-year-old son, Maksim. While she was keen to help, no lawyers were available to assist with notarising the paperwork, and government databases had shut down. In the end, they had to leave with just a written note from Maksim’s mother before embarking on a 680-mile car journey, making lengthy detours to avoid bombed out towns and roads. “The images we are seeing, it looks like the second world war,” he said. “In the end in every war you see the same sort of things. Most people love their home and the country they were born in. Just because [you are Jewish] it doesn’t mean you want to leave.”",News/Global development,‘No one really believed it would happen’: first Jewish Ukrainian refugees arrive in Israel,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/10/first-jewish-ukrainian-refugees-arrive-in-israel
3/10/2022,"British troops will be sent to help speed up the processing of visas for Ukrainian refugees in Poland but not France, the UK’s armed forces minister has said, amid criticism that people are having to wait too long for help. James Heappey said the Home Office was “reconsidering” current plans for vetting the more than 20,000 people who have fled Ukraine and are hoping to join family members in the UK. After Labour accused the government of failing to learn the lessons of Afghanistan and Tory MPs raised concerns about the UK lagging behind other European countries in its support for refugees, Heappey said some bureaucracy could be stripped away. He said the Home Office believed it could reinforce the visa application centre in northern France without help from the Ministry of Defence (MoD). But Heappey said the MoD had been asked to “supply manpower to Poland, which is the busiest of the visa application centres by some margin” and that the department was “in the process of making that happen”. It came as the PCS union, which represents civil servants including Home Office staff, has called for the government to take urgent action to help Ukrainian refugees after being told the “surge team” boasted about by Priti Patel amounted to just seven people. The union understands the seven volunteers, who have been trained in personal safety, will assist with visa applications in Paris, Warsaw, Rzeszów, Chișinău, Bucharest, Budapest and Prague. On Sunday, visiting the Ukrainian Social Club in Holland Park, London, Patel insisted everything was being done to process as many applications as possible. “I’m surging staff across all application centres across the entire European Union as well as in the border countries such as Poland, where I was the other day and obviously where huge numbers of people are coming through,” she said. Heappey told Sky News: “We’ll supply as many people as they need in order to be able to get the highest number of people processed in the quickest time possible and then the home secretary has got some choices, which I know she’s considering, around how to further change the visa process and what checks might be necessary within it.” Heappey said Patel would consider how to change the process and then “weigh that up against risk”. “A lot of people have made the point this is very different to Afghanistan, this is predominantly a refugee flow of women and children because fighting-age men have remained in Ukraine to fight,” he told BBC Breakfast. “I know the home secretary is very aware of that but she needs to make decisions around how to change visa policy and, crucially, the security checks that are done within visa policy in a way that still gives her the assurance that she needs that at a time of acute competition in Europe between the west and Russia we’re not making the mistake of dropping our guard altogether.” He added: “I know she’ll make the right decision.” The warning that Russian forces were considering a chemical weapons attack was made public on Wednesday night in a bid to deter the Kremlin from following through with it, Heappey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He said that while recent reports of civilians being killed were tragic, “they are but nothing by comparison to the suffering and devastation” that would be caused by a chemical weapons attack. Heappey called it “the most despicable thing that everyone could imagine” and said he was “appalled it is even under consideration”. After a hospital complex in Mariupol was bombed, Heappey said it was “utterly despicable” that Russia had either used its weapons indiscriminately against civilians or deliberately targeted the building. “It is a war crime to not have due regard when you’re targeting for a protected site – like a hospital – when you’re using artillery,” he said.",News/World news,UK troops to help process refugees in Poland – but not France,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/uk-troops-to-help-process-refugees-in-poland-but-not-france
3/10/2022,"Since Russian tanks began rolling over the Ukrainian border, the international media have reported on the plight of foreign couples using paid Ukrainian surrogate mothers. Usually, these articles make scant reference to the surrogates’ wellbeing, instead being written up as breathless tales of derring-do, as plucky couples launch daring raids to bring their babies to safety. The Irish Independent, for example, reported on a County Kerry couple who had brought their son back from Ukraine without making any reference to their surrogate, presumably left postpartum in a war zone. Sometimes, the couples appear indifferent to the plight of the women left behind: one American parent recently wrote a 1,257-word Instagram post about getting her newborn out of Ukraine in which she thanked her gym for keeping her “fit enough” to make the journey and the travel agent who had arranged her hotel, but did not make any reference to the woman who had carried her baby. Olga Danchenko, a surrogacy lawyer from Kyiv who fled to western Ukraine with her family on the first day of the invasion, has been inundated with emails and phone calls. In their worry for their babies, many of her clients forget her own predicament. “The parents who are facing problems getting their babies don’t care about us,” she says. “They say: ‘Hi, Olga, give me the documents.’ ‘Hi, Olga, please draft this.’ ‘Hi, Olga, I need a birth certificate, I need my baby, I signed a contract with you.’ Not a single question about how I am doing.” She sounds exhausted. “We have nightmares during the day and during our dreams at night,” Danchenko says. “Can you imagine? Everything is broken in one day.” Not everyone is focused solely on the babies. “I want to look after our surrogate,” says Annabel (not her real name), a teacher in her 40s from Suffolk. “Not just because she is carrying our baby – but because she is a human being I have formed a connection with.” Annabel and her husband have been trying for a baby for a decade. In that time, they have endured four miscarriages and the death of a prematurely born daughter. Annabel researched surrogacy carefully and picked an agency she felt was ethical. “We didn’t go into this to abuse or take advantage of anyone,” says Annabel. “We entered into an agreement with a person to change our lives – and financially we can change hers.” She considers her surrogate, a 33-year-old mother-of-one who is 12 weeks pregnant, a friend. “We made a connection straight away,” Annabel says. “It’s hard to explain what that feels like, when you meet someone who will change your life.” Even before the war, Yana Belozor, who is 32 and lives in Kyiv, had seen how badly some surrogates are treated. A former surrogate herself, she says the agency she used to work for gave her no emotional support and that she had to chase her salary (most surrogates are paid a lump sum and then a monthly stipend). When she gave birth in 2019, she says the agency sent her to the worst hospital in Kyiv. “I still have nightmares about it,” she shudders. “I was treated like an animal. All the surrogates were placed away from the women having their own biological children and treated differently.” Commercial surrogacy is outlawed in most of the world, although it is legal in some jurisdictions including certain US states. The Ukrainian ombudsman for children has said he believes it should also be banned in Ukraine, where an estimated 2,000 to 2,500 children are born via surrogacy each year. The human rights group La Strada receives 100 calls a year from distressed Ukrainian surrogates. “They send us their contracts so we can assess how legal they are,” says Yuliia Anosova, a lawyer for the organisation who is currently a refugee in Poland. “They’re a total disaster. Often, they’re not even legal.” She recalls one contract in which a woman was forced to relocate mid-pregnancy and told her salary would be docked if she refused. But advocates for Ukrainian surrogacy argue that the overwhelming majority of agencies behave ethically. Before the war, says Danchenko, the system was “amazing” and acted in the “best interests of children and parents”. Belozor became a surrogacy coordinator for another agency, Delivering Dreams, to make sure other women had a better experience than she had. “This is my calling,” she says. Before the war, she was responsible for the wellbeing of 14 pregnant surrogates, mostly in Kyiv. By law, clients – or intended parents, as they are known – must be married, heterosexual and medically unable to have children. These couples, and their surrogates, are caught up in the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe. “Things have got insanely hard,” says Sam Everingham, an Australian fertility lawyer. He has a roster of 70 clients with Ukrainian surrogates at various stages of pregnancy. Natalie Gamble, a British fertility lawyer, is helping 23 British couples, with surrogates ranging from eight to 39 weeks pregnant, get across the border. “In every case, parents are worried about whether surrogates will be able to access medical care and give birth safely, and what will happen if the couples can’t get there when they do,” she says. “Will the babies be left in a war zone with no one to look after them?” Compounding the chaos is the fact that few agencies expected Russia to invade, meaning that they did not make contingency plans. “The situation in Ukraine is stable,” one agency reassured clients on Facebook in late January. “There is no increased or unusual military activity.” Belozor’s American boss, Susan Kersch-Kibler, felt differently. In the second week of February, Kersch-Kibler persuaded 13 of her 14 surrogates, and Belozor, to move to Lviv in western Ukraine. None wanted to go. “They were arguing with me,” Kersch-Kibler says. “It was hard. In the end, I had to sell it like a paid holiday.” Kersch-Kibler offered to move the surrogates’ families with them, but only two of the surrogates, and Belozor, brought their children. They thought they would be going home soon and didn’t want to uproot their families. For now, these surrogates, at least, are safe. But, under Ukrainian martial law, male citizens aged between 18 and 60 are not permitted to leave the country. Surrogates may soon face a terrible dilemma: evacuate and leave their partners and even children behind, or remain in a country under attack. To compound their worry, their family and friends back home are not safe. Belozor’s husband is a firefighter in Kyiv. “For 11 days, he hasn’t been able to change his clothes or take a shower,” she says. “All day long, he is inhaling smoke.” Despite her worries, Belozor keeps working. “My biggest job is to keep the women all emotionally stable,” she says. If they start to feel anxious, she takes them to a doctor, to confirm the baby is OK. The day before we speak, Belozor’s best friend from childhood, Alexi Semenyk, was shot in the head by Russian forces near Luhansk. He was 35. Like many Ukrainians, Belozor is desperate for western countries to implement a no-fly zone over the country. “The world needs to help,” she says, sobbing. “There won’t be any peace in this world, because Putin is so sick and unpredictable and dangerous.” Annabel’s surrogate and her son are now safe in Poland. The journey took three days. “She told us when she got on the train, but then her battery died,” says Annabel. “I was literally sick with fear for her and her son. You’re watching the news to see if there have been any attacks on trains, or at the border. When I got her message to say she’d crossed the border, I cried.” Annabel hopes that her surrogate will be able to join her in the UK – if that is what she wants. “We want her here so we can look after her,” Annabel says. “And not just until the baby is born. We want to look after her until she can go home, or wherever she chooses for home to be. If she chooses to stay here, then we will help establish her here.” Annabel and her husband will drive to Poland to collect their surrogate and her son, if they can get them emergency travel documents and she is willing. However, there are no legal routes for surrogates and their families to resettle in the UK. Ukrainians are allowed entry only if they have family members already resident. (A mooted “humanitarian route” has become mired in confusion.) By contrast, Ireland has removed entry requirements for Ukrainian refugees. “This is a small group of women who are carrying British children,” says Gamble. “The UK has a responsibility to protect them.” Gamble wrote to the home secretary recently, asking her to make provision for surrogates who are pregnant with British children, and their families, to come to the UK. The Home Office has not responded. Relatively speaking, Annabel is lucky. Some non-Ukrainian couples have lost contact with their surrogates. “I’m totally heartbroken and losing it,” writes one on a Facebook group. “The agency … is not responding to my emails … I do not have direct contact with the surrogate so I’m unable to reach her. Not sure if she’s OK. Would like to do anything I can to help her and her daughter.” Fabiana Marcela Quaini, an Argentinian lawyer, knows of one client who has lost contact with their surrogate, who is due to give birth next week. Kersch-Kibler and her team are assisting surrogates and parents contracted to other agencies. “We’re trying to help anyone in this situation,” she says. “The parents are desperate to contact the surrogates. One surrogate got in touch to say that her agency was trying to make her get an abortion and she couldn’t get in contact with the intended parents.” Kersch-Kibler understands the parents’ despair. All of the couples using Ukrainian surrogates have tried for years to have families. “This is their last chance,” she says. “For them, that child is precious beyond all words. It’s hard for them to cope with the pictures on TV, knowing their child is in the same country.” Some clients are catastrophising. “I only sleep a few hours a night,” says Jorge, a 48-year-old lawyer from Buenos Aires. He was in a WhatsApp chat with 60 people in the same situation, but left the group. “The group was making me really crazy,” he says. “I can’t avoid watching the news, but the group was too much.” Jorge and his wife tried unsuccessfully to have a baby for a decade. Their surrogate, Katerina, is four months pregnant. She is in Kyiv with her husband and sons and is unable to find a safe route out of the city. “I can’t imagine how a pregnant woman can live in a war with explosions,” says Jorge. “For this reason, I’d prefer for her to come to Argentina, but I can’t decide for her. She’s free. She’s not a slave.” Because Katerina doesn’t speak Spanish and Jorge doesn’t speak Ukrainian, they usually communicate via the agency, but Jorge is trying not to hassle staff there. “I don’t want to disturb them by calling all the time,” he says. “They’re in a war and I have respect. I know the men at the agency have to take up guns to defend their country.” Dmytro Pugach, a 48-year-old fertility lawyer from Kyiv who is coordinating the evacuation of dozens of surrogates, is one of these men. “I have to combine work for life and work for death,” he emails. “I’m helping pregnant surrogates to deliver safely, and fighting in the territorial defence. My Kalashnikov stands beside me as I type this.” Surrogates are being allowed to exit Ukraine with minimal documentation. But this exodus has significant legal ramifications. Under Ukrainian law, intended parents are automatically viewed as the legal parents of children born via surrogacy, but this does not apply in the UK, Ireland or much of Europe. “Some embassies are friendly to surrogacy, but in Austria and Germany surrogacy is not permitted,” says Danchenko. “Parents and surrogates need documents that it’s impossible to provide, as administrative offices are closed.” Parents don’t understand why they can’t fly their babies home without documents. “They are aggressive,” says Danchenko. “They cry. They say: ‘Give me my baby.’ I ask about their documents and they don’t care. I’m a lawyer. What am I supposed to do without documents? That is human trafficking.” Of course, not everyone can leave. One of Pugach’s surrogates is in a town that has been blockaded by Russian forces. She is trapped. Should she need medical attention, her options may be limited. Hospitals and clinics have been attacked. A maternity hospital in the city of Zhytomyr was bombed on 1 March; a Kyiv maternity hospital was hit the day after. On 9 March, a maternity and children’s ward at a hospital in Mariupol was reportedly destroyed by a Russian air strike. At the time of publication, fatalities were not confirmed, but unverified reports indicated that children were buried under the rubble. It is a terrible situation for all involved – and unlikely to be resolved soon. “I pray for the health of Katerina, her sons and her family,” says Jorge. He can’t stop thinking about the last time he saw her, in Kyiv. She was walking to a tram stop, holding a box of chocolates. “I will always remember that image,” Jorge says. “Kyiv was beautiful and peaceful. Now, on the news, I can’t believe what I see.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Will the babies be left in a war zone?’ The terrified Ukrainian surrogates – and the parents waiting for their children,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/10/will-the-babies-be-left-in-a-war-zone-the-terrified-ukrainian-surrogates-and-the-parents-waiting-for-their-children
3/10/2022,"Roman Abramovich’s hopes of selling Chelsea have been put on hold after the Russian oligarch was sanctioned by the UK government. Abramovich’s UK assets have been frozen as part of the UK’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In a document published by the government on Thursday morning, Chelsea’s owner was identified as “a pro-Kremlin oligarch” and was said to be “associated with a person who is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, namely Vladimir Putin, with whom Abramovich has had a close relationship for decades.” The document stated that Abramovich has had a close relationship with Putin “for decades” and that the association has led to him benefitting financially. The government said: “This association has included obtaining a financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the Government of Russia. This includes tax breaks received by companies linked to Abramovich, buying and selling shares from and to the state at favourable rates, and the contracts received in the run-up to the 2018 World Cup. Therefore, Abramovich has received preferential treatment and concessions from Putin and the government of Russia.” Abramovich has repeatedly denied that he is linked to Putin or the Russian state, or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned. The measures mean that Abramovich cannot sell Chelsea or invest in the club. The 55-year-old put the club up for sale last week and had been hoping for a deal to go through quickly. There has been interest in the club from several parties. Chelsea, who were bought by Abramovich in 2003, now face an uncertain future. The European champions have been given a special licence to continue operating, but they will do so with restrictions hanging over them. They cannot sell tickets, no merchandise sales are allowed and they cannot sign players or hand out new contracts.

3/10/2022,"The Labor senator Kimberley Kitching has died suddenly of a suspected heart attack aged 52, prompting tributes from across the political divide. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said on Thursday night: “The Labor family is in shock tonight at the tragic news that our friend and colleague senator Kimberley Kitching has died suddenly in Melbourne. My sincere condolences to her family. Kimberley will be missed by us all.” The Labor family is in shock tonight at the tragic news that our friend and colleague Senator Kimberley Kitching has died suddenly in Melbourne. My sincere condolences to her family. Kimberley will be missed by us all. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, also offered his condolences, describing Kitching’s death as “a deep and terrible shock”. Morrison paid tribute to Kitching as “a serious parliamentarian who had a deep interest in Australia’s national security”. “She demonstrated that her passion for her country was always greater than any partisan view. She clearly loved her country and it genuinely showed,” Morrison said in a statement. “Senator Kitching was a practising Catholic and we witnessed her authentic faith in the life of the parliament. She followed her conscience and was fearless and I admired that.” Deeply saddened at the news Victorian Labor Senator Kimberley Kitching passed away suddenly today, aged just 52. Our deepest condolences go to her family, friends and colleagues. Kitching, a Victorian senator since 2016, was one of the driving forces for Australia to adopt Magnitsky-style laws allowing the country to introduce targeted sanctions against foreign officials. She celebrated the passage of those laws late last year. Bill Shorten, the former Labor leader and a close friend of the senator, said in a statement: “With a desolate heart I share the news that Kimberley Kitching has passed away.” “Kimberley suffered a heart problem Thursday evening in Melbourne and passed soon after,” he said. Shorten said her death was “an immense loss to Labor and the nation”. “As well as her innumerable accolades she has been a wonderful friend to myself, my wife Chloe and our family. To know Kimberley was to be touched not just by her serene intellect but her incredible warmth and vivacity.” Shorten offered his condolences to her husband, Andrew Landeryou, her family and loved ones. The deputy Labor leader and fellow Victorian, Richard Marles, said he had known Kitching as a friend for more than 30 years and “words cannot express the sadness of this moment”. “Kimberley knew what she stood for and she brought a clarity of thought to her role in the Senate that was rare, she was a fierce advocate for all that she believed in,” Marles said. Kitching was a lawyer, Melbourne city councillor and union leader before she made the move to Canberra. George Brandis, Australia’s high commissioner to the UK and a former Senate colleague, said Kitching was a brilliant senator whose “commitment to upholding and securing Australia’s interests were unquestioned”.

GB Kitching, as chair of the Senate’s Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, had been leading an inquiry into Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan. She was a foreign policy hawk who was a prominent supporter of a harder line against Beijing. Together with Liberal senator James Paterson, Kitching was the Australian co-chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a group of legislators from around the world who have called for democratic countries to rethink the way they engage with China. The alliance calls for democracies to mount “a common defence of shared principles” and to stand up for human rights in their relationships with China. Last month, Kitching hit the headlines after using parliamentary privilege to name the alleged “puppeteer” behind a foreign interference plot foiled by Asio.

3/10/2022,"Russian oil is funding the invasion of Ukraine and the murder of innocent people, just as money from the sale of blood diamonds fuelled brutal civil war in Africa. We must cut off this funding at source. This trade can and must be stopped through pressure brought by you, the consumer, on companies and governments. Vladimir Putin sells 5m barrels of crude oil per day, a large share of which goes to Europe. Today, as EU leaders gather to discuss the crisis, we call on people everywhere to boycott Russian oil now. We are receiving great support from many governments and people. They are taking in our refugees, they are sending us food and medicine, and they voted against Putin’s war at the United Nations. On Tuesday, the Biden administration agreed to ban all US imports of Russian oil and gas. But political leaders in Germany, Italy, the UK, and some other countries are afraid to impose an immediate embargo. They are afraid that oil prices will go up, and that their voters won’t understand why, or will be too angry to care. You, the public, know better. You are already on the streets and across social media expressing support for Ukraine. We appreciate all the videos sending the clear message that you are appalled by the horror Putin has brought. But your governments still fear that if they embargo Russian oil, you will hold it against them. If there is a boycott of Russian oil, a plan can be put in place to address short-term supply issues. In the longer term, it is obviously now a national security imperative for all countries to speedily move away from their reliance on fossil fuels. What we are requesting will only accelerate the transition needed to address the climate crisis. Yet despite indiscriminate murder happening in Ukrainian streets and pledges of action from the most powerful world leaders at Cop26 in November, European governments still hesitate. If we cannot end the age of fossil fuels in the face of civilian slaughter and the destruction of our planet, what will it take? Let’s make it easy for them. We are organising a coalition to track the tankers that transport Russian oil and tell you where they are. The Russians will try to hide this information, but we will tell you where the ships are. Last week, Shell bought a shipment of Russian oil, reportedly because it was available at a discount of just under $30 per barrel. The public backlash was immediate, and on 8 March, Shell pledged to no longer buy Russian oil. We need all oil companies to do the same. These companies may not listen to the cries of Ukrainian children, but they will listen to you, their customers. Most oil is used for transportation, including for personal cars, lorries and planes. Please do not buy petrol or diesel from any company that is refining Russian oil. Do not fly on an airline that uses jet fuel made from Russian oil. Demand of your leaders that no Russian oil is offloaded in your ports. Do not insure their cargo, do not lease ships to them and do not transport any oil or refined products inside your countries. Please do not conduct any personal or corporate financial transaction with Russian oil companies, their managers, or owners. This is all blood oil and blood money. Any executive who makes the decision to buy blood oil or any products derived from blood oil will damage their brand and destroy shareholder value – anyone that incompetent should be fired immediately. We will make this point to boards of directors and shareholders everywhere. We will also help bring lawsuits, on behalf of innocent Ukrainians who have suffered irreparable harm, against any individuals or companies that profit from blood oil. To the extent permissible by law in all relevant jurisdictions, on behalf of the dead, injured, displaced and traumatised, we will pursue immediate injunctions and maximum damages from all parties who now help Russia. Putin thinks he is strong because Russia is the second-largest oil exporter in the world. But he is weak because he has put himself in your hands and you are angry because he is terrorising Ukrainian civilians and threatening the world. We are standing up to Putin and we will win. Our soldiers are well-trained and millions of our citizens are taking up arms. There is no way for Putin to take over and control a country with more than 40 million angry people, all shouting, “Go home!” But many Ukrainians, including thousands and thousands of children, are suffering every hour of every day. Unarmed civilians are being bombarded constantly. They hide underground. They do not have enough food or water. Many lack the medicines they need. More than 50 children have died in tragic circumstances. Thousands of lives hang in the balance. The movement against blood diamonds changed the world, but it took years. Greed is very powerful. But we, the people, are more powerful and when we focus our anger, we can achieve anything and stop anyone. We must end this war. You can help us. Tell your governments: not in my name. Boycott Russian oil now.
