3/29/2022,"Just months after Akshata Murthy was born in April 1980, she was sent to live with her paternal grandparents after her parents moved hundreds of miles away to Mumbai for work. “Your mother and I were young then and struggling to find our feet in our careers,” her father wrote in a letter to Akshata published as part of a book written by her mother titled Legacy; Letters from eminent parents to their daughter. “Two months after your birth in Hubli [a city near Goa], we brought you to Mumbai, but discovered quickly enough that it was a difficult task to nurture a child and manage careers side by side. So, we decided that you would spend the initial years of your life with your grandparents in Hubli.” Her father, NR Narayana Murthy, a young computer programmer who would go on to launch IT services company Infosys and become billionaire, said leaving Akshata behind was one of the hardest decisions he had had to make. “Every weekend, I would take the plane to Belgaum [a nearby airport] and then hire a car to Hubli. It was very expensive, but I couldn’t do without seeing you.” Her mother, Sudha Menon, a computer scientist and engineer, was the first female engineer to work for India’s then largest car maker, part of the Tata conglomerate, and is now a philanthropist working to improve public healthcare. When Akshata did join her parents, and later her brother Rohan, in Mumbai, life might not have been as relaxed as it was with her grandparents in Hubli. Sudha “decided early on that there would be no TV in our home so that there would be time for things like studying, reading, discussions, and meeting friends”, according to the book. Every evening, from 8pm to 10pm, was dedicated to “pursuits that brought the family together in a productive environment”. For Akshata and Rohan, that meant homework, while their parents “read books on history, literature, physics, mathematics, and engineering, or did any office work”. As the family became increasingly rich, her parents eschewed hiring a private car and driver to take her school, preferring to stick with the “regular autorickshaw” where she made “great friends with the ‘rickshaw uncle’”. Murthy went to the private liberal Claremont McKenna College in California, where she studied economics and French, before moving to the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles. She worked for Deloitte and Unilever before studying for an MBA at Stanford University. It was at Stanford that she met Rishi Sunak, who had won a prestigious Fulbright scholarship. Within four years, they were married in a two-day ceremony in Bengaluru attended by cricketing royalty, including the Indian spinner Anil Kumble and the family of Rahul Dravid, the former captain of the national cricket team. Murthy said he was “little sad and jealous” when Akshata first told him of her new life partner. “But when I met Rishi and found him to be all that you had described him to be – brilliant, handsome and, most importantly, honest – l understood why you let your heart be stolen.” After Stanford, she joined a Dutch clean technology incubator fund in San Francisco as marketing director in 2007, but left quickly to start her own fashion label; Akshata Designs. “I understand that there may be some curiosity around what I’m doing given my parents’ achievements, but I hope that one day this business is able to stand on its own feet and I’m able to speak on its merit rather than anything else,” she told the Times of India in 2009 when she founded the business. “This is my passion and I couldn’t imagine being engaged in anything else but the business of this venture.” The business, however, collapsed within three years. Money comes in from her 0.91% stake in Infosys, which is valued at about $900m (£690m), making Murthy richer than the Queen (£365m). The couple also own London-based Catamaran Ventures UK, which invests in startups “with the view to future capital growth and income distributions”. Sunak transferred his shares to her just before entering parliament, and she is now the sole owner. She has direct shareholdings in at least six other UK companies, including gentlemen’s outfitters New & Lingwood, which measures Etonians for their tailcoats and sells silk dressing gowns for £2,500 each. Murthy also holds shares in a UK business that operates Jamie Oliver’s Pizzeria, Jamie’s Italian and Wendy’s outlets in India, the nanny agency Koru Kids, and gyms operator Digme Fitness, where she is a director. Both New & Lingwood and Digme furloughed staff during the pandemic. Soroco, a software company co-founded by her brother, lists Murthy as a director of its UK arm. Murthy and Sunak own at least four homes in the UK and California, including a five-bedroom mews house in Kensington, valued at almost £7m, and a £1.5m Georgian mansion set in 12 acres in Sunak’s North Yorkshire constituency, as well as a flat on the Old Brompton Road in west London. They also own a Santa Monica beach penthouse valued at £5.5m, which the property developer describes as having “stunning views of the Santa Monica mountains” and where you “wake up to the sound of waves crashing against the shore”.",News/Politics,Akshata Murthy: who is Rishi Sunak’s wife?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/28/akshata-murthy-who-is-rishi-sunaks-wife
3/29/2022,"Polly Toynbee writes about Rishi Sunak’s cynical spring statement (I’ve covered countless Tory mini-budgets. The cruelty of this one shocked even me, 25 March). The day after it, my wife and I delivered a couple’s first-ever food bank parcel. Their door was wide open so as not to miss the delivery and they greeted us with the words: “We were down to our last tin of beans.” Week after week we deliver to people who try everything to make ends meet to provide food and heat for their families. Many are working but not earning enough to meet basic needs; some are looking for work that doesn’t exist; some are casualties of a bureaucratic and punitive benefits system that is unable to respond to changes in people’s circumstances. These are the people who have no savings or resources to call on when prices rise and incomes fall. These people are part of my community and the very people whom the privileged and wealthy people who run this government should safeguard. The failure to do so is not just negligent but cruel.Peter RiddleWirksworth, Derbyshire  With energy and food inflation at nearly 30% and 5% compared with 2021, many people can afford neither healthy ingredients nor the fuel to cook them (Food bank users declining potatoes as cooking costs too high, says Iceland boss, 23 March). As a result, poorer Britons are pushed into eating nutritionally inferior, fat-heavy convenience foods. We’ve been here before. During the industrial revolution, according to the historian David Zylberberg, the high cost of fuel “forced inhabitants of many southern regions to abandon home cooking”. Deprived of the means to cook, Britain’s industrial workforce came to subsist on a miserable diet of white bread and sweet tea, not because they didn’t know how to prepare healthier meals, but because they could not afford to. It’s deeply dismaying that the inequalities in today’s Britain are in so many ways returning us to the early 19th century.Prof Rebecca EarleDepartment of history, University of Warwick  There has been much talk about raising standards in education. When will this government realise that it doesn’t matter how many more hours they spend in school or completing endless tests, children will not be able to concentrate and learn while they are hungry, cold or sleepy? Until the bigger picture of child poverty is addressed, higher standards in certain areas of the country will never be reached, despite the best efforts of our overworked, underpaid teachers. What a pity that the chancellor ignored the opportunity to begin this process in his spring statement.Christine KearnsBirmingham  Polly Toynbee is right to criticise Rishi Sunak’s failure to aid our poorest. But she makes no mention of that sacred cow – inheritance – which could be milked to provide sustenance. The “give it away early” period should be increased from seven to 15 years, and the threshold lowered substantially. Our wealth is even more unevenly distributed than our incomes and provides scope for redistribution.Alan FairsBewdley, Worcestershire  I do not understand the surprise at Rishi Sunak’s meagre offering to the worst-off (Rishi Sunak tackled over failure to help poorest families, 24 March). I am 27, and for as long as I can remember, the national conversation has been one of “scroungers”, “single mums on benefits” and rabid demands from the usual suspects in the media to make these people suffer. Why should it be surprising, then, that the present government is following the precedent of disregarding those at the bottom? This is not a new policy. Alternatives have been offered and rejected.

The fifth series is set in the 1990s, and its antihero, the corrupt politician Sir Joseph Olinska, visits Moscow to push through a purchase of the Russian medical drugs company in partnership with his oligarch friend. He is roughed up by a character called Lebedev, and there is mention of an up-and-coming politician by the name of Putin. The message of the series is that the webs of corruption cover long periods of time, that many players who are bound in by their own actions become ever more deeply enmeshed, and that none of our institutions is above suspicion.

There are so many hours in the day and no legislation by any government can change this. The challenge is to use the hours more efficiently. Our habits have allowed us to get out of bed some hours after sunrise, and then go to bed some hours after sunset. This wastes a lot of electricity to light our homes when we should be letting the sun do it for free. We just need to go to bed earlier and get up earlier.

3/29/2022,"Asda faces a legal wrangle with Waitrose after unveiling a new £70m cut-price grocery range with a similar name to its pricier rival’s established discount brand. Waitrose, which has used the Essential Waitrose brand for about 13 years, said it had sent a legal letter to its bigger rival over its new brand name Just Essentials by Asda on Monday. “We were surprised to hear that Asda is launching an essentials range as the Essential Waitrose brand has been in use since 2009 and has built up a strong reputation for value, quality and higher welfare standards in that time,” said a spokesperson for Waitrose, which part of the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership. “As we’ve also protected the name as a trade mark, we have raised this with Asda and are awaiting a response.” Asda, which was criticised by food campaigner Jack Monroe over shortages of its cheapest items, is launching the cut-price range of 300 items from May after announcing a 42% surge in profits. It will cover household essentials such as toilet roll and shampoo as well as fresh meat, fish and poultry, frozen items and cupboard staples such as tinned tomatoes. The retailer, which said it has hiked supermarket prices by about 5% as it wrestles with rising food inflation, said the full range would be available in all its 581 stores and online and would eventually replace its existing Smart Price budget range. In its first full year of ownership by petrol station tycoons Mohsin and Zuber Issa, Asda said sales rose just 0.6% to £20.4bn in the year to 31 December 2021 but profits swelled 42% to £693.1m, which it said was mainly down to cutting pandemic costs. The supermarket struggled to beat strong sales in 2020 when families were forced to stock up for home cooking as restaurants, bars, cafes and many workplace and school canteens were closed for long periods. Asda said its uptick in sales for the year was driven by strong trade in homewares, garden kit and clothing after pandemic-related disruption in 2020. However, the retailer is also facing increasing competition from fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl, which continue to open stores and have stolen Asda’s crown as the cheapest option on many groceries. Asda’s sales were particularly poor during the busy Christmas period, falling 2.9% in the final three months of the year on the same period a year earlier. That performance compares with a 0.6% rise in sales at Tesco and strong growth by Aldi and Lidl over a similar period but is better than rival Sainsbury’s 5.3% fall in sales over the Christmas quarter. Mohsin Issa said he hoped its new cut-price range would help Asda overtake Sainsbury’s to reclaim its position as the UK’s second-biggest supermarket, behind much bigger rival Tesco. “We understand that customers are increasingly worried about the cost of living and want help to keep their grocery bills in check, while still being able to buy healthy and nutritious food for their families,” he said in a statement. “Our new ‘Just Essentials’ range has been specifically designed with this in mind, combining our lowest prices with a much larger and more diverse range of great value products to meet all household needs.” The Issa brothers, who made their fortunes building the EG Group petrol station empire, bought a majority stake in Asda in a £6.8bn deal that completed last year. US retailer Walmart, which had controlled Asda since 1999, retains a minority stake and a seat on the board. The Issas have opened 31 Asda convenience stores in partnership with EG Group and have also injected their food service brands including Leon and Cinnabon to 17 Asda stores as a way to increase their attractiveness and use up spare space.",News/Business,Asda faces legal wrangle with Waitrose after investing £70m in budget range,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/28/asda-invests-70m-in-new-just-essentials-budget-range

3/29/2022,"An iron maxim of war is to imagine what your enemy most wants you to do, and not to do it. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is floundering. He has lied to the Russian people to justify it. He has told them it is not Ukraine but Nato and the west that seek their defeat and his overthrow. That is why they must support him in his fight. To a large extent they have done so. Nato has so far been scrupulous in not playing Putin’s game. It has stood aloof from active military support to Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy, as have its individual member countries. For all the war-dancing, defence-boosting and cheerleading in western capitals, Nato discipline has held. This is a conflict between Russia and its neighbour, its origins deep in east Europe’s histories and insecurities. Nothing could therefore be more dangerous than to agree with Putin’s narrative, to accept the revival of cold war antagonism between Russia and the west. Moral and logistical support for Kyiv is one thing, Nato planes in the air and boots on the ground are another. The latter would lead to a reckless and possibly uncontrollable escalation of the confrontation. Cue America’s president, Joe Biden. Last week he arrived in Europe pumped up on belligerent rhetoric. In January he had suggested a Russian advance into Ukraine would constitute no more than “a minor incursion”. In March, he is telling American troops in Poland that they would soon see brave Ukrainians defying Russia “when you are there”. America would “respond in kind” to a chemical weapon attack on Ukraine, one that has not been threatened. Biden went further, calling Putin a “butcher”, one who “cannot remain in power”. He thus broke a longstanding protocol against the west demanding regime changes abroad (except when instigated by America). These remarks were similar to Biden’s “commitment” last October that America would “protect Taiwan” in the event of an invasion by Beijing, a flat rejection of Washington’s careful and longstanding ambiguity on the subject. In all these cases, the White House and state department have instantly denied that Biden meant what he said. But the damage was done. Footage of him making the remarks is unnerving. What seemed at first a folksy ad-lib suggested a man not fully the master of his tongue, let alone his brief. Moscow broadcast Biden’s aggressive intent to the Russian people. France and Britain felt they had to reassert their non-engagement – inevitably dismaying the Ukrainians. Nato’s delicate unity had been undermined. Putin grasped eagerly at the reinforcement of his claim. The response to Biden’s speech of the veteran American diplomat, Richard Haass, was serious. “The fact that it was so off-script in some ways made it worse,” he said, as it indicated what his true beliefs are. It also suggests a split in the American administration’s view of the conflict, with the president already committed to a wider war. The prospect is thus of the world’s principal power blocs led by two men both with fingers on the nuclear button but with an apparently uncertain hold on reality. It is precisely the “madness” scenario foreseen by alarmist strategists of the 20th-century power struggle. The Ukraine war is clearly at a turning point; at the end of its beginning and possibly even at the beginning of its end. This is a moment of maximum uncertainty. Fighting on the ground is mostly stalemated. Ukraine’s allies have given almost as much logistical support as they dare, while avoiding risk of direct contact with the Russians. They know that the mere prospect of Nato troops on the battlefield would validate Putin’s narrative. It would risk unleashing an escalation in targets and weaponry. Ukraine would become a bloodbath, while Europe would confront a 1914-style triggering of alliance obligations. Zelenskiy has so far been masterful in mobilising his nation’s defence. He has shown what military analysts have never understood but has emerged from recent wars: that hi-tech weaponry and air superiority can be no match against simple fighters, even amateurs, with a cause in their hearts and a homeland at stake. Now, however, Zelenskiy must be no less masterful. He must negotiate the compromises that are inevitable if Ukraine’s cities are not to be utterly destroyed and Putin’s armed forces are to agree to withdraw. Remarks out of Kyiv in advance of this week’s peace talks in Istanbul seem aware of this realpolitik. In essence, Zelenskiy suggests a reversion to the 2015 Minsk 2 settlement. This acknowledged de facto Russia’s aversion – now reinforced – to any Nato advance to its border with Ukraine. It accepted the country’s virtual “Finlandisation”. But Minsk also agreed substantial but unrealised autonomy for the Donbas region, any refusal of which would seem to condemn the war to ongoing hell. The status of this autonomy will clearly be crucial. The old industrial districts of Donbas have been the source of anarchy within Ukraine in recent years.. Such regional dissent has blighted the stability of half the nations of Europe over past decades – currently including Spain, France and the UK. Centralist regimes may decry them and treat separatism as an archaic curse. There is nothing unique about Ukraine, but today it proves the poison of centralism when left to fester. Finding a constitutional path to autonomy for the Crimean and Donbas regions of Ukraine must hold the key to peace. Somewhere in the murky waters of devolved government, confederalism and “sovereignty-lite” lies a new future for this desperate corner of Europe. Much of Donbas has already been autonomous for eight years since 2014 and some recognition of this must surely be the price of peace. Fixing its border – and guaranteeing its acceptance – will be challenging. The last thing this diplomatic tightrope needs is to find itself a plaything of western domestic politics. Two Nato leaders, Biden and Britain’s Boris Johnson, are populists unschooled in the art of diplomacy. Both face electoral hostility at home. Both are prancing along Ukraine’s frontier beating their chests in parodies of Churchillian machismo. The bombast is not deterring Putin, but it strengthens his existential narrative and raises the war’s global profile. This must make him less inclined to accept the cost of any concession in defeat. Another maxim of war is to allow your enemy a bridge over which to retreat. That bridge is one of constitutional compromise in Donbas. It is an acceptance that this is Ukraine’s dispute with Putin, not the west’s with Russia. For the sake of a wider peace it must be kept that way.

3/29/2022,"Canada’s most populous province has signed a long-awaited deal with the federal government for subsidized childcare, paving the way for a nationwide plan that Justin Trudeau hailed as a “historic moment”. Unveiling the plan on Monday, the prime minister pledged that fees will eventually drop to C$10 a day by 2026, but experts caution that the plan must reckon with the reality of chronic staff shortages, fierce demand for limited spaces and murky funding agreements. Trudeau and Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, announced billions in funding for the province, part of a broader multibillion-dollar package offered to all provinces and territories. “Childcare is becoming a reality for all Canadians,” said Trudeau. Ford, who had held out for nearly a year for more money from Ottawa, is the last leader to sign on to the national childcare plan. But Monday’s announcement is essentially the amount of money offered to Ontario last year. “It’s unfortunate that it took this long, because the longer it takes to make the agreements, the longer it’s going to take to implement,” said Sarah Kaplan, director of the Institute for Gender and the Economy at the University of Toronto. “Families in Ontario have been missing out on the progress that could have been made.” Ontario has the highest childcare costs in the country; in Toronto families often pay more than C$1,600 a month for childcare. The new deal would, on average, cut fees in half by the end of 2022. Other provinces that signed agreements earlier have seen fees drop sharply. But Kaplan and others worry the early figures from deals announced by other provinces suggest they are not yet on track to reach their goal by 2026. “Unless something changes, you’ll still see low-income families paying upwards of 40% of their income, for childcare. That is not ‘affordable’,” she said. Additionally, Canada is struggling to train, hire and retain early childhood educators, many of whom are leaving the field amid frustrations over low pay. Without enough staff in childcare centres, families will be left waiting for space, or pushed to higher-cost options. For decades, a nationwide affordable childcare system has proven elusive for the governing Liberals. A previous attempt to introduce such a scheme was scuttled by an election defeat in 2006, but Canada’s decentralized governance system, in which provinces hold immense power, has also been blamed for hampering the rollout of a national plan. “At the end of the day, the federal government’s hands are tied and families are beholden to what provinces choose to do and if they are really going to take childcare seriously,” said Kaplan. Quebec implemented low-cost childcare in 1997 and economists say the province demonstrated the costs were easily recovered by a sharp increase in workforce participation, especially among women. When she announced the aim of nationwide affordable childcare last year, deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland pointed to the effects the coronavirus pandemic was having on women in the workforce. “Covid has brutally exposed something women have long known: without childcare, parents – usually mothers – can’t work,” she said, calling it an “investment worth making”. Affordable childcare has become an important progressive issue during the pandemic, and in the United States, Joe Biden has tried – and failed – to include similar efforts in his administration’s proposed Build Back Better legislation. In both Canada and the US, there is a growing effort to recast childcare as both an investment in infrastructure, similar to roads and bridges, and as a ‘job creator’. “We told Minister Freeland, and all the other ministers involved, that were was a limited window of opportunity too, because the pandemic has opened people’s eyes to these issues. Luckily, they took it,” said Kaplan. “And Canada should be commended for making progress now. But honestly, this should have happened 20 years ago.”",News/World news,Canada’s subsidized childcare edges closer as Ontario finally signs on,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/28/subsidized-childcare-canada-ontario-signs-on
3/29/2022,"A four-legged robot called Spot has been deployed to wander around the ruins of ancient Pompeii, identifying structural and safety issues while delving underground to inspect tunnels dug by relic thieves. The dog-like robot is the latest in a series of technologies used as part of a broader project to better manage the archaeological park since 2013, when Unesco threatened to add Pompeii to a list of world heritage sites in peril unless Italian authorities improved its preservation. Spot, made by the US-based Boston Dynamics, is capable of inspecting even the smallest of spaces while “gathering and recording data useful for the study and planning of interventions”, park authorities said. The aim, they added, is to “improve both the quality of monitoring of the existing areas, and to further our knowledge of the state of progress of the works in areas undergoing recovery or restoration, and thereby to manage the safety of the site, as well as that of workers.” Until Spot came along, no technology of its kind had been developed for archaeological sites, according to Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the director of Pompeii archaeological park. Park authorities have also experimented with a flying laser scanner capable of conducting 3D scans across the 66-hectare (163-acre) site. Zuchtriegel said: “Technological advances in the world of robotics, in the form of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, have produced solutions and innovations typically associated with the industrial and manufacturing world, but which until now had not found an application within archaeological sites due to the heterogeneity of environmental conditions, and the size of the site.” Spot will also be tested for use in underground tunnels made by tombaroli, or tomb raiders, who for years made a fortune by digging their way into the ruins and stealing relics to sell on to art traffickers around the world. The thieves have been less successful since 2012, when Italy’s art police intensified a crackdown on culture crime, although tunnels are still being found in the area around Pompeii. “Often the safety conditions within the tunnels dug by grave robbers are extremely precarious, and so the use of a robot could signify a breakthrough that would allow us to proceed with greater speed and in total safety,” said Zuchtriegel.",News/Technology,Robot dog called in to help manage Pompeii,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/28/robot-dog-to-help-manage-pompeii-spot-tunnels-thieves
3/29/2022,"Social media may affect the wellbeing of girls and boys at different ages, according to research that raises the prospect of windows of vulnerability in adolescence. Psychologists found that girls who increased their time on social media between the ages of 11 and 13 were less satisfied with their lives one year later, with the same trend playing out in boys aged 14 to 15. The researchers found no link between social media and wellbeing at other ages, except at 19 years old, when higher usage was again followed by a drop in life satisfaction for both sexes. “We find there are certain ages, which differ between the sexes, when social media more substantially predicts life satisfaction,” said Dr Amy Orben, an experimental psychologist and first author on the study at the University of Cambridge. The researchers embarked on the work in the hope of shedding light on whether the rise of social media has played a role in increasing levels of mental health problems in young people. According to the charity Young Minds, the number of children aged five to 16 with a suspected mental health problem rose by 50% between 2017 and 2021, suggesting about five children in every classroom are now affected. Orben and her colleagues analysed data from 84,000 UK individuals aged between 10 and 80 years old who enrolled on either the Understanding Society study or the Millennium Cohort study. These captured information on people’s mental health and wellbeing and their reported use of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp. The researchers found a two-way effect, where at particular ages, social media use was linked to a drop in life satisfaction a year on, while low life satisfaction was linked to greater social media use the year after. The findings are averages and cannot be used to predict how any one particular individual may respond to social media. The study, published in Nature Communications, does not prove that social media harms wellbeing, but the researchers suspect there may be “windows of vulnerability”, which open at different times for boys and girls. Given the broad and complex changes that occur in adolescence, biologically and socially, the mechanisms may take some time to nail down. Prof Yvonne Kelly, an epidemiologist at UCL who was not involved in the study, said the findings confirmed what she and others had shown, including that higher rates of depression among girls were linked to more time on social media, online bullying and poor sleep. “One of the big challenges with using information about the amount of time spent on social media is that it isn’t possible to know what is going on for young people, and what they are encountering whilst online,” Kelly said. “To advance the science, and importantly to make changes to improve young people’s wellbeing, we need more detailed, nuanced data about people’s online experiences. It is this kind of information, including that held by social media companies, that will help us better understand any causal processes, for better or worse, that are at play.” Prof Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, a co-author of the study and a psychologist at the University of Cambridge, said it is helpful to set rules on when children use social media so that it does not interfere with their sleep. It is also important to educate them early on about the range of issues they might encounter, she added, such as not being invited to parties, social pressure, and images that might upset them. Dr Holly Scott, a psychologist at the University of Glasgow, said the study provided “robust new evidence” that there were different sensitive periods for boys and girls. “Girls seem to be more sensitive to the impact of social media slightly earlier than boys, which may be due to maturational processes like puberty starting earlier,” she said. “Important next steps are to understand from the adolescent perspective what benefits and challenges social media offers, so that we can build on this evidence that measures social media in hours per day, to develop a well-rounded view of the opportunities and barriers that today’s 24/7 online social world can create for our young people,” Scott added.",News/Society,"Social media may affect girls’ mental health earlier than boys’, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/28/social-media-may-affect-girls-mental-health-earlier-than-boys-study-finds
3/29/2022,"In the 1990s, as a teacher of A-level early modern English and European history, I leaned heavily on Sir John Elliott’s excellent book Imperial Spain to provide me with a guide and source material. I even persuaded our school librarian to buy three copies so that my students could dip in and extend their own awareness – almost unheard of as the budget was so tight. When one particular class had left, I checked the books in the library and found that a student had written on the title page of one copy (in pencil): “This is the best book ever on Spanish history.” Even allowing for exaggeration, this tribute, I feel sure, would have delighted any scholar.",Arts/Books,Letter: Sir John Elliott obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/28/letter-sir-john-elliott-obituary
3/29/2022,"George Russell has warned that he and his teammate, Lewis Hamilton, have no chance of fighting for the Formula One title unless Mercedes drastically improves, speculating it could take up to eight races for them to be competitive at the front of the grid. Russell and Hamilton finished fifth and 10th respectively at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on Sunday, which was won by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc finishing second. Mercedes were almost one second a lap off the pace of the leaders during parts of the race, with Hamilton, the seven-time champion, reduced to scrapping for a point with Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll. Russell, in his debut season with Mercedes, believes their major problem – the downforce stalling on a straight known as porpoising – is responsible for 99% of the lack of pace and that the car’s potential cannot be unlocked until that is solved. “We are definitely not out of it but if we don’t manage to find some improvements there is no way we will be fighting for this championship,” said the 24-year-old. “We are not giving up. Even if we continue like this for the next five, six, seven or eight races we are still going to be in touching distance and there is no reason we can’t overturn it. We need to see how things look by the time we get halfway through the season. Everything can change. “I don’t see any reason why we will make any strides forward. We are the third-fastest team at the moment and closer to the fourth than we are to second, so it’s going to be more of the same in the coming races.” Russell trails Leclerc, the championship leader, by 23 points after two races of the season, with Hamilton 29 behind and Mercedes are 40 points adrift of Ferrari in the team standings. This is largely uncharted territory for the outfit, who have won the past eight constructors’ championships and become used to enjoying a level of dominance at the front of the grid. The team principal, Toto Wolff, said their lack of performance is a sobering experience. “We had the luxury of being in the middle of those fun games for the past eight years and it is extremely painful not to be part of it,” he said. “We’re not going to rest until we are back in the mix. It’s no fun at all, it’s an exercise in humility, and it’s going to make us stronger in the end, even though it’s not funny right now.” Australia hosts the next race, at Melbourne’s Grand Prix Circuit on 10 April.",Sport/Sport,Russell fears it could take months for Mercedes to be competitive again,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/28/russell-fears-it-could-take-months-for-mercedes-to-be-competitive-again
3/29/2022,"Video footage purporting to show the torture of Russian prisoners of war is being investigated by the Ukrainian government. The film, which has not been verified, appears to show Ukrainian soldiers removing three hooded Russians from a van before shooting them in the legs. The Ukrainian military commander Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi accused Russia of staging the videos. “The enemy produces and shares videos with the inhuman treatment of alleged ‘Russian prisoners’ by ‘Ukrainian soldiers’ in order to discredit the Ukrainian defence forces,” Zaluzhnyi said. However, the government in Kyiv said they were taking the allegations of mistreatment “very seriously” and that there would be an immediate investigation. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: “We are a European army, and we do not mock our prisoners. If this turns out to be real, this is absolutely unacceptable behaviour.” Arestovych added: “I would like to remind all our military, civilian and defence forces once again that the abuse of prisoners is a war crime that has no amnesty under military law and has no statute of limitations.” Oleksander Motuzyanyk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military, said they did not know who was involved or where the incidents took place. “Currently, no one can confirm or deny the veracity of this video,” he said. “It’s not known where it’s happening, or who the participants are.” The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the “monstrous images” needed to be legally assessed and for those who took part to be held responsible. The footage emerged as Ukrainian forces claimed significant victories on the battlefield on Monday, with the local mayor of Irpin saying that the town, which is on the north-west outskirts of Kyiv, had been retaken. Oleksandr Markushyn said: “We have good news today – Irpin has been liberated. We understand that there will be more attacks on our town and we will defend it courageously.” In Kharkiv, the mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said the war was turning against the Russians despite his city being shelled for weeks. He said: “People have begun to return to Kharkiv. Foremost, these are men who have taken their families to safe places and now are returning to defend their home town by joining the territorial defence forces. Moreover, sometimes even entire families are returning. Now we have an opportunity to evacuate people, but there are almost no takers.” He said that at the latest count the Russians had destroyed or damaged 1,177 residential buildings, 53 kindergartens, more than 50 schools and 10 hospitals. He said: “No matter what, the whole city works as an integral whole. Volunteers and police deliver humanitarian aid to the place of non-stop shelling. We are all as one making a common cause. Kharkiv lives and works.”",News/World news,Ukraine government investigates video alleged to show torture of Russian PoWs,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/ukraine-government-investigates-video-alleged-torture-russian-prisoners-of-war
3/29/2022,"It was such a big occasion for the Richmond Union Bowling Club, members in their late 60s had come out of retirement. Some clubs recruit star players from overseas to succeed. Richmond – the tiny, unpretentious bowls club that inspired the movie Crackerjack – never has. Instead, its players are made up of rough diamonds and bar stragglers, brought together by acceptance and fun. If they were to win, it would be the first time in the club’s 153 year history to have qualified for the Victorian Bowls Premier League, and the second time in two years to have been promoted. It had been the equivalent of leap-frogging from country footy to the AFL, seeing a trickled return of star players from the old days eager for a share in the glory. So, when the last bowl to determine promotion to the Premier League ricocheted off the green on Sunday afternoon, sailing Richmond to a 79-73 “fairytale” win, commentators expected its members to flood onto the pitch. Instead, the reception at Dandenong Bowling Club was strangely mute – saved for a few back taps and the shaking of hands. Richmond was too moved by the moment to celebrate. They were crying in the stands. It took four decades and a bowls club for Tony “Ricky” Baker to find his place in the world. Until his late 30s, Baker toured regional Victorian bowls clubs, battling with his identity as a queer man in rural communities. When he eventually arrived in Melbourne, the first thing he did was seek out a local club. As fate had it, Baker found the Richmond Union Bowling Club, an easily missed spot tucked on a side street between a town hall and a swimming pool. “As soon as I walked in here, I felt like I was back in the regions where everyone’s looking out for each other,” he says. “But here, for the first time, I had the opportunity to be myself with my sexuality. As soon as I walked in, I was encouraged to be who I want to be, be who I am.” Richmond Union is the only bowling club in Australia to have its own annual Pride Cup, to take place this year on 15 May. The third-oldest club in Australia (or fourth, depending on who you ask), the site has withstood fires, development and gentrification for 153 years. Baker says the members make the club – “always have”. Nowadays, it has 20 gay members, “a few fence-sitters” and its own pride uniform: a rainbow kit splashed with Richmond’s iconic tiger. “It’s hard to find community in this new age, it’s rare,” Baker says. “But it’s a safe space here, even if you’re not a bowler. It’s somewhere you can come in and get support. Day two I got here I was already nicknamed Ricky. “And as soon as you’re comfortable in all aspects of your life … if your head’s in the right place, if you’re happy, you enjoy it more, and you bowl better.” David “Bestie” Best established the first Pride Cup in lawn bowls history in 2018. “I wanted the LGBTI community to have some fun and let their hair down. So the first year we had eight teams, and the second year we had 16,” he says. “It started at 10 and finished at five, it was brilliant. And as soon as the bar’s open, it always kicks on.” Best says Richmond Union has always been different, for some reason or another. Even these days, they’ll still play clubs that are “very anti-female, anti-gay”. “Gay people might bowl in certain clubs but they won’t be relaxed because it’s not safe, they’re not recognised. Here, you still get people you don’t like and might have to bowl with them for 14 weeks, but you accept everyone for who they are,” he says. “I’ve been here six years and this is my home. I live in Coburg, but this is my home.” Out by the green, Noelene “Killer” Gerty surveys the bowlers from the sidelines with a can of coke and a cigarette. She says her “big hands, big feet and small body” make her a natural at the sport. But it’s been a fight since she rolled into the club three decades ago. Back then, women were still in their own division until a landmark court case in 2001. “We had to go to court to get to play on Saturday,” she says. “Women started here in the 1930s but they weren’t allowed in the club, they had their own clubhouse. “It wasn’t until the 70s or later they were allowed in, to do the afternoon teas. The men would send the women letters saying ‘we’ll need 10 women to do the catering’ for their opening days.” When Gerty started in 1990, she says, the club had missed “the whole sex revolution in the 60s and 70s”. “They still had ridiculous things about uniform, so your dress had to be a certain length, which was really dumb,” she says. “Instead of saying just below your knee, they had 15 inches from the ground, and a little measuring stick. A girl I knew was told her dress was too short so she just took it off and said you go fix it, and kept playing in her petticoat.” Still, some clubs offer women reduced subscription fees, giving them no real rights and the expectation that they do the catering. Others remain segregated, with women unable to bowl at weekends. The current Richmond Union president, Bob Hutton, says the club has no all-male league – it’s either mixed, or women’s only. “Richmond is one of the most diverse suburbs in Melbourne, and we want to be inclusive,” he says. “Bowls is the only sport that’s not discriminatory. It doesn’t matter your gender, your body type. We just want somewhere people feel safe. Nothing more complicated than that.” If you cross the green to the back of the club, a marble statue of legendary bowler Walter Nation stands at the original level of the pitch, first laid down in 1868. Before his death by drowning at 41, Nation won the 1888 UBG Single Handed Bowls Championship while he was club secretary. Hutton says his ashes are scattered among the chips in the club’s garden. Times have changed since Nation’s day, but a reverence for the greats and respect for the game still reverberates, on and off the green. Over lockdown, bowler Michael “Stats” Quayle spent 500 hours making trading cards of Richmond players dating back to 1905, and has printed thousands of them to be sold over the bar. It’s the first time ever, as far as Quayle can tell, that anyone has made a full deck of trading cards for a bowls club. Nation features in the deck, of course. “I’ve googled it, found some cards of Australian players but nothing’s been done like this,” Quayle says. “Pretty much 95% of the club are in it, there’s three or four who just didn’t understand what it was, it’s not compulsory but when I started it I wanted 150, and I’ve got 153.” The idea had been brewing quietly for years, but when Quayle got an iPad for his 50th birthday in March, he took it as a sign. “I thought, ‘I can do this now’,” he says. “On that day I went ‘I’m going to do this’, even made a speech on my birthday saying ‘I decided I’m going to do this thing’.” Quayle says his “obsessive” personality helped him, but liaising with more than 100 bowls players over lockdown was hard. “I just thought it would be cool to have my own trading card. Then I did a few of us, thought … ‘I’ll have to do these guys as well’, then just went ‘ah … all right, everybody’s in’,” he says. “A lot of people are really old and don’t have internet, so I had forms floating around the club and got people phoning. Money is always pretty tight, but the club somehow survives. A few years ago, it was under threat of development,but a hard fight earned it a 99-year tenure on the site. “They were going to take us over and put us on the roof,” Hutton says. “We don’t want to be a pub with a bowling green, we want to be a club.” When Richmond high school opened next door in 2018, club member John “Jingles” Inglese saw it as an opportunity. He reached out to the school and quickly got a year seven and eight program up and running, which has now become an integral part of the club’s recruitment strategy. Three students now bowl with the club permanently. Best says the young blood “puts us to shame”. Year 10 student Tay Alcott has played with the club for two years since graduating from the program. “It’s supportive here, everyone treats me like I’m one of them,” he says. “I come down here twice a week and everyone knows my name, it’s nice.” Teacher Jess Hayes says bowls has been a revelation for kids “you can’t get off the sideline for a game of basketball”, and children from disadvantaged backgrounds. “We’ve had kids coming from low socioeconomic backgrounds because it’s free, there’s no cost to their families,” she says. As the afternoon drifts into the early evening, beer glasses are refilled, music starts to play. The bowlers drift from the green to the sidelines, reminiscing about past tournaments, jeering one another. Every so often someone will land a ripper shot and a small murmur will pass through the group. At the club’s bar, in prime position by the loo, a framed poster signed by Mick Molloy reads: “This is where it all began”. The story goes that Molloy and his mates learned to bowl at the Richmond Union, where they would drink beers and discuss what would one day become the cult film Crackerjack. You can picture the scene down to the jesting barman, Walter Nation’s portrait looming over them, stragglers rolling in off the green. A few beers in, Ricky Baker is getting reflective. He looks out to the same green, 153 years of history in it. It’s not just a green, of course. It never was. “This is gold,” he says, light sinking over the high rises. “This is gold to us.”",News/Australia news,Bowling for pride: Melbourne club that inspired cult comedy plays host to LGBTQ comp,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/bowling-for-pride-melbourne-club-that-inspired-cult-comedy-plays-host-to-lgbtq-comp
3/29/2022,"The New South Wales government has approved less than 400 disaster relief grants for flood-ravaged Northern Rivers businesses, despite receiving almost 8,000 requests for help since applications opened almost a month ago. After the state’s north was left reeling by weeks of devastating floods, the government announced grants of up to $50,000 for small businesses to help pay for cleanup costs, repairs, replace damaged stock and to lease temporary premises. But one month on, less than 5% of the grant applications – or just 377 of the 7,965 received by Resilience NSW – have been approved by the state government. Fewer still have been paid out. Funds have been released for 267 applications, worth about $3.9m. The government has rejected more applications than it has approved, with the emergency services minister, Steph Cooke, blaming the delay on flood-hit business owners providing “incomplete and missing” documentation. The state government has rejected 657 bids for relief, worth $12.15m. Almost 2,900 applications worth $46.9m are still being assessed, while Resilience NSW is waiting on more information from applicants in 3,298 applications worth $62.2m. Byron Shire mayor, Michael Lyon, said there was “massive need” for business relief grants across his shire, where towns like Mullumbimby were hit hard, and the broader Northern Rivers region, particularly in Lismore. Lyon said the state government must explain why it is taking so long to assess applications, given the immediacy of the need. “There’s no doubt about the need, we’ve had several CBD areas in the Northern Rivers, I know Mullumbimby was badly affected, and there’s a lot of businesses that actually have businesses from home, in places like Ocean Shores,” he said. “I would suggest that there is definitely a need in our shire and lots of other shires. It would be very interesting to find out why there are so many delays. Approve or reject, yes, but [for them to be] outstanding, that’s not really good enough.” The grants are intended for small businesses and not-for-profits that were directly damaged in the floods and plan to re-establish themselves in the same region. The money can pay for a range of work, including cleaning, safety inspections and debris removal, and can be used to buy materials and equipment needed to immediately resume trading, or replace cars, damaged stock or internal fittings. Cooke said that the government had been processing about 400 applications a day, and would increase the number to 640 over the coming week. “Around three-quarters of applications received so far are incomplete and missing key documentation,” she said. “Service NSW is working with customers who have lost documentation in the floods to progress their applications as quickly as possible.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While payments of up to $15,000 are available on the basis of quotes of estimates, larger grant applications require businesses to provide evidence they have already spent the money. The Ballina Greens MP, Tamara Smith, said those restrictions were “absolutely cruel”. “What I find bizarre is that you now have a whole class of business who can’t apply because they don’t have $35,000 on hand and, of the people who can muster it, there are these delays in paying the money out,” she said. “It’s a lot of bureaucratic bungling that people just cant afford.” Murwillumbah district chamber of commerce president, Rebecca Whan, said the delays in processing the grants were “pretty concerning, to say the least”. Whan said some business owners in flood-hit Murwillumbah had just $14 in their bank accounts. She knew of local business owners taking on work as part of clean-up crews to bring in enough income to keep their businesses alive. The cash grant was the first step in rebuilding, she said, and re-opening for many businesses would “simply not occur in many cases” without it. “There are a lot of emotions and it’s very distressing for a lot of them,” she said. “If you’ve got financial stress on top of everything else, it just breaks the back of people at the moment.” She said the grants were time-critical for many businesses, as delays to cleaning and the removal of debris allowed mould to spread, creating a health risk and raising the prospect of buildings being deemed uninhabitable. The delays meant many towns ran the risk of having empty shopfronts “for months on end”, which will create a ripple effect throughout the CBDs that could last years. “People need a glimmer of hope,” she said.",News/Australia news,"NSW government approves 377 grants for flood-hit business, despite receiving 8,000 applications",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/nsw-government-approves-377-grants-for-flood-hit-business-despite-receiving-8000-applications
3/29/2022,"Even casual observers of our nation’s politics will recall the moment the then treasurer Scott Morrison walked into question time with a lump of coal, waving it in the direction of the opposition and yelling, “this is coal, don’t be afraid”. It was a stunt that launched a thousand memes and op eds. It was a cheap trick as well as being fundamentally inaccurate. Burning coal and gas is the main driver of climate change, if we are to believe trusted institutions such as the CSIRO, not to mention every credible climate scientist in the country and around the world. That being said, and in the light of my research on public attitudes to climate change and energy in Australia, I recognise there is a tiny sliver of – truth? perhaps insight is a better word – in what our now prime minister had to say about coal. In the focus groups I do in resource seats in the New South Wales Hunter region and northern Queensland and Western Australia, where coal and gas have provided communities with jobs for decades, there is a visceral reaction to any description of those industries as “dirty” or “destructive”. Not because they don’t recognise that pollution comes from burning fossil fuels or that climate change isn’t real or that the future of energy is renewables. But because when you use words aimed at provoking fear and disgust to describe coal it seems like you are, by association, bagging the people and communities that make their living from these industries. As a man in the Hunter remarked to me in a focus group last year: “I don’t like the word dirty. I get that coal is polluting, but use that word, it sounds like there is something wrong with the people who are working in the mines. And they are just trying to pay the bills.” The importance to the nation of the work done in these communities is increasingly being acknowledged by the climate movement, which continues to argue for support for workers during the inevitable transition away from fossil fuels. Over the last two decades, as the climate wars have toppled prime minister after prime minister, the word “carbon” has become as politically charged as “coal”. Carbon emissions, carbon footprint, carbon credits, carbon tax. Words the public hear all the time and don’t really understand. A new documentary, Carbon: The Unauthorised Biography, on which I worked as script adviser, attempts to explain what carbon is and what it can do. It tries in its own way to “un-demonise” carbon. To show how carbon is everywhere, talked about but so misunderstood. And, of course, abused and misused, ultimately to our own detriment and the detriment of future generations. The film aims to be more than just the usual science documentary you might watch on the National Geographic channel, or on a rainy day at a high school. Its first unique twist is to personify carbon, to make it the narrator of its own story, in the evocative tones of acclaimed actor Sarah Snook no less. And it opens in the most beguiling way, with scenes to make us realise how essential, how omnipresent, how wonderful and how powerful carbon is. It makes us fall in love with carbon through images and poetic language that guide us through photosynthesis, minerals, plastics, the air we breathe, the food we eat and cook, our bodies themselves (one-fifth of our bodies are made up of carbon). Snook’s voice of Carbon is not the only storyteller. World-renowned researchers such as Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bob Hazen and Katharine Hayhoe speak in rapturous terms about the power and the glory of carbon as both a creator and destructor. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning By the time we are in the thrall of carbon’s boundless capacities, we slide into a sequence that shows its terrible power as highlighted by the industrial revolution, world wars and of course climate change. In this way it is a climate change documentary in science documentary clothing, but all the more effective because of that. The writer and co-director of the film, Australia’s Daniella Ortega, wanted to tell the story of carbon as a way to cut through the noise and partisan politics around climate. “I have two young children,” she says. “In a world with a climate already changed and a future filled with the destructive consequences of this, I want to offer them a narrative that can best prepare them for the journey ahead, and that I believe is the life story of carbon.” The message of this visually arresting documentary is clear. If treated with respect, carbon is life-giving, beautiful, wondrous. When abused, it is indeed something to be afraid of.

3/29/2022,"South-eastAustralia could face gas shortages as soon as the 2023 winter because of delays for a planned NSW import terminal and falling Bass Strait output, according to the annual review of the sector by the Australian Energy Market Operator. Aemo’s gas statement of opportunities report, which maps the supply and demand for the fuel over the next two decades, said shortages could be avoided by using less gas in power generation on cold days but also accelerating the switch to electricity. Regions affected by the potential shortfall during one-in-20-year extreme weather include Victoria, the state most dependent on gas for heating homes; Tasmania; the ACT and parts of southern NSW. “A shortfall risk in the south-eastern states in winter 2023 is forecast under extreme conditions, given ongoing production decline from Bass Strait and pipeline capacity limits from northern Australia,” said Merryn York, Aemo’s executive general manager system design. A year ago, Aemo had forecast the Port Kembla Energy Terminal (Pket) intended for Wollongong, would be pumping 500 terrajoules of gas a day by 2023 into domestic supply. That plant, part of Andrew Forrest’s Australian Industrial Energy group, now probably won’t be ready until the following year. Household use of gas, in particular, is highly seasonal, with winter demand triple that of warmer months. Electricity demand, meanwhile, tends to peak during summer. Gas use in the power sector has been declining as renewable sources grow. During still, cloudy days in winter, coal-fired power plants could be expected to fill much of the generation load, however, the accelerated closure of coal capacity may mean more gas is needed during winter as well. AGL, Australia’s biggest electricity producer, is expected to close the first of the four units at its Liddell 1,680-megawatt coal plant in the Hunter on Friday, underscoring that transition. The other three units are scheduled to close in April 2023. The majority of Australia’s gas is exported. There is no shortage, just limited pipeline or terminal capacity. In Bass Strait, though, which has long been the main source of the fossil fuel in southern Australia, output is forecast to keep shrinking. Aemo said existing and committed available production in the south will drop from 487 petajoules in 2022 to 360 petajoules by 2026. Aemo uses five scenarios to project demand use. Under the so-called “step change” track – considered by stakeholders to be the most likely – a gas shortfall would be “narrowly avoided” in 2023. That outcome assumes gas demand will drop as consumers shift quickly to electricity, particularly for heating, and improve energy efficiency. “While these [changes] are likely over time, the pace so far has been relatively slow, and urgent action would be needed to put south-eastern regions on the Step Change path by next winter,” Aemo said. If not, by the winter of 2023, “there are risks of small, infrequent gas shortfalls under extreme one-in-20 year demand conditions”. Meeting committed infrastructure targets will also be key. The Western Outer Ring Main, or Worm, in Victoria, is one such project Aemo assumes will be ready in time for next year’s winter.To ensure the risks of forced gas shortages can be minimised, Aemo is planning to mimic demand management tools used to avoid power blackouts during summer. These include the Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (Rert) that rewards big electricity users to cut power use. Aemo also issued a separate Victorian gas planning report to highlight that state’s challenges. It noted the Andrews Labor government is preparing a gas substitution roadmap to identify how the gas industry can contribute to the state’s net zero target by 2050. Under the step-change scenario, Aemo forecasts a drop of 16.8% in annual gas consumption in Victoria by 2026, with peak day demands forecast to reduce by about 18%. The ACT, too, has a climate change strategy to reach net zero emissions by 2045, including the removal of mandatory gas connections for new residential suburbs. Aemo predicted that by 2035, seasonal supply gaps will be again be a risk. By then, the south-eastern region would be “completely reliant on imported gas transported from northern supplies and Pket, and storage cannot fill the gap” without more investment, it said.",News/Australia news,"South-east Australia risks temporary gas shortages by 2023 winter, energy review warns",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/south-east-australia-risks-temporary-gas-shortages-by-2023-winter-energy-review-warns

More recently, it has been credited with something equally revolutionary: levelling the playing field for nudity. After years of women’s naked bodies being objectified on our screens, men are finally also baring all. From the Harry Goldenblatt reveal on And Just Like That to the myriad members of Euphoria, the era of dicks has arrived. And no show is doing more for this moment than Minx. Staunch second-wave feminist Joyce Prigger (Ophelia Lovibond) takes her magazine prototype The Matriarchy Awakens to the 1971 Southern California Magazine Pitch festival, where her dreams are patronisingly crushed. That is, until she meets porn publisher Doug Renetti (Jake Johnson), who wants to make the magazine happen. But there’s a catch: The Matriarchy Awakens would be rebranded to become the first women’s erotic magazine, the titular Minx. Doug’s rationale? Joyce wants equality and he’s offering it: “Why is it fair and equal that a guy has 12 places to go to see a pair of titties, but a woman has nowhere to go to see a dong?” It’s a succinct argument and it’s fun to watch Joyce, a fish out of water as an uptight feminist in the porn industry, wrestle with her desire to make her magazine and the realities of the market. Minx is loosely based on the creation of Playgirl, and Doug’s Bottom Dollar Publishing has a lively staff: Bambi (Jessica Lowe), a blonde bimbo with an open heart and inquiring mind; Richie (Oscar Montoya), a gay photographer; and Tina (Idara Victor), a sharpshooting Black woman and Doug’s righthand woman. And Doug himself, who is quick to remind Joyce he is the money behind the venture – so Minx better not fail. So what about the part about the male parts? As Bambi puts it: “There’s shorties, fatties, long ones and flatties…”, and from the first episode, Minx has them all. From casting calls to centrefold photoshoots, the dicks are everywhere and this may shock audiences (at least initially). This is a comedy, after all. But Minx is also a metacommentary, a knowing wink to the politics of objectification and small-screen nudity. Joyce is championing a magazine that will “establish the female gaze … at the exciting intersection between feminism and eroticism”. By episode five, a centrefold based on Michelangelo’s David is literally – and figuratively – taken “off the pedestal”, showing Minx is about normalising sex and gender politics, equality and nudity. The show’s beige seventies hues infer a triumphant nostalgia. Remember magazines? Remember porn before the internet? Or a time when you couldn’t get the pill? Remember when girlbosses in woollen pant suits weren’t taken seriously? But don’t let the pussybow blouses fool you, for Minx also has an eye on how far we have to go. Joyce’s quips about “abolishing gender distinctions [being] squarely in the zeitgeist” could still be uttered today. Peripheral character councilwoman Bridget Westbury (Amy Landecker) reminds us that many women in power uphold paternalistic and patriarchal traditions in office. And the female gaze is still predominantly a white one. Created by Ellen Rappaport, with Bridesmaids director Paul Feig serving as executive producer, Minx is very funny, if light. Lovibond’s passionate and uptight Joyce plays well off her co-stars. Taylor Zakhar Perez’s turn as Shane Brody, Minx’s first cover star and super-sweet himbo, is amusing. But even pantless firefighter Shane is upstaged by Jake Johnson as Doug at every turn: he is endlessly charismatic, playing Doug with the right amount of smarm and charm that is beyond endearing. In the first five episodes available for review, Joyce is still learning to loosen up. With that comes limitations. Minx’s collation, publication and distribution is delayed by a series of philosophical quandaries, local political interference and a disagreement with the mafia. But what happens when the magazine is released to the world? The first half of the season, while fun, feels a little insular. It could be that Minx will become a great show that, once taken off its dick-baring pedestal, is more than just a fairly run-of-the-mill comedy – but unlike the many images of male genitalia in Minx, that’s yet to be seen.

3/29/2022,"Queensland’s transport minister has described the budget eve announcement of a train line from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast as being in “circus sort of territory”, saying the promised money appeared “plucked out of the sky”. But commuter advocates have welcomed the promised Sunshine Coast extension as having the potential to “revolutionise” public transport from Brisbane to the beaches. A train line between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, and faster rail to the Gold Coast, will be the big ticket items in an election eve budget splash on Queensland by the federal government. The Morrison government has promised $3.9bn for infrastructure projects in the state as it prepares to host the 2032 Olympics, including $1.6bn for a new train line to Maroochydore, on the Sunshine Coast. Another $1.12bn has been promised for a faster train service to the Gold Coast. At a press conference on Monday, the treasurer, Cameron Dick, welcomed the money promised for Queensland infrastructure – its $3.9b compared to the $3.3b allocated for infrastructure in both New South Wales and Victoria and the $2.1b to Western Australia. Dick said the state had “done the business case” and invested in the Gold Coast faster rail, and was pleased it had been matched by the federal government. But the treasurer expressed “a bit of surprise” at the dollar figure attached to the Sunshine Coast rail extension. Queensland would be expected to match Canberra’s $1.6b, but Dick said his government had been advised the project would cost more. “They think they can deliver the project for $3.2b – that’s not the advice we received,” the treasurer said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He then went on to slam the Morrison government’s priorities, calling on it to co-fund the state’s $771m disaster assistance package rather than focus on “LNP seats on the Sunshine Coast”. Federal urban infrastructure minister, Paul Fletcher, said in a statement that track upgrades between Kuraby to Beenleigh would allow for the doubling of express and all stop services to the Gold Coast. Coupled with the track extension from Beerwah to Maroochydore, the two projects would “enhance connectivity” between the capital and major regional centres to the north and south, forming part of a 200km north-south rail corridor, “with Brisbane at the centre”. “With the 2032 Olympic Games just a decade away, it is critical that we plan and invest in the required infrastructure now so that Queensland is not only well equipped to host a successful Games, but can support sustainable growth over the coming decades,” Fletcher said. The budget also included $396m for the “city deal” designed to deliver key infrastructure to south-east Queensland ahead of the Games that was signed last week by the prime minister, premier and the region’s mayors. But the bipartisanship loudly proclaimed at that signing was notably absent from the Queensland government’s response to this week’s budget announcements. Transport minister, Mark Bailey, said Queenslanders had a right to be cynical of the Sunshine Coast announcement. “We have no idea on what basis this $1.6bn figure has come from,” Bailey said. “There is a preliminary valuation under way right now, the business case is due next year.” “This figure seems to be plucked out of the sky.” Bailey said the two governments had not had “any discussions” about the plans, a fact he said consigned them to “circus sort of territory”. But commuter advocate Jeffrey Addison called on the state government to “get on board” for a project that he said would “revolutionise transport to and from the Sunshine Coast”. Addison previously commuted by train four hours a day from Brisbane to his Sunshine Coast hinterland home for 18 years. “A lot of complaints are made about the north coast line being through the hinterland and too far from the coast – well this will give people access to the beaches,” he said. “It goes into the heart of Maroochydore.”",News/Australia news,‘Plucked from the sky’: Queensland government questions funding for Sunshine Coast rail project,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/plucked-from-the-sky-queensland-government-questions-funding-for-sunshine-coast-rail-project
3/29/2022,"New South Wales Labor committed to increasing diversity within the party just months before bypassing a local rank-and-file vote to install a white candidate in the federal seat of Parramatta, at the expense of three people of colour. After installing Kristina Keneally as the party’s candidate in the south-west Sydney electorate of Fowler last year, a cross-factional group pushed for greater diversity among candidates. At the NSW state conference in October, the group put forward a motion to change the party’s platform, recognising “ongoing underrepresentation of culturally and linguistically diverse people” in senior leadership positions “across business, politics, government and higher education”. The proposal committed Labor to “improving the representation of culturally and linguistically diverse people across all organisations”, including the party. The motion was passed unanimously, along with a commitment to compile data on diversity in key positions in the party and to appoint organisers to better engage with non-white communities before the federal election. But after the decision to bypass a local preselection to install former Kevin Rudd adviser and economist Andrew Charlton as the party’s candidate in the marginal seat of Parramatta, some members say they’re frustrated Labor has missed another opportunity to promote diverse candidates. “It feels like one step forward, two steps back,” said Osmond Chiu, a research fellow at the thinktank Per Capita and a member of NSW Labor’s policy forum. “The real frustration I have is that opportunities to increase diversity in parliament are so rare. “My huge frustration is that even if for whatever reason the party didn’t support the candidates who were going to nominate in Parramatta, we couldn’t find a single candidate in that seat that seemed to represent the area.” While the push for more diversity preceded Keneally’s preselection in Fowler, he said that decision had “brought it to the forefront.” “From my conversations, after Fowler there was a recognition this was a problem,” he said. “I think this issue about cultural and linguistic diversity in the party was seen as a lower priority and Fowler elevated it so there was a sense something had to happen, something had to be done.” Guardian Australia previously reported that Labor intervened at the request of party leader, Anthony Albanese, to halt a local preselection in Parramatta. That was despite three candidates from diverse backgrounds having expressed interest in running. It’s prompted an angry backlash from local party members, and led to criticism from the retiring MP Julie Owen. Instead, Labor’s national executive confirmed Charlton will be the party’s candidate in the seat on Monday night after he was the only nominee. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Guardian Australia understands all three candidates who had flagged an intention to run in the seat decided not to nominate once the preselection was referred to national executive, because his candidacy was understood to be a fait accompli. A Rhodes scholar and former Rudd adviser, Charlton lives in a $16m home in the well-heeled suburb of Bellevue Hill in Sydney’s east, about 30km away from Parramatta. His installation in the seat has reinvigorated debate about Labor’s commitment to increasing diversity in parliament. The earlier decision to install Keneally as its candidate in Fowler last year came at the expense of Vietnamese Australian lawyer Tu Le, who had been backed by the outgoing Labor MP Chris Hayes. Charishma Kaliyanda, a Labor councillor in Liverpool which is covered by the Fowler electorate, said she was disappointed the party had not learned its lesson. “It’s disappointing that after all of the words spoken and commitments made in the wake of Fowler we’ve yet again gone back to status quo or, in inverted commas, the ‘safe decision’ in held and safe seats,” she said. “After Fowler there was this outpouring of passion where so many people contacted me who I had no idea were interested in politics to say, you know, we actually think that it is important that we have more diversity in our political system. “It wasn’t about Kristina Keneally, [but] more about when these people are looking at the representatives making decisions on their behalf, they see people who seem very disconnected from their own lives, dreams and aspirations. “People were very vocal about that, but it seems like in Parramatta there’s kind of a tinge of cynicism about it. It’s like, we can speak up about it, and the party will say all the right things, but they’re just going to do the same things again.” According to the 2016 census, less than 40% of the Parramatta electorate was born in Australia. Nearly 15% of residents were born in India and 8% in China, with Lebanon, South Korea and Sri Lanka also highly represented. Chiu, who previously released research showing Australia’s parliaments lagged far behind comparative countries such as New Zealand and the UK in electing candidates from diverse backgrounds, said both major parties had failed to prioritise the issue. “The median length of an MP’s career is over a decade, so unless we start prioritising diversity right now we’re going to have a monocultural parliament decades into the future,” he said.",News/Australia news,Disillusionment grows within Labor about the party’s commitment to cultural diversity,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/disillusionment-grows-within-labor-about-the-partys-commitment-to-cultural-diversity
3/29/2022,"New data has identified the affluent Gold Coast suburb of Paradise Point as having the highest value of property at risk of coastal erosion in Australia. An estimated $1.4bn worth of property within 6.4km of the coastline in Paradise Point is at “very high risk” of coastal erosion or storm-surge-related damage within the next 30 to 60 years, according to analysis by CoreLogic. Data shows about 20% of the suburb’s housing stock is at high risk, equivalent to 40% of the suburb’s total residential value. That’s three times more value of property at risk than any other area in Australia – with more than 400 homes in Paradise Point classified as “high” or “very high risk”. But the dire forecast for the suburb’s coastline hasn’t stopped buyers from flocking to the Gold Coast’s booming property market, says local real estate agent Mark MacCabe. He says Paradise Point’s property market has surged over the past five years, with the average property selling for $1.1m and the top of the market seeing sales in excess of $3m. “I’ve been a resident for 21 years in what’s considered a low-lying area of Paradise Point and we’ve never had a flood claim,” MacCabe said. “I walk along the waterfront every day and I’m auctioning around Paradise Point every weekend, and I’m not seeing any signs of erosion. “We’re getting no pushback at all, no questions or queries from a professional standpoint.” CoreLogic said its data showed $25bn worth of property in Australia was exposed to a “very high risk” of coastal erosion. Most of that property was located on Queensland’s Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast. Queensland has 311,148 homes located within 1km of the coastline at risk, with an estimated combined value of $218.4bn. But Dr Pierre Wiart, CoreLogic’s head of consulting and risk management, said Paradise Point stood out for two main reasons. “The first is all the residential properties have access to the lagoon and so they are at present located at sea level,” he said. “Secondly, it has the highest concentration of building value in Australia, placing some of the country’s most expensive properties at risk.” Wiart said that while there was a sand bar protecting Paradise Point, homes were vulnerable to flooding during violent storms or tropical cyclones when water from the lagoon hit its peak. “Urban density on the coastal strip of the Gold Coast has been increasing,” he said. “Some areas will be more at risk than others, and it would be wise for local councils and the respective communities to reassess their risk locally.” Wiart said coastal damage would have far-reaching implications on Australia’s property market and financial sector, including on property valuations, home loan viability and insurance premiums. “In the next three decades, coastal risk will crystallise, with the tangible effects of climate change already being felt in most parts of Australia,” Wiart said. “If, during a storm, these properties are impacted then it might change their values, as we have seen during the 2011 Brisbane floods along the riverside-located suburbs. “The … day we realise the area has become vulnerable could be the moment we see a change in the dynamic.”",News/Australia news,Gold Coast suburb has $1.4bn in property at ‘very high risk’ from coastal erosion,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/gold-coast-suburb-has-14bn-in-property-at-very-high-risk-from-coastal-erosion
3/29/2022,"To leave Tehran’s Evin prison is never as simple as to walk out of its gates. The British-Australian academic Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert survived 804 days as a defiant hostage to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), accused variously of being a Mossad agent, an MI6 agent or a spy for Australia, and held in the Guard Corps’ notorious 2A wing of Evin. Two years since Moore-Gilbert won her freedom, reminders of the cruel capriciousness of Iran’s hostage diplomacy are all around. This month, two British nationals, including Iran’s highest-profile political prisoner, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, were freed after the UK paid Iran a decades-old £400m debt. But two more Britons remain held by the country. Days later, an Iranian-Australian man, Shokrollah Jebeli, died in Evin. Moore-Gilbert knows how lucky she is. “I can’t just switch off and move on with my life and forget my friends there and forget the horrible stories I heard and the things I’ve seen,” she tells Guardian Australia. “I have to use my voice to speak out.” Moore-Gilbert says she is “absolutely stoked” that Britons Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori are free, but furious that some in the British establishment celebrated “like it’s some victory for British diplomacy”. She calls it “shameful” that the debt repayment did not secure the release of all four Britons. “Nazanin served both sentences in full … six years. It’s not a victory …. if British diplomacy really was effective, they would have got her out before her sentence ended.” And Moore-Gilbert worries about what comes next. She argues paying cash to the Revolutionary Guards will “entrench the practice” of hostage diplomacy: arbitrarily arresting foreign citizens on spurious charges in order to leverage a diplomatic advantage, or simply a high price, in exchange for their release. “This incentivises hostage-taking. It’s the same faction within the IGRC every time, they brag about it, they say ‘look at all the money we’ve got just because we arrested a couple of spies’.” The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was formed in the aftermath of Iran’s 1979 revolution, charged with upholding the ideals of the Islamic republic and defending it from foreign and domestic threats. It was the Guards who arrested, tried and held Moore-Gilbert for the majority of her time in prison. Moore-Gilbert says they are a law unto themselves, “a state within a state”: ruthless, brutal, but also riven by factionalism and ideological inconsistencies, and in thrall to conspiracy theories and paranoia. The Guards have been proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the US and other countries. More money in their hands, Moore-Gilbert argues, makes the world less safe. “The Revolutionary Guards believe this is their money. The Iranian people won’t see a penny of it. The IRGC will use it to buy weapons, they will use it to kill people on the streets next time a protest movement erupts in Iran. They will funnel weapons and send more mercenaries to Syria, to Palestine, to Yemen, to Iraq, wherever else they are interfering.” Moore-Gilbert had travelled to Iran to attend an academic conference in the city of Qom. But she was a spy, the Guards insisted. Isolated from any contact with the outside world, Moore-Gilbert was told again and again that no one would come for her: her country had abandoned her, her family would forget. Over more than two years, through hundreds of hours of interrogations, she rejected the ever-shifting allegations; she made no confessions; she refused repeated overtures to spy on the Guards’ behalf. No evidence was ever presented that Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer in Islamic Studies at Melbourne University, was a spy for any country. The Australian government dismissed the charges as baseless. She was nonetheless tried by justice Abolqasem Salavati – known as “the hanging judge” for the number of capital sentences he has imposed – inevitably convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Moore-Gilbert’s freedom was ultimately secured by a complicated prisoner swap involving four countries. Three Iranian terrorists, convicted of an attempted bombing on the Israeli embassy in Bangkok, were freed from a Thai jail and welcomed back to Iran with garlands of flowers in a macabre, mocking felicitation. Moore-Gilbert draws a distinction between a prisoner swap and acquiescence to demands for money – “essentially blackmail”. “I know it’s a bit rich of me to say this when I was in the same situation, and it is a moral quandary because innocent people are suffering and you want to alleviate that suffering, but there has to be a red line somewhere. And I think money exchanging hands is that red line. Because you don’t know what they’re going to use that money to do. “I’m very keenly aware that three convicted terrorists were exchanged for me. While assurances were given to the Australian government that these guys would never leave Iranian territory … if one of those three conducted an attack or killed someone, obviously I would feel somehow personally responsible or implicated in that because it’s because of me that they’re not behind bars. That’s hugely worrying to me. “And I do have some moral qualms about that. But I also think if you look at the other prisoner swaps that have occurred, it’s rare that it’s been terrorists, it’s often been Iranians convicted in the West of breaking sanctions.” Moore-Gilbert argues the rest of the world needs to act collectively to halt the practice, to make the price Iran and other states pay for engaging in hostage diplomacy too high. “Every western country who has citizens taken hostage in Iran just kind of reinvents the wheel, they don’t seem to learn from each other’s mistakes or collaborate at all.” The capriciousness of the Iranian regime emerges throughout Moore-Gilbert’s new memoir, The Uncaged Sky, in the erratic attitudes and contradictory demands of her jailers. Interrogators switch, day to day, hour to hour, from oleaginous to threatening, from flirtatious to curtly dismissive. At one point, Moore-Gilbert’s captors want her to entice her then-husband – Israeli dual national Ruslan Hodorov – to Iranian territory. When that is refused, they demand she submit to being filmed for short propaganda films, denouncing the West. She was given vanishingly little information about her situation or the world outside. Cellmates turned out to be spies and the one person within the regime in which she placed some faith – a Mr Hosseini – was summarily removed after she attempted to smuggle out a letter pleading for help. That, she writes, marked a moment of crisis. “Whatever thin tendril of hope I still clutched at slipped from my grasp and I entered a place of blind, unrelenting pain ... I don’t know how it happened, but I found myself beating my own skull against the wall of my cell. Dozens of times. “There was no hope.” A year of Moore-Gilbert’s sentence was spent in solitary confinement, “in some sense worse than physical torture”. “It eats you away from the inside and you go crazy inside your own head. You become your own worst enemy. “For a couple of days, you can cope. But if you’re there formonths and months on end, it is torture. For me, the beginning was really rough because I had no idea where I was or who had captured me or why I was there. I didn’t understand the rules of the place. I didn’t have any language at all. It was a nightmare.” The memoir’s other recurrent theme is Moore-Gilbert’s repeated pleas for her case to be made public. She had been in prison a year before itwas reported, and then only because two other Australians were arrested (then relatively swiftly released). Moore-Gilbert pleaded with her family to go to the media, to campaign publicly, to bring pressure to bear on the Australian government to negotiate, and on the Iranians to respond. Another letter – successfully smuggled out – urged Scott Morrison, “please, I beg of you, to do whatever it takes to get me out”. But the government insisted “quiet diplomacy” was the most effective strategy and would see her home soonest. Moore-Gilbert disagrees. “Public attention and pressure really does help ... I think it played a really important role in my release. “And I saw my prison conditions improve as a result. When it became public in the media, I saw that more attention was paid to my medical conditions. She says she is “heartbroken” by the death this month of Jebeli, an 83-year-old Iranian-Australian held in Evin over a financial dispute, made doubly tragic because it was avoidable. “He died of neglect,” Moore-Gilbert says. “Had enough pressure been applied, had enough noise been made, to get him treatment, he could be alive still. Moore-Gilbert says one of the hardest parts of her incarceration was a sense nothing was happening outside Evin’s walls. “When you have no information, and you’re told ‘no-one is talking about you’, there’s a feeling of abandonment,” she says. Briefly granted her phone during an interrogation, she read articles on the ABC and in the Guardian on her incarceration. “It felt strangely like a validation, as though I now had permission to accept within myself that I was suffering.” The two years trapped in Iran’s prison system “turned the fundamentals of my life upside down”, Moore-Gilbert writes in The Uncaged Sky. Most dramatically, her marriage was ended. Having perceived her husband’s growing distance while in prison – “some sort of game was [being] played behind the scenes about which I knew very little” – Moore-Gilbert was confronted on her release with the news he had started an affair with her doctoral supervisor and university colleague Kylie Baxter. Moore-Gilbert later marked her divorce on Twitter with a champagne bottle emoji, and now speaks about him with resigned indifference, despite, she says, “constant, awkward questions”. But she emphasises it was everything that changed – “my career, my relationships with loved ones, nothing was left unaffected”. “In times of crisis we discover who is prepared to fight in our corner, and who is missing in action, and often the results are surprising.” She recognises that she, too, is changed by the experience. “I’m still the same person I always was at my core [but] I’m definitely more assertive, more confident … I stand up for myself more. “And I guess I’m a bit more solitary as well. I’m used to being alone.” Friends remain in Evin. Two former cellmates, environmental activists Niloufar Bayani and Sepideh Kashani, remain in jail in Iran. It is it to them Moore-Gilbert has dedicated her memoir. And still, her own freedom is not absolute. Moore-Gilbert has had her Twitter and email accounts repeatedly hacked, and she is aware there are Iranian nationals living in her city sympathetic to the Revolutionary Guards’ worldview. She is acutely conscious now, of video surveillance, no matter how benign: “I am always subconsciously aware of where any CCTV cameras are, I just clock them without even realising. “These kinds of behaviours are just ingrained in me from prison, I don’t know if I’ll have them forever, or if they’ll fade with time.” Towards the end of her incarceration, Moore-Gilbert was suddenly dragged from Evin prison and sent to Qarchak – routinely described as the worst women’s prison in the world – on the desert outskirts of Tehran. It was intended as a punishment for some perceived slight against a jailor, and a power play against Australia as the negotiations for her liberty reached a critical point. But it was a moment of almost-joyous solidarity for Moore-Gilbert. Removed from the isolation of Wing 2A for the cacophonous crowd of a general prison wing, she found sorority and friendship. At one stage, she tells a fellow prisoner: “I am Iranian, I am one of you now.” She tells the Guardian, “I can never fathom how such a warm-hearted, generous people can have a regime in charge which is the exact opposite: so cruel and brutal and inhumane. “I was helped by a lot of Iranian people. A lot of them risked themselves to help me when, you know, they owed me nothing. I can’t ever forget that. I can’t forget my friends back there.” Because to leave Evin prison is never as simple as to walk out of its gates.",News/World news,‘A nightmare’: Kylie Moore-Gilbert’s 804 days as a victim of Iran’s hostage diplomacy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/a-nightmare-kylie-moore-gilberts-804-days-as-a-victim-of-irans-hostage-diplomacy
3/29/2022,"Being out in the elements requires protection from them, and as any hiker knows, an outdoor adventure will often involve getting sweaty, dusty and/or wet. While this is part of the fun, when dirt, damp and sweat are left to linger it can shorten the life of outdoor gear; turning a cheap hobby into a very expensive one. “Consistent laundering of gear really helps prolong the life of a product,” says Corey Simpson of Patagonia, because technical fabrics “all perform better when they’re not clogged or covered with dirt and oils”. If you find yourself needing to wash your gear mid camping trip, Simpson says to “find a creek, stream or river to rinse the garments”. While rinsing is fine, using soap in a stream is not. If your camp site does not have dedicated laundry facilities, clothes should be hand washed in a bucket or tub using a biodegradable soap, and the resulting grey-water should be tipped out well away from running water. Finally, hang the clothes to dry in the sun or breeze. Keeping gear dry is one of the most important parts of maintaining it, but this can be tricky if you find yourself caught in the rain, halfway up a mountain on a multi-day hike. The first thing to do is shake off any excess water, then find somewhere dry to hang it. General manager of product at Kathmandu, Robert Fry, suggests inside “your tent’s vestibule” as a good drying spot, “so there’s no chance it’ll drip and wet your dry gear, like your sleeping bag”. If your down jacket has been soaked through, Simpson suggests you “shake the jacket to get the moisture off … and get the down to loft up again”. You can also use your body heat to help dry the jacket. Wear the jacket over any wicking layers you have, then rub your hands over the jacket to get friction and heat entering the garment from the outside. Finally, put your shell on over the jacket and keep moving, so your body heat enters the garment from the inside too. This also works for drying your socks. If your shoes and socks are soaked, Simpson suggests wringing out any excess moisture from your socks and hanging them up to dry. But, if they’re still damp when you next set out, “put them in the inside pocket of a jacket to get your body heat to dry them out”. For the shoes themselves, shake all the excess water out, remove the footbeds and place them near a fire, under a watchful eye. Loading grimy, wet gear into your car for the drive home can feel as if you’re creating even more mess to deal with, which is not a vibe when you’re tired after a big adventure. Simpson suggests keeping large plastic bins in the boot of your car so “you can put dirty, wet and stinky gear in them without getting your car filthy”. When you get home from a hike, start by shaking or rinsing off any dirt and debris from your kit, and then wash each item according to the care instructions. Fry says waterproof products and breathable fabrics should be washed “using a cleaning agent made specifically for [them] on a cold, gentle cycle”. Once everything is clean, make sure your gear is completely dry before you store it. Fry says this should help avoid a buildup of mould, which is important. “Besides being a pain to clean, mould imparts a bad smell, shortens the lifespan of your gear, and in some cases, damages your gear beyond repair”. To dry your gear properly, hang or lie it flat in a well-ventilated area. Fry says you can “quicken the process” by absorbing “some of the excess moisture with towels”. If you find your gear has grown mould on or between trips, use a specific cleaning product like Granger Footwear and Gear Cleaner to spot-clean anything before you wash it. Then, Fry says, “if the care instructions allow, submerge your gear in cold or lukewarm water and remove dirt with a soft cleaning brush or cloth”. If your gear is getting older and starting to show signs of wear, Fry says it’s important to recognise this, as it can impact “your overall experience and safety when spending time ‘out there’.” Of course, sometimes damage will be superficial and won’t affect your gear’s performance. Simpson says, “if your favourite hiking shirt has a few holes in it, no worries, you can continue to use it and earn some more rips and tears.” Fry suggests inspecting gear after each trip, and if you spot any serious issues – like broken zips – be sure to take it straight to a specialist repair place. That way you won’t have time to forget about the problem before the next adventure.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Happy campers: how to care for hiking gear, even in the pouring rain",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/29/happy-campers-how-to-care-for-hiking-gear-even-in-the-pouring-rain
3/29/2022,"Only 12 months ago government frontbenchers from the prime minister down were warning the National Disability Insurance Scheme was becoming too costly. They promised to “fully fund” it but insisted sustainability reforms were needed. But despite this concern about the cost of a scheme that provides life-changing support to more than 500,000 people, the NDIS has not become the political football it was during and after last year’s budget period. Of course, this time, shortly after Tuesday’s budget there is a federal election. But those working in the sector will tell you that although government cost “blowout” warnings are no longer in the news, the issue has not faded away. In fact, critics point to an avalanche of anecdotal reports of cuts to individual NDIS packages to argue the agency running the scheme has simply taken its campaign to rein in its costs underground. Last year’s budget forecast the NDIS would hit $33.3bn in total costs by 2024–25, with more than half of that spending provided by the commonwealth. The share of funding covered by the commonwealth was also increasing. A separate NDIS Financial Sustainability Report, initially secret but later released in full, predicted it would cost $60bn a year by 2030. Those estimates have been treated with scepticism by the states and some experts who note the forecasts have varied significantly in recent years. Tuesday’s budget will provide updated forecasts on overall NDIS spending, but it’s unlikely to shed light on the veracity of “stealth” or “secret” cuts, as argued by Labor’s Bill Shorten and the sector. As disability advocate Elly Desmarchelier points out, because the number of people on the scheme continues to increase, so too will overall spending. The latest NDIS quarterly report does show the average plan budget fell by 4% in 2021 to about $68,000. Before that, the average plan had increased each year since 2018. While some report that support they’d previously received is being ripped away, others are still getting increases to their plans. The top line figures may mask what advocates say they are seeing on the ground, where some NDIS participants talk of cuts in the tens of thousands of dollars. The number of legal appeals of NDIS decisions, meanwhile, has increased by 400%. Desmarchelier, who lives with cerebral palsy, will be among the speakers in Canberra on Tuesday when the advocacy group Every Australian Counts launches a new campaign, Defend Our NDIS. It is set to take aim at the “unexplained plan cuts that are leaving people without critical support”. The national disability insurance agency (NDIA) denies there is a directive to cut plans. The campaign is backed by the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations, and National Disability Services, which represents NDIS providers. It will argue that talking only about the cost of the NDIS misses the bigger picture, including the economic benefits. “Without the NDIS I would not be able to work,” says Desmarchelier. “That would put pressure on my partner not to work full-time so we’d rely on Centrelink. That in one case study proves the point of the power of the NDIS. “That’s not everyone’s case. But even if employment is not in someone’s goals, [there is] just the power of having people [with disability] out in the community.” National Disability Services has already released research from the progressive thinktank Per Capita stating that the NDIS delivers $2.25 to the Australian economy for every dollar spent. On Tuesday, it will release further modelling estimating the economic benefit of the NDIS in each federal electorate. Laurie Leigh, NDS chief executive, says the modelling “reinforces the NDIS must be seen as more than just a cost line in the budget – it is an investment in people and communities”. Desmarchelier adds: “What we need to remember is the issues in the NDIS aren’t just about money. It is about attitude and respect.” Desmarchelier was forced to wait for the NDIA to approve a new plan so she could afford the cost of catheter bags, which she needed after she was forced to have bladder surgery last year. In the end, without enough money to buy them herself and still waiting on the NDIA, she had no choice but to head to a public hospital to ask them for enough supplies to tide her over for a week. Then, when the plan finally came through, it funded only half the amount that Desmarchelier’s urology nurse had said was needed in a report provided to the NDIS. When she complained, Desmarchelier says she was told that she could wash the catheter bags and that the agency had “used the standard amount for someone of your age and your condition”. She was confused why the agency had not heeded the advice in the reports she’d provided. Desmarchelier expects to run out of catheter bags in June. “I have been in ICU as a result of a bladder infection,” Desmarchelier says. “I’m not out there trying to get diamond-encrusted catheter bags. They had been so penny pinching they had refused to see that I could need something different.” Last year, the commonwealth scrapped the controversial cost-saving “independent assessments” proposal aimed at ensuring more consistent decision-making within the scheme. It also ditched possible changes to the NDIS Act which may have set boundaries on what the NDIS would – and more pertinently would not – fund. It’s now undergoing a “co-design” reform process with the disability community. Those outcomes are unlikely to emerge until after the federal election. Peak body People With Disability Australia also has a list of budget demands. It included a “fully funded NDIS”, improved emergency planning and support for people with disability and money to improve Covid safety for people with disability. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The group’s fourth demand is more money for disability advocacy services. This goes to the heart of a growing problem caused by the cuts to funding packages. Amid the apparent increase in cuts to packages, disability advocacy services are overwhelmed. People with disability are struggling to get support to challenge the agency’s decisions to cut their funding. Some services have closed their books to new clients. Many of those individuals do not have the same resources or capacity as Desmarchelier. “If this can happen to me, when I have all the resources in the world, I can’t even imagine the type of cuts and decisions that are being made to people with disability who are segregated, who are isolated, who don’t have a voice,” she says.",News/Australia news,Coalition rhetoric on NDIS ‘blowout’ cools as election looms but critics say crucial support still being cut,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/coalition-rhetoric-on-ndis-blowout-cools-as-election-looms-but-critics-say-crucial-support-still-being-cut
3/29/2022,"The faces of fossil fuel executives – and their lobbyists and political advocates –are right now lit up with a healthy, happy glow. Russia’s illegal and murderous offensive against Ukraine has shattered the global politics of carbon to the immediate benefit of those selling fossil fuel products. A decent proportion of Putin’s war machine is funded by coal, oil and gas exports, and makes sense as a target for sanctions. But these substances have also become hard to dislodge from society – thanks in no small part to decades of active climate delay. The bulk of the response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis has been a move to replace dangerous energy from Russia with dangerous energy from elsewhere. In the UK, Boris Johnson compared Vladimir Putin to a drug dealer who’d got the west “hooked on hydrocarbons” … and then proceeded to plead with Saudi Arabia (who recently executed 81 men in 24 hours) to increase oil production. In the US, president Joe Biden boasted of record levels of fossil fuel production and signed a deal with the EU to ramp up fossil fuel exports to the region. And on Tuesday last week, Australia’s energy minister, Angus Taylor, announced $50m in funding for new domestic gas projects, explicitly linking the need to increase local supply of fossil fuels to the war in Europe. Never mind that both Australia and the US are huge exporters of gas, but drill we must. The calls for increased production are awkward for the industry, who would rather talk about intent without changing anything. CNN recently revealed recordings of shareholder calls with major overseas companies admitting they would rather keep production low and cash in on crippling energy prices to reward shareholders. Oil and gas producers are in their Goldilocks zone: demand for their products barely changes at all, they keep getting bags of taxpayer cash, and they carefully limit production to maintain prices at a crippling level. As was predictable, Taylor hasn’t held back in linking Australian fossil fuels to Ukraine. “I tell you what, I bet a number of countries in Europe right now wish they’d had a gas-fired recovery”, he told Sky News Australia earlier this month. He was talking up the Beetaloo Basin gas extraction project, one of the sites eligible for the new funding – but also a gasfield years off actually producing any gas and of limited use in the immediate squeeze generated by Russia’s invasion. Falcon Oil and Gas, which is 16% owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, is a minority partner in the Betaloo exploration. After several days of awkward silence, the Australian government sanctioned Vekselberg. The deeper heart of this story is that the simpleminded switching from Russian carbon to other carbon worsens reliance on conflict-ridden fuels, and helps warmongers strengthen their position. And Australia’s leadership team has set itself to deepening reliance on conflict fuels with extreme dedication in recent years. The Coalition’s May 2019 election campaign leaned heavily on an anti-electric-vehicle message, as did the prime minister’s (Scott Morrison engaged recently in an effort to deny this ever happened). Despite scaling back the attacks on non-fossil cars in the three years since, the Coalition has brought about no structural change in Australia’s terrible transport emissions. There is plenty of will, with many Australians keen to buy electric. But thanks to sustained policy inaction, the price of second-hand EVs is climbing, while months-long delays exist for new cars. For some time, transport emissions have been growing faster than population growth, and without any new policies, the government’s own forecasts show that these emissions will stagnate rather than fall. The Australian transport sector remains extremely vulnerable to price fluctuations for imported oil. The past decades of delay, obfuscation and denial from fossil industries means rising oil prices have a severe impact on Australians, and it’s likely to get worse even if petrol prices peak in coming weeks (the ever-expanding size of vehicles doesn’t help). It isn’t just oil that’s crippling Australian families at the moment. A quietly growing problem is that the coal and gas that still dominate Australia’s grid are both also becoming more expensive, resulting in higher electricity prices (as highlighted by RenewEconomy’s Michael Mazengarb on Twitter). While some of that is masked by the price-reducing impact of renewable energy, that effect isn’t limitless. Will be really interesting to see whether Federal Government re-runs its election scare campaign on electricity prices when prices are increasing and everyone in electricity sector knows that it's because of sky high coal and gas prices. https://t.co/ENEaUQQ8e9 Imagine if they’d spent the past three years enabling greater access to public transport, walking and cycling. Or if they’d created and deployed programs to make electric vehicles significantly more affordable to the vast numbers of people already keen to make the change. What if they’d truly dedicated themselves to uncoupling Australian life from fuels that cause conflict in their extraction, and atmospheric catastrophe in their usage? There are already tentative efforts to blend increased energy independence with rapid decarbonisation. Queensland has introduced subsidies for low-cost electric vehicles, and a recently-announced network of renewable hydrogen across Australia’s eastern states could fuel heavy transport and logistics. The Canberra Greens are pushing for a range of trials of ‘active transport’ options. The opportunities are plentiful and readily available. But without a federal acceleration, Australians will have no choice but to rely on a conflict-ridden, air-polluting and climate-disaster-causing fuel to power their lifestyles and move around. Instead of rescuing citizens from that disgusting and self-reinforcing trap, Australia’s leaders are openly and happily celebrating the crippling high prices for fossil fuels. Every crisis of the past – oil shocks, the collapse of the USSR, the GFC and Covid – placed a sad little dent in rising emissions, immediately followed by a continuation of the long-term trend. There is still time to make this one different. The atrocities being inflicted on the people of Ukraine must be stopped as soon as possible. Civilians are being slaughtered deliberately. Children are losing their lives. But Russia’s fossil-fuelled geopolitical strength won’t be truly countered if we just play musical chairs with our total reliance on climate-wrecking fuels. We must destroy the deeper system that’s in place. The one that locks us all into relying on fuels that sandwich a brief moment of benefit between conflict-ridden extraction and physically destructive usage.",News/Australia news,Russia’s murderous regime is propped up by oil and gas – Australia must switch | Ketan Joshi,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/russias-murderous-regime-is-propped-up-by-oil-and-gas-australia-and-the-world-must-switch
3/29/2022,"Eighteen days after Northern Territory police officer Zachary Rolfe was cleared of murdering Kumanjayi Walker, attention is turning to another court proceeding – an early hearing regarding the coronial inquest into the Warlpiri man’s death. Acting NT coroner Elisabeth Armitage will hold an inquest into the death in September but a directions hearing on Tuesday may give an insight into the extent of issues she will investigate. Rolfe shot Walker three times while trying to arrest him on 9 November 2019 in Yuendumu about 300km from Alice Springs. A jury unanimously found him not guilty of murder and two alternative charges on 11 March this year after a six-week trial in the NT supreme court. Rolfe’s supporters, including his lawyers and the NT police association, and Walker’s family, Warlpiri elders, and the prosecution commented after the verdict that the inquest could provide clarity about what they viewed as unresolved matters regarding the death. Prosecutor Philip Strickland SC said the trial had not been able to explore every issue raised by the shooting. “We anticipate that those issues, and the evidence that could not be examined in this trial, will be very carefully scrutinised at the inquest,” he said. “It is our view that the family of Kumanjayi Walker, and the Warlpiri community, and indeed the Australian people deserve no less than that full scrutiny.” Those issues include a suggested ban on guns in remote communities, concerns about why the heavily-armed immediate response team – a semi-tactical group of which Rolfe was a member – deployed to Yuendumu, and of the chain of command and procedures governing the deployment. Questions about the police investigation into Rolfe and alleged political interference in the decision to charge him are unlikely to feature in the inquest, but the NT Independent Commissioner Against Corruption is considering an inquiry into the matter, following calls from the territory opposition. “I am presently considering whether I should inquire into the circumstances of the investigation and arrest of Mr Rolfe,” commissioner Michael Riches said in a statement earlier this month. “While I appreciate the public interest in the matter I will not be rushed to decide whether or not I will investigate.” The NT chief minister Michael Gunner told the ABC last week that any suggestion he had interfered in the case – including a suggestion of such interference made by Rolfe – was “absolutely untrue and probably [legally] actionable”. Gunner also said he believed the IRT had been disbanded since the shooting but NT police said the unit had been suspended and its future was being reviewed. Gunner also used the ABC interview to say he did not back the call to ban guns in remote communities – a position echoed by the NT police association. Multiple families from Yuendumu will be represented by lawyers at the inquest. Guardian Australia understands they will press Armitage to inquire into Rolfe’s alleged history within the force prior to the arrest of Walker. Since the verdict, details have emerged of four cases involving Rolfe in which he was alleged to have used unreasonable force. No adverse findings have been made against Rolfe in relation to any of the cases – which emerged as part of a review of hundreds of arrests he had been involved in that was conducted as part of the murder investigation. Justice John Burns, who presided over the trial, ruled that evidence of the prior cases was inadmissible, as it would not assist the jury in reaching a verdict about whether Rolfe had murdered Walker. He found, in a phrase picked up by the defence, that the prosecution had “cherry picked” the arrests which they viewed as most relevant, but potentially discarded dozens more in which there had been no incident. He found the previous cases were not relevant to the shooting.",News/Australia news,Evidence not examined in Zachary Rolfe trial could be scrutinised at Kumanjayi Walker’s inquest,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/evidence-not-examined-in-zachary-rolfe-trial-could-be-scrutinised-at-kumanjayi-walkers-inquest
3/29/2022,"Qantas says it is concerned about the message sent by the Fair Work Commission after it ordered the airline to reinstate a male safety instructor who it fired for allegedly staring at a female colleague’s chest for 10 seconds. The commission’s ruling related to an aviation safety training session run for six Qantas employees in January 2021, where the instructor demonstrated how to observe a person’s breathing patterns to determine whether they required medical attention. The male safety instructor was said to have been explaining relevant first aid scenarios to the participants when he allegedly stopped in front of a female employee who was sitting about 1.5 metres away and stared into her eyes for about 10 seconds. It was then alleged that he moved his gaze towards her chest, where his eyes remained focused for about 10-20 seconds. He is alleged to have remained silent. The female complainant said: “It felt like a lifetime. This made me feel uncomfortable and it felt awkward. There was absolute silence in the class.” She claimed that shortly after this, the instructor said “you may have noticed that I was deliberately staring at [the female employee’s] chest to see if she was breathing”. The instructor denied using those words. The employee, who had been wearing a T-shirt with “some form of a scooped neckline”, then took her cardigan out and buttoned it up fully, before telling the instructor he had made her feel uncomfortable. She claimed he did not take her concern seriously. However, fair work commissioner Donna McKenna sided with the sacked safety instructor, late last week rejecting the notion his actions constituted harassment or “any form of ogling or similar”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The sacked safety instructor claimed that he only looked at the employee’s chest area for two to three seconds and commissioner McKenna agreed with his claim that his “principal point of visual focus” was on the exposed skin above the line of the T-shirt. “I doubt it would have been possible to visually focus – as if with some type of laser-point precision – solely or exclusively on the upper chest area above the scooped neck of the complainant’s T-shirt line, without that focus also incidentally encompassing the complainant’s breast area or at least the upper parts of her breasts/breast area,” the commissioner said. McKenna found in Thursday’s ruling that the instructor’s “estimate is more reliable than the complainant’s estimate concerning length of time concerning the chest staring/looking”. The safety instructor was ultimately dismissed in August however McKenna ordered he be reinstated and back paid. McKenna noted the interaction at the centre of the allegations was “brief”, “physically well-distanced” and “first aid-specific”. “The applicant did not, for example, physically demonstrate the Heimlich manoeuvre on a class participant without first asking for a volunteer or seeking permission,” she said. She found Qantas’s submission that the safety instructor had a “lack of insight and contrition” and had a “disciplinary history” was not relevant. McKenna accepted the sacked safety instructor’s submission that not “every moment of offence caused generates a valid reason for dismissal”. Qantas plans to appeal the decision, a spokesperson for the airline said on Monday. “We’re very disappointed and concerned about the message this judgment sends. Everyone has the right to feel safe and respected when they come to work.”",News/Business,Qantas concerned by order to reinstate safety instructor fired for allegedly staring at colleague’s chest,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/29/qantas-concerned-by-order-to-reinstate-safety-instructor-fired-for-allegedly-staring-at-colleagues-chest
3/29/2022,"Just 15% of projects announced in the government’s multi-billion infrastructure budget splurge have been endorsed as priorities by Infrastructure Australia, with the Coalition instead funnelling billions of dollars into must-win marginal seats. A Guardian Australia analysis of the 144 projects being funded by the government in Tuesday’s budget shows that just 21 are included on Infrastructure Australia’s current list of priority projects, accounting for $5.7bn of the approximate $16bn in new funding. The IA list is maintained “to ensure that public funds are directed towards projects that will deliver the best outcomes for our growing communities”, with the list prepared after “rigorous and independent analysis”. Almost $10bn in funding spread across 120 projects was not recommended by Infrastructure Australia – accounting for 82% of the total spend – with the bulk of this going to projects that span multiple electorates. The analysis also shows that of the $6.4bn that is allocated to projects within a single electorate, more than half – $3.3bn – is directed to marginal seats. This compares with fairly safe and safe seat groups, which received $1.2bn and $1.9bn respectively. The largest single project is a $1bn commitment to faster rail between Sydney and Newcastle with the federal contribution to upgrade stations and rail lines at Wyong and Tuggerah, along with new bridges over the Wyong River. The faster rail project is one of those included on Infrastructure Australia’s priority list. The spend is in the central coast seat of Dobell, which is among Labor’s most marginal and one that the Coalition is targeting at the forthcoming election. Dobell will also benefit from $336m in new funding for Pacific highway upgrades through Wyong town centre, and a separate $51m highway upgrade in Wamberal. Urban infrastructure minister, Paul Fletcher, said the rail upgrade would contribute towards “faster, more frequent and more reliable services” between Sydney and Newcastle which he said was the busiest regional passenger rail corridor in Australia. In the NSW marginal seat of Gilmore, which the government is hoping it can claw back from Labor with former NSW transport minister Andrew Constance running as its candidate, the Coalition will tip in an extra $352m for the Milton-Ulladulla bypass, bringing the federal government’s total commitment to the project to $752m. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Almost $250m will be spent in the western Sydney seat of Lindsay, held by the Labor party on a 1.1% margin. Seats in regional Queensland are also huge beneficiaries of the infrastructure cash splash, with almost $140m going to road projects in Flynn, Capricornia, Longman and Leichhardt. Just one of these projects worth about $10m was recommended by Infrastructure Australia. In Tasmania, $530m has been allocated to the three marginal seats of Bass, Braddon and Lyons, with the largest allocation being a $336m regional roads package for the north-east of the state. The Liberal MP for the seat of Bass, Bridget Archer, was spruiking the roads funding on her Facebook page on Monday, saying it would lead to “safer roads, reduced congestion, improved freight transport and getting from A to B faster”. She said a separate $56m had been secured for the seat after she had “heavily advocated for further funds to be committed” for the Sideling highway. Western Australian marginal seats are also set to benefit, with Pearce and Hasluck to share in $240m for road and Metronet upgrades. The commuter car park program, which was criticised by the auditor general for political bias – will also receive a slice of the funding, with an extra $47m allocated across five projects in the marginal seats of Robertson, Dunkley, Lindsay and Banks, and in Goldstein in Victoria, where Liberal MP Tim Wilson is facing a challenge from independent Zoe Daniel. The package also shows the influence of the Nationals on the government’s funding decisions, with a massive $3.1bn going towards the Melbourne Intermodal Terminal project in Victoria which will service the inland rail project that has been vigorously pursued by deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce. More regional development projects are expected to be unveiled in Tuesday’s budget. On Monday, when asked whether the government could guarantee that the infrastructure spend would not be directed to marginal seats, the finance minister Simon Birmingham said the package was spread “across a range of different environments around the country”. “This money comprises funding for major new intermodal terminals in Victoria, which are part of the inland rail that we’ve been building over a number of years – those major new terminals sit squarely in the heart of safe Labor electorates,” Birmingham told the ABC. “It includes funding for faster rail services to the Sunshine Coast, which would usually be classified as safer Liberal electorates. It contains funding across a range of different environments around the country to deliver the infrastructure needs our country has.” He said that the government had made the funding decisions “on the basis of where it’s going to deliver productivity gains for the country.” Birmingham said the funds for the car park projects represented just 0.3% of the total spend. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, was also asked whether the infrastructure package was targeting marginal seats, to which he replied: “It’s targeting the strength of our economy because that’s what Australians need.” Neither Joyce nor Fletcher responded to Guardian Australia’s request for comment on the approval of projects that had not been endorsed by Infrastructure Australia.",News/Australia news,Analysis reveals Morrison government funnelling billions into must-win marginal seats,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/analysis-reveals-morrison-government-funnelling-billions-into-must-win-marginal-seats
3/29/2022,"Close games and exciting finishes have been a highlight of the Cricket World Cup so far, but it seems Australia have no interest in anything less than total domination. Even when the opposition have felt like they are in with a chance, whether it is through a strong batting performance to set a record total for a chase or taking multiple quick wickets to see off the top order cheaply, Meg Lanning’s side simply refuses to be beaten. What kind of person, then does it take to walk into a team this dominant and not only hold her own, but excel? Enter Alana King, the 26-year-old leg spinner who was selected in the team for the Ashes after an ACL injury ruled out incumbent Georgia Wareham. Unlike some of the teenage quicks who burst onto the scene each summer in the Women’s Big Bash League, King did not appear as if from nowhere. Over the seven seasons of the WBBL, she gradually imprinted herself on the public consciousness until she became a familiar face. King believes this more gradual rise has been instrumental to her success. “People will get their opportunities at different times,” she says from the Australian team’s base in Wellington. “I’ve obviously had to wait a few more years than others, but it’s meant that I’m really happy with where I am and I’m confident in where my cricket is. I think you’ve got to, first and foremost, be comfortable in your own skin. And I have done that over the last few years.” It is that confidence in herself that allows King to be so calm. When the pressure started to build in the game against South Africa and none of the six previous bowlers had been able to break the opening partnership, King was thrilled to be given the opportunity. “To be honest, I think I’ve been blessed to be in those positions before whether it was at the Stars or the Scorchers,” she said. “I love to get the ball thrown to me in those type of situations, I think it really brings the best out in me, because you’ve got to be on from ball one. And I really like that challenge.” That aspect of her personality shines through in the way she approaches the difficult art of leg spin. While she had role models from her older brother to the king of spin himself Shane Warne, it was her willingness to embrace difference that first set her on that path. “I just realised that everyone was bowling pace, I want to do something different,” she said. “I want to do something different” could well be the motto for King’s career. In every moment she is completely authentic and has no interest in compromising her beliefs to fit in with the crowd. Over the past two seasons of the WBBL King, whose parents hail from Chennai in India, has consistently taken a knee before each game – even though many of her teammates have chosen not to. The eradication of racism and discrimination is a cause she believes in passionately. “It’s to represent my family and what they’ve been through,” she says. “I think having immigrant parents who moved over to Australia in the 80s, they faced a fair bit of discrimination. This is me standing up for them because they went through a lot.” While she may sometimes be a lone figure in making this symbolic gesture, King feels supported by her teammates whether they stand or kneel with her. “When I’ve spoken to the team regarding why I want to do it, I’ve had nothing but full support,” she says. “Just before the WBBL this season it was raised again, and I was happy to speak to the group and told them why I want to do it and what it means to me. I think it can be quite powerful when you’ve got your whole team around you supporting what you’re doing.” The ever-increasing visibility of the WBBL and women’s cricket more broadly has been important to King, not just for her own career, but because of the opportunities it offers to educate and raise awareness of the effects of racism and discrimination for people all over the world. As her own platform has increased as a result of breaking into the Australian team and making her mark on one of the world’s biggest stages, she has taken the time to reflect on how she can use that influence. While she belonged to a junior club that was diverse and inclusive, she knows that in many places in Australia, cricket has been a predominantly white sport. King hopes she can show people that is changing. “You’ve got to use the platforms you’re on,” she says. “If I can inspire the younger generation of subcontinent kids to pick up a bat and ball and to aspire to play for Australia, even though they’re from a subcontinent background, that’s one thing that I’m really passionate about.” “Knowing that they can play for this beautiful country that we live in and they’ve got role models that they can look up to, whether it’s Usman Khawaja in the men’s team or myself in the women’s team, I think that’s big.” In the immediate future, King’s thoughts are firmly on Wednesday’s semi-final against the West Indies and the opportunity to help propel Australia to a desperately sought World Cup win with her ability to take wickets in key moments. But her passion, determination and willingness to stand out from the crowd means that her long-term future is destined to be even more exciting – both on and off the field.",Sport/Sport,Australia’s spin queen Alana King: ‘I want to do something different’ | Megan Maurice,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/29/australias-spin-queen-alana-king-i-want-to-do-something-different
3/29/2022,"Dogs, diseases and droughts – aided and abetted by land clearing and bushfires – have pushed vulnerable koala populations into rapid decline. It is now hoped that a two-year-old koala named Jagger can help secure the fate of endangered colonies along Australia’s east coast. Jagger is the first koala to be bred as part of the Living Koala Genome Bank pilot program, led by the University of Queensland (UQ), and was on Friday released into Elanora Conservation Park on the Gold Coast. “Jagger is disease-free, has been fully vaccinated against chlamydia and – thanks to his diverse genetics – will protect koalas against the dangers of inbreeding,” UQ Associate Prof Stephen Johnston said. “He’s just one member of our recently completed pilot project … where we propagate koalas with high genetic merit to be released into the wild, improving genetic variation.” The pilot program, a collaboration between UQ, the Queensland University of Technology and the Dreamworld Wildlife Foundation, aimed to safeguard koalas against inbreeding and disease. “We’ve used proven breeding technologies in combination with an in-depth analyses of koala genetics and disease screening to help manage and conserve koala populations,” Johnston said. Queensland’s koala population has dropped by at least 50% since 2001 as a result of deforestation, drought and bushfires. The federal government listed the marsupial as endangered in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory in February – years after tens of thousands of koalas were killed in the 2019–20 Black Summer bushfires. Johnston said the primary threat to koalas in Queensland was habitat fragmentation, caused by land clearing and the development of roads and houses. He said this resulted in smaller numbers of koalas, heightening the risk of inbreeding. “Inbreeding … could result in deleterious alleles such as low fertility and diseases … as well as other abnormalities like scoliosis or cryptorchid testicles,” Johnston said. This is something the pilot program has sought to eliminate. But Johnston said there was “no point” in breeding healthy animals in captivity if they were unable to be released. “It’s really important to save habitat but as the population grows,” Johnston said. “We’ve got to find ways to coexist with koalas. “We’ve shown that we’ve got a set of tools that can be really useful for managing populations as they begin as they go into smaller fragmentations.” Johnston was hopeful that collaborations between zoos and universities could become a model to help the long-term conservation of koalas in the wild. “Excitingly, we have been able to demonstrate that zoos, in combination with expertise from universities, can significantly boost conservation outcomes,” he said. “Our hope is that we can now apply our concept to other wildlife parks in Queensland and possibly northern NSW, to safeguard the future of koalas, and we’re currently consulting with government to do just that.”",News/Australia news,‘Diverse genetics’: Queensland researchers hope Jagger the koala will help protect his species,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/diverse-genetics-queensland-researchers-hope-jagger-the-koala-will-help-protect-his-species
3/29/2022,"Blithe Spirit opens – briefly, gloriously – with Celine Dion. Housemaid Edith (Megan Wilding) sits at a piano and lowers her hand to the keys. The dramatic opening notes of It’s All Coming Back to Me Now ring out through the Sydney Opera HouseDrama Theatre. Then we get our first glimpse of her: Elvira, the dead first wife of uppity novelist Charles Condomine. She’s otherworldly, she’s beautiful, and – as played here by Shane Jenek, better known as drag queen Courtney Act – she’s a vision in pop melodrama. While a Dion song might seem an odd choice to open Nöel Coward’s 1941 farce, even a very camp production that features two drag performances, the legendary songwriter Jim Steinman said the song was about “dead things coming to life”. That’s what more or less what happens in Blithe Spirit: Charles (Matt Day) throws a dinner party, after which the main form of entertainment is a séance led by local medium Madame Arcati (Brigid Zengeni). But there’s a problem: Elvira’s ghost has shown up and she has no intention of leaving. Ruth, the new Mrs Condomine (Bessie Holland), can’t see or hear Elvira – but she can see her husband falling all over himself to complain about, flirt with, and even take Elvira to the pictures. More perceptive, witty, and strong-minded than her husband, Holland’s Ruth – a sharp comic delight – attempts to fix the situation and neutralise the ghost. Director Paige Rattray helms a Sydney Theatre Company production that revels in humour. It isn’t just Elvira who is played in drag: Dr Bradman, the Condomines’ friend, is played by Tracy Mann, with a wonderful ginger beard and brows. Jenek isn’t the strongest actor – but in his decadently flowing robe, which he uses for dramatic punctuation of nearly every sentence, it almost doesn’t matter. He plays posing melodrama much more fluidly than farce, and his scenes with Day become a rising tide of exaggeration, with plenty of petulant flouncing from both parties. Day, an actor who knows how to balance out a scene partner, does manage to keep it grounded. But it’s Holland, Wilding and Zengeni who raise the most laughs most consistently, and they do it by melding subtlety with bold comedy. They’re the funniest people on stage – Holland is the star around which this production revolves – and the physical awareness they bring to their roles elevates the stakes of even the least flashy scenes. Charles Condomine might be the catalyst for the play’s plot, but it’s these women who make it sing. The set, designed by David Fleischer, is an elegant rendition of an upper-class home, packed with overblown markers of performative masculinity. A phallic fountain trickles in the back; a mounted deer head hangs over the bar cabinet; a statue of man’s best friend, a dog sitting alert and upright, keeps steadfast watch next to the fireplace. It’s a home so clearly curated by bourgeois male ego that it’s beyond enjoyable to watch the play’s famously destructive ending tear it all apart. Clemence Williams sculpts and shapes the laughs with her composition and sound design; her cleverly bright cues descending when necessary into ghoulish notes of displeasure. Damien Cooper’s sumptuous lighting illuminates the smallest of jokes; he doesn’t miss a moment of Edith’s faces, her tiny grimaces providing a running commentary on her employers’ ridiculous behaviour.And the play’s magic and illusions consultant Adam Mada makes the moments of spiritualism sparkle. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning At two hours and 40 minutes (including an interval), the production feels a little long, and still seems to be discovering its own pacing: it luxuriates in witty first-act dialogue for so long that more visual moments, like the second act’s cavalcade of attempted exorcisms, feel rushed to save time. The second act is zippier, jettisoning most of the theatrical affectations in the first– but then the playful moments of the first act, like the sudden lip syncs, are much missed. As a result, the play feels disjointed. But it’s hard to care too much when there are plenty of immediate pleasures. The costumes and the wigs (by Benjamin Moir) are gorgeous and the laughs come easily, often by surprise. Rattray has found all the juice left in an 81-year-old comedy and delights in serving it to us. It’s almost irresistible.
