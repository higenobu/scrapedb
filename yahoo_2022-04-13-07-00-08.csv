""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below."" The United States Space Command (USSC) has confirmed a 2014 study from a team of astronomers, noting that government sensors did, in fact, detect a meteor on Earth that originated outside our Solar System. The rock is only the third interstellar object ever detected in our system, and the first to enter our atmosphere. After scientists publish their research on this meteoric discovery, they may be able to learn more about its contents. Government sensors on the hunt for fireballs plunging toward Earth have so far logged about 1,000 meteors and asteroids. But only one of them can boast that it traveled through our atmosphere from outside our own Solar System. This fireball, which shot through our atmosphere over Papua New Guinea in 2014, was no ordinary space rock‚Äîit was actually an interstellar meteor, the first ever known to originate outside our system and arrive on Earth. Rocketing at a speed of over 130,000 miles per hour, the rock broke up during its descent, probably scattering interstellar debris into the South Pacific Ocean. üí´ You love the cosmos. So do we. Let‚Äôs nerd out over it together. Confirmation of its distant origins arrived only recently, when the United States Space Command (USSC) released a memo on April 6, confirming that the meteor was indeed an interstellar object.
 5/ From the @AsteroidWatch tabletop exercise earlier this year, we learned that as long as the simulated asteroid was in the space domain, #USSPACECOM was the supported combatant command within the @DeptofDefense. ‚Äî U.S. Space Command (@US_SpaceCom) April 6, 2022 Before USSC confirmed this meteor was a distant stranger, all previous rocky bodies that fell to Earth were thought to have originated in our own Solar System. Many of them do come from a colony of millions of other rocks in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter, some 111.5 million miles from Earth.
 Two Harvard University researchers were the first to study the 2014 meteor‚Äôs distant origin, posting their research on the preprint server arXiv back in 2019 (meaning it was not peer-reviewed at the time). The meteor‚Äôs unusually high speed ‚Äúimplies a possible origin from the deep interior of a planetary system or a star in the thick disk of the Milky Way galaxy,‚Äù the researchers state in the study, which will be resubmitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in light of the recent confirmation. The researchers combed through records of all the fireballs that U.S. government sensors have detected since 1988. One of the researchers, Amir Siraj, wants to find meteor debris scattered on the ocean floor. It may be impossible, given the speed of the disintegrating object‚Äîwhich was only a few feet wide‚Äîand the minute pieces that probably resulted from the impact. ‚ÄúWe are currently investigating the possibility of embarking on an ocean expedition to recover the first interstellar meteorite. If found, extensive analysis will be conducted on the sample to understand its origin and the information it carries about its parent system,‚Äù he tells Popular Mechanics by email. ‚ÄúAt first, I could hardly believe the discovery, since astronomers had been searching for an interstellar meteor since 1950 or earlier,‚Äù says Siraj, who is director of Interstellar Object Studies at Harvard‚Äôs Galileo Project, which aims to look for extraterrestrial technological artifacts. Siraj and his Harvard colleague Avi Loeb, who leads the Galileo Project, originally submitted the discovery to The Astrophysical Journal Letters. However, the review process dragged on for years due to missing information that the U.S. government withheld from the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) database, which identifies objects like meteors and asteroids and calculates their odds of hitting Earth. The U.S. Department of Defense operates some of the sensors that detect fireballs in order to monitor the skies for nuclear detonations, so Siraj and Loeb couldn‚Äôt directly confirm the margin of error on the fireball‚Äôs velocity. After moving through NASA, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and several bureaucratic departments, the sensor data finally ended up with Joel Mozer, chief scientist of Space Operations Command at the U.S. Space Force. Mozer released the memo confirming that ‚Äúthe velocity estimate reported to NASA is sufficiently accurate to indicate an interstellar trajectory.‚Äù Siraj learned the good news through a NASA scientist‚Äôs April 6 tweet. Now, he is in the process of revising the paper, taking into account the government confirmation. ‚ÄúThis confirmed impact of an interstellar object with the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere implies that similar objects are very common throughout space, which of course raises interesting questions about how they are ejected in such large quantities from their parent systems,‚Äù he says. Even if the remnants of the rock are never found, data from the meteor‚Äôs fiery descent could hold clues to its composition, and maybe origins. The chances of a rock from another star system coming close to Earth are rare, but astronomers knew of two other interstellar objects before this recently-confirmed discovery. Quarter-mile-long asteroid Oumuamua was the first confirmed interstellar object identified in the Solar System; Pan-STARRS, a wide-field astronomical imaging system in Hawaii, detected the massive rock in 2017. Amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov spotted Comet Borisov with his telescope in 2019. It‚Äôs the first confirmed comet to enter our solar system from some unknown place beyond our sun‚Äôs influence, according to NASA. Neither of these distant visitors flew close to Earth, though. Expanding our sensory capabilities with efforts like the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory‚Äôs planned ten-year survey is critical to ‚Äúenhance our discovery rate of interstellar objects,‚Äù Siraj writes in an arXiv post in November 2021. Who knows? We may even find extra-galactic objects, like the 2007 discovery of a particle that originated outside the Milky Way.

Medvedchuk was under house arrest until late February while facing treason charges but escaped. He has close ties to Putin and was thought to be the Russian leader's top pick to be a puppet leader in Ukraine. Pro-Putin Ukrainian politician Viktor Medvedchuk has been arrested, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced Tuesday. Medvedchuk, the leader of Ukraine's Opposition Platform ‚Äî For Life party, had been on house arrest while facing charges of treason until he escaped in late February. Ukraine's Security Service tweeted a picture of Medvedchuk in handcuffs wearing what appeared to be Ukrainian army uniform. The tweet said, ""You can be a pro-Russian politician and work for the aggressor state for years. You may be hiding from justice lately. You can even wear a Ukrainian military uniform for camouflage‚Ä¶But will it help you escape punishment? Not at all! Shackles are waiting for you."" ‚Äî–°–ë –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ (@ServiceSsu) April 12, 2022 Medvedchuk was thought to be Russian President Vladimir Putin's top choice as a replacement for Zelenskyy to serve as Ukraine's puppet ruler. If Russia had taken Kyiv, many experts believe Medvedchuk would've been installed as the new leader of Ukraine. He has extremely close ties to Putin ‚Äî the Russian leader is godfather to Medvedchuk's daughter and the two men have vacationed together. ""Our relationship has developed over 20 years,"" Medvedchuk said of his ties to Putin during an interview with Time last spring. ""I don't want to say I exploit that relationship, but you could say it has been part of my political arsenal."" Following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, Medvedchuk was sanctioned by the US. The Obama administration accused him of undermining democracy in Ukraine. After Medvedchuk was placed on house arrest last May, Putin said Ukraine was being morphed into ""some kind of anti-Russia."" ""So what, everyone who's working with Russia will now face criminal prosecution in Ukraine?"" Putin said at the time, per the Moscow Times. Medvedchuk is one of the wealthiest people in Ukraine, estimated to be worth $620 million. His proximity to Putin helped make Medvedchuk rich. Zelenskyy in February 2021 signed a decree that froze Medvedchuk's assets and shut down three television stations associated with the Ukrainian multimillionaire, alleging that they were spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda.

4/13/2022,"STORY: In his first public remarks since Russian soldiers retreated from several Ukrainian cities to refocus their assault on the country's east, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the invasion was going as planned... that peace-talks between Moscow and Kyiv had hit a dead-end... and that the bodies of Ukrainian civilians found in the city of Bucha had been staged. Putin offered no evidence to support this allegation. But while the Russian leader called the piles of corpses in Bucha fake, investigators here were painstakingly combing the scene for the facts. This group from the French Gendarmerie's forensic science department watched workers in hazmat suits digg earth from a shallow grave, then lift out a heavy mass wrapped in an orange blanket. The burnt body parts inside, allegedly those of a woman and her two children, were too charred to tell apart. Here's Ukrainian prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktov. ""We have now a lot of job unfortunately with war crimes, war crimes against humanity. Today you were all witnesses where we were digging out three bodies of a family. Witnesses told that it was a woman and her two kids, we don‚Äôt know who are they. We will identify them by our procedural possibilities and maybe with our French colleagues."" The mayor of Bucha on Tuesday said 403 bodies had been found so far. Russian troops occupied Bucha for several weeks before they withdrew. Satellite imagery appears to show bodies laying in the streets while the town was under Russian control. One of the mass graves was outside this church. Priest Andriy Halavin said that during the Russian occupation, in early March, the dead began to accumulate, and needed to be buried somewhere. ""Animals were running around, you know what could have happened. And when the number of dead people got too high, it was important to bury them. We couldn't get to the cemetery, because they were shooting at cars. On March 10, the local government contacted us and asked if we minded burying people here."" Russian forces would remain in the city for almost three more weeks. Ukraine has accused the Russian military of executing residents. U.S. President Joe Biden has called Putin a ‚Äúwar criminal.‚Äù ""He is a war criminal."" Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February in what he called a ""special operation"". Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions in an effort to force Russia to withdraw its forces.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Putin calls Bucha killings 'fake' as bodies pile up,https://news.yahoo.com/putin-calls-bucha-killings-fake-200551704.html
