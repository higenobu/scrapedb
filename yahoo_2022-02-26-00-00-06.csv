2/26/2022,"An international relations expert is warning that the attacks on Ukraine by Russian forces will lead to dire consequences unless the leaders of other nations change how they deal with Russia - and that includes Canada. Russia is in the midst of invading Ukraine from land, sea and air, zeroing in on cities and military targets. Aurel Braun is a professor of international relations and political science at the University of Toronto, as well as an associate at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies Harvard University. He says so far, leaders in countries like the U.S. have used tactics that are too soft, which is why Russia is escalating its presence in the Ukraine. Unless we change our collective approach to Russia, we’re not going to be able to stop this. It’s likely to get worse. Not because Putin is some mad aggressor who wants to conquer countries all over the world, but because he’s an opportunist who will take whatever he can if he finds weakness.
Aurel Braun, Professor of International Relations and Political Science, University of Toronto It appears sanctions against Russia haven’t been enough. Braun says the lack of defence armament from other countries makes Ukraine a soft target. Meanwhile, diplomacy talks with the US have only appeared to make Putin more emboldened. Domestically, Canada is close to Ukraine because of the large diaspora that live here. When it comes to our role in the current situation, Canada has sent $7.8 million for lethal military equipment, which Braun says would add up to roughly three hours of ammunition. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has issued a first round of sanctions against Russia and more troops have been sent to Europe. About 400 Canadian troops have been stationed in Latvia for the last several years, which Braun says puts Canada closer to the frontlines. If Mr. Putin decides to attack Latvia, Canadians soldiers will die, it’s that basic,” he says. “This is very real for Canada. We’re not bystanders.
Aurel Braun, Professor of International Relations and Political Science, University of Toronto Another thing to consider is Canada’s geographical position across the Atlantic Ocean from Russia. The Arctic has become an important and contested area, thanks to its vast natural resources – 20 to 30 per cent of the world’s hydrocarbons are there. It's also an incredibly fragile ecological area, so that if an accident were to occur there, it would be catastrophic. Though Canada has banned any exploration in most areas of the Arctic, Russia has moved full steam ahead with exploration, since 60 per cent of their exports are hydrocarbons. “They’re not restrained by the Glasgow or Paris Agreements,” says Braun. “They’ve paid lip service to it, but in reality they’ve disregarded it...any accident would have horrific effects to the Canadian Arctic coastline.” Russia has militarized the Arctic since it’s becoming more of a strategic area for them, which directly affects Canada. “If we don’t deter Russia, Canada’s is going to be affected directly,” Braun says. “Materially, ecologically, and strategically.”",News/Yahoo News Canada,"'If we don’t deter Russia, Canada is going to be affected directly': Attacks on Ukraine could threaten security of Canada",https://news.yahoo.com/canada-russia-ukraine-war-impact-arctic-security-172703258.html

2/26/2022,"Referring to the Russia-Ukraine Crisis, Trump praised Putin as a “genius” and stated that “China is going to be next” under Biden’s watch.

In a recent interview with the conservative talk radio program “The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show,” former U.S. President Donald Trump confidently stated that “China is going to be next” and would “absolutely” be going after Taiwan.

He accused the Biden administration of being weak and assured the hosts that an invasion would “never have happened” under his own presidency. Trump also praised Putin as a “genius” for sending Russian troops into Ukraine under the guise of “peace keepers.” He stated, “Here’s a guy who’s very savvy.”

The hosts mocked President Joe Biden’s tweets from two years ago in which he wrote: “I’m the only person in this field who’s ever gone toe-to-toe with [Putin].” They claimed Russian invasions also took place under the Obama administration, suggesting the two leaders had weak positions on foreign policy.

As president, Trump was involved and invested in several Taiwanese affairs, especially in regards to military expansion. As an NPR article from 2020 pointed out, Trump made many efforts as president to forge a stronger partnership with Taiwan, including accepting a congratulatory call from Taiwan’s president on his win and dealing a multi-billion dollar arms sale with the Taiwanese military. Under his administration, a brand new $255 million dollar representative office was also opened in Taipei, the capital. Simultaneously during this time, Trump had continued to take an aggressive stance against trade with China by imposing tariffs.

China and Taiwan have had separate governments since 1949, when communists overtook the Republic of China in a civil war. They went on to set up the People’s Republic of China, whereas the members of the Republic of China fled to Taiwan to establish their own separate government. Taiwan continues to declare its independence, while China continues to claim it as its territory under its “One country, two systems” stance.

In response to comparisons of the Russia-Ukraine Crisis to the situation between China and Taiwan, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hya Chunying firmly reiterated China’s “One-China” sentiments by noting that “Taiwan is indeed not Ukraine” and would always remain an “inseparable” part of China’s territory. “This,” Hya continued, “is an irrefutable historical and legal fact.”

Tensions are on the rise as Taiwan’s need for military defense comes into question amidst an already strained relationship between it and China. China’s air force has been spotted circling Taiwan’s skies.

2/26/2022,"PARIS (Reuters) -France's foreign minister said that Russian President Vladimir Putin, when making threats about using nuclear weapons, needs to understand that NATO, too, is a nuclear alliance, but he ruled out NATO-led military intervention to defend Ukraine. Asked whether Putin's threat of ""such consequences that you have never encountered in your history"" was tantamount to threatening Russian use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said it was indeed understood as such. ""Yes, I think that Vladimir Putin must also understand that the Atlantic alliance is a nuclear alliance. That is all I will say about this,"" Le Drian said on Thursday on French television TF1. Speaking from the Kremlin on Thursday morning as he launched the Russian military's invasion of Ukraine, Putin said Russia would respond instantly if any external force tried to interfere with its actions. ""Whoever tries to hinder us, and even more so, to create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate. And it will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history,"" the Russian president said. Western leaders on Thursday threatened unprecedented economic sanctions against Russia, but none have argued for a NATO-led military intervention to defend Ukraine. Ukraine is not a NATO ally, and the alliance is not treaty-bound to protect it. Asked why NATO member states -- which in past decades have intervened militarily in non-NATO countries such as Afghanistan, Libya and former Yugoslavia -- are refusing to put soldiers on the ground in Ukraine, Le Drian said: ""That is not what the Ukrainians are asking us"". He said Ukraine is asking for humanitarian and financial help, as well as military equipment, which the West has provided and will continue to provide. Asked what weaponry NATO could provide, Le Drian said ""they have made a list and we are studying that list in order to meet their requests as soon as possible"". Asked whether Europe and NATO could continue to rule out a military response despite the presence of Russian soldiers in Ukraine and Putin's threat of nuclear apocalypse, Le Drian said sanctions will be more efficient. ""Strangling Russia economically and financially will in the long run be stronger than any intervention,"" the foreign minister said.

2/26/2022,"Sharks are notorious for chomping on hooked fish before anglers can reel them in, but one Australian fisherman learned the hard way that sharks will also eat other sharks, too. Jason Moyce — known as “Trapman Bermagui” on social media — had not one, but three sharks bitten in half as he pulled them in this week, including two hammerheads. It happened Tuesday, Feb. 22, off the coast of New South Wales in southern Australia, and Moyce posted photos of the three sharks with a series of complaints about his worsening luck. “Plenty of smooth hammerhead sharks around. But getting a whole one to the boat is a challenge,” the Trapman Bermagui Facebook page reported after it happened the second time. Then a dusky shark — also called a “bronzie” — was pulled in, missing everything beyond its front fins. Clearly, much bigger predators were nearby, he concluded. “Even the bronzies aren’t safe today,” he wrote. “No more shark fishing for us. Too many big units around.” Hungry sharks are known for “tail fishing boats” off Australia in search of easy meals, Moyce told 9news.com.au. However, in this case, it appeared the boat had attracted some rather large sharks. “There were just too many big ones,” Moyce told the station. “They were down deep, I couldn’t see them but I think they were tiger sharks.” Tiger sharks can reach nearly 11 feet off Australia, according to New South Whales government data. Moyce, “a second generation pro fisherman,” said he wasn’t the only one having troubles that day. Anglers on a recreational boat caught a mako shark and “found a smaller mako, bitten in two in its stomach,” according to a post on the Trapman Bermagui Facebook page. It included a photo of both sharks. Waters off Australia are home to about 170 species of shark, with the biggest concentration (50 species) living in the Coral Sea, according to Australiangeographic.com. Among them is the great white shark, a species linked to the Feb. 16 killing of diving instructor Simon Nellist as he swam near a Sydney Beach, the BBC reports.

On Wednesday morning, one York County camera was also good for catching a pair of men who appear to be stealing a road sign. A state Department of Transportation employee was doing a routine camera check and saw two men taking a sign on Interstate 83 in the area of the southbound Shrewsbury exit ramp, according to safety press officer Fritzi Schreffler. The camera showed two men clearly taking one of two signs from that spot and placing it in the back of a silver pickup.

The sign alone would cost $600 to replace, but that doesn't include the post or labor to install it, according to PennDOT. Schreffler said the PennDOT employee reported the incident to Pennsylvania State Police, who picked up the men. She said it’s highly unusual to capture something like this. “Usually we get stuff after the fact,” Schreffler said. “We get calls all of the time requesting video of crashes or whatever, but typically our cameras are facing the other way.” Each shift performs a run through all of the cameras to make sure they are working. PSP didn’t have the specifics of the incident when asked late Wednesday morning. After the men left their spot on the shoulder of I-83, they stopped in a lot next to a PennDOT stockpile to further secure the sign, Schreffler said.

2/26/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The chief of the German army vented his frustration over what he sees as the long-running neglect of military readiness in his country in an unusual public rant a few hours after Russia invaded Ukraine, adding that the army was in bad shape. Russian forces invaded Ukraine by land, air and sea on Thursday, confirming the worst fears of the West with the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two. ""In my 41th year of peace-time service, I would not have thought that I would have to experience a war,"" Lieutenant General Alfons Mais said on LinkedIn on Thursday. ""And the Bundeswehr, the army which I have the honour to command, is standing there more or less empty-handed. The options we can offer the government in support of the alliance are extremely limited."" Commentators on LinkedIn praised Mais for his ""brutally honest"" words, many of them backing his veiled criticism of consecutive German governments that have been blamed for not fulfilling NATO's targets for military spending. Germany in January offered to supply 5,000 military helmets to Ukraine to help defend against possible invasion - an offer Kyiv mayor and former world champion boxer Vitali Klitschko dismissed as ""a joke"". ""We have all seen it coming but were not able to get through with our arguments to draw the consequences after (Russia's) annexation of Crimea. This does not feel good. I am fed up with it,"" Mais said in his post. NATO territory had so far not come under direct threat, he said, but Germany's partners in Eastern Europe were feeling constantly rising pressure. ""When, if not now, is the moment to put the Afghanistan mission structurally and with regard to our equipment behind us and overhaul our posture?"" Mais said. ""Otherwise, we will not be able to successfully fulfil our constitutional duty and our obligations in the alliance."" German forces were drastically scaled down after the end of the Cold War, and later trained mainly for missions such as in Afghanistan where the adversary was poorly equipped and not an armed force with the most modern weapons. A spokesman for the German army declined to elaborate on Mais' criticism. ""We have nothing to add to the remarks of the chief of the army on LinkedIn at this moment.""

The Massachusetts college student had eaten rice, chicken and lo mein from a restaurant. Soon after, he felt abdominal pain and his skin turned a shade of purple, according to a report by The New England Journal of Medicine. The teenager was admitted to a hospital for ""shock, multiple organ failure, and rash,” and his condition quickly declined. He experienced abnormal breathing, high blood pressure and vomiting. The student had been healthy overall with regular drinking and smoking habits, the report said. After further tests, he was diagnosed with meningococcal purpura fulminan disease, which caused his stiff neck, nausea, respiratory collapse, shock and organ failure, according to the report. Purpura fulminan is a rare complication that comes with septic shock, which the college student experience, according to the report.

The Centers for Disease and Control Prevention warns it can “lead to death in as little as a few hours.” Over the course of his hospital stay, his condition worsened and he developed necrosis, the death of tissue and cells. At that point, doctors had to amputate his legs and fingers, according to the report. He also needed a pacemaker for 13 days to treat his cardiac dysfunction. Experts have warned against the dangers of improperly storing leftover rice because items such as rice and pasta contain a bacterium called Bacillus cereus. The bacteria produces a toxin when heated and left out too long, according to the CDC. In 2008, a teenager died in his sleep after eating leftover pasta that wasn't refrigerated overnight, a case that was reported in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology.

2/26/2022,"On Wednesday afternoon, just hours before Vladimir Putin launched a long-planned attack on Ukraine, a top White House official joined Yahoo Finance Live to preview the planned sanctions against Russia. Daleep Singh, White House Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics, underlined that the plan will be wide-ranging — and that crucial American economic allies will be on board to make the measures stick. His comments echo those made by White House press secretary Jen Psaki during her daily briefing on Wednesday afternoon. “What people need to understand is that we follow a set of guiding principles when we think about sanctions,” said Singh, who also serves as Deputy Director of the National Economic Council. “We're not cowboys applying arbitrary and capricious sanctions to the rest of the world.” President Joe Biden will provide more details early Thursday afternoon in a speech to the nation. In a statement Wednesday night, Biden said, “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way.” On energy spikes as a result of the war, Singh underlined that American consumers will face higher prices — but he said the costs to Russia will be much higher. Russia is the world's second-largest producer of natural gas and third-largest producer of crude oil. Singh said the U.S. sanctions wouldn't be designed to stop Russia oil exports — rather, cutting off the spigot there would be Putin’s choice. “It would be a terrible mistake for Russia to weaponize its oil supply,” he said. ""[Russia] depends on oil and gas revenues for its exports and for the Russian government's budget revenues.” If gas prices do spike more, one option would be releasing more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to alleviate prices, Psaki noted Wednesday. The sanctions to come are also set to focus largely on Russian finances — with more Russian financial institutions set to be targeted — as well as limits on the country's imports. For weeks, the Biden administration has suggested it could deploy export controls. Those controls would aim to ban foreign and domestic companies from sending Russia sought-after products like high-tech semiconductors. Speaking to Yahoo Finance on Wednesday, Singh attempted to address a key question about those proposed sanctions. Can the White House actually exert influence in this area when 100% of the world’s most advanced semiconductors are manufactured overseas? Indeed, three-quarters of global chip manufacturing capacity is now concentrated in East Asia. The rules “can only work in tandem with our allies and partners in Europe, but also in Asia,"" Singh acknowledged. “We know almost all of the leading-edge semiconductor chips are produced in Taiwan and Korea and what this rule allows us to do is to move in lockstep with our European partners as well as our Asian partners.” While U.S.-based companies like Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM) would fall directly under the controls, the focus in the coming weeks and months will likely be on whether companies like Samsung (based in South Korea) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company comply. The overall plan, says Singh, is “what we'll create is a negative feedback loop, a vicious feedback loop between capital outflows, a weaker currency, imported inflation, higher imported inflation, a hit to Russia's purchasing power, lower investment, and lower growth.” Ben Werschkul is a writer and producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.

2/26/2022,"PRAGUE (AP) — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shocked the former Soviet satellite states of Central and Eastern Europe, drawing strong condemnation even from the region’s most pro-Kremlin politicians. For some of the countries that fled the Soviet bloc following a series of anti-communist revolutions more than 30 years ago, footage of tanks and troops rolling in to punish a nation trying to pursue its own independent course looks painfully familiar. Two until now major pro-Russian voices in the European Union, Czech President Milos Zeman and Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, didn't mince their words in criticizing Moscow’s most aggressive action since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Their countries experienced comparable brutality — the Czech Republic, as part of Czechoslovakia, in 1968 and Hungary in 1956. Zeman called Thursday's invasion “an unprovoked act of aggression.” “Russia has committed a crime against peace,” he said in an address to the nation. Zeman had previously made news by calling Russia’s 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula “a fait accompli.” Many in the Czech Republic reviled Zeman as a “servant of Kremlin” after he sided with Russia and cast doubt on the findings of his own security and intelligence services on the alleged participation of Russian spies in a huge 2014 ammunition explosion. Until just days ago, Zeman was insisting that the Russians wouldn't attack Ukraine because “they aren’t lunatics to launch an operation that would be more damaging for them than beneficial.” “I admit I was wrong,” he said Thursday. Zeman has called for harsh sanctions against Russia, including cutting it out of the SWIFT financial system which shuffles money from bank to bank around the globe. “It’s necessary to isolate a lunatic and not just to defend ourselves by words but also by deeds,” he said. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala also voiced full support for the strongest possible sanctions for what he called “an absolutely unjustified act of aggression against a sovereign state.” Prague ordered the closure of two Russian consulates in the Czech Republic and stopped accepting visa requests from Russian citizens. Pavel Rychetsky, the chief judge at the Constitutional court, the country’s highest legal authority, suggested that a European arrest warrant should be issued against Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said Putin should be tried at the International Criminal Court for “an unprecedented unleashing of war on the European continent for the first time since World War II.” In Hungary, high ranking officials had for weeks avoided condemning Russia’s actions directly. Under Orban, the country has pursued close ties with Putin, a point of concern for many of Hungary’s western partners. Hungary has historically deeply distrusted Moscow, which ordered the brutal repression of an anti-Soviet uprising in 1956. But Orban in recent years has pursued a diplomatic and economic strategy he calls “Eastern Opening,” which favors closer ties with countries to the east, and in his frequent battles with the EU has called the 27-nation bloc an oppressive imperial power similar to Hungary’s former Soviet occupiers. But on Thursday, Orban was clear in his condemnation of the Kremlin. “Russia attacked Ukraine this morning with military force,” Orban said in a video on Facebook. “Together with our European Union and NATO allies, we condemn Russia’s military action.” “Hungary’s position is clear: we stand by Ukraine, we stand by Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” his Foreign Minister Peter Szijijarto said. Bulgaria, Moscow’s closest ally during the Cold War, followed suit. “Having strategic bombers and missiles flying in Europe in the 21st century, assaults by air and sea against a sovereign state, is absolutely inadmissible,” President Rumen Radev said. Romania also stood staunchly with its western partners. “Through today’s cynical invasion, the Russian Federation is the architect of the worst security crisis since World War II,” the ruling coalition leaders said. Neighboring Moldova, a former Soviet republic and one of the few former communist Eastern European countries not to have joined NATO so far, echoed these views. Moldovan President Maia Sandu stressed that Russia’s attacks were launched “in violation of international norms,” adding that the international community “unanimously condemns these military actions.” ___ Justin Spike in Budapest, Hungary, Veselin Toskov in Sofia, Bulgaria and Stephen McGrath in Bucharest, Romania, contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"By invading Ukraine, Putin loses allies in eastern Europe",https://news.yahoo.com/invading-ukraine-putin-loses-allies-201605774.html
2/26/2022,"Putin's attire during his war declaration on Thursday suggests his speech may have been pretaped. Videos from Monday and Thursday appeared to show the Russian president wearing the same clothes. The videos showed Putin wearing a black blazer with a white dress shirt and a maroon tie. Russian President Vladimir Putin's attire during his Thursday war declaration suggests his speech may have been pretaped. In a video that aired early Thursday in Russia, Putin said he would launch a ""special military action"" against Ukraine. During a televised address on Monday, Putin appeared to wear the same outfit as he denounced Ukraine's sovereignty, argued that Ukraine was a creation of the Soviet Union, and announced military intervention in eastern Ukraine. In both videos, Putin appeared to be sitting in the same spot at the same table, wearing the same outfit: a black blazer with a white dress shirt and a maroon tie. The similar attire and location prompted speculation that the declaration of a military assault against Ukraine had been taped earlier. Some analysts cited metadata from an official video as evidence that the address was pretaped. However, Aric Toler, an analyst with the publication Bellingcat, said that this was based on data from a different video and that the Kremlin video's data showed a creation date of February 24, leaving it unclear when the video was filmed. Other elements of Russia's actions on Ukraine have been scrutinized over apparent timing discrepancies. Documents from separatist leaders in Luhansk and Donetsk requesting aid from Russia made public on Wednesday bore signatures from the day before. The Kremlin also acknowledged that a dramatic Security Council meeting in Moscow this week about deciding whether to recognize the separatist regions as independent states had been recorded five hours before it was broadcast. At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council late on Wednesday, Ukraine's ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, delivered a searing response to Putin's action. ""About 48 minutes ago, your president declared war on Ukraine,"" Kyslytsya said to Russia's ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya. Hours after Putin's declaration on Thursday, Ukrainian officials said the country was being targeted by airstrikes.   Read the original article on Business Insider",World/INSIDER,"Putin announced attacks against Ukraine on Thursday in the same suit he wore for his Monday speech, prompting speculation that his war declaration was pretaped",https://news.yahoo.com/putin-announced-attacks-against-ukraine-051653025.html
2/26/2022,"An entire garrison of 13 Ukrainian border guards was killed in the first day of fighting on the nation’s Snake Island after the soldiers refused to surrender to invading Russian forces, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Zelenskyy said in an address that the guards had attempted to protect the island, resisting demands from Russian forces to lay down their arms. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, posted audio to Facebook in which Russian forces can be heard telling the soldiers to surrender and “avoid bloodshed,” according to a translation by The Washington Post. The garrison refused, with one soldier saying, “Russian warship, go fuck yourself,” and were all killed in an artillery strike. Zelenskyy said the 13 soldiers would be honored posthumously with the Hero of Ukraine award. Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in #2WW years.

The Post noted that the island marks the edge of Ukraine’s territorial waters and serves as a strategic post in the Black Sea. Zelenskyy said at least 137 people have been killed in Ukraine since the beginning of Russia’s invasion and hundreds had been wounded. That tally was expected to climb as Russian forces closed in on the capital, Kyiv, and Zelenskyy said in his address that “the fate of the country depends fully on our army, security forces, all of our defenders.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

2/26/2022,"MOSCOW (AP) — Shocked Russians turned out by the thousands Thursday to decry their country's invasion of Ukraine as emotional calls for protests grew on social media. Some 1,745 people in 54 Russian cities were detained, at least 957 of them in Moscow. Hundreds of posts came pouring in condemning Moscow’s most aggressive actions since the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Vladimir Putin called the attack a “special military operation” to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine from “genocide” — a false claim the U.S. had predicted would be a pretext for invasion, and which many Russians roundly rejected. Tatyana Usmanova, an opposition activist in Moscow, wrote on Facebook that she thought she was dreaming when she awoke at 5:30 a.m. to the news, which she called “a disgrace that will be forever with us now.” “I want to ask Ukrainians for forgiveness. We didn’t vote for those who unleashed the war,” she said. There have been protests in different countries against the Russian attack on Ukraine. As sirens blasted in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, and large explosions were heard there and in other cities, Russians were signing open letters and online petitions demanding the Kremlin halt the assault, which the Ukrainian health minister said had killed at least 57 Ukrainians and wounded dozens more. “Public opinion is in shock, people are in shock,” political analyst Abbas Gallyamov told The Associated Press. One petition, started by a prominent human rights advocate, Lev Ponomavyov, garnered over 150,000 signatures within several hours and more than 330,000 by the end of the day. More than 250 journalists put their names on an open letter decrying the aggression. Another one was signed by some 250 scientists, while 194 municipal council members in Moscow and other cities signed a third. “I’m worried about the people very much, I’m worried to tears,” said Zoya Vorobey, a resident of Korolyov, a town outside Moscow, her voice cracking. “I’ve been watching television since this morning, every minute, to see if anything changes. Unfortunately, nothing.” Several Russian celebrities and public figures, including some working for state TV, spoke out against the attack. Yelena Kovalskaya, director of a state-funded Moscow theater, announced on Facebook she was quitting her job, saying “it's impossible to work for a killer and get paid by him.” ""I know that right now many of you feel desperation, helplessness, shame over Vladimir Putin's attack on the friendly nation of Ukraine. But I urge you not to despair,"" human rights activist Marina Litvinovich said in a video statement on Facebook, calling for mass protests Thursday evening. “We, the Russian people, are against the war Putin has unleashed. We don't support this war, it is being waged not on our behalf,” Litvinovich said. But the authorities were having none of that. In Moscow and other cities, they moved swiftly to crack down on critical voices. Litvinovich was detained outside of her residence shortly after posting the protest call. OVD-Info, a rights group that tracks political arrests, reported that 1,745 people in 54 cities had been detained by Thursday evening, at least 957 of them in Moscow. Russia's Investigative Committee issued a warning Thursday afternoon reminding Russians that unauthorized protests are against the law. Roskomnadzor, state communications and media watchdog, demanded that Russian media use “information and data they get only from official Russian sources.” Some media reported that employees of certain state-funded companies were instructed not to comment publicly on the events in Ukraine. Human rights advocates warned of a new wave of repression on dissent. “There will be new (criminal) cases involving subverters, spies, treason, prosecution for antiwar protests, there will be detentions of journalists and bloggers, those who authored critical posts on social media, bans on investigations of the situation in the army and so on,"" prominent human rights advocate Pavel Chikov wrote on Facebook. ""It is hard to say how big this new wave will be, given that everything has been suppressed already.” Despite the pressure from the authorities, more than 1,000 people gathered in the center of Moscow Thursday evening, chanting “No to war!” as passing cars honked their horns. Hundreds also took to the streets in St. Petersburg and dozens in Yekaterinburg. “This is the most shameful and terrible day in my life. I even was not able to go to work. My country is an aggressor. I hate Putin. What else should be done to make people open their eyes?"" Yekaterina Kuznetsova, 40-year-old engineer who joined the demonstration in St. Petersburg, told the AP. Russia's official line in the meantime remained intransigent. Speaker of the upper house of parliament, Valentina Matviyenko charged that those who spoke out against the attack were only caring about their “momentary problems.” State TV painted the attack in line with what Putin said in his televised address announcing it. Russia 1 TV host Olga Skabeyeva called it an effort “to protect people in Donbas from a Nazi regime"" and said it was “without exaggeration, a crucial junction in history.” — AP writer Kirill Zarubin contributed to this report from Korolyov, Russia.",World/Associated Press,Hundreds arrested as shocked Russians protest Ukraine attack,https://news.yahoo.com/russians-react-shock-outrage-attack-193719034.html

In the note, the children's mother wrote that her boyfriend was holding her against her will inside their home, according to Las Vegas homicide Lt. Ray Spencer. ""She stated that she didn't know where her younger child was,"" Spencer said of the note's contents, ""and that she believed he was deceased."" The teacher alerted authorities shortly after 8 a.m. Tuesday, prompting a team of Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers to begin surveilling the family's home in northeast Las Vegas. By 10 a.m., the children's mother and her boyfriend, identified in court records as Brandon Toseland, were seen leaving the house inside a vehicle. 'Come on, I have a family': Pittsburgh Uber driver begged for her life before being killed by rider, police say Nation: Florida woman facing murder charges after allegedly stabbing her husband more than 140 times Police pulled the car over in the neighborhood and detained Toseland, 35, while the woman was interviewed by officers. The woman, who has not been identified, said she had last seen her son on Dec. 11 and described to the officers months of alleged abuse by her boyfriend, Spencer said. ""She said she was not allowed to leave the house alone or go into the garage,"" according to Spencer. Shortly after the traffic stop, Toseland, who is not the father of the children, was arrested and booked into the Clark County Detention Center in downtown Las Vegas on two counts of first-degree kidnapping. Authorities are working to file a murder charge in the case. Toseland is expected to be rebooked into the detention center on Wednesday on the charge. Toseland has a history of arrests in Las Vegas dating back to at least 2005 on charges including domestic battery and disorderly conduct, court records show. In the meantime, Spencer and his team searched the home after securing a search warrant Tuesday afternoon, finding the boy's body in the freezer. The freezer was in the garage, where the woman said she was not allowed to enter. Spencer, who called the case ""such a tragic situation,"" did not release details Tuesday about how the boy may have died. The Clark County coroner's office will identify the child and determine his cause and manner of death. Toseland made his first court appearance on Wednesday. As of Tuesday evening, detectives did not consider the children's mother to be involved in the death.

2/26/2022,"By David Brunnstrom and Michael Martina WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday accused China and Russia of working together to create a new 'profoundly illiberal' world order of which Moscow's actions towards Ukraine were just a part. U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said every responsible country in the world, including China, had an obligation to urge Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down and de-escalate the Ukraine crisis. ""You will have to ask the PRC whether they have used their own considerable influence with the Russian Federation to that end,"" Price said at a regular news briefing in reference to the People's Republic of China. Referring to an upgraded ""no limits"" partnership that China and Russia announced this month in which they pledged to collaborate more against the United States and the West, Price said the direction of the development of China-Russia relations was of ""great concern."" ""We think that Russia and the PRC also want a world order,"" he said. ""But this is an order that is and would be profoundly illiberal, an order that stands in contrast to the system that countries around the world ... have built in the last seven decades. ""It is an order that is in many ways destructive, rather than additive."" Price noted that China had repeatedly in its statecraft stressed that the principal of sovereignty was inviolable and sacrosanct. ""So, you'll have to ask the PRC, how they marry that long-standing position with anything less than an effort to use the considerable influence and sway they have with the Russian Federation to urge Vladimir Putin to back down and to de-escalate,"" he said. Ukraine declared a state of emergency on Wednesday and Moscow said separatists in the east had asked for help to repel ""aggression"" as the United States stepped up efforts to deter an all-out Russian invasion by imposing fresh sanctions. China has urged all parties in the Ukraine standoff to exercise restraint and said that the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of any country should be respected and safeguarded. At the same time, it has urged the United States to respect and address Russia's demands for security guarantees. U.S.-based analysts say China is concerned about the impact Russian actions towards Ukraine could have on its trade relationship with Europe if it is considered to be supporting Russia. But they also believe Beijing's ambiguous stance and its upgraded pact with Russia have given Putin the confidence to press ahead on Ukraine. Experts told Reuters last week China would back Russia diplomatically and perhaps economically if it invades Ukraine, but would stop short of providing military support. Washington has warned Chinese firms they would face consequences if they sought to evade any export controls imposed on Moscow in the event of Russia invading Ukraine.

2/26/2022,"Few places conjure more foreboding than Chernobyl, the site of the deadly 1986 nuclear disaster. So alarm bells rang in the West when Russian forces seized the decommissioned power plant in the early hours of their invasion of Ukraine on Thursday. Why would Russia make a radioactive wasteland one of its very first targets in Ukraine? While the full answer may be known only to top officials in Moscow, the site happens to lie along one of the most direct paths to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. “The location is important because of where it sits,” retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commanding general of U.S. Army Europe, said in an interview. ""If Russian forces were attacking Kyiv from the north, Chernobyl is right there on the way, almost in the way."" Chernobyl is less than 10 miles from Ukraine's border with Belarus, a Russian ally where Moscow has been massing troops in preparation for its attack. From there, it's a relatively straight shot of about 80 miles south to Kyiv. The route from Belarus to Kyiv through Chernobyl might be particularly appealing to Russian military planners because it would allow them to cross the Dnieper River in Belarus, avoiding a potentially hazardous crossing of the major river, which bisects Ukraine, behind enemy lines. ""They want it because they want to take control of the whole effing country,"" said Evelyn Farkas, who was deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia in the Obama administration. ""They want to surround the capital."" A large ""exclusion zone"" surrounds the damaged reactor at Chernobyl and the abandoned nearby city of Pripyat, where workers have spent years painstakingly dismantling the former power plant and cleaning up radioactive debris. After the 1986 explosion, a radioactive cloud drifted across much of Europe. The radioactivity of the area around the plant has decreased in the decades since the disaster, and studies have found thriving wild animal populations in the exclusion zone, despite contamination in the soil, according to the World Nuclear Association. Recent fighting in the area this week could stir up contaminated soil and other debris, raising concerns about the possibility of harmful environmental impacts that could spread far beyond the grounds. Farkas said that even if Russian President Vladimir Putin has no interest in the decommissioned plant itself, Moscow would want to secure the facility, especially with the potential for a protracted fight with Ukrainian insurgents if Russia proceeds to occupy the country. ""They certainly don’t want loose nuclear material floating around,"" she said. ""They understand the danger there."" The Soviet Union built the Chernobyl plant when it controlled Ukraine, and many view the 1986 disaster there as a contributing factor to fall of the former superpower a few years later. The disaster has been a subject of historical revisionism in the decades since then as Putin and his allies try to recast the Soviet Union in a more positive light. After the popularity of a 2019 HBO miniseries about Chernobyl, which portrayed the disaster as a product of Soviet mismanagement, a Kremlin-backed TV network ran its own series blaming the CIA. Undamaged reactors at the plant continued producing power for Ukraine until 2000, when the plant was shut down for good. “It’s a useless piece of real estate,” said a congressional aide who has been briefed by U.S. officials. “But if you want to take Kyiv fast, you go through Chernobyl.”",World/NBC News,Why would Russia want to take Chernobyl?,https://news.yahoo.com/why-russia-want-chernobyl-220627131.html
2/26/2022,"On the afternoon of Aug. 5, 1990, President George H.W. Bush appeared at a press conference on the South Lawn of the White House. After reviewing developments related to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Bush took questions from reporters. The last elicited the most memorable words of the crisis, and perhaps of Bush's whole presidency. ""This will not stand,"" Bush insisted, ""this aggression against Kuwait."" Bush's awkward grammar and delivery made the remark an object of satire, most famously in the Coen Brothers film The Big Lebowski. It was memorable, though, less because it was funny than because Bush's words expressed a particular vision of international politics. Born in the wake of the Second World War but made plausible by the collapse of Soviet power, that vision promised an American-led world in which states would fight only in defense of recognized territorial boundaries, limiting their rivalries to economics, sports, and culture. In his address to a joint session of Congress in September, Bush would describe that vision as a ""new world order"". Others spoke of a ""new global community"", the ""end of history"", or the ""rules-based international order."" Despite the apparent success of the First Persian Gulf War, the new world order never lived up to its billing. Within just a few years, a series of wars in the former Yugoslavia demonstrated that the ghosts of Europe could not so easily be exorcised. Elsewhere in the world, ethnic, ideological, and religious clashes continued with little relief. Sept. 11 reminded us that we were not immune to those tensions. The wars of occupation that followed raised justified doubts about whether our leadership possessed the competence or wisdom to meet the grandiose standards that they set for themselves. By the 2010s, the revival of great power competition with China was conventional wisdom. And the election of Donald Trump raised serious questions about whether the American public was willing to continue paying the economic, military, and political costs of liberal hegemony. Still, the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began on this week is different to these previous crises. Rather than a distressing violation of the post-Cold War norm, it feels like a decisive end to the era that Bush proclaimed on the White House Lawn. That feeling is partly a consequence of so-called recency bias, which makes the most proximate events seem more important than temporally distant ones. But there are at least three reasons to think something fundamental has changed — with consequences we still can't foresee. First, the Russian attack is a paradigmatic case of interstate aggression, a form of warfare that was supposed to be relegated to the history books. As the very partial list above indicates, the last 30 years have not exactly been a paradise of peace. But there have been relatively few direct military clashes between internationally recognized sovereign states. Instead, much of the violence has been associated with civil wars, failed states, and non-state actors, albeit often proxies for neighbors or more distant states. In recent speeches, to be sure, Vladimir Putin has made clear that he does not regard Ukraine as a legitimate state. In that respect, the conflict might be compared to ongoing tensions over Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway region. The differences aren't only that other major powers (including the US) also don't recognize Taiwan, or that China hasn't actually attacked it. It's that Russia promised to ""respect the Independence and Sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine"" in the so-called Budapest Memorandum of 1994. Despite the impressive language they often deploy, international agreements don't really have the force of law. Still, it's significant that Russia is renouncing an explicit international commitment, notwithstanding its claim to be defending the instant ""republics"" of Donetsk and Lukhansk. Ironically, the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 is another major exception to the general decline of interstate war. In that case, though, the United States sought at least the pretense of U.N. authorization and international participation, following the script established by the First Gulf War. Russia's conduct, by contrast, is not merely aggressive but also unilateral. Even China, has so far avoided endorsing the operation in principle, even as they continue to deflect criticism and offer indirect economic support. Location also matters. Ukraine lies squarely in the zone where the worst atrocities of the 20th century were committed. Historian Timothy Snyder dubbed these environs ""Bloodlands"". Passed for decades between imperial, national, Nazi, and Soviet control, Eastern Europe presents the worst-case scenario of a world without recognized borders or effective sovereignty. (Direct memories of massacre and oppression are one of the reasons nationalist movements remain so powerful in the region). Even if it failed to take hold elsewhere, the post-Cold War settlement was designed explicitly to prevent those conditions from recurring where they had already done so much damage. That makes Russian revisionism fatal to the ""new world order"" in a way that bloody fighting in the Balkans — let alone Africa or the Middle East— was not. Most of all, though, the present situation is distinguished by American powerlessness. As my colleagues Noah Millman and Damon Linker have argued, there's just not a lot that the United States and its European allies can do, and trying too hard to ""do something"" risks exacerbating the problem. The looming, if fortunately still distant threat of nuclear war is the decisive reason. The depletion of military resources and political will after the debacles in Iraq and Afghanistan is another. Finally, high inflation raises the cost of sanctions on Russia's main export. According to recent reports, the Biden administration will not target energy, for fear of driving up already high prices at the pump and alienating European allies that rely on Russian natural gas. Liberal theorists have long argued that war is less likely between trading partners. They're right, but not with the geopolitical results they might hope. This combination of factors explains the unfamiliar, nightmarish quality of the last few days. For the first time in a generation, major world events are proceeding without even the illusion of American approval or control. When Putin announced the beginning of combat operations early on Thursday morning (Moscow time), Americans also woke up to a new world. The old order had serious flaws and blindspots, including a naive refusal to acknowledge Russian interests and vulnerabilities that is a partial cause — although not an excuse — for the present crisis. Still, I think we'll miss it now that it's gone.

2/26/2022,"By David Brunnstrom and Kanishka Singh WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday Washington is in still unresolved ""consultations"" with India, when asked if Washington and Delhi were fully in sync on a response to Russia's attack on Ukraine ahead of an expected U.N. Security Council vote. Biden did not elaborate, but his short response to a question at a briefing at which he announced tough new sanctions on Russia over Ukraine drew attention to an awkward division between his administration and India, a country central to its efforts to push back against China's growing power. India has developed close ties with Washington in recent years but has a long-standing close relationship with Moscow, which remains a major supplier of its defense equipment. The 15-member United Nations Security Council, of which India is a member, is likely to vote on Friday on a draft resolution that would condemn Russia for invading Ukraine and require Moscow to immediately and unconditionally withdraw, a senior U.S. administration official said. Russia is expected to veto the step, but Washington sees the vote as a chance to try and isolate Moscow, seeking at least 13 votes in favor and an abstention by Russia's partner - China. India has so far avoided condemning Russian actions in Ukraine, although Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did urge an end to violence there in a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden said Putin would be a pariah on the international stage as a result of his attack on Ukraine and ""any nation that countenances Russia's naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association."" Asked if India was fully in sync with the United States, he said: ""We're in consultation with India today. We haven't resolved that completely."" In a statement, the U.S. State Department said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Thursday and ""stressed the importance of a strong collective response to condemn Russia's invasion and call for an immediate withdrawal and ceasefire."" In a tweet, Jaishankar said he discussed the implications of developments in Ukraine with Blinken, without disclosing further details about the call. Jaishankar also said he had spoken to his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov and ""underlined that dialogue and diplomacy are the best way forward."" Delhi has upset Washington with its purchase of Russia's S-400 air defense system, putting it at risk of U.S. sanctions under a 2017 U.S. law aimed at deterring countries from buying Russian military hardware. In December, Russia and India signed more trade and arms deals during a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin, including one that will see India produce more than 600,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles. While there have been calls in Congress to exempt India from sanctions, some analysts say Russia's actions in Ukraine could bring increased pressure for sanctions from Russia hawks in the administration. Any sanctions could jeopardize U.S. cooperation with Delhi in the Quad forum with Japan and Australia aimed at pushing back against China's expanding influence. The White House did not immediately respond when asked to elaborate on Biden's comment and a State Department spokesperson said: ""We are continuing to consult with our Indian counterparts on a collective response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.""
