4/14/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has declined to follow Joe Biden’s example in labelling Russia’s actions in Ukraine as genocide, arguing that an “escalation of words” would not help bring peace. The French president’s remarks drew an angry response from Kyiv, particularly his apparent argument that the term “genocide” did not apply because Ukrainians and Russians were “brotherly people”. The spokesman for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, Oleh Nikolenko, called Macron’s remarks disappointing. “‘Brotherly’ people don’t kill children, don’t shoot civilians, don’t rape women, don’t mutilate the elderly, and don’t destroy the homes of other ‘brotherly’ people. Even the fiercest enemies don’t commit atrocities against defenseless people,” Nikolenko said. Biden accused Moscow of committing genocide late on Tuesday, saying. “Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian.” “And the evidence is mounting,” he said. “More evidence is coming out of the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine. And we’re going to only learn more and more about the devastation. We’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me.” The US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Michael Carpenter, made clear on Wednesday that the president’s comments did not represent an official US legal position. Carpenter said Biden had made a “clear moral determination” but added that a legal review was under way and that is “going to take some time to be completed”. Asked to comment on Biden’s accusation of genocide, Macron said that it was clear the Russian army had committed war crimes, but added: “I am prudent with terms today. “Genocide has a meaning. The Ukrainian people and Russian people are brotherly people,” he said. “It’s madness what’s happening today. It’s unbelievable brutality and a return to war in Europe. But at the same time I look at the facts, and I want to continue to try the utmost to be able to stop the war and restore peace. I’m not sure if the escalation of words serves our cause.” Another US ally, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, also stopped short of using the term “genocide” on Wednesday, though he said Putin should be “held to account” for war crimes and atrocities in Ukraine. Biden has been consistently outspoken in denouncing Russian wholesale killing of Ukrainian civilians, labelling Putin as a “war criminal” in mid-March. Multiple investigations are under way into Russian atrocities in Ukraine, which include the razing of Mariupol and the executions of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. The chief prosecutor from the international criminal court (ICC), Karim Khan visited Bucha on Wednesday and declared: “Ukraine is a crime scene” adding that there were “reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed”. The three categories of crimes under ICC jurisdiction in Ukraine are war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. A fourth crime, conducting a war of aggression, has been excluded by Khan under ICC rules as neither Ukraine nor Russia are state parties to the court. The Ukrainian government and some international lawyers have called for a special tribunal to be set up specifically to try Putin and his regime for the crime of aggression. Proving a case under the 1948 Genocide Convention requires an “intent [by the accused] to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. Biden first used the word in passing on Tuesday at a domestic policy event in Iowa about the use of ethanol in petrol. “Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide half a world away,” he said. Questioned later on whether he intended to apply the term to Russians actions in Ukraine, Biden told journalists: “Yes, I called it genocide because it’s become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian. “And the evidence is mounting,” he said. “More evidence is coming out of the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine. And we’re going to only learn more and more about the devastation. We’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me.” His comments were quickly welcomed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who applauded what he called the “true words of a true leader”. “Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil,” Zelenskiy said on Twitter. “We are grateful for US assistance provided so far and we urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities.” Before his invasion, Putin described Ukrainian separate existence as illegitimate, as he argued that Russians and Ukrainian were one people. As well as wholesale killing of civilians, Russia has been accused of the forcible transfer of captured Ukrainian civilians into Russia, including large numbers of children, while changing the rules to make it easier for Russian families to adopt them. Determining the line between crimes against humanity and genocide has sometimes proved difficult and divisive. The international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ruled that the slaughter of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica constituted genocide but not the mass killings carried out by Serb forces in other municipalities, a distinction that outraged the populations of the other devastated towns.",News/World news,Macron declines to follow Biden and call Russian acts in Ukraine ‘genocide’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/emmanuel-macron-genocide-ukraine-russia-biden

4/14/2022,"One of Britain’s most prestigious women’s cycling races is on the verge of being saved 24 hours after its longstanding sponsor pulled out in protest at British Cycling’s suspension of its transgender policy. The Women’s CiCLE classic in Melton, Leicestershire, which has been won by the Tokyo Olympic medallists Katie Archibald and Neah Evans, had looked to be an unwitting victim of British Cycling’s decision to bar the trans woman cyclist Emily Bridges racing against female riders pending a review. This move came after numerous members – and voices within the sport – raised concerns that Bridges, who broke the national junior 25-mile record as a male before transitioning, would have an unfair advantage in the female category due to retained strength and other advantages. However, others, including the main sponsor of the Women’s CiCLE race, Peter Stanton, strongly disagreed. On Tuesday he withdrew his £15,000 sponsorship in protest – leaving the women’s and junior race on the same day in June under threat. The men’s event, later this month, was unaffected. On Tuesday Sex Matters and Fair Play for Women, two groups campaigning for sex-based rights, made a formal offer to make up the cash shortfall so that all events can take place. The CiCLE Classics race director, Colin Clews, acknowledged the bid and said that he “had been overwhelmed by messages of support for women’s cycling”. He said: “We will consider all offers of sponsorship to deliver the race in 2022 and support its future development.” Dr Emma Hilton, a director of Sex Matters, said they had offered to ride to the rescue because female cyclists needed their own races for “brilliant women to race fairly and competitively”. A similar message was conveyed by Dr Nicola Williams, the director of Fair Play for Women, who said: “We believe there should be a place for everyone in sport, but fair competition for women depends on keeping it female-only.” Under British Cycling’s previous policy, trans women were allowed to compete if they reduced their testosterone levels below 5 nmol/L for a 12-month period. However, the emergence of Bridges, who began hormone therapy last year as part of her gender dysphoria treatment and raced in men’s events until February, led to a hasty rethink. Stanton said he believed that the decision was “totally unacceptable” and that by withdrawing his sponsorship he could show his support for the transgender community. “Whilst fully supportive of women’s sport, I also have many friends and colleagues within the transgender community whom I feel that I would be letting down if I did not make a stand to show my support for their rights,” he said. “This is not the first case of a transgender rider competing under UCI rules, or even as part of an official UCI team, and to arbitrarily change that position based on one individual case, I find totally unacceptable. I am desperately saddened by the Emily Bridges case and the actions that it has prompted me to take.”",Sport/Sport,Campaign groups to save women’s cycling classic hit by trans rights row,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/13/campaign-groups-to-save-womens-cycling-classic-hit-by-trans-rights-row
4/14/2022,"China’s trade with Russia jumped by more than 12% in March from a year earlier, outpacing the increase in Beijing’s trade with the rest of the world, according to Chinese customs data. Shipments to and from Russia increased 12.76% in March to $11.67bn, Chinese customs data showed on Wednesday, slowing from 25.7% growth in February, when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. The decline in trade with Russia was less severe than the decline with other countries, fuelling concerns that China has maintained strong links with Moscow despite the atrocities perpetrated by the Russian military in Ukraine. China’s growth in trade during March with the rest of the world was only 7.75%, after it increased to $505bn. Beijing has refused to call Russia’s action an invasion and has repeatedly criticised what it says are illegal western sanctions to punish Moscow. Several weeks before the attack on Ukraine, China and Russia declared a “no-limits” strategic partnership, whereby there are no forbidden areas of cooperation. Last year, total trade between China and Russia jumped 35.8% to a record $147bn. As sanctions against Russia mount, western countries fear China could offset some of its neighbour’s pain by buying more from it. Russia is a major source of oil, gas, coal and agricultural commodities for China. But analysts told Reuters they have yet to see any major indication China is violating western sanctions on Russia. A spokesperson for Chinese customs, Li Kuiwen, said China’s economic and trade cooperation with other countries including Russia and Ukraine remains normal. A group of German policy institutes said Germany could be plunged into recession if Europe’s largest economy is forced to block imports of Russian gas. German GDP would fall by 2.2% next year after a full EU embargo on Russian energy, wiping out more than 400,000 jobs, according to revised estimates of German GDP growth over the next two years. The EU last week agreed to ban coal imports from Russia from August. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is under pressure to agree tougher measures, including a ban on gas imports. Germany depends on Russia for 40% of its gas imports. The research institutes predicted that if all energy supplies from Russia were cut off instantly, growth in Europe’s largest economy would slow sharply from 2.9% last year to 1.9% this year, before shrinking in 2023. They said: “The cumulative loss of GDP in 2022 and 2023 in the event of a supply freeze is likely to be about €220bn [£180bn].” Without a ban on energy imports from Russia, the institutes said growth this year would be 2.7% compared with a previous estimate of 4.8% made last autumn. The German government said it is working to reduce that dependency, but said it needs time to exit Russian gas altogether and has opposed an immediate stop to supplies.",News/World news,China’s trade with Russia up by 12% in March from a year earlier,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/chinas-trade-with-russia-up-by-12-in-march-from-a-year-earlier
4/14/2022,"Teachers in England say they need more time, training and resources to tackle the dangers of pornography in schools, against a backdrop of increasing incidents of pupils taking and sharing sexual images. Delegates to the National Education Union’s annual conference heard that secondary schools were only able to allocate a few hours a year to teach the relationships and sex education (RSE) curriculum in England, giving them little time to discuss issues such as pornography and sexual abuse as they arose. Jon Reddiford, a teacher from north Somerset, told the conference that he had recently experienced “a really horrible set of incidents” at his school involving year 11 pupils that could have been avoided with more RSE teaching in previous years. “It had been going on for a long time before it emerged to staff that a number of the girls were taking explicit photos of themselves and sending them to their boyfriends, which were then being shared around. It later emerged that pressure was being put on the girls by their boyfriends to do this,” Reddiford said. “It needed for the bigger picture to be tackled. The fact that these kind of images were easily available to 15- and 16-year-olds, and the fact that there wasn’t the space in school to discuss them in a way that was appropriate for teenagers … made it much harder for us to deal with it.” Reddiford said it was important for the union to take a stand, “because the impact it had on our year 11s was absolutely massive and we could have dealt with it much better at the time”. The delegates in Bournemouth unanimously passed a motion calling for “properly resourced, high-quality” relationship and sex education in schools and colleges, as well as consistent recording and reporting of sexual harassment, abuse and violence online and off-line. Amy Fletcher, a teacher from Tower Hamlets who moved the motion, said: “We must acknowledge that young people will feel curious about sex, and they may look to pornography if they do not get excellent RSE in schools.” Sarah Byrne, a delegate from Hackney, noted that the NSPCC had found that one in 20 pupils of primary school age had shared nude images with each other. Byrne said staff were expected to teach the current curriculum “with zero training including, crucially, the requirement to address pornography. In my school it would be one hour per fortnight … How are we supposed to promote healthy relations and safeguard our young people in this context, with no time and no training?” Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said that young children could be accidentally exposed to porn “because of algorithms” used by social media, with many lacking the maturity to understand or cope. “Relationships and sex education needs to have enough time in the school curriculum to empower young people around the key areas of consent, self-worth and respect, because levels of sexual harassment in schools and across society are deeply entrenched and cause real harm and abuse,” Bousted said.",News/Education,"Schools in England need more resources to address dangers of porn, teachers say",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/13/schools-in-england-need-more-resources-to-address-dangers-of-porn-teachers-say
4/14/2022,"I’ve followed British politics since I was first able to vote in 1990. At that time, I was a student, full of fiery idealism but understanding of the need to accept and engage with a spectrum of opinions – the hallmark of a healthy, pluralistic democracy. Sure, my picks at the ballot box didn’t always win, and there were scandals, and politicians made mistakes or behaved dishonourably. But despite all that, it still felt like a system worth defending, worth believing in, worth promoting even. More than three decades later, and after a truly torrid period that has exposed a deep rot at the heart of power, I feel nothing but resignation, despair and a nihilistic desire to disengage permanently. What point is there in any of this if those making the laws break those laws or find ways around them and yet still cling to power (Boris Johnson defies calls to quit after he and Rishi Sunak fined, 12 April)? Worse still, they – and their supporters – seek to hide behind the smokescreen of war and humanitarian tragedy elsewhere to avoid doing the honourable thing. Ensuring that those who lie, break laws or seek to act with impunity do not retain power, and are forced to endure a true reckoning, is a sign that the democratic values we purport to believe in do matter. It’s a sign that we, as participants in and custodians of our democracy, care enough to preserve its integrity. That is what sends a message to the Vladimir Putins of this world. If some in this country can’t see that, we have already lost.Colin MontgomeryEdinburgh  It is striking to note the spurious argument that because there is war in Ukraine this means that the prime minister should not be replaced. History shows that on numerous occasions we have replaced the prime minister in wars that we have been directly involved in. For instance, in May 1940, Neville Chamberlain resigned after the failure of British efforts to liberate Norway. In December 1916, at the height of the first world war, Lloyd George replaced Herbert Asquith. More recently, Margaret Thatcher resigned in November 1990, with Iraq invading Kuwait in August of that year, which led to the Gulf war. Add to this, changes to prime ministers during the war in Afghanistan, the second Boer war, the second Opium war and the Crimean war, and it’s clear that this is not unprecedented in a time of conflict. Those who make the law cannot be seen to be breaking the law and it is scarcely credible that Boris Johnson, who has now lost the final fragments of any moral authority he did have, can carry the confidence of the country and remain in office.Alex OrrEdinburgh  As your editorial states: “The integrity of British government is now in the hands of Conservative MPs” (12 April). Could one of those MPs kindly explain how, at a time of international tension, it reassures our allies and intimidates potential enemies for this country to continue to be led by a politician universally acknowledged as a serial liar and who does not keep promises or adhere to legally binding agreements?Nigel MorrisHorncastle, Lincolnshire  I have great sympathy with Tory MPs.

4/14/2022,"Re Adrian Chiles’s column (Does your job take a toll on your body? You’re in trouble unless you’re an athlete, 6 April), building workers both deserve, and need, the kind of physical healthcare that athletes get. During building work for the 2012 London Olympics, contractors were encouraged to run warm-up and stretching sessions to protect workers from injury – and many did. We provided, through Park Health, a comprehensive health programme for thousands of builders that included physiotherapy for those who suffered injury from work, or during football at the weekend. There remains a huge gap between workers’ needs and the scope and funding of the NHS for prevention; occupational health is a key example of this failure to prevent ill health rather than treat afterwards.
