4/14/2022,"A Russian tank is filmed firing on apartments in Mariupol; evidence emerges that a cluster bomb was used to strike against the train station in Kramatorsk and concerns surface about the possible use of phosphorus in Ukraine’s cities. Moscow’s forces have been repeatedly accused of using indiscriminate weapons in cities throughout the seven-week-long Ukraine war, a disregard for civilian life that has already almost certainly led to thousands of unnecessary deaths. A preliminary war crimes assessment, conducted on behalf of 45 members of the OSCE, concluded that Russia had engaged in “a clear pattern” of war crimes, targeting, for example, hospitals, schools and places of shelter during the seven weeks of fighting. Had Russian forces avoided such tactics “the number of civilians killed or injured would have remained much lower,” the OSCE monitors observed. At its simplest level, Russia is accused of using unguided bombs – heavy artillery, Grad multiple rockets, air dropped bombs – on urban areas by the OSCE monitors. “A majority of Russian attacks in populated areas have been conducted with unguided artillery,” was their grim conclusion in a 99-page report. It is a war crime to target civilians directly, and to engage in an attack on a military target that is expected to cause a loss of civilian life excessive in relation to the battlefield gain – regardless of the weapons used. Film shot by the Associated Press in Mariupol last month, for instance, shows a Russian tank shooting at an apartment block from some distance. In that city, scene of the worst urban fighting in the war so far, the office of the UN’s human rights commissioner has already concluded “126 multi-story residential buildings were damaged and 65 were destroyed”. That includes a maternity hospital in the southern city and its theatre, where it is estimated that 300 died following an air strike on a site where trapped civilians were trying to shelter from the fighting. Certain weapons are also considered particularly egregious and in some cases are banned by treaty. Cluster munitions, which indiscriminately scatter small bombs over a wide area, are banned by more than 100 states, although neither Russia nor Ukraine (or the US) have signed up to a treaty first introduced in 2008. Evidence gathered by the BBC strongly suggests that the Tochka-U missile which struck Kramatorsk railway station earlier this month, killing 50, was a cluster munition. Eye-witnesses reported hearing multiple explosions, and the broadcaster’s site investigation revealed a scattered pattern of smaller bomb damage nearby. Over the weekend, the mayor of Kharkiv reported that Russian forces were dropping a new type of bomb on the city “by parachute”. Ukraine’s Centre for Defence Strategies said the shells contained cluster bombs, some of which had thermal homing, but most simply scattered around causing damage in the local area. These are far from isolated episodes. The OSCE monitors said they had received reports of 134 incidents of alleged cluster munition use; multiple uses were recorded by Human Rights Watch, an NGO, in the southern city of Mykolaiv, including an attack on 13 March that killed nine civilians waiting in line for a cash machine. Concerns too circulate about an escalation of the conflict through the use of other banned weapons – but this is less certain. Britain’s Ministry of Defence is still investigating a report from earlier this week that chemical weapons – “a white smoke” – were used by Russia in Mariupol affecting three people. Victims said they suffered from tinnitus, tachycardia (a fast heartbeat), inflamed eyes and problems with balance, before gradually recovering. But experts were not immediately convinced and the reports are unlikely to be verified because it is not possible for third party chemical weapons investigators to reach the besieged city. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also warned in an address to the Estonian parliament on Wednesday that Russia was also using “phosphorus bombs” although there was no immediate evidence to back up the claim. Britain, too, warned earlier this week that phosphorus could be used to break resistance in Mariupol. White phosphorus is used by militaries as a smokescreen or to illuminate targets at night, but is highly dangerous if it used against people. Like napalm, it causes extreme burns if it touches skin and is almost impossible to put out; it dissolves in body fat and can cause serious internal damage to the heart, liver and kidneys. In any event, it is already the tragic case that the indiscriminate use of weaponry, largely by Russia, in the war in Ukraine has caused excessive civilian harm. Iain Overton, the director of the NGO Action on Armed Violence, said: “Years of research show that when explosive weapons are used in towns and cities, nearly 90% of the victims are civilians. “But in the case of Ukraine it may be significantly higher than that, closer to 97%, because of the scale of the shelling and air strikes in towns and cities. We do not yet know how many civilians died during the bombing of Mariupol – it may be 10,000 or more.”",News/World news,"As Russia continues to bomb Ukraine, are its weapons of choice getting worse?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/as-russia-continues-to-bomb-ukraine-are-its-weapons-of-choice-getting-worse
4/14/2022,"The Liberal party’s candidate in Warringah, Katherine Deves, compared her anti-trans activism to standing up against the Holocaust during a YouTube panel. She also expressed support for One Nation New South Wales state MP Mark Latham’s bill to ban teachers discussing gender identity in schools in the same video. Appearing alongside British television writer and anti-trans activist Graham Linehan last year, Deves appeared to compare her campaign to prevent transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports to Germans speaking out against the transportation of Jewish people to death camps in the second world war. “I’ve always loved 20th-century history and I think many people would say to themselves, ‘Oh, I’d never be the villagers that stayed quiet while the trains went past, or whatever, I would have been part of the French resistance, the underground, you know, I would have been one of those people’,” she said in the video. “And when all of this was happening and no one was sort of speaking out I thought, ‘God, this is … the moment in my life where I am going to have to stand up and say something against the status quo and against the establishment and say I don’t think this is right.’ And it might come at a cost to me but I have to say it.” The comments were criticised by the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies chief executive, Darren Bark, and the Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive, Peter Wertheim. “There is nothing in contemporary Australian life and politics that is remotely comparable to the wholesale destruction of human life and civilisation that occurred during world war two,” they said in a joint statement. “This sort of hyperbole trivialises the depths of inhumanity that were plumbed during that terrible conflict, and desensitises people to evil, instead of educating them to recognise and counteract it. “There should always be extra caution taken when making historical analogies, especially by those who aspire to hold public office or leadership positions in our community.” Deves, a “captain’s pick” by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to run against the independent MP, Zali Steggall, in Tony Abbott’s former seat of Warringah, has come under fire in recent days over a series of since-deleted posts made on social media. On Wednesday the Guardian revealed Deves described Wear it Purple Day – which is billed as an event celebrating diversity – as a “grooming tactic” promoting “extreme body modification” on her now-deleted website. She also repeatedly misgendered a New Zealand trans athlete, Laurel Hubbard, and suggested a young boy could ask to “remove his penis” after attending a respectful relationships workshop at school. It came after News.com.au reported Deves had also deleted social media accounts on which she described trans children as “surgically mutilated and sterilised” and said she was “triggered” by the LGBTQ+ rainbow flag. Deves has since apologised for some of her posts, saying that her comments were “not acceptable”. “My advocacy for the rights and safety of women and girls is well known, and I stand by my desire to ensure we protect the safety of women and girls and our entire community,” she said in a statement. “However, the language I used was not acceptable, and for that I apologise.” But the comments made in the video – which was recorded in February last year – are likely to increase the pressure on Morrison to disendorse Deves, who was nominated to run in the seat after the federal takeover of the NSW party despite having little factional support. While the party always considered it highly unlikely that it would win back Warringah from Steggall, the Guardian understands Liberal moderates fighting tough campaigns against independent candidates in the nearby seats of North Sydney and Wentworth have become increasingly frustrated with the slew of headlines about Deves’s position on trans rights. On Wednesday Morrison was forced to backpedal after earlier flagging the Coalition might support a bill banning transgender women from playing women’s sport after a backlash from Liberal moderates. Deves appeared on Linehan’s podcast along with University of Melbourne academic Holly Lawford-Smith, who has faced backlash from colleagues over her position on trans issues. After she set up a website encouraging women to report instances where they felt threatened by transgender women, colleagues penned an open letter saying the site “conflicts with the faculty commitment to diversity and inclusion”. Linehan, the creator of British television series Father Ted, was suspended from Twitter in 2020 for “repeated violations” of the site’s rules over hateful conduct and platform manipulation. He has also been previously accused of comparing trans activism to nazism. During the video, Deves also railed against Victoria’s ban on gay conversion practices, as the bill outlaws practices that seek to change or suppress a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. She said provisions in the law giving the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission the power to investigate and refer reports of conversion practices to the police amounted to the creation of a “star chamber”. Deves also said the bill put forward by Latham – which proposed banning trans students from playing high school sports aligning with their gender and requiring parental consent before any discussion of matters concerning gender or sexuality – was the “biggest issue” in the state. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The NSW Coalition government recently said it would not support the bill because it “may lead to targeted discrimination against a marginalised community, which already experiences poorer mental health and wellbeing outcomes”. In a submission on the bill, Deves’s group, Save Women’s Sport Australasia, argued the discussion of “gender identity” in schools was “deeply concerning”. “This is deeply concerning due to the highly contentious nature of the topic, and it is arguing that NSW schoolchildren should be taught factually untrue and ideological concepts such as human beings can ‘change sex’, or ‘boys can be girls, or have periods’ and some ‘girls have penises’,” the submission stated.

4/14/2022,"Operations are being cancelled across England as Covid causes “major disruption” inside the NHS, the country’s top surgeon has said, as doctors and health leaders say the government’s backlog targets look increasingly unachievable. Six million people are on the waiting list for NHS hospital care, including more than 23,000 who have waited more than two years. The NHS in England is due to publish its latest waiting times data on Thursday. Boris Johnson said in February that he had launched “the biggest catch-up programme in the history of the health service”, but in the same month he dropped every domestic Covid restriction. Now record-high Covid rates are wreaking havoc with the ability of the NHS to catch up with surgery that was delayed or cancelled before and during the pandemic. More than 28,000 staff are off work every day due to Covid, recent figures show, while more than 20,000 patients are in hospital with Covid, which has dramatically reduced the number of beds and space available for planned surgery patients. “Unfortunately, Covid-19 continues to cause major disruption in the NHS, with high staff absences in recent weeks,” Prof Neil Mortensen, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, told the Guardian. “We have heard that planned surgery is being cancelled again in different parts of the country due to staff being off sick with the virus. This is understandably frustrating for surgical teams who want to help their patients by getting planned surgery up and running again. It’s also very distressing for patients who need a planned operation.” Ministers promised to eliminate all waits of more than two years by July this year, all 18-month waits by 2023, and all one-year waits by March 2025, but NHS staff say Covid is already derailing their efforts to meet those promises. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said pressure was “piling up” on the NHS across England from “a triple Covid-related whammy” of staff absences, high numbers of people in hospital with Covid and delays in discharging patients as Covid hits social care services. “This means that the NHS hasn’t been able consistently to hit top speed on backlog recovery, as we were hoping to, coming out of winter,” he said. “Some trusts are now processing more elective cases than they were before Covid hit, with some running at 105% to 108% of pre-Covid activity. But others, with higher Covid impacts, are some way behind that. This will impact on the NHS’s ability to meet the targets we agreed.” The British Medical Association accused the government of failing to grasp how serious a threat Covid poses to the NHS, the backlog targets and to wider society. It said that unless ministers brought in measures to bring down infection rates, such as masks on public transport and in confined spaces, and ventilation and air filtration in public and work settings, pressures on the NHS would escalate further, staff absence rates would rise further and millions of patients would wait longer for treatment. A survey of its members found 87% of doctors said the government’s pledges to reduce the waiting lists for elective care using the existing workforce were mostly or entirely unachievable. “The government is burying its head in the sand to the immediate threat of the virus to our healthcare services,” said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA’s chair of council. “It is clear that the result of the government’s ‘living with Covid’ strategy is failing to allow us to live with Covid.” One hospital chief executive told the Guardian that ministers’ targets were “incredibly challenging”. A second said: “These targets are not realistic at all because of staff shortages, which existed before Covid and are being compounded by the number of people still reporting sick, and also staff burnout.” Meanwhile, a data analysis by the Press Association published on Thursday revealed that dozens of patients have been waiting for more than three years. At least nine have been on the NHS waiting list for more than four years. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the whole healthcare system, said the ongoing impact of Covid was now interfering with the ability of the NHS to tackle the backlog, and there should be “a healthy dose of realism” about what staff could achieve. NHS England said staff “continue to pull out all the stops” to tackle the backlog, and were also “adopting creative innovations” to ensure patients get the care they need.",News/Society,Covid disruption to NHS in England wreaks havoc with surgery backlog,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/14/covid-disruption-to-nhs-in-england-wreaks-havoc-with-surgery-backlog
4/14/2022,"Over the past two weeks, more than four years after its first hearing, the Grenfell Tower inquiry finally heard from senior government figures responsible for housing and building regulations in the years before the disaster. Eric Pickles, the secretary of state for housing under David Cameron from 2010 to 2015, made the headlines for telling the inquiry to use its time “wisely” as he had an “extremely busy day”. He also managed to offend survivors and the bereaved by getting the number of victims wrong during his closing statement, in which he also concluded that changing his actions as minister “wouldn’t have made any difference whatsoever”. Stephen Williams, a Liberal Democrat junior minister with responsibility for building regulations from October 2013, said there was not “anything I could have done to materially make a difference to what happened in July 2017”. The fire took place in June. It seems that a moment of self-reflection – or even an accurate account of the tragedy – was too much to ask for from our most senior elected representatives. They insist they are not responsible for decisions leading up to the fire. However, over its investigation, the inquiry has consistently painted a damning picture of the deregulation drive that was a key focus during Cameron’s time as prime minister. The obsession with abolishing red tape saw ministers at that time ignoring warning signs about a growing building safety crisis, and civil servants too disaffected to speak up. The state failure to prepare for tower block fires goes back decades. Fires in Merseyside and Scotland in the 1990s provided stark warnings, and unpublished tests commissioned under New Labour showed how poorly the cladding used on Grenfell performed in a fire. However, perhaps the most crucial moment in the narrative being pieced together by the inquiry is the Lakanal House fire in 2009, in Camberwell, south London, which killed six people. This should have been a turning point for setting out clear and comprehensive regulations. In 2013, the coroner investigating the fire made a number of recommendations to the government. Ministers were advised to review a document called Approved Document B, which provides guidance on the fire safety part of the building regulations. Pickles, the housing secretary at the time, agreed to a review, but set a deadline of 2016-17. In reality, the review had barely started by the date of the Grenfell fire in 2017. This delay proved fateful. Since Grenfell, ministers have insisted that the building regulations did not allow for combustible cladding to be installed on high-rise buildings, shifting the blame to industry. However, confusion over Approved Document B led many in industry to believe this type of cladding was permitted. More than 480 high rises in England have now been found to contain the same type of cladding as Grenfell Tower, while many more contain other dangerous claddings. One stark example includes an email sent from a cladding manufacturer to the civil servant responsible for Approved Document B, that warned “confusion and misunderstanding” over the building regulations was leading to a situation of “grave concern” and called for clearer guidance to be issued. Meanwhile, successive ministers between 2014 and 2017 were sent more than 21 letters from a group of MPs, led by the late David Amess, that warned a review of the guidance must be carried out urgently before another deadly fire occurs. Given these warnings, the government still dragged its feet on reviewing Approved Document B. The civil servants with responsibility for the building regulations certainly have a lot to answer for. Much more should have been done to raise the alarm. However, the failures of officials must be understood within the context of the deregulation agenda of the time. In January 2012, Cameron announced that his “new year resolution” was to “kill off the health and safety culture for good”. “We need to realise, collectively, that we cannot eliminate risk and that some accidents are inevitable,” he wrote in the Evening Standard in April of that year. He tasked the civil service with a “one in, one out” rule for departments wishing to introduce new regulations. This was toughened to “one in, two out” in January 2013 and “one in, three out” in 2016. Multiple officials told the inquiry last month that this policy made their job extremely difficult. One senior civil servant related the “anxiety and frustration of not being able to actually move things forward”, and noted that ministers made it “very clear” that items like the Approved Document B fire guidance were part of the desired cuts. The politicians interviewed over the past two weeks have disputed these claims. Ministers have insisted that fire safety rules were exempt from the deregulation drive, with Pickles saying the idea that Approved Document B was included in the “one in, one out” policy was “ludicrous”. Any mistakes made in the years leading up to Grenfell were blamed mainly on the civil service. In his witness statement to the inquiry, James Wharton, the junior minister who was responsible for building regulations between May 2015 and July 2016, said: “Everything happens slowly in the civil service.” Pickles raised concerns about the “line management” of the junior civil servants who received the warnings about the building regulations. The lead counsel for the inquiry, Richard Millett QC, likes to ask if there is anything witnesses wish they had done differently. In the past, this question has provoked tears and outpourings of regret from the architects, contractors, officials and firefighters who have been called to give evidence. But there was no such reflection by these ministers. They don’t appear interested in examining whether their overwhelming drive for deregulation contributed to an environment where important reviews into matters affecting life safety were kicked into the long grass. Not even the death of 72 people was enough to make these politicians realise that, by minimising the state’s role in regulating businesses, their government failed in its most basic of tasks: keeping people safe.

4/14/2022,"The world premiere of a musical about the “young, sexy, radical” early life of Nelson Mandela is coming to the Young Vic in London this autumn as the flagship production of a season that examines the theme of revolution, protest and its consequences. The Young Vic’s artistic director, Kwame Kwei-Armah, said the Mandela musical was not a “romantic rendition” of the political leader’s life but instead focused on the lead up to his imprisonment on Robben Island, where he spent most of his 27-year term as a political prisoner, and the impact it had on his family, and in particular his second wife, Winnie. Kwei-Armah said: “Revolution isn’t cheap, it is really expensive on the soul, and I think for a generation who have grown up with activism at their core this is a really interesting reminder of the costs, and what we need to do to create a better world.” Written by Laiona Michelle, who penned Little Girl Blue, a musical about the life of Nina Simone, and with songs from South African composers Shaun and Greg Dean Borowsky, Mandela was produced with the approval and collaboration of the political leader’s family and has been in the works for seven years. His granddaughter Nandi Mandela said she hoped her grandfather’s story, “of a man from humble beginnings who pulled himself up by his bootstraps”, would resonate with audiences; while his great-grandson Luvuyo Madasa said he wanted people to see him “in a new light and recognise he was just a human being following his path”. Kwei-Armah said the production came at a time when Mandela’s legacy was being debated in South Africa, with younger South Africans being split between seeing him as a “hero or somebody who let them down”. “It’s interesting because that theme runs right across the world right now. We can look at gen Z’s view of millennials,” he said. Originally announced in 2019 as a forthcoming Broadway production, Mandela is now part of a new summer and autumn season at the Young Vic that Kwei-Armah hopes will give a younger generation, who have grown up with climate protests and the Black Lives Matter movement, an understanding of the price radicals have paid in the past. “I’ve watched my children or young people they are now born into radicalism in a way that my generation was steered away from radicalism,” he said. “I think it’s important to not just see the headlines of what it is to be radical, but the cost to Mandela’s family, the cost to his relationship, the cost to his mental health.” Other productions in the Young Vic season include an adaptation of Édouard Louis’ Who Killed My Father, which was described as “a bludgeoning critique of France’s treatment of its working class”. The acclaimed director Ivo van Hove will take charge, with the Dutch actor Hans Kesting performing the piece as a monologue. Kwei-Armah said the play would have renewed relevance after the French election where many of the issues discussed in the work, such as workers’ rights, treatment of the working class and snobbery, were driving an election in which the French political map appears to be completely redrawn. Kwei-Armah said: “We’ve seen the rise of Trumpian America to Brexit Britain to a radicalised France. We’ve seen the effects I think of the last 10 years of economic rebellion.” Chasing Hares, a new play from the award-winning playwright Sonali Bhattacharyya, will debut at the Young Vic and concerns the impact of globalisation as the play moves between West Bengal and the UK, while “satirical camp-comedy-horror” the Secretaries also features. Since reopening fully after pandemic restrictions were lifted, Kwei-Armah has directed the Collaboration, which starred Paul Bettany as Andy Warhol and Jeremy Pope as Jean-Michel Basquiat, with a version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic musical Oklahoma! set to open at the Young Vic from the end of April.

4/14/2022,"Turkish public prosecutors have sparked outrage among feminists by demanding the closure of the country’s largest women’s rights group accusing it of being “against morality”. We Will Stop Femicide (WWSF) has been issued with a letter demanding the group is dissolved on public security grounds and organisers now face a lengthy court battle to stay open. The prosecutors claim the group broke the law and acted with immorality by “disintegrating the family structure by ignoring the concept of the family under the guise of defending women’s rights”. Fidan Ataselim, general secretary of WWSF, said: “We don’t see this as just an attack on us. For us, this is an attack on all women in Turkey, on all social movements, on the entire democratic public opinion.” It was a grotesque action, said Emma Sinclair-Webb, Turkey director of Human Rights Watch. “It’s very provocative,” she said. “The authorities know perfectly well that this is a highly successful and very visible campaign. “It’s grotesque to go after this group, it’s completely disproportionate – and what are you going after? Everyone knows it’s ridiculous.” It is the latest salvo against civil society, already riled by president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s decision to withdraw Turkey from the Istanbul convention on violence against women last year. The move sparked large protests, many organised by WWSF, which brought a harsh police response. Erdoğan and his Justice and Development party (AKP) have defended the decision, saying existing laws are enough to protect women. The move to shutter WWSF is regarded as an effort to marginalise feminist campaigners and divide them from more conservative women seen as more sympathetic to the government. A general election is expected this year, and Erdoğan faces growing opposition at the polls. “They withdrew from the Istanbul convention, and society reacted very strongly. Now they are trying to polarise society. They are trying to marginalise our movement but they won’t be able to do it, because we are an organisation that draws its power from society,” said Ataselim. “Ultimately, this is a divisive act intended to pit women against each other,” said Webb. “It’s sowing further social division going forth as a way to go into an election cycle as well – Erdoğan is pitting women against women in an attempt to shore up support of religious, pious, conservative women against these women who they can say are immoral,” she said. “They’re trying to make a culture war out of this.” WWSF, with 750 active members, was founded in 2010 in response to the murder of a 17-year-old student by her partner. It has a nationwide network providing legal support to survivors of domestic violence, as well as collecting data on femicide, monitoring trials and organising rallies. It comes amid a rise in femicides in Turkey. WWSF estimates that 416 women were killed because of their gender last year, and a further 72 murdered from January to March 2022. Şükran Eroğlu, from the Istanbul Bar Association’s women’s rights centre, said she had anticipated the authorities’ attack on WWSF after changes to the law earlier this year limiting freedom of association. “We knew that this would have consequences,” she said. “So this would definitely start with women’s associations, because the women’s movement is on the rise in Turkey.” Gülsüm Kav, who founded WWSF, vowed to fight the closure. “This is an attack on women’s right to life. So we will never give up our rights, our struggle. We will fight together with the public so that this unlawful step can be reversed,” she said.

4/14/2022,"Nicholas Britell is the composer of the definitive TV theme tune of the 21st century. The New Yorker’s dizzyingly hypnotic title music to HBO’s splenetic family saga Succession has been described as sounding like “a smashed music box”. When Britell first played it to Jesse Armstrong, the showrunner of the hit TV series greeted it with the words: “Fuck, yeah!” Yet there’s one thing that annoys softly spoken Britell: the “Skip intro” facility on streaming services, which was brought in five years ago and lets viewers bypass a show’s opening credits. “I am very against it,” says Britell. “TV theme music is incredibly important. It’s almost a show’s DNA identifier. It serves as an overture to bring you in and sets the tone. I think that formal entrée is crucial.” Robust words from the man whose Emmy-winning, earwormy Succession work, with its gothic strings, cascading piano and skittering beats, is helping to revive TV theme tunes. Britell collaborates regularly with film-makers Barry Jenkins (who wrote the Oscar-nominated scores for both Moonlight and If Beale Street Could Talk) and Adam McKay (who scored The Big Short, Vice and Don’t Look Up). But it’s TV music that he’s been “obsessive about since I was a kid”. As well as Succession, he scored last year’s acclaimed Amazon adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad. “Every show deserves its own sonic universe,” says Britell. “A soundscape that’s unique and special.” So why was “Skip intro” invented? We can blame Netflix and data metrics. According to Cameron Johnson, Netflix’s director of product innovation, users were fast-forwarding through the first five minutes of an episode 15% of the time. This suggested that many viewers wanted to whiz past the title sequence. If you’re binge-watching, after all, intros can become repetitive. Johnson himself admits that he often tried to manually spool through the Game of Thrones titles, but got frustrated when he stopped short or went too far. So, in early 2017, his team consumer-tested a range of names: “Jump past credits”, “Jump ahead”, “Skip credits”, “Skip intro” and simply “Skip”. Users had a clear favourite and “Skip intro” was born, with most rival streaming services following. Where does this leave theme tune composers? Have they grown to hate the little button that, according to Johnson, brings “a little moment of delight to audiences around the world”? Murray Gold was Doctor Who’s musical director for more than a decade and is a longtime collaborator with writer Russell T Davies, scoring hit series including Queer As Folk and It’s a Sin. He’s none too keen on the button. “It really bugs me because, a lot of the time, people’s default setting is to skip past the titles,” says Gold. “When we watch the American Office at home, I won’t ever let my wife skip. The opening titles are so short and I just want to hear the music.” Grammy-winner David Arnold scored five James Bond films but also has an illustrious TV CV, having composed the theme tunes for Little Britain, Sherlock, Dracula and Good Omens. He insists that they are a vital part of the viewing experience. “Take The Sopranos,” says Arnold. “You’ve got that amazing Alabama 3 song Woke Up This Morning, which sets it up completely. I never fast-forward because I’m always happy to hear that tune. It’s the same with Succession. Great theme tunes make you feel anchored in the show’s world. That’s what I try to do with mine: welcome you and prepare you for what’s about to happen. It’s like having the lighting and the heating right in your house when you come home.” Arnold believes intro-skippers are missing out. “A title sequence is as essential a part of the show as any other,” he says. “If you think it isn’t, you’re not watching in the way that you’re meant to. Information is being imparted. It’s like a kid snuggling down to read a book. On Listen With Mother, they’d always say, ‘Are you sitting comfortably? Then I’ll begin.’ That’s what a title sequence does – settles you down and guides you in. It gets you excited, your mind opens and you’re away. If you decide to skip that stage, the experience won’t be as satisfying.” Canadian-British composer Carly Paradis is responsible for Line of Duty, Sick Note, The Pembrokeshire Murders and Sky’s new supernatural thriller The Rising. She has mixed feelings but concedes that skipping can be soul-destroying for composers. “I’m guilty of using it myself, so I can’t complain too much,” she says. “But when you pour your heart, time, sweat and tears into a piece of music and get incredible musicians on it, it is a little heartbreaking. I’m glad I started out in the pre-skip era.” However, it is not just “Skip intro” that is dealing a blow to TV theme tunes. Many dramas are doing away with theme music and title sequences altogether, instead deploying a “cold open” in a bid to seize viewers’ attention immediately. The likes of Peaky Blinders, Fleabag, Girls, I May Destroy You and Killing Eve plunge straight in, before a title card flashes up as a reminder of which show you’re watching. Even then, it’s often just a brief flash of a logo or bold typeface. “Big theme tunes definitely went out of fashion for a while in the 2010s,” says Gold. “The trend was to go straight to picture. You tend to find cold opens in shows that want to emphasise their closeness to reality – either vérité-style dramas or things that are almost too important to have something as artificial as a piece of music to introduce them.” Arnold has another example. “With shows like Better Call Saul, you have a little signature twang sound at the start. It’s barely a theme tune, more of a punchline. It starts something, then it gets choked, and that says something about the character. It does the same job, just in a different way.” Still, after a spell in the doldrums, “proper” theme tunes seem to be slowly making a comeback – partly because of the success of Succession. “Nick Britell brought back that old-fashioned musical approach and everyone responded positively,” says Arnold. “It’s such a brilliant piece, conceptually and musically. It has its roots in classical but it’s got hip-hop beats and some ugly distorted stuff. People will always respond to a good tune.” Gold also detects a change. “Streamers seem to be bringing theme tunes back a bit,” he says. “I think it’s because they don’t need to keep you on the channel like a terrestrial network does. When we’re in a world of drama, and especially entertainment, you really want to bring the cast on with an old-fashioned song, don’t you? There’s definitely a taste for it again. It goes in cycles.” Gold points out that, whatever else is going on, the sheer volume of programmes in today’s TV landscape means more work for composers. “We’re now producing content at a gigantic rate,” he says. “There’s never been this much drama. Although the delivery method is changing, streamers are keeping to a high artistic standard because that’s what gets eyeballs. Producers expect high-quality, interesting music and are reaching out to young up-and-coming composers. That’s encouraging.” Unsurprisingly, the squeezing of closing credits vexes composers too, with follow-on episodes being flagged and counted down almost immediately. “I’m very against being pulled away from the end credits,” says Britell. “End credits give you a moment of reverie to sit and think back on what you’ve just seen.” Gold agrees: “Streamers tend to serve up the next episode five seconds into the end credits. You never get to hear the closing music in full. I’d rather the default setting wasn’t to interrupt the credits. Besides – everyone wants to see their name.” Netflix says the “Skip intro” button is now pressed 136m times a day, saving users worldwide a cumulative 130 years or so of viewing time. While this sounds like a good thing, in the bid to save precious seconds, are we losing part of the fabric of our pop culture? To save the TV theme tune, should we resist hitting that button? “We end up getting the world we deserve,” says Gold, while Arnold compares it to CDs replacing vinyl: “Albums were assembled carefully, with songs designed to be listened to in a certain order. As soon as CDs turned up, people would just skip to their favourite songs. I’m not sure ‘Skip intro’ delivers the experience the makers were hoping for. You’re editing it to your own tastes. Why not let us mute a character we don’t like as well? If you give people the tools to do that sort of thing, we shouldn’t be surprised when they use them.” Arnold has just finished working on a drama for the BBC and Netflix. Called Inside Man, the show is written by Steven Moffatt and stars David Tennant. “It’s a dark, twisted, logic-defying, cerebral conundrum of a show,” says Arnold. “And the music reflects that. Next, I start work on the second series of Good Omens.” Presumably both theme tunes are too good to be skipped? He laughs and says: “Let’s hope so.” Murray Gold“Ramin Djawadi’s themes for Westworld and Game of Thrones are both fantastic. Toast of London puts me in a happy mood. Sex and the City is underrated too – musically complicated yet so witty and minimal. I always want to hear every second of The Simpsons. And with The Royle Family, the pathos of the music completes the journey of each episode. You need the closure of those final resolving chords.” Carly Paradis“The X-Files theme by Mark Snow influenced how I approached tension and suspense in Line of Duty. Great ones from when I was a kid include Miami Vice, The A-Team, Murder She Wrote, Knight Rider and The Twilight Zone. More recent favourites are Stranger Things, Succession, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Downton Abbey and Peaky Blinders.” David Arnold“I grew up in the 60s and 70s when every TV theme tune was a classic: Dad’s Army, Are You Being Served?, The Protectors, Van Der Valk, The Sweeney, Z Cars, This Is Your Life, even Crossroads. You can whistle all of them. More recently, I loved Succession and Devs. That’s an incredible piece of work.”",Arts/Television & radio,‘I don’t let my wife use it’ – great TV theme tune composers savage ‘skip intro’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/14/netflix-skip-intro-succession-great-tv-theme-tune-composers-nicholas-britell
4/14/2022,"Set against the lapping waters of the western Mediterranean, the mounds of half-chewed apples, takeout containers and dirty nappies began accumulating in January. Fed by a continuous convoy of trucks hauling rubbish from across Gibraltar, the pile of waste soon swelled to some 6,000 tonnes. “It was a mountain of trash,” said Antonio Muñoz of the ecologist group Verdemar-Ecologistas en Acción. “All sorts of rubbish, all mixed together.” The organisation was among the first to sound the alarm over an unexpected consequence of Brexit: the thousands of tonnes of rubbish left with nowhere to go as the territory grappled with post-Brexit paperwork. The tiny territory had long sent its rubbish to a nearby sorting facility in the Spanish province of Cádiz. When the Brexit transition period ended, so did the arrangement. As officials in Gibraltar and London wrestled with the cumbersome processes and procedures required to ship the waste as a non-EU member, the Rock – densely populated and with an area of just 2.6 square miles – scrambled to find space for its ever accumulating waste. New equipment supplied by the UK was used to shred and compact the rubbish, freeing up space on the eastern side of Gibraltar, where the rubbish was being kept. Contingency plans laid out other options for the 30,000 tonnes of waste produced annually in the territory; from storing it in the territory’s vast network of tunnels to potentially shipping it to the UK. “It’s not something we were expecting, but something we were prepared for,” said Stephen Warr, a senior environmental officer with the government. After more than two months of accumulating waste in Gibraltar, Madrid signed off on the paperwork in late February. It took weeks to clear out the backlog of rubbish, with the last bits of refuse cleared just as Gibraltar was hit with a fierce storm that sparked swells of more than 4 metres. Ecologists described it as a close call. “If we had had that kind of powerful storm when the rubbish was there, we would be talking about plastic scattered across the Strait of Gibraltar,” said Muñoz. “The impact would have been significant. We’re talking about a key crossing for birds, cetaceans and tuna – all of it would have entered the food chain.” The Gibraltar government said precautions had been taken at the storage area to prevent the rubbish from ending up in the sea, such as a wire mesh that sits overtop and a heavy curtain capable of warding off strong winds. The use of tunnels – which this time ended up storing an estimated 10 tonnes of waste – also allows for inert rubbish to be stored without having to worry about winds. The pile up of rubbish came as talks continue about Gibraltar’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU. The British overseas territory – where 96% of voters in the 2016 Brexit referendum backed remaining in the EU – was left out of the trade deal struck between the UK and EU on Christmas Eve 2020. Instead, its fate has been the topic of months of parallel negotiations that have focused on preserving free movement across the shared border with Spain while steering clear of the centuries-old sovereignty dispute between London and Madrid. Amid initial hopes that the talks would wrap up in mid-2021, Spain’s foreign minister recently called for the negotiations to be sped up. “Talks on Gibraltar must intensify so a mutually beneficial agreement can be reached shortly,” José Manuel Albares said on Twitter after a meeting with the British foreign secretary on the sidelines of the recent Nato summit. Liz Truss said her government was “determined to make progress” on the negotiations. The drawn-out timeline is being watched carefully in Gibraltar. As is customary with permits involving waste, Madrid’s authorisation to ship the waste is set to expire within a year. “The authorisation is short term and will require renewal before the next 12 months,” the Gibraltar government said in a statement. In the meantime, the contingency equipment to shred and compact waste was being kept in place in the territory’s waste storage area. “It’s there in case we have to use it again,” said Warr. “Hopefully we don’t.”",News/World news,‘Mountain of trash’: how Gibraltar was almost buried under post-Brexit rubbish pile,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/mountain-trash-gibraltar-almost-buried-brexit-rubbish
4/14/2022,"Scott Morrison has promised he will not support “any shutdown of native forestry” as he pledged $220m for the industry as part of his bid to hang on to marginal seats in Tasmania. Echoing a successful pro-logging pitch by the former Liberal prime minister John Howard in northern Tasmania during the 2004 election campaign, Morrison said that, if re-elected, the Coalition would boost the industry by creating a national institute for forest products innovation based in Launceston and support “new wood processing technologies”. Launceston is the main centre in Bass. It is the most marginal electorate in the country and is held by the Liberals’ Bridget Archer. Forestry has also been a potent political issue in the neighbouring marginal and near-marginal seats of Braddon and Lyons. The announcement was applauded by the forestry industry but condemned by conservation groups, which said continued native forest logging would push threatened forest species, including swift parrots, greater gliders and spot-tailed quolls, closer to extinction. Morrison said the Coalition’s support for forestry was about jobs, and showed it understood “what drives regional economies”. “Forestry is key to that,” he said. “Under our government we won’t support any shutdowns of native forestry, and we will continue to work with state governments to create permanent timber production areas.” Jess Abrahams, a nature campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said anything that increased demand for native forests to be cut down was “bad news for Australian wildlife and bad news for climate action”. He cited research by the foundation that found the federal government had approved the destruction of more than 200,000 hectares of threatened species habitat in the past decade. “This figure does not even include forests that were knocked down for timber, as native forest logging is exempt from Australia’s national environment law,” he said. “We need strong environment laws that close the loophole that allows the logging industry to destroy wildlife habitat with impunity.” Former Greens leader Bob Brown, now the head of campaigning group the Bob Brown Foundation, accused Morrison of being “far to the right of John Howard, who at least promised to protect the Tarkine rainforest in Tasmania”. “Morrison’s policy is driving a range of Australian iconic species to extinction, including koalas, swift parrots, masked owls and Leadbeater’s possum, greater gliders and black cockatoos,” Brown said. Labor leader Anthony Albanese said Morrison’s forestry pledge should not be taken at face value, pointing to a 2018 promise that the Coalition would plant 1bn trees across 400,000 hectares of new plantations by 2030. Government figures show about 4,300 hectares, a little more than 1%, have been planted so far. Referring to Morrison, Albanese said: “He’ll be there for the photo op, but he’s never there for the follow-up.” Morrison said the Coalition still had time to meet the tree planting commitment. He said the new announcement would allow manufacturing and processing businesses to “maximise log recovery, process smaller diameter logs and create new and innovative wood products”, and followed a $86.2m promise to reduce the upfront cost of establishing new plantations. “The pressures on the building industry and the uncertain international trade situation has made it clear that local wood products and local skills are critical,” Morrison said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Tasmanian Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson called for an end to native forest logging and reform of plantations, many of which he said were grown at taxpayer expense before being shipped to Asia for processing. He accused Morrison of offering “another taxpayer-subsidised lifeline to support the loss-making forestry industry in Tasmania prior to an election”. The native forestry industry has been under pressure, in part due to the failure by state government agencies in Tasmania and Victoria to achieve Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, which is considered the international gold standard for forest management. Some retailers refuse to stock non-FSC certified timber. The national industry was hurt by the devastating bushfires of 2019-20 and has faced a barrage of legal challenges over its impact on threatened species. Labor governments in Western Australia and Victoria have promised to end native forestry and switch to plantations only by 2024 and 2030 respectively. In Tasmania, the state Liberal government was elected in 2014 after promising to expand logging and tear up a “peace deal” brokered between industry and conservationists under the previous Labor-Greens government in a bid to end decades of conflict over forestry. It has had limited success. While Sustainable Timber Tasmania’s annual reports show it has posted an operating profit for the past four years, the economist John Lawrence found it would have recorded losses if not for accounting measures and government grants. In 2004, the Howard-led Coalition won Bass and Braddon after promising to support timber workers while the Labor leader, Mark Latham, met with Bob Brown and promised to increase forest protection. Howard was supported across the political aisle by union leaders and the then Labor state premier Paul Lennon. The Tasmanian government backed the Morrison government announcement on Thursday. Guy Barnett, the state primary industries minister, summarised its position as “wood is good”. The Australian Forest Products Association, led by former Howard government adviser Ross Hampton, said it “strongly” welcomed the announcement. Separately on Thursday, the ABC revealed Victoria’s state-owned logging company, VicForests, had referred itself to the state’s corruption watchdog over allegations it hired a private investigator to spy on an activist.",News/Australia news,"Coalition’s $220m pledge for native forestry ‘bad news’ for threatened species, conservationists say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/14/coalitions-220m-pledge-for-native-forestry-bad-news-for-threatened-species-conservationists-say
