3/2/2022,"Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine are coming under more bombardment in the early hours of Wednesday morning as the Russian military steps up its offensive and moves forces closer towards the capital. Four people have been killed after homes in the city of Zhytomyr west of Kyiv were hit by a cruise missile apparently aimed at a nearby airbase, Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the interior minister, said on his Telegram channel. Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv has also been under more heavy bombardment after at least 11 people were killed on Tuesday. A video taken in the city shows wrecked residential buildings with no windows, and fallen trees and power lines, in the aftermath of bombing. Kharkiv and the southern cities of Kherson and Mariupol, are likely now encircled by the Russians, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Thousands of Ukrainians are trying to leave Kyiv, our correspondent in Kyiv reported, as Russia’s defence ministry warned residents to leave as it plans to strike targets in the Ukrainian capital. The UN says more than 680,000 people have already fled the city. Russia’s military move on Kyiv has stalled as its forces struggle with basic logistics challenges, including shortages of food and fuel, with some units appearing to be gripped by low morale. US official also claim that some Russian troops are sabotaging their equipment and surrendering rather than fighting. Joe Biden’s will use his State of the Union address on Tuesday night to warn Vladimir Putin that he cannot divide the west and that dictators should “pay a price for their aggression”, according to a pre-release of parts of his speech. The IMF and the World Bank have condemning the Russian action in Ukraine and the “horrifying” suffering of people there, and pledged a $3bn package of support for the country in a strongly worded joint statement. Apple has said it will pause all product sales in Russia, heeding requests from Ukrainian officials to take action against the country in response to its invasion. Boeing is suspending “major operations” in Moscow, as well as “parts, maintenance, and technical support services for Russian airlines”. Ford and the British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover have also suspended operations, along with Nike. The US and 30 countries have agreed to release 60m barrels of oil from their strategic reserves to stabilise global energy markets, the US department of energy said on Tuesday, as oil prices surged to a seven-year high. It came after Brent crude oil rose 7% on Tuesday to $104.97 a barrel. The Russian rouble has fallen again in early trading on Wednesday to hit 109.2 to the dollar. Stocks on Wall Street suffered another day of losses amid the jitters over Ukraine.

3/2/2022,"Stark disparities in cancer rates between different ethnic groups have been laid bare in new research showing black people are twice as likely to get prostate cancer while white people have double the chance of getting skin and lung cancers. The analysis of NHS Digital cancer registration data by Cancer Research UK provides the most complete recording ever of cancer rates by ethnicity in England, offering crucial data on how some rates vary. The results are published in the British Journal of Cancer. White people in England are more than twice as likely to get some types of cancer, including melanoma skin cancer, oesophageal, bladder and lung cancers compared with people from black, Asian or mixed ethnic backgrounds, according to the research. Black people are almost three times more likely to get myeloma and almost twice as likely to get prostate cancer compared with white people. The study also found that black people are more likely to get stomach and liver cancers, and Asian people are more likely to get liver cancers. These types can be linked to infections including H. pylori and hepatitis, which are more common in some minority ethnic groups. Genetics are thought to play a part in some of the findings, Cancer Research UK said. For example, white people are more likely to get skin cancer because they tend to burn more easily in the sun. Preventable risk factors also appear to be involved, the charity added, as white people are more likely than most minority ethnic groups to smoke or be overweight or obese. These are the two largest risk factors in developing cancer and help explain why white people are more likely to get some types of cancer than other ethnic groups. With some evidence suggesting smoking and obesity rates in people from black, Asian or mixed ethnic backgrounds could become similar to those in white people in future, Cancer Research UK said it was particularly concerned that cancer rates could rise in some minority ethnic groups. This is worrying, the charity said, when compounded by reports that minority ethnic patients often have worse experiences of cancer care and lower survival for some cancer types. “To date, this is the most reliable and highest-quality study on cancer incidence by ethnicity in England, which shows us there are disparities in cancer rates across different ethnicities,” said study author Dr Katrina Brown, a Cancer Research UK statistician. “Someone’s risk of developing cancer is based on many factors, including age, genetics and exposure to preventable risk factors – about 40% of cancer cases in the UK could be prevented. But the cancer incidence we see today is partly the product of smoking and obesity in decades past. If we don’t tackle these risk factors today, we could see cancer rates rise in future for people from ethnic minority groups.” Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, added: “It’s clear addressing cancer inequalities must be central to [health secretary] Sajid Javid’s new 10-year cancer plan and include being bolder on cancer prevention – tightening tobacco control and implementing, not U-turning, on obesity policy. More research is needed to understand the challenges faced by different ethnic groups and how the cancer journey differs for people.”",News/Society,Study reveals stark disparities in cancer rates between ethnic groups,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/02/study-reveals-stark-disparities-in-cancer-rates-between-ethnic-groups
3/2/2022,"Skye Swift was stuck in flood waters in the northern New South Wales town of Tweed Heads when she posted an urgent callout on social media requesting a boat ride to distribute essentials at her pharmacy. “We were all flooded out of the CBD,” the pharmacist said. “But Tuesday morning I woke up and thought, ‘I want to be at work today’. “Everyone told me I couldn’t, because the roads are closed, so I posted on Facebook saying if anyone can devise a way for me to get to Murwillumbah by boat I’ll open the pharmacy.” What she didn’t expect was for the world champion surfer Mick Fanning to answer her call. Fanning and a fellow elite surfer, Joel Parkinson, have been busy ferrying stranded residents and distributing supplies to people badly hit by floods at Tumbulgum on the north coast of NSW. An evacuation order was issued for Tumbulgum and surrounding areas on Sunday amid rising flood waters exceeding 2m, cutting off roads and access to water and power. Since the floods hit on Monday, the pair have helped rescue dozens of people and pets. More than 500 flood rescues and 927 calls for help were made in northern NSW in a 24-hour period amid the catastrophic conditions. Swift said she had seen people posting about “fellas on jet skis” and received a call from one on Tuesday morning assuring her “no worries, I’ll make it happen”. She was instructed to make her way to Tumbulgum but became stuck multiple times due to closed roads. “A guy took me on his tinnie across flooded cow paddocks towards Tumbulgum, so I got a hold of them and said, ‘I’m in a tinnie, can a jetski meet me?’ “He said keep an eye out, and … within a minute, a jetski turned up with Mick Fanning on it. “I was stoked, I was grateful, I was a little bit chuffed it was Mick for a bit of sunlight around the day.” The couple met a few hurdles along the way – they barely made it under a bridge they approached at high tide. But they “didn’t have any other options”, and got through. They also came across a boat that had run out of fuel, which Fanning towed to safety before continuing on. “Mick was pretty funny, he was like, ‘We’ve got to get Skye to the pharmacy, it’s urgent,’” Swift said. “He was adorable and lovely, he reached out last night and said, ‘If you need help getting medicines out, just give us a call.’” Swift eventually made it to the Varela and Swift Pharmacy early on Tuesday morning, and opened until late into evening. “I’ve been through the 2017 floods when we were flooded into town,” she said. “I was the only pharmacy open for four days, but this was definitely the most dramatic entrance I’ve made to work.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The customers are so grateful, I can’t believe how resilient they are. They’ve lost everything, they’ve lost businesses, their houses are still under water, we have people staying in the evacuation centre … “There’s limited supplies – no milk, no water, soon no petrol. It’s horrific, but everyone is so grateful.” Swift said many people were arriving stressed because they’d lost medicines and prescriptions. “We’re just taking care of them,” she said. She doesn’t expect she’ll be able to make it home to Tweed Heads for another day or two – the water is receding but there’s still no entry or exit. She said the good news stories, the solidarity, was “beautiful, but not enough at the end of the day”. “The mental side is amazing, but we’ve now got weeks and months of rebuilding. And how do you rebuild when you don’t have any money, a job? “It’s the aftermath that gets missed, that’s the heartbreaking part … it’s going to be a long road.”",News/Australia news,‘A jetski turned up with Mick Fanning on it’: world champion surfer ferries locals through NSW floods,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/02/a-jetski-turned-up-with-mick-fanning-on-it-world-champion-surfer-ferrying-locals-through-nsw-floods
