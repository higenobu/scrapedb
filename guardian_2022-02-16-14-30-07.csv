2/16/2022,"This will hurt tomorrow morning, warns my ageing back. But it’s a year since the vegetable patch was dug and it has to be done: creeping buttercup has run riot. Ranunculus repens is a surreptitious invader whose stolons creep over the soil, sinking deep roots from their tips and sprouting new plants that repeat the performance. Give one plant an inch and its clonal progeny will take a square yard. The buttercups are consigned to the compost bin. Leaning on the garden fork, watching a blackbird pounce on uncovered worms, I can see another weed that I missed: lesser celandine (Ficaria verna), a close relative of buttercup. Its rosette of marbled, spoon-shaped leaves has unfurled and lies flat against the soil, intercepting every available photon of weak February sunshine.  Every year, this ambitious wild flower appears somewhere new in the garden. The particular form that grows here is subspecies bulbifera, which reproduces via detachable buds called bulbils, about the size of a rice grain, that form in leaf stalk bases. By early summer the celandines will have withered, leaving these propagules on the soil surface, dormant until spring. Then, where there was one plant, there will be many cloned copies of their parent. Lifting this latest arrival in the vegetable garden reveals that it has already formed haemorrhoid-shaped underground tubers which, in accordance with the ancient doctrine of signatures, indicated its medicinal virtues and conferred its apothecary’s name, pilewort. “Bathed with the juice mixed with wine or with the sick man’s urine, [piles] are drawn together and dried up, and the pain quite taken away,” John Gerard assured sufferers in his 1597 book The Herball. For years, I’ve inadvertently transported bulbils around in mud on my boots. To a pernickety gardener, this proliferation of pilewort might seem a pain in the bum, but my aching back knows that there’s now no hope of digging it all out; nor would I want to. I like the idea of its starry yellow flowers blooming in my footsteps, providing pollen and nectar for tawny mining bees, bee flies and the first butterflies emerging from hibernation in spring. Meanwhile, the vegetable garden upstart has been transplanted under the hedge.

2/16/2022,"Australia will become the first country outside the US to make a local series of the long-running police investigative drama NCIS. The cast of NCIS: Sydney has yet to be announced but Paramount+ and Network Ten have promised the show will feature Australian stories and Australian talent.  The Australian executive producer of the original CBS drama and the creator of the spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles, Shane Brennan, will be involved in the project. The series is expected to debut globally in 2023. It is the first international spin off of the show, with other versions set in New Orleans and Hawaii. Now into its 19th season, NCIS – centred on a fictional team of naval criminal investigative service agents – is the second longest running US prime time drama after Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.

2/16/2022,"A video of a handful of screeching tanks and lumbering armoured vehicles mounting a transport train in Crimea accompanied the Russian defence ministry’s trumpeted announcement that some of the forces that have been encircling Ukraine will “head for their garrisons”. Such evidence is clearly far too tentative to amount to anything definitive, however. The movement of Russian forces towards Ukraine has been patiently documented by a group of open source intelligence analysts, relying on public domain information, including satellite imagery and a large supply of on the ground videos.  Konrad Muzyka, one such specialist, and the president of Rochan Consulting, said any withdrawals would be a welcome development – but added that “previously announced withdrawals meant more Russian troop deployments near Ukraine” and it would take at best “a few days to verify” what, on balance, was happening. Redeployments in Crimea, in any event, may be of only limited significance given how many troops – about 150,000 on some estimates – have moved up to the border, or are still exercising in Belarus, officially until 20 February, menacing Kyiv from the most direct invasion route, to the north. Rob Lee, an analyst with the Foreign Policy Centre, said the key would be waiting to see where troops who have been called forward from Russia’s far off eastern and central military districts go, particularly when the joint exercises end. If they remain nearby “Russia will have the capacity to conduct a significant escalation, though possibly not on as short notice,” he tweeted on Thursday. But if the analysts were unconvinced, scepticism was even greater in Nato. “We have not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground,” said the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, at lunchtime. Other western officials were clearer still: “We see no sign of Russian de-escalation. We see the opposite.” The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, who had held a Cobra crisis meeting earlier on Tuesday, said field hospitals were still being constructed on the border with Ukraine in Belarus – and the UK view is that forces number are still going up. Only a day earlier Britain said it believed several thousand more were in transit to the region. There is no shortage of other reasons why Russia might want to appear to sound conciliatory at this point. Over the weekend, reports circulated that US intelligence had received reports that an invasion could begin on Wednesday, an unusually precise prediction given any attack will almost certainly involve deception and surprise. Sending the opposite message the day before, and when the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, was visiting Moscow, was always going to be timely. Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, seized on the point with enthusiasm, posting on Facebook: “15 February 2022 will go into history as the day western war propaganda failed.” It was last spring, in March and April, that Russia first mobilised on the borders of Ukraine, massing as many as 100,000 troops. A drawdown was announced towards the end of April, but in reality many of the forces stayed within the region, and whose presence was again felt from late November. “We’ve also seen that sometimes they move into a position with combat ready troops and a lot of heavy equipment,” Stoltenberg said, referring to the earlier buildup. “And then they take out some of, or perhaps even most of, the troops but they leave the equipment behind.” It is easy, then to be sceptical about Russian intentions. But there are always good reasons not to go to war. The humanitarian consequences of any invasion of Ukraine, likely to be resisted by both the country’s military and its people, will be fearful. Henry Boyd, from the International Institute of Strategic Studies, argues that Russia has spent a decade expensively modernising its armed forces. The analyst argued on Tuesday that Russia would think twice about “spending this too freely in any kind of combat operation” and “given the length of time it takes to rebuild such capabilities, I think [that] will be strongly held in the minds of planners in Moscow”. But there are also reasons why Vladimir Putin might want to try and maintain the crisis at high pitch for several weeks or even months, as western officials fear. Cheaper and far less risky than an invasion would be for the Kremlin to keep Ukraine under a longer period of pressure, bringing troops back and forwards at will to try and hurt Kyiv economically and see if any opportunities emerge.",News/World news,Russian pledge of troop withdrawals met with widespread scepticism,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/russian-pledge-of-troop-withdrawals-met-with-widespread-scepticism
2/16/2022,"When it comes to ways to warm up a fashion crowd on a cold New York evening, singer Miguel performing Prince covers is probably a pretty safe bet. That’s what was served up at Michael Kors’ autumn/winter 2022 show at New York fashion week on Tuesday evening. If Kors’ shows are typically razzle-dazzle affairs with lots of invitees and celebrity guests – a February 2019 extravaganza had Barry Manilow singing Copacabana and a glitter gun – this had the star performer but it was a more intimate affair.  It was the soundtrack to an equally “up” collection worn by models including Bella and Gigi Hadid, Paloma Elsesser and Natasha Poly. More watched online. The show had been teased on Kors’ Instagram account all week and it was live-streamed on his website. This was very much a collection aimed at life outside the home. It started with the uptown polish Kors is known for – with a series of impeccably cut camel coats worn with knitwear and high boots in the same shade. This was followed by little black dresses, concrete grey knits and coats in faux crocodile or a zingy shade of orange. Designs were either made for work (a short skirt suit, a fuchsia trouser suit), travel (some models carried XXL carry-on bags) or – often – nights out. About 100 people watched Miguel, in leather trousers and trench, with a live band on stage, sing Raspberry Beret and I Would Die 4 U. They saw a yellow sequin minidress, an asymmetric silver frock, oversized faux fur coats in crayon colours and a male model wearing a feather boa worthy of Harry Styles - or, indeed, Prince. On a video call the day before his show, Kors explained the thinking behind it. “It’s about resilience, confidence, strength, and really stepping out – stepping out and sort of strutting your stuff,” he said. Coming out of the pandemic made the designer think of other moments in his history. “I thought back in the early 90s, we were at the height of the Aids pandemic. We felt that the world was ending but yet we still craved going out … And when 9/11 happened … Everyone said no one would ever live downtown in New York again. And in fact, we saw this incredible explosion of energy and glamour.” Kors hopes this optimism – in wardrobes and lifestyles – will grow now, too. “We’ve all been on this crazy rollercoaster, in every city in the world. But … people just want to go back, to gather. There are lines at the bar at the Carlyle, here in New York.” Kors’ clothes, one can surmise, are what these people might wear for their new diary dates. “I love the evening clothes,” he said, of the collection. “Most of them are in jersey so they’re comfortable. You can actually move, you can dance, you can have fun all night long.” This optimism tallies with the projection from Capri, the group that owns the Michael Kors brand, that consumers will be buying more luxury products as the world comes out of lockdowns. In June 2021, the group raised its fiscal forecast for this year. Capri now expects annual revenue in 2022 to be about $5.15bn (£3.8bn), compared to previous forecast of about $5.10bn (£3.76bn).",Lifestyle/Fashion,Michael Kors mixes uptown polish with glitz in a celebration of ‘stepping out’,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/16/new-york-fashion-week-2022-michael-kors-mixes-uptown-polish-with-glitz-in-a-celebration-of-stepping-out
2/16/2022,"Technical glitches during exams have left hundreds of trainee medical specialists in the lurch and unable to move on to advanced training and specialisation. On Monday, about 120 specialty medical trainees sitting an online written exam – which cost thousands of dollars to sit – were affected by technical failures that meant they could not complete what was, for many of them, their final exam. The Divisional Written Exam is only held once a year and sitting it is a requirement to enter specialty fields such as paediatrics, geriatrics, neurology and cardiology.  It is not the first issue the Royal Australian College of Physicians (RACP) has had with online exams, with a catastrophic technical error in 2018 forcing a whole cohort of trainee doctors to resit a crucial test. Regarding the latest glitch, an RACP spokesperson said students were affected by logon delays or other IT issues for one of the two exams. “No examination data has been lost,” the spokesperson said. “We appreciate this is a very stressful situation for our trainees, and we are sorry that they have had this experience. We are reaching out to each of the affected trainees to understand the impact this had and how we can support them to resit the exam next month.” Meanwhile, 200 psychiatry trainees could not complete a compulsory online examination, the Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE), in November due to a technical failure that the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) said it was still investigating. Many of those students are still waiting to find out how to proceed. One final-year psychiatry registrar told Guardian Australia: “This was against a background of two years of bungled examination processes which has left a bottleneck of doctors unable to gain their final qualifications to practise as psychiatrists. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Some trainees reported having attempted to sit this final examination up to five times over the [last] two years, but could not do so as the RANZCP cancelled or significantly downscaled the number of examination spots available on each occasion.” The RANZCP president-elect, Dr Elizabeth Moore, said Covid had disrupted the psychiatry exams over the past two years, but the November exam had been affected by a technical issue still under investigation in which the online platform failed. The exam was a clinical examination broken into parts known as “stations”, with breaks between each. Trainees can complete this exam at any point from several months into their traineeship, but many opt to do it towards the end of their training as their final exam. The trainees affected by the technical glitch were able to complete their first stations in the morning, but were unable to log on and complete the afternoon component. However, Moore said the RANZCP had developed an alternative assessment pathway to help many of those students affected, in consultation with trainees. If they were assessed as having passed the two stations they had completed in the morning, they were given a pass for the whole exam. Those who failed the stations had their portfolio of work reviewed by assessors to look at the trend in their work over time and to see if they had reached the standards required for passing the exam. “If educationists were satisfied the data was there to support their competency, then they were also passed on the exam,” Moore said. The remaining students are being reviewed on a case-by-case basis, Moore said, a process which is still under way. A separate technical error led to some students receiving a message late in 2021 that they had passed the November exam when they in fact had not. “All we can do is apologise for that,” Moore said. Moore rejected that the cancellations and technical failures were contributing to shortages of psychiatry specialists, slowing the entry of new staff into an already overwhelmed mental health system. If anything, the alternative assessment arrangements RANZCP had implemented as a result of the glitch was ensuring trainees were advancing, she said. However, the whole examination system is under review, she added, including how to make exams less stressful and onerous on trainees.",News/Australia news,Hundreds of Australian medical trainees face delays due to online exams glitches,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/16/hundreds-of-australian-medical-trainees-face-delays-due-to-online-exams-glitches
