12/30/2021,"Dr. Anthony Fauci said recently that he does not plan on retiring soon but if were to step down as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the 81-year-old would reportedly be eligible for the largest federal retirement package in American history. According to Forbes auditors at OpenTheBooks.com, Fauci’s 55 years of service in the federal government qualifies him for an annual retirement package of more than $350,000 which would increase through annual cost-of-living adjustments. MSNBC ANCHOR MOCKED AS 'SHAMELESSLY NEUROTIC,' 'EMBARRASSING' FOR CALLING HERSELF A 'FAUCI GROUPIE' Fauci is currently the highest-paid employee in the federal government, bringing in $434,321 in 2020 which is more than the president, the highest-ranking commanders in the military, and the roughly 4.3 million employees in the federal government. ""There's no way I’m going to walk away from this until we get this under control,"" Fauci told ABC’s Johnathan Karl earlier this month when asked about possibly stepping away from the job. ""I mean, that's the purpose of what we do. That's -- that's our mission in life. In the middle of it, I’m not going to walk away."" SHOULD AMERICANS CANCEL NEW YEAR'S EVE PLANS? FAUCI SAYS IT DEPENDS Fauci’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News. Fauci has become one of the most controversial political figures in the country after advocating for strict lockdown measures during the coronavirus pandemic which has drawn the ire of conservatives who have accused him of inconsistent positions. Republican politicians, most notably Sen. Rand Paul, who is a medical doctor, have also criticized Fauci for his agency's connection to taxpayer funds that supported gain-of-function research on bats infected with coronaviruses at a lab in Wuhan, China.

12/30/2021,"A video of a member of the Queen‘s Guard knocking over a boy who walked in his way is going viral. On Tuesday, a TikTok user shared a clip of two armed guardsmen dressed in gray tunics and bearskin caps marching in unison while on patrol outside the Tower of London. Adults and children were seen watching them nearby, including one boy who had stepped into their path. One of the guards brusquely shouted “Make way!” as he was inches away from the boy, then kept walking, knocking into him. The child fell to the ground as the man mowed over him, stepping over the boy’s head and continuing on his way. “Nobody is safe,” the TikTok user captioned the video. Nobody is safe 😢 #england #royalguards #foryou #foryoupage #london ♬ original sound – user7312510220627 A UK Ministry of Defense spokesperson told The Daily Mail of the incident, “The Guardsmen on duty warned members of the public that a patrol was approaching but the child unfortunately ran out in front of the soldier unexpectedly. The soldier tried to step over the child and continued on his duty. Following the incident, the soldier checked on the child and was reassured that all was well.’ In the TikTok video’s comments, viewers were split over whether the fault lied in the hands of the guard or the child. Those who defended the guard argued that members of the Queen’s Guard, who are responsible for protecting the monarch’s royal residences, are required to not break formation. “People are warned ahead of time where you can and can’t stand. They didn’t just kick a child unprovoked. The parents clearly didn’t listen,” one wrote. “People don’t understand that those guards aren’t there for tourist attraction and are highly trained SOLDIERS there to protect the QUEEN,” another argued. Others, meanwhile, argued that the safety of the boy should have been prioritized. “‘It’s their job’ doesn’t mean they can just trample a child, the queens not gonna die if he stepped around the kid or warned him like a metre earlier,” one commented. “There isn’t a job in this world that would make me as a human being trample a child then walk away.

12/30/2021,"The Duke of York has made an “unprecedented” request for all witness testimony taken in his sexual abuse case to be kept secret, it has emerged. He wants depositions, including his own, to remain under seal, even if neither party declares the evidence confidential. Lawyers for the Duke’s accuser, Virginia Giuffre, said there was “no logic or authority” for such a provision. The revelation was made in a letter from Sigrid McCawley, for Ms Giuffre, to Andrew Brettler, the Duke’s lead counsel, dated December 24. It was lodged with the court on Tuesday as part of a fresh bid to get the civil case thrown out. Mr Brettler has asked a judge to halt proceedings, claiming that Ms Giuffre was not a US resident and did not live in Colorado, as her lawsuit suggested. Instead, he said she lived with her husband and three children in Perth, Australia, and was therefore unable to make the claim under federal court law. Ms Giuffre, now 38, has alleged she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions in 2001, when she was 17. She is seeking unspecified damages. Both sides have indicated that they plan up to 12 depositions. Ms Giuffre’s legal team has indicated that at least two of theirs will involve British witnesses, suggesting that they could include the Duke’s former wife, the Duchess of York, and even the Prince of Wales. Before challenging the court’s jurisdiction, the Duke had been due to send proposed dates and locations for his own deposition by Monday, December 27. He had already asked for a three-week extension to respond to discovery requests “in light of the holidays and Covid.” Ms McCawley expressed frustration with the latest attempt to delay proceedings on an issue that could have been raised sooner. She said they had asked three times for the Duke to select a date for his own deposition yet he had never responded. Ms McCawley also noted that as part of the discovery process, the Duke’s lawyers had already asked for proof that Ms Giuffre was a citizen of Colorado and that they were due to respond with the relevant documents by January 14, as previously agreed. She referred to a draft protective order, drawn up at the Duke’s request, which would prevent the disclosure of certain information. But she added: “The main substantive disagreement in the parties’ drafts is your inclusion of an unprecedented paragraph, which would allow you to keep deposition materials sealed from the public even if neither party designates the underlying testimony as confidential.” She added that because there was “no logic or authority for such a provision” and because it was deemed too late to ask the court for a confidentiality order, they would raise the issue in court next Tuesday, when judge Lewis Kaplan hears arguments on the Duke’s motion to have the case dismissed. Ms McCawley told Mr Brettler that they “will be able to establish” that the New York federal court had jurisdiction. But she said that even if not, Ms Giuffre “would simply refile her claims” in New York state court, warning: “The parties in this action will need to resolve this dispute one way or another.” If current proceedings are abandoned and the lawsuit is refiled, Ms Giuffre would have to start the entire legal process from scratch. Her current claim was filed in August under New York's Child Victims Act (CVA), which lifted the statute of limitations in cases involving alleged sexual offenses against minors. However, the CVA deadline expired just days later, meaning that she would have to find another means of filing a fresh lawsuit against the Duke. Prince Andrew’s flagship business enterprise has reported a significant drop in assets. Accounts published on Wednesday show that Pitch@Palace, his Dragons Den-style initiative, has total assets of £726,324, down from £1,158,369 the previous year. The business, which previously had 15 employees, now has a monthly average of three, including sole director Arthur Lancaster, an accountant who took over to oversee what is left of the company in an administrative role. The initiative, which brokered deals between tech start-ups and wealthy investors, was thrown into disarray by the Duke's disastrous Newsnight interview in November 2019, after which its charitable arm was wound up as corporate sponsors withdrew support. The global arm, a private limited company, continued however, albeit with all references to the Duke removed from its homepage. What remained of the brand was moved out of its Buckingham Palace base to a nearby office space in London and now uses only Mr Lancaster’s office address. The accounts reveal that at the end of last March Pitch@Palace had almost £648,000 in cash, down from almost £1.18 million the previous year. An accompanying note suggests that despite the Duke’s shattered reputation, there remain plans to relaunch the initiative. It says its planned activities were wound down due to Covid and would resume when restrictions were lifted.",World/The Telegraph,Prince Andrew makes ‘unprecedented’ request for evidence in sex abuse case to be kept secret,https://news.yahoo.com/prince-andrew-makes-unprecedented-request-173831698.html
12/30/2021,"Mercedes Benz has become the latest company to face backlash in China for allegedly perpetuating Western stereotypes about Chinese people in a recent advertisement.

Driving the news: The critical response reportedly blew up on Monday after the German carmaker posted a video that featured a model with “slanted eyes.” The ad was particularly criticized for the makeup it had used on the model, which critics found to be “ugly” and “offensive.”
 The state-run Global Times claims the image of a Chinese person with “slanted eyes,” as well as braids, is a Western stereotype of the Chinese from the 19th century. The outlet further explains that the stereotype is not “an objective description… but a label for East Asians” predicated on Western supremacy. “The premise is that Chinese cannot let the West shape our aesthetics. For those malicious slander, we should maintain sufficient vigilance and counter-attack,” one Weibo user wrote, as per Global Times. Mercedes Benz, which published the video on Weibo on Dec. 25, appears to have deleted it in the wake of backlash. The company has not released a statement in relation to the matter as of this writing. 


The big picture: Mercedes Benz is the latest business to be accused of depicting Chinese people unflatteringly by consumers in the country. Last week, ads from a local snack company called Three Squirrels drew flak for similar reasons after also featuring a model with “slanted eyes.”
 Three Squirrels was forced to apologize; however, the model in question pushed back against the vitriol by asking, “Am I disqualified to be Chinese just because I have small eyes?” Dior found itself in a similar controversy in November when a Chinese photographer whose work was featured in the brand’s Shanghai exhibition provoked accusations that her work perpetuated a “Western aesthetic.” Other international brands that have faced scrutiny in China include H&M, Nike and Zara. One of the largest cases to date involved Dolce & Gabbana, which most recently faced a $660 million defamation lawsuit.

12/30/2021,"Valesky Barosy — online, at least — was living the high-life in Miami: driving an exotic Lamborghini, posing on a private jet, boasting an Instagram account with over 110,000 followers. His touted himself as an immigrant success story, arriving from Haiti a decade ago, working his way up from a menial job at Walmart to “regional vice president” of a credit repair company that purportedly racks up “$3.6 million in sales.” But in reality, federal authorities say, the 27-year-old Barosy and his cohorts were ripping off taxpayers, fraudulently securing $2.1 million in loans to buy the peak Miami status symbols: a Lamborghini Huracán EVO, Rolex and Hublot watches, and designer clothing from Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Chanel. A federal grand jury has now indicted Barosy on charges of wire fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft. The indictment was unsealed Wednesday as Barosy made his first appearance in a Fort Lauderdale federal court. Barosy is being held in federal detention. His defense attorney did not return a call seeking comment on Wednesday. The Payroll Protection Program, or PPP, was created in 2020 to help businesses decimated following shutdowns caused by the rapid spread of the coronavirus. The program allowed for the loans to be forgiven, if borrowers followed criteria laid out by the Small Business Administration, or SBA. As the nation’s No. 1 fraud capital, South Florida has led the financial crime wave that followed the passage of the CARES Act, according to federal prosecutors. In South Florida, that’s included a businessman using PPP money to buy a $318,000 Lamborghini, a nurse alleged to have lied about his business to get $474,000 that was used in part to pay a Mercedes-Benz lease and child support, and a North Miami suburban couple that claimed to be farmers to qualify for $1 million in relief benefits. This month, two Florida men pleaded guilty to helping arrange over $35 million in PPP loans. The ring also netted the conviction of former NFL player Joshua Bellamy, who was sentenced to more than three years in prison for wire-fraud conspiracy. As for Barosy, according to the indictment, he was the president of a company known as VBarosySolutions Inc., or VBS. For various loans, per the feds, Barosy dummied up prior-year expenses, net profit, and payroll, and submitted bogus IRS tax forms to secure the payments, which were then used to buy the Lambo, the watches and the clothes. He wasn’t bashful about flaunting his wealth. On Instagram, he posed often with the white Lambo, pitching himself as a mentor who could inspire — and enrich. “It’s not the Lamborghini or the million dollar home that will inspire the world but the trials and tribulations you overcame,” he wrote in one post. Although the details are nebulous, his online bios tout Barosy as a “7 Figure Entrepreneur” complete with all the 2021 buzz words: “NFT Creator, Marketing, e-commerce,” and vaguely boasts having appeared on ABC, Fox News and “Miami News.” “How This Haitian Entrepreneur Went From Walmart To Disrupting The Multi-Million Dollar Credit Repair Industry,” blared the headline of one “press release.” Additionally, he boasts being part of Financial Education Services Inc. — a company described by Georgia’s Attorney General as an “illegal credit repair business” that uses “unlawful and deceptive practices in their multi-level marketing structure.” The company in 2019 agreed to pay a $1.75 million fine to the state of Georgia over its practices. The company appears to now go by the name United Wealth Education. The investigation was headed by the U.S. Secret Service. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Bailyn is prosecuting the case, while federal prosecutor Nicole Grosnoff will oversee efforts to seize his ill-gotten goods.

12/30/2021,"The man suspected in a deadly hit-and-run crash that killed two South Florida children tussled with deputies in a wild courtroom confrontation Wednesday. The man, Sean Charles Greer, 27, was arrested Tuesday and booked on a slew of charges connected to Monday's crash, which killed Andrea Fleming, 6, and Kylie Jones, 5, Broward County sheriff's deputies said. After charges were read in a Fort Lauderdale courtroom Wednesday, the handcuffed, heavily tattooed Greer struggled with a deputy and knocked over a podium. He angrily said, “You can’t make me stay in this [inaudible]!” as he was led away. Judge Joseph Murphy called Greer an ""extreme flight risk"" and ordered him held without bond.

12/30/2021,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — It's not often that bacon leads a roundup of new laws taking effect with the New Year in California. But even in progressive California, that's the headline-grabber. It's among a host of other legislation designed to safeguard employees, shield those seeking abortions, protect protesters from police, spare children from gender influence in store displays, and further ease criminal penalties to reduce mass incarceration. Several of the laws mark national “firsts” — first minimum wage to reach $15 an hour, first to protect warehouse workers from quotas, first to mandate hourly wages for garment workers, first to require the gender-neutral displays. They are among hundreds of new laws also addressing everything from stealthily removing condoms to handing out disposable packages of condiments. But first... WHAT ABOUT THE BACON? The sausage-making stems from a 2018 ballot measure where California voters set the nation's toughest living space standards for breeding pigs starting Jan. 1. Industry lawsuits opposing the initiative failed, but grocers and restauranteurs are now suing to force a 28-month delay. Critics including some lawmakers of both parties have called for putting off enforcement until 2024 for fear prices will rise and jobs will be lost. California is allowing the continued sale of pork processed under the old rules, which proponents say should blunt any shortage and price surge. $15 MINIMUM WAGE California becomes the first state to require a $15-an-hour minimum wage for businesses with more than 25 employees, though Washington, D.C., and many California cities in the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas already reached that milestone. The minimum for businesses with 25 or fewer employees bumps to $14 with the new year and will increase to $15 per hour on Jan. 1, 2023. From then on, the wage will rise annually based on inflation. The increases were set in motion by a 2016 law. Similarly, Illinois and New Jersey are boosting their minimum wage by $1 each year until they hit $15 an hour in 2025. HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS Gov. Gavin Newsom promised to double down on addressing California's affordable housing and related homelessness problem after he handily defeated a recall election in September. Days later, he approved two measures designed to sidestep local zoning ordinances. One allows local governments to rezone neighborhoods near mass transit for up to 10 housing units. The second requires cities to approve up to four housing units on what was a single-family lot, over the objections of municipal leaders. Some cities were rushing to pass ordinances undercutting the law before it takes effect, while other opponents are gathering signatures for a ballot measure that would restore local control. PROTECTING EMPLOYEES California becomes the first U.S. state to bar warehouse retailers like Amazon from firing workers for missing quotas that interfere with bathroom and rest breaks. It also becomes the first state to require the garment industry to pay workers by the hour. It also now bars secret employment settlements involving discrimination based on race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, expanding on a 2018 law. EDUCATION Among two-dozen new higher education laws are two that try to make it easier for students in community colleges to transfer into public universities. One streamlines an application process that students have described as a maze, while another requires community college classes to have the same course numbers as the comparable courses in four-year colleges to reduce confusion. RECYCLING AND WASTE California is expanding on its existing law that allows restaurants to distribute single-use straws only upon request. Now take-out places can give consumers single-use condiment packages like ketchup and mustard and utensils like knives, forks and spoons only if asked. It's among numerous new laws designed to cut waste. One sets what advocates call the nation’s strictest standards for the “chasing arrows” recycling symbol. Another toughens regulations for what can be used in compost. Yet what California regulators say is the “biggest change to trash in 30 years” comes from a law passed in 2016 that takes effect Jan. 1. It requires local governments to provide organics recycling collection to all residents and businesses, and phases in a requirement for businesses and large food generators to donate unsold food to distribute to Californians in need. GENDER-NEUTRAL STORE DISPLAYS California becomes the first state to require large department stores — those with at least 500 employees — to display products like toys and toothbrushes in gender-neutral ways. The requirement does not include clothes and does not ban traditional boys' and girls' sections. But it says large stores must also have a gender-neutral section displaying a “reasonable selection” of items “regardless of whether they have been traditionally marketed for either girls or for boys.” Enforcement won't start until Jan. 1, 2024. RESTRICTING POLICE Several laws that fizzled in 2020 despite national unrest over the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis officer were signed into law in 2021. They include measures limiting police use of rubber bullets against protesters and providing a way to decertify troubled officers, though some of the certification process doesn't take effect until January 2023. Other new laws bar a type of restraint hold that has led to deaths and specify when officers have a duty to intervene to prevent or report excessive force. Another expands the list of police misconduct records that must be made public. The state also is increasing the minimum age  to become a police officer from 18 to 21 and requiring the state attorney general to investigate all fatal shootings by police of unarmed civilians, including those where there is a reasonable dispute over whether that civilian was armed. EASING CRIMINAL PENALTIES California is taking additional steps to ease criminal penalties, building on a decade of efforts to reduce mass incarceration. Among them, it is ending mandatory minimum prison or jail sentences for nonviolent drug offenses, thus giving judges more discretion to impose probation or other alternative sentences. It is expanding on a 2019 law that limited the use of the felony murder rule, which previously allowed accomplices in felonies to be convicted of murder if someone died but now is restricted to people who intended to kill or directly participated. And it is creating the presumption that those arrested on allegations of violating their probation be freed on their own recognizance unless a judge deems them to be a public safety or flight risk. It is also limiting prison terms for those associated with street gangs, considering mitigating circumstances in applying sentencing enhancements, and retroactively removing other enhancements for repeat offenders and certain prior drug crimes.",U.S./Associated Press,Bringing home the bacon tops new California laws in 2022,https://news.yahoo.com/bringing-home-bacon-tops-california-160536463.html
