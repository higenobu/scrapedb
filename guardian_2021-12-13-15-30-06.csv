12/13/2021,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to start the week.  Boris Johnson has launched an unprecedented “national mission” to supercharge the Covid vaccination programme so that 1m booster jabs can be delivered every day in order to stem the incoming “tidal wave of Omicron” and avoid imposing further restrictions. The army will be deployed across the country to help rapidly accelerate the vaccine programme from current daily levels of around 530,000, and GPs will be told to cancel appointments to dedicate resources to offering vaccines to every UK adult by the end of the month. In a televised address to the nation last night, the prime minister said he was “afraid we are now facing an emergency in our battle with the new variant”. The UK record for daily jabs is 844,000 in March. Here’s an explainer on the new plan and how to get your booster, and analysis on what makes a booster shot so important in fighting Omicron. Authorities in New Zealand, meanwhile, are investigating claims that a man received 10 Covid jabs in one day after being paid by anti-vaxxers to take the shot for them. You can read more about this and other developments in the pandemic at our live blog here. Tory rebellion – The expansion of the booster scheme is seen as a gamble on short-term pain for long-term gain by Johnson, who is also facing open warfare in the Tory party over the move to plan-B restrictions. Up to 100 MPs could oppose the changes on Tuesday as he battles on multiple fronts to contain the damage from reports of a series of parties in Downing Street last year, which have left MPs openly discussing a vote of no confidence. Although the measures will pass because Labour supports the government on Covid passports for large venues and more mask wearing, the opposition senses Johnson’s vulnerability to attack on the parties affair and has accused him of potentially misleading parliament. Met sued – The family of the murdered private detective Daniel Morgan are to sue the Metropolitan police for damages, alleging that a decades-long cover-up of corruption is continuing. An inquiry in June found that the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, obstructed the panel appointed to investigate claims that corruption blighted the hunt for Morgan’s killers and that the Met had failed to root it out. The Met rejected the findings. Morgan was found with an axe in his head in south London in 1987. Tornado ‘disaster’ – Joe Biden has declared a major federal disaster in Kentucky after a swarm of deadly tornadoes hit the state on Friday. The US president’s decision paves the way for additional aid, as thousands face housing, food, water and power shortages. Kentucky governor Andy Beshear had initially said the death toll could exceed 100 – many of them in a flattened candle factory – after the twisters tore through the US midwest and south. But he said last night that the death toll might be as low as 50. One worker who survived the carnage at the candle factory has spoken of an agonising wait to see if her boyfriend can be found alive in the wreckage. Biden has asked the US environmental protection agency to investigate what role the climate crisis might have played in the freak weather events. Body found – Police have found the body of a woman in Camberwell, south London, after days of appeals for information to trace missing NHS worker Petra Srncova, who was last seen in the area on 28 November. The body is awaiting formal identification, but police said Srncova’s family have been informed of this development. The 32-year-old Czech, a senior nurse assistant at Evelina London children’s hospital in Westminster, is thought to have disappeared while travelling home to Camberwell. ‘Cultural vandalism’ – Campaigners fear the roads agency in England is pushing ahead with plans to destroy or fill with concrete more than a dozen Victorian bridges despite a government pause after an outcry over “cultural vandalism”. Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that the agency has spent tens of thousands of pounds on the sites and activists fear it presages more filling in or demolition. Breakthroughs in computing have changed how high-level chess is played, making stalemates all too common. But the Norwegian champion’s stunning performance in Dubai wrests the game back from the grip of the supercomputers, says our US deputy sport editor Bryan Graham Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3 Starting with the Lapland New Forest fiasco 13 years ago, not-very-wonderful winter wonderlands have become something of a seasonal fixture. We’ve talked to people who worked at some of them, from underpaid elves to grumpy Santas. As one worker put it: “Christmas is meant to be a time for happiness, but we only saw misery – exhausted parents, insane children and short tempers all round.” Max Verstappen celebrated winning his first Formula One world championship with victory over Lewis Hamilton at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, but only after huge controversy that still leaves his title in some doubt. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad are “fit and ready to go” for the pink-ball Ashes Test starting on Thursday in Adelaide, while Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood has been ruled out due to a side strain and is in a race to be fit for Boxing Day. Tuesday’s Premier League match between Brentford and Manchester United has been placed in doubt after a number of Ralf Rangnick’s squad tested positive for Covid-19. James Maddison scored once and had a hand in two other goals as Leicester outclassed a shambolic Newcastle 4-0, while Conor Gallagher scored twice for Crystal Palace in a 3-1 win against Everton and defiant defending by Burnley earned them a 0-0 draw against West Ham at Turf Moor. Paul Struthers, the chief executive of the Professional Jockeys’ Association, has accepted that Bryony Frost was bullied by fellow rider Robbie Dunne, and that the organisation was wrong to say she only “felt” bullied in previous statements. Covid-hit Munster took advantage of a first-half red card for Wasps’ Brad Shields to win 35-14 in the Champions Cup, while Sale produced an archetypal game of two halves in their 21-13 win over the Ospreys. Manchester United won for the first time in five games in the WSL when they comfortably defeated Hope Powell’s Brighton 2-0. And goals from Karim Benzema and Marco Asensio fired Real Madrid to victory over their city rivals Atlético to go eight points clear in La Liga. A third of UK small businesses are planning to make staff redundant over the next few months, rising to more than four in 10 in London, according to a survey of more than 400 firms. Many also said they would be forced to raise prices because of Britain’s supply chain problems. The UK’s housing market is likely to return to more normal levels of activity in 2022 but will still be busy, according to Rightmove, as the industry braces for a possible interest rate rise on Thursday. The FTSE100 is poised to climb 0.3% at the opening bell, while the pound is on $1.326 and €1.172. Almost every paper leads with the ramping up of the Covid booster programme. “PM bets on 1m jabs a day to halt ‘tidal wave’ of Omicron” is the main story in the Guardian, while the Telegraph goes with “One million jabs a day in race to avoid new year lockdown”. The Mail has “Boris’s million jabs a day booster rocket” and the Express headline reads “Emergency! Race for all to get boosters”. The Mirror says “Get your booster now”, the i has “Get booster to beat Omicron ‘tidal wave’”, and the Times line is “Booster jab for every adult by end of month”. The Northern Echo has “This is an emergency” and the Sun puns with “OMIGAWD!”. Only the Financial Times diverges from the Covid story, preferring: “Ukraine blames Germany for blocking Nato weapons supply”.

12/13/2021,"The night sky is set to be illuminated across Australia this week, as the annual Geminid meteor shower begins peaking on Tuesday morning. The meteor shower is expected to be at its most visible between 3am and 4am in every major city, and although the meteor shower runs until Monday 20 December, it is expected to peak on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.  Those patient enough to stay awake or set the alarm should be rewarded, with the Geminids considered one of the most spectacular meteor showers of the year. Each year, Earth passes through debris from an asteroid called 3200 Phaethon. Bits of it are constantly breaking off, burning up in the atmosphere and streaking across the night sky. “This asteroid goes around the sun, bits of rock fall off of it as it goes and it kind of leaves like a wake like a boat, just going through the water,” astronomer Dr Brad Tucker from the Australian National University said. “When we say there’s an annual meteor shower, we know that we’ll cross the same point, about this same location about the same time, but there’s some small variations that really change how many we can see. “And the Geminids are always one of the more dependable ones, because we pass at a time when we see generally quite a few good ones of them.” The Geminids get their name from the radiant – the point in the sky they appear from – which is in the Gemini constellation, above the north-east horizon. Major cities should see “a couple dozen an hour,” during the peak, Tucker says, with conditions looking good for getting a clear view. “Clouds, moon and city lights are always the big three, and you can always get away from city lights. Astronomically, the moon is convenient this year, and then the cloud cover is always weather dependent. “Which is why I think it’s always nice that this meteor shower kind of provides good rates over a few days. People were seeing some last night, and tonight and tomorrow morning should be really good.” “Even in the major cities, you should be able to still see a couple of dozen per hour. We always feel lucky to see one shooting star, so seeing a couple of dozen per hour is pretty cool.” Timing is essential to seeing as much of the meteor shower as possible. Tucker says the shower is most vibrant once the moon sets. “The best viewing is 3-4am across Australia. But when the moon sets will depend on your location, but pretty much by 2am local, the moon has set all over the country. “That’s kind of the best chance to really start seeing it because you want that moon to be out of the way and the area of the sky to be as high as possible. So if you go outside and see the moon, it’s too early. “If you go outside and it’s gone, you’re in business.” He says the further north you are, the better the view will be, and that the shower will be visible to the naked eye, and that residents should try and find a dark spot to observe from. Tucker also advises heading to a nearby park or oval to watch the meteor shower, anywhere with an unobstructed view of the sky, and to continue looking north. Keen meteor watchers will need to be patient, and allow time for their eyes to adjust to the darkness, which could take up to 30 minutes. “Having a nice clear view and as dark as possible, even in the cities, can mean that you’ll get a couple of dozen. And obviously, the darker (the spot), the better.” Although the best show will come in the early hours of the morning, there are also some “Earth-grazing” meteors that will be visible earlier in the night. You can see them at the following local times: Brisbane – 9pm Darwin – 9.30pm Perth – 10pm Sydney – 10.30pm Canberra – 10:45pm Adelaide – 11:00pm Melbourne – 11:00pm Hobart – 11.30pm",News/Science,Geminid meteor shower 2021: how to see the spectacular event in Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/13/geminids-meteor-shower-2021-peak-australia-when-what-time-how-to-see-geminid-tonight-night-sky
12/13/2021,"Insect DNA has been gathered from the air and for the first time used to detect 85 insect species, according to scientists from Lund University in Sweden. Bees, moths, flies, beetles, wasps and ants have been identified in a study which raises hopes that airborne environmental DNA (eDNA) could become a useful tool in monitoring insect abundance and declines in biodiversity.  The study, which sampled air from three sites in Sweden, also detected evidence of plants, algae, fungi and vertebrates, including a woodpigeon, fieldfare, hedgehog, red squirrel and short-tailed field vole, alongside the presence of domesticated animals – chickens, cows and dogs. The results, which have yet to be peer-reviewed, are this week presented at the British Ecological Society’s Ecology Across Borders conference by the lead author, Fabian Roger. “In the face of the biodiversity crisis, we desperately need better information on the status and distribution of species,” said Roger. “Our study is a proof of concept that shows that we can detect DNA from insects and vertebrates from air collected under natural conditions. This opens many exciting possibilities for species monitoring and detection, which could allow us to comprehensively monitor biodiversity at large spatial and temporal scales.” Sampling of eDNA has so far focused on aquatic ecosystems, and is undertaken by ecological consultants surveying for great crested newts. In this study, researchers compared airborne eDNA sampling with traditional insect surveys, including moth light traps and transect walks, which usually only pick up larger insect species. While traditional light traps detected 48 species of moth, just nine moth species were detected with eDNA, although five of these were missed by the traditional traps. Of the 36 species of butterfly and bee identified by a transect walk, eDNA sampling detected five species. The eDNA sampling was more successful at picking up a wider range of arthropod species, finding a total of 67 species at the light trap and 20 at the transect site. According to Roger, developing airborne eDNA sampling to complement traditional methods will require increasing the sensitivity of the sampling to achieve more reliable detection and developing a greater understanding of how airborne eDNA is generated, transported and how it degrades. “We are at the very beginning of exploring airborne environmental DNA for anything other than bacteria, pollen or spores – and even there we have only scratched the surface,” he said. “Just because it doesn’t work perfectly out of the box doesn’t mean it won’t work ever, and the potential is huge.”",News/Environment,Airborne DNA used to detect insect species in breakthrough for ecologists,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/13/airborne-dna-used-to-detect-insect-species-in-breakthrough-for-ecologists
12/13/2021,"The amount spent making Hollywood hits such as the latest Indiana Jones film and big-budget dramas including Star Wars TV spin-off Andor in the UK this year is on track to hit a record £6bn, thanks to a pandemic-fuelled spending spree by streaming giants and broadcasters battling for supremacy in the global TV wars. The investment in making films and high-end TV shows costing at least £1m an episode in the UK this year will be more than double the £2.8bn in 2020 – when the production industry ground to a halt for months – and a staggering two-thirds more than the previous record set in pre-pandemic 2019.  The figures highlight the growing intensity of the streaming wars led by Netflix, Amazon and more recently Disney that has in turn forced broadcasters such as Sky, the BBC and ITV to invest significantly more in big-budget content. Spending on high-end TV shows hit £3.3bn in the year to the end of September, according to the latest figures from the British Film Institute, well in excess of the £1.4bn so far committed to making feature films in the UK. In the previous two years, spending on UK-made films and prestige TV shows has been at almost identical levels. “We are experiencing a boom. We have seen incredible growth in the first three quarters this year,” said Ben Roberts, the chief executive of the BFI. “The streamers have been taking huge amounts of studio space in the UK. And the number of streamers making content here is expanding; for a long time it was only Netflix, which means we are seeing considerable growth in content demand.” When the spending on productions in the final quarter is revealed in the new year the total is likely to hit, or even surpass, £6bn as streamers and broadcasters race to replenish their content libraries after the production pipeline delay last year. While the UK has for many years proved extremely popular as a base – thanks to a combination of generous tax relief, a highly skilled workforce and talent base – the speed with which production was able to restart has given the country a competitive edge as a location of choice. Initiatives include the £500m government-backed insurance scheme, which has so far enabled more than 1,000 productions with budgets worth £2.6bn to be made, plus the quick introduction of Covid health and safety protocols and quarantine exemptions for essential crew and talent to fly to the UK. “I don’t think I would say we are ‘stealing’ productions from other countries,” said Roberts. “[Hollywood] studios and streamers have made the UK a major base. The UK is a natural and often first port of call for productions. There is no sign of us ‘nicking’ productions from elsewhere.” However, in August Amazon made the surprise decision to move its $1bn-plus Lord of the Rings production to the UK, having filmed just one series in New Zealand. “That was an Amazon choice, not ours,” said Roberts. The UK has been awash with almost 200 TV and film productions this year including Netflix’s The Witcher and The Sandman, Disney’s Andor, Aardman Animations’ Chicken Run 2, Wonka, Aquaman 2 and Dungeons & Dragons. Last month, Netflix struck a deal to double the size of its base at Shepperton Studios, where it has made productions including the TV series Enola Holmes and the Charlize Theron film The Old Guard, and spent about $1bn this year making 60 TV shows and films in the UK. Disney has a similar large-scale deal at Pinewood Studios, where Star Wars and Marvel films are based, and Apple has secured facilities in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. The streaming wars have sparked a response from traditional broadcasters with Sky, which is building a new large-scale complex at Elstree in Hertfordshire, with Comcast-owned stablemate Universal Studios, unveiling its biggest-ever slate of original content investing in 125 TV series and films this year.",News/Media,Streaming boom pushes big budget production spending in UK to record £6bn,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/13/streaming-boom-pushes-big-budget-production-spending-in-uk-to-record-6bn
12/13/2021,"The big story of the start of the year was Nomadland, Chloé Zhao’s soulful follow-up to 2017 breakout The Rider. That film received a belated UK release in May, a month after Nomadland swept the board at the Oscars, taking best picture, director and actress. Both films see the Chinese director immersing herself in a rural American subculture so seamlessly that one would assume she’s always been there, an outsider who chooses to listen first with patience and grace. A loose adaptation of Jessica Bruder’s non-fiction book, it follows Fern (played by Frances McDormand), a widow whose home town has died, one of the many industrial fatalities of the 2008 recession. She’s been displaced (her town’s zip code was discontinued in 2011) and so decides to pack up, take her most important belongings with her in a van and go on the road.  The “houseless but not homeless” community that Fern encounters and slowly becomes a part of is one that, for many, will be fascinatingly new and in her process of revealing this under-reported world to us, Zhao employs real nomads to tell their stories alongside McDormand. Their involvement, and their words, help to ground the film, often making it feel like we’re switching between a documentary and a narrative feature (the breathtaking cinematography from Zhao’s three-times collaborator Joshua James Richards reminds us it’s the former). Coming straight from Three Billboards, outsider art in all of the wrong ways, McDormand is remarkable, deftly ingratiating herself with those around her without ever seeming like an Oscar winner slumming it with normies, a turn as sensitive and as unpatronising as the film surrounding her. Her emotions are restrained but her predicament, told gradually and in fragments, is at first devastating and ultimately liberating, speaking not only to those who have been left gutted by corporate culture but also those who are single or childless or over 60 or seen in any way as “other”. It’s a film about regaining power after feeling powerless, not by taking on the system but by removing one’s self from it entirely (scenes of her briefly returning to “normal” society have us as anxious as she is for a return to the safety of her van and the freedom of the road). Without overstating its themes, Nomadland subtly captures profound snapshot of America. The confines of a cruel economic infrastructure might limit the space for some people to exist yet the sheer expanse of the country allows them to find their own space instead.",Arts/Film,"The 50 best films of 2021 in the UK, No 5: Nomadland",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/13/the-50-best-films-of-2021-in-the-uk-no-5-nomadland
12/13/2021,"Lang Lang comes as a package deal. Even after a lay-off due to an arm problem he still has his wondrous piano technique. He always offers himself as a wholly serious musician. He is certainly an important one – an inspiration to millions. But he is also one of the most mannered maulers of the repertoire you are ever likely to encounter. This Barbican recital showcased all of it. No pianist playing Bach’s Goldberg Variations – they were prefaced by Schumann’s Op 18 Arabesque – is trying to take the public’s money for old rope. One or two tiptoed exits during the Goldbergs suggested some were not getting what they had expected. Be clear, too, that there were moments of dazzlingly appropriate Bach playing, as in the lightning fast skips and shadings of the 14th variation, where Lang’s quicksilver touch was a delight.  Too often, though, Lang seemed intent on smothering the music with love, in little details as well as the big picture. When he plays fast, he is very fast; when he is slow, he is funereal. The opening aria was pulled about with such elongated exaggeration that its role as the heartbeat of the 30 variations that follow was lost. The celebrated 25th variation, whose stillness and chromaticism are the emotional crux of the work, was stretched beyond belief and almost came to a halt. Some Lang idiosyncrasies worked, like his habit of suddenly spotlighting a previously unnoticed jaunty rhythmic figure. He was alive, too, to articulating the ground bass that holds the structure together. At other times, though, the quirkiness becomes perverse. The mannered dynamics that Lang imposed on the last Quodlibet variation, one of the most sociable moments in the Goldbergs, meant that the following return of the opening aria felt like an add-on rather than a reflective return from a long musical journey. Andras Schiff once said he always hopes audiences will leave without applause after the Goldbergs. No chance of that here. The fans were on their feet immediately. It’s all part of the deal.",Arts/Music,Lang Lang review – Bach’s Goldbergs are smothered with love,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/13/lang-lang-review-bachs-goldbergs-are-smothered-with-love
12/13/2021,"In 2010, Tyler, the Creator tweeted that he wanted a Gangsta Grillz tape, the prolific DJ Drama mixtape series which informed much of the best hip-hop of the 2000s. Tyler has lived out a lot of his dreams in the intervening years. After his collective Odd Future changed the game in the early 2010s, their hellraising gave way to radical art from members Frank Ocean, Earl Sweatshirt, Syd and Tyler, who became one of the most respected rappers and producers around. He’s collaborated with many of the artists he obsessed over back then. He’s written music scores and scripted TV shows; he won a Grammy; he runs a revered fashion line and a successful festival. His sixth album, Call Me If You Get Lost, finds the artist reaching 30 and reflecting on his life so far: the joys and luxuries (“It’s opulence, baby!”), his growth from the shock-rap days in the context of contemporary social media “activism” (“Internet bringin’ old lyrics up like I hide the shit”), and the sacrifices along the way (“Everyone I ever loved had to be loved in the shadows”). Between tracks, DJ Drama “hosts” the record, offering wry tags and playful stories from their global travels (like how in Switzerland, “a young lady just fed me French vanilla ice-cream!”). Gangsta Grillz tapes have fallen off the mainstream radar in recent years: for Tyler to breathe new life into the format in 2021 is a testament not only to his ambition and vision, but his ability to fulfil them.  Call Me If You Get Lost is decadent and luxurious, wielding samples curated with the expertise of a true crate-digger. There’s the bass clarinet that swims through opener Sir Baudelaire (lifted from Billy Cobham via Westside Gunn), the humid meandering flute on Hot Wind Blows; the mesmerising, shiny Houston R&B on Wusyaname, and the deliciously wobbly, heated quasi-Lovers Rock of Sweet/I Thought You Wanted to Dance. Features from the likes of Lil Wayne, Pharrell and even Tyler’s mum enhance and embellish without detracting. Compositionally, CMIYGL is a showcase of Tyler’s reverence and nostalgia for what came before, channelled into his own present and future. Of course, also central to this album’s beauty is the fact that Tyler can rap, crafting engaging tales out of deft, intentional flow. He has always been a romantic, but here he bears a softer side than ever, forced to recognise that love, so often, is about timing. It might seem like it’s all coming together for him, but look between the cracks of the polished veneer and wanderlust and there is caustic frustration and yearning. During the eight minutes of Wilshire, he recounts in raw detail “the only thing missing” in his life, falling for the partner of a friend, and the heavy guilt as he tries to figure out what to do. He continues that he has to keep his loved ones “safe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts / ’Cause it’s just a story for the people outside of it / But I guess you’re just another chapter in the book”. For all that he can brag about his successes and achievements (though, in the interest of being humble, he notes on Blessed that he still can’t get his hair to grow), they have obstructed his ability to live a normal life. (Yet in telling this muddy story, he has given way to speculation on who the friend and would-be lover are, arguably predestining them to the same.) “Come get lost with me,” Tyler offers on Blessed. It’s a tender invitation that comes late into an album that has already guided the listener through a bright, expansive and occasionally sentimental world drawn together seamlessly, with the tracks – in true mixtape fashion – melding into one another. So often, we focus on beginnings and endings. On Call Me If You Get Lost, Tyler, the Creator masterfully reminds us that life is all about the journey, growth, confusion, pain and magic in between.",Arts/Music,"The 50 best albums of 2021, No 5: Tyler, the Creator – Call Me If You Get Lost",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/13/the-50-best-albums-of-2021-no-5-tyler-the-creator-call-me-if-you-get-lost
12/13/2021,"Astone’s throw from the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, in the National Gallery, you can see what the old Flemish painters made of the story of the holy family’s flight into Egypt, Here, with John Eliot Gardiner’s Monteverdi Choir and Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique giving their first concert in their new home venue, you could hear Berlioz’s take on it. The forces had already performed it in Zurich and in Ely Cathedral, and have a single date in Barcelona this week, which presumably counts as a European tour post-Brexit. L’Enfance du Christ is full of Berlioz’s characteristic mood swings and grand, colourful gestures: it’s an oratorio that sounds as though it desperately wants to be an opera, perfect for the characterful period winds and brass of Gardiner’s orchestra and for the top-flight cast of soloists he had assembled here. Michael Spyres’s glowing Narrator, Ann Hallenberg’s beatific Mary and Lionel Lhote’s desperate yet noble Joseph – it would have been good to hear more of all three, but Berlioz doesn’t put the spotlight squarely on any one soloist. The smaller roles were taken by singers from the choir; Alexander Ashworth made especially vivid work of the Ishmaelite who takes the family in.  Only William Thomas’s Herod came across as less than authoritative, looking a little wooden as he sang Herod’s wakeful monologue, however cavernous and velvety his voice. But perhaps that’s not so inappropriate for the troubled ruler Berlioz paints so keenly in the orchestra. The violins imitated the phrases of his aria so fervently that you almost felt sorry for him. The way the choir sang the Shepherds’ Farewell made it feel almost like a shared oration in this church setting, and angels, sung by the Trinity Boys Choir from somewhere beyond the balcony, made their spine-tingling effect. When it came to the musical entertainment that’s laid on for the holy family at their new home, Gardiner sat down and just let the trio get on with it – and it was beautifully, energetically played by flautists Gareth Davies and David Westcombe and harpist Gwyneth Wentink. The concert was being filmed, which was unobtrusive until near the end, when on a couple of occasions Gardiner restarted sections immediately after a smudged entry. Was it to get these perfect for the final edit? It was barely noticeable – but how are we to experience a performance entirely in the moment if the conductor demonstrably isn’t doing so?  The concert will be available on for DG Stage (£) from 22 to 29 December.",Arts/Music,L’Enfance du Christ review – characterful and vivid Berlioz,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/13/berlioz-lenfance-du-christ-review-john-eliot-gardiner-monteverdi-choir-st-martin-in-the-fields
12/13/2021,"After the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer earlier this year, a dam burst. Women came out on to the streets of Britain to protest against male violence, only to be met with police violence. That dam is still flooding: at least 133 women in the UK have died at the hands of a man in 2021 so far. Countless more will have taken their own lives as a consequence of male violence. Women are tired of reading the names of the women killed by femicide each year, they are tired of reading about the increase in the reports of sexual violence and domestic violence, and they are tired of the failure of the criminal justice system to tackle the problem – as the virtual collapse of rape prosecutions over the past three years shows.  But perhaps for the first time in living memory, tackling the pandemic of violence against women and girls (VAWG) is high on the political agenda. I have been working in this area since the 1990s – as a lawyer and founder of the Centre for Women’s Justice (CWJ), which aims to change the structural disadvantage women and girls face across the criminal justice system. In the past five years alone, I have represented survivors of the serial rapist John Worboys in their action against the Metropolitan police, which failed to investigate him; represented Sally Challen and other women who killed abusive partners; and am currently involved in a super complaint about the failure to address police-perpetrated domestic abuse. However, in my experience, the attitudes of prosecutors and judges towards women are as bad as ever. While initial announcements from the government were kneejerk and ill thought through – such as undercover police officers in nightclubs or apps to track women’s routes home – there may be substantial changes coming. This month, the government announced legislation that will put a new legal duty on local public bodies to tackle domestic abuse and sexual offences and has just announced plans for a new victim’s law. Meanwhile, there is growing pressure to make VAWG part of the strategic policing requirement – which would bring it in line with other serious crimes such as organised crime and terrorism. Increasing the resources of police and other criminal justice agencies and making the tackling of VAWG a national strategic priority would certainly go some way to reversing the impact of austerity. A decade of underfunding has brought the criminal court system to its knees, with fewer specialist policing units, a dismantled probation service, fewer support services for women, and significant reductions in legal aid. However, the comparison with the policing of terrorism may strike a chilling chord for black, Asian and minority women and men who have been adversely affected by the government’s Prevent strategy, aimed at identifying and disrupting potential recruits to terrorism, which has helped mainstream discrimination against them. Such cynicism about government intentions is further embedded by the discriminatory exclusion of migrant women from the protections offered in the recent domestic abuse bill, the attack on the right to public protest in the police, crime and sentencing bill, and the curtailing of routes to refugee status for women fleeing abuse under the nationality and borders bill. In October the home secretary, Priti Patel, announced a public inquiry into “issues raised by the conviction of Wayne Couzens”. This could be an opportunity to undertake a deep, searching analysis of institutionalised misogyny within policing. However, the government’s resistance to putting the inquiry on a statutory footing suggests the prime minister’s promise to “fix” things in the wake of Everard’s murder is not a serious one. So I am working with the backing of more than 21 national women’s organisations to formally bring judicial review proceedings against the home secretary, to ensure this inquiry is the robust investigation into police-perpetrated abuse and violence against women that is so desperately needed. So what does need to change if we are to begin to tackle the spectacular failings not only in policing, but across the criminal justice system? It is a question I am asked frequently. Instead of waiting for a public inquiry to provide answers, the CWJ has set out its own manifesto for change. The central principle of this manifesto is that women have a right to live free from the fear of male violence, which curtails our liberty and undermines our full participation in society. We do not propose new laws in our manifesto, but rather we ask for the urgent and effective implementation of the laws that already exist. We ask that those investigating and prosecuting crimes of violence against women, those who judge and sentence, and those who manage the risk of individuals convicted act with the united aim and understanding of how to prevent further violence. We want radical transformation of the investigation and prosecution of crimes of VAWG, an end to victim blaming, police-perpetrated abuse tackled, and an understanding of who represents risk, to ensure criminal justice interventions are directed at the perpetrators and not the victim. How might this work? Take the example of Effie (not her real name), a migrant woman we are advising, whose British partner – who had been physically and psychologically abusive towards her for months – called the police to their home, alleging she had physically injured him during an argument. At the time of this call, safeguarding concerns had already been raised by agencies, who recognised she was at high risk of harm from her partner. Yet instead of investigating who the “primary” perpetrator in the relationship was, the police arrested Effie and imposed strict bail conditions, which rendered her homeless and separated her from her breastfeeding child. She was convicted of assault, which we successfully appealed. In another example, a parole board considering the release of a man widely reported to have drugged and sexually assaulted more than 100 women might ask itself whether to accept his account that he no longer represented a threat. This is exactly what happened with the case of Worboys. His release after just 10 years in prison was only stopped after I submitted a judicial review challenge on behalf of two of his victims. Then there is the case of Sophie Moss, a vulnerable mother of two who died as a result of “prolonged” pressure to the neck at the hands of Sam Pybus. He was given just four years and eight months for manslaughter after the Crown Prosecution Service accepted his explanation that she “enjoyed erotic asphyxiation” (more commonly known as the “rough sex defence”, which is creeping in to murder cases). Under our manifesto, a prosecutor may have questioned the idea that Moss “enjoyed” being strangled during sex on the say so of the man who killed her and another man who had had sex with her; and should have put other evidence before a jury, for example from the father of Moss’s children, which disputed the assertion she liked to be strangled. Our manifesto recognises that all of this must happen within the framework of cultural change. As Mina Smallman – the mother of the two murdered sisters, Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, whose bodies were photographed and shared on a police WhatsApp group – said this week: “Those police officers felt so safe, so untouchable, that they felt they would take photographs with our murdered daughters.” She added: “There is more work to be done … we are part of the change that’s going to come in the culture of the police force.” Only when there is an understanding of the structural inequalities between men and women, and the intersecting forms of discrimination that make some groups of women more vulnerable based on race, class and disability, will real change occur. In the meantime, we will keep fighting.

12/13/2021,"Roff Smith’s photographs show a solitary cyclist – Smith himself – in a painterly landscape. His wheels appear to turn briskly, but really the bike moves as slowly as it can without a wobble. As a writer and photographer for National Geographic magazine, Smith, 63, visited more than 100 countries, but now he has squeezed the brakes and shrunk his world. His photographs are all taken within a 10-mile radius of his home, and yet travel has never felt so rich to him as it does now. Before the pandemic, he had already begun to feel jaded: air travel made “the world everywhere look the same”.  Then in March 2020 he returned from an assignment in Ecuador to St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, to join his wife and two children, who are 18 and 20. The world shut its doors behind him. Madrid went into lockdown hours after he passed through; England soon after he arrived. After decades of flights, “There was nowhere to go.” Instead, during lockdown, Smith took his camera, tripod and timer on bike rides locally. A distinctive style evolved in which he would ride slowly into his own frame, usually in “the blue hour” that precedes dawn. The images look serene, but making them was not. Smith had to master “the right body language, the bicycle language”, pick his outfits and time his entrance. “You can’t have your head disappearing in shadows. You’ve got to find yourself,” he says. It sounds like a spur to self-discovery, this practice of looking at an empty frame and imagining the space he would occupy. Does he see himself differently? “You become aware of how many shots have this sense of introspection, solitude,” he says. Smith has been a keen cyclist for as long as he can remember. Momentous rides have acted as milestones in his life. His father died when he was nine and he was raised by his mother. He was often alone for whole days, cycling from the family house in White Mountains in New Hampshire “to Bearcamp river, a fabulous distance away” at 12 miles, with its beaver ponds, forests and swamps. He was a voracious reader of books about explorers, and fancied himself on adventures too. “Even a bend in the road took on the quality of a chapter in a book. I thought, travelling the world is going to be as exciting as this.” National Geographic, to which he subscribed, thrilled him – especially a story of a bike trip along the Alaskan highway, which led him to write to the magazine, offering his services. He was only 17; they politely declined. At 22, he emigrated to Australia. He wanted to go “far, far, far away”. Was there something he wanted to escape? “I just felt like I needed to strike out on my own,” he says. As the mining reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald, he jetted around the gold mines of Australia. It wasn’t till he was 37 and recently divorced that Smith set off on his own epic ride “around Australia – a 10,000-mile solo trip”. It took him nine months, in the course of which he sold a series of his travels to National Geographic – “literally a childhood dream” – and, at a youth hostel in Perth, met his future wife. Although they moved to the UK and made a base together in St Leonards-on-Sea, Smith “jumped around a lot”, on assignment and also visiting his children from his first marriage in Australia. Although his movements have shrunk since the pandemic hit, his world has expanded. Just like those early trips to the Bearcamp river, “miles mean something” again. He cycles home “with a feeling that I have been places. I’ve seen the sun rise, listened to the aquatic life in the marsh or wildlife in the trees. I’ve got more of a sense of travel than if I were to hop on a plane.” He has not flown in nearly two years, and has no plans to do so. “It’s nice to be home,” he says. “But in a way it’s unsettling because you think, do I live here? In Europe?” He has American and Australian citizenship, but is really a citizen of his own two wheels: “I think I’m starting to identify with just being on my bike.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60: ‘I was a globetrotting photographer.

12/13/2021,"Polystyrene snow, MDF grottos, stomach-churning rides and Santas with scratchy fake beards: as Christmas nears, ’tis the season for winter wonderlands. At their best, these immersive Christmas markets and fairgrounds delight visitors of all ages, while providing a reliable source of income for their owners. Britain’s biggest winter wonderland, in Hyde Park, London, has pulled in more than 14 million people since it launched in 2005, with entry starting at £5 and attractions ranging from £5 to £15. But visitors to lesser attractions often complain of poorly thought-out productions and inexperienced organisers. Well-documented holiday horrors include Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen’s Birmingham attraction, which in 2014 was forced to shut down after a day following hundreds of complaints about cheap toys and long queues, and a New Forest Lapland whose owners were sentenced to 13 months in jail for misleading the public in 2008. “You told consumers that it would light up those who most loved Christmas,” the judge told them in his summing up. “You said you would go through the magical tunnel of light coming out in a winter wonderland. What you actually provided was something that looked like an averagely managed summer car boot sale.”  Punters may bear the full, wallet-emptying force of disappointment, but those working behind the scenes are often affected by poor conditions, low morale and inadequate or unpaid wages. We spoke to people who have worked at winter wonderlands over the years about their experiences and why many of them would never set foot in one again. Whether due to trauma or a lingering sense of guilt, almost all asked us not to use their real names Jack: I graduated in 2002 and, with no idea what to do next, I decided to stick around and look for temp work. I laughed very hard when I realised an agency was taking applications to be one of Santa’s elves and applied half-seriously. After a short phone interview, I got the job – I really could have been anyone off the street. The wonderland was at a massive conference centre, which seemed very impersonal. My main job was to welcome people in groups of 20 to 30, along with another elf. We had to act as if we were on a jet liner taking visitors to Lapland, with projected images of clouds behind us. We gave the families a speech to try to get the kids excited and then pretended the room was airborne. The whole thing was pretty embarrassing and ended after a few minutes with the “landing” and rows of blank faces staring back at us. Lucy: For a couple of years, while I was a student and needed the money, I worked as an elf at a winter wonderland in a shopping centre. It was horrendous – we were essentially employed just to make sure that people didn’t jump the queue or try to sneak in for free. Christmas is meant to be a time for happiness, but we only saw misery – exhausted parents, insane children and short tempers all round. We had to endure everything from being shouted at to being made fun of – once a colleague even had a drink thrown on them. The Santas had it great, though – they were paid more than us to endure a few minutes at a time dealing with excitable kids, before we ushered them all outside again to unwrap their disappointing presents. The whole thing was bleak. Jack: Sometimes I would also chaperone the kids to see Santa. But there were so many kids that we had 10 different Santas lined up together – if any of them still thought Santa was real, this made sure the fantasy fell apart. The whole experience was like being in a sausage factory, with a bell ringing every three minutes to bring a new group through. It was so dispiriting and fake and I was horrified to think how much families with four or five kids were spending. After a few weeks I realised I couldn’t be part of it any more and quit. I never made it to Christmas. Matt: If you are a man of a certain size and not averse to putting on a costume, Santa work is decent money each year. I’ve put in more than a decade doing stints and I really enjoy what I do; usually it brings the kids real excitement and it earns their parents some goodwill. But sometimes you have a nightmare job and it makes you question your life choices. A few years ago, I was booked by a pretty large winter wonderland just outside London. It was a couple of weeks of solid work and even though it was a new event, it seemed too good to pass up. As soon as I arrived, things started to go wrong. It was a few rides and a tent with a chair in the corner for me to sit on and see the kids, surrounded by a few reindeer that looked unhappy. Families began pouring in and there weren’t enough staff to deal with the chaos – the elves were struggling to keep the groups in line, while parents kept wandering off to find managers to shout at. It was such a tense atmosphere that a lot of the kids were coming to me already crying and there was no way we could make it any better for them – the illusion was ruined. After that first day, the person running the show was nowhere to be found. I never went back. I don’t think the place lasted a week and I was never paid. Tony: My business was hired to erect a tent for a winter wonderland at the Great Yorkshire Showground in Harrogate in 2014. It was a miserable operation – just half a fairground with a few reindeers. It was very tacky. Straightaway, people were complaining that they had been ripped off and, after two days, it was shut down for a “revamp”. We didn’t think it would reopen, so we went back to take the tent down and suddenly the fire doors to the grotto burst open and Santa came out in his full regalia, ripping off his white beard and shouting: “Fuck this – I’m not taking any more of youse! I’m off!” It was very funny and surreal. I don’t think the organiser was a crook – he was just totally out of his depth. A lot of these events are just fairgrounds with a bit of sparkle on the machines, but it takes a huge amount of effort to put on something good. Putting tinsel on your dodgems isn’t quite enough. Katie: I used to be a pretty good figure skater and the group I trained with would often get booked for Christmas performances. We would usually do a stint of themed winter wonderland gigs in full costume, which was welcome cash for the Christmas season. They would generally be pretty depressing shows, though, performing to half-empty tents on fake ice where we could often see members of the crowd walking out. One year, we were set to do a series of shows at a winter wonderland up north – we had our transport and accommodation booked and headed to the venue. When we got there, there was no one at the site – it was just a tent in a field. We called the organisers but they never picked up and we weren’t sure if we had got the dates or the place wrong. It was only when we searched on Facebook that we saw all the angry comments from customers saying it had been cancelled without any notice. They hadn’t even bothered to tell us, so we went straight home without even getting our skates on. Sarah: I was between jobs five years ago and decided to do some temping before I found something more permanent. That is how I ended up working at a historic house largely staffed by volunteers who all had a very strange attachment to the place. They treated it as if it was theirs to run and, as a consequence, they hated the manager whose job it was to actually look after it. One year, an events planner convinced the manager to put on a winter wonderland. The problem was, it is a centuries-old property and so can’t hold fairgrounds or attractions. The person who put on the event neglected to mention that to customers, though, and they were inevitably furious and disappointed. All they had were sweets and a few people dressed up – supposedly as Frozen characters, but the costumes were so cheap you couldn’t tell who they were. The volunteers also kept egging on the customers to complain so the manager would get into trouble. There had always been rumours that the place was haunted and I spent that day hiding from angry visitors with an old volunteer who was dressed up as Father Christmas. He used to say the spirits of the house spoke through him and when I went to lock up at night once everyone had left, I could swear the doorstops were moving in the dark. I didn’t last long after that – the volunteers would secretly hold seances, too, and it used to creep me out. Dan: I’ve worked security for years at all sorts of events and little compares to the experience of being at a winter wonderland with an alcohol licence. The combo of Christmas parties, pints and rides usually means that fights break out, as well as people throwing up and needing to be taken home. Once I saw a group of parents fighting because they thought one of the kids had pushed in front of the others in a queue. It is ridiculous – worse than some nightclubs. I just wish people had a bit more self-control. Rob: I’ve thrown many successful events in my career but none have been harder, or gone worse, than the winter wonderland I agreed to put on with an ex-friend of mine a few years ago. He had an agreement to put on a fair with a grotto and all the trimmings for a couple of weeks and called me in to help as a business partner. I don’t have many contacts in that area, so I called around and right from the off it was a total mess. Lots of the contractors we had agreed to use would either cancel at the last minute because they had better offers, or they would turn up and do a half-arsed job. Meanwhile, the tickets were selling very well. It was clear we weren’t going to be ready to open on the advertised date but greed got the better of my mate and so he let people arrive – inevitably bringing on an onslaught of complaints. We had no choice but to shut down a few days later because local papers were picking up the story and everyone was demanding their money back. Needless to say, it ruined our friendship and we made no money from the whole thing. I’ll never do an event like it again.

12/13/2021,"It can be a bit jarring when you catch yourself hooting at Alma’s Not Normal. A woman recalling a grim childhood she describes as being spent like “the baby in Trainspotting, if she’d lived” shouldn’t be funny … right? But creator Sophie Willan, who won a Bafta for the pilot of this show based on her own upbringing, has a razor-sharp wit – one that can find a punchline in any shitstorm. This unabashed sense of humour, along with authentic storytelling, is an invitation to acknowledge life’s lemons and laugh in the face of them. And that is how a series about a thirtysomething woman in Bolton brought up in care unravelled to be one of the most joyous comedy dramas of the year.  When we meet Alma – dressed in a bright faux-fur coat like a pink flamingo – her toxic boyfriend has just left her, she is desperate for work and she is navigating relationships with her addict mum Lin and her Tinder-swiping, Spam-loving grandma Joan (played to absolute perfection by Siobhan Finneran and Lorraine Ashbourne respectively). Luckily, Alma has a brilliant friend by her side: Leanne (Jayde Adams), who has “the mannerisms of a truck driver and the rock’n’roll sex appeal of Debbie Harry”. After they spend a night on the booze with kebabs and karaoke mics, it’s time for Alma to get her act together once and for all. The six-episode series saw her journey from getting a job as a sandwich artist to being offered a place on a local theatre tour, and making money as a sex worker in between. One week she was drinking champagne with “fabulous” client Phil, the next she was running away from a house with a stolen dog after a group of punters threaten her. And then there’s the heavy breathing client who is “like a pug that’s been on a long walk” during sex. “Why do people always psychoanalyse sex workers and question how empowered they are?” she asks Leanne, perhaps also challenging the viewer. “You don’t go to a telesales office and go: ‘Oh, Sue on the phones – is she empowered or is she loudly selling carpets because she was an only child?’” It’s a brilliant way of comically confronting life’s grey areas from a place of truth. As Alma works on rebuilding herself, she also examines her foundations, attempting to reconcile with her difficult childhood. This came to a head in the penultimate, and standout, episode in which she is sent a box of administrative records that were kept while she grew up in care. Her devastation over what is detailed in them comes out by shouting at an assistant in a 99p shop over a spatula that costs £1.29: “I’m being fucked, again!” But by the end of the episode, she’d turned it around, using her experience in care to help her bag an acting role. “You’re going to be more than fine; you’re going to be fucking fabulous, love,” she tells the little girl in her records, and yes – that is a tear in your eye. More serious ground is covered – observations on the welfare system, the reality of living with addiction – and it is mainly Alma’s fragile mum who threaded these issues throughout. After spending the whole series trying her hardest to rehouse Lin and ensure she doesn’t relapse, Alma spends the last episode deliberating whether she should put her stage dreams on hold. “Don’t give up now,” she tells her mother through the letterbox. “Crack and smack are not normal ways of blowing off steam, Mum.” It was heartbreaking, ugly, funny and real – an appropriately bittersweet finale of a brave series that celebrated the fabulously flawed.",Arts/Television & radio," The 50 best TV shows of 2021, No 8: Alma’s Not Normal",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/13/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2021-no-8-almas-not-normal
12/13/2021,"When the comic actor Slink Johnson was growing up in Arkansas, he had a specific image of Jesus Christ in his mind. “He was a white man with clean-ass robes,” he says. “Never a hair out of place. You had to be nice to him or his father’s gonna throw you in a lake of fire, you know what I mean?” Speaking over Zoom from his home in Los Angeles, where heavenly sunlight is streaming through the blinds behind him, he adds: “He was always holding his hands like this.” And he turns his palms upwards. None of which describes the version of the Son of God played by Johnson in the sitcom Black Jesus, which ran for three seasons between 2014 and 2019. Johnson’s Christ is an African American stoner chilling in his robes, sandals and crown of thorns in modern-day Compton. Despite a penchant for weed, he really is the Messiah, not a very naughty boy. He may scoff at requests for next week’s lottery numbers but he will happily use his divine power to help you find your keys (“Living room, couch, right pillow”). Anyone unhappy with their lot in life is reminded of the big man upstairs: “I told y’all, Pop’s got a plan.”  It may be one of the most unorthodox portrayals of Jesus but it is also among the sweetest. Vital to that is Johnson’s loving performance. “I wanna think he represents the best of me, minus some of my more worldly ways,” he says. Any controversy aroused by Black Jesus was mild, and could scarcely survive in the face of the show’s good-natured humour and optimism. “I think people were expecting it to be edgy or overly urban or ghetto,” says Johnson. “But it has this heartfelt warmth.” Then again, attitudes toward depictions of Christianity have softened since the furore surrounding Monty Python’s Life of Brian in 1979. Or, for that matter, Jesus Christ Superstar. Though that show is now accepted as a pillar of the musical theatre canon, its UK premiere in London in 1972 was greeted by protests, as its star Paul Nicholas remembers. “There were people outside the Palace theatre with placards,” he says. “To call something Jesus Christ Superstar was a bit dangerous. Things were quite touchy. It also had this radical, rocky score. Of course, once people saw the show, they could see it was all treated with great care.” The same is true of another interpretation of Jesus that caused even greater uproar: the one created and performed by the playwright Jo Clifford in The Gospel According to Jesus, Queen of Heaven. “I read the gospels and was incredibly moved by the figure of Jesus,” Clifford tells me. “Much to my surprise, I really admired him. I thought of the piece I was writing as an act of devotion. I imagined it wouldn’t attract the slightest bit of attention.” When she turned up in Glasgow in 2009 to perform her play, which takes the form of a sermon, she was faced instead with protesters objecting vociferously to a transgender woman playing the Son of God as a Daughter. Clifford’s play was informed partly by the hostility she had encountered since starting to live as a woman. “Every time I went out, people were laughing and pointing and shouting abuse. If you read the gospels, you see that Jesus is continually reaching out to people who are oppressed and suffering prejudice. The reason these demonstrators got so angry is that they believed I wanted to attack and defame Christian religion but that’s the opposite of where I was coming from.” In fact, her personal Jesus has created a fair few believers. “I’ve had people say, ‘If only church services had been like this when I was a child.’ Someone else said, ‘You never bloody told me you were going to make me a Christian!’” Among the converts was Clifford herself. “I wasn’t really a Christian before. My faith has come about through reading the gospels, making a play out of them and then, year after year, performing it.” How did she build Jesus as a character? “I couldn’t really tell you,” she laughs. “My children sometimes say, ‘You’re doing your Jesus voice!’ So I must have a Jesus voice, whatever that is. All I do on stage is say the words as truthfully as I can and with as much presence as possible.” Whether Jesus is portrayed as a stoner, a singer or a trans woman, there is a unifying Christ-like demeanour. That’s the view of James Burke-Dunsmore, who has played Jesus on hundreds of occasions, most notably as the star of the two-hour Passion play staged annually in Trafalgar Square. “It’s not about appearance,” he says. “I’ve directed other Jesuses, and they’ve been all sorts of shapes and sizes. But there’s a quality that comes from delivering the text without constantly forcing a point. The most successful Jesuses tend to hand over a teaching or a judgment expecting it to come back at them in a kind of to-and-fro. People want to receive the text unhindered by an actor’s ego or selfishness.” For Greg Barnett, who played the lead in the 2019 History Channel drama-documentary Jesus: His Life, becoming the Messiah entailed thinking of him purely as a man. “If I looked at the enormity of him being Jesus, it would have freaked me out,” he says. “I did get a review which described me as ‘physically unremarkable’, and at first I thought: ‘That hurts.’ But it was kind of what I was aiming for. I wanted to find that normality in him: just being a normal chap, with the human pain he went through.” With the exception of Black Jesus, humour in this context is often conspicuous by its absence, though Paul Nicholas did manage to amuse himself occasionally during his 10-month stint in Jesus Christ Superstar. “Doing it eight times a week, it does start to become a bit routine,” he admits. “And I could be a bit naughty sometimes. One night, I was waiting in the darkness to go on at the start of Act Two when a man in the audience sneezed. I whispered, ‘Bless you, my son.’ Very quietly, though, so that only the front row could hear!” Though the original 1972 production wasn’t filmed, a brief glimpse can be seen in that year’s Christmas special of the BBC sitcom Till Death Us Do Part, when Alf Garnett takes his family to see the show before accosting Nicholas in the bar afterwards to discuss the crucifixion. “Does it ’urt up there?” he asks, to which the actor replies: “Well, I’m glad when I get down.” Even for a non-believer like Nicholas, the crucifixion scene took its toll emotionally. “I would go below the stage and they would attach me to this very thin frame so that when I was raised up it looked like I was hanging in the air. The audience was very moved by that. All you could hear was the odd person sobbing. I was so overcome some nights that the tears started to flow. I felt so vulnerable up there, so exposed. It was a religious experience, in a sense, without me being religious. It affected me quite deeply.” Barnett felt the same while shooting his crucifixion scene in Morocco. “It was the most intense, insane experience to be hanging on the cross looking out at the Atlas Mountains, which were covered in snow,” he recalls. “It’s something I will never forget. I was on the cross for three days in total. On the last day, the sun was going down behind the mountains as they were lowering me, and I started sobbing uncontrollably. Everything was very peaceful; there was a real serenity on set. Afterwards it took me a good 45 minutes or so to decompress. It wasn’t negative in any way – it was weirdly cathartic.” For Nicholas, the role was ultimately still a job. “It’s always about acting and pretending,” he says. “I would leave Jesus at the stage door as I left each night.” But for Barnett, the part spilled over into his life. “I definitely had more time and love to give to other people. You’re living and breathing your character, so when it’s Jesus you can’t help but find yourself behaving like that.” Of course, it also looks good on the CV. “Absolutely. My mum loved it when I told her I’d got the part. We’d be out and she would say, ‘Ooh, can I introduce you to my son, Jesus?’ I’d be like, ‘All right, mother!’” As Johnson sees it, the lessons an actor takes away from the role are timeless. “It’s about everything we learned in kindergarten,” he says. “All the things we disregarded along the way: treat others how you wanna be treated, keep your hands to yourself, and be nice.”",Arts/Stage,"Jesus the stoner, the singer, the trans woman and the regular guy – actors on playing the Messiah",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/13/jesus-stoner-singer-trans-woman-regular-guy-actors-playing-messiah-son-god
12/13/2021,"The usually reliable and prolific Geminid meteor shower reaches its peak tonight. In the early hours of 14 December, one hundred or more meteors are expected to flash across the sky. Visibility this year is hampered by a waxing gibbous moon that is just four days away from being full. Yet, despite the moonlight, bright meteors should still be visible to the patient watcher.  From the UK, the moon sets around 0230 GMT, which is just in time for the expected peak of meteor shower activity. The chart shows the view looking high into the south western sky at 0300 GMT. The Geminids appear to radiate from a point close to the star Castor, which is next to Pollux in the constellation of Gemini, the twins. To stand the best chance of seeing meteors, look slightly away from the radiant and keep an eye open for their colour. While most will burn white, some shine yellow, red, green or blue. The shower is special because it originates from an asteroid rather than a comet. Most meteors are dust grains that were once part of a comet’s tail but the Geminids come from asteroid 3200 Phaethon. The meteor shower is also visible from the southern hemisphere.",News/Science,Starwatch: how to see the Geminid meteor shower ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/13/starwatch-how-to-see-the-geminid-meteor-shower
12/13/2021,"The family of the murdered private detective Daniel Morgan are to sue the Metropolitan police for damages, alleging that a decades-long cover-up of corruption is continuing. An official inquiry in June found that the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, obstructed the panel appointed by the government to investigate claims that corruption blighted the hunt for Morgan’s killers and that the Met had failed to root it out.  Morgan was found with an axe in his head in a south London pub car park in 1987. He and his business partner, Jonathan Rees, ran an agency called Southern Investigations, which carried out extensive work for the News of the World. No one has been convicted of his murder and the Met has previously accepted that corrupt officers shielded the killers. The Morgan family has decided to sue in part in frustration at what they see as a continuing cover-up. Despite the inquiry’s stark findings against Dick, the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (Mopac), the body that oversees the Met, decided she would not face disciplinary action. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is still to make a decision in relation to Dick and other Met officers past and present. The Morgan family’s solicitor, Raju Bhatt, said the civil claim alleged misfeasance in public office as well as breaches of the Human Rights Act. Dick would be named as a defendant, with the lawsuit alleging widespread wrongdoing as identified by the report. Bhatt said: “The claim alleges deliberate abuse or bad faith in the exercise of powers by any officer of the crown with knowledge or reckless indifference to the consequences of such conduct.” The claim dates back to 1987 and alleged wrongdoing immediately after the killing, when one suspect worked on the murder investigation, running through to recent years. Bhatt said: “The repeated failure over decades to confront … corruption includes the obstruction of the independent panel’s work and the response of the Met to that panel’s findings.” The Met rejected the findings of the panel, insisting it was not institutionally corrupt and that it had not obstructed its work. The panel blamed obstruction for its inquiry taking eight years as it fought for documents. Morgan’s brother Alastair has fought for more than 30 years and is exasperated that the inquiry findings have led to no action. In a statement, the Morgan family said: “The present commissioner, Cressida Dick, felt able to simply reject the panel’s key finding of institutional corruption within the Metropolitan police. Her role in obstructing the panel’s work – as detailed in their report – appears to have met with indifference and worse at the IOPC and Mopac where those charged with bringing her to answer for her role in this sorry state of affairs have shown themselves unable or unwilling to do so. “And, in their wisdom, the home secretary and the London mayor deemed it fit to extend her term in office before the ink had dried on the panel’s report. “We consider we have been left with no option but to bring a civil claim against the Metropolitan police in order to achieve some semblance of accountability. To that end, our solicitors have sent a letter of claim to the Metropolitan police directorate of legal services, and we await their response with interest.” The Met said it received notice of being sued last Tuesday. It said: “Since the Daniel Morgan independent panel published its report six months ago, a dedicated team within the Met has been established and is progressing its response to those recommendations specific to the Met, while engaging with other lead organisations named in the report. We remain committed to this work and expect to fully report our progress to the home secretary and mayoral office in spring 2022.” The IOPC said: “We are undertaking our own assessment to determine whether there are any conduct matters identified within the report for any named police officer, including the Metropolitan Police Service commissioner and former commissioners, that may require a referral to us.”",News/UK news,Family of murdered Daniel Morgan to sue Met for damages,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/13/family-of-murdered-daniel-morgan-to-sue-met-for-damages
12/13/2021,"Campaigners fear the roads agency in England is pushing ahead with plans to destroy or fill with concrete more than a dozen Victorian bridges despite a government pause after an outcry over “cultural vandalism”. When National Highways poured 1,000 tonnes of concrete and aggregate under a bridge at Great Musgrave in Cumbria, there was a backlash that forced ministers to halt the programme in July.  Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that despite the pause, the agency has spent tens of thousands of pounds on the sites. The agency says the work is part of routine maintenance but campaigners say it has the hallmarks of preparing for filling in or demolition. In one email concerning plans to demolish a former railway bridge near Bridport in Dorset, a National Highways civil engineer said the agency was continuing to work on the scheme. In the email, sent in August to Dorset council, the engineer said: “The government has halted all demolition and infill works for an indefinite period,” and added: “We are proceeding with all of background works as if it [the demolition] were continuing.” Demolition would scupper plans to reopen the Newton to Bridport branch rail line as a heritage attraction. The HRE Group, an alliance of engineers and sustainable transport advocates campaigning to reuse the historical railway network, obtained the documents. Graeme Bickerdike, a member of the group, said: “The awarding of these contracts demonstrates a clear direction of travel and undermines the ministers’ intervention. The so-called pause is just a smoke and mirrors.” A spokesperson for National Highways said its previous plans to demolish nine historical bridges and fill in a further 69 remained on pause. She said: “We cannot risk a delay to any safety critical work so we must be ready to proceed with any agreed work once the pause is lifted.” Hélène Rossiter, the head of its historical railways estate programme, said: “We have continued with vegetation and ecology work on a number of structures. This is good practice and will keep structures safe. This work will be required irrespective of any decisions regarding the future of these structures.” The documents show that between 21 September and 25 October the agency spent £192,000 on works around 13 of the 69 bridges earmarked for filling in before the pause and one of the nine bridges set for demolition. The work includes clearing vegetation around a bridge near Winchester that if filled in would block a planned 27-mile walking route; more than £55,000 of drainage works on two Gloucestershire bridges that are part of a proposed cycle route; filling cracks on a bridge in Barcombe, East Sussex, to stop bats roosting in the bridge’s brickwork; tree felling on the former Hull and Barnsley railway line at Little Smeaton, North Yorkshire; and drainage works at an ornate cast-iron bridge near Wakefield. Bickerdike said such work was inconsistent with routine maintenance. He said: “You don’t fell mature trees 15 metres from a bridge if you’re not intending to infill it and form embankments. You don’t spend tens of thousands of pounds on drainage work under a bridge unless you intend to carry out a bigger scheme. And you don’t block up cracks to prevent bats roosting in a structure unless you intend to undertake works imminently.” He pointed out that National Highways spent £14,000 on works to the bridge at Barcombe after it awarded a £246,000 contract to fill in the bridge. He said the demolition or blocking of Victorian bridges ran counter to the government’s strategy to promote walking and cycling in part by encouraging the use of disused railway lines. The strategy set out in July in a document called Gear Change acknowledged: “There has been concern about the fate of a small proportion of the 3,250 railway structures managed by Highways England [since renamed National Highways].” It promised to review plans if there was a realistic prospect of disused lines being used for walking, cycle routes or heritage railway lines, and to consult local people. It added: “Until then, any infilling or demolition on these structures will be paused unless there is an immediate need to act on grounds of public safety.” Meanwhile, National Highways is preparing to submit retrospective planning permission for filling in the bridge at Great Musgrave after it was decried as “cultural vandalism” during a debate in the House of Lords. If planning is refused, the concrete will have to be removed.",Arts/Culture,Fears of more ‘cultural vandalism’ of Victorian bridges in England,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/13/fears-of-more-cultural-vandalism-of-victorian-bridges-in-england
12/13/2021,"Companies that received taxpayer-backed loans to help them survive the pandemic continued to donate tens of thousands of pounds to the Conservative party, the Guardian can disclose. While there is no evidence the low-interest loans were used to fund donations directly, critics say there was no justification for companies requesting taxpayer help during the pandemic and then continuing to make political contributions.  One campaign group said it “smells like state funding of a political party” and called on businesses that made donations to compensate the Treasury. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) in March 2020, offering emergency loans of up to £5m to small businesses hit by Covid-19. Loans have been made to more than 100,000 firms. While the loans are arranged and made by banks, the government guarantees them and also pays the first year’s interest and loan fees. These elements of the £27bn CBILS scheme constitute state aid, according to the government and the European Commission. Analysis by the Guardian of the state aid disclosures published by the commission shows that several firms that were already Conservative donors continued contributing to the party after receiving taxpayer-backed loans. Dow Investments, a property firm founded by the Scottish entrepreneur and philanthropist Robert Kilgour, received a CBILS loan of £1m in August 2020, of which the state aid element amounted to £106,798. After receiving the loan, the company continued making monthly payments to the Conservatives, with a combined value of £37,494. Kilgour sits on the advisory council of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, an influential rightwing thinktank that rose to prominence campaigning for cuts in public sector spending. Approached for comment, he said the loan was “fully secured against its property assets as an extra financial reserve against the slings and arrows of the very severe business effects of the pandemic”. Calling it a “very prudent move”, he added: “Dow Investments currently plans to repay the full CBILS loan in early 2022.” Kilgour said Dow’s subsidiary Renaissance Care, a nursing home business, was a private company providing a predominantly public service, because 67% of its elderly residents were local authority clients. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) also guaranteed a loan of £1.5m to the aerospace parts business Orange Aero, of which £162,425 was classified as state aid. After receiving the loan in August 2020, Orange Aero donated £50,000 to the Conservative party in October of the same year. Orange Aero’s managing director, Simon Jeffs, said there was no link between the loans it received and the company’s subsequent political donation. “Our business has been decimated and we have had to be extremely agile and reinvent ourselves to focus on other areas of the aerospace business,” he said. “The CBILS loan was outstanding support but we also had an outstanding year in 2018 and retained in the business the profits we made.” He said the loans were made by banks and would be fully repaid, adding that the company’s political donations were “modest”. The Norwich-based construction company Bateman Groundworks took a loan of £1.8m in August 2020, including a state aid portion worth £186,120. That same month it donated £4,500 to the local MP Brandon Lewis, followed by donations of £6,000 and £12,000. Its managing director, Richard Bateman, said the loan was “fully guaranteed and secured against both company and personal assets” and said this meant it was “not a taxpayer-backed loan”. “The loan was in no way used to fund the Conservative party generally or any individual member of the party,” he said. Another company that received a CBILS loan was Stonehaven Campaigns, a public relations and consultancy business set up by the former Scottish Conservatives rising star Peter Lyburn. The company received a £500,000 loan in April 2020, with the state aid component reaching £47,100. It has donated £1,250 to the Conservative party every month since then, to a value of £15,000. Stonehaven Campaigns declined to comment on the record, but the company made clear any loans it received did not fund outgoings on donations. Tom Brake, the director of the pressure group Unlock Democracy, said: “There can be no justification for a business, in receipt of financial support during the Covid pandemic, to continue donating to party funds. “To suggest that somehow donations are completely separate from a company’s overall income is disingenuous. This looks and smells like state funding of a political party – something you’d expect the government to oppose ideologically. The government should be requesting that these businesses repay an equivalent amount to the Treasury.” A government spokesperson said the loans “provided a lifeline to millions of businesses across the UK – helping them survive the pandemic and protecting millions of jobs. We have always been clear that these are loans, not grants. In every case, lending decisions were made by lenders in a process that is completely separate from government and there are strict guidelines which set out how the funds from these loans should be used.” While the decision to lend under the scheme rests with banks, the government guarantees the loan, with 8% of its value deemed to be state aid. The taxpayer also picks up the cost of interest and loan fees for the first year. Asked if taxpayer money had been indirectly used to fund the Conservative party, the party did not return requests for comment.",News/Politics,UK firms taking taxpayer-backed Covid loans continued donations to Tory party,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/13/uk-firms-taking-taxpayer-backed-covid-loans-continued-donations-to-tory-party
12/13/2021,"The national rollout of an app to help Australians better sort their recycling has received a lukewarm reception as critics warn it won’t help solve fundamental problems with the industry. Recycle Mate is a free to access app by developer DreamWalk that has been available in an earlier form in New South Wales since 2019.  The app uses artificial intelligence and photo recognition so a person can take a photo of an item with their phone to find out whether it can be recycled, wherever they are. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said in a statement the $2m app will help drive down the amount of plastic that goes to landfill. “Every time a photo is uploaded to the app, it recognises more and gets smarter, meaning less confusion for users,” Ley said. “The beauty of this app lies in its simplicity – anyone can use it – but ultimately the outcome will be less contamination of recyclable products in recycling bins, a larger volume of recoverable items heading to resource recovery centres and less waste in landfill.” Jeff Angel, director at recycling coalition Boomerang Alliance, said the app would help “get the right products into the right bin”, but that this focus on educating consumers misunderstood the recycling problem. “The traditional approach of government and industry has been to put all the obligation on the consumer,” Angel said. “But without government and industry being obliged to use that material for recycled content for new products, they are largely escaping their responsibilities.” A recent progress report from the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (Apco) found Australia was failing to meet its own plastic reduction targets, with just 16% of plastic packaging being recycled in 2020, despite more than half of it being easily recyclable. Australia has set a target for 70% of plastic packaging to be recycled or composted by 2025, and for unnecessary single-use plastic packaging to be phased out. But the Apco report found that with the current recycling upgrades in place, Australia will only be able to recycle 36% of plastics annually by 2025. The Australian Marine Conservation society plastics expert Shane Cucow said “people are rightfully frustrated” because despite them doing the right thing Australia’s recycling industry was “never capable of dealing with the plastic packaging that’s being pushed on people”. “Unless we deal with the root cause here, which is too much plastic packaging being produced and not enough facilities to process it, people’s recycling efforts are never going to be enough,” Cucow said. Some critics also raised questions about the Recycle Mate app’s privacy policy. Justin Warren, chair of internet user protection group Electronic Frontiers Australia, said the app’s privacy policy “links to a fairly generic website privacy policy that doesn’t mention how your personal data, like your location, is handled”. “What happens to the images you take is buried in the terms and conditions on the app and I doubt most people will bother to read them,” Warren said. “Depending on what people take photos of, and what might be in the background, there are some risks there.”",News/Environment,Recycle Mate: critics say rollout of AI sorting app won’t solve Australia’s waste problem,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/13/recycle-mate-critics-say-rollout-of-ai-sorting-app-wont-solve-australias-waste-problem
