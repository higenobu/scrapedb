4/30/2022,"Full disclosure: I did not love Jerusalem the first time around. Jez Butterworth’s play about myths and Englishness has itself been so mythologised since that original 2009 run – hailed as the play of the century and celebrated for its Shakespearean qualities – that it seems like heresy to speak of ambivalence in anything other than a whisper. Butterworth’s language contains great riches and Johnny “Rooster” Byron, the play’s outsider, antihero, rebel and messiah rolled into one, is a blazing creation. But what about the peculiarly flat, Little Britain-style humour of the first act? The peripheral female characters and queasy pejoratives of women? And its harking back to a bygone England – a “holy land” filled with ancient energies, druids and Stonehenge giants – that carries the discomforting idea that Englishness was a better, purer version of itself then? This production brings back some of the players from the original, including the director Ian Rickson as well as Mark Rylance’s Rooster and Mackenzie Crook’s Ginger (an out-of-work plasterer who reckons himself a DJ), and it revives, for me, some of the same gripes. Its motley crew of “outcasts, leeches, undesirables [and] beggars” who meet around Rooster’s caravan in an illegally occupied spot of Wiltshire woodland to drink and snort coke still look like comic grotesques in its first act. Now, we wonder if they are Brexiters and populists in the making – the deplorables and left-behinds they might be labelled today. “I leave Wiltshire and my ears pop,” says one character who does not see the point of other countries. Maybe if this play had been revived before the EU referendum, the metropolitan masses would not have been as shocked by the result. First staged two years after the demise of Blair’s Britain, its references to Chumbawamba, Sex and the City, Bin Laden and the Spice Girls sound dated, giving it a wavering sense of a play located in the recent past, glancing back at the ancient past. Its language predates #MeToo and Black Lives Matter – and it shows. There is a limp joke about dressing up in a burqa, another about Nigerian traffic wardens. There are references to women as “slappers”, “bitches” and fat wives. Byron boasts of his conquests and talks of pinching bums, while Ginger states: “I don’t actually have GCSE maths but I do have a great big hairy cock and balls.” Bizarrely, this gets some laughs on opening night. These are brief references but they feel repetitive and othering. It does not help that the few female characters are marginal, including Rooster’s ex-partner, Dawn (Indra Ové), who is given some good lines, but isn’t on stage for very long. Where several male characters are fleshed out later on, the women stay flat. But the tone of this production is not set in the first, peculiar act, and the play is not the sum total of its anachronisms, either. Although the bigger ideological issues around women and Englishness continue to run through the three acts, this is a complicated and layered play, growing into its magnificence, as mercurial as its contradictory and complicated central character. From the second act onwards, it expands into an ever more tense, mysterious and majestic drama, enormous in its sense of tragedy. Much of this is down to Rylance’s epic performance, as physical as it is psychologically profound. If Rooster starts out as a brute, limping around from a history of drunken violence, Rylance captures the wreckage of that man immaculately, from his gait to hangover headache and comedown of jittery, darting eyeballs. The play takes place on St George’s Day, at the woodland spot being illegally occupied by Rooster as he is about to be evicted, though he continues to protest against the council and the new housing development nearby. He is both a heroic anti-establishment rebel and one of society’s losers; an immortal daredevil (he claims to have risen from the dead and speaks of the alchemical properties of “Byron” blood) and a deluded bum or “supertramp”, as Dawn calls him mockingly, and a bad father to boot. His character grows in power, bigger until he seems almost as big as one of the mythological giants he claims to have spoken to near Stonehenge. But more tragic, too – betrayed, alone, vilified, and yet making his stand, broken but still defiant. The play’s ideas around myth and identity are lyrical but do not fully cohere. Ultz’s astonishing set opens up to bacchanalian detritus outside Rooster’s caravan – empty bottles, a mucky sofa, a disco ball tied to a tree and even live chickens. But it is uncomfortable to see the St George’s Cross emblazoned on the curtain at the start and then a flag hung around the back of the caravan. That flag has, since Jerusalem’s first staging in 2009, continued to be associated with the far right, and the play’s bigger dewy-eyed ideas around Englishness carry a queasy proximity to the romanticised narrative that has been co-opted by the right. But any disagreement around the treatment of its themes cannot take away from its drama and the soaring central performance. Is it the greatest play of our times? Not in my view. But Rylance’s Rooster is surely the greatest performance of the century.

4/30/2022,"A mother has been jailed for causing her 11-month-old daughter’s death while keeping her in squalid conditions “surrounded by walls covered in faeces”, according to police. Nafahat Jamal died of a chest infection after weeks of neglect at the hands of Fartun Jamal at her flat in Brent Park, London. The 25-year-old made a series of web searches including “I can’t cope with my child anymore” and “I want to give up my child” in early 2019, jurors were told during a trial at Harrow crown court. She knew Nafahat was unwell with a “very high temperature” and had a poor appetite but failed to take her to a doctor, the court heard. Visitors in the weeks leading up to the baby’s death recalled her cot was broken and the flat in Kingfisher Way was full of takeaway boxes, dirty plates and nappies. On 22 February, social services attended the property after concerns were raised by a babysitter. However, they warned Jamal ahead of their visit and when they arrived they found the flat was clean and the situation had improved. A second social services visit, without prior warning, was planned for 13 March, the day Nafahat died. When paramedics were called to the property by a neighbour at 12.24pm, Jamal told them she had found her daughter’s body after having a dream that the baby had “stopped breathing”. Jamal was charged with one count of causing Nafahat’s death by neglect, two counts of child cruelty in relation to her daughter and a third count of child cruelty in relation to another child. Last month a jury found her guilty of all four counts after deliberating for nearly nine hours. Jamal was jailed for five years and six months at Harrow crown court on Friday, Scotland Yard said. DCI Madeline Ryder, the Met’s senior investigating officer, said Jamal went out partying just days before Nafahat’s death and “had clearly placed her social life above that of the basic needs of her baby”. He added: “This is an absolutely tragic case that resulted in the needless death of an innocent baby. “She died of an illness that was very treatable if Jamal had bothered to seek medical attention. “What is even more harrowing is that her GP’s surgery was less than 70 metres away from where she died and could be seen from Nafahat’s bedroom window, so help was within very easy reach.”",News/UK news,Mother jailed for causing death of baby daughter in London flat,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/30/mother-jailed-for-causing-death-of-baby-daughter-in-london-flat
4/30/2022,"The Metropolitan police is seeking a further attempt to challenge the high court’s ruling that officers breached the rights of organisers of a vigil for Sarah Everard last year. High court judges earlier this month refused the Met permission to appeal against its ruling in March about the force’s handling of the planned event. However, Scotland Yard said on Friday that it is now seeking permission from the court of appeal to challenge the high court decision. The campaign group Reclaim These Streets (RTS), which organised the event in March 2021 in south London, criticised the force, tweeting: “We can now announce that @metpoliceuk are spending more taxpayer money to continue to fight us in court. “Despite the High Court’s vehement rejection of their ‘hopeless’ application for permission to appeal, they are now trying to appeal to the Court of Appeal. “Will it never end?” Responding to RTS’s tweet, the Met Police said its appeal is not focused on the policing of the vigil itself, but decisions and communications with RTS ahead of the event. The force said: “The reason we’re appealing this case is that we believe there are important points of principle around the role of police in advising organisers ahead of a proposed event and whether that should involve an assessment of the importance of the cause. “We believe that clarity around these issues is of the utmost importance both for citizens and their right to free expression, and for the police in how they enforce legal restrictions while remaining neutral to the cause behind the event itself.” RTS initially proposed a socially distanced vigil for Everard, 33, who was murdered by serving Met officer Wayne Couzens near to where she went missing in Clapham, south London, in March last year. The four women who founded RTS and planned the vigil brought a legal challenge against the force over its handling of the event, which was also intended to be a protest about violence against women. RTS withdrew from organising the vigil after being told by the force they would face fines of £10,000 each and possible prosecution if the event went ahead. However, a spontaneous vigil and protest took place instead, attended by hundreds of people led by the direct action group Sisters Uncut. It culminated in clashes between officers and protesters and accusations of heavy-handed policing. The RTS founders, Jessica Leigh, Anna Birley, Henna Shah and Jamie Klingler, argued that decisions made by the force in advance of the planned vigil amounted to a breach of their human rights to freedom of speech and assembly, and said the force did not assess the potential risk to public health. In a ruling in March, their claim was upheld by Lord Justice Warby and Mr Justice Holgate, who found that the Met’s decisions in the run-up to the event were “not in accordance with the law”. After considering an application on paper – without a hearing – by the Met to challenge the ruling at the court of appeal, the judges refused permission. However, the force is now asking the court of appeal itself to grant permission to challenge the ruling.",News/UK news,Met seeks further bid to challenge high court ruling on Sarah Everard vigil,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/29/met-seeks-further-bid-to-challenge-high-court-ruling-over-sarah-everard-vigil
4/30/2022,"Jürgen Klopp believes he has only started creating a legacy at Liverpool and his new contract offers certainty to any player considering their future at “the perfect place”. The Liverpool manager extended his Anfield career until 2026 on Thursday and has urged his quadruple-chasing team to “squeeze everything out of the season” with five matches remaining in the Premier League title race, an FA Cup final and a possible third Champions League final appearance in five campaigns to come. Irrespective of how the season ends, however, Klopp insists the next four years can yield even greater rewards for Liverpool than he has accomplished thus far. “I really think it’s a good place to be or a good place to join, if not the perfect place,” he said of his decision to extend. “The world is in a difficult situation; it’s not only coronavirus, it’s Ukraine, it’s so many things, and then on a less important level big clubs have problems here and there with money and these kind of things. “We want to offer emotion, we want to deliver excitement, we want to be together with our people, we want to really be connected and we want to be special as well as a club. We sit here now and in 20 years’ time we will look back and for all of us it’s about creating stories which we will remember easily and think: ‘Wow, that was good.’ “But we have to do that now – we cannot wait 10 years. I’ve already been here for a while, and this isn’t a contract where you have a look and go: ‘This is really nice, let’s stay here for ever because the people like us.’ Internally with the coaching staff, it’s really like this [that we have to achieve now]. It’s no threat. This is only the start. That’s the plan, that we really, really go for it. There are no guarantees in our sport, and that’s why we have to enjoy the journey.” Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino are out of contract in 2023 and, despite protracted negotiations, Liverpool have been unable to agree an extension with the Egypt international. With his side preparing to visit Newcastle on Saturday lunchtime, Klopp was asked whether his new contract would persuade others to follow suit, and replied: “That is more a question for the boys, but my relationship with them is great … I think everything is clear in this moment. If that is a positive sign for the boys, great, but I don’t think this will be the one decisive thing for whatever decision they want to make. It is their own life but we just wanted to guarantee that everyone who wants to be here knows what he can expect.” Klopp has insisted he would never stand in the way of Pepijn Lijnders’ managerial ambitions, after his assistant put them on hold to also sign up for another four years at Liverpool. “I know Pep will be an outstanding manager in the future,” he said. “He is not even 40 yet so there is a long time after all this to be by yourself. At the moment we all enjoy the work here together. His own ambitions will never stop and I will never stop it.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp declares Liverpool ‘perfect place’ for players to play,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/jurgen-klopp-declares-liverpool-perfect-place-players
4/30/2022,"Antonio Conte has reacted angrily to the suggestion that he has offered his services to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer, with the French club expected to sack Mauricio Pochettino, describing it as a lie, fake news and unfair to everybody. The Tottenham manager’s focus is on nothing other than his club’s final five matches of the Premier League season – the first is Leicester at home on Sunday – and giving everything to secure a Champions League finish. And yet the obsession continues to carry a sting. Conte could very easily kill all rumours about his future by promising to remain at Spurs next season. He will not do so. Conte doubled down hard on his position on Friday, maintaining that he would discuss next season with the club’s hierarchy only after the current campaign had ended. There was also the habitual reminder that he wanted to assemble a squad which could do more than battle for the top four. “Obviously, I think it’s good that other clubs appreciate my work,” Conte said, when asked about the PSG link. “But the truth is that I don’t like when people try to invent news – only to speak, only to create problems. This is not right. Not fair for me, for the clubs involved and for my players. The people that want to tell something about this have to show respect for all the people involved in this situation and not invent fakenews and tell a lot of lies. “In this moment, in our minds, me, the club and the players have to be focused on the last five games. I said to you a lot of times, at the end of the season, we speak with the club but with pleasure, in a really good way – to find the best solution for everybody. “Don’t forget I like to have ambition, not only to fight for a place in Champions League or a place in Uefa [Europa] League. Honestly, I want to fight for much more, you understand? I deserve to do this – to fight for and win trophies, to fight for something important, not for only sixth or seventh, eight place or, if you have a fantastic season, fourth place.” Conte was asked to clarify what he meant by the best solution. “It will be very important to understand how much time we need to fight for something important – if we have the patience to wait because, for sure, this is a process,” Conte replied. “I always say to you that we need time and patience. And we have to understand how much time we need and how much patience we have. “We have to understand if we can match my opinion and [the] club opinion. We are trying do this season in the best possible way and then we will see. I am enjoying it a lot in Tottenham. For this reason, we will have a private meeting and we will try to find the best solution.”",Sport/Football,Conte dismisses ‘fake’ PSG link but keeps Spurs hanging over his future,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/conte-dismisses-fake-psg-link-but-keeps-spurs-hanging-over-his-future
4/30/2022,"Hostile foreign states and others pose a “real risk” of gaining access and wielding influence through all-party parliamentary groups (APPGs), the Commons standards committee has warned. Calling for reforms to avert what it described as the “next great parliamentary scandal”, the committee also voiced concerns that a dramatic rise in the number of the informal cross-party groups also risks “inappropriate influence and access” because they are so difficult to monitor. The cautions come after an unprecedented security warning from MI5, circulated to MPs and peers earlier this year, that accused a lawyer of seeking to improperly influence parliamentarians on behalf of China’s ruling Communist party. Barry Gardiner had received more than £500,000 in donations from Christine Lee before the alert was issued. Giving private evidence to the report, the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, said that indiscriminate engagement with state actors who may be hostile to UK interests did not take adequate account of the potential security risks to parliament. “I worry that we are not joining up our security and the threats that we have,” said Hoyle, in his oral evidence for the report published on Saturday. “These people are not our friends. “Some are our friends, but they have intentions and objectives, which worries me. If we are not careful, the security implication for the opening up of parliament is very, very worrying.” The report – titled All-Party Parliamentary Groups: improving governance and regulation – comes after an investigation earlier this year, by the Guardian and Open Democracy, found that more than £13m has been poured into a growing network of MPs’ interest groups by private firms including healthcare bodies, arms companies and tech companies, fuelling concerns over the potential for backdoor influence. The report states that “improper access” by paid lobbyists seeking to wield influence through APPGs was a risk that had been identified as far back as 2013, but that increased transparency introduced since has not mitigated the risk in the way it had been hoped. The threat from hostile overseas states seeking to wield influence discreetly through APPGs was one that had only developed in recent years, added the MPs behind the report. They said they had been persuaded by Hoyle’s evidence that this was “a very real risk, which needs addressing with some urgency”. APPGs are informal groups representing MPs’ and peers’ interests, from China and Russia to cancer, digital regulation, longevity and jazz. They must be chaired by MPs, but are often run or funded by lobbyists and corporate donors seeking to influence government policy. The standards committee concluded in their report: “We are concerned that if left unchecked, APPGs could represent the next great parliamentary scandal, with commercial entities effectively buying access to and influence of parliamentarians and decision-makers.” The MPs behind the report said Commons authorities should “provide more significant support” to help parliamentarians scrutinise the benefits being offered by foreign governments. Funding should be made more transparent, while the number of APPGs must be reduced from the current number of 744, the standards committee recommended. Regulatory enforcement was also advised, as was limits on secretariats of the groups to “reduce the risk of improper access”. Standards committee chair, Chris Bryant, said APPGs “must never be a backdoor means of peddling influence around the corridors of power or pursuing a commercial interest”. “[This] report represents a wake-up call for us all,” the Labour MP said. “The evidence we have gathered is chilling and points towards an urgent need for the house to take action.” In a statement at the time, Gardiner said he had been “liaising with our security services for a number of years about Christine Lee” and that he had been “assured by the security services that while they have definitively identified improper funding channelled through Christine Lee, this does not relate to any funding received by my office.”",News/UK news,Hostile foreign states pose ‘real risk’ of influencing MPs groups,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/29/hostile-foreign-states-pose-real-risk-of-influencing-mps-groups
4/30/2022,"Frank Lampard has no intention of quitting Everton even if the club suffer a first relegation since 1951. Everton have six games to save their Premier League status, starting with the visit of Lampard’s former club Chelsea on Sunday, and would be five points adrift of Burnley by kick-off if their relegation rivals win at Watford. The Everton manager remains focused on survival, and therefore reluctant to consider or discuss the possibility of relegation, but confirmed he intended to remain in the job beyond this season. “I am very committed,” said Lampard, who succeeded Rafael Benítez on 31 January. “I really don’t want to get into the headlines, or ins and outs of that, but absolutely [I am committed].” Asked whether he would manage an Everton team in the Championship, Lampard replied: “I don’t want to get drawn on that question but what I will say is I have loved every minute of being at this club. Sometimes people from the outside ask me, because of the position we are in: ‘Are you enjoying it, with all the pressures of it?’ I absolutely love it. “I have been welcomed incredibly well by the fans and supported by them and I will do everything to get this club back to where I want it to be. I’m not going to jump into the future because it’s not worth it but, in terms of my dedication to this job, I will give it absolutely everything for as long as Everton want me here and I can get them to where I think we can get to.” The Everton manager has defended Anthony Gordon after fierce criticism of the 21-year-old’s performance against Liverpool last weekend, when he was booked for diving and had a strong penalty appeal denied by the referee Stuart Attwell. Lampard said: “I don’t think it is the case [that Gordon goes to ground easily]. I think Anthony’s booking was the first in his senior career for simulation. If you look at attacking players in the league, fast players who change direction quickly and then the defender sticks their leg out and makes contact, I think you could find many clips that look similar. “Whether it’s a penalty or not – I’m not going to sit here and say it’s stonewall – but there is definitely contact. The second half one is a penalty in my firm opinion, although it won’t be everyone’s opinion. Anthony was ahead of the defender [Joël Matip], the defender stepped on his foot and gave him a push. “I think it’s unfair to put that on Anthony. Anthony is a great kid.

4/30/2022,"Pep Guardiola has laughed off Jürgen Klopp’s and Liverpool’s complaints about their schedule this week by saying if he allowed Manchester City’s fixture timetable to affect him he would go and manage in the Maldives. Klopp is unhappy that after facing Villarreal on Wednesday in the Champions League his team travel to Newcastle for Saturday’s early kick-off. This moved his club to try to change the time of the match. When Guardiola was asked how he viewed the German’s remarks, his initial answer had a cutting tone. “Always I sympathise about the concerns of Liverpool,” he said. “How many times have we discussed what’s happened to us and I’ve said I don’t want to talk about that. It’s not going to change because the broadcasters are thinking about what they have to do to get more viewers. “Of course I understand it but what can I say? Sir Alex Ferguson was the most important icon in the history of English football and he was complaining [about this] when he was a teenager. We played in Madrid against Atlético and three days later we played at Wembley in an FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool. Chelsea played Tuesday [of that week] and could have played on Saturday but played on Sunday [in the other semi-final]. Do you think they [broadcasters] think about that? No, because the next Tuesday, Liverpool play against United. Everyone has their own business to defend. We adapt. “If I’m not satisfied I go home and don’t be manager of Man City. I go to another league in the Maldives, and play one game a week and I’m so comfortable under the coconuts. But it’s not the case. You are playing at 12.30 – I’m sorry, Liverpool, but I’m not involved with that.” Guardiola offered a quip when asked whether there was disappointment that Mohamed Salah was voted the Football Writers’ men’s player of the year instead of Kevin De Bruyne. “Congrats to Salah,” he said. “Jürgen says they have the best keeper, defender, midfielder, strikers so it’s normal for them to win the award,” Klopp has said that Alisson is the best No 1 and his deputy, Caoimhín Kelleher, the finest No 2. City are at Leeds later on Saturday, knowing if they win there and their final four matches they retain the title. Guardiola has no concern regarding his players feeling the pressure. “They have been here many times,” he said. “These players, I know them.” John Stones and Kyle Walker remain injured.",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola gives short shrift to Liverpool’s fixture complaints,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/pep-guardiola-gives-short-shrift-to-liverpools-fixture-complaints
4/30/2022,"The stakes were high, and happily for those who witnessed the Premiership’s latest end-to-end thriller, so was the level of entertainment. Harlequins demonstrated their endless fighting spirit before James Grayson’s long-range 77th-minute penalty edged Saints past the champions and secured a fifth consecutive league win. Northampton must still play Saracens and Newcastle, and are building what appears to be unstoppable momentum. Marshalled superbly by their scrum-half, Alex Mitchell, the Saints attack was irresistible, despite losing three of their starting pack to injury before half-time. Their lines of running and joined-up approach threatened to overwhelm Quins before Tabai Matson’s side battled back into the lead after the break, and into position for the win that would have secured a playoff spot. But the Saints go marching on. “I think it was a gutsy effort by the whole team but the pack particularly,” said the Northampton director of rugby, Chris Boyd. “For them to hang in there and stay connected for long enough to get some territory, force a penalty, and sneak over the top, it was a pretty decent effort.” On a clear, dry evening and on a pristine pitch it had not taken long for the home side to demonstrate their intent. A wonderful tip-on by Grayson helped to create the first five-pointer, making space for a razor-sharp pass by Mitchell to release Lewis Ludlam, who chucked the ball inside for Tommy Freeman to sprint over. Mitchell’s speed of service was doing damage and his rampaging run to the left was interrupted only by a try-saving tackle by his opposite number, Danny Care. The Saints prop Conor Carey was taken off on a stretcher after going down injured in the same move, after Northampton had already lost their No 8 Juarno Augustus to injury. Neither setback did anything to deter the hosts: Ludlam soon snuck over for their second try after the ball was again sent fizzing through hands. Marcus Smith clipped a penalty over to bring the visitors within four and at the other end, Matt Proctor slipped spectacularly after being wrong-footed by a bouncing cross kick. Paul Hill, who came off the bench for Carey minutes before, took a blow to the head from Courtney Lawes; Hill went off and the referee, Matthew Carley, switched to uncontested scrums. George Furbank soon stretched a hand for the line for Northampton’s third try. The home team led by nine and only a crunching hit by Furbank stopped Andre Esterhuizen from tearing over the try-line, but a cute cross-kick by Smith saw Joe Marchant pull off an outrageous leap, catch and pass inside for Huw Jones, the full-back, who streaked under the posts. It was a glorious piece of skill by Marchant that survived a TMO check for a foot in touch. Perhaps fans of the darker arts did not appreciate it, but few of those present seemed to mind about the uncontested scrums. Northampton smashed over for their fourth, bonus-point try from Alex Waller inside the final five minutes of the half after a couple of a crushing carries by Ludlam. Saints seemed set fair but it was Quins that roared out of the second-half blocks. Alex Dombrandt celebrated his 25th birthday by picking an excellent line to crash over for their third try and when Cadan Murley sped over for their own bonus-point try and Smith converted, Quins hit the front. An ill-judged high hit by Santiago Garcia Botta on Furbank saw Carley produce a yellow card and Quins competed impressively to maintain their advantage until the Argentinian prop returned. With two points in it and 10 minutes remaining, it was impossible to imagine an undramatic conclusion. A couple of Saints’ turnovers felt significant: and when the Quins replacement Luke Wallace was penalised, Grayson nervelessly nailed the penalty, and the Franklin’s Gardens crowd went wild. Matson said: “With two minutes to go and you’re in front, you think: jeez, we could sneak away here. But that’s the great thing about the game, isn’t it? I just saw Boydy, who’s an old friend of mine, and we can sit back and go: “That was a good game of rugby.” Quins must now face Gloucester and then Exeter, both playoff rivals.

4/30/2022,"HSBC is facing pressure to break up after one of its largest shareholders told the UK-headquartered bank to consider spinning off its profitable Asian operations centred on Hong Kong. Chinese insurer Ping An has discussed listing the Asian operations separately in Hong Kong, Bloomberg first reported. Ping An owns 8.3% of the bank, according to the latest public filings, a stake worth £8.2bn. HSBC has increasingly found itself pulled between its UK headquarters, where it is regulated by British authorities, and Asia, where many analysts believe its future growth prospects lie. The bank was heavily criticised by MPs last year for agreeing to freeze the accounts of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. HSBC also publicly backed a security law in Hong Kong widely seen as repressive. HSBC earlier this week reported a 30% drop in profits for the first quarter of 2022, amid concerns about rising defaults and the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, its Asian operations accounted for 61% of adjusted pre-tax profits. However, any break-up would probably entail a long process with the deep involvement of UK regulators and the government. No such discussions have started. Chairman Mark Tucker told shareholders at the bank’s annual meeting on Friday that he was content with the current strategy. An HSBC spokesperson said that the lender was “one of the better performing bank stocks globally over the last year”. “HSBC has a regular programme of engagement with all our investors and is committed to maximising value for all our shareholders,” the spokesperson said. “We believe we’ve got the right strategy and are focused on executing it. Delivering on this strategy is the fastest way to generate higher returns and maximise shareholder value. “HSBC supports customers, corporates and institutions across key capital and trade hubs around the world. This network manifests itself in our leading global franchises across retail, wealth and wholesale banking. The most important thing for management to focus on is continuing to drive higher returns, as we have done very successfully, despite the disruptions of Covid-19.” The Financial Times reported that Ping An has expressed frustrations particularly with the Bank of England’s direction that UK banks should not pay dividends at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Ping An had also threatened to vote against the bank’s new remuneration policy as well as the re-election of several board members ahead of Friday’s annual meeting, the Financial Times reported.

4/30/2022,"My mum, Margaret Clowes, who has died aged 85, believed that every day was a chance to learn something new, see something different and enjoy a small sherry. Born in Mossley in Cheshire, the eldest of five, she lost hearing in one ear and suffered lung damage as a baby due to contracting measles and pneumonia, but neither impaired her abilities and zest for life. Her parents, Miriam (nee Eardley) and John Clowes, a lorry driver who became a master butcher, sent her to St Audrey’s, a Parents’ National Education Union school in Congleton, where she made lifelong friends and discovered a love of literature and art. In her teens she was an enthusiastic teenage member of the Biddulph Players amateur dramatics society, in the neighbouring Staffordshire town. On leaving Derby Teacher Training College, she careered around Europe on a scooter with her cousin Ruth, and in 1961 married Michael Fitt, a building society manager. With two daughters, Sally Ann (born in 1964) and me (1965), the family moved from London to south Wales, Northern Ireland to Yorkshire, then back to Wales and Lancashire. After the birth of her daughters, Margaret took up a post as an infants teacher at Kingsfield school in Biddulph, but the family’s subsequent moves made it impossible to sustain a career. So she took up other jobs, including as a shop assistant in a shoe shop and a hardware store, at an estate agents and as a civil servant in Cardiff, in the early to mid-80s. Moving back to Biddulph in 1986, followed by her divorce in 1987, Margaret typically embraced life with bravery and positivity, travelling to the US, Asia, Australia, north Africa and Europe. She also volunteered at Biddulph Grange, the National Trust-owned house, in whose magnificent gardens she had played for hours as a child. In 2007, Margaret moved to York, close to me and her much-loved granddaughters. A volunteer at York hospital for more than 10 years, she also became a volunteer guide at York Art Gallery, particularly for the Anthony Shaw Collection, built up over more than 40 years and on long-term loan to York Museums Trust. She had a diagnosis of breast cancer in late 2020, and a recurrence proved terminal. Anthony wrote to her in March this year: “Always a pleasure to see your smiling face and catch up with your lively descriptions of visitor reactions and your own to our new displays. The way you portrayed your own passions always enlivened my own visits, as it must have done to many visitors of all ages.” A beloved sister, friend, mum, granny and volunteer, whatever Margaret did and wherever she went, it was with determination and a vibrancy that was infectious. She is survived by her sisters, Marion and Miriam, brothers, John and Robert, daughters, Sally Ann and me, and granddaughters, Phoebe and Esmée.",News/Society,Margaret Clowes obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/29/margaret-clowes-obituary
4/30/2022,"Was I the only person in the country to bang my head on the desk when Scott Morrison decided to goad Anthony Albanese about who had worked harder during their respective periods of Covid isolation? I doubt it. Given there are so many important things to talk about, washing up in a campaign telenovela, a man-off felt particularly grating – about as soothing as nails dragging down a chalk board. But once I’d stopped ranting to no one in particular about opportunity costs and diversions and the persistent absence of seriousness, once equanimity was restored, Morrison’s petty mind game assumed more interest, because it tells us something about where we are in this contest. I mean, we know that, in practical terms, of course. The calendar tells us we’ve reached the mid point of the campaign. But in reality, the contest begins this weekend. Australians have returned from holidays. Pre-poll voting opens in a week. Albanese is now out of isolation and has positioned in Perth for his official campaign launch on Sunday. Morrison’s prime ministership is now on the clock. Obviously Morrison put his prime ministership on the clock three weeks ago, when he drove out to see the governor general. But in the elasticities of campaign time, six weeks to polling day feels like an eternity, while three weeks feels like a nanosecond. My point is time always accelerates at the back end of a campaign. 21 May has assumed gravitational force. The contest has felt bogged and the tropes tired, but it is about to reset and sprint. Morrison is on the hunt for momentum. The apex predator is prowling on the range, looking for something he can use. Goading Albanese about his work ethic could just be a preschool sulk. The Labor leader’s proficiency with tactical retreats and dancing between the raindrops genuinely irritates Morrison. They are oil and water, these combatants, because Morrison lives to dominate and Albanese will prevail by default if that’s what the moment demands. But I don’t think it is a sulk. I think it’s a calculation. Morrison is trying to needle Albanese into what air force types call a performance take off – where the jet screams down the runway and hurtles into the sky like a rocket. Morrison’s hint of Albanese malingering, or hiding, is a provocation intended to elicit a response, and the prime minister has accompanied the editorialising with a concrete demand that Albanese agree to two leaders debates on commercial television next week. The goading surfaces deep need. Morrison needs Albanese back centre stage to make what remains of the contest a referendum on the Labor leader’s competence. You can’t pin a competitor who isn’t in the ring. Having had Covid himself, Morrison knows the lingering after effects of the virus are fatigue and brain fog. Debates, after a day of campaigning, are gruelling encounters, physically and mentally, even for seasoned professionals. So Morrison’s calculation is simple: Albanese is significantly more likely to make a mistake when he’s not 100%. Again, time is of the essence. Morrison knows he’s got to find a pivot point in the campaign, and finding it is all on him. The prime minister has three weeks to convince voters that Albanese represents unacceptable risk. At the moment swinging voters are hesitant about the Labor leader. A chunk aren’t yet convinced he’s the antidote for their dissatisfaction. Morrison has to shift that voter hesitation to outright risk aversion. But the problem is the prime minister’s own credibility has taken a hammering. Morrison can contend Albanese constitutes risk (and does in disciplined fashion most days on the hustings) but his disapproval is now so high, voters will discount what they hear. So Morrison needs Albanese to make that case for him. He needs Albanese to demonstrate that he is out of his depth. Now Albanese helped with that mission during the first week of the campaign with his stumble on the cash rate and unemployment rate. That vision is in the bank. The Liberals can deploy it in the barrage of negative advertising that generally happens in the closing weeks of a campaign, and the message pretty much writes itself. If the Reserve Bank hikes interest rates, or even if it doesn’t, I’d expect to see Liberal advertisements telling voters if Albanese doesn’t know what the cash rate is, how can you trust him to keep rates low? So Morrison has that. It feels necessary but not sufficient. So he is hungry for more fallibility to weaponise. So we have the stupid mind game about debates. Morrison has agreed to debates on Nine and Seven next week and demanded Albanese turn up. Thus far he’s blanked a request from the ABC and a seperate demand from Labor to front the National Press Club in the final week of the campaign. The choice of debate venues is interesting. It tells us with some precision who the prime minister wants to speak with – and I don’t mean the political editors of the networks, Mark Riley and Chris Uhlmann. I’m talking about viewers. Fascinating research from a couple of years ago examining Australian media audience polarisation found viewers of commercial TV networks and the subscription channel Sky News are more right-leaning than the ABC television audience, which attracts viewers evenly from across the political spectrum. Morrison agreed to the first debate, hosted by Sky News, and now wants more time on Seven and Nine. While it’s possible Morrison ends up in a debate hosted by the ABC, or one moderated by Laura Tingle at the National Press Club, it’s more than reasonable to speculate he’d rather avoid both. Wanting the leaders debate on Nine and Seven tells us Morrison is still trying to shore up elements of his base flirting with a protest vote. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It also tells us he’s on the hunt for voters in Labor’s column who can be recruited on cultural affinity grounds. Some in the government say Morrison is holding up well enough in regional Queensland and in the outer suburbs of big cities. You hear there’s not a lot of warmth for Albanese on this terrain. But there’s also a growing sense that Liberal incumbents are in serious trouble in metropolitan contests with teal independents – that a number of these seats could fall. You hear the same story from different people on high rotation: Liberal moderates are getting a positive reception themselves from constituents, but Morrison is absolutely, irredeemably, toxic. It’s possible this pessimism is being promulgated deliberately as part of a mind focusing exercise – if voters in progressive Liberal heartland are led to believe courtesy of precision backgrounding of journalists that their protest vote will actually work, and possibly even install a Labor government, then they might think twice about voting for Allegra Spender or Zoe Daniel or Kylea Tink. But if the doom and gloom isn’t tactical, if it reflects reality, then Morrison’s only hope of remaining in power is trying to boost the Coalition’s primary vote in areas of the country where that’s possible, and grabbing seats in the Labor column to offset losses in the teal contests. If he can’t do that, it’s over.

4/30/2022,"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. Analysis by Julian Borger explained how a series of mysterious explosions in Moldova has raised the threat of Russia’s war in Ukraine spilling over into new territory, with unpredictable consequences. Separatist authorities in the Moscow-backed region of Transnistria have blamed the incidents on Ukrainian infiltrators, while the Kyiv government alleged they were false-flag attacks designed to provide a pretext for an infusion of Russian troops, just as similar blasts in the Donbas preceded the 24 February Russian invasion of Ukraine. A Russian move into Transnistria would pose an imminent threat to the sovereignty of Moldova, which, like Ukraine, has shown increasing interest in joining Nato. On Thursday, Moldova’s deputy prime minister, Nicu Popescu, said the attacks represented “a very dangerous new moment in the history of our region”. One of Europe’s poorest countries, Moldova is grappling with a large influx of refugees and the economic fallout of the war, which has stopped nearly 15% of its exports. With the start of this new phase in the war, a layer is being stripped away from the buffer that has thus far kept Nato and Russia from coming into direct, hostile contact, during the cold war and since, Borger writes. And if the ominous explosions in Transnistria are auguries of a new Putin gambit, Moldova could find itself to be the next proving ground where this dangerous new world makes itself felt. Dan Boffey in Brussels, Philip Olterman in Berlin and Rob Davies in London wrote about the consequences for Europe after Russia halted gas supplies to two EU countries and threatened others, in a move condemned by European leaders as blackmail. The move, described by Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, as a “direct attack” on his country, was justified by the Kremlin as a response to a failure of the two countries to comply with demands for payments to be made in roubles. It has led, however, to a dangerous standoff as Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said any EU country giving in to Russia by paying for gas in roubles would be in breach of the bloc’s sanctions regime, with which the UK and others have acted in lockstep. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst for the UK and Europe at the foreign exchange company Oanda, said: “This may be a warning sign to others in the hope that they don’t follow suit, but if they do, the standoff could play havoc with energy prices. With the Kremlin putting itself in a position where it must apply the same punishment to all if they don’t comply, Europe may find itself without Russian gas or looking weak.” Hungary has said it is happy to pay in roubles and, according to reports, three of Europe’s biggest gas companies – Germany’s Uniper, Italy’s Eni and Austria’s OMV – are also examining ways to comply with Putin’s decree. In a separate piece of analysis, Rob Davies asks: how worried should Europe be? Isobel Koshiw visited Zaporizhzhia, the only large city in south-east Ukraine under Ukrainian control. It has become a destination for the hundreds of thousands of people who fled Russian occupation, but with 70% of the wider region under Russian military control, there are fears that Moscow’s forces will attempt to take it. As preparations for the arrival of the war get under way, life in the city is surprisingly normal – even busy – for wartime Ukraine. “You can see for yourself people are out, going to work – the city is prepared but it won’t come to that,” said Ivan Ariefiev, the press secretary of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, at one of a series of war-related training courses being offered to the city’s teachers and journalists. Attendees, who are then expected to train the wider community, were taught how to load a gun, administer first aid and do a basic medical evaluation.  Fléchettes are rarely used in modern warfare. Small, metal and sharp like a dart, thousands can be stored inside each shell. Once fired, the shell will detonate on a timer, spreading the tiny arrows far and wide. The weapon was used in the first world war – dropped from airplanes to pierce the helmets of enemy infantry. Now, they are being removed from the heads and chests of civilians in Ukraine. Lorenzo Tondo reported on the discovery of the tiny metal arrows in bodies of men and women in mass graves, allegedly killed during the Russian occupation of Bucha, Ukraine. “We found several really thin, nail-like objects in the bodies of men and women and so did others of my colleagues in the region,” Vladyslav Pirovskyi, a Ukrainian forensic doctor, told the Guardian. “It is very hard to find those in the body, they are too thin. The majority of these bodies come from the Bucha-Irpin region.” Russian forces captured Bucha, 30km north-west of Kyiv, after ferocious fighting following Russia’s invasion in February. Towards the end of March, mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of people who had apparently been massacred came to light. As defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh explains, the west’s war aims are expanding. On Monday, Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, said the west’s goal was to “weaken Russia” to the point where it could no longer threaten its neighbours. A day later, the British junior defence minister James Heappey said it would be “completely legitimate” for Ukraine to use western weapons to strike inside Russia. On Wednesday, western officials said they would like to see Ukraine restored to the boundaries existing before 24 February – the start of the Russian invasion – “as a minimum”. With Ukraine unable to achieve that objective on its own, the question will become how much more Britain and other Nato members are prepared to commit. On Wednesday, the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, appeared very committed, adopting in her speech the most uncompromising of approaches to a final peace settlement: endorsing the measures above but also reparations – a payment to Ukraine for the damage Moscow had inflicted – in an echo of the principles followed by allied forces against Germany in 1919. Discussions on how to define failure in any peace settlement are at an early stage among the cell of diplomats from “the Quad” – the US, UK, France and Germany – discussing the issue. The discussions will evolve as the battlefield evolves.

4/30/2022,"In a judgment delivered this week, New Zealand’s high court found that elements of the country’s Managed Isolation and Quarantine (MIQ) system, the cornerstone of our world-leading pandemic response, were unlawful. The decision dropped to a good deal of delight. One well-known conservative commentator wrote: “So the courts have found the lockdown was illegal, the vaccine mandate was illegal and MIQ was illegal, so can anyone name a major aspect of the response that hasn’t been found to be illegal?” That response is predictably mischievous – none of those measures were ruled “illegal” – but it typifies the response. Perhaps the best-known of the conservative commentators involved wrote: “Jacinda Ardern has been found by the courts to have abused her powers by illegally preventing New Zealand citizens from leaving & returning home.” That isn’t what the high court found, but accurate reporting is hardly the point. In New Zealand the political right is fighting a relentless battle to rewrite the history of New Zealand’s pandemic success. For almost two years New Zealanders kept the virus from breaching the border. After the first lockdown in March 2020, Covid-19 was eliminated and New Zealanders went about their lives more or less as normal. Public health experts calculate that if we suffered the same rate of Covid-19 deaths as the UK, up to 10,000 people would be dead. That’s not far short of the number of New Zealanders who perished in the second world war. Add to those life-saving efforts the fact that the economy grew 14% in the third quarter of 2020 – the highest rate ever. That same year, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and her Labour party were re-elected in a landslide. Lockdowns are often given the credit for guaranteeing this success. Alert level 4 in March 2020 saw New Zealanders “stop the spread”, to resurrect an old phrase. Covid-19 cases fell to zero in June. Even in the more infectious and deadlier Delta outbreak, a strict lockdown beginning in August 2021 functionally eliminated Delta come the end of summer. But New Zealand’s primary defence was always MIQ. The system of isolation and quarantine for returning New Zealanders and visitors ensured that the virus rarely made it into the community. MIQers would spend two weeks in a hotel as a means of protecting the population. It was a necessary sacrifice and, in the scheme of things, a modest one. MIQ bought time for New Zealand to shelter as vaccines and antivirals were developed. The time it bought means that in the ongoing Omicron outbreak, with more than 90% of eligible adults vaccinated, the virus is proving no more fatal than the seasonal flu. This is something for which to thank MIQ, vaccine scientists, and public health providers (while acknowledging, of course, that even a single death from Omicron or the flu is a tragedy). And yet the political right is determined to rewrite this success. In a recent interview Chris Luxon, the National party leader, called on the government to abandon the traffic light system. Given the events of 2020 and 2021, that’s a bizarre intervention. Why would you take the side of the virus and let it really rip? But Luxon’s intervention highlights the relentless campaign to undermine New Zealand’s success. Not because recent memory of the pandemic is faulty – polls as early as this year reinforced majority support for the government’s response – but because critics of the government and Ardern sense an opportunity for the current and inevitable Omicron outbreak to define every outbreak that was prevented. This opportunity partly centres on criticism of the current spread and the pressure it places on an underfunded health system. The primary node of criticism, though, is the apparent threat to freedom and liberty that the government represents. In March and April countless stories were appearing criticising the red traffic light setting as having destroyed the hospitality sector. The loudest criticisms of MIQ, too, were often made by businesspeople keen to import workers without the need for limited MIQ spaces. Never mind the problem was, and, is the virus, not the efforts to control it. On a proper reading none of these criticisms – whether of MIQ or the traffic light settings – have much to do with freedom and liberty. These are calls for unrestrained commerce, the ability to trade no matter the circumstances. In their analysis, the right to conduct commerce, no matter what, was more important than any public health imperative. The clown convoy that made its way to Wellington – occupying parliament, destroying the grounds and impinging on the rights of Thorndon’s residents – was the sharp end of this “do what I want” attitude. We cannot let these people win. So many lives were saved in 2020 and 2021. The economy thrived. The government’s quick action gave us the time to vaccinate, preparing us for the Omicron outbreak, for which other countries that let the virus rip and mutate were responsible. The high court did find that the lottery aspect of MIQ was unlawful, but it acknowledged that MIQ itself was lawful, and that it was a justified and proportionate policy response in a pandemic. We should not forget that.

4/30/2022,"Clive Palmer’s centrepiece campaign pledge to cap homeowners’ interest rates for five years has been dismissed by economists as “radical”, “crazy” and “utterly irresponsible” even though it will probably appeal to some gullible voters. According to the United Australia party’s website, the mining billionaire’s “economic plan for freedom and prosperity” pledges to set a maximum 3% interest rate for all home loans to head off a looming mass default as lending rates start to rise. Wednesday’s surprisingly large 5.1% consumer price inflation figure has stoked expectations the Reserve Bank will be forced to lift its cash rate target from 0.1% when its board meets on Tuesday. Market home loans rates have been rising for months, with most fixed rates now between 3% and 5% with variable rates above 2%. “If our interest rate for home loans doubles from 2% to 4%, 60% of all mortgages will be in default and if the interest rate goes to between 6% to 8%, as it most surely will, the default rate will be greater than 90%,” Palmer said, citing unnamed “other studies”. Elsewhere on UAP’s website, Palmer blames the $1tn debt racked up by the Liberal and Labor governments as the trigger for the rising interest rates. “The real estate market will then collapse and foreign buyers will flood our real estate market as they will have the money to buy up our properties,” his national policy states. “We have to stop Australians from losing their homes!” Guardian Australia sought comment from the UAP and Craig Kelly, the ex-Liberal MP and now UAP candidate for the NSW seat of Hughes on how the rate cap would work. News Corp tabloids cited Kelly as saying the federal government could implement the plan by selling Treasury bonds at 0.1% to 0.2% and “on-lending that cheap cash to retail banks” who would then keep the mortgage rate under 3%. Anna Bligh, chief executive of the Australian Banking Association, called the plan “magic pudding economics” that would “wreak havoc across banking and financial services sector” if ever implemented, according to the papers. Alan Oster, NAB’s chief economist, said his bank typically avoided comment on such policies. “I don’t know how [Palmer] would implement it other than re-regulating rates, and that would be radically different,” Oster said. “Who knows how they would do that?” Saul Eslake, an independent economist who formerly worked at ANZ Bank, said it was “constitutionally and legally possible” for an Australian government to impose a legislated ceiling on mortgage rates. Up until the late 1980s, such a ceiling existed, at the treasurer’s discretion. However, Eslake said “it would be an utterly irresponsible thing for any government to seek to do”, given the different conditions more than three decades on. Timo Henckel, from the Australian National University’s Research School of Economics, said while he had scant details, the policy “doesn’t sound workable”. One approach could be to intervene to set “severe financial market regulation”. That would “take us back to, say, the 1970s”, and would be at odds with the liberalised capital markets that Australia now operates, he said. The other possibility would be for the central bank to provide a standing facility to pump as much money into financial markets needed to keep interest rates at 3%, Henckel said. Such a move, though, would be a “crazy policy because there’d be so much liquidity sloshing around in the system”, resulting in more inflation. In addition, “it would really only work if they seriously compromised the RBA’s independence … and [would] require massive legal intervention in a way that I’m not even sure they’d be able to do it”, he said. Australia’s banks, meanwhile, rely on international capital markets to source a significant share of their own funds, and would find it harder to raise money in such a distorted system. “They’re never going to be asked to implement it anyway so really it’s just an attention grabber in order get votes,” Henckel said. “It’s not a genuine policy.”",News/Australia news,"Clive Palmer’s campaign pledge to cap home loan rates ‘utterly irresponsible’, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/30/clive-palmers-campaign-pledge-to-cap-home-loan-rates-utterly-irresponsible-experts-say
4/30/2022,"Scott Morrison’s comment last month that “the best way to support people renting a house is to help them buy a house” was seized on by some as a “let them eat cake moment”. The prime minister was responding to a question from Channel Nine’s Today Show about why the federal budget hadn’t done more for renters. The query was unusual because renters typically get far less heed from media and politicians than homeowners, despite them making up about a third – and rising – share of the population. The scant attention is curious given the plight of renters is generally deteriorating nationwide. According to CoreLogic, average rents rose 12.9% in the two years to March, which is seven times the 1.8% increase of the preceding two-year period. The well-publicised outflow of city folk to the regions during Covid is also making it worse for locals. Regional rents have increased a fifth in those two years, or double the pace of the increase in state capitals, CoreLogic data shows. Groups from the Australian Council of Social Service to the Committee for Sydney have led calls to address housing affordability that have produced little substantial policy from the major parties, at least federally. That results fall so far short of needs reveal much about the sort of society we live in and where we’re headed. That is, one with a falling share of people owning their homes in almost all age groups. As one senior member of the NSW government told me recently, housing has gone from an essential “roof over our heads” to a commodity for wealth accumulation and speculation. Federal and state policies had largely served to steer ever more money into the sector, favouring those already in the market. The media, too, seems conflicted. Open up a newspaper, particularly on a Saturday, and readers can ogle glossy property magazines and articles touting celebrities trading trophy homes. Both News Corp and Nine Entertainment, the nation’s dominant media groups, rely after all on the property-spruiking REA Group and Domain, respectively, to shore up revenues. Cost of living issues alone suggest more coverage on rents is warranted. Within the basket of goods and services that the Bureau of Statistics uses to track consumer price increases, rents carry twice the weight of transport fuel. Despite that, they drew far fewer stories than “pain at the bowser” tales that recently panicked the government into halving the fuel excise until after the election. Regional renters, though, have an extra reason to feel neglected. The ABS bases the rental weighting within the CPI on capital cities only, meaning the recent run-up in regional rentals has not been picked up in the inflation figures. The latest data, out on Wednesday, showed rents rising again in all cities, including Melbourne and Sydney which had been hard hit by the absence of foreign students during the Covid lockdowns. A revival of migration will accelerate those rises. Housing issues have been slow to become a focus in the campaign, despite rising expectations the Reserve Bank will soon start lifting interest rates – and keep raising them for the next couple of years – to stem inflation. ASX futures market shows investors predict the RBA's cash rate will be at 2.5% by the end of 2022, whether or not the central bank makes its first move on 3 May. #ausvotes #auspol pic.twitter.com/B2O25E5vm9 As another instance, the Greens’ promise of 1 million more low-cost homes, the most ambitious of the parties in the election, was all but ignored despite the policy making up a large part of Adam Bandt’s National Press Club speech on 13 April. The media instead focused on the Greens leader’s “Google it, mate” slapdown, and pledges to aid dental care and halt coal and gas projects. The omission surprised advisers who remain keen to get the issue back in the spotlight. The policy would not come cheap, decreasing the fiscal balance by $7.5bn and the headline cash balance by $30.8bn over the budget forward estimates period, the Parliamentary Budget Office said. For the ALP, the top task is 30,000 “new social and affordable housing properties” over the first five years. The Coalition, meanwhile, is stressing home ownership, while “incentivising” regional home construction. In a comprehensive study for the Australian Council for Social Service Acoss led by University of New South Wales professor Hal Pawson, the authors examined how governments dealt with Covid from a housing perspective, and what it revealed about their priorities. “Income support did more to absorb the income shock of the pandemic, to a significant extent letting housing policy and, especially, landlords, off the hook,” they said. “Restrictions on evictions and rent increases were lifted just as many regions were seeing a major escalation in rents and tightening availability.” “This strengthens the sense that housing policy objectives around affordability, security and prevention of homelessness are still lower priorities than maintenance of housing asset values, rent revenues and loan serviceability,” they said. Pawson said that while the house price cycle was likely to be near its top, ahead of those RBA rate rises, rents would probably keep rising. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Pawson cites 1996, the year the Howard government took office, as a “break point” when the annual national social housing construction program finished. Since then Australia’s population has swelled 30%, but the stock of social housing has grown only 4% even taking in a burst of spending during the global financial crisis by the Rudd government. “In the last few years, we’ve only barely been building enough to make good the loss from demolition and sales every year,” Pawson said. In the past 10 years, social housing has made up just 1% to 2% of new homes built. By contrast, in the quarter-century after 1945, one in six homes were public housing. “There is a historical precedent for this in Australia, of the state being a substantial source of housing production,” Pawson said. “It’s just we’ve forgotten that we ever did it.”",News/Australia news,"Locked out: housing has become a path to wealth, but renters have been left behind",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/30/locked-out-housing-has-become-a-path-to-wealth-but-renters-have-been-left-behind
4/30/2022,"Staring at the camera, Anto’s face, wide-eyed and child-like, invites a simple question. How could anyone, let alone Australia’s federal crime fighting agency, see an adult gazing back at them? Anto was 15 in June 2009 when he was on a fishing boat carrying 50 Afghan and Iranian asylum seekers that was intercepted near Ashmore Reef. From a poor Indonesian village, he jumped at a vague offer of work aboard the boat. He had no idea he was going to Australia. All he knew was the money would help his family survive. When the boat was intercepted, interview transcripts show Anto told Australian authorities in no uncertain terms he was a child, born on 14 April 1994. Under Australian federal police policy, he should have been sent home. Instead, police relied on a deeply flawed X-ray technique to deem him an adult. The date of birth Anto gave police was altered to 14 April 1991, and the new date was included on his prosecution notice, a sworn document seen by Guardian Australia. With the flick of a pen, Anto suddenly became an adult. The Guardian has obtained images of Anto when he was first detained by Australian authorities. They show, for the first time, the child-like face law enforcement encountered after the 2009 interception. Despite his insistence that he was 15, police relied on the wrist X-ray and hauled Anto before the Western Australian district court, where he was prosecuted as an adult and sentenced to five years in an adult maximum security facility in Perth. Police had changed Anto’s date of birth to fit with an X-ray taken of his wrist, which their preferred radiologist used to deem his bone mature. Using a reference tool based on the bones of healthy, middle-class Americans, the doctor made an assumption that the wrist bone generally matures at the age of 19. “It is [a] reasonable interpretation that Mr Anto is older than 19 years of age,” the radiologist told police. The technique has since been completely discredited. But police had also been told years before Anto’s arrest that wrist X-ray comparisons were open to error and an “inexact science”. Senior government figures had also been briefed on UK guidelines stating the technique could not be used to accurately estimate age and may have a margin of error of up to five years. Colin Singer, then an independent prison visitor, found Anto in the WA jail system back in 2010 and has been fighting for justice for him and other children jailed as adult people smugglers ever since. Singer still remembers his shock at seeing someone clearly so young being held in an adult jail. “They were all nice kids, but he was one of the ones who stood out. He was a really, really nice kid,” Singer said. “They were tiny … they not only looked like kids, they acted like kids.” On Tuesday, six other Indonesians won a fight to overturn their convictions and clear their names, redressing an injustice allowed by grave failures of police, prosecutors and the federal government. The court ruled a “substantial miscarriage of justice” had occurred in their cases due to the reliance on wrist X-rays. But Anto’s conviction still stands. For him and one other Indonesian, Samsul Bahar, the road to justice is not so clear. Both appealed against their convictions on unrelated grounds while still behind bars, exhausting their appeal rights. They were eventually released in 2012 and returned to Indonesia, where they remain. Now, more than 10 years later, both are left relying heavily on a referral from the federal attorney general to lodge a fresh appeal against their convictions in the WA courts. Their plea came before the former attorney general Christian Porter in 2020, who refused to assist them, saying they had no prospect of success. Guardian Australia revealed this week that Porter had denied referrals in similar cases, despite having prior involvement in the issue as the WA corrections minister in 2009 and 2010. As corrections minister, Porter had received a complaint warning him he had children in his government’s jails. In a letter in December 2010, seen by Guardian Australia, Porter relied on the wrist X-rays and said: “None of the prisoners currently in departmental prisons have been verified as being under the age of 18.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Singer said it was sad the Australian government was still denying culpability for what it did to the children. “I think this injustice has gone on long enough,” he said. “It doesn’t reflect well that in Australia, as a country, we would treat young children like this, of any nationality, of any race, of any religion.” The Australian federal police had reason to doubt the reliability of the X-ray evidence long before the cases against Anto, Samsul and the other children in 2010. They were involved in a 2002 case in which a court heard serious concerns about the technique’s reliability. The immigration department had also sounded the alarm internally to the government about wrist X-rays before the convictions of Anto and Samsul. A briefing to the federal government warned against relying on wrist X-rays and pointed to the UK guidelines on the practice, which categorically stated the technique should not be used to determine age.

Last year, Branson told Guardian Australia she thought at the time political pressure was felt by the government agencies responsible for investigating and prosecuting smuggling. “I concluded that these agencies wanted to be seen to be bringing prosecutions and securing significant penalties. They wanted to be seen to be taking people-smuggling seriously. “They wanted to find some way to determine age, there was a high level of anxiety to find a biological marker that could tell you precisely how old a person was, but, in the end, their reliance on the wrist X-rays proved to be ill-founded.” The approach of Porter in denying referrals to the children diverged from that of former attorney general George Brandis. Brandis received the same request in 2015 from lawyers for another boy, Ali Jasmin, who was jailed when he was 12. The wrist X-ray technique had deemed him an adult. Brandis referred the case to the WA court of appeal and Jasmin’s conviction was ultimately overturned.",News/Australia news,‘They were tiny’: the Indonesians still fighting their conviction as adults in Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/30/they-were-tiny-the-indonesians-still-fighting-their-conviction-as-adults-in-australia
4/30/2022,"Vivien Pailas has one piece of advice for anyone hunting for a rental property in Sydney: “Lower your expectations.” Pailas relocated back to Australia in February with her British husband, Simon Myall, and her five-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Georgia, after 15 years living in London. She didn’t expect it would take 35 house inspections and a rental agent to secure her family a home. “We got here in early February, and my wrong assumption was we’d just get an Airbnb for a few weeks. “I knew [the rental market] was difficult. I was on Facebook groups that were talking about how hard things were. But I thought, we’ve got money in the bank, my husband has a good job … I didn’t anticipate it would take so long and be so difficult. “We stayed at my parents’ for the first week. Then 10 days after we arrived, I booked an Airbnb on the northern beaches for a week while I started the rental search. “It was just crazy, there were people lining up at the front of the houses, lines of people snaking down the road, it was really disheartening. “I extended the Airbnb for a week, then we had to leave and I got another [one]. My husband was working in makeshift accommodation and I was having to entertain my five-and-a-half-year-old and dragging her around viewings, it was all getting really stressful so we ended up going back to my parents. “Because we didn’t have a permanent address, I couldn’t get her into school, so I tried to get her into childcare but I couldn’t because of her age. She was crying every night, really unsettled … it was all just a nightmare. “Then a friend suggested a rental agent, because we were going to a lot of viewings where the houses were nothing like the photos on the website, really misleading, so you’d walk in and walk straight back out again. “We were looking at approximately $1,000 per week for a three-bedroom house … a very decent budget for suburbs in the inner west and in the Lane Cove area on the lower north shore. We applied for a few places in Lane Cove and didn’t get them. “They were properties that were in really good condition, renovated, all the mod cons. “These were the properties that were in demand the most, because many places were quite old and nothing had been done to them. It was very deflating finding a place you really liked and could see yourself living in, then not getting it. “I went to some places that were just dumps. “There was one instance where we walked into a property that still had the current tenants living there and the place was disgusting. It had clothes everywhere, dirty dishes in the sink, muddy floors and smelt like mould. We walked straight back out again. “Others – the photos were really, really old. Or they’d put one or two photos and that’s it. And there was high competition – we were applying and not getting houses, even offering three months’ rent upfront. “So I had to pay for the privilege [of a rental agent] to get a property … which I think is just ludicrous. I didn’t even know they existed. “The fact the service exists is really telling of how dire the market is. And we’re lucky we can afford it. It’s an extra expense we didn’t budget for, but we had to suck it up. “She started helping us narrowing down areas – because the ones we were looking at were so in demand and the stock was so low, there just weren’t enough rental properties, and the competition was so fierce, we had to look elsewhere. “I had coaching from her on how to secure a property – how to introduce yourself and be memorable. She also told us to get references from old neighbours to say what respectable people we were, and to apply for properties before we’d seen them. “It’s ridiculous talking about it, but that was our reality – going to viewings and trying to schmooze the rental agent, saying ‘Hi! We’re the couple that just moved from London, we’ve got a small child and we love the area!’ “I probably did about 20 inspections, and then the rental agent did another 15 before we eventually found a rental property in April. And we were ready. We knew what we needed to say, what we needed to offer, we were primed and got it. “We settled on something in Lindfield, on the upper north shore, that didn’t tick all the boxes, but it will do. “We’ve definitely gone over budget, but we just needed a place to live and to get my daughter into school. It’s not in the area we wanted to live in and it’s $300 more per week than we wanted to spend. “But its got space for my husband and [me] to work from home, and we wanted outdoor space because we didn’t have that luxury in London. We wanted to live in a house – and that’s where the problem is, there’s really high demand for houses, and they’re really, really expensive. “You can search properties and see how much tenants are paying for rent. And in most cases, rentals we were looking at were increasing rent by $50 to $100 a week … they’re just taking advantage of the crisis. “London’s rental market is pricey depending on where you live. But there’s a stack more properties available. Here, there’s just not enough houses to go around. “We’re just really relieved we actually have a place to live, not crashing at my parents’ house in one tiny spare room for three of us.” Have you had a bad experience with the rental market?

4/30/2022,"With all eyes fixed on the federal election campaign, you’d be forgiven for nearly forgetting Victoria’s treasurer, Tim Pallas, is set to hand down a state budget in a couple of days. So far, all we know is that health will be a main theme of the pre-election budget. Improving lengthy ambulance wait times, emergency department overcrowding and the state’s triple zero call-taking system are front of mind after several much-publicised deaths, including that of a 72-year-old man who waited more than three hours for a bed at a regional hospital earlier this month. “It will be a very big budget for those basic services that make a massive difference to people’s lives,” premier Daniel Andrews said at a recent press conference. “You’ll see short, medium and long-term investments in the budget that are about supporting our nurses, our ambos, our call takers to do more, to do better, and to provide the best care that we could possibly provide.” In terms of pre-budget announcements, at the time of writing just $277.5m has been allocated – to combine the Victorian Certificate of Education and the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning from next year. By way of comparison, days out from last year’s budget, $4.2bn worth of spending and $2.7bn in new taxes had already been announced, as had the state’s deficit figure. It’s not surprising the state government is holding off on any significant announcements during the federal election campaign, when it risks either being ignored or conflated with federal Labor. But any spending will also inevitably lead to talk about the state’s debt and the government’s plans to pay it off. Pallas is midway through his four-step fiscal strategy, first unveiled in 2020 as the state emerged from an extended lockdown after its second wave of Covid-19. Step one – creating jobs, reducing unemployment and restoring economic growth – has largely been achieved, given the state unemployment stands at a low 4.2% and the workforce participation rate is high. Step two – returning to an operating cash surplus – is also well on its way, with a $2.5bn cash surplus included in last year’s budget for 2022/23. Steps three and four – returning to operating surpluses and stabilising debt levels – will probably be a priority in this year’s budget, particularly if the government wants to fend off any attacks from the opposition ahead of November’s poll. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Victoria carries the largest debt load of all the states and territories. As per the latest budget update, net debt is set to hit $104.5bn – or 21.1% of gross state product by June this year. This is expected to grow to $162.7bn – or 27.9% – by 2024/25, $6.4bn more than initially forecast, largely due to additional government support during the third wave of Covid-19 in 2021. Pallas has maintained the debt is manageable, citing low interest rates and the state’s swift recovery from the pandemic. This is despite concerns from ratings agencies Moody’s and S&P, who both downgraded the state’s AAA credit rating after the 2020/21 budget. Interest expense as a share of total revenue is expected to average 5% a year over the budget and forward estimates. It will be interesting to see if this figure changes come Tuesday, given it’s all but guaranteed interest rates will rise. So what will the government do? It’s unlikely it will introduce any new taxes to pay down the debt – especially in an election year, where cost of living remains chief among voters’ concerns. Indeed, a policy to tax property developers in order to fund social housing was scrapped just 10 days after it was announced in February, partly due to concerns it handed the opposition a golden opportunity to target the government over housing affordability. Earlier this month, Pallas said he was “not in the business of austerity” but seemed to flag possible cuts to the public service. “I don’t believe that austerity is the way to economic growth. There are more efficient ways to spend. We’ve put in place arrangements such as base reviews on departmental spending … and we continue to be committed to making sure we run an efficient budget,” he said. In 2019, the government outlined a plan to cut $1.7bn from state government department budgets, though it was largely put on hold due to the pandemic. Earlier this week, Pallas told The Age he was committed to the savings. The Community and Public Sector Union maintains the public service is still playing catch up post-Covid, clearly in health, but also in areas such as child protection, justice, licensing and registration. It’s easy to see – given the complexities of balancing Victoria’s budget and the likelihood that some will be unhappy come Tuesday afternoon – why the state government is happy with the attention being diverted elsewhere.",News/Australia news,Victoria’s government quietly prepares an election budget while attention is diverted,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/30/victorias-government-quietly-prepares-an-election-budget-while-attention-is-diverted
4/30/2022,"On a Friday afternoon in April 1979, John Mainstone, a physics professor at the University of Queensland, rang his wife at home. He wouldn’t be back that evening, he told her. For the previous 18 years, Mainstone had looked after the pitch drop experiment, a long-form demonstration of the extreme viscosity of pitch. For the first time since August 1970, the pitch was about to drip from its funnel, and Mainstone didn’t want to miss it. Pitch is a resin – a viscoelastic substance derived from petroleum or coal tar, used in bitumen, and for waterproofing. Which is ironic, for as solid as it appears, pitch is fluid: at least, it is when you put it in a funnel, the sloping sides of which create a pressure gradient. Mainstone stayed up all that Friday night. He continued to keep watch on the Saturday, eventually ringing his wife back to tell her he wouldn’t be home that night, either. Still, the globule of (literally) pitch-black liquid hung by a thread from the bottom of its funnel. On Sunday evening, exhausted by his vigil, he went home. By the time he returned to work on a sleep-deprived Monday morning, the pitch had dropped into its beaker. The pitch drop experiment was first set up by Mainstone’s predecessor Thomas Parnell in 1927. Parnell heated and liquefied some pitch, poured it into a sealed funnel, and set it over the beaker inside a large bell jar. In 1930, he cut the stem of the funnel – and waited. Nearly a century later, the original experiment – which has become the longest running laboratory experiment in the world – stands in the foyer of the physics building in the Great Court. The jar is set inside a protective plastic cube, with an analogue Casio desk clock observing each moment as students and staff wander past. The funnel is held aloft by a brass tripod; at the bottom, a shiny black balloon of pitch hovers above the empty beaker. It was Mainstone, taking the experiment on in 1961, who brought the pitch drop to popular attention. He also mentored its third and current custodian, Professor Andrew White, who has watched over it since Mainstone’s death in 2013. Like Parnell, Mainstone died without ever seeing a single drop fall. “I am in no way filling John’s shoes,” White insists. “He was the heart and soul of this.” Mainstone’s dedication was legendary. In 2005, he and (posthumously) Parnell were awarded the Ig Nobel prize – a satirical award noting arcane and trivial achievements in scientific research. The Ig Nobel prize aims to honour work that makes people laugh, but also makes them think. Author Nick Earls first encountered the experiment as a medical student at UQ in the early 1980s, later writing about it in his novel Perfect Skin. “It was a demonstration that all is not necessarily as it seems,” he says. “There is pitch – something that goes into the making of roads, something we think of as totally solid – and it turns out it’s not. It’s just 230m times more viscous than water, and it flows, albeit very slowly.” How slowly? “Far slower than grass growing, far slower than paint drying,” White says, mock-offended by such banal comparisons (and the suggestion that this could be, well, a rather dull experiment to watch). “We’re talking more than 10 times slower than continental drift!” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He directs my attention to the joining of four tiles on the floor. “Those tiles are moving north at 68 millimetres a year, because Australia is moving north at 68 millimetres a year. It’s one of the fastest continents, as far as continental drift goes. The pitch drop is moving at least 10 times slower than that! So it’s literally slower than watching Australia drift north, and people log in live on the internet to watch it. Which I find really fascinating.” It’s true. More than 35,000 people in 160 countries are sweating on the 10th drop of pitch. They’ll be waiting a while yet. Since Parnell cut the stem of the funnel in 1930, just nine drops have fallen: in December 1938, February 1947, April 1954, May 1962, August 1970, April 1979, July 1988 (when it became a popular exhibit at Brisbane’s generation-defining Expo 1988), November 2000 and April 2014. White prefers to call the pitch drop a demonstration, rather than an experiment, as it has never been controlled, and thus has been subject to environmental fluctuations. For its first 30 years, it sat in a cool dark cupboard. Mainstone put it on display, and the pitch maintained its average of one drop every eight years until, in the 80s, the physics building (which is named after Parnell) was air-conditioned, which blew it out to every 13 years or so. Sometimes, the sensitivity of the pitch to environmental conditions was forgotten. “At one stage, someone swapped the fluorescent lights above the display, which were very cool, to halogens, which are very hot,” White says, shaking his head. “No one asked anyone to change it, it was just done, and I realised that the pitch – which is normally at room temperature – was sitting at 60 degrees. The halogens are about 120, so it was flowing like a tap.” And yet, to this day, no one has seen a drop fall. Not at Expo (White: “There were four or five people watching it, it was a hot day, I think they went out for five minutes to get some cordial”), not even when a live stream was first set up for the millennial event in 2000. Mainstone was watching from London at the time.On that occasion a classic Brisbane thunderstorm disrupted the power supply, cutting the lights and camera feed. Mainstone died of a stroke in 2013. In a cruel twist, the last drop fell in April 2014, a few months after his death. Except, it didn’t technically drop. It just sort of oozed into the eight drops that had already fallen and solidified in the small beaker sitting under the funnel in a bell jar, without breaking away. Reluctantly, White swapped the beaker over, managing to source an old imperial-measurement model to match the original. Since then, the beaker has sat in place – clean, empty, yet to be blackened by a single drop of goo. The lights have been replaced with LEDs. “We had a very fresh start,” White says. “And so, when anyone asks me when it will drop, I can genuinely say that I have no idea. Because the conditions have changed, as they have throughout most of the last 95 years. It’s never been kept constant.” Just a few meters below the pitch drop experiment is a basement dedicated to quantum technology. There, White says, a lab makes pulses of light that are one hundred million billionth of a second long. And here in front of us, he says proudly, “we have something that has an event every 10 to 20 years! It really captures the different timescales of the physical world around us.” He looks at the funnel. There is still quite a bit of pitch in there. The experiment, he says, will long outlive all of us. “Quantum mechanics is as far as you can get from bits of coal that have been heated up and are slowly pouring through a glass tube as you can get,” he says. “I am glad that we got a new beaker in there, that will be good for another 100 years or so. Two, three keepers from now, it’ll be their problem what to do next.”",News/Education,‘It’s literally slower than watching Australia drift north’: the laboratory experiment that will outlive us all,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/30/its-literally-slower-than-watching-australia-drift-north-the-laboratory-experiment-that-will-outlive-us-all

4/30/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is pretending to shop. “Where’s my basket?” he asks, sparking a flurry among advisers to source a shopping basket. A trolley? (Nope, Morrison signals with his eyes.) A branded hessian bag? “Perfect. Let’s go!” “So where’s your turmeric coming from? “Ah Bundaberg. Great.“I prefer using fresh turmeric when I cook.” “I like to cook. That and swimming. It keeps me sane.” Morrison tells Dom at Doblo’s Farmers Market he plans to cook a “veggie curry for the girls” back in Sydney on Saturday night. He adds fresh galangal to the bag. “Can’t have too many of these,” he says of Tasmanian shallots, grabbing a few handfuls. “Where’s the garlic from?” Peru. That gets left on the pile. Onions? Plenty of those at home. “Ah, taro”! He says, as if greeting an old friend. Okra jumps in. Baby eggplants – like the ones “Jen and the girls” grew in Canberra. A pomegranate. A cauliflower. Watching the prime minister winding through the cool rooms, making small talk with owner Dom Doblo, filling his bag with fruit and veg, it’s possible just for a moment to suspend disbelief, imagine for a second that what we are witnessing is real life. But of course, the swarm of cameras, boom mics and reporters that shadow the prime minister’s every move exposes the charade. Morrison is aware of every angle, every interpretation of his campaign event. He curates images and conversations for the consumption of the media pack precisely. He is the star actor, while imagining being the spectator. He is the director of his own show. Despite the best efforts of the cammos, staffers assiduously guide Morrison away from a large statue of a gorilla sitting in a nest of bananas, protecting him from any monkey puns on the evening news. “So this is what you invested with the instant asset write off?” he asks Dom, already knowing the answer, which was included earlier in the campaign brief to reporters. “Well it’s a big fridge. It’s a very big fridge,” Morrison says. “You’d have people just coming here to walk through it in summer – it’s either here or go to the pool!” It’s strange, after two years of pandemic politics, to be reminded of Morrison back in his natural habitat, pressing the flesh with voters, making small talk. Morrison is softer in this embodiment, he smiles and jokes easily. He knows this is his strength as a politician. There are none of the awkward pauses that used to plague Malcolm Turnbull when he attempted to mingle with middle Australia. None of the peculiar Abbott-isms that came before that. No risk of onion-eating here. This is the Morrison machine at its best. Super normal. It’s oddly captivating, the layers of artifice. Will he really cook that okra? I wonder. Pound fresh turmeric for a veggie curry on Saturday night? The bill comes to $52.14. He takes out his credit card and pays. Jumps in a white SUV, and speeds off. This make-believe takes place in the seat of Capricornia, held by the Coalition on a 12.4% margin by Michelle Landry, the incumbent since 2013. The Coalition is feeling comfortable about Queensland. After substantial swings against Labor in 2019, the buffers in the seats north of Brisbane are difficult for Anthony Albanese to overcome at this election. Morrison began the day in Townsville, in the seat of Herbert, held by the nuggety Phil Thompson on an 8.4% margin. When Kevin ‘07 swept John Howard out of office, the seat of Herbert swung 6% towards Labor. Barring any last minute Albomentum, Herbert is not in play. The tour of Doblo’s market is the third campaign stop of the day. “Relentless”, is how one tv journalist who has been captive on the Coalition campaign bus for the past two and a half weeks describes it. “But great pictures”. Most days are the same. A picture opportunity in the morning. A press conference late morning. A change of location and a third stop – usually a manufacturing plant where the hard hats and high vis come out. Guardian Australia jumps on the campaign trail in Townsville, where Morrison has landed after spending Anzac day in Darwin. It is week three of the six-week campaign. The Labor leader Anthony Albanese is in isolation in Sydney with Covid. A ding on the “Scomobile” Whatsapp group advises that the first event on the campaign trail is a visit to the Jean-Pierre wholesale artisan bakery. Morrison rolls croissants, gently sandwiches bright ruby macaron shells together, making small talk with pastry chefs, clapping his hands like a football coach. “That’s how you do it!” At a press conference at the TEi steel fabrication plant, the prime minister stands up to talk about a $60m grant program for business energy efficiency and to announce a hydrogen hub for Townsville. But the prime minister is on the defensive. His first task is to try and tidy up an unwelcome split over the Coalition’s net zero goal after the LNP’s candidate for Flynn, Colin Boyce, suggested there was wriggle room in the commitment. “What he [Boyce] was referring to was our pathway to it and as technologies change and improve, then, of course, we’re going to get there and we’re going to get there by the best method possible.” “It is the government’s absolute policy.” Morrison is also on the back foot over national security, with the government under pressure over whether it has dropped the ball to allow a security pact between China and Solomon Islands to be signed. But Morrison has an answer to everything. On a question on rebuilding trust with Emmanuel Macron, he pivots to the Chinese in the Pacific. Asked question on his remarks that public Icac hearings are a “kangaroo court”, he steers to his rote reply on the integrity commission. The invisible question time folder is always at his fingertips. Morrison has been in cabinet for almost a decade. In 2009, he became opposition spokesperson on immigration – the most challenging portfolio at the time as the country dealt with boat arrivals, and arguably the issue that won them government in 2013. Since that time, he has faced the daily assault of media questioning. He makes no secret of his disdain for most of the press gallery in Canberra, apart from a few friendlies, and feels no need to answer questions he doesn’t like. In the frenzy of campaign press conferences it is even more difficult to pin Morrison down. Only once during this campaign – when the press focus was on the government’s broken promise to establish an integrity commission – has Morrison faced sustained pressure. In The Game, Sean Kelly’s portrait of Scott Morrison, he notes that “one of the truly remarkable facts about Scott Morrison is how few gaffes there have been in his career.” “He makes mistakes, says things that are obviously false, even lies, but rarely does he say something that makes you think that you are suddenly, briefly, getting a glimpse of something you were not meant to see.” Morrison’s campaign has so far been largely mistake-free, even if full of political mistruths and lies. Take the “sneaky carbon tax” which gets a run when Morrison stands up in Rockhampton after having cups of tea with a group of seniors, referring to the safeguard mechanism that the Coalition itself introduced in 2013. Morrison has no compunction. “You have got to scrap to win,” he privately tells colleagues. Despite the national polls pointing to a comfortable Labor win at next month’s election, Morrison displays not a skerrick of self-doubt about the task ahead. He has been in this position before, having told colleagues that he can once again take them on an unlikely path to victory. Bill Shorten at the last election said the Coalition had a “goat track” to win, compared to its freeway. It is even truer this time round, with the government starting behind on 75 seats. It needs 76 for a majority. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I know what the path is and I’ll be following it,” Morrison told MPs in February. “And once again I’m asking you to follow me in going down that path and staying focused on that and only that.” “Do that and we win - it’s that simple.” While the Coalition dares to dream of a second miracle victory under Morrison, the task at this election is far more difficult than in 2019, when the prime minister was being introduced to voters for the first time. This time, Morrison is a known quantity. He has baggage to carry up the track. Across the country, Labor is hammering his record and character, a task made easy by the free character assessments of Morrison offered up by everyone from the then NSW premier to the French president. Labor’s negative campaign has been brought forward, convinced that converting parked votes its way is best achieved by galvanising public anger towards Morrison. But despite the effectiveness of Labor’s message, Coalition strategists insist there is still a path to victory. The logic goes like this: People have already factored in their anger against Morrison, so why haven’t they yet converted their vote to Labor? If they haven’t made up their mind yet, then the parked protest vote is soft. It is in this gap that the Coalition senses opportunity, hammering home the choice between the known and the unknown. “This election is a choice,” Morrison says on repeat. “Between a government that you do know and a Labor opposition that you don’t.” Party strategists also question whether the negative campaign against Morrison has run out of juice. How much lower can Labor’s attack drag the Coalition vote, with it already languishing in the mid 30s? Can community anger be whipped back to where it was at its hottest? Are the baseball bats out for Morrison? In parts of the country, yes. But in the parts that matter? That remains to be seen. “We can win this,” one senior figure says. “It’s not easy, but it’s possible”. The campaign so far has been framed around the Coalition’s traditional core strengths of the economy and national security, but on both of these issues, Morrison has been on the backfoot. In Cairns, at a local shipyard on the banks of Chinaman Creek, Morrison is campaigning with the MP for Leichhardt, former crocodile farmer, Warren Entsch. Morrison is fielding questions on spiking inflation, which has just come in at a 20-year high, undermining the Coalition’s message on strong economic management. But the prime minister seems to relish the opportunity. “Well, look, I’ve been around politics a little while and I’ve also been around the economy a long while,” Morrison starts, before turning to his lines on the risk of a change to Labor. Morrison has two tasks in this campaign. Remind people of his experience. Paint Albanese as a risk. He will do this relentlessly, every day until polling day. This is Entsch’s ninth election. He has contested and won every election in the seat since 1996 - apart from in 2007, when Labor won the seat in his absence. “This is the hardest one to read of all of them,” he tells Guardian Australia. “And that is because of social media, and the hangover from Trump with all the fake news nonsense.” He says he doesn’t sense that baseball bats are out for the government, and insists the reception for Morrison has been positive. But Entsch concedes it will be “tough”. “There is a lot of single issue stuff and a lot of angry people,” Entsch says. There are 11 parties on the Leichhardt ballot paper, and Entsch says they will all drag down his primary vote and likely preference against him. Across the nation, a similar story is heard, with the unprecedented support for independents and other parties the biggest unknown at the coming poll. Compared to previous elections, Entsch says this is the first that he has detected the strong influence of social media on voters. He has had campaign posters defaced with “corruption” graffiti for the first time, had locals yell at him in shopping centres about the “new world order”, and has had countless conversations about fake news. “They think mainstream politicians are corrupt, they think mainstream media is corrupt and they get all their information from the deep, dark abyss of social media. “When I say to them you need to balance out your opinions, look at some reputable news, they come back to me and say ‘social media is my truth’.” Entsch says the election feels a bit like the GST election of 1998, or the Gillard-Abbott contest of 2010 when Australia ended up with a Labor minority government, but hopes as the election draws closer the economic choice will become starker. “You can never know 100%, but I think we are in with a chance.” For Morrison, he is confident that all the ingredients are there for a victory. But will it come together? Or will it remain a figment of imagination, a fantasy left behind on the campaign trail.",News/Australia news,‘The director of his own show’: the PM mingles with middle Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/30/the-director-of-his-own-show-the-pm-mingles-with-middle-australia
4/30/2022,"For tragedy to really tear your heart out, it has to feel preventable. What if Juliet’s messenger had arrived on time? What if Othello had trusted his wife? What if Caesar had just stayed home that day and caught up on the latest papyrus? Watching the brisk, mordant Broadway revival of Macbeth, which stars a muscled, de-Bonded Daniel Craig, you might entertain another what-if: what if medieval Scotland had maximally effective therapy? Sam Gold’s production performed on a seemingly bare stage, designed by Christine Jones and lit, thrillingly – in shocking blues, reds and greens – by Jane Cox. It begins with a precis of attitudes toward early modern witchcraft, delivered, drolly, by Michael Patrick Thornton. An incantation follows. A cast member (Danny Wolohan, later to endure worse) is hung upside down in an inverted cross while other members stir a bubbling pot with suspiciously red contents. Is that smell garlic? Or something more sinister? Still, this swift, savvy Macbeth never winds its charm too tightly; only rarely does it feel unearthly. Instead, Craig’s burly Macbeth, clad handsomely in Suttirat Larlab’s modern dress costumes, is every inch a man of action and a soldier, even in a silky bathrobe, entirely convincing in motion, less persuasive when zipping through Macbeth’s equivocations. If he is in blood stepped in so far, it doesn’t seem to bother him. Any decent castle has maid service. Instead, this Macbeth inhabits a one-man culture of toxic masculinity, prisoner to his vaulting ambition, unable to accept any personal weakness or to enjoy his golden opinions when there is more still to achieve. Infirm of purpose? Please. If this Macbeth could use some time supine on an analyst’s couch, he and Lady Macbeth (a dynamic Ruth Negga) could also use some couples counseling. Negga’s Lady Macbeth is an enabler and an abettor (codependent much?), asking to be unsexed so that she can achieve the masculine ruthlessness that her husband so clearly values. The characters who display more sympathy and fellow feeling – Paul Lazar’s bluff Duncan, Amber Gray’s crystalline Banquo – don’t tend to last long here. The one exception is Grantham Coleman’s upstanding Macduff, who resists the urging of Malcom (Asia Kate Dillon) to man up. “Dispute it like a man,” Malcolm insists. Instead, Macduff insists on making space for his grief and his weakness. “I shall do so,” he says. “But I must also feel it as a man. I cannot but remember such things were, that were most precious to me.” But in contrast to most productions, Macduff’s victory feels less than assured. There’s pleasure to be found here and a dark, macabre wit. The potion that begins the second half has some ghastly ingredients. Poor Wolohan. Gold’s direction is focused and specific, in contrast to his labored King Lear. But there’s something unexamined and underscrutinized in this version. This Macbeth, a man of action, doesn’t change much from the first scene to the last. (His Iago, in Gold’s Othello, had more depth and variety.) Negga’s Lady M transforms, though this happens almost as soon as we meet her. And after the first half, the play mostly shunts her offstage. (Well, to the back of the stage, characters here rarely disappear. Especially dead ones.) There is shock – short, sharp – and surprises and some playful, inventive staging, but little that feels truly risky or dangerous. The conflicts are external, not internal. “It feels good,” Thornton teases in that opening speech, “to cast a little spell”. Yet, despite the charms and potions, there’s not so much magic here.",Arts/Stage,Macbeth review – Daniel Craig and Ruth Negga soar but there’s magic missing,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/29/macbeth-review-daniel-craig-ruth-negga
4/30/2022,"When the Australian election was finally called, I was not in Perth, where I live. Instead, I was sitting in a cafe with a friend in Johannesburg, talking about politics. I was finally home after a hard border closure that saw Western Australia shut itself off from the world for 697 days. I was disappointed not to be there, because during election season Australians throw off their normal aversion to talking about politics. It was one of the first things I noticed about Australia when I moved here. There is a profound reticence on the part of many people to sharing political opinions. In conversation after conversation, Australians are happy to talk about their disdain for politicians, but few are prepared to say what they think about matters they deem to be political – and certainly many people shrink from talking about party political views. Indeed, whether you like him or not, it is this reticence Scott Morrison is speaking to when he references “quiet Australians”. He is alluding to that part of the Australian political identity that values keeping your head down and your politics close to your chest. Those who talk openly about their political views are not “true blue Aussies”. The outspoken are “woke” outsiders, people who go against the grain of the silent majority. In this view of the world, keeping your politics to yourself is a bonus; a sign of authentic Australian-ness. In South Africa of course, the opposite is true. Here, politics is discussed at the drop of a hat. And yes, South Africa’s politicians are among the most corrupt and broken people in the world, but ordinary citizens continue to be deeply engaged in political debate. Politics is stitched into the fabric of everyday life. Every day I have been back in Johannesburg, I have driven past a young man, who begs on a particular corner. Most days, he holds a cup for coins and a sign that reads: “PUTIN MONEY, I PROMISE TO SHARE WITH UKRAINE”. The pun is both hilarious and sad. Thirty years after the end of apartheid, it is a testament to a politically audacious strain in the South African personality; an insistence that everyone has a right to voice their opinion. It speaks also, to South African’s willingness to discuss hard topics without flinching. I had forgotten how much I admire this about the country, and how absent this trait is in quotidian Australian life. It may seem counterintuitive – after all rich countries are supposed to teach poor countries how to behave – but as Australia races towards a generation-defining election, the continent at the edge of the world would do well to consider a few lessons from one of the most vibrant democracies on the planet. South Africans are outspoken about their views, and are committed to robust and often deeply uncomfortable conversations. The result is that people are often far more capable of expressing themselves in political terms than they are in Australia. There is a fearlessness about daily conversations in South Africa that has helped me to think more deeply – and with greater urgency – about politics. For example, a week after arriving, I found myself deep in conversation with a friend who was criticising the leadership of the country’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa. He argued that Ramaphosa is timid and suggested that he has failed to “grasp his historical mandate”. The notion of a “historical mandate” was both delightful and intriguing; precisely the kind of grandiose phrase South Africans bandy about in daily life. I pushed him to explain further and he did. He contended that after a disastrous decade of corruption and mismanagement under Jacob Zuma, Ramaphosa had won the election by carrying the expectations of a weary nation on his shoulders. His task was to rebuild the ANC after nine years of neglect and malfeasance. Instead, my friend argued, the president had squandered the opportunity, in large part because he didn’t understand that he had a mission that was about the times in which he was living, rather than being about any particular ambitions he may have had for himself. It’s an argument that has a lot of merit. Mandela had a historical mission, which was to unite a divided nation. There is now widespread recognition in the country that while Mandela was a special man, he also managed the transition to democracy by navigating the political externalities of the times – the end of communism, the effectiveness of sanctions and the success of domestic pressure on the apartheid regime – and rising to the occasion. The Australian context may be different, but the country faces a similarly significant leadership crisis. The country’s leaders must also rise to the occasion after a wasted decade. Under the Coalition, Australia has been left behind on every defining issue of the millennium – from climate change to race relations to refugee rights and workers’ rights. The increasingly rightwing policies of the Liberal Party have facilitated a politics that is both small-minded and mean-spirited. As a result, Australia finds itself in the unenviable position of having plenty of wealth and no vision. In the coming years, the country faces more bushfires and floods, more drought and extreme weather events, and yet in playgrounds and sports fields around the country, in the next few weeks, people will nod and smile at one another and avoid the kinds of robust conversations that are necessary in momentous times. This will not do: if everyday Aussies can learn anything from South Africa it is that they dare not be silent. They must care more about their futures than they do about maintaining an appearance of political propriety. Scott Morrison is no Mandela, nor is Anthony Albanese, but the stakes of this election are incredibly high. Whoever wins at the polls be entrusted with a historical mandate they dare not betray.",Opinion/Opinion,"Australia, we need to talk about politics: history beckons at this election, and keeping your head down just won’t do",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/30/australia-we-need-to-talk-about-politics-history-beckons-at-this-election-and-keeping-your-head-down-just-wont-do
4/30/2022,"The new chief executive of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, Andrew McConville, has caused consternation after sending an all-staff memo outlining his approach to the job which failed to mention the regulator’s environmental role. A former chief executive of the Australian Petroleum Producers & Exporters Association (APPEA), McConville was appointed to the top job at the MDBA by the Morrison government just days before the federal election was called. He is not due to start until June but recently posted a letter introducing himself to staff and explaining his approach to the job. “I am absolutely thrilled and delighted to have been appointed the chief executive,” he said. “I have a real passion for Australian agriculture and for regional and rural Australia. “This is not an appointment or responsibility I take lightly. The work that you do is important and in the national interest.” The email made no mention of the environmental challenges facing the Murray-Darling Basin, climate change or other stakeholders such as First Nations people, who have been advocating for rights to cultural flows. The omission has worried many MDBA staff – particularly those who work on the environmental side of the organisation. McConville told staff he grew up in Armidale, got an agricultural economics degree at the University of New England and has a master’s of science from Oxford, “where I probably played too much rugby but managed to pass the time”. He said that he spent much of his career in agriculture, focused on building productivity and resilient communities and enterprises “through collaboration with strong relationships, a commitment to sustainability and the sensible use of technology”. McConville said he “had at least a little bit of water in my veins” as he was one of the architects of Victoria’s water trading scheme in the 1990s. He also mentioned his experience at the Australian Wheat Board and at Syngenta – a large agricultural chemicals and seed business – as well as his time at APPEA. “Water management is a complex and contested space with many stakeholders often with competing views,” he said. “Managing stakeholders is something I am passionate about. I have had some tough ones over the years: opponents and proponents of single desk marketing [of wheat] … pesticides and GMOs against organics, and fossil fuels in a net zero world. So how hard can it be, right!?” McConville acknowledged he had a lot to learn and said he wanted staff to share their advice and deep knowledge of the critical river system. A number of staff have raised their concerns about the letter and McConville’s emphasis on agricultural outcomes internally – as well as with Guardian Australia. The MDBA was established under the Water Act 2007 to address historic overallocation of water in the Murray-Darling Basin to agriculture and restore the environmental health of the river. It is now in the final stages of implementing the $13bn plan which is still well short of returning 2,750 gigalitres of water – the amount that states and the commonwealth agreed was the minimum required to ensure a sustainable river system. This figure is seen as inadequate by most environmental scientists. The Act says the MDBA is “to promote the use and management of the basin water resources in a way that optimises economic, social and environmental outcomes” and “to ensure the return to environmentally sustainable levels of extraction for water resources that are over-allocated or overused”. It is also charged with ensuring Australia meets its international obligations to protect several wetlands under the Ramsar treaty arrangements. In undertaking its task it must use the best available science to guide its decision making. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who has taken a deep interest in the Murray-Darling Basin plan, said McConville’s first letter to staff had confirmed fears about the appointment. “Putting an oil and gas lobbyist, from Queensland, in charge of Australia’s most important river system is obscene,” Hanson-Young said. “This email introducing himself to the authority’s staff exposes the worst fears of downstream communities and those who care deeply about the health of the river. “In a rambling, two-page, self-congratulatory memo to staff, not once did Mr McConville even mention the environment. The whole point of the MDBA is to keep the river alive and flowing, yet the new boss displays total ignorance to the needs of the environment and water security impacts of the climate crisis. “The tone-deaf memo is a warning sign of more pain for river. With the Murray-Darling Basin plan failing to deliver the promised and needed environmental flows to South Australia, it is alarming that the guy in charge seems more interested in appeasing corporate irrigators than looking after the environment.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Asked about the memo, McConville said there has been a great deal of interest in his appointment, which was understandable since he had come from outside government and the water, environment and agriculture sectors. “First and foremost my job will always be to run an independent, statutory agency to deliver its remit,” he said. “This also means listening, understanding and working collaboratively with a range of people. In doing that the goal must absolutely be a healthy and sustainable river system because we all benefit from this, it is what all Australians need and expect.” McConville confirmed he knew the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, from university days. Both attended UNE. “We played rugby against each other at opposing colleges some 30 years ago,” McConville said. “Since his entering politics, I have engaged with Barnaby occasionally, as I would and do with a wide range of MPs across the political spectrum. “My relationship is not personal and is no different to any political connection I have on all sides of politics.” In Senate estimates in April, the secretary of the agriculture, water and environment department, Andrew Metcalfe, said McConville was one of three candidates whose names were ultimately sent to the minister for a decision, which was then ratified by cabinet. A total of 19 applications were received and a further five were identified by headhunters. McConville was one of the applicants for the $443,000 a year job. “The panel was very satisfied as to all three candidates,” Metcalfe told estimates. “Mr McConville is certainly someone that we regarded as being a very outstanding candidate.”",News/Australia news,New Murray-Darling Basin Authority boss fails to mention environment in all-staff memo,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/30/new-murray-darling-basin-authority-boss-fails-to-mention-environment-in-all-staff-memo
4/30/2022,"A Metropolitan police officer accused of grievous bodily harm after a black man was left paralysed from the chest down has been named after losing a bid to keep his name from the public domain. Imran Mahmood, 35, was charged with grievous bodily harm on 31 March and had sought anonymity from Westminster magistrates court after expressing concern of Jordan Walker-Brown’s alleged links to criminal gangs, according to the PA news agency, which sought submission of the officer’s name alongside other media organisations. Jordan Walker-Brown, 25, was left with life-changing injuries after he was shot with a Taser and fell from a wall in Haringey, north London, while being pursued by police in May 2020. He initially said he believed he was targeted because he is a black man. Dismissing the application for anonymity, the chief magistrate Paul Goldspring described the risk as “speculative” and said it is “a quantum leap from the fact that it can happen, to cogent evidence that such an imminent threat exists in this case”. Goldspring added: “The police habitually manage such risks in the community by a variety of measures, which may well be appropriate in the present case, but anonymity is not justified.” Appearing in court by video, Mahmood of Plaistow, east London, indicated a non-guilty plea in his last court appearance on Thursday. The constable was released on bail and will appear at Southwark crown court on 26 May. Mahmood was charged in March after the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) referred a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service. According to official figures, black people are five times more likely to have force used against them by police in England and Wales than white people. Nearly 7,000 Met officers carry Taser stun guns, with numbers expected to rise to 10,000 by 2022.

4/30/2022,"Why are they in this predicament? The injuries which, for much of the season, deprived Leeds of last season’s leading scorer, Patrick Bamford, their England defensive midfielder Kalvin Phillips and their captain and key centre-half, Liam Cooper, fractured the team’s spine, impacting results adversely. Marcelo Bielsa performed wonders at Elland Road but things had started to unravel under the Argentinian this season and his replacement with the impressive Jesse Marsch on 1 March arguably came slightly too late. Although Marsch has praised Bielsa he has suggested that the intensity of his predecessor’s training regime prompted a “myriad of injuries” allied to physical and mental burnout. Moreover Bielsa’s often gung-ho, high-risk, gameplans led to to the concession of an awful lot of goals. How likely do they look to stay up? Leeds nurse a significantly worse goal difference than Burnley and Everton and face the most formidable-looking final fixtures. Conversely they do have the most points in the bag and appear revitalised under Marsch’s tactically and emotionally intelligent leadership. They also possess Raphinha’s right-wing brilliance, have Phillips and Cooper fit again and remain optimistic that Bamford, by far their most incisive striker, will return for at least the two final games. Which players are key to their chances? Bamford: it is no exaggeration to say his reintroduction to attack could be the difference between survival and relegation. Mentions also for Illan Meslier, outstanding in goal this season, Phillips, who offers much-needed midfield control, and Raphinha, on his day an unplayable winger and the creator of so many chances. Louise Taylor Writer’s prediction 20th Norwich, 19th Watford, 18th Everton Remaining fixtures Sat Manchester City (h), 8 May Arsenal (a), 11 May Chelsea (h), 15 May Brighton (h), 22 May Brentford (a) Why are they in this predicament? Sean Dyche’s tried and trusted methods no longer energised the team. The relationship between players and coaching staff had broken down. The former manager was sacked in mid-April, days after a dismal away defeat by the bottom club Norwich, with the team set for the drop after four wins in 30 games. How likely do they look to stay up? Since the departure of Dyche, Burnley have collected seven points in three matches under the stewardship of the caretaker Mike Jackson and his backroom staff, including the captain, Ben Mee. They have looked revitalised, playing a brand of football not witnessed in the past decade; Burnley attack and allow players to express themselves in a manner that would have resulted in a growl from the technical area under Dyche. Which players are key to their chances? The defence has always been steady and remains rigid. In the final third, however, things need to come to life. Dwight McNeil has found form under Jackson and looks to be enjoying his football after a tough spell that has brought him one assist all season. He is looking like the player who burst into the Premier League with his ability to go either way and provide sublime delivery from either flank. Wout Weghorst will be hoping to make the most of this upsurge in productivity from McNeil – the Dutchman has two goals in 15 matches since joining from Wolfsburg in January. Will Unwin Writer’s prediction 20th Norwich, 19th Watford, 18th Everton Remaining fixtures Sat Watford (a), 7 May Aston Villa (h), 15 May Tottenham (a), 19 May Aston Villa (a), 22 May Newcastle (h) Why are they in this predicament? Six years of appalling mismanagement by Farhad Moshiri and the board – that includes, but is not limited to, woeful and extravagant recruitment, a scattergun managerial policy, huge losses and no clear or intelligent football vision – has not only cost Everton their long-coveted chance to close the gap on the Premier League elite but imperilled their 68-year residence in the top flight. To do so having spent about £600m on signings in the Moshiri era – one of the highest outlays in European football in that period – defies belief as well as business logic. After a good start to the season, injuries to several key players sent a mishmash of a team into a tailspin under Rafael Benítez from which they have yet to recover. How likely do they look to stay up? The table, fixture list and Everton’s atrocious away form point towards a first relegation since 1951 yet there are signs that all is not lost under Frank Lampard. There has been no great managerial bounce in terms of results under Lampard, who has won 10 points from 12 league games (the 14 games before he arrived yielded six points), but performance levels at Goodison Park have undoubtedly improved. The three remaining home fixtures, against Chelsea, Brentford and Crystal Palace, are must-wins. Which players are key to their chances? Anthony Gordon has been the one consistent light this season and, given Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s injury problems, Lampard needs more goals and assists from the 21-year-old and from Richarlison. Alex Iwobi has stepped up impressively under the new manager. Andy Hunter Writer’s prediction 20th Norwich, 19th Watford, 18th Burnley Remaining fixtures Sun Chelsea (h), 8 May Leicester (a), 11 May Watford (a), 15 May Brentford (h), 19 May Crystal Palace (h), 22 May Arsenal (a) Why are they in this predicament? A record run of 10 successive home defeats in the Premier League that started after November’s 4-1 thrashing of Manchester United has virtually extinguished any chance of survival, with Roy Hodgson yet to pick up a point at Vicarage Road since succeeding Claudio Ranieri in January. It all looked so different on the first day of the season when Xisco Muñoz’s side saw off Aston Villa 3-0 but the Spaniard went the way of so many of his predecessors despite a decent start and neither Ranieri nor Hodgson has been able to instigate a revival. How likely do they look to stay up? Watford must beat Burnley at home on Saturday to keep alive their faint hopes of avoiding the drop. They then face a trip to Hodgson’s former club Crystal Palace before facing Everton and Leicester at Vicarage Road and cannot afford to slip up in any of those either – especially with a daunting final fixture at Chelsea. Hodgson masterminded Fulham’s great escape at the end of the 2007-08 season with a a run of 12 points from the last five games, including a 3–2 win over Manchester City after being 2–0 down with 20 minutes remaining, so perhaps he has one last trick up his sleeve. Which players are key to their chances? Ismaïla Sarr has struggled to find consistency but the Senegal forward, courted by Manchester United last year, is capable of inspiring match-winning performances, and Emmanuel Dennis looks back in form after a difficult few months. Ed Aarons Prediction 20th Norwich, 19th Watford, 18th Everton Remaining fixtures Sat Burnley (h), 7 May Crystal Palace (a), 11 May Everton (h), 15 May Leicester (h), 22 May Chelsea (a) Why are they in this predicament? Not good enough in either box. That’s the line from both managers this season – Daniel Farke and Dean Smith – although the truth is that they’re not much good in the middle either. A lack of quality and belief has been all too apparent for the vast majority of the season, but a lack of physical capability is the primary failing that has left them unable to compete at this level. How likely do they look to stay up? They could go down this weekend if results go against Norwich at Villa Park and elsewhere. Even if that doesn’t come to pass their demise surely remains inevitable. There is also an issue of increasing disquiet among the fanbase, which is hardly likely to gee anyone up for a shot at a miracle. Which players are key to their chances? Arguably only two players squad have lived up to the challenge this season. Teemu Pukki has 10 Premier League goals, from an average of 1.77 shots per game (82nd in the league and fewer than Marcos Alonso). Not only has he made the most of meagre service, he’s been doing some of the most intensive work off the ball too, conducting 605 defensive pressures, the fifth most in the league according to Fbref.com. The club captain, Grant Hanley, has also delivered. He is third in the league for clearances and eighth for blocks, with the Scot putting himself on the line effectively whenever he has played. The same, sadly, cannot be said for the rest.

4/30/2022,"There is a photo on a boardroom wall at Edgeley Park depicting Stockport’s 1997 League Cup semi-final first leg against Middlesbrough. Almost 12,000 fans packed into the stadium that night to watch second-tier County and it is an image that is helping to inspire their hoped-for return to the Football League. A lot has happened in 25 years but crucially Stockport are four points clear of second-placed Wrexham with a game in hand and could secure promotion over the bank holiday long weekend. But for the more high-profile investment from Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney in north Wales, Stockport might already be popping the corks. The local businessman Mark Stott bought the National League club in January 2020 with the aim of taking them back to the Championship. Covid curtailed his first season and the second ended with defeat in the playoffs but Stockport are close to playing again in League Two, from which they were relegated in 2011. One of Stott’s first appointments was the director of football, Simon Wilson, to help implement an ambitious seven-year plan to reach the Championship. Wilson arrived after spells at Manchester City and Sunderland and a period as a consultant, including providing advice to Stott about purchasing Stockport. “There were natural things you would find with a part-time, underfunded football club,” Wilson says at Stott’s offices in Cheshire. “They didn’t have enough people, they didn’t have the right facilities, couldn’t think further than a week or two in advance so proper planning couldn’t be done. A lot of that comes down to finance – it’s cold and matter of fact. I know Ralf Rangnick has come out with a lot of phrases but I do agree with the three Cs: concept, competence and capital. You need enough of it to start to build things.” Wilson’s links to City helped Stockport, despite interest from Salford City, acquire the Premier League champions’ former training ground at Carrington after Bury were liquidated. Stockport still needed to invest in the facilities because Bury had failed to maintain them, leading to damp and mould in the dressing rooms. “We have often talked about not waiting until the Championship to become a Championship club,” Wilson says. “We wanted to operate like a Championship club from day one and slowly improve the team, and it will also help improve the team by operating at a high level.” The wilderness years saw Stockport drop to National League North for six years and become part-time. There were defeats by Vauxhall Motors, Alfreton and Rushall Olympic as the club struggled to find a way out of a downward spiral. Yet season-ticket numbers never dropped below 1,000, a sign of the potential. Local rivalries were formed against FC United of Manchester and Curzon Ashton in the sixth tier. It was a long way from League Cup semi-finals and beating Manchester City 2-1 in 2002 at Edgeley Park. One of the players that night was Dave Challinor, who returned as manager in November with “unfinished business”. Stockport convinced him to leave Hartlepool in the division above. Challinor’s Hartlepool had defeated Stockport in the playoffs on the way to promotion last season. “It was a really difficult decision because I’d worked so hard to get to the Football League,” says Challinor. “I’d been working for 10 years to get that opportunity and the reality of it was that things were going quite well. Whenever you’re approached about jobs, you’ve always got to look at the present and then quickly make a decision whether it suits you further down the line.” Twenty wins in Challinor’s first 23 league games in charge have taken the team from 10th to first. “I would not have come here if I did not think there was the opportunity to get promoted this year; that would have been daft,” Challinor says in his training-ground office. “I felt there was the opportunity to do that. There was three-quarters of the season to go, still a lot of games and points to play for. If on my first day here I’d been offered a playoff place, I’d have been daft not to take it; if I’d been offered a top-three place, I would have been jumping all over it. The run of wins we put together has given us a really good opportunity to go up as champions. These opportunities don’t come round an awful lot so we need to maximise that and do everything we can to get over the line.” Last November 10,084 were at Edgeley Park to see Stockport dump League One Bolton out of the FA Cup, with an atmosphere reminiscent of 25 years ago. The ground is key to the long-term thinking, with the club acquiring a 250-year lease and planning to expand. Stockport are unapologetic about their spending; the striker Paddy Madden was signed for £150,000 in March 2021 from League One Fleetwood. A first promotion under Stott, Wilson and Challinor would make building the foundations worthwhile. “The potential of the football club is to be a top-end League One club and potentially push back to where it was 20 years ago in the Championship,” says Challinor. “This is the hardest league to get out of. If you carry more funding, momentum, a winning team and mentality into a division where there are three automatic promotion places and playoff spots, there is a good opportunity to kick on and go again.

4/30/2022,"Who is behind the consortium? The group’s move came when the 86-year-old Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss went public with his interest in buying Chelsea from Roman Abramovich. Wyss said he was working with other investors and it soon transpired that the figure fronting the bid was Todd Boehly, an American who part-owns the LA Dodgers baseball team. Boehly, who co-founded Eldridge Industries, is worth an estimated $4.5bn and his interest in Chelsea has not come out of nowhere: he had a bid rejected by Abramovich in 2019. Nothing has been left to chance this time and Boehly has been chosen as the preferred bidder for Chelsea despite a late bid from Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Investors include Jonathan Goldstein, a British businessman who is the CEO of Cain International and a Tottenham fan, and Boehly’s fellow Dodgers owner Mark Walter. There is also backing from the US investment firm Clearlake Capital. Daniel Finkelstein, a Tory peer and Times columnist, and Barbara Charone, a celebrity publicist, will become non-executive directors if the deal goes through. The consortium has received advice from Robey Warshaw, where the former chancellor George Osborne works. It is anticipated that Boehly would be the most influential figure in the running of Chelsea, with Wyss more in the background. Boehly has a long history of working with Goldstein, a lawyer who has been a major player in the property world, and with Walter. What has Boehly done at the Dodgers? It seemed that Stan Kroenke was going to buy the Dodgers for £900m 10 years ago, only for Boehly’s group to stun the Arsenal owner by bidding £1.3bn for the franchise. It was a huge statement of intent and Boehly, who studied at the London School of Economics and is a part-owner of the Los Angeles Sparks women’s basketball team, has since shown plenty of ambition. There has been steady investment in the Dodgers and they claimed the World Series in 2020, which suggests that Boehly would be focused on winning at Chelsea. Are there any potential hitches? The emergence of interest from Ratcliffe throws up the possibility of a late U-turn by Abramovich. No other bidders remain in the running. None of the investors in the Boehly consortium have stakes in rival football clubs and there are no political controversies attached to the bid. Will the approach be different from Abramovich’s? Do not expect Boehly’s group to protect Chelsea’s position by giving them £1.5bn in loans. There is likely to be a desire to make the club self-sufficient and the days of spending £200m on signings in one summer could be over, although that does not necessarily mean that Chelsea will no longer be able to challenge for major honours. They have become one of the biggest brands in the world and could arguably do with a different approach off the pitch. A ruthless culture of hiring and firing managers has been the norm under Abramovich, but the new hierarchy should be looking to build around Thomas Tuchel and give him more control over recruitment. This could be good for the German. Tuchel has enjoyed working with the influential director, Marina Granovskaia, and the technical and performance adviser, Petr Cech, who should stay, but change in the boardroom could make him even more powerful. Are there plans to renovate Stamford Bridge? This will be key to boosting Chelsea’s finances. Stamford Bridge has a 42,000 capacity and is smaller than Arsenal’s, Tottenham’s and West Ham’s grounds. A stand-by-stand renovation is one possible solution. Moving would be fraught with difficulties because the freehold is held by the non-profit plc, Chelsea Pitch Owners (CPO). Will there be supporter engagement? All bidders have had to engage in dialogue with the CPO and the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust, but it remains to be seen if there will be a golden share for fans. What issues need to be resolved? The new owners will need to provide Tuchel with funds to the plug the gaps in his defence. Antonio Rüdiger has decided to join Real Madrid on a free and Barcelona are expected to sign Andreas Christensen when the Denmark centre-back’s contract expires at the end of the season. Barça also retain an interest in César Azpilicueta, who could be allowed to leave despite Chelsea triggering an automatic one-year extension in their captain’s deal. The upheaval could leave Tuchel with Thiago Silva, Malang Sarr and Trevoh Chalobah as his only senior centre-backs. Levi Colwill could step up after a fine loan spell at Huddersfield but more experience is required. Are there problems in other positions? The owners will need to get to work quickly. They must start negotiations with Mason Mount, whose deal runs out in two years, and consider whether alterations are required in midfield. Decisions will need to be made over N’Golo Kanté and Jorginho, with both midfielders out of contract next year. Is now the time to sell one of them given that Conor Gallagher is returning from his loan at Crystal Palace? As for the attack, Chelsea must also decide whether to cut their losses on Romelu Lukaku. The striker has not settled since his £97.5m move from Internazionale last summer and does not appear to suit Tuchel’s style. Will they be active in the transfer market? Chelsea will need to replace Christensen and Rüdiger, and are likely to revive their interest in Sevilla’s Jules Koundé. Leicester’s Wesley Fofana and RB Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol are also being monitored, and Atlético Madrid’s José Giménez has been targeted in the past. There is an opportunity to freshen up the squad. West Ham’s Declan Rice remains a target in midfield, though Monaco’s Aurélien Tchouaméni would be easier to buy. Similarly the Lille forward Jonathan David could be more affordable than Benfica’s Darwin Núñez, although incomings in attack could depend on sales. There are doubts over Lukaku, Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech.",Sport/Football,Who are Chelsea’s prospective new owners and what issues do they face?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/who-are-chelsea-prospective-new-owners-boehly-and-what-issues-do-they-face-abramovich
4/30/2022,"The number of children in the UK suffering from severe hepatitis has risen to 145 as concerns mount about the mysterious surge in cases. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) announced an increase of 34 cases but said most children have recovered and no children have died. There has been no increase from the 10 children who have required a liver transplant, reported on Monday. Scientists believe there could be a link to adenovirus infection, which has been detected in the majority of cases, but are continuing to investigate the cause. Hepatitis is not a common side-effect from adenovirus, which typically causes cold-like symptoms and nausea, so scientists are investigating whether a co-infection, including with Covid-19, or non-infectious causes such as food poisoning, drug or metal exposure, could be playing a role. “We are also exploring whether increased susceptibility due to reduced exposure during the Covid pandemic could be playing a role, or if there has been a change in the genome of the adenovirus,” UKHSA said in a statement. Dr Meera Chand, the agency’s director of clinical and emerging infections, said: “We know that this may be a concerning time for parents of young children. The likelihood of your child developing hepatitis is extremely low. However, we continue to remind parents to be alert to the signs of hepatitis – particularly jaundice, which is easiest to spot as a yellow tinge in the whites of the eyes – and contact your doctor if you are concerned.” Prof Deirdre Kelly, a paediatric hepatologist at Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS trust and part of a group working with UKHSA to investigate the cases, said that the surge seemed likely to be related to the pandemic and that the group had found a medical report from 1924 describing an increase in child hepatitis after the 1918 influenza pandemic. “They also had a surge in hepatitis, which is fascinating,” Kelly said. She added that the far higher numbers of cases seen in the UK compared with Europe was likely to be due to a better reporting system. The UK has centralised liver treatment centres, meaning that milder cases could be picked up quickly. Chand advised parents to ensure that children follow normal hygiene measures including thorough handwashing. “As always, children experiencing symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea should stay at home and not return to school or nursery until 48 hours after the symptoms have stopped,” she said.",News/Society,Number of UK children suffering from hepatitis rises to 145 ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/29/number-of-uk-children-suffering-from-hepatitis-rises-to-145
4/30/2022,"Donald Trump has been mocked for fearing protesters would throw “dangerous” fruit at him, with late-night talkshow host Trevor Noah calling it “one of the most crazy defenses I’ve ever heard”. The revelation came during the former president’s testimony to attorneys representing a group of protesters suing over their violent removal from a Trump campaign rally in 2015. According to the transcript of the deposition, when asked about his statement to the crowd that “If you see someone getting ready to throw a tomato, just knock the crap out of them, would you,” Trump replied: “It’s very dangerous stuff. You can get killed with those things. “We were threatened,” the president added. “They were going to throw fruit. We were threatened. We had a threat. Trump also said: “I wanted to have people be ready because we were put on alert that they were going to do fruit.” “What do you mean ‘do fruit’?” said Late Night host Seth Meyers on Thursday’s episode. “What do you mean you were put on alert? There’s an alert system for fruit? It’s like the homeland security threat level? Red’s tomato, yellow is for banana and green is for avocado. “You know what they say,” Meyers added, “if you get hit with an avocado, you’re toast.” Trump claimed in the deposition that he became aware of the threat of being beaned by a tomato because the Secret Service warned him: “We were told. I thought Secret Service was involved in that, actually. And you get hit with fruit, it’s very violent stuff. Tomato, when they start doing that stuff, it’s very dangerous. There was an alert out that day.” Perhaps aware of the potentially serious consequences of admitting he had intended security staff or other rally attendees to commit violence, Trump insisted his “knock the crap out them, would you” comment was a joke. “It was said sort of in jest. But maybe, you know, a little truth to it. I wanted to have people be ready because we were put on alert that they were going to do fruit. And some fruit is a lot worse than … tomatoes are bad by the way. But it’s very dangerous … they were going to hit very hard.” The videotaped deposition took place in New York’s Bronx county in October 2021.

4/30/2022,"After days of speculation following Emma Raducanu around the grounds of the Caja Mágica, this time about the merits of her unusual perspective on coaching in light of her decision to part ways with her coach Torben Beltz after five months, the 19-year-old’s clay-court education resumed with an excellent win on her Madrid Open debut. Having trailed 2-5 in the opening set then twice standing set point down, Raducanu showcased her adaptability and mental fortitude as she methodically turned the match on its head, eventually registering a convincing 7-6 (3), 6-0 win over Tereza Martincova to reach the second round. The match-up was a second meeting between the pair this month, with Raducanu pulling off a gritty win against Martincova in her first professional match on clay at the Billie Jean King Cup. But while the faster conditions at altitude in Madrid are preferential for Raducanu, they also suited Martincova. The Czech served extremely well, imposed consistent pressure on Raducanu with her forehand and she was extremely clean for most of the opening set. But not all of it. As in Prague, Raducanu produced her best tennis when she most needed it. This time, she completely changed her approach under pressure. Not only did she begin to load up her shots with more top-spin, adding margin into her game, moving further behind the baseline and eliciting errors from Martincova with her consistency, she also embraced the clay with her offensive game. Having started the match attacking inside the baseline, looking to change directions down the line, essentially playing as if on a hard court, Raducanu began to work the points with width and angle, slowly dragging Martincova off the court. In the attritional rallies that followed, Raducanu’s greater athleticism was so often the difference late in the exchanges. Across the net, all opposition quickly crumbled. After saving the set points, levelling the opening set at 5-5 and then harnessing her momentum into an excellent tie-break, Raducanu ran with the match, winning 11 of the last 12 games to seal victory.Such a thoughtful performance was an apt demonstration of why Raducanu is so confident in her ability to read and understand the game, and why she does not think she needs a prominent coach to guide her at all times. It was also a glimpse into how she might adapt her game to find consistent success on clay in the future as her experience grows on the surface. Raducanu will next face Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine, a fellow 19-year-old she grew up playing against as a junior. “All throughout juniors she was always the favourite when we played. She was considered much better,” said Raducanu. “Yeah, it’s a funny one. When we played last year she played very good, but also I wasn’t very well that day. So it’ll be an interesting match-up.” Meanwhile, Naomi Osaka returned to clay with a promising victory as she recovered from a break down to comfortably defeat Anastasia Potapova 6-3, 6-1. In the men’s event, which begins on Sunday, Andy Murray has been dealt a fascinating first-round draw against former US Open champion Dominic Thiem. While Murray is a surprise wildcard entrant in Madrid after initially planning to skip the entire clay court season, Thiem is returning to tennis after a disastrous year stemming from a serious wrist injury then numerous setbacks. He is yet to win a match after three tournaments back.",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu enjoys straight-sets win over Tereza Martincova,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/29/emma-raducanu-enjoys-straight-sets-win-over-tereza-martincova
4/30/2022,"A senior Conservative MP is under investigation for watching pornography in the House of Commons after furious female colleagues forced government whips to act. Neil Parish, the MP for Tiverton and Honiton, had the whip suspended after becoming the fourth MP from his party since the last election to face claims of impropriety. Parish revealed he had referred himself to the standards commissioner on Friday afternoon after senior Tory women expressed outrage at the party for failing to act on complaints made earlier this week despite being aware of his identity. In a statement, the 65-year-old MP said he would be “cooperating fully with any investigation”. He later told reporters that he may have accidentally opened a pornographic video in the Commons and said he will quit as an MP if found guilty. The Tory whips had refused to suspend the party whip for more than 48 hours after a female minister and parliamentary aide identified Parish on Tuesday night as the MP they allegedly saw watching pornography in the chamber. The whips suggested the female MPs should instead make complaints to the parliamentary watchdog, the Independent Complaints and Grievance Service (ICGS), which is now also investigating. Sue Parish, the MP’s wife, told the Times the accusations were “all very embarrassing”, adding: “My breath was taken away, frankly. “People shouldn’t be looking at pornography. He would never just sit there with people looking. He would never just do that knowing [people were looking]. These ladies were quite right to be as [upset] as they were. Describing her husband as a “normal … lovely person”, she added: “If you were mad with every man who looked at pornography, you would not have many wives in the world. “It’s degrading. It’s demeaning. But on the other hand it takes two to tango. There must be women posing for all this. When asked what the accusations could mean for her husband’s career, she replied: “I’ve got no idea. It depends on what Chris Heaton-Harris [the Tory chief whip] says, I suppose. I don’t think it’s going to carry on, is it? It’s so stupid. He’s such a good MP. He’s such a good person.” Labour accused the Tory whips of trying to “cover up” for Parish before they ultimately took the decision to withdraw the whip on Friday. If found to have brought the Commons into disrepute, Parish could be sanctioned and ultimately face the possibility of a recall petition, potentially triggering a byelection, if suspended from parliament for more than 10 days. He could also face similar penalties through the ICGS, which can look at cases of sexual harassment. The House of Commons would need to authorise the most severe sanctions of suspension or expulsion. With dismay among female MPs about the scale of sexism and misogyny in parliament, Boris Johnson is now facing calls from women within his party to take their concerns more seriously. One Conservative peer described a “toxic mix of stress, and booze and testosterone and power” that was difficult to tackle. It comes less than a week after the whips said they would take steps to identify which anonymous Tory MP was responsible for accusing Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, of crossing and uncrossing her legs in parliament in order to distract him. The story in the Mail on Sunday prompted widespread anger. One Tory MP and former cabinet minister said she thought Parish should have been “suspended with immediate effect” and referred to the standards system by the whips, adding that she had personally urged them to do so. Another Conservative MP described the reaction of the whips as “useless” and said their inadequate response was typical of their failure to take women in the party seriously. They also said a culture of failing to tackle misogyny had “come from the top” and was ultimately the responsibility of the prime minister. Harriet Harman told the BBC Radio 4 PM programme that Parish should stand down as an MP. “This marks a new low for the House of Commons,” the senior Labour MP said. “If this is what he has done, he should stand down from parliament right away. It is not right for him to go through the investigation processes if that is what he has done. Clearly he is not fit to be in parliament. He should accept that and not drag the processes out.” Johnson had responded to the alleged porn-watching by saying it was “obviously unacceptable for anybody to be doing that kind of thing in the workplace”. A spokesperson for the chief whip, Chris Heaton-Harris, said Parish was reporting himself to the parliamentary authorities. “Mr Parish has been suspended from the Conservative whip pending the outcome of that investigation,” the spokesperson said. The standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, can investigate whether MPs have complied with the House of Commons code of conduct. Paragraph 15 of the code says MPs must “conduct themselves in a manner which will tend to maintain and strengthen the public’s trust and confidence in the integrity of parliament and never undertake any action which would bring the House of Commons, or its members generally, into disrepute”. Parish has held the safe Conservative seat of Tiverton and Honiton, in Devon, since 2010, winning it with a huge majority of 24,239 in 2019. He is the chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee and is known at Westminster as a champion for animals and farming, quizzing ministers in recent Commons appearances about fertiliser prices and greyhound racing. Thangam Debbonaire, Labour’s shadow Leader of the House of Commons, said: “The Conservatives knew for days about the disgusting behaviour of one of their MPs and tried to cover it up. From the Owen Paterson scandal to their failure to act against their paedophile MP Imran Ahmad Khan, this is a government rotting from the head down. Britain deserves better.” Before Parish’s name emerged, several Conservative MPs, including Nickie Aiken and Simon Hoare, had called on the unnamed MP accused of watching pornography to resign rather than risk others being wrongly named. Anne Jenkin, the peer and co-founder of the Women2Win group trying to get more Tory women into politics, said she thought women would not be put off by incidents of sexual misconduct but it would “makes them angry and angry is good in this space because it’s more likely for women to say, well I’ve got to go into politics to get rid of this stuff”. She added: “It’s a toxic mix of stress, and booze and testosterone and power that makes it so difficult. And I don’t know what the solution is because you can’t do anything about testosterone and you can’t do much about the stress of it, and the power is inevitable. You can do something about the booze. “I mind about values and I think there’s a lot of Conservatives who are extremely embarrassed by what is going on.” Parish gave an interview to GB News this week in which he was asked about allegations of a then-unidentified Tory MP watching pornography in the Commons.

Pressed on whether there was a problem with the culture at Westminster, Parish said: “We’ve got some 650 members of parliament in what is a very intense area. You are going to get people who step over the line.” He added: “It does have to be dealt with and dealt with seriously.” The allegations emerged when female Conservative MPs calling themselves the 2022 group gathered in Westminster to share experiences of misogyny and sexism.",News/Politics,Tory MP Neil Parish faces investigation over claims of watching pornography in Commons,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/29/tory-mp-neil-parish-faces-investigation-over-claims-of-watching-pornography-in-commons
4/30/2022,"At the end of a live GB News interview just three days ago about a report on rural poverty, Neil Parish was asked in passing for his views on claims that a Tory MP had been caught watching pornography. “If you have got 650 members of parliament in what is a very intense area you are going to get people that step over the line,” the Conservative MP told GB News, pokerfaced. “I don’t think there is necessarily a huge culture [of that behaviour] here but it does have to be dealt with and dealt with seriously and I think that is what the whips will do in our whips’ office.” After a 12-year parliamentary career in which the MP for Tiverton and Honiton had rarely – if ever – been elevated to national importance, he now finds himself at the centre of a political storm after it emerged on Friday that the Tory whip had been removed from him over the allegations. A farmer and former member of the European parliament for South West England, and a councillor before that, Parish was part of the 2010 parliamentary intake when he won what has increasingly become a safe Tory seat. Since then, he has avoided controversy and has tended to measure his words relatively carefully in media appearances and has served since 2015 as chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee (Efra). 'You are going to get people that step over the line.'Neil Parish, who has had the whip removed following accusations he watched pornography in the Commons, spoke to Darren McCaffrey earlier this week and denied there was a cultural problem in Parliament. pic.twitter.com/bHHQedHpdo One of the few areas where he has gone against the grain of his own party has been in his opposition to rewilding, which he opposes despite it being a position endorsed by Boris Johnson himself and most of the party. One Tory source with previous experience working with him on the Efra committee – to which Parish was returned as chair in successive terms – described him as quiet and hard working. “He would not have been on the top of my list of suspects,” they said, adding that Parish, 65, is “rather boring, actually”. Parish had been a farmer in his native Somerset and still lives on the family farm, according to a profile on his website, which says he is married and has two children and two grandchildren. The MP employs his wife as a junior secretary, according to his register of interests, which also declares interests from the family farm in Somerset. The MP’s website also lists “the politics of Africa” as being among his other interests, adding that a ban on him re-entering Zimbabwe after he criticised Robert Mugabe’s regime in his capacity as an election monitor remained in place to this day. The MP had said this week that he also wore “as a badge of honour” the fact that he was among more than 280 MPs who had been “sanctioned” by Russia. Records of Parish’s parliamentary voting record, meanwhile, show that he has tended to go – in the vast majority of cases – in the same direction as Tory colleagues, though he was among those who had advocated during the 2016 referendum for the UK to remain in the EU. In the past, Parish had gained some fans among animal welfare campaigners when he tried to stop the government signing post-Brexit trade deals that would have devalued animal welfare. Nevertheless, nature campaigners have reacted to the latest news by saying they hoped that he would be replaced on the committee by someone who was more in favour of nature restoration than Parish, who usually takes the side of landowners and farmers in rewilding debates.",News/Politics,Neil Parish: Tory MP at centre of Commons pornography scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/29/neil-parish-tory-mp-scandal-profile
4/30/2022,"A former police officer who had sex with vulnerable women and pursued inappropriate relationships after meeting them in the course of his duties has been jailed for three years. Oliver Perry-Smith was described as a “sexual predator” who “abused his power” and “broke public trust” by pursuing female members of the public for sex while at Thames Valley police. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) watchdog began an investigation in November 2019 and found that Perry-Smith had a case to answer for gross misconduct. The IOPC said the officer pursued six women between September 2014 and November 2019 whom he had met through his duties. The 38-year-old, who joined Thames Valley police in 2009 and passed its exam to become a sergeant, had sexual contact with three and tried to establish sexual contact with the others, the watchdog said. He looked up the details of one of those women, and a seventh woman, on the force’s computer systems for no policing purpose while based at Newbury police station, the IOPC added. The watchdog ruled that the women had all been in vulnerable positions, either because they were subject to a police complaint requiring investigation or else were victims, witnesses or acting as appropriate adults for young victims of crime. His actions were uncovered in 2019 when a woman called police after Perry-Smith, who had previously attended the home of her friend, then texted her an indecent image. The watchdog found that the officer had also looked up details for her and her family on the police computer system. On another occasion he used a police computer to identify a woman using her car registration after parking next to her and watching her go into a shop, the IOPC said. Perry-Smith, from Newbury, subsequently called at her home without a policing purpose and made personal comments about her appearance, despite knowing she was alone with a young child, the watchdog said. The woman became suspicious and made a complaint to the IOPC. The former PC pleaded guilty to three charges of misconduct in public office, and two charges of unauthorised access to computer material, contrary to the Computer Misuse Act 1990. Perry-Smith, who resigned from Thames Valley police on 8 February this year, was sentenced at Reading crown court to three years and six months in prison. IOPC regional director Graham Beesley said: “Perry-Smith was a sexual predator and his conduct caused significant distress to the women involved. He was prolific in the abuse of his position over a five-year period and his acts were intentional, deliberate, targeted and planned. “His actions were often at the expense of his formal policing duties.” Beesley said Perry-Smith’s actions had “seriously undermined the good work of the large majority of police officers who professionally serve the public on a daily basis”. The IOPC said he would also be placed on the barred list, preventing future employment within the police service. Senior crown prosecutor Charles White, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said Perry-Smith had taken “advantage of his privileged position and access to police resources to pursue several women over a few years”. He said: “He knowingly breached police policy when he made personal visits while on duty. He seemed to think that by lying to his superiors and using his duties as an excuse, he’d be immune to the consequences of his actions. “Today’s sentence proves no one is above the law, including those meant to uphold it. Perry-Smith abused his power, broke public trust, and made many women feel uncomfortable or unsafe in his inappropriate pursuit of them.” Information and support for anyone affected by sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

The 34-year-old has announced he intends to move abroad after his only season at the Rec but could yet extend his playing career in the United States, France or Japan. Cipriani has struggled to make an impact on the pitch for Bath this season, making only eight starts having joined from Gloucester after an extended break from the game. His impact off the field, however, was recently lauded by the Bath director of rugby Stuart Hooper, who tipped the fly-half to make the transition into coaching. “My last couple games in England are fast arriving!!! I’ve decided to move on to experience a new country and make great memories with my family,” Cipriani wrote on Instagram. “Over the years I’ve accrued some amazing loyal supporters. I’m grateful.

4/30/2022,"Todd Boehly’s consortium has been chosen as the preferred bidder in the race to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich, despite Sir Jim Ratcliffe announcing that he had made a late offer worth more than £4bn. Sources around the process said on Friday that Boehly’s group had seen off competition from rival bidders. There has been no official confirmation from any of the parties involved in the sale but a decision is expected to be announced soon. Boehly’s consortium emerged as the likeliest to complete a takeover after Stephen Pagliuca’s consortium and Sir Martin Broughton’s group were informed they were out of the running. Boehly is the part-owner of the LA Dodgers and founder of Eldridge Industries. The American has partnered with his fellow Dodgers owner Mark Walter, the Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss, the British property developer Jonathan Goldstein and the US investment firm Clearlake Capital and they expect to be granted exclusivity. If the sale goes through, the Tory peer Daniel Finkelstein and the publicist Barbara Charone will become non-executive directors. There was confusion when Ratcliffe, the owner of the British petrochemicals company Ineos, revealed on Friday that he had made his move to buy the European champions a fortnight after the deadline for final bids.. Britain’s richest man offered to pay £2.5bn for Chelsea and included a pledge to invest £1.75bn in the club over the next 10 years. A source close to Abramovich did not completely rule out Ratcliffe from the running but it is expected the billionaire communicated his interest too late to Raine, the American bank handling the sale. Chelsea will need to present their preferred bidder to the UK government and apply for a licence to complete the takeover. The purchase will also need to pass the Premier League’s fit and proper persons test. The bidders have been waiting for clarity after final talks with the club at Stamford Bridge this week. They faced a late demand from Abramovich to raise their offers by £500m to meet the Russian oligarch’s £3bn valuation. It was suggested that the extra funds would be donated to charity as part of Abramovich’s promise to give away all net proceeds from the sale. The bidders had already been asked to provide commitments to invest about £1bn in Chelsea’s stadium and squad. Abramovich, who has also vowed to write off £1.5bn in loans he has given to Chelsea since 2003, pledged to donate the net proceeds of the sale to all victims of the war in Ukraine before he was sanctioned by the British government last month. Ministers have insisted he will not be allowed to make anything from the sale. Chelsea have been in limbo since sanctions were imposed on Abramovich. They cannot buy or sell players and cannot hand out new contracts. Thomas Tuchel, the manager of the men’s team, believes the sanctions have influenced Antonio Rüdiger’s decision to join Real Madrid on a free this summer. Indications that the takeover is moving towards a conclusion would be a boost for Tuchel. Ratcliffe’s bid came as a surprise given that the billionaire has previously said there is no value in buying Premier League clubs. That view appears to have changed, though Ratcliffe has looked at buying Chelsea from Abramovich in the past. Ineos, which would have to sell its stake in Nice if the Chelsea bid is successful, said in a statement: “Sir Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of Ineos, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for £4.25bn. £2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with £1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. This is a British bid, for a British club.” Ineos, which has taken over the former Team Sky cycling team and has a stake in the Mercedes Formula One team, said there would be investment in Stamford Bridge, the men’s and women’s first teams and the academy. “We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city,” the statement said. “One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club.”",Sport/Football,Chelsea sale: Boehly group the preferred bidder despite late Ratcliffe bid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/chelsea-sir-jim-ratcliffe-bid-to-buy-club-abramovich
4/30/2022,"Britain is poised to impose a form of direct rule over the British Virgin Islands after the Caribbean territory’s premier was arrested in Miami on suspicion of drug running, and a UK-appointed commission of inquiry found rampant failings in governance. Andrew Fahie appeared in federal court in Miami on Friday, a day after he was arrested by the US Drug Enforcement Agency in an elaborate sting operation that also snared the chief executive of the BVI port authority and her son. Late on Friday night it emerged federal prosecutors had charged him with cocaine trafficking and money laundering conspiracies. Hours before his court appearance, the commission of inquiry – launched in 2021 – reported on widespread abuses, including millions of dollars of government funds that were spent each year by politicians and ministries without proper process. In its highly critical final report, the commission, led by Judge Sir Gary Hickinbottom, recommended that the territory should have its constitution suspended, its elected government dissolved and effectively be ruled from London. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, did not immediately impose direct rule but said the report showed “clearly that substantial legislative and constitutional change is required to restore the standards of governance that the people of the BVI are entitled to”. The UK is already responsible for defence and foreign policy in the BVI, which is a British overseas territory, but Governor General John Rankin – Queen Elizabeth’s representative on the island – is now expected to take charge of all BVI domestic policy and budgets. The report is not directly linked to Fahie’s dramatic arrest, but the British government had been clearly aware of the US Drug Enforcement Agency investigation into drug running. After the DEA sting operation on Thursday, British ministers decided to rush out publication of the Hickinbottom report, short-circuiting a planned consultation procedure with island politicians. The UK last imposed direct rule on an overseas territory when it took charge of the Turks and Caicos Islands in 2009, and the British government is clearly nervous over how its plans will be greeted on the islands. The UK minister for the overseas territories, Amanda Milling, is now to fly to the BVI for discussions with local officials. Allegations of rampant criminality on the BVI had prompted starkly contrasting approaches from US and UK authorities, with the UK adopting a public commission of inquiry dominated by lawyers and the US launching an elaborate undercover police operation that eventually led to the territory’s most senior elected official. The BVI commission of inquiry was launched in 2021 amid allegations of corruption and drug running at the highest level on the islands. Those claims were not investigated by the commission, but its 1,000-page report concluded that maladministration was so endemic that it would be impossible to prevent corruption and conflicts of interest in the awarding of contracts, appointments to public office and the administration of money. The UK has come under increasing pressure to crack down on drug trafficking through the territory, which has become a major conduit for narcotics into the US. Fahie was arrested on a private jet in Miami, where he was being shown what he thought was a $700,000 payment in return for allowing BVI ports to be used as a “resting place” for cocaine from Mexico before it was shipped to Puerto Rico and Miami. US agencies had wiretapped an informant acting as drug runner and in a succession of meetings negotiated a deal that Fahie calculated would bring him more than $7m. At a court hearing conducted via Zoom on Friday, Fahie did not speak other than to state his name and date of birth and agree for the hearing to be conducted online. A bond hearing was set for next Wednesday. In his report, Hickinbottom insisted the suspension of the powers of elected ministers “was not only warranted but essential if the abuses which I have identified are to be tackled and brought to an end”. He said that successive BVI governments had “deliberately sought to avoid good governance by not putting processes in place and where such processes are in place by passing them or ignoring them as and when they wish – which is regrettably often”. Hickinbottom said he had no desire to frustrate the islands’ aspirations to self-determination as a modern democracy and recommended a year-long constitutional review to end opportunities for abuse and dishonesty in public office. He urged the governor general to set up an advisory body of local people with whom he should consult about how to rule the island. Hickinbottom said he had made his recommendations, including the dissolution of the assembly, “with a heavy heart”. “[But] unless the most urgent and drastic steps are taken, the current situation with the elected government deliberately ignoring the tenets of good governance will go on indefinitely,” he said.

4/30/2022,"Even as Conservative whips claimed they were hunting down the MP who made anonymous derogatory comments about Angela Rayner this week, one senior Tory minister was already making light of it. Following the claim that Labour’s deputy leader had been using a “Basic Instinct” ploy to distract Boris Johnson, a male minister was seen making a series of jokes about women crossing and uncrossing their legs suggestively while in one of parliament’s bars. The remarks, witnessed by someone working in Westminster, are the latest sign of a macho culture that it is struggling to shake off. Five years on from another scandal at the heart of government, which resulted in the sacking of the effective deputy prime minister, Damian Green, the slur against Rayner led to female politicians raising the alarm over ongoing alleged misogyny and sexual misconduct, including a Conservative MP allegedly caught watching pornography on his phone in the Commons. Female politicians say sexist and demeaning treatment on the parliamentary estate continues unchecked. “Everybody has experience of sexism, it’s just rife,” said Alex Davies-Jones, Labour MP and shadow minister. “You know, comments about appearance, and comments on what we’re wearing rather than what we’re saying.” Three cabinet ministers are said to be among more than 50 MPs facing complaints of sexual misconduct made to the parliamentary watchdog. Many of the most blatant examples relate to after-hours drinking in Westminster’s bars. Lynne Featherstone, who served as equalities minister in the coalition government and now sits in the Lords, recalled an incident on the Commons terrace when she was still an MP. A Labour MP in his sixties “kept saying to his researchers, ‘come and sit on my knee’ and different ones were taking a turn sitting on his knee and giggling and stuff”, she said. “It was just horrible to watch. He was pulling them onto his knee and they were giggling because they were young and impressionable.” The Labour MP Jess Phillips recalled seeing similar behaviour from Conservative MPs. “I’ve watched older Tory men having young women sitting on their laps on the terrace on a late night,” she said. In the chamber itself, sexism comes most often in the form of patronising or derogatory comments. It is more than a decade since David Cameron told Labour’s Angela Eagle to “calm down dear” during a Commons exchange, but women in parliament say belittling treatment is still routine. Phillips, who describes herself as “quite rowdy in the chamber”, says she is frequently shushed by Tories on the opposite benches. “You get men, and it is always men, on the opposite benches who treat you like a harridan for behaving just exactly as they behave. I’ve had people putting their fingers to their lips and doing the calm down sign with their hands. “They wouldn’t necessarily perceive that they were being sexist, but they wouldn’t do it to a man. They wouldn’t shush like you’re a child in a classroom.” Anna Soubry, a former minister and Conservative MP until she moved to Change UK in 2019, said one Tory colleague used to tease her from the benches during every prime minister’s questions. “In parliament, it gets very hot and stuffy, and I’d sit there and fan myself with the order paper and I’d get this: ‘Ooh, are you having a hot flush dear?’ It really pissed me off because I wasn’t but I didn’t know what to say.” When she pulled the colleague up on it, she said he got defensive and said it was “just a joke”. Soubry believes he was doing it “to try to humiliate”. She added: “Obviously I never complained about it because there was no point.” Soubry also said a fellow Tory MP once made an “incredibly shocking” and “excruciatingly embarrassing” comment about her body that she reported to the whips at the time, who spoke to the man about it. Phillips believes the worst behaviour comes back to a culture of politicians, particularly men, protecting each other. “I think there are some people who do not know how to behave and are covered by power and friendship to behave that way,” she said. “That’s the problem. The culture in Westminster is not an overtly sexist one. The culture in Westminster is one where people protect their own, but their own being men. Men are much more likely to be protected by other men than women are to be protected.” Female clerks, researchers and others working on the parliamentary estate without the status of being an MP can face worse problems. Phillips said: “A lot of clerks in the past have told me that they’ve been treated very sexistly and treated like little girls and like they’re stupid.” Louisa Casson, 30, worked as a political adviser in an MP’s office in her mid 20s before moving to charity work. She said that “laddish banter” was commonplace, with MPs commenting on colleagues’ wives and giggling at puerile jokes. “You’d get quite macho banter in policy meetings which I’d find extraordinary or just quite uncomfortable,” she said. “There was a conversation about blue tits at one point, in the context of the bird, and a couple of MPs were sniggering and making jokes about that.” For women in a tiny minority when they first became MPs, the latest uproar and debate offer hope, despite the behaviour they’ve exposed. Harriet Harman, who by October will have spent 40 years sitting on parliament’s green benches, said: “There’s always been a male impunity for misogyny in the House of Commons. And when there was just a handful of us women MPs, and we were very marginalised, it felt impossible to do anything about it. “It was my everyday experience having a climate of misogyny from MPs that was amplified by a collusive press. But for me and the other women at the time, we just didn’t feel there was anything we could do about it. We just had to grin and bear it and try to get on with our work.” Harman believes the latest backlash against sexism in Westminster could mark its death knell. “It’s not all men [who] are doing it,” she said. “But all women have experienced it in the House of Commons. And they’re just calling time on it. “Now, because there are many more woman MPs, and because they are much more confident and assertive, and because there are woman MPs on all sides, they are not prepared to put up with it anymore. And therefore, the age of male misogyny in the House of Commons is going to end … there’s going to be no hiding place.”",News/Politics,‘It’s rife’: female MPs tell of climate of misogyny in Westminster,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/29/its-just-rife-female-mps-tell-of-climate-of-misogyny-in-westminster
4/30/2022,"“Unless we ensure individuals are brought to justice, nothing will change,” Kate Maltby wrote in the Guardian in 2019. The latest comments about male colleagues’ “wandering hands” from the international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, combined with the fact that no fewer than 56 MPs are under investigation over sexual conduct, suggest that not only have things not changed for the better since Ms Maltby raised her own complaint in 2017, in some respects they may even have got worse. True, some MPs have been held to account for inappropriate behaviour. Damian Green was sacked from his position as first secretary of state in 2017 after an investigation found that he had lied to parliament about pornography on his computer. No definitive conclusion was reached in relation to Ms Maltby’s claim that he had behaved wrongly towards her, although her account was found to be “plausible”. In 2020 the former Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke was sentenced to two years in jail for three sexual assaults – two of them on a parliamentary worker. Another Conservative MP, Imran Ahmad Khan, was this month found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy in 2008, while the Tory MP David Warburton has had the whip removed after allegations emerged of sexual harassment and cocaine use. Labour MP Liam Byrne also faces suspension from the Commons for non-sexual bullying of a male staffer. But others continue to escape punishment, as the Liberal Democrat Lord Lester did when he resigned from the House of Lords in 2018 after peers voted not to sanction him for sexual harassment. Tory MP Crispin Blunt resigned from his position as chair of an all-party LGBT+ rights group this month, after being criticised for publicly attacking Ahmad Khan’s conviction. But the whip was not withdrawn. And Boris Johnson’s whips seemed reluctant, initially, to act against another MP, Neil Parish, who is alleged to have been seen watching pornography at work by two colleagues. Instead, it was suggested that it was for these witnesses to report him to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme set up following #MeToo. On Friday, it was announced that Mr Parish would report himself, and the whip was suspended. That these reports, which include Ms Trevelyan saying she was once “pinned up against a wall” by a male MP, should come just a week after a highly public attempt to humiliate Labour’s Angela Rayner for crossing her legs, makes them all the more dismaying. And there is a sense of rising anger among female MPs, both about the specific behaviour on display in parliament and the culture of impunity that continues to surround MPs; and about wider trends, including the increasing use of pornography in public places, and smartphone-enabled harassment. Still, optimists point to the fact that women are now more likely these days to complain about male behaviour that would previously have been tolerated. And given everything we know about the number of sexual harassment and abuse experiences that go unreported, it is difficult to assert with confidence that sexual misconduct in parliament has become more common, or less, based on anecdotal evidence. What can be stated firmly is that it is damaging both to politics and to society when senior public figures such as MPs treat women with such contempt. Labour has its own difficulties in this area. This month a group of senior women in the party called for an end to the use of confidentiality agreements when allegations are made. But the latest news about Mr Parish, following Ahmad Khan’s conviction, Mr Warburton’s suspension and the scurrilous attack on Ms Rayner, mean that Boris Johnson’s party heads into next week’s local elections in a cloud of sleaze.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on sexism in Westminster: this sleaze harms us all | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/29/the-guardian-view-on-sexism-in-westminster-this-sleaze-harms-us-all
4/30/2022,"As the war in Ukraine and its consequences weaken Russia’s conventional military, Vladimir Putin’s government has resorted to nuclear threats designed to project strength. Mr Putin wants to intimidate his opponents. But his strategy is failing. Instead of Ukraine’s allies backing down, they are stepping up their support. The US Congress this week approved $11bn of arms to Ukraine, three times the total military aid Washington has so far given. The US president, Joe Biden, was right to call out Mr Putin for making “idle comments” about nuclear weapons. It is unthinkable that blunders and miscalculations would take the world to the edge of the nuclear abyss. Yet that is where the world is heading. Whereas the Cuban missile crisis lasted 13 days, Russia’s war is already into its third month. With no clear end in sight, more deadly battles look inevitable – increasing the chances of mistakes. Mr Putin could be using nuclear rhetoric to give the appearance of being unstable. His war is illegal and immoral. His justification for starting the invasion was macabre and ludicrous. However, this may be an act. Russia’s president could be trying to back coercive diplomacy with the “madman theory” of threatening excessive force, which includes the spectre of nuclear weapons. However disagreeable this might seem, a rational Mr Putin, with 2,000 tactical nuclear warheads, is preferable to an irrational one. The concentration of such power in one man’s hands ought to make the world sit up. Russia has few mechanisms to prevent Mr Putin resorting to nuclear weapons if he decided he had nothing to lose. In the Guardian last month, Christopher S Chivvis at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace wrote that in war game scenarios he had taken part in, which considered what would happen if Russia hit Ukraine with nuclear weapons, the only way of de-escalation was when “clear political off-ramps and lines of communication between Moscow and Washington have remained open. In all the other games, the world is basically destroyed.” That is why the US president has been careful not to provide Russia with a reason to go nuclear. Mr Biden made it clear that the US would not place boots on the ground, establish a no-fly zone or conduct intercontinental ballistic missile tests. What Mr Biden has shown is that conventional anti-tank and anti-aircraft technologies have reached a new level of capability, one which has rendered conventional invading ground forces – unless overwhelmingly massed – almost obsolete. Mr Biden has been shrewder than more gung-ho Democrats or their ideological soulmates found in Boris Johnson’s government. Faced with costly military setbacks, Mr Putin has refocused Russia on tightening its hold in Ukraine’s east and south. The fighting might get worse before it gets better. Pursuing Kyiv’s objectives through relatively limited means has worked, though Russia has been able to target civilians indiscriminately. Ukrainians have every right to define their war aims. So do their Nato allies. One of their goals is not to increase the chances that the war becomes a potentially nuclear conflict. Western leaders should therefore reject provocative and escalatory requests out of hand. Nothing else could be more dangerous.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Putin’s nuclear threats: Russia is losing in Ukraine | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/29/the-guardian-view-on-putins-nuclear-threats-russia-is-losing-in-ukraine
4/30/2022,"With awkward embraces and fixed grins, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Mohammed bin Salman struck a pose of reconciliation. For the past three years, the presence of the Turkish leader and the Saudi crown prince in the same room would have been unthinkable, but in a drawing room of a Jeddah palace on Friday, both tried to signal a new beginning. There was no sign of the acrimony that had set the regional rivals apart and – most definitely – no mention of the reason for the rift: the Saudi murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Instead, Erdoğan, who had been prepared to take bilateral relations between regional heavyweights beyond the brink, seemed content to be standing in his rival’s palace. The Saudi crown prince, meanwhile, had the look of a man who had won a prize. The path to this point had been fraught. Ties between Saudi Arabia and Turkey had been mostly severed since October 2018, when a team of assassins, most of them security aides to Prince Mohammed, flew to Istanbul to ambush and dismember the Saudi dissident inside the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul. But the murder was taped by Turkish spies and the ensuing investigation led to the heart of Prince Mohammed’s court, resulting in Erdoğan boycotting the defacto leader and rebuffing billions of dollars in compensation offered by Saudi envoys. It also amplified a faultline at the time between an alliance of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt, on one hand, and an opposing bloc of Qatar, Turkey and the remnants of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood on the other. For more than three years, the two sides dug in, and Erdoğan rarely missed a moment to embarrass the Saudi heir, or to assert Ankara as a regional counterweight to Riyadh. But, battered by a troubled economy at home, facing an election, and seemingly tiring of isolation, Erdoğan’s hardline stance has gradually given way to realpolitik. He has reached out to the UAE and Israel and has even made overtures to Egypt, where ties have remained poisonous since the coup that ousted the regime of Mohamed Morsi and ushered in the strongman Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Saudi Arabia, however, was the trickiest bridge to cross. For Erdoğan to win a reset, he needed to eat humble pie. Last year a view started to take shape in Turkey that it had reaped little advantage from its standoff with Riyadh. With Donald Trump still in the White House, there may have been more of an angle for leverage. But the 2020 US election changed that; Joe Biden has distanced himself from both leaders, and neither are particularly fond of him. If there was to be detente, however, one problem needed to be fixed; the ongoing in trial in absentia in Istanbul of Khashoggi’s accused killers. Earlier this month, Prince Mohammed got his wish when a Turkish prosecutor decided to stop the trial. The stage was set. So, with eyes on trade ties, and using a pilgrimage to Mecca as cover, Erdoğan stood in front of Prince Mohammed on Friday, his ambitions to consolidate a rival power base to Riyadh subsumed by domestic politics and a desperate need for economic growth that trade ties with Saudi Arabia would help Erdoğan also paid homage to the Saudi monarch, King Salman, with whom he had tried to deal directly in the weeks after Khashoggi’s death in an effort to sideline Prince Mohammed. At home, his visit was observed in sombre tones, with any mention of Khashoggi kept to a minimum. “My visit is the manifestation of our common will to start a new era of cooperation as two brotherly countries,” Erdoğan said before leaving Istanbul. He was met in Jeddah as if nothing had ever split the two countries. Privately, however, Saudi officials were jubilant. Erdoğan’s trip had capped Turkey’s ambitions to play more of a regional role, one official told the Guardian. “He needs us more than we need him, and he’s the one traveling to us. This stance of his has cost him billions in lost revenues. Any trade will be on our terms.”",News/World news,Khashoggi row goes unmentioned as Erdoğan seeks to boost Saudi trade ties,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/khashoggi-row-goes-unmentioned-as-erdogan-seeks-to-boost-saudi-trade-ties
4/30/2022,"Big retailers have been accused of putting financial pressure on staff to come into work with Covid-19 after they cut the right to extra sick leave for workers affected by the virus. Sainsbury’s and Tesco are taking away the right to additional sick pay for those with Covid from this weekend, while Next said it had reverted to its standard sick pay policy a few weeks ago. Previously, the businesses offered additional sick leave to workers with coronavirus, to cover those who needed to isolate, as required under government rules. The retailers said they were changing their sick pay rules in line with the government’s new “living with Covid” policy for England that came in on 24 February, under which those who test positive for Covid are no longer legally required to self-isolate. In contrast, Asda said it offers up to 10 days’ extra sick pay for those with coronavirus. Bev Clarkson, the national officer for the union Unite, said: “By scrapping their Covid absence policies, Sainsbury’s and Tesco are encouraging infected staff who are worried about being off to go into work, putting other workers and customers at risk.” Daniel Adams, the national officer for the shopworkers’ union Usdaw, said it was “incredibly disappointed” that Tesco had made the changes. “Inevitably, with these changes, there is a risk that employees may have to make a decision based on affordability rather than their health or wellbeing. The fact that the government has withdrawn even the minimal support of statutory sick pay from day one further exacerbates the problem,” he said. Sainsbury’s and Tesco both said they were asking or encouraging staff to stay at home if they were sick. Nevertheless, the unions said some workers might feel compelled to come into work regardless, if they could not be sure of claiming sick pay. Next said it was following government guidance in leaving the decision up to individuals on whether to come into work after testing positive with Covid, but said it was not aware of any member of staff wanting to do so. A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We have reviewed our policies in line with the latest government guidance for England, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland. As part of this, we are approaching colleague sick leave relating to Covid-19 just as we would with another illness like flu. “We’re continuing to ask colleagues who test positive or develop Covid-19 symptoms to stay at home and be considerate of others, and any colleagues who need to stay at home and are unable to carry out their roles can continue to receive pay.” The retailer said it was unlikely that anyone with Covid would use up their company sick pay allowance for the year, which amounts to 3% of their annual contracted hours or an average of 10 days, according to the Unite union. The spokesperson said that any decision on further company sick pay beyond a worker’s usual allowance would now be “at their manager’s discretion”. Next, which in January was one of the first major retailers to cut sick pay for its unvaccinated staff who have to isolate after coming into contact with someone who has Covid, said absence with the illness was now “treated in exactly the same way as any other illness absence, with the same sickness payment structure”. Government guidelines currently ask, but don’t legally require those testing positive with Covid to “try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people” for five days after first testing positive. It advises those who do leave home within that period to wear a surgical face mask or other well-fitting face covering, avoid crowded places such as public transport, and to take other precautions such as covering their mouth and nose when they cough or sneeze and washing their hands frequently with soap and water or using hand sanitiser.",News/Business,Sainsbury’s and Tesco criticised for cutting extra Covid sick leave,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/29/sainsburys-tesco-criticised-covid-sick-leave-pay
