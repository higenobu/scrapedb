3/8/2022,"By Catherine Belton LONDON (Reuters) -Russia has told Ukraine it is ready to halt military operations ""in a moment"" if Kyiv meets a list of conditions, the Kremlin spokesman said on Monday. Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was demanding that Ukraine cease military action, change its constitution to enshrine neutrality, acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory, and recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent states. It was the most explicit Russian statement so far of the terms it wants to impose on Ukraine to halt what it calls its ""special military operation"", now in its 12th day. Peskov told Reuters in a telephone interview that Ukraine was aware of the conditions. ""And they were told that all this can be stopped in a moment."" There was no immediate reaction from the Ukrainian side. Russia has attacked Ukraine from the north, east and south, pounding cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv and the port of Mariupol. The invasion launched on Feb. 24, has caused the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two, provoked outrage across the world, and led to heavy sanctions on Moscow. But the Kremlin spokesman insisted Russia was not seeking to make any further territorial claims on Ukraine and said it was ""not true"" that it was demanding Kyiv be handed over. ""We really are finishing the demilitarisation of Ukraine. We will finish it. But the main thing is that Ukraine ceases its military action. They should stop their military action and then no one will shoot,"" he said. On the issue of neutrality, Peskov said: ""They should make amendments to the constitution according to which Ukraine would reject any aims to enter any bloc."" He added: ""We have also spoken about how they should recognise that Crimea is Russian territory and that they need to recognise that Donetsk and Lugansk are independent states. And that’s it. It will stop in a moment."" NEW TALKS The outlining of Russia's demands came as delegations from Russia and Ukraine prepared to meet on Monday for a third round of talks aimed at ending Russia’s war against Ukraine. It began soon after Putin recognised two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014, as independent - an action denounced as illegal by the West. ""This is not us seizing Lugansk and Donetsk from Ukraine. Donetsk and Lugansk don’t want to be part of Ukraine. But it doesn’t mean they should be destroyed as a result,"" Peskov said. ""For the rest. Ukraine is an independent state that will live as it wants, but under conditions of neutrality."" He said all the demands have been formulated and handed over during the first two rounds of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, which took place last week. ""We hope that all this will go OK and they will react in a suitable way,"" Peskov said. Russia had been forced into taking decisive actions to force the demilitarisation of Ukraine, he said, rather than just recognising the independence of the breakaway regions. This was in order to protect the 3 million Russian-speaking population in these republics, who he said were being threatened by 100,000 Ukrainian troops. ""We couldn’t just recognise them. What were we going to do with the 100,000 army that was standing at the border of Donetsk and Lugansk that could attack at any moment. They were being brought U.S. and British weapons all the time,"" he said. In the run-up to the Russian invasion, Ukraine repeatedly and emphatically denied Moscow's assertions that it was about to mount an offensive to take back the separatist regions by force. Peskov said the situation in Ukraine had posed a much greater threat to Russia’s security than it had in 2014, when Russia had also amassed 150,000 troops at its border with Ukraine, prompting fears of a Russian invasion, but had limited its action to the annexation of Crimea. ""Since then the situation has worsened for us. In 2014, they began supplying weapons to Ukraine and preparing the army for NATO, bringing it in line with NATO standards,"" he said. ""In the end what tipped the balance was the lives of these 3 million people in Donbass. We understood they would be attacked."" Peskov said Russia had also had to act in the face of the threat it perceived from NATO, saying it was ""only a matter of time"" before the alliance placed missiles in Ukraine as it had in Poland and Romania. ""We just understood we could not put up with this any more. We had to act,"" he said.

3/8/2022,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) attempted to blame Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Joe Biden Monday, only to be brutally humiliated by an acknowledged expert on the situation: Retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. It started when the controversial lawmaker posted a tweet on Sunday claiming “Biden’s poor decision making leading up to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin declaring war on Ukraine.” But Vindman, who as a former national security aide offered key testimony in President Donald Trump’s 2019 impeachment for dealings with Ukraine, refused to let Greene’s statement go by without a fact check. “Nope. It’s because you and your pro-Putin party encouraged Putin to invade, by cheerleading him,” Vindman responded. Vindman’s wife, Rachel Vindman, also chimed in, calling Greene “crazy stupid” and asking, “why do you insist on telling us over and over?” Greene attacked Vindman, saying he wants to “drag Americans into war with Russia with his big tough tweets and his zoom interviews on CNN,” but didn’t deny the substance of his arguments. Nor did she deny or object to him accusing her and the GOP of being “pro-Putin.” This clown wants to drag Americans into war with Russia with his big tough tweets and his zoom interviews on CNN.Go ahead and go fight yourself since you’re from Ukraine.You are clueless about Americans being fed up with sending our sons and daughters to die in foreign lands. https://t.co/hBB2vHUjtN — Rep.

3/8/2022,"A father and daughter visiting Yellowstone National Park for the first time on Saturday enjoyed an exceedingly rare encounter with a wolverine in what their guide described as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. “For the rest of the tour, the 9-year-old daughter couldn’t stop saying, every 15 minutes or so, ‘Wow… we saw a wolverine today!’” MacNeil Lyons, owner of Yellowstone Insight, recalled to For The Win Outdoors. “She told me it was the most amazing day ever in her life.” Lyons captured several images of the elusive critter, which he shared via Facebook. In a Saturday post that included a photo showing the wolverine facing the group from the road, Lyons commented on the rarity of the encounter and added: “It was only 2-3 minutes, but it was as if time stood still. There was for sure a true and focused connection between two sentient beings.” On Sunday, Lyons detailed how he captured the images and said he and his Southern California clients “felt beyond elated at this chance encounter,” considering that the number of wolverines residing inside park boundaries might be a few as seven. (See Facebook post below.) Lyons did not disclose the location of the sighting, but explained that it occurred at 11:38 a.m. as he was rounding a corner. The wolverine, in the oncoming lane, was visible as a “low to-the-ground, dark animal loping away from us.” RELATED: Rare footage shows elusive Yellowstone National Park cougar One of his guests asked if it was a small bear, but Lyons quickly realized that what they were observing “was, indeed, a wolverine!” Perhaps the last time a documented wolverine sighting in Yellowstone National Park generated headlines was January 2021. The park shared video footage captured a month earlier by a motion-sensor trail camera and stated: “Last month, park biologists were excited to find one of Yellowstone’s rarest mammals triggered a remote trail camera outside the Mammoth Hot Springs area!” It was the first video footage of a wolverine captured by a trail camera inside the park. Wolverines, members of the weasel family, reside mostly in high-altitude alpine and forest habitat and can weigh as much as 30 pounds. They prey largely on small mammals and birds, and also eat vegetation. But wolverines can be ferocious and are capable of killing animals many times their size. Wolverines are mostly solitary except during breeding season. They’re active during the day and den in deep snow or beneath fallen or uprooted trees.",U.S./FTW Outdoors,Yellowstone tourists encounter one of park’s rarest animals,https://news.yahoo.com/yellowstone-tourists-encounter-one-park-170119584.html

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below."" Blood type doesn’t affect much in our daily lives. In fact, most people don’t even know whether they’re Type A, B, AB, or O. But the seemingly-banal detail might be a factor in who comes under the thumb of 2020’s world-wide tyrant—that is, coronavirus. A new study in the journal PLOS Genetics revealed that people with Type A blood are more likely to have a severe case of Covid-19. A previous study in the journal Blood Advances from 2020 also affirmed this research, adding that people with Type O blood seem to be more protected from Covid-19. Researchers in China first shared this idea back in March 2020, and the findings were echoed by a paper out of Columbia University a month later. Even DNA testing company 23andMe tapped their customers and found that among 750,000 people (by far the biggest study population yet) who were diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19, those with type O were more protected. Then, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed the idea with a peer-reviewed study: Folks with Type A blood were 45 percent more likely to become infected with COVID-19 than those with other blood types, while those with Type O were 35 percent less likely. ""It's pretty clear that Type O is protective to some degree. I don't think that having Type A or Type B is the problem—it's just that they don't have Type O,"" says Mark Udden, MD, professor of hematology and oncology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. So people with Type A may be more likely to catch the virus, but whether they also get it worse is still unclear: the NEJM study reports that people with Type A blood were also more likely to have respiratory failure. However, the research out of Columbia University found there wasn’t really any difference among intubations or death and different blood types. And a 2020 study in the Annals of Hematology looked specifically at the link between blood types and the need for intubation or death in confirmed COVID-19 patients. They found no link between blood type and the severity of the illness. The new research in Blood Advances, mentioned above, had similar findings. Although true to the unending questions around the disease, another, smaller study, also in Blood Advances, suggested that blood types A or AB had higher risk of certain intense interventions and longer ICU stays, but the researchers themselves considered the link to be so far “unresolved.” We don’t know why people with Type O might possibly be more protected—but there are a lot of theories. The most basic idea is that blood type might influence a person’s ability to fight the virus, says David Aronoff, M.D., director of the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. It may affect your immune system’s strength or your inflammatory response to the infection. Either way, that would color how likely you are to not only get the virus but also how strong your symptoms are, he explains. The NEJM paper, however, highlights the antibodies we produce depending on blood type. “If you’re type O, you naturally make antibodies against Type A and Type B,” Dr. Udden says. These Type A antibodies might make it more difficult for SARS-CoV-2 to attach to its receptor in Type O blood and multiply in the body, he explains. But there’s another interesting layer to a potential protective element in Type O blood: something called von Willebrand factor, which is a glycoprotein in charge of repairing damage to blood vessels by prompting your blood to clot. We know the COVID-19 virus damages the lining of your blood vessels. Your body then releases von Willebrand factor, or VWF, into your blood so it can fix the damage to the vessel walls. But VWF also encourages clotting. “In COVID-19 patients who die, we're seeing unusually high clotting issues, like strokes, kidney failure, and pulmonary embolisms—so we know there is a clotting problem that stems from the virus,” Dr. Udden says. A 2020 analysis in The Lancet found that compared to COVID-19 patients who weren’t in intensive care, those who were critically ill in the ICU and died had higher VWF antigens in their blood. And guess what: People with Type A blood have higher levels of VWF naturally than people with type O blood, Dr. Udden points out. In addition, people who are Black, who are dying at a disproportionately high rate from COVID-19, tend to have higher levels of VWF, too. Just because you’re Type O doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. All studies so far have only looked at blood type in connection to symptomatic cases of coronavirus, Dr. Aronoff points out. We don’t know about asymptomatic carriers—that is, Type O could still pass along the virus to other people unknowingly just as much as Type A could. ""There are two possibilities: You're Type O so you might not contract the virus because it has no landing strip—there's nothing to attach to,"" Dr. Udden explains. ""Or by being Type O, the virus gets in but the A antibody prevents it from docking with enough cells to cause disease. But the virus is still in your system and you can still pass it to someone else."" No. Blood type is actually a pretty weak player, Dr. Udden says. Socio-economic status is a big vulnerability—likely to need to work outside the home, in crowded buildings, and living in tighter quarters with more family members. Age and health are next in line for susceptibility. If you’re older or have an underlying disease like cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, you’re more likely to develop a severe case of coronavirus, Dr. Udden adds. Blood type is after all of these. People with Type O blood might be slightly more protected from the virus, and people with Type A slightly more vulnerable. But, as far as we know, everyone is still at risk of getting the virus, and definitely at risk of being an asymptomatic carrier—and therefore of spreading it to others. The discovery of Type O’s protective effect is crucial to building an understanding of how the virus works—especially considering there aren’t many other patterns it follows, Dr. Udden points out. But both docs agree it shouldn’t actually change anyone’s behavior. “I’m Type O, and I’m not going to go hang out in bars just because of this slight protective effect,” Dr. Udden says. “These findings shouldn’t change your behavior. Anyone can still get ill with SARS-CoV-2 and/or participate in the chain of transmission,” Dr. Aronoff adds. The bottom line is clear: The safest and most effective way to prevent from getting coronavirus or unknowingly spreading it to others is to keep wearing a mask, getting vaccinated, and socially distancing from people—regardless of your blood type.

3/8/2022,"Russia’s military operation in Ukraine will be “unsustainable” within three weeks, a defence expert has said. Ed Arnold, a research fellow for European security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, said Russia is meeting more resistance from Ukrainian troops than it expected. He told the Reuters news agency on Monday: “At the current rate of Russian losses, which are not confirmed, but we do have indications that this operation would be unsustainable within about three weeks from the Russian perspective.” He added: “In which case that they would have to consolidate the gains already made and look to see a way of trying to freeze the conflict on the current lines of advance while they mobilise more forces from Russia.” While Arnold said Russia continues its advance into Ukraine, he described its progress as “slow”. He said: “Within the north, they are still looking to fully encircle Kyiv. “In the south, the Russian advance is continued to be slow but they're seeing a lot more successes in the south, taking Kherson and consolidating and pushing further west, and then also focusing now on Mariupol. “However, at the moment, the Russian operation is going so badly, especially from logistics point of view that really Russia might just not have the numbers to make another conflict that is cold be hot again."" His comments came as Ukraine claimed on Monday it had retaken the city of Chuhuiv from Russian troops. Lieutenant General Serhiy Shaptala said defending Ukrainian forces had seized Chuhuiv from Russian control, killing two high-ranking Russian commanders in the process. Ukraine’s military, the General Staff, said on Facebook: ""In the course of hostilities, the city of Chuhuiv was liberated.

The discussions will take place in Belarus, close to the border with Poland. In the previous set of talks last Thursday, it was agreed to set up humanitarian corridors to allow refugees to flee Ukraine. But proposed ceasefire attempts in the city of Mariupol collapsed at the weekend. Russia announced new humanitarian corridors on Monday, but Ukraine branded the plans “immoral” as they would lead refugees straight into the arms of Russia and its close ally, Belarus. Meanwhile, the mayor of the Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv claimed that Russians dropped cluster bombs on residential buildings and a zoo on Monday morning. Russia issued a list of demands on Monday, saying Ukraine must follow four criteria for its invasion to stop.
