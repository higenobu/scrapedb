1/17/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors searching for clues as to where Bitcoin is headed next may want to take a look at what the options market is signaling. Most Read from Bloomberg Djokovic Loses Shot at Tennis History as Australia Deports Star One of the World’s Wealthiest Oil Exporters Is Becoming Unlivable Putin’s Troops Wouldn’t Get Cheers in This Once Pro-Russia City DirecTV to Drop One America News in Blow to Conservative Channel The Virus Has Changed. Maybe We Should, Too. The world’s largest cryptocurrency rebounded this week after falling below $40,000 for the first time since September on Monday. The drop put holders on edge. For one, it marked a downturn of roughly 40% from the coin’s record high in November. It also served as a test of what is seen by several technical analysts as a key support level: $40,000. Now Bitcoin appears to have stabilized, and options activity suggests investors believe the test of $40,000 is over, and more upside is ahead, according to a team from Genesis Global Trading including Noelle Acheson. The skew, or difference in implied volatility of bullish and bearish bets, has recently dropped from double-digits to near zero, and revealed a decrease in investor demand for put options and an increase for call options, Genesis data show. “That shift in preference may be bullish for the price of BTC, all else equal,” Acheson added. A bottom at $40,000 is a view echoed by many analysts in the famously optimistic world of crypto. Martin Gaspar and Katherine Webb at CrossTower said in a Friday note that Bitcoin’s reserve risk, a measure of confidence of long-term BTC holders, is currently lower than it was at the coin’s last bottom in July 2021, and now stands in the “buy” zone, which could give “more weight to the indication that this is a bottom.” To be sure, Bitcoin remains as volatile as ever and trading could be choppy in an environment where the Federal Reserve is becoming more hawkish, according to Marko Papic, chief strategist at Clocktower Group. Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 remains at one of its highest readings in the past 12 months. In this environment, “you don’t really want to own high-beta risk assets,” he said. “You want to own things that are much more sensitive to value, much more sensitive to global growth and cyclicals, and that’s why I don’t think crypto and Bitcoin are going to really do great over the next three to six months.” The $40,000 level “has been the key pivot point,” said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Mike McGlone. Up next, $50,000 comes into play before Bitcoin resumes its upward trend toward his forecast of $100,000, he said. “Demand and adoption are increasing and supply is declining,” McGlone said. “Something has to reverse the increasing Bitcoin adoption trend or the rules of economics point to higher prices. I expect demand and adoption trajectories to remain favorable.” McGlone isn’t alone in his calls for Bitcoin to more than double from current levels. Jonathan Padilla, co-founder of Snickerdoodle Labs, a blockchain company focused on data privacy, expects Bitcoin to hit that level by the end of 2022, and also said that $40,000 is likely a floor, given the level of institutional capital he expects to flow into the market this year. “The institutional nature is dramatically different from the primarily retail focus in 2017, 2018,” Padilla said. “That shows the strength of institutional buying and the demand from the long-term perspective.” David Tawil, president of ProChain Capital, was ready to watch the $38,000 level in this past week’s sell-off. But, he hoped to see U.S. tech stocks start to rebound, which signals to him that “the bottom is in” for Bitcoin, he told Bloomberg’s “QuickTake Stock” broadcast. “This is a pretty good buying level, especially if we go ahead and just retrace the losses -- you’re talking about a 50%-plus gain from a year,” Tawil said.

1/17/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- New York state tax revenue soared to $84.4 billion in the first nine months of the fiscal year, $12.9 billion more than forecast, bolstered by a business tax established in April as a work-around for federal limits placed on state and local tax deductions, state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said.

Maybe We Should, Too. New York collected $10.2 billion from a “pass-through entity” tax, DiNapoli said in a news release Friday evening. He cautioned that taxpayers paying the pass-through tax are expected to reduce their personal income tax payments by similar amounts, and the December results may not reflect those offsetting reductions, “clouding our revenue picture.” He urged Governor Kathy Hochul, who will introduce her first budget Tuesday, and the state Legislature to act prudently. “Tax collections performed well in December, and the state’s economy and finances continue their recovery,” DiNapoli said in the release. “But there is continuing uncertainty about the impact of the ongoing Covid-19 surge, economic risks, and the need for continuing financial support for those still struggling to find their footing.” As part of former President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the federal government limited the deductions for individuals, known as SALT, to $10,000. To get around the limits, higher tax states like Connecticut, New Jersey and New York enacted pass-through entity taxes, allowing certain taxpayers to make state business tax payments that are deductible from federal taxes, rather than making state income tax payments that aren’t deductible. New York’s personal income tax receipts for the first three quarters totaled $49 billion and continue to exceed the most recent projections by $1.9 billion, DiNapoli said. Income tax revenue has been boosted by a strong stock market and higher taxes on millionaires. Wall Street profits for the first half of 2021 surged to $31 billion before taxes from a year earlier, a gain of 13% helped by low interest rates and strong trading, underwriting and advisory activities. New York ended the third quarter with a $30.7 billion surplus, $15.2 billion higher than the latest projections and $14.1 billion higher than last year at the same time.
