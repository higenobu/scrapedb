2/9/2022,"There is nothing new about prejudice against the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller community: it dates back centuries. The fury and hurt caused by a “joke” made by the comedian Jimmy Carr, who described the murder of hundreds of thousands of Romany and Sinti Gypsies by the Nazis as a “positive” in a Netflix special in December, is a blunt reminder of its persistence. Ministers are among those to have voiced strong disapproval. Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, pointed out that Ofcom, the UK regulator, would soon gain increased powers over streaming services. But Carr’s routine, and the laughter that was the initial reaction to the offensive section, provide clear evidence that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) people – of whom the last census recorded that there are 58,000 in England and Wales – are still widely regarded as a legitimate target for attitudes that would be seen as unacceptable if aimed at other minorities. One recent study found that 44.6% of those surveyed viewed GRT people negatively – more than any other minority ethnic group.  In education, employment and health, GRT people suffer some of the worst outcomes of any group in the UK. The community’s young people have the highest rates of absence from school and are the least likely to go to university. They are also overrepresented in the criminal justice system. But it is the issue of housing and land that lies at the heart of many difficulties. “Everyone seems to know where we shouldn’t be, but no one knows where we should be,” said Joe Jones, chair of the Gypsy Council, a few months ago. He was talking on the 10th anniversary of the eviction of 80 families from the Dale Farm unauthorised Traveller site in Essex. The pitched battle between police and activists was an experience that some former residents say they have yet to recover from. Since the obligation to provide sufficient sites for the various GRT communities was removed from local authorities in the 1990s, such local disputes have served to increase tensions and alienation. The acronym GRT is useful, but the people it refers to are far from a homogeneous group. English Romanichal Gypsies, Irish Travellers and more recent Romany immigrants from the European Union are culturally distinct populations with different experiences and needs. Some people with this heritage have chosen a settled way of life. The prejudice that many experience is not straightforward, and combines elements of racism with hostility to immigration and the EU. Tackling chronic economic disadvantage is an obvious first step towards reducing their marginalised status, and the sense of stigma that some vividly describe. The gulf that divides those in the UK who own assets, including residential property, from those who don’t is socially corrosive. The supply of affordable housing must be increased. To threaten Travellers with new criminal sanctions, as the police bill currently going through parliament does, while refusing to ensure that they have adequate space to live on, is punitive and likely to be self-defeating – reinforcing the cycle of exclusion. Other repressive measures introduced by the current government, including the requirement for voter ID, will also disproportionately affect those with nomadic lifestyles. Rather than forcing GRT people closer to the edge of society, the policy goal should be inclusion. Given their diversity, and the range of local conditions in the places where they live, mayors and councils ought to be tasked with finding solutions, and given resources to do so. Stronger efforts to improve outcomes for this severely disadvantaged group are overdue.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on anti-Traveller prejudice: the aim must be inclusion | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/08/the-guardian-view-on-anti-traveller-prejudice-the-aim-must-be-inclusion
2/9/2022,"Sometimes it takes a single dazzling athletic feat to ignite the Olympic spirit. China’s Winter Games may yet capture the imagination of the world’s spectators. The Tokyo Olympics, though unpopular in Japan due to fears of Covid’s spread, provided welcome diversion for many. Even so, they lacked the energy of previous Games, and so far Beijing’s event is still more muted. Winter sports such as curling lack the broad appeal of sprinting or swimming. China’s commitment to a zero-Covid strategy has kept its citizens well away from the Games, and the Games well away from its citizens. But above all, a pall has been cast by the oppression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, with the US, the UK and others mounting a diplomatic boycott. In 2008, the excitement of the moment largely drowned out domestic and overseas criticism of China’s human rights record. The charge sheet is longer and graver these days, and China harsher in responding. Beijing and the International Olympic Committee insist that the Games must not be politicised. Athletes have been warned against speaking out.  But hosting the Olympics is always a statement of national intent. In China, where the government breeds a nationalist ethos to cement its legitimacy, it is a particularly political act. If the 2008 Games were in part a statement to the world about the country’s re-emergence as a major global power, this year’s are primarily directed at a domestic audience. Chinese audiences appear enthused by at least some of the sport (especially following Tuesday’s triumph for Eileen Gu, the American-born skier now competing for China, who has become a lightning rod for Sino-American tensions) and Beijing can dismiss foreign criticism as an attempt to contain it; hawkishness in the US, latching on to the very real ethical objections, makes this dismissal easier. The Games project China as a nation that can efficiently present an impressive large-scale global event even in the midst of a pandemic. Torchbearers included a People’s Liberation Army officer wounded as he commanded a regiment in a border clash with India, and one of the athletes who lit the cauldron was a Uyghur skier, Dinigeer Yilamujiang. The party’s purpose is to “turn the sports arena into a stage for political legitimacy and a tool to whitewash all those atrocities [in Xinjiang]”, said Teng Biao, a human rights lawyer now living in exile in the US. The IOC’s already tarnished reputation has been further damaged by its responses to the horrifying and well-documented abuses in Xinjiang and the case of Peng Shuai, the tennis star who disappeared after accusing a senior official of coercing her into sex and has since said (while accompanied by a Chinese Olympic official) that it had all been an “enormous misunderstanding”. For many, whatever the joy brought by a global sports competition, the apparatus around it looks increasingly hard to justify. Beyond China, campaigners point to the forced displacement of communities, as in Rio; the heavy public spending on venues that are then little used; the contrast between the financial struggles of many athletes, the lavish conditions enjoyed by the IOC and the hefty profits made by broadcasters and sponsors. Whether or not the world warms to these Games, even the IOC may one day come to wonder if they were really worth it. And though Beijing wanted the Olympics, and still considers them useful, they do not look like the Olympics that it wanted.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Beijing’s Winter Games: a very political contest | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/08/the-guardian-view-on-beijings-winter-games-a-very-political-contest
2/9/2022,"Steve Bannon compared Donald Trump’s infamous escalator ride to announce his candidacy for the White House to Triumph of the Will, the Nazi propaganda film made by Leni Riefenstahl, according to a book published on Tuesday.  In Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party and Got Everything They Ever Wanted, the New York Times reporter Jeremy W Peters shows the former campaign chair, White House strategist and close Trump ally repeatedly invoking Hitler when discussing the 45th president. Bannon has frequently been a source for books about Trump, often to his own detriment as well as that of his sometime boss. His standing in Trumpworld was badly damaged, for example, by his participation in Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff’s 2018 White House tell-all. But Bannon, a far-right gadfly with a huge audience for his War Room podcast, worked his way back into Trump’s good graces, securing a pardon on fraud charges and playing a central role in advancing Trump’s lie that he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden because of electoral fraud. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to contempt of Congress, a criminal charge arising from his refusal to cooperate with the January 6 committee which could result in jail time. In Peters’ book, he is quoted as saying “Trump did not win in 2016 … Hillary Clinton lost” and complaining that Trump never recognised as much. He also complains that during the 2020 election, aides showed Trump misleading polling data in order to mask his deficit to Biden and thereby avoid outbreaks of fury. “It’s like showing Hitler fake armour divisions when the Reichstag is burning down,” Bannon says. The sometime documentary maker makes the comparison to Riefenstahl when discussing how Trump kicked off his takeover of the Republican party with his campaign announcement in June 2015. Riefenstahl is best remembered for Triumph of the Will, her landmark film about Hitler centered on the Nuremberg Nazi Party Congress of 1934. As Trump descended the elevator at his New York skyscraper, Peters writes, the film “flashed” through Bannon’s mind. “Triumph opens with a shot of Hitler’s aircraft high above Nuremberg as it begins descending through the clouds,” Peters writes. “When it touches down in a field, the massive crowd that has assembled to greet their leader rejoices. Hitler smiles as he drinks in the adulation. “Bannon thought that Trump’s entrance looked strikingly similar, and that he was witnessing someone with an uncanny sense for manipulating public perception.” The crowd which greeted Trump for his maiden speech as a 2016 presidential candidate was largely made up of actors, paid to pretend to support him. Trump has been linked to Hitler and the Nazis before. In 1990, Vanity Fair reported that he kept a book of Hitler’s speeches by his bed. “If I had these speeches,” Trump said then, “and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.” In July last year, the then president denied telling his former chief of staff John Kelly, “Well, Hitler did a lot of good things.” That remark was reported in Frankly, We Did Win This Election, a book by Michael Bender, of the Wall Street Journal, about Trump’s defeat and refusal to concede. In his book, Peters also quotes Bannon on the danger Trump posed to US democracy by 2020, when he advanced his lie about voter fraud well in advance of election day, and into 2022, as he promises pardons for January 6 rioters and threatens prosecutors with mob justice. “This makes the Tea Party look like a church social,” Bannon is quoted as saying. Bannon also muses on how Trump would “end up going down in history as one of the two or three worst presidents ever”. “It’ll be James Buchanan, Donald Trump and Millard Filmore,” Bannon is quoted as saying, in reference to two presidents of the 1850s who failed to stop the slide to civil war.",News/US news,"Bannon compared Trump escalator ride to Leni Riefenstahl Nazi film, book says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/08/bannon-trump-escalator-ride-nazi-leni-riefenstahln-hitler
2/9/2022,"Wars have unintended consequences. They rarely turn out the way the experts tell us they will. Just ask the officials who provided rosy scenarios for the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, only to be proven horribly wrong. Just ask the mothers of the soldiers who were killed or wounded in action during those wars. Just ask the millions of civilians who became “collateral damage”. That is why we must do everything possible to try and find a diplomatic solution to what could be an enormously destructive war in Ukraine.  No one knows exactly what the human costs of such a war would be. But there are estimates that there could be over 50,000 civilian casualties in Ukraine, and millions of refugees flooding neighboring countries as they flee what could be the worst European conflict since the second world war. In addition, of course, there would be many thousands of deaths within the Ukrainian and Russian militaries. There is also the possibility that this “regional” war could escalate to other parts of Europe. What might happen then is even more horrifying. But that’s not all. The sanctions against Russia, and Russia’s threatened response to those sanctions, could result in massive economic upheaval – with impacts on energy, banking, food and the day-to-day needs of ordinary people throughout the entire world. It is likely that Russians will not be the only people suffering from sanctions. And, by the way, any hope of international cooperation to address the existential threat of global climate change and future pandemics would suffer a major setback. We should be clear about who is most responsible for this looming crisis: Vladimir Putin. Having already seized parts of Ukraine in 2014, the Russian president now threatens to take over the entire country and destroy Ukrainian democracy. In my view, we must unequivocally support the sovereignty of Ukraine and make clear that the international community will impose severe consequences on Putin and his associates if he does not change course. With that said, I am extremely concerned when I hear the familiar drumbeats in Washington, the bellicose rhetoric that gets amplified before every war, demanding that we must “show strength,” “get tough” and not engage in “appeasement”. A simplistic refusal to recognize the complex roots of the tensions in the region undermines the ability of negotiators to reach a peaceful resolution. One of the precipitating factors of this crisis, at least from Russia’s perspective, is the prospect of an enhanced security relationship between Ukraine and the United States and Western Europe, including what Russia sees as the threat of Ukraine joining the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (Nato), a military alliance originally created in 1949 to confront the Soviet Union. It is good to know some history. When Ukraine became independent after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russian leaders made clear their concerns about the prospect of former Soviet states becoming part of Nato and positioning hostile military forces along Russia’s border. US leaders recognized these concerns as legitimate at the time. They are still legitimate concerns. Invasion by Russia is not an answer; neither is intransigence by Nato. It is also important to recognize that Finland, one of the most developed and democratic countries in the world, borders Russia and has chosen not to be a member of Nato. Putin may be a liar and a demagogue, but it is hypocritical for the United States to insist that we do not accept the principle of “spheres of influence”. For the last 200 years our country has operated under the Monroe Doctrine, embracing the premise that as the dominant power in the western hemisphere, the United States has the right to intervene against any country that might threaten our alleged interests. Under this doctrine we have undermined and overthrown at least a dozen governments. In 1962 we came to the brink of nuclear war with the Soviet Union in response to the placement of Soviet missiles in Cuba, 90 miles from our shore, which the Kennedy administration saw as an unacceptable threat to our national security. And the Monroe Doctrine is not ancient history. As recently as 2018, Donald Trump’s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, called the Monroe Doctrine “as relevant today as it was the day it was written.” In 2019, Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, declared “the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well”. To put it simply, even if Russia was not ruled by a corrupt authoritarian leader like Vladimir Putin, Russia, like the United States, would still have an interest in the security policies of its neighbors. Does anyone really believe that the United States would not have something to say if, for example, Mexico was to form a military alliance with a US adversary? Countries should be free to make their own foreign policy choices, but making those choices wisely requires a serious consideration of the costs and benefits. The fact is that the US and Ukraine entering into a deeper security relationship is likely to have some very serious costs – for both countries. We must vigorously support diplomatic efforts to deescalate this crisis and reaffirm Ukrainian independence and sovereignty. And we must make clear that Putin and his gang of oligarchs will face major consequences should he continue down the current path. At the same time, we must never forget the horrors that a war in the region would cause and must work hard to achieve a realistic and mutually agreeable resolution – one that is acceptable to Ukraine, Russia, the United States and our European allies – and that prevents what could be the worst European war in over 75 years.",Opinion/Opinion,We must do everything possible to avoid an enormously destructive war in Ukraine | Bernie Sanders,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/08/we-must-do-everything-possible-avoid-enormously-destructive-war-ukraine
2/9/2022,"“I’ve been accused of trying to homosexualize African men,” photographer Denisse Ariana Pérez told me as we discussed photos she’s showcasing in Fotografiska New York’s exhibit Nude, a worldwide selection of nude portraits as seen through the female gaze. Pérez specializes in photographing men, particularly Black African men, and she purposely works with her subjects to draw them out of dominant ideas of what men should be.  “I like the challenge of it,” said Pérez, “of confronting more traditional masculinity and in some way trying to bend it and question it, and to create a space for men to explore and go beyond what they have been allowed to.” Pérez makes her captivating, emotion-laden images by inviting her subjects to interact with water, letting them connect with a powerful, elemental force of nature that helps them to strip off the facades of identity and ego and go inwards toward the core of who they really are. “Water is an element that forces you to let go and embrace that letting go,” she said. “It’s the element that makes me connect to myself the most, I see it almost as a maternal element. I wanted to bring that to others, even if for just a brief moment.” Pérez’s work is emblematic of Nude’s aim, which is to upset dominant ideas of the nude body in art by showcasing what a diverse group of talented female photographers construe as nude portraits. “This show is kind of rare in our exhibition history,” Amanda Hajjar, director of exhibitions for Fotografiska New York, told me. “All of the artists in this show have this past of trying to turn the portrayal of the nude on its head. They’re all trying to do something different, and this is the outcome.” Bringing together 30 artists from 20 different countries who are shooting portraits all over the world, Nude offers a global perspective on the human form. Among other things, this broad cultural range lets the the exhibition wrestle with the question of how the meaning of a woman taking a nude portrait differs from society to society, as well as how the female gaze changes from one context to another. For instance, the Swedish photographer Julia SH takes the museum as her setting, upsetting traditional western concepts of how that institution regards the female body. She does this by placing plus-sized women into striking, balletic poses on pedestals and in galleries that are more accustomed to displaying young, thinner women. As Hajjar noted, SH’s works are “nothing like what you would have seen in a museum before”. Hajjar added that, “We’re interested in dealing with the ‘nontraditional’ female body and what that looks like.” While SH explores the nontraditional female body by putting larger women on pedestals, Joana Choumali does so through intricate, layered photographs of both real women and mannequins manufactured and displayed in her native Ivory Coast. These vivid, destabilized photos possess a fidgety energy, examining how the Awoulaba, or “beauty queen” mannequin propagates certain ideas of Black female beauty, contrasting it to the Taille fine, which adheres to westernized beauty standards. In the delicate interplay of reproduced forms Choumali combines stereotypes and reality to produce something that feels at once monstrous and without control, yet also familiar and mundane. As those two artists would indicate, the range of subjects and artistic styles in Nude is large. Israeli Elinor Carucci cinematically depicts middle-age domesticity, while Brazilian Angélica Dass uses a sociological bent to document the true diversity of skin tones that are flattened under generic words like Black and white. The Chinese artist Yushi Li subverts the male gaze by using Tinder to find male subjects, whom she then photographs with a desirous lens. Although certain themes do emerge among subgroups of the photographers, these are not – as one might imagine – based in geography. “It’s not like I can say the American artists all have the same aesthetic,” said Hajjar. “The photos in Nude don’t fit neatly in groups like that, which is really nice.” In addition to bringing stylistic and cultural expansiveness, Nude also attempts to broaden the narrative around the artistic nude by incorporating transgender bodies – their presence in the show lends all of the exhibition’s photos a degree of ambiguity. With nude models stripped of many of the signifiers denoting queerness or heteronormativity, it can be hard to tell the trans from the cis, the queer from the straight. And while it is true that some of the individuals in Nude, such as those photographed by Japanese artist Momo Okabe, “look trans” due to their combinations of genitalia and secondary sex characteristics, most of the photos in Nude are not so easily read as anything other than human. This raises the question of what exactly separates a trans body from a cis one and if the lines between the two are really as firm and fixed as current discourse presumes. As Okabe suggested to me, the demarcation depends more on “preconceived notions” about the LGBTQ+ community than anything innate about humanity, going on to conclude that “trans bodies to me do not differ from any other body.” “I have come to the realization that all people are inherently strange and mysterious. I believe people are beginning to understand that everyone is queer,” said Okabe. As a collection of work, Nude reveals much of what is inherently strange and mysterious about bodies that may not normally appear to be worthy of sustained artistic attention. It does so through a female gaze that does not dominate or take but rather empathizes and asks for consent. A rich interplay of human connection underlies the photographs in Nude, a freeing of self born of a genuine desire to see who other people really are. This is what allows these women to find views of the everyday that do not look so normal. “I see the female gaze as the incorporation of a lot of care into the photographing process,” Pérez told me, “a lot of very empathetic caring for the process and for the subjects and how they are portrayed.” She recounted the making of one of her favorite photos, of two boys whom she happened to meet on the street one day in Senegal. “One of them told me, I’ve never done anything like this before, but I’ve learned so much today. He said that was a day he would never forget. We had created something, he felt included in the process.” It’s that kind of closeness, coming out of a spirit of care and generosity, that one senses again and again in Nude and that makes this show such a revealing experience.

2/9/2022,"A former Conservative councillor who was thrown out of the party and now heads an anti-vax group peddling a range of conspiracy theories was among a mob that harangued Keir Starmer before the Labour leader was whisked away by police. As experts warned of a dangerous risk of extremism from a radicalised hard core as the pandemic wanes, the incident has focused attention on the rise of a plethora of protest groups.  One group present during Monday night’s fracas, Resistance GB, is led by the former north London Tory councillor William Coleshill, who draws on bogus justifications about ancient English “Common Law” to justify direct action. Coleshill, who was initially suspended from the Tory party, was last year filmed chasing Michael Gove through Whitehall, and has also confronted the Labour MP Jess Phillips and the BBC journalist Nick Watt. Members of social media channels run by Resistance GB, a self-styled journalism platform, continue to disseminate debunked conspiracy theories about the role of Starmer in protecting paedophiles such as Jimmy Savile – alongside other claims about the coronavirus pandemic and vaccines. After the incident involving the Labour leader – where a man and a woman were arrested for assault after a traffic cone was thrown at a police officer – users of the same social media channels expressed their belief that the confrontation had been “staged”. Other comments included descriptions of Starmer as a traitor and a “controlled Zionist”. Under a video of the incident, another said: “They are all scum. Going to need more than a few goons as personal protection if things get any worse.” Footage of the incident, bearing the Resistance GB logo, is being shared widely across anti-vaccine social media networks and beyond. The most popular post on Telegram, a social media platform favoured by many far-right activists, was shared by the rightwing media outlet Unity News Network. It had garnered 90,000 views less than 24 hours after Starmer was targeted outside parliament. It was shared by a number of prominent anti-vax figures including Kate Shemirani, a former nurse who was struck off the register last year, and Mike Yeadon, a former Pfizer employee who has spread misinformation about Covid-19. A further post from Yeadon’s Telegram channel, which claimed the incident was “set up theatre”, has received 10,000 views. The post appears to be a reference to “false flag” or “crisis actor” narratives, in which it is claimed protesters are paid actors trying to discredit a cause. Before his expulsion from the Conservative party, Coleshill was pictured in a selfie on one occasion campaigning with Boris Johnson. Clare De Silva, a Conservative councillor in the same Enfield ward that Coleshill once represented, claimed her one-time party colleague had been expelled “very early on” after his first or second council meeting. He had then sat as an independent for a time before being thrown out for non-attendance last summer. “He clearly had views that were not representative of the Conservative party and was not around for very long. Conspiracy theories are something which have unfortunately got to a lot of people,” she said. Much of Coleshill’s output makes it way on to Resistance GB’s YouTube channel, which has more than 72,000 subscribers. Interviews conducted in the wake of Coleshill’s pursuit of Gove include chats with anti-lockdown street protesters, who accuse ministers of treason and leaving “the people” with “only one option”. “If we was really as angry as these people think we are we would have strung him up by the closest tree … To think that is going to happen today, it isn’t, but if we continue going down this path of vaccinating children then these people are going to start to get angry … it’s the only way it’s going to end up,” said one. Experts at organisations such as Hope Not Hate said there was an overlap between many of those involved in the same groups and support for the far right, far left and conspiracy theorist movements such as QAnon. Gregory Davis, a researcher at Hope Not Hate, said that the anti-vaccine, anti-lockdown movement had been fuelled by fears of universal vaccine mandates and perpetual lockdown, neither of which had materialised. Davis added: “But as less-motivated activists begin to drift away the worry is that existing groups become more extreme with only the most committed and radicalised members remaining active. “Conspiracy theories have long been around in the UK – whether it’s David Icke or others making dark predictions – but there is now a new level of expectation and mobilisation that we have not seen in the past. People are emotionally invested in this activism in a way and on a scale that was not there before.” A Resistance GB spokesperson said: “Our news outlet is on the frontline of debunking government and mainstream media misinformation and disinformation, such as that promoted by the Guardian. “It is nonsensical and alien to the concept of personal responsibility for us to be blamed for any of the tens of thousands of comments hosted by tech platforms.”",News/UK news,Ex-councillor thrown out of Tory party among mob at Starmer incident,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/ex-councillor-william-coleshill-thrown-out-tory-party-among-mob-starmer-incident-resistance-gb
2/9/2022,"The pioneering visual effects artist Douglas Trumbull, best known for his work on 2001: A Space Odyssey and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, has died at the age of 79. His death was announced by his daughter Amy Trumbull, in which she said the “absolute genius and a wizard” died on Monday after “a major two-year battle with cancer, a brain tumor and a stroke”.  She added: “My sister Andromeda and I got to see him on Saturday and tell him that [we] love him, and we got to tell him to enjoy and embrace his journey into the Great Beyond.” Part of the team behind a short film called To the Moon and Beyond made for for the 1964 World’s Fair, Trumbull was hired to work on Stanley Kubrick’s epic science-fiction film 2001 after the director was impressed with its realistic visuals. Along with Con Pederson, Tom Howard and Wally Veevers, Trumbull was responsible for 2001’s boundary-pushing effects, including the eye-popping Star Gate sequence. Trumbull subsequently embarked on a career dominated by supplying inventive visual sequences for landmark films. A dystopian fantasy called Saturation 70 was never completed, but Trumbull had considerable success with his work on the Michael Crichton-scripted The Andromeda Strain, released in 1971, which then allowed him to direct his own film, Silent Running, about a spaceship filled with forests in an attempt to preserve Earth’s trees. Silent Running was a financial flop, but Trumbull still found himself in demand in 1970s Hollywood. He was in charge of special photographic effects on Steven Spielberg’s alien-visit sci-fi Close Encounters (for which he was nominated for his first Oscar) and as director of special photographic effects on Star Trek: the Motion Picture, having taken over after the previous effects supervisor failed to deliver what was required. Though no longer keen to work for other directors, Trumbull agreed to work on Blade Runner for Ridley Scott – largely because no spaceships were involved – and left the movie half way through to start work on his second directing project, Brainstorm. A sci-fi thriller about a device that allows people to experience others’ sensations, Brainstorm became notorious as the final role for actor Natalie Wood, who died in mysterious circumstances during the film’s production. Trumbull did manage to complete the film but it fared poorly at the box office on its release in 1983. Trumbull then distanced himself from Hollywood, working on the high-frame-rate ShowScan film format he developed, which found its niche in theme park rides and similar attractions, for which he was given a Scientific and Engineering Academy Award in 1993. Trumbull also became an executive at Imax for a short time. Trumbull was subsequently lured back to film-making by Terrence Malick, working on the “creation” sequence in Malick’s 2011 Palme d’Or winner The Tree of Life. Always restless, though, Trumbull continued working on new film formats, including the Magicam realtime video compositing system. In 2012 Trumbull was given an honorary Oscar to recognize his technological contributions to the film industry.",Arts/Film,"Douglas Trumbull, visual effects artist on 2001: A Space Odyssey, dies at 79",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/08/douglas-trumbull-2001-space-odyssey-dies-79
2/9/2022,"An Arkansas doctor accused of prescribing ivermectin to inmates in his state without their consent has been praised by local officials for a “job well done” despite widespread outrage at his actions. In January, the Arkansas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued Dr Robert Karas, the physician at Arkansas’s Washington county detention center, on behalf of four inmates who said they were given ivermectin to treat Covid-19 as a form of “medical experiment”.  “Plaintiffs ingested incredibly high doses of a drug that credible medical professionals, the FDA, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), all agree is not an effective treatment against Covid-19 and that if given in large doses is dangerous for humans,” the lawsuit said. According to the lawsuit, Karas told the inmates that the prescribed drugs “consisted of mere ‘vitamins’, ‘antibiotics’ and/or ‘steroids.’” The CDC, as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have put out advisories warning against using ivermectin for Covid-19, though it is a cause celebre for some rightwing figures and anti-vaxxers. Despite the lawsuit, some prominent local leaders of Washington county have lauded Karas for his Covid treatment efforts. On Monday, Patrick Deakins, a Washington county justice of the peace, introduced a resolution to a local quorum court’s jail and enforcement committee to praise Karas for his handling of the pandemic in Washington county jail. “I don’t know the science behind Covid and I’m not so sure anybody does. I’m certainly not a doctor and I’m certainly not a virologist, and none of us on this panel are,” Deakins said. He went on to add, “I don’t know the value of one treatment or the appropriateness of it is. I don’t know the efficacy of ivermectin and I don’t know the most useful ways to treat any one individual, and those are not the debate of this resolution, I just want what’s best for the health and safety of the county.” “While over 850 cases of the infection have been recorded in the Washington county detention center, Dr Robert Karas and Karas Correctional Health have effectively treated those cases which have resulted in zero fatalities from the virus,” the resolution said. According to the document, Karas provided “exceptional medical care” to inmates and that the “Washington County Quorum Court commends Dr Robert Karas and Karas Correctional Health for a job well done despite the unique challenges.” Despite the resolution getting passed by the committee, other local officials pushed back against Karas. “If you talk to individuals at our local hospitals that are treating patients after Dr Karas has treated them, they are very ill,” said justice of the peace Eva Madison. “The reality is that he doesn’t know … He can’t possibly know what the side-effects are of the treatment that he has given,” she added. “How can we tout nobody died when the individuals in this lawsuit claimed health consequences from what he did to them,” Madison said in reference to the inmates. “You can agree or disagree with the lawsuit, Dr Karas, but why in the world would this body endorse a practice that’s being challenged in court?” In the lawsuit filed by ACLU last month, inmates complained that they suffered from various side-effects after ingesting ivermectin, including vision issues, diarrhea, bloody stools and stomach cramps. The inmates were also subject to payment of fees for medical examinations that they sought after experiencing the side-effects. Karas, who has had numerous lawsuits filed against him over the years for allegedly providing inadequate and poor medical care to inmates, has filed a motion to dismiss ACLU’s lawsuit against him.",News/US news,Arkansas officials praise doctor accused of giving inmates ivermectin without consent,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/08/arkansas-doctor-ivermectin-treated-inmates-lawsuit
