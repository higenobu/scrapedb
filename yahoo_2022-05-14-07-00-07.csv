Roberto is due to give birth to his and Erika's son Noah any day now,‚Äù the caption continued alongside images that show Bete visibly pregnant, in Calvin Klein underwear, as his wife, wearing a CK sports bra and bottoms, clings to his arms at their bedside. ‚ÄúWe can reproduce biologically or from the heart‚Ä¶our place is to love and be loved,‚Äù the couple is quoted as saying in the ad.

Many of them threatened to boycott the brand, attacking the ad as a ‚Äúwoke campaign.‚Äù One user even wrote, ‚ÄúTime to ditch you, Calvin Klein.‚Äù Conservative talk show host Steven Crowder turned the ad into the butt of a joke, writing: ""We have a huge baby formula shortage!

Credit: Caters According to the Human Rights Campaign‚Äôs most recent survey, at least 20 millions adults in the United States could be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender ‚Äî representing nearly 8% of the total adult population. Of that number, more than 1% (or over 2 million) identify as transgender. There is currently no data on how many transgender men give birth. Dr. D Ojeda, senior national organizer at the National Center for Transgender Equality, which advocates to change policies and to increase acceptance of transgender people, says that trans men have an array of options when it comes to starting families, but due to their specific needs being vastly under-researched and underreported, that message often doesn't translate to society at large. ""We assume that because you're on testosterone, you can't get pregnant, when in reality there's a good chance you can,"" Ojeda, who uses they/them pronouns, tells Yahoo Life. (It should be noted that not all transgender men use testosterone, just as not all keep their uteruses.) Furthermore, due to the lack of education, they say trans men often gather false information about their own bodies and reproductive health. ""There are a lot of trans men, transmasculine, nonbinary people who actually pause their hormones so they can get pregnant,"" Ojeda explains, adding that this step is sometimes unnecessary and suggesting that trans men seeking pregnancy should always speak to their doctor before pausing their hormones. Dr. Maddie Deutsch, associate professor of Clinical Family & Community Medicine at the University of California San Francisco, and medical director for UCSF Transgender Care, elaborated on the topic further on UCSF's website in an overview about hormone therapy and the reproductive system. ""Testosterone may reduce your ability to become pregnant but it does not completely eliminate the risk of pregnancy,"" Deutsch wrote. ""Transgender men can become pregnant while on testosterone, so if you remain sexually active with someone who is capable of producing sperm, you should always use a method of birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancy."" Adding to that point, Deutsch says that while on testosterone, a trans man's periods may change its normal cycle and that it may become difficult for ovaries to release eggs, depending on how long they have been on hormone therapy. In these cases, the piece points out, ""you may need to consult with a fertility specialist and use special medications or techniques, such as in vitro fertilization, to become pregnant."" Of course, these treatments are not always covered by insurance, and can be expensive. Ojeda, whose organization has placed pressure on health insurance companies to better cover the needs of trans folks through its latest campaign, Protect Trans Health, argues that when families like Fernandes and Bete are visible, it's an opportunity for trans people to know they're just as deserving to have a family as anyone else is. ""I applaud Calvin Klein for being that intentional because that language shift is so important,"" they say. ""It could improve the way we view people, especially when it comes to access to health care and family planning."" Fernandes and Bete have since had their baby, documenting the birth and sharing the moment on their Instagrams.    A post shared by Roberto Bete (@roberto_bete)    A post shared by Erika Fernandesü¶Ñ (@erikafeeh) ""There's a lot of stigma that comes with being trans,"" Ojeda says in regards to family planning. ""There's this assumption that we're anti-children or anti-family. I think that's part of the vitriol that has been perpetuated all the way from the attacks on gender affirming care ‚Ä¶ to abortion care."" Ojeda adds that the ""urgency"" for men in power to ""control bodily autonomy,"" an idea that's been particularly present in recent days following the potential reversal of Roe v. Wade, doesn't just include women ‚Äî but affects trans people and trans families as well. ""People see a family they've never met before, and never had an understanding of, and that makes them uncomfortable,"" they explain of the transphobia arising from the recent ad. ""What Calvin Klein is doing is amazing,"" they continue, explaining that a lot of trans people out there really do want to start a family but seldom feel empowered to do so ‚Äî something they hope the ad can help change. ""It's going to have a lot of positive impact, especially for health care and when it comes to reproductive services.""",Health/Yahoo Life,"Yep, trans men can get pregnant.

5/14/2022,"The government wants you to wait on getting that fourth vaccine shot, and it won‚Äôt say exactly why. Americans eligible for a second COVID booster shot‚Äîincluding those 50 and older and the immunocompromised‚Äîmay want to consider waiting before getting a fourth jab, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday, as it launched an online tool to help individuals determine if they qualify. Per the agency‚Äôs booster guidance website, updated Friday, those who are eligible for a second booster should consider how likely they are to get ‚Äúvery sick‚Äù from the virus based on preexisting health issues and potential community exposure. ‚ÄúIf you are eligible, can you wait?‚Äù asks the guidance, urging those who have had COVID-19 in the past three months or who feel ‚Äúthat getting a second booster now would make you not want to get another booster in the future‚Äù to consider holding off. ‚ÄúA second booster may be more important in the fall of 2022, or if a new vaccine for a future COVID-19 variant becomes available,‚Äù the guidance states. Individuals ages 50 and older, those 12 and older who are immunocompromised, and those who received two doses of Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs Janssen vaccine are eligible for a second booster shot, according to the CDC. Updated guidance encourages those eligible to think again based on ‚Äúthe benefits and risks of a second booster,‚Äù but does not expound. The CDC did not respond to questions from Fortune on Friday as to what the potential risk and benefits are of a second booster, in particular, or whether there are concerns about the continued efficacy of current vaccines, especially in light of immune-evading Omicron subvariants. It also failed to respond to questions about potential supply concerns, given a lack of renewed COVID funding by Congress. The government is running out of money to fund its efforts to combat the virus, and a $22.5 billion March ask by the Biden administration to fund, among other things, boosters and variant-specific vaccines, was pared down to $10 billion. But it‚Äôs still stuck in limbo, caught up in immigration politics, The Hill reported this week. Meanwhile, Politico reported Friday that the White House is preparing to ration COVID vaccines in light of the continued funding impasse. ‚ÄúAmong the sacrifices being weighed are limiting access to its next generation of vaccines to only the highest-risk Americans‚Äîa rationing that would have been unthinkable just a year ago, when the White House touted the development and widespread availability of vaccines as the clearest way out of the pandemic,‚Äù Politico‚Äôs Adam Cancryn wrote, adding that White House officials are ‚Äúincreasingly concluding that these types of difficult choices will soon have to be made.‚Äù A March 15 White House memo warned that Congress‚Äô failure to fund additional COVID efforts ‚Äúwill have severe consequences as we will not be equipped to deal with a future surge.‚Äù U.S. COVID cases have risen steeply in recent weeks, and hospitalizations have also been on the rise. Earlier this month the White House warned of a coming surge this fall and winter that could more than double the amount of COVID infections the U.S. has recorded thus far. ‚ÄúWithout funding, the United States will not have enough additional boosters or variant-specific vaccines, if needed, for all Americans,‚Äù the March White House memo warned.

5/14/2022,"(Reuters) - Ukrainian military authorities loaded the bodies of Russian soldiers collected after fighting in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions onto refrigerated rail cars on Friday. Volodymr Lyamzin, the head of Ukraine‚Äôs civil-military cooperation, said his country was acting in accordance with international law and was ready to return the bodies to Russia. ""According to the norms of international humanitarian law, and Ukraine is strictly following them, after the active phase of the conflict is over, sides have to return the bodies of the military of another country. ""Ukraine is ready to return the bodies to the aggressor,‚Äù he said. Lyamzin said there were several refrigerator trains stationed in different regions across Ukraine where the bodies of Russian soldiers were being kept. Several hundred bodies were being stored at a facility on the outskirts of Kyiv filmed by Reuters. ""In this refrigerator train several hundred bodies of Russian occupiers are kept. Most of them was brought from the Kyiv region, there are some from Chernihiv region, and from some other regions too,"" Lyamzin said. Moscow calls its invasion of Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize a neighbour threatening its security. Ukraine denies posing a threat and says Russia is waging a war of aggression that has killed thousands of civilians, uprooted millions of others and destroyed cities and towns since the conflict began in late February.
