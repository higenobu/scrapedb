1/25/2022,"The Octoraro reservoir is a lake in south-east Pennsylvania where locals fish, kayak and marvel at bald eagles and owls. It’s a picturesque scene but in the neighbourhoods nearby there are placards which carry warnings. “No to Big Water”, the signs say, and “Save CWA”.  The signs show the local opposition to a hostile takeover effort by Aqua Water, one of the country’s biggest private water companies, against the public utility Chester Water Authority (CWA) which owns the reservoir and bordering woodland. The CWA relies on the watershed to provide drinking water to around 200,000 people in Delaware and Chester counties. It’s an award winning public utility that is financially robust, and delivers safe, clean and affordable water. It does not need a bailout. Campaigners say the battle here, which started in 2017, should be a wake up call for residents around the US as privatization often means higher bills. “This takeover is about putting money over people’s needs, it’s corporate greed,” said Delaware county resident Santo Mazzeo, 42, a high school maths teacher with three children working two jobs to make ends meet. “Water is the stuff of life, it’s a fundamental human right which should be run by the people for the people, not for profits,” added Mazzeo, who in his spare time delivers the anti takeover signs to neighbours. But CWA is vulnerable because the sale could help rescue one small city in Delaware county on the brink of bankruptcy. Private companies mostly target financially distressed local governments and utilities looking for cash injections to clear debts, upgrade infrastructure or fund popular public services without raising taxes. Industry friendly laws means this often comes at a cost for residents: nationwide, one in 10 people currently depend on private water companies, whose bills are on average almost 60% higher than those supplied by public utilities. In Pennsylvania, Aqua already owns numerous utilities and its most recent rates proposal would, if approved by the state regulator, lead to almost half a million households paying on average 17% more for their drinking water than they currently pay. Wastewater bills would rise by 33%. CWA warns that the Aqua deal could cost it’s customers more than $1bn in higher bills over the next 20 years – and threatens public access to the reservoir and its landholdings, 2000 acres that protects the watershed and wildlife. “We pride ourselves on providing quality water that our residents can afford. We’re not in any trouble, and we’re the best custodians of this precious natural resource because we don’t have to worry about shareholders or dividends,” said Cindy Leitzell, chair of the CWA board. Nationwide, dozens of new privatisation deals are under consideration, according to Global Water Intelligence, with 14 major acquisitions (>$10m) pending across five states with a combined value of almost $800m, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. “For more than a decade, these corporations have waged a successful lobbying campaign to support state laws that facilitate privatisation and ensuing water rate hikes…. the public must be on the guard to protect their essential water services from the corporate vultures trying to exploit fiscal distress,” said Mary Grant, the right to water campaign director at Food and Water Watch (FWW). Analysis by FWW of four of Aqua’s largest Pennsylvania acquisitions found rates increased by an average of 280% – the equivalent of 8% per year – after adjusting for inflation. “Water corporations have become increasingly aggressive and even the best-run water systems like CWA are under attack, which should sound the alarms for communities nationwide,” Grant said. Federal funding for water systems peaked in 1977 since when municipal utilities have mostly depended on rate hikes and credit to fund infrastructure upgrades, water safety mandates and climate adaptation. As a result, the cost of water and sewage has risen sharply over the past decade or so, making this basic service an increasing burden for many Americans, a Guardian investigation found. Still, the funding shortfall remains gob smacking, which has been further exacerbated by billions of dollars in unpaid bills during the pandemic. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s, drinking water, wastewater and stormwater systems need at least $744bn over the next 20 years just to comply with existing federal law. An additional $1tn is required by 2050 to protect water infrastructure from extreme weather events and sea level rise linked to global heating, according to the National Association of Clean Water Agencies. But CWA is not struggling. Its well-planned upgrades – such as building a new pump station on higher ground to avoid flooding and a multimillion dollar state of the art leak detection system – have helped avoid unexpected costs and catastrophes. CWA recently increased its rates for the first time since 2010. “This is a first class operation which is not financially stressed in any shape or form because we’ve always looked ahead and don’t answer to shareholders. Quality and quantity are problems in this industry, but we have both which makes us a prize that Aqua wants,” said Paul Andriole, CWA’s vice-chair. At its water treatment plant, where a dozen or more awards are displayed in the lobby, 60m gallons of water drawn from the reservoir and Susquehanna river are processed every day. It’s a 24/7 operation with an in-house laboratory to aid compliance with environmental standards. “We meet or exceed EPA standards, we do not have quality or safety violations that could justify our sale. It’s a struggle but we can handle it,” said Anita Martin, chief lab technician. CWA was created by the city of Chester – Pennsylvania’s oldest city and a former industrial powerhouse which has experienced significant economic and population decline since the mid 20th century. The majority Black city is an environmental justice hotspot: its 32,000 or so residents are burdened with poor air quality caused by heavy industries including the country’s largest trash incinerator, and have limited access to green spaces and healthy affordable groceries. The city of Chester has been subject to state financial oversight since the mid-1990s due to mounting debts and inflated police pensions, but was pushed to the brink of bankruptcy in 2020 after a major revenue stream, the casino, was closed due to Covid. A large cash injection – along with reducing retiree benefits – is crucial to making the city solvent, according to Michael Doweary, the court-appointed receiver. “This is a difficult situation but CWA is the city’s only asset large enough to generate enough money to meet its debt obligation and reinvest in the city which for years has been on a shoestring budget.” But, critics say the sale would hurt city residents, around a third of who live in poverty. Based on Aqua’s proposed statewide rate increase for its existing customers, Chester city residents could be saddled with bills more than double what they currently pay, according to a comparison tool devised by CWA. The average water bill burden would then be 3.3% of median household income, a level generally deemed unaffordable by the UN. (The mayor has said some of the sale money could be used to offset rate increases for a decade.) Kearni Warren, 45, an energy justice organiser who lives in Chester, said: “We don’t have clean air, greenspaces or healthy food options, but affordable clean water is the one healthy thing we do have and the city wants to sell it off… It will harm residents and thousands of ratepayers outside the city.” Chester city created CWA but the vast majority (81%) of its customers now live outside city boundaries – in the suburbs of Chester and Delaware counties which have separate local governments. Given this, the city’s right to sell CWA has been contested. Last September an appeal court ruled that the fate of CWA rested in the hands of the city as it created the utility. CWA lodged an appeal to the Pennsylvania supreme court. In an amicus brief supporting the appeal, FWW argues that Aqua’s actions constitute a hostile takeover, and that CWA should be treated as a public trust responsible for managing water supplies for the benefit of the people, not as a commodity. In 2016, Pennsylvania became the first state to pass legislation which allows private companies to buy public utilities for more than they are worth – relying on what’s known as fair market value rather than depreciated value. Companies can recoup the over-priced investments by passing on the cost to all their customers through statewide rate hikes, meaning residents pay while shareholders reap the rewards. It led to a merger frenzy in Pennsylvania and at least 11 states have since passed similar laws, driving up water and wastewater bills, according to the Government Accountability Office. In some states, healthy public utilities – not just those in financial trouble – are eligible for takeover. In Pennsylvania, a third of residents are served by private water companies – triple the national average – and their bills are on average 84% more than those with public providers. In 2017, a year after the fair market law (Act 12) was passed, Aqua made an unsolicited bid to CWA for $320m – which the nine-person board unanimously rejected after concluding there would be no benefit to its residents. As Aqua persisted, in 2019 CWA made a counter offer worth $60m to help bail out the city in exchange for protection from future hostile bids. Aqua filed a lawsuit to stop the deal. There are currently three offers on the table including $410m from Aqua – the second highest but city’s preferred bid which includes a $12m advance irrespective of the litigation outcome. Michael Doweary, Chester city’s court appointed receiver, said his team is exploring ways to keep the water authority in public hands, but CWA’s $60m bid isn’t enough. (Aqua’s rival, Pennsylvania American Water, has bid $425m.) With more than a dozen pending lawsuits, the case could be tied up in court for years. If sold, it would be up to the court to determine the city’s share of the proceeds. Aqua is now a subsidiary of Essential Utilities, the second largest publicly traded US water and wastewater corporation currently valued at $12.5bn. It provides drinking water and wastewater to around 3.25 million people (1m households) in eight states, with over half in Pennsylvania where the company is headquartered and has close ties to the state government. Aqua has at least half a dozen new deals pending regulatory approval in the state. In addition, the Guardian understands that the company has approached Bucks county’s water and sewer authority (BCWSA), another robust public utility, about a potential $1bn offer, which would be among the biggest water privatisation deals in US history affecting half a million residents. (Aqua said it has not made a bid; the county commissioner office and BCWSA declined to comment). In a statement, Aqua said its actions related to CWA did not amount to a hostile takeover and that it was committed to keeping the reservoir open to the public. It said that public utilities like CWA are unregulated and typically untransparent about rates and capital investments. “Aqua’s rates reflect its true cost of service, which includes investments necessary to provide high quality service, safe working conditions and protection of the environment. Lower rates often indicate deferred maintenance and old, outdated facilities, which can lead to service interruptions and water quality and wastewater discharge violations.” New Garden Township is a scenic rural area in Chester county with well-to-do families, retirement villages and migrant communities concentrated around multiple mushroom farms. Its wastewater system, which supplies around half the township’s residents, was Aqua’s first in the state after the fair market law changes – in a deal worth $29m. Some of the money was used to build a new police station and offset future tax increases. If Aqua’s rate hike is approved by the regulator, residents will see average wastewater bills rise by around 37% later this year – much higher than the rate cap promised during initial negotiations. This has generated anger and mistrust among residents opposed to the takeover. Going forward, residents will likely share the cost of Aqua’s future acquisitions including CWA, the community’s water provider. Margo Woodacre, 72, a retired social worker and part time English teacher, said: “It’s the dishonesty and unfairness that’s made me go door to door educating businesses and residents, so they know what’s coming if we lose CWA.”",News/US news,‘Corporate vultures’: how Americans fearing higher water bills are fighting takeovers,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/25/corporate-vultures-americans-fearing-higher-water-bills-fight-takeovers
1/25/2022,"He has played a wizard, a supervillain and the great Shakespearean leads – twice starring as Hamlet, 50 years apart – but Sir Ian McKellen has declared himself ready for another challenge in his ninth decade: a stage musical. Talking to Mishal Husain on Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday, the actor said he had never had a list of parts he wanted to play but he was still working his way through different types of theatre production. “There are a few left – one would be the musical,” he explained. But can he sing, asked Husain. “In the bath, in the shower, in private,” he replied. “I have sung occasionally – I did a pantomime at the Old Vic a few years back.” In that 2004 production of Aladdin he played Widow Twankey and sang “in a fashion” he added. A full-blown musical would be something else. “I can hold a tune but I’m not a proper singer,” he reflected. “I’m available but incompetent.”  The star, who turns 83 this year, is no stranger to on-screen musicals – he played Cogsworth, the major-domo who is transformed into an enchanted clock, in Disney’s 2017 film Beauty and the Beast and he played Gus the theatre cat in the 2019 film of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s stage hit Cats. McKellen is about to play a sleuth for the first time – and for one show only – in a fundraising production at the Park theatre in north London. He is one of the surprise guest stars taking on the role of an investigator in a murder mystery spoof. Part of the fun of Whodunnit (Unrehearsed) 2 – the return of a format first used at the Park in 2019 – is that the actor playing the detective each night has not read the script in advance and is fed their lines through an earpiece. Early in his career, McKellen appeared in two Agatha Christie plays at the Belgrade theatre in Coventry – but as a victim and a butler rather than a detective. The actor said it was a playful if disquieting prospect to be cast as an inspector without any rehearsal and without having seen the script. “I don’t feel I’ve got much to prove in my career any more,” he added. “Why not just do the things I enjoy doing?” The Park theatre has assembled an all-star lineup for the show, with one-off appearances as the detective to come from Dame Emma Thompson, Gillian Anderson, Clarke Peters and Suranne Jones. McKellen had his own casting suggestion: Sue Gray, the veteran civil servant conducting the inquiry into Downing Street parties. “I wonder if Sue Gray is going to be free by the time the show opens. She might be a very good solver of problems,” he said with a chuckle.",Arts/Stage,Ian McKellen keen to star in a stage musical: ‘I’m available but incompetent’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/25/ian-mckellen-stage-musical
1/25/2022,"Good morning. Joe Biden has said there was “total” unity among western powers after crisis talks with European leaders on how to deter Russia from an attack against Ukraine, as 8,500 US troops are put on high alert.  “I had a very, very, very good meeting – total unanimity with all the European leaders,” the president told reporters shortly after a one hour and 20-minute video conference on Monday with allied leaders from Europe and Nato. In London, Boris Johnson’s office also said “the leaders agreed on the importance of international unity in the face of growing Russian hostility”. The UK prime minister had warned of “unprecedented sanctions” against Moscow should an invasion take place amid growing tensions over Ukraine. Who else was on the call? The leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Poland and the EU also took part in the crisis talks. The scale of the number of children who have lost out on their schooling during the pandemic is “nearly insurmountable”, according to UN data. Up to 70% of 10-year-olds in low- and middle-income countries cannot read or understand a simple text, up from 53% pre-Covid, the research suggests. Classroom closures continue to affect more than 635 million children globally, with younger and more marginalised children facing the greatest loss in learning after almost two years of Covid, according to the UN children’s agency, Unicef, which called for intensive support to help students recover. Across the world, children have lost basic literacy and numeracy skills and their mental and physical health has suffered. In South Africa, schoolchildren are between 75% and a whole school year behind where they should be. What has the impact been like in the US? Learning losses have been seen in the US, including in California, Colorado, Tennessee, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Maryland. Can you give an example of this? Yes. In Texas, two-thirds of children in grade 3 (age eight to nine) tested below their grade level in math in 2021, compared with half of children in 2019. The unemployment rate has tumbled dramatically since the height of the pandemic but older workers are still struggling to find work despite all the reports of worker shortages. About 5.7 million workers ages 55 or older lost their jobs in the US in March and April 2020, 15% of workers in an age demographic that has also experienced the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths. The unemployment rate for workers aged 65 and older hit a record rate of 7.5% in 2020. A June 2021 analysis by economists at the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at The New School found at least 1.7 million more older workers than expected retired due to the pandemic. The analysis encouraged policy solutions such as expanding Medicare eligibility to the age of 50, expanding social security benefits, and creating a department dedicated to older workers at the US Department of Labor. Monique Morrissey, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, explained there are differences among affected older workers. She said: “Job losses are concentrated among non-college-educated workers in lower-paid jobs and are disproportionately also jobs that have high contact with the public.” Taylor Swift has criticised Damon Albarn, the lead singer of Blur and later of Gorillaz, on Twitter after the British musician told the LA Times she “doesn’t write her own songs”. Swift said she wrote all of her songs and his “hot take is completely false and SO damaging”. Albarn later apologised. Marilyn Manson has denied raping the actor Evan Rachel Wood on the set of the music video for Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand). In a new documentary, Wood said during a “simulated sex scene”, Manson, born Brian Warner, “started penetrating me for real”. The Jeopardy! contestant Amy Schneider has broken yet another record this week. The engineering manager from Oakland, California, scored her 39th win on last night’s episode, giving her the second-longest winning streak of any contestant. The fate of more than 700 boys and teenage detainees has become central to the siege of a Kurdish-run prison in Syria that was overrun on Friday by jihadists, who are accused of using the boys as human shields. There have reportedly been multiple deaths and injuries among the child prisoners. The stress, anxiety and isolation of the Covid-19 crisis, combined with widespread contamination in the illicit drug market from the synthetic opioid fentanyl, has worsened the overdose epidemic in the US. More than 100,000 Americans died of an accidental overdose in the year ending April 2021, a sharp increase compared with the previous year. The country’s first two sanctioned overdose prevention centers (OPCs) opened in New York on 30 November and are already saving lives. By scouring the world for cheap labour, US clothing brands are not merely opportunistic, they are also sometimes actively parasitic. Honduras is a case study: one in which US corporations and the US state department have worked together for decades to bring cheap garments to American consumers, framing job creation as a blessing for the Honduran economy while simultaneously engaging in political interventions that keep citizens poor. The sinking of the X-Press Pearl cargo ship off Sri Lanka’s west coast last May caused wave upon wave of nurdles, the tiny pellets that are the raw material of the plastics industry, to wash ashore. Millions – or even billions – of them have turned the country’s golden beaches black. A UN report called the incident in May 2021 the “single largest plastic spill” in history, with about 1,680 tonnes of nurdles released into the ocean. Most of them were partly burnt and contaminated with chemicals and debris from the ship spill, posing even more of a threat to marine life – and the local community. A woman in Michigan checked her spam email folder – and found out she had won a $3m lottery prize. Laura Spears, 55 and from Oakland county, said she bought a ticket and a few days later was looking for a missing email from someone and checked her spam folder. “That’s when I saw an email from the lottery saying I had won a prize.

1/25/2022,"A “knob-throwing” event has been cancelled because the size has become too much to handle for the organisers. The Dorset knob-throwing contest involves competitors hurling a traditional Dorset knob – a hard biscuit – as far as they can. The record throw of 29.4 metres (96 ft) was set in 2012.  This is now the third year in a row the organisers have been forced to cancel; in 2020 there was no venue available and in 2021 Covid put an end to the festivities. But this year organisers have admitted that the event, due to be held on 1 May in Cattistock alongside the Frome Valley food festival, has become too popular for the organisers to manage. Other events on the day include knob-eating, knob-painting, a knob and spoon race, guess the weight of the big knob, knob darts and a knob pyramid. A statement on Facebook from the Dorset knob-throwing committee said: “It is with great sadness that the Dorset Knob Throwing and Frome Valley food festival is unable to go ahead on 1 May 2022. “We had over 8,000 people attend the 2019 event, meaning it has reached such a size that it simply cannot be run by a small village committee. We’ve looked at various options but sadly couldn’t make any of them work for this year for many reasons. “We also sadly lost the support of our event management team late in 2021 and agreements with Moores Biscuits to provide the biscuits for the event’s games also took much longer than anticipated. “We hope the event can return in years to come.” The Dorset knob started life sometime before 1860 when the Moores family began baking in West Dorset, according to Moores biscuit-maker. After the day’s bread baking was finished it was the custom to make Dorset knobs by adding butter and sugar to the leftover dough and hand rolling them in small buttons. They were then baked in the dying heat of the bread oven to dry them out like rusks. The Dorset knob was originally named after hand-sewn Dorset Knob buttons that were still being made in the last revival of the once-thriving cottage industry. According to the Dorset knob-throwing committee, the rules for the contest are as follows: Three Dorset knobs per go, furthest knob thrown is measured; Use only Dorset Knobs provided; Standing throw from marked standing point; Underarm throwing only; One foot must remain on the ground during throwing; Distance of the furthest knob only measured within the designated throwing zone, which is 5 metres wide x 32 metres long, marked in 2 metre zones, with use of measure in between marks to determine distance thrown; Dorset knob measured at final resting place; If Dorset knob breaks upon landing it will be the umpire’s decision of final resting place.",News/UK news,Dorset knob-throwing festival cancelled after becoming too popular,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/25/dorset-knob-throwing-festival-cancelled-after-becoming-too-large

1/25/2022,"Australia’s richest person, mining magnate Gina Rinehart, has picked up an Australia Day gong as has media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s former Australian chief. Rinehart’s appointment as an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) “for distinguished service to the mining sector, to the community through philanthropic initiatives, and to sport as a patron” is likely to spark controversy.  The honours, which include the awards in the Order of Australia, were handed out to over 700 recipients, including a record number of women. Hancock Prospecting’s executive chair has been criticised for declaring climate change education programs “propaganda”. Shortly after that, she declared herself in favour of renewable energy, but warned (without foundation) that a rush to reduce emissions would cost taxpayers billions. According to reports from May she is Australia’s biggest landholder. Rinehart supports a range of charities including the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the Georgina Hope Foundation, which she chairs. Australians would be more aware of her support for the Olympics. She ran prime-time advertisements at last year’s Tokyo games, and supports swimming, volleyball and rowing athletes. According to her website, she is one of Australia’s biggest Olympics fans, contributing $10m annually. Another article on her website says her personal investment in athletes has been a “game-changer”. Australians are appointed an AO “for distinguished service of a high degree to Australia or to humanity at large”, according to the governor general’s office. Last year tennis great and Pentecostal minister Margaret Court, a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, was made a companion of the Order of Australia. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, an advocate of same-sex marriage, said there was “no shortage of irony” that he received the same honour. Broadcaster Kerry O’Brien rejected his own honour in protest at Court’s appointment. The year before, controversy again marred the awards protest. The Council of the Order of Australia reviewed the honours for sex therapist Bettina Arndt and writer Mike Carlton after separate public outcries. The council ultimately decided they could retain their awards. More recently, Turnbull has joined another former prime minister, Kevin Rudd, to condemn the Murdoch media empire, and its executives have been grilled in a Senate inquiry that is due to report in March. John Hartigan, who left Murdoch’s employ a decade ago, has also been appointed an officer in the Order of Australia for “distinguished service to the media industry, to Indigenous welfare, and to sport”. As with many media executives, Hartigan had various run-ins with politicians – he once told Rudd to “pull his head in” after Rudd called Murdoch outlets a “cancer”. Hartigan, now 74, started out as a copyboy. He spent more than 40 years at News Limited, including for NewsCorp UK and NewsCorp US. He worked his way up to CEO in 2000 and chair in 2005. He carried both roles until he resigned in 2011. (News Limited became News Corp Australia in 2013.) Commonly known as “Harto”, he has been an Australian Paralympic Committee director since 2014 and a trustee of the Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust since 2011. Hartigan said he was “humbled” that the citation was not just for doing his job but for “being able to assist in a couple of areas that are important to me”. He lists those as the Indigenous Marathon Project, the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation, as well as his position on the board of Anindilyakwa Land Council. “(They’re) the things I’m most proud of, although I haven’t achieved anything close to how many people I admire [have],” he said. “I just regret that our kids aren’t taught more about both Indigenous languages and Indigenous history in our schools. “It’s so wrong we don’t have a more fundamental understanding. “We can’t even get an Indigenous voice in parliament up and running. I’m far from being a handwringer or bleeding heart, I think I’m pragmatic in recognising that.” Hartigan said he regretted many things about his career, such as missed opportunities as the newspaper industry was transformed by digital products. There are “so many things” he could have done better, he said, including while struggling to start his own one-man newspaper in the 80s. But he said throughout his media career there was not a day when it wasn’t the “best job in the world”, from being a copy boy to being the chairman. “It was a lot of fun,” he said. “I felt more like the CEO of organising parties than the CEO of something commercial.” Guardian Australia contacted Hancock Prospecting for comment.",News/Australia news,Gina Rinehart and former News Ltd chief John Hartigan receive 2022 Australia Day honours ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/gina-rinehart-and-former-news-ltd-chief-john-hartigan-receive-2022-australia-day-honours
1/25/2022,"The tornado struck Joplin, Missouri, in May 2011 with such fury that afterward, even those who had lived here their entire lives struggled to recognize it. The nearly mile-wide storm wiped away entire neighborhoods and killed 161 people in less than an hour. It felled trees, leveled buildings and flung power lines and vehicles all over the roads with winds of more than 200mph.  “We lost all our landmarks,” said Ryan Stanley, who was born in Joplin and serves as its mayor. “I was looking at our church and didn’t recognize it.” But more than a decade later, Joplin’s transformation has been a positive one. A locally led recovery effort has created a thriving city with a larger population, new educational institutions, more businesses and thousands of houses that are better able to withstand extreme weather. Joplin has managed to achieve an often elusive post-disaster goal: not just restoring what was there before, but building a more resilient community. As the climate crisis intensifies natural disasters, residents here say Joplin offers crucial lessons in how cities can recover and how the US can better prepare. Whether it be towns leveled by wildfires in the west, or by tornadoes like the ones that hit Kentucky last month, catastrophe can also present an opportunity to improve. Jane Cage, a small business owner who became a leader of Joplin’s rebuilding efforts, says communities face a choice between rebuilding as quickly as possible, often the same way things were before, or taking the time to plan and build in a more resilient way. “People want to return to normal,” she said, “but at the same time the disaster very often presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a community to build back better.” By the time it dissipated, the 22 May 2011 tornado was among the deadliest in US history. The storm had violently torn through Joplin, killing people seeking refuge wherever they could find it, such as a Pizza Hut manager who shepherded people into the restaurant’s freezer and a family scrambling for safety inside a Home Depot. It had destroyed a third of the city, including a hospital and several schools, and displaced more than 9,000 residents. The recovery ahead was monumental: Joplin had lost 4,000 homes, more than 500 businesses and critical infrastructure such as segments of the sewage system. The storm affected everyone in the city of 50,000 in some way, and took a toll on mental health. Eighteen people died by suicide as a direct result of the tornado, said Stephanie Brady, the executive director of the Community Clinic of Southwest Missouri, who co-chaired the long-term recovery team. Calls for domestic violence grew in the first year. The scale of the catastrophe was so staggering, federal officials warned the city it should expect to lose at least 25% of its population. But the city insisted on a message of unrelenting hope and optimism for its future. Residents mobilized from the earliest moments, bringing injured people to safety and cleaning streets. Volunteers showed up in large numbers. And Joplin had an advantage, Brady said – it was a town built on strong connections. “We have a spirit in our community that we are going to work together,” she said. “Our city works well with our county, the city works well with the hospitals.” Officials and residents were quick to organize, helping displaced residents secure housing, supplies and mental health support. Another key to recovery was soliciting feedback about what people wanted the new Joplin to look like. Committees such as a citizen advisory team, chaired by Cage, were formed to seek input. Residents had a vision: a community with more parks, trails and sidewalks, which the city incorporated into its recovery plan. “After a disaster that’s the government’s focus: we’re going to get you back to where you were,” Brady said. “We said: ‘we’re gonna use this as an opportunity to be better than we were before’.” In Joplin, rebuilding took place at a rapid pace, with an average of five houses built a week since May 2011, according to city figures. More than 182,000 people volunteered in the town, including building hundreds of homes. Those involved with the recovery efforts say that by harnessing federal funding and the national spotlight it gained during the early days of the tornado, the city was able to grow. Cage and Brady point to new parks, an art center, a medical school and incoming dental school as indicators of how Joplin has changed. Officials also updated design standards so that houses would be better able withstand extreme weather, and schools could provide shelter to residents in the event of another tornado. “All of these things came out of looking at how we make our community better,” Brady said. Most businesses reopened, and more than 300 new businesses opened between May 2011 and February 2016, according to the city chamber of commerce. The city’s immediate organizing played an important role in its success, said Robert Olshansky, an expert in post-disaster recovery. “It was a huge tornado that took out lots of different parts of Joplin. It affected businesses, it affected the economy, it affected a lot of vulnerable people,” Olshansky said. “What was impressive is, a place that had never really been through this before, they self-organized very effectively. They took control. They didn’t just wait for the state emergency management agency or Fema.” Not every community can rebound in the same way, Olshansky cautions. Small towns that were declining before a disaster will probably return as smaller, still-declining places unless they can find a formula that works for them, he added. In Paradise, California, where affordability and natural beauty drew people to the area, increasing costs and severe wildfire damage have deterred some residents from returning, though the community has acted admirably in its recovery efforts, Olshansky said. Joplin’s rebuild was not without error. The city partnered with a master developer run by two men the US Securities and Exchange Commission had already accused of misrepresenting investments. The firm failed to deliver and Joplin took the company to court trying to get back more than $1m, the Springfield News-Leader reported. “I would encourage other communities to be very careful of who they partner with,” Stanley said. “It was a frustration and an embarrassment.” Leaders of the rebuild efforts have sought to share their lessons with other cities – Cage now teaches at the Fema Institute about the role of community in disaster. Those in Joplin and outside it see the city as an important example of what’s possible. In the years since, Brady helped found the Disaster Leadership Team, which travels to different communities to aid them in developing a recovery plan. The team has deployed to Texas after Hurricane Harvey and to Paradise after the Camp fire, where they’ve offered up their own experiences. “You have to know your neighbors, you have to work together, you have to not bring ego into it. We had things we wish hadn’t happened, things we wish we had done differently,” Brady said. “But communities can recover.”",News/World news,Lessons from a tornado: what one American town can teach others about disaster recovery,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/lessons-from-tornado-joplin-missouri-disaster-recovery
1/25/2022,"Former New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons, wheelchair tennis champion Dylan Alcott, swimming Olympic gold medallist Emma McKeon and chef Maggie Beer are among the recipients of Australia Day honours this year. The honours, which include the awards in the Order of Australia, were handed out to over 700 recipients, including a record number of women.  Almost half – 47% – of the honours list recipients were women, the highest ever percentage, with 45% for service to local communities. Fitzsimmons, who currently serves as commissioner of Resilience NSW, was honoured as an Officer of the Order of Australia for his work in leading NSW RFS during the Black Summer bushfires of 2019/20. “I’m very humbled and grateful that someone would take the time to nominate me,” he said. “Our lives were changed forever by that fire season, and I’m forever grateful and in awe at the remarkable effort of volunteers and members of partner agencies to save and protect as many people as possible.” “It was an awful time, but when we are at our worst, we see the very best in people.” Over 6% of NSW, or around 5.5m hectares of land, was burned during the crisis, with over 2,500 firefighters deployed at its peak. Fitzsimmons said receiving the honour had led him to reflect on the second anniversary of the fires, having attended memorial events last week. “Going to the memorial brings up so many raw emotions, and connecting with people and catching up with people, it’s had a profound effect on so many of us.” Fitzsimmons says he continues to remember the 26 people, particularly the seven volunteer firefighters, who lost their lives during the bushfires. “These are things that will stay with me forever,” he said, adding he was accepting the honour on behalf of everyone involved in the rescue efforts. Other recipients of the award include two-time world champion netballer Catherine Cox, who told Guardian Australia she was honoured to be recognised as a Member of the Order of Australia. “I won’t lie to you, I shed a tear when I found out,” she said. “Because it is such a big deal and the people I know that already have one are exceptional people in their field, so to be considered in the same sort of league is mind-blowing.” Cox has won 108 caps with the Diamonds since her debut in 1997, and was part of the Australian team that won the world championship in 2007 and 2011, as well as Commonwealth Games gold in 2002. Although she retired six years ago, Cox said the honour had made her think back on her career, achievements and an early change of home. “It’s certainly brought me back to a stage of reflection, it’s nice to take a moment just to think about everything that’s happened.” “My mum actually reminded me the other day that I was actually born in New Zealand. We moved here when I was six, but she said, ‘isn’t it amazing, a little Kiwi girl that’s come to Australia is now being recognised with one of its highest honours.’” “I thought it was pretty cool as well.” Principal medical geneticist and medical director at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Prof Leslie Burnett, was also appointed a Member of the Order of Australia, and said it was a great surprise to see his work honoured.

And then to see your contributions noticed, to see that it was what the target community wanted, it’s very pleasing and exciting. “It’s a way of knowing that everything you’ve been striving for has been worthwhile.” Burnett’s work focused on two key areas: safety and quality at laboratories, and introducing genetic testing and screening in Australia. “I’ve spent a large part of my life pursuing safety and quality in medicine, and trying to develop laboratories that reach new and previously unattainable standards of excellence. “If it’s not better than it’s ever been, it’s not good enough for me.”",News/Australia news,Australia Day honours: Shane Fitzsimmons and Emma McKeon recognised with record number of women recipients,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/australia-day-honours-shane-fitzsimmons-and-emma-mckeon-recognised-with-record-number-of-women-recipients
1/25/2022,"Bob Dylan has sold his entire back catalogue of recorded music to Sony Music Entertainment, as well as the rights to multiple future releases, in a deal rumoured to be worth between $150m and $200m (£111m–£148m), Variety reports. The deal covers all Dylan recordings dating from 1962, including his self-titled debut album, which celebrates its 60th anniversary in March, and future releases and reissues in Dylan’s celebrated Bootleg Series.  Dylan signed to Columbia in October 1961. Rob Stringer, chairman of Sony Music Group, said they were “tremendously proud and excited to be continuing to grow and evolve our ongoing 60-year partnership. Bob is one of music’s great icons and an artist of unrivalled genius.” The sale would also address “new ways to make his music available to his many fans today and to future generations”, said Stringer. Dylan said in a statement: “Columbia Records and Rob Stringer have been nothing but good to me for many, many years and a whole lot of records. I’m glad that all my recordings can stay where they belong.” In January, Music Business Worldwide analysed new figures from MRC Data to find that catalogue music (defined as older than 18 months) claimed 73.1% of the US music consumption market in the second half of 2021, and 69.8% of total album consumption. The deal continues a concerted period of estate management for the 80-year-old songwriter. In 2020, Dylan sold his song catalogue to Universal Music Publishing for a rumoured $400m and donated his personal archives to the Bob Dylan Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Dylan is currently facing a lawsuit from an anonymous woman who alleges that the musician groomed, inebriated and sexually abused her when she was 12 years old. He has formally denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit “a brazen shakedown … false, malicious, reckless and defamatory” and the woman’s alleged timeline of events a “chronological impossibility”.",Arts/Music,Bob Dylan sells entire recorded catalogue to Sony Music Entertainment,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/25/bob-dylan-sells-entire-recorded-catalogue-to-sony-music-entertainment
1/25/2022,"The Manchester City midfielder Jill Scott has joined Aston Villa on loan until the end of the season. The 34-year-old, who has more than 150 caps for England, is expected to make her debut against Chelsea on Saturday and the Villa manager, Carla Ward, described the decision as a “no-brainer”.  “When we heard of Jill’s availability it was a no-brainer,” she said. “To have the chance to acquire one of England’s most decorated footballers is a chance we couldn’t turn down. We are delighted to announce the loan signing of @JillScottJS8 from Manchester City! ✍️ “Jill will bring so much to this group, not only on the pitch but I see her having a huge impact off it, too. We have some hugely exciting young talents coming through, so for them to learn from someone of Jill’s stature will be massive.” Scott, who has been with City since 2014, winning the WSL title in 2016, spent the second part of last season on loan at Everton.

1/25/2022,"There seems to be no end to Dylan Alcott’s achievements. A multi-talented athlete, disability advocate, storyteller and media personality, he’s got 29 grand slam titles under his belt (and is taking a shot at a 30th this week). Alongside Paralympic gold and silver medals in tennis and basketball, he was awarded a medal of the Order of Australia in 2009 when he was just 18. And on Tuesday he was awarded the title of Australian of the Year – yet another huge accolade for the now 31-year-old.  Alcott has made headlines for all kinds of reasons throughout his career – here’s a quick primer on some highlights. Don’t let the beer Alcott downed from his champion’s trophy at the US Open last year distract you from the achievement it was celebrating: Alcott had just won a Golden Slam – that is, he won four grand slam tennis titles plus a gold medal in the same calendar year. He’s the first male player to have achieved this, in any form of tennis – prior to 2021, only Steffi Graf had done it. “Thanks for making the dreams of a young fat disabled kid with a really bad haircut come true because I can’t believe I just did it!” he told the crowd after his win. “I just can’t believe I just won the golden slam!” Iconic @DylanAlcott 🍻 pic.twitter.com/FMge1Gactt Later, he said: “There was no chance I wasn’t going to scull that beer.” Alongside his sporting career, Alcott is an avid music fan – Triple J listeners may know him as a presenter on Weekend Arvos, and a regular guest on Triple J breakfast. Alcott is a wheelchair user, after an operation to remove a tumour on his spine when he was three weeks old left him a paraplegic. His love of music and passionate advocacy for disability led to the creation in 2018 of AbilityFest, which aims to “use music as an inclusive platform to normalise disability”. AbilityFest is just the tip of the iceberg, though. Part of what the festival does is raise money for Alcott’s foundation, which uses the funds to help young Australians with disabilities fulfil their potential – whether that’s in sport, music, business or anything else they show aptitude for. Supporting young disabled people to get where they want to go is Alcott’s bag. He’s also the founder of Get Skilled Access, an organisation which states its purpose is to “create a new generation of disability inclusion that is equitable for all.” Alcott has apparently also crowdsurfed in his wheelchair – and says he’s only fallen out once. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning As Emma Kemp wrote in Guardian Australia today: “If he has to protest, he will. In 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic he accused the US Open of ‘disgusting discrimination’ over its decision to drop the wheelchair event. When the tournament backflipped and had it reinstated, he praised them wholeheartedly.” Alcott has been open throughout his career about how his disability – and sport – has affected his life and his mental health, not least in his autobiography, Able. “I hated my disability, I didn’t even want to be here any more and then I found tennis and it changed and saved my life,” he said in New York last year. “The reason I get out of bed every day is to change perceptions,” he once told former ABC News Breakfast presenter Fran Kelly. “People [with disability] can live normal lives. They deserve opportunities in education, employment, in their personal lives, in eating, travelling, dating.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app “The time has come, I feel redundant, I feel old, washed up,” he said in November. In a moving speech – after which he popped a bottle of champagne and, of course, necked it – he explained how proud he was of the work he’d done on the court, and what he hoped to do off it. “Being a good tennis player is not the priority of my life. Being a good person is. Being a good advocate and changing perceptions for people like me so they can live lives they deserve to live and get the opportunities I have had. I am so lucky,” he said. Alcott smashes the bubbly at retirement announcement pic.twitter.com/afu5BO7pWQ “It’s the next generation’s turn to dominate and get the recognition they deserve,” he said. “I’ve known this day was coming for a while. It’s been an incredible ride and I think the time has come to move onto other things that I do. In saying that, I’m going to train my arse off for the next two months and try and go out on a high.” “There’s no way I could finish my career a few weeks ago because the US Open was not my home,” Alcott said in November. “This is my home and the Australian Open changed my life. What better way to finish than in my home in front of crowds?” Perhaps with an eighth title win?

1/25/2022,"Clear winter skies and the promise of a recent evening’s beautiful sunset led photographer Simone Engels to a nearby park on Vancouver Island. But as she trained her lens on the pinkish hue of the landscape of the Pacific coast, she was shocked to see a large, iceberg-like shape on the horizon. “It was this huge, shiny, three-dimensional tubular structure,” she said. “It looked so real.”  Engels, who previously studied geography, cycled through possible explanations, including that a large piece of ice had improbably drifted down from Alaska, miraculously passing through narrow straits and dodging archipelagos. But if an iceberg was in the area – especially one of that size – it would surely have made local news, she told herself. “I was trying to pin this together in my head, and I really couldn’t come up with an explanation,” she said. “It just looked so odd and I was nearly convinced that it really was an iceberg I was staring at.” With no one else around to confirm the mysterious sighting, she snapped an image and for nearly half an hour, watched the hulking white shape on the horizon before it disappeared from sight. Engels shared the image online, hoping to get an explanation. The photograph initially stumped locals – including a friend who specializes in ice geomorphology. The image soon went viral and Engels learned that the mysterious iceberg was really a mirage. She was actually viewing the Cheam mountain range on the mainland of British Columbia, nearly 200km (124 miles) away – and beyond the horizon from where Engels was standing. The illusion was caused by what is known as a “superior mirage” which is caused during a temperature inversion, when a band of warm air rests on a layer of cold air, bending light rays downwards. Light from the setting sun was reflecting off the range and bending down, placing the range on the horizon. At a distance, the snow-covered peaks looked eerily similar to a towering iceberg. Engels has seen previous mirages in the area, but nothing as crisp and stable as the mountain range that January evening. “We live in some challenging times right now with a pandemic and it’s really important for people to realize that there are natural wonders out there to be discovered,” she said of the experience, which left her in awe. ‘You can find natural wonders in your own backyard when you get out there and explore.”",News/World news,‘It looked so real’: ghostly ‘iceberg’ was a wonder of nature – just not an iceberg,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/ghostly-iceberg-canada-superior-mirage
