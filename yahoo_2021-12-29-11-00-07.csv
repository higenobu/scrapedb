12/29/2021,"Two Dallas detectives searched a 25-year-old Chicago woman’s suitcase at Dallas Love Field Airport on Dec. 2 and seized more than $100,000 from the bag. Detectives say they smelled a drug odor before they searched the woman’s luggage without her permission but did not arrest her and haven’t charged her with a crime. The woman was flying domestically and had a layover at the Dallas airport. Civil asset forfeiture allows police to seize, then keep or sell the property they allege was involved in a crime, leaving someone whose property was seized to go to court to try to get it back. A police K-9 alerted two detectives with the Dallas Police Department to a black, checked-in suitcase secured by a lock. The dog, named Ballentine, is trained to pick up the scent of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine. A police report does not name what city the suitcase was headed for, The Dallas Morning News reported. However, the bag was set to be transferred to another plane. According to the report, detectives felt they had to act quickly with a search warrant because it “would not be obtained in time and could cause an undue burden to the passengers and or airlines,” the report says. According to the report, detectives found shipping bags wrapped in blankets containing $100, $50, $20, $10, $5 and $1 bills inside the suitcase. There were no clothes or other items in the luggage. When detectives found the woman in the airport terminal, she told them she was a dancer who worked in real estate and that she had sold a house. Convinced the woman obtained the money through an illegal drug deal, detectives seized the cash. The woman signed a property receipt for the money, police say. Police did not arrest the woman or charge her with a crime. The Dallas Police Department celebrated the seizure on social media. A post to the department’s Facebook page showed Ballentine posing beside the cash. “We need to get him some treats! K-9 Officer Ballentine does it again! On 12/2/21, the Love Field Interdiction Squad seized over $100,000 with the help of Ballentine. Good job, Ballentine!” the caption read. The FBI has confirmed it took possession of the money. Under Texas law, authorities can seize assets without charging a person with a crime. Black Americans are disproportionately searched and targeted for seizure, a South Carolina study found. Up to 80 percent of people whose assets are seized by authorities are never charged with a crime. Institute for Justice attorney Dan Alban told CBS11 that, while it’s legal to travel with any amount of money domestically, agencies consider flying with large amounts of cash suspicious. “Unfortunately, both TSA and DEA have policies that treat what they consider to be large amounts of money as presumptively suspicious and indicative of criminal activity,” Alban said. Travelers leaving or flying into the U.S. must declare amounts of cash of at least $10,000. Since 2000, $68 billion in civil assets have been seized by the government, according to the Institute for Justice. A spokesperson for the police department told CBS11, “Detectives assigned to Love Field are thoroughly trained and experienced in various criminal interdiction techniques and tactics, many of which were utilized during this incident. Due to the nature of this seizure, as well as where it occurred, it will be subject to follow up investigation with our Federal partners.” More news from our partners: A Retired Black NYPD Officer Who Claims Her Captain Raped Her Repeatedly for One Year Sues City for $35 Million ‘I Just Wanted to Learn How to Make Money Myself and with My Child’: How One Man is Building Wealth with Vending Machines 2022 NFL Pro Bowl Is A Family Affair For The Diggs Brothers | Bosa And Kelce Brothers Will Also Play In Las Vegas",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,‘Suspicious’: Dallas Detectives Seize $100k from Woman at Airport Without Charging Her With a Crime,https://news.yahoo.com/suspicious-dallas-detectives-seize-100k-000000484.html
12/29/2021,"Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, one of the Republican Party’s staunchest devotees to the lie that the 2020 election was “stolen” from former President Donald Trump, continued to spread such claims this week — and in the process delivered one of the more honest statements about voter fraud and stolen elections any Republican lawmaker has made this year. “How to steal an election,” Paul tweeted Monday night, before quoting an article from The American Conservative. “‘Seeding an area heavy with potential Democratic votes with as many absentee ballots as possible, targeting and convincing potential voters to complete them in a legally valid way, and then harvesting and counting the results.’” The attached piece, which purportedly described Democrats’ and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s efforts to “steal” Wisconsin for President Joe Biden last year, failed to provide any proof of nefarious behavior: Instead, it documented efforts to “encourage and Increase Absentee Voting” and “dramatically expand strategic voter education & outreach efforts, particularly to historically disenfranchised residents.” As Paul’s tweet helpfully noted, all of these efforts were perfectly legitimate: The phrase “legally valid” is prominently featured in the sentence he chose to excerpt. Routine audits of Wisconsin’s elections, meanwhile, produced no evidence of fraud or irregularities in last year’s contest. But proof of fraud is not the point of this claim or any other Paul, Trump and various Republicans have made over the last year — or, really, over the last decade. As Paul’s tweet stated more clearly than Republicans typically do, their claims about voter fraud, stolen elections and “election integrity” are merely euphemisms for the GOP’s actual belief that “people voting for Democrats” is enough to render an election entirely illegitimate. A Democratic victory is, by definition, the result of theft. This is the core belief of the modern Republican Party, which reacted to the 2020 election by spreading lies about election fraud, attempting to overturn Trump’s loss, and fomenting a riotous insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, all because Trump lost what numerous Republican, Democratic and independent election observers have repeatedly called the safest, most secure and most audited election in American history. When that didn’t achieve their desired result, they institutionalized the aims of the insurrection, passing more than 30 new laws to restrict voting rights and asserting new levels of partisan control over local and state election systems ahead of the next presidential contest.  These efforts have all primarily targeted voters that tend to favor Democrats ― Black people, Latinos, Native Americans, college students, people with disabilities, and anyone who lives in cities or other localities that typically vote blue. And they are all obviously rooted in Republican anger that too many voters voted for Democrats, not that anyone might’ve cast ballots illegally. In Georgia, Republicans added stricter voter ID requirements to absentee ballots, tightening access to a vote-by-mail program the GOP created more than a decade ago in a way they never felt was necessary until Biden became the first Democrat to win the state since 1980. In Arizona, the GOP-controlled legislature made similar changes to absentee ballot laws they originally enacted, after Biden notched Democrats’ first presidential victory there in more than two decades. In Texas — where it’s already harder to vote than in most other states — they barred drive-through voting and imposed other new voting restrictions in an effort to ward off potential Democratic victories in the near future.  Republicans and their conservative allies have also targeted election officials and offices in key states, purging or stripping power from those who made it too easy to vote or refused to go along with Trump’s election gambit, part of a broader effort to bend the 2024 election to their liking ― or try to overturn the result if they need to. In Wisconsin, the subject of Paul’s tweet, Republicans have sought to undermine the electoral system they just reformed less than a decade ago and are attempting to forcibly replace the state’s top elections official.  None of this will prevent the sort of nefarious behavior their countless utterances of “voter fraud” are meant to evoke, both because that sort of behavior is exceptionally rare in American politics and because actual voter fraud has never been the target of their ire. But neither will insisting to Republicans, or to conservative voters who believe their claims, that voter fraud doesn’t actually occur succeed in thwarting the GOP’s attempts to suppress votes and subvert American democracy.  It’s painfully obvious what Republicans are trying to do, and why. Paul was simply, if perhaps inadvertently, candid about it: To the modern GOP and an increasingly large share of its conservative base, there’s no such thing as a “legally valid” vote for a Democrat, and no such thing as a legitimate election if a Democrat wins it.

12/29/2021,"Photos of a mysterious “bright blue mineral” discovered in a historic Michigan copper mine have piqued the attention of many as what it is remains unidentified. The mystery substance was captured on rock walls of Adventure Mine’s third level near Greenland, Michigan, photos posted on Facebook show. “This bright blue mineral has not been positively identified as of this post but it is a secondary mineral that is caused by a reaction with air and water,” mine officials said on Sunday, Dec. 26. As followers of the post continued to guess what the mineral might be, officials replied in a comment that officials are “skeptical of what it really is.” “Foreign metals were introduced to the area by means of garbage left in the mine,” they said. “Tin, Zinc, Lead, Iron, and other metals that were left in the water would have the opportunity to precipitate into the water and through a very slow process join to other metals.” Adventure Mine owner Matt Portfleet told Michigan Live that the third level where the mineral was found was filled with groundwater up until this past fall when his crew finished pumping out water. As he and his workers explored the newly accessible level, he says they found “small patches of a bright blue mineral on the freshly exposed rock.” He said it would be difficult to positively identify minerals like this as they can quickly decompose when surrounding water is removed, according to Michigan Live. Adventure Mine operated from 1850 to 1920, according to its website, as “miners removed more than 11 million pounds of native copper from the ground.” There are 13 levels to the mine, though mine officials say their pumping equipment will not go much further down. The township of Greenland is in north Michigan, just south of Lake Superior. ‘What is up with the poop smell?’ People can’t handle the stink in this Missouri city Rare ‘hole-punch clouds’ open up the skies of upper Midwest.

12/29/2021,"Huge cargo ships carrying liquid gas that were destined for China have changed course and are now heading towards the UK as Europe remains trapped in a major supply crunch. While the Continent’s energy crisis and high prices have attracted ships away from other parts of the world, the new arrivals are now bringing prices down. Benchmark Dutch front-month gas fell for a fifth day yesterday, dropping as much as 9.2pc in Amsterdam. The UK gas price rocketed to a record 470p per therm last week, up from just 50p in April, but has since fallen to under 270p. James Huckstepp, managing analyst at S&P Global Platts, said tankers are flocking towards British shores in a move that is “critical to ­tempering even more extreme prices and demand destruction in Europe”. He said: “We are seeing cargoes previously destined for Asia now diverting to the UK. This is particularly the case for those cargoes originating in the US, given the journey between the US and Europe is much shorter than that to Asia.” The number of US tankers heading for European ports jumped by one third last weekend, according to Bloomberg, with 20 vessels bearing American gas heading for Europe and another 14 heading in the general direction of Europe while awaiting final orders. The number of cargoes travelling to the UK and elsewhere in Europe will raise hopes that new supplies can ease the energy crisis and help lower gas prices, which have declined after soaring to record highs last week. That will bring some relief to UK energy bosses, who met Downing Street officials this week for crunch crisis talks. Ahead of the meeting, Stephen Fitzpatrick, the boss of Britain’s second-largest supplier Ovo Energy, warned that bills were “almost certain” to ­double to £2,000 per household. It is understood that the Government could facilitate a deal that would see the industry given access to a £20bn fund, which they could repay at a rate of £2bn a year over 10 years. Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, said European and UK prices have surged above Asian ­liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices, attracting volumes away from China. The additional supplies will provide some much-needed respite ahead of looming winter shortages. However, one Singapore-based trader told S&P Global Platts earlier this month that they are not sure “how sustainable these diversions to the Atlantic will be”. The cost of energy in Europe has been soaring this year due to low levels of gas storage, tight supplies from Russia and lower output from clean energy sources, in part because of weak wind speeds. Some 26 retail energy companies have gone bust since August. The country gets most of its gas via pipes connected to the North Sea, ­Norway and continental Europe, but in ­normal times it also gets about 20pc via ships in the global market. Russia has been accused of withholding extra pipeline gas supplies to mainland Europe in recent months, in an attempt to pressure Germany into starting up its new pipeline, Nord Stream 2. It comes as new data show that shipments of gas from Russia to the UK increased this year. As of last week, Russia had sent 29 shipments of LNG to the UK during 2021 – compared to 22 a year earlier – according to data from S&P Global Platts Analytics. It marks the second highest annual figure since the first Russian shipments to the UK in 2017. Proponents of the North Sea industry argue that the Government could boost Britain’s energy security by granting permission for more domestic oil and gas drilling. About 10 licenced North Sea projects are expected to be up for development approval and final investment decisions in next year, but are likely to draw opposition from climate change activists. Protesters have been emboldened by Shell’s decision earlier this month to pull out of the Cambo field development. Its partner, Siccar Point Energy, subsequently paused the project. In October, Friends of the Earth, using analysis from campaign group Uplift, found in total about 30 licenced UK offshore oil and gas projects are in line for development approval by 2025. The Government has said it supports domestic production as oil and gas still fulfils about 75pc of total UK’s energy needs – fuelling most boilers, cars and almost 40pc of UK power supply. However, it has also introduced a “climate compatibility” checklist that new oil and gas projects need to pass if they are to get a licence. Supporters of North Sea drilling say it results in lower emissions than importing gas from other parts of the world.",World/The Telegraph,Cargo ships divert gas from China to Britain,https://news.yahoo.com/cargo-ships-divert-gas-china-131518083.html
