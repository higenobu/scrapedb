3/25/2022,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Thursday he'll vote against Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's historic nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. Jackson, the first Black woman ever nominated to the nation's most powerful court, went through confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week. ""I enjoyed meeting the nominee. I went into the Senate's process with an open mind. But after studying the nominee's record and watching her performance this week, I cannot and will not support Judge Jackson for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court,"" he said. He criticized Jackson's refusal to publicly oppose the possibility of expanding the number of seats on the Supreme Court, saying: ""I assumed this would be an easy softball for Judge Jackson, but it wasn't."" Among other concerns he raised Thursday, McConnell indicated Jackson has a relatively small track record of rulings for senators to study, particularly on constitutional matters, compared to former President Donald Trump's three Supreme Court appointees. He suggested that's important because ""for decades, activist judges have hurt the country by trying to make policy from the bench."" ""This has made judicial philosophy a key qualification that senators must consider,"" he said. ""If the nominee had a paper trail on constitutional issues, perhaps it could reassure us. But she doesn’t. ...Judge Jackson has been on the D.C. Circuit for less than one year. She has published only two opinions."" East Louisville projects: Affordable housing advocates brace for opposition as East Louisville projects spur debate McConnell, who voted against confirming Jackson to her current role on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., previously called for an ""exhaustive review"" of Jackson, whom President Joe Biden nominated to fill Justice Stephen Breyer's seat on the court. He offered a critical assessment of her recent judicial work before that Senate review began. ""Since then, I understand that she has published a total of two opinions, both in the last few weeks, and that one of her prior rulings was just reversed by a unanimous panel of her present colleagues on the D.C. Circuit,"" McConnell said last month. ""I also understand Judge Jackson was the favored choice of far-left dark-money groups that have spent years attacking the legitimacy and structure of the Court itself.""

3/25/2022,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Pamela Smart, a former high school employee convicted of recruiting her teenage lover to kill her husband, was denied a sentence reduction hearing Wednesday, more than 30 years after a sensational trial that inspired books and a Nicole Kidman movie. Smart was 22 and working as a high school media coordinator when she began an affair with the 15-year-old student who shot and killed her husband, Gregory Smart, in 1990. Although she denied knowledge of the plot, she was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and other crimes and sentenced to life without parole. The student, William Flynn, and three other teens cooperated with prosecutors, served shorter sentences and have been released. Smart’s request was rejected in a 5-0 vote by a New Hampshire state council. It’s the third time Smart has asked the council for a hearing. Now 54, she has exhausted all of her judicial appeal options. “I am absolutely convinced that there’s no evidence or argument” to grant a commutation request, councilor Janet Stevens said during a short discussion. One thing that was different in this petition is that Smart apologized to her husband’s family for the first time. “I offer no excuses for my actions and behavior,” she said in a recorded statement that was sent as a DVD to the attorney general’s office in December. ""I’m to blame."" “I regret that it took me so long to apologize to the Smart family, my own family, and everyone else. But I think that I wasn’t at a place where I was willing to own that or face that,” she said. “I was young and selfish and I wasn’t thinking about the consequences of what I was doing.” In the state’s response, Jeffery Strelzin, associate attorney general, wrote that Smart has told a false narrative for over 30 years and just because she’s decided to change that now “does not mean that she has truly changed and fully acknowledged all the crimes she committed as an accomplice and conspirator in her husband’s murder, and the perpetrator of witness tampering.” “Decades of lies cannot be undone in an instant by newfound claims of remorse and a vague acceptance of responsibility,” Strelzin, who opposed a sentence reduction, added. A cousin of Gregory Smart said she is not sure what Pamela Smart is apologizing for. “In her petition, she apologizes to those 'impacted by (her) actions and misjudgment' and admits that it took her decades to accept this responsibility,"" Val Fryatt said. “She needs to define what those actions and misjudgment truly represent. When she is ready to apologize and truly admit to the crimes she committed, our ears are wide open."" Eleanor Pam, a spokesperson for Smart, called the council's decision “disappointing"" and said the evidence presented on Smart's behalf was “overwhelming, and any fair reading of it by fair-minded persons should have resulted in a hearing."" Smart submitted her petition in 2021. She can try every two years. The trial was a media circus and one of the first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between a school staff member and a student. Joyce Maynard wrote “To Die For” in 1992, drawing from the Smart case. That inspired a 1995 film of the same name, starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix. Flynn testified that Smart told him she needed her husband killed because she feared she would lose everything if they divorced. He said she threatened to break up with him if he didn’t kill Gregory Smart. In addition to earning two master’s degrees in a Bedford Hills, New York, prison, Smart has tutored fellow inmates, has been ordained as a minister and is part of an inmate liaison committee. Many letters of support from inmates, supervisors and others were included in her application. Besides saying that she is remorseful and has been rehabilitated, Smart’s appeal noted pardons granted to three other women in New Hampshire in murder cases. But the state countered that the cases involved less serious second-degree murder charges and the other women did not entice a juvenile to commit murder.",U.S./Associated Press,Pamela Smart denied chance at freedom decades after killing,https://news.yahoo.com/pamela-smart-denied-chance-freedom-164213523.html
3/25/2022,"The United Kingdom’s Foreign Office signaled Thursday that it believes Russia is using the Wagner Group, a shadowy Kremlin-linked mercenary organization, to hunt down and kill Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Since the start of the war, Zelenskyy has said he is Russia’s “No. 1 target,” and U.S. officials have voiced repeated concerns about his safety. But the Ukrainian leader has refused to flee his country, choosing instead to stay in Kyiv, the capital, as it continues to ward off a Russian takeover. The alleged founder and leader of the Wagner Group, Dmitry Utkin, is believed to have Nazi sympathies ― an irony if true considering how Russian President Vladimir Putin has justified his aggression in Ukraine by claiming it needs to be “de-Nazified.” British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss announced that the Wagner Group numbered among dozens of individuals and businesses to be newly sanctioned, describing it as “the organisation of Russian mercenaries reportedly tasked with assassinating President Zelenskyy.” Also facing sanctions are Alfa Bank, five other financial institutions and a variety of individuals, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s stepdaughter, who reportedly lives in a multimillion-dollar London flat. The European Union slapped sanctions on the Wagner Group and other entities accused of funding it back in December, citing serious human rights abuses by members. Russia says it does not use the mercenary group, which it refers to simply as a private company. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, that plausible deniability comes in handy: “The Russian government has found Wagner and other private military companies to be useful as a way to extend its influence overseas without the visibility and intrusiveness of state military forces.” European security officials suggested in February that hundreds of Wagner Group fighters had been trickling into eastern Ukraine to lay the groundwork for the war, according to The New York Times. Ukraine’s defense ministry said on Sunday that a new group of Wagner mercenaries had entered the country with the aim of targeting the president and other high-ranking Ukrainian officials. The group’s members have experience fighting in countries including Syria and Libya, where they have been linked to war crimes. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/25/2022,"By Phil Stewart WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States assesses that Russia is suffering failure rates as high as 60% for some of the precision-guided missiles it is using to attack Ukraine, three U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence told Reuters. The disclosure could help explain why Russia has failed to achieve what most could consider basic objectives since its invasion a month ago, such as neutralizing Ukraine's air force, despite the apparent strength of its military against Ukraine's much smaller armed forces. The U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the information, did not provide evidence to support the assessment and did not disclose what precisely was driving high Russian missile failure rates. Reuters was unable to independently verify the figures. The Kremlin and Russia's defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Such a high failure rate can include anything from launch failures to a missile failing to explode on impact. U.S. defense officials told reporters this week that the Pentagon assesses that Russia has launched more than 1,100 missiles of all kinds since the war began. The U.S. officials have so far not said how many of those hit their targets and how many failed to do so. Citing U.S. intelligence, three U.S. officials said the United States estimated that Russia's failure rate varied day-to-day, depended on the type of missile being launched, and could sometimes exceed 50%. Two of them said it reached as high as 60%. One of the officials said the intelligence showed that Russia's air-launched cruise missiles had a failure rate in the 20 to 60% range, depending on the day. Russia has been seen fielding two types of air-launched cruise missiles in Ukraine, the Kh-555 and Kh-101, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank's Missile Defense Project. Reuters could not determine what a standard failure rate would be for air-launched cruise missiles. Two experts interviewed by Reuters said any failure rate of 20% and above would be considered high. The United States believes Russia fired air-launched cruise missiles from Russian airspace earlier this month when it attacked a Ukrainian military base near the Polish border, and one of the U.S. officials told Reuters there was a particularly high failure rate during this attack. The strike killed 35 people, according to Ukrainian authorities. Missile attacks have been a feature of Russia's invasion, with Russia announcing strikes against military targets including weapons depots. The invasion has killed thousands and driven a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes. The bombardment has hit residential areas, schools and hospitals in Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv and the besieged port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. Russia, which says its military is engaged in a ""special operation"" in Ukraine, denies targeting civilians.
