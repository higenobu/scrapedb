3/18/2022,"To MPs in London, he channelled Churchill and Shakespeare. To the US congress, he evoked Pearl Harbor and 9/11. For the Bundestag it was the Berlin Wall; for Canada’s lawmakers, their large Ukrainian community. MEPs in Brussels were reminded of Ukraine’s place in the continent’s family of nations. Each of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s addresses to western legislatures has contained historical references carefully chosen to appeal to the audience; each has been greeted with a standing ovation. If he found domestic fame as an actor and comedian, it is the Ukrainian president’s talent as an orator that has won him foreign acclaim. Speaking by video to German MPs on Wednesday, the 44-year-old leader again displayed his habitual mix of passion, pride and defiance; of brutally vivid portrayals of his people’s suffering; direct, straight-from-the-heart entreaties for more help; and inspiring invocations of common ideals and shared pasts, presents and futures. But it is his references to each country’s history – and suggestion that this could all be happening to them – that have hit hardest. “Dear Mr. Scholz, tear down this wall,” he implored Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, echoing former US president Ronald Reagan’s 1987 plea to his Soviet counterpart Mikhail Gorbachev from a divided Berlin. Russia, Zelenskiy said, was now building “not a Berlin Wall, but a wall in central Europe between freedom and bondage, and this wall is growing bigger with every bomb that lands in Ukraine”. Germany’s own history, he said, meant it owed it to Ukraine’s to back the country’s push to join the EU. Thousands had already died, he said in his address, including 108 children. “And we’re talking about the middle of Europe, in the year 2022,” he said, before adding, in another pointed historical reference: “Once again, attempts are being made to annihilate an entire people.” In a speech to MEPs on 1 March that brought one interpreter close to tears, Zelenskiy said Ukrainians were literally fighting for a European future. “Thousands of people killed, two revolutions, one war and five days of full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation” is a “very high price” to pay for EU membership, he said. “We have proven our strengths,” he said. “We have proven that, at a minimum, we are exactly the same as you are. So do prove that you are with us, do prove that you will not let us go. Do prove that you indeed are Europeans.” Freedom Square in Kharkov, the target of a recent fatal attack, could have been any plaza on the continent, he said. For British MPs in London, Zelenskiy echoed the wartime words of Winston Churchill and invoked the fight against Nazism, telling a packed chamber: “We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests, the fields, the shores and in the streets.” Ukraine “will not lose” to Russia, he vowed. The president also cited Shakespeare to describe his country’s plight. “The question for us now is to be or not to be,” he said. “Oh no, this Shakespearean question. I can give you a definitive answer. It’s definitely yes, to be … Just the same way you once didn’t want to lose your country when the Nazis started to fight you.” He asked Canadian lawmakers on 9 March to imagine the impact of such a war on their own country, demanding directly of the prime minister, Justin Trudeau: “Imagine that [at] 4am … you start hearing bomb explosions. Justin, can you imagine – you and your children hear all these severe explosions?” He reminded Canadians that 1.4 million people of Ukrainian descent live among them, the largest Ukrainian diaspora outside Russia, and days after the TV tower in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, was struck by a missile, asked: “Can you imagine the famous CN Tower in Toronto if it was hit by Russian bombs? This is our reality in which we live.” In a virtual address before both chambers of the US Congress on Wednesday, Zelenskiy also invoked key events in the country’s history, including the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and the 11 September, 2001 terror attacks. “Just like nobody else expected it, you could not stop it,” he said. “Our country experienced the same, right now, at this moment, every night, for three weeks now.” Citing the civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King, he added: “‘l have a dream’ – these words are known to each of you today. I have a need, a need to protect our sky.” According to Ukrainian officials, Zelenskiy’s speechwriters produce a first draft from which he freely departs as he speaks. Some of his appeals, – notably for a no-fly zone, which Nato and the EU will not consider for fear of provoking direct conflict with Russia – may not have produced results. But none have fallen flat.",News/World news,"From Churchill to Pearl Harbor, Zelenskiy’s speeches push the right buttons abroad",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/from-churchill-to-pearl-harbor-volodymyr-zelenskiy-speeches-push-the-right-buttons-abroad
3/18/2022,"The equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, has strongly condemned the strip-searching of a 15-year-old black girl in a London school, but said the public backlash against the incident shows the UK is “a country that cares about ethnic minorities”. The experiences of Child Q were repeatedly raised with Badenoch by MPs, as she presented the government’s strategy for tackling racial disparities in the UK. She called it an “appalling incident”, welcoming the fact the Met has apologised, and that the case is now being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Badenoch added: “What we cannot do is stop any bad thing from happening to anyone in the country at any time. That is a threshold that is impossible to meet. “But what we do know is that everybody is rightly appalled and outraged by what happened to Child Q. That is an example of a country that cares about ethnic minorities and about children in the system, and we will continue to do everything we can to support them.” Labour MP Diane Abbott pressed Badenoch about the case in the House of Commons, giving some of its shocking details. “Is the minister aware of how degrading this strip search was? It wasn’t that she was just stripped naked: they made her part the cheeks of her bottom and cough. She was on her period,” Abbott said. “I could give more detail but I don’t want to distress people in this House.” She added that the girl is “still traumatised”, and no drugs were ever found. “How can the minister sit there and tell this House that it had nothing to do with that young girl’s race?” Abbott added. She pointed out that it was “not an isolated incident”, with the Met’s own data showing that 25 children were strip-searched in 2020-21. Abbott said that almost all of those 25 were from ethnic minorities, with 60% of them black, and just two white. Badenoch conceded those figures were “startling”, adding, “no one has said that racism does not exist,” and every incident should be investigated. However, she insisted that cases such as that of Child Q should not undermine the public’s trust in the police more broadly. “When these things happen, we mustn’t forget that every day the police are saving the lives of young people all across this country. They save the lives of young black children, brown, Asian, of all communities,” she said, adding that it was important not to see such incidents as “representative of every single thing the police do”. Badenoch was launching the government’s Inclusive Britain report – a response to the Sewell review into racial disparities in the UK, published last year. The government has promised to take a range of actions, including developing a model history curriculum to teach children about the UK’s “complex” past; improving grassroots oversight of police stop and search powers; and collecting more fine-grained data on the experiences of different ethnic communities. Sewell’s report was condemned by some activists for playing down the idea of widespread structural racism in the UK. Badenoch said the report had not denied the existence of structural racism, but defended its approach, saying, “We see crime in our country every day, yet we do not say this is an institutionally criminal country. And that is the same way that we look at accusations of racism. It is important to distinguish the two.” She also condemned the treatment of Sewell, who was stripped of an honorary degree by Nottingham University in the wake of the controversy. “What is wrong is when people with different opinions are attacked and told that they’re not allowed to think in a certain way because there are rules about what black people or Asian people are allowed to say,” she said.",News/UK news,"Backlash over strip-searched girl shows UK cares about minorities, says Kemi Badenoch",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/17/backlash-over-strip-searched-girl-child-q-uk-cares-about-minorities-kemi-badenoch
3/18/2022,"At least 20 Conservative MPs lobbied a committee investigating new rules on second jobs and their behaviour in the Commons chamber, with many saying they strongly disagreed with time limits on outside work. The revelation came as the Guardian revealed ministers have argued to ditch plans to cap MPs’ earnings from second jobs, months after Boris Johnson himself suggested the curbs amid a sleaze scandal which provoked widespread Tory rebellion. The pledge to put tighter restrictions on second jobs came amid a public outcry over lobbying breaches by the former MP Owen Paterson, whom MPs were initially whipped to try and protect, and a furore over former attorney general Geoffrey Cox being paid nearly £6m as a lawyer since joining parliament, voting by proxy on days he was undertaking paid work. Two cabinet ministers, Dominic Raab and Anne-Marie Trevelyan, expressly backed a time limit on second jobs last autumn, suggesting it could be 10-15 hours a week. But with pressure off Johnson’s premiership because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, ministers submitted their view to the Commons standards committee that a time limit or ceiling on such earnings would be “impractical”. The Labour leader Keir Starmer said Johnson was breaking his promise to the public to tackle second jobs. “He said he was going to deal with second jobs and there was going to be this cap,” he told reporters. “That was his proposal at the height of this scandal of his own making. Now, as soon as he gets the opportunity, he is breaking his promise yet again. It goes to the heart of the problem with this prime minister, which is this problem of trust and moral authority.” The Guardian can reveal a number of former cabinet ministers have also expressed concern at the proposals by the Commons standards committee to limit outside earnings, paid political consultancy, and also to introduce new principles of respect in the code of conduct and limit abusive language in the Commons. Jeremy Wright, the former attorney general, said that “arbitrary time limits” would not address public concern on potential conflict of interest. “Time spent as a nurse also has the same impact on time available for constituents as time spent as a hedge fund manager,” he wrote. “Again, transparency is the most effective way for constituents to determine whether they find the arrangements of their member of parliament acceptable or not.” The former transport secretary Chris Grayling also raised concerns about banning MPs from acting as political consultants, saying MPs could take on those role without it influencing their activities in the house. “The use of the word ‘political’ is very broad ranging and could draw into the proposed restrictions areas of activity which are unrelated to UK parliamentary activity but which can sometimes have a political dimension,” he wrote, citing the example of “working with an international business on environmental strategies across several countries”. In parliament’s register of members’ financial interest, Grayling declares he earns about £100,000 as a strategic adviser to Hutchinson Ports, dedicating “around seven hours” a week to the role. The skills minister, Alex Burghart, wrote there should be no limit on time. “Members should have to declare how much time they spend on other activities and how much they earn and then it is for their electorate – and no one else – to decide whether they deem that to be acceptable. It would also prove impossible to enforce.” Dan Poulter, the former health minister who works as a doctor, said any limit would involve “policing an MP’s personal life and free time” and said that was “almost impossible to police, and could result in vexatious complaints against members”. One letter, submitted anonymously by an MP, said they did not have enough time to absorb complex rules and that any further change to the rules “creates more witch hunts and fear of which there is already more than enough at Westminster.” The MP also complained that expense declarations were too onerous for MPs and the consequences of mistaken declarations too great. “The baseline assumption as a new MP, seems to be that I am on the scrounge and should be treated like a child and punished at the first opportunity. If we were treated like adults we would be far more likely en masse to act like them.” Another anonymous submission said that that it would be “fruitless or over-complicated” to set limits, saying it was “greatly to the benefit of the house” that members keeps their business and professional knowledge through outside work. “It is irrelevant what level of remuneration they receive provided it is transparently declared … it should be a reassuring sign the are highly valued in their field.” Tory MP Craig Whittaker described the proposed time limits and declaring contracts for second jobs as “more nonsense! Bureaucratic, burdensome and just plain ridiculous” and “another ‘barking mad’ idea!”. Some MPs also said they strongly opposed new curbs on using Commons offices to do their private work. At the height of the second jobs scandal, Cox was revealed to have used his parliamentary office to make calls with external clients.",News/Politics,Tory MPs lobbied committee over ‘impractical’ second jobs rules,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/17/tory-mps-lobbied-committee-over-impractical-second-jobs-rules
3/18/2022,"More than 1,000 police officers and staff accused of domestic abuse are still serving in law enforcement, new figures show. Eight out of 10 kept their jobs after the allegations were made, with a small fraction being disciplined or dismissed. Experts and campaigners said the figures were further evidence of problems in policing, not just in terms of misogyny in the ranks but in a failure of leadership to tackle wrongdoers. A series of freedom of information requests by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism showed that 1,080 out of 1,319 police officers and staff who were reported for alleged domestic abuse during a three-year period were still working. Replies were received from 41 forces across the UK. Just 36 officers and staff, 2.7% of the total reported, were dismissed, while 203 either resigned or retired or left for other reasons. Disciplinary actions, which can include written warnings or suspension, were taken against 120 officers and staff, 9.1% of the total. The conviction rate of police officers and staff for domestic abuse is 3.4%, lower than the 6.3% in the general population. In one case, a male officer with the Metropolitan police was alleged to have abused his partner, a female Met officer. Susie, not her real name, said she was physically and sexually abused by him during their relationship. She reported him to the Met but, despite other claims he was abusing a second female officer, the force decided he could continue working. Susie said: “They say how much they’re going to support women, and they don’t. That’s a really bitter pill to swallow.” Ruth Davison, the chief executive of the charity Refuge, described the figures as alarming: “We see that there is a problem of misogyny, not just in the Met police but right across the police force. The whole of the police force needs radical culture change. “I can’t really overstate how serious this is. Domestic abuse is fundamentally about power and control, the abuse of power. And police officers do have power; they’re supposed to use that for our benefit to uphold the law and to keep us safe.” The replies from forces covered allegations from January 2018 to September 2021. The action taken by forces differed. The Met, the largest force, received 398 domestic abuse reports against serving officers and staff, with nine people being dismissed and 336 still working. The second largest force, Police Scotland, did not dismiss a single employee after receiving 67 reports in three years. The Police Service of Northern Ireland dismissed one employee after receiving 52 reports. The second largest force in England, West Midlands police, kept its records secret, claiming the cost of providing them would be excessive. Concerns mounted over misogyny in the police after a serving Met officer kidnapped and murdered Sarah Everard as she walked home in London in March last year. Last month an official report described officers at Charing Cross police station swapping grossly offensive WhatsApp messages, including about violence to women. The Charing Cross scandal triggered the ousting of Cressida Dick as Met commissioner, with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, angered by the response of the Met leadership. A spokesperson for Khan said of the domestic abuse findings: “These shocking figures are deeply concerning and will be worrying for the public, risking even further damage to trust and confidence in the police.” The shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, Jess Phillips, said: “The police have got to undertake huge reforms to ensure women and girls feel safe and that has to start with them. When cases are brought against police officers, they must act without fear or favour, and act accordingly.” A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs’ Council said: “Figures such as these will cause concern to victims and we want to assure you that policing is working hard to root out those who display misogynistic characteristics.” The murder of Sarah Everard has led to two inquiries, one commissioned by the Met and the other by the home secretary.",News/UK news,"80% of UK police accused of domestic abuse kept jobs, figures show",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/17/80-percent-of-uk-police-accused-of-domestic-abuse-kept-jobs-figures-show
3/18/2022,"Minella Indo and Rachael Blackmore go back a long way at Cheltenham. Three years ago almost to the day, he was her breakthrough Grade One winner, an unconsidered 50-1 shot in what turned out to be one of the strongest novice hurdles of recent years. Allaho and Lisnagar Oscar, in third and fifth, were Grade One winners themselves at future Festivals, and Blackmore too soon moved on to even better things. His Festival form figures are 1-2-1. He loves the track and thrives in the spring. And yet, for the second year running, when Minella Indo goes to post for the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Friday, Blackmore will be doing her utmost to beat him. She failed 12 months ago, finishing one-and-a-quarter lengths behind Minella Indo after deciding to ride his stable companion, A Plus Tard, instead. It was one of those choices that come with the territory for an elite jockey attached to a major stable. Blackmore had ridden Minella Indo in his previous 10 races and A Plus Tard in 10 of his last 11 but still managed to pick the wrong one. At the end of an otherwise triumphant meeting, when her six winners made her the first female to finish the week as leading rider, the biggest prize of all was the one that got away. A seventh success would have equalled Ruby Walsh’s all-time record for a single Festival. It would also have seen her arrive back at Cheltenham this week with a win in all three of the sport’s biggest races – the Gold Cup and Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham and the Grand National at Aintree – already in the bag. As it is, the Festival’s showpiece is unfinished business for Blackmore, who was 29 and a veteran of nine seasons in the saddle when she rode her first Grade One winner in 2019 and has since racked up another 22. Long since just the jockey, rather than the “female jockey”, that she wants to be, Blackmore is now closing in on the achievements that mark out the all-time greats. Even outstanding champions of the past like John Francome, Peter Scudamore and more recently Richard Johnson failed to win all three of jumping’s biggest races. None of her rivals for the top-jockey prize this week has won all three either, which is a measure of how far Blackmore will have travelled, and how rapidly, if she can get A Plus Tard home on Friday. In the circumstances, it seems a little surprising that Blackmore opted for A Plus Tard over Minella Indo several months ago, putting factors like the ground – which has come right for last year’s winner – to one side. But it does suggest that his dominant success in the Betfair Chase in November felt as good in the saddle as it looked from the stands, and also that Blackmore is not unduly concerned by their short-head defeat behind Galvin at Leopardstown’s Christmas meeting. “It was extremely difficult choosing last year as I’d won on both of them in Cheltenham and I’d ridden both of them in most of their races,” Blackmore said on Thursday. “That’s the privileged position I found myself in, choosing between two horses who were both very well fancied for the Gold Cup. I made the wrong call, but that’s part and parcel of being a jockey. “Obviously it was very hard getting beaten by Minella Indo, but I’d made that choice myself and that’s racing. I didn’t think I gave him [A Plus Tard] a fantastic ride at Leopardstown the last day [behind Galvin], I don’t think I got into a great position early on and so I used him up a little early. I’m really looking forward to riding him again and hopefully we can go one better than last year.” It has been a week of contrasts for A Plus Tard’s rider so far, with a second victory on Honeysuckle in Tuesday’s Champion Hurdle followed immediately by a bone-shuddering fall. A blank on Wednesday, then a huge stroke of good fortune to start the day on Thursday, as the last-fence fall of Galopin Des Champs turned a certain second-place finish into a highly unlikely Grade One win on Bib Olinger. And it will all come to the boil on the final afternoon, when National Hunt’s star rider will hope against hope to be right second time. Minella Indo (3.30) is without a win in three starts since last year’s Gold Cup, but he is a big price at around 5-1 to confirm his form with A Plus Tard 12 months ago and become the second dual Gold Cup winner in the last three years. Nothing went right for him in the King George at Christmas but Minella Indo’s run behind Conflated in the Irish Gold Cup hinted at a return to form and he always seems to flourish at Cheltenham in March. The recent rain will bring his stamina into play and while the strong stayer Galvin is a dangerous opponent, his price is too short to beat a proven champion. Cheltenham 1.30 Knight Salute is more exposed than most of his rivals but he has made rapid progress in his five races to date and his latest win in the Adonis at Kempton was another career-best. His current price of around 16-1 is too big for all that rivals like Vauban and Pied Piper have considerable scope for improvement. Cheltenham 2.10 Suprise Package, the easy winner of Saturday’s Imperial Cup, is a reminder that several Irish-trained runners here could be a long way in front of their mark, but I Like To Move It is arguably the form horse on his close second in the Betfair Hurdle and has a solid each-way chance at around 12-1. Cheltenham 2.50 A race that often throws up a surprise – the last eight favourites have all been beaten – and Bardenstown Lad, a course-and-distance winner in October, may have crept in under the radar at around 20-1.

That was his first run for 268 days, however, and a subsequent easy win at Naas suggests this could finally be his year. Cheltenham 4.50 This could well end up as a head-to-head between Elimay, last year’s runner-up, and Mount Ida, and while the latter gave weight and a half-length beating to Elimay in January, this left-handed track seems more likely to suit Willie Mullins’s mare. Cheltenham 5.30 The Martin Pipe has is no place to be seeking salvation at the end of Festival week, but Hes A Hardy Bloke is suggested as one who could go well at a big price. He is completely unexposed at this trip and ran as if it might be within reach when eighth in a big field at Leopardstown in February.

3/18/2022,"Tall, commanding, deep-voiced and usually moustached, Peter Bowles, who has died at the age of 85, was frequently cast as either establishment chaps or gangster geezers. His most successful roles in the former camp were as Richard DeVere in To the Manor Born (1979-81), one of Britain’s most-watched sitcoms, and The Irish RM from 1983-85, playing Maj Yeates, a British Army officer sent to 19th-century UK-ruled Ireland as a “resident magistrate”. The standout villain roles in a very distinguished theatre CV were Vic Parks – a bank robber turned media celebrity – in Alan Ayckbourn’s 1990 West End hit Man of the Moment, and an East End villain in Louis Mellis and David Scinto’s Gangster No 1 at the Almeida in 1995. Bowles also had the class, in acting terms, to interestingly explore the overlaps between the two social groups, combining both sides of the range as an upper-class conman in The Bounder, another TV success which was shown on ITV in 1982 and 83. Across a 66-year career, he spectacularly disproved the warning of a drama school teacher that his dark hair and rapidly tanning skin meant he “would never play an Englishman”. Not completely English, though, was the pivotal role in his career: DeVere. Very many English comedies have turned on social differences, but the twist in Peter Spence’s To the Manor Born was that both main characters looked and sounded like the landed gentry. Penelope Keith’s Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, though, considered herself a real lady, while regarding DeVere, who outbid Audrey for her late husband’s country estate at auction, as a false gentleman, exposing him as the child of Czech-Polish émigré parents, his name anglicised to help his supermarket business. Like another comedy from the same era, Only Fools and Horses, the show was a reflection of the disruptions to the English class system by the recently elected Margaret Thatcher, a shopkeeper’s daughter who had poshed up her voice but was committed to social mobility. The casting of the charming Bowles helped to offset the potentially nasty snobbery of the premise; it seemed inevitable from the start that Audrey would fall for Richard despite his nouveau roots, and the couple eventually married. The estate setting and anti-arriviste stance are so specifically English that To the Manor Born is one of the few mega-hit sitcoms not to have been adapted abroad, but it did exceptionally well in the UK: one 1979 episode had an audience of 23.5 million, a figure otherwise in reach only of cup finals, royal weddings or funerals, and Morecambe & Wise Christmas shows. It’s true that the huge viewership was boosted by ITV running a makeshift repeat-filled schedule as it emerged from a long strike, but a less charismatically acted show could have been exposed by the brightened spotlight. To the Manor Born had been commissioned as another vehicle for the high snobbery that had made Keith famous as Margo in The Good Life on the BBC (1975-78). Ironically, Bowles had turned down the part of Jerry, Margo’s husband, which made a star of Paul Eddington. Some actors who reject a hit never get a second chance, but To the Manor Born meant Bowles achieved national recognisability just a few years later. However, in making his career, DeVere almost capsized it. Alarmed when a BBC producer predicted he would never act in drama again now that he was classified as a sitcom performer, he came up with the idea for ITV’s Lytton’s Diary (1983-86), wittily scripted by Ray Connolly, with Bowles playing a suave newspaper gossip columnist somewhat based on Nigel Dempster of the Daily Mail. That led to the offer of The Irish RM and Bowles subsequently alternated drama and comedy on TV and stage. With his income from TV, Bowles bought the film rights to Gangster No 1 when he accepted the part on stage, although it was not enough to allow him to reprise the role in the 2000 movie version (the role went to Malcolm McDowell). Bowles’s career benefited from the friendships between three men of theatre: Sir Peter Hall, Harold Pinter and Simon Gray. Gray’s TV film Running Late (1992), with Bowles as an egotistical TV talkshow host whose life unravels during a London day, was so admired by Hall that he cast the actor in a sequence of eight revivals from 1993, including Terence Rattigan’s Separate Tables, Noël Coward’s Hay Fever (with Judi Dench) and, in 2011, Sheridan’s The Rivals, opposite Penelope Keith, with whom he had also reunited in a 2007 one-off special episode of To the Manor Born. Gray, who had started that wave of fine late-career work with Running Late, gave Bowles his last great stage role, as art dealer Joseph Duveen in The Old Masters (2004), directed by Harold Pinter. Edward Fox co-starred as the art critic Bernard Berenson. Shortly afterwards, I met Pinter at an event and complimented him on the production. He deflected the compliment on to Fox and Bowles: “Definitely old masters, those two.” From one of theatre’s most meticulous directors, the remark emphasised how much was missed by those who knew Peter Bowles only as a sitcom star.",Arts/Television & radio,Peter Bowles: a commanding talent who was so much  more than a sitcom star,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/17/peter-bowles-a-commanding-talent-who-was-so-much-more-than-a-sitcom-star
3/18/2022,"Furious P&O Ferries customers have rounded on the company for leaving them stranded at short notice and for its “abysmal” treatment of 800 staff, whose abrupt sacking on Thursday morning triggered chaos at ports across the country. P&O initially told passengers that services were unable to run “for the next few hours”, affecting the Dover-Calais crossing and the routes from Hull to Rotterdam, Liverpool to Dublin and Cairnryan in Scotland to Larne. But as furious workers responded to their dismissal by staging sit-ins on board P&O boats, the company announced that many services would not run “for the next few days”. Peter Theakston, 53, had been visiting his ill mother in Yorkshire and was due to return to The Hague, the Netherlands, at 8pm on Thursday night, on a £200 foot passenger ticket. He said the company had not been in touch to explain what was happening or offer any advice and was not picking up the phone. “I’m pissed off,” he told the Guardian on Thursday afternoon. “There’s no news at all about the sailings. They’re updating everything else but not Hull-Rotterdam and they’re still taking bookings even though they say they’re not sailing. Theakston, who has been using the Hull-Rotterdam overnight service for 20 years, said he had been unable to reach the company. P&O, which has no competition on the route, said later on Twitter that the service had been cancelled. Theakston added that the company’s decision to sack 800 staff out of the blue, via a video message, was “totally obscene”. “It makes you ashamed to be British that the government lets the company do this,” he said. The official P&O Ferries Twitter account told passengers on Thursday that it was trying to arrange alternative passage for them with rival ferry companies such as DFDS and Stena. “Where possible we are organising travel via an alternative operator,” it said. “Space is very limited so we would suggest if your journey is not essential, please do not travel today. We apologise for any inconvenience.” But some passengers reported difficulty in transferring their tickets. One said that the company had told her that her booking would be valid on a boat operated by rival Stena but that Stena had told her to rebook. “What are we supposed to do about the refund?” she asked. P&O said in a Twitter response that she would receive a full refund. A second Twitter user said Stena “know nothing and are not honouring the bookings”. A third said his son was due to sail from Dover to Calais at the start of a school trip to Austria.

3/18/2022,"Children from middle class backgrounds are being lured into extreme rightwing terrorism with online content based on violent video games shaped to indoctrinate them, Britain’s most senior counter-terrorism officer has said. Assistant commissioner Matt Jukes said that 19 out of 20 children aged under 18 who were arrested last year for terrorism offences were linked to an extreme rightwing ideology. Those falling for rightwing hate and then breaking terror laws were younger than those falling for Islamist hate, according to Jukes, the Met police’s head of counter-terrorism. Jukes said: “One thing we see is young people who do not understand that researching and then sharing some of the material which they encounter, is a terrorist offence…[and] will lead them to serious consequences.” Most counter-terrorism activity in the United Kingdom continues to be tackling the threat of Islamist-inspired violence but the extreme right continues to grow. Jukes said 41% of counter-terrorism arrests in 2021 were of extreme rightwing suspects, and three out of four advanced plots disrupted by police involved rightwing extremists. He was speaking to mark the fifth anniversary of the string of terrorist attacks in 2017, one of which was extreme rightwing while the rest were Islamist. Counter-terrorism police and MI5, the security services, are bracing themselves for potential criticism following the inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing, which is expected this year to publish conclusions having heard evidence of alleged failings. Jukes said the make-up of those drawn to the extreme rightwing was from families with a stake in society: “Actually they are in some cases, relatively well educated …. If you were imagining this was necessarily all aligned to disenfranchised, poorer, disengaged, white communities, actually the evidence is that is a much more complex picture than that, and that we see people whose background might be relatively middle class, relatively well educated.” While once terror cells and big plots were the threat, now it is more likely to be young people being turned by online propaganda in their bedrooms. The extreme right was adept at this and exploited an interest in gaming, said Juke. “Some of the videos produced by the extreme rightwing groups pick up the tropes of the presentation of first-person shooter games,” he added. “They are presenting something which is very attractive, potentially to a vulnerable, young person, a young boy who spends a lot of time gaming.” He said: “There is a picture here of young people spending a great deal of time discussing and sharing material online. We are absolutely seeing some of that shift to carrying out terrorist attacks.” Rightwing hate material was targeting Jews, Muslims and women as well as spreading conspiracies and lies of a plot to replace white men, said Jukes The youngest suspect arrested was 13, and a 15-year-old boy was charged last week over terrorist material to do with bomb-making, alleged to have been shared online. Amid confused messaging from the government about Britons going to fight in the Ukraine war, Jukes issued a warning. Privately some counter-terrorism officials believe there is little they can do, especially given that the UK government is backing the Ukrainian government. Jukes said: “People would face a range of risks, including legal, and therefore we would absolutely encourage people of finding other ways of supporting the Ukrainian people. We would have to consider any travel on a case-by-case basis.”",News/UK news,Far right ‘mimicking video games to lure middle class children to terrorism’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/17/far-right-mimicking-video-games-to-lure-middle-class-children-to-terrorism
3/18/2022,"One of the first three people to face a criminal case under Russia’s “fake news” law has said the charges mean she has been “officially declared a decent person”. “To find out I was the first one to be charged was both amusing and shocking. I joked that I was officially declared a decent person,” said Veronika Belotserkovskaya, a popular food entrepreneur and blogger with almost 1 million Instagram followers who was one of the three Russians charged under the new law that carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. The moves marked an escalation in the country’s crackdown on anti-war dissent. The investigative committee said the case was opened against Belotserkovskaya over posts published on her Instagram page that “contained knowingly false information about the use of the Russian armed forces”. Belotserkovskaya, who has fiercely criticized Russia’s action in Ukraine, said the specific charges against her could land her in jail for 10 years. “I am exactly the type of person Putin had in mind when he launched his speech last night. He wants to frame people like me as traitors, the fifth column,” Belotserkovskaya told the Guardian, speaking from her house in the south of France where she settled during the pandemic and where she now runs an upscale cooking school. “I live a good life, post pretty pictures online about food. They now want to portray me as the face of the ‘decadent west’.” Belotserkovskaya was referring to the speech the Russian president made on Wednesday in which he called for a “necessary self-purification of society”, aimed at western-minded Russians who weren’t “mentally” with the nation. Putin said: “The Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and simply spit them out like a fly that accidentally flew into their mouth. “I am convinced that such a natural and necessary self-purification of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity, cohesion and readiness to respond to any challenges,” Putin said adding that certain Russians “cannot live without oysters and gender freedoms”. “I am a sensible person, I am definitely not planning on returning to Russia as long as these charges are there,” Belotserkovskaya said. She says it was telling that the authorities didn’t charge a journalist or a politician under the new law, but a food and lifestyle blogger. “They are aiming to punish a much broader swath of society,” she said. In the aftermath of Putin’s speech, analysts voiced similar concerns that the Russian leader was laying the grounds for a new, even fiercer crackdown at home. “The Kremlin has de-facto brought back the Soviet term of ‘enemy of the state’ by referring to Russian people as ‘national traitors’,” said Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment. “We are entering a new phase of a process that has been going on for a while. The goal is to discredit everyone who voices his opposition against Putin,” Kolesnikov said. Belotserkovskaya, 51, born in Odessa, is a well-known figure in Moscow high society, counting many socialites as her friends, including Ksenia Sobchak, the daughter of Putin’s political mentor Anatoly Sobchak. She had been a vocal opponent of the war ever since Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, accusing the Russian leader of turning Russian “boys aged 18 to 20 into the mincemeat of his imperial ambitions”. “I am not a political person, I am speaking out as a mother of three sons. Ukrainian children are dying, it is not possible to stay quiet,” Belotserkovskaya said, admitting that she felt safe speaking out from abroad. “Many of my friends in Russia agree with me but are scared to say anything. I completely understand that,” she said. The charge against Belotserkovskaya now points to the Kremlin’s willingness to go after Russia’s social, business and cultural elites that voice even the slightest opposition against the country’s war efforts. One wealthy Russian businessperson who resided in London but frequently travelled to Moscow said: “I don’t really feel safe returning to Russia after the speech.” “The signals were as clear as they get.” But it is not just the western-minded affluent Russians that could fall victim to a new wave of repression. In stark contrast to the high profile Belotserkovskaya, the other two Russians charged on Wednesday under the new law were residents of the Siberian region of Tomsk. One of them, Marina Novikova, a 63-year-old pensioner from a small industrial town outside Tomsk, was charged with “disinformation” against the military for criticizing Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Her posts were published on her personal Telegram channel which counted only 170 subscribers at the time. The third person has not been named yet. Kolesnikov argues that the seemingly random application of the new law serves a very specific purpose – to create an atmosphere of fear in society. “The message from the Kremlin is simple: ‘Be afraid, anyone can be next’,” he said. “We will be seeing more of these charges soon. They are just getting started.”",News/World news,‘It is not possible to stay quiet’: Putin’s first victim of ‘fake news’ law speaks out,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/veronika-belotserkovskaya-putin-fake-news-law-first-victim-russia-ukraine
3/18/2022,"Joy at the release of two Britons from an Iranian jail should not conceal the squalid diplomacy revealed by their ordeal. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori have been victims of the latest weapon of western coercion, on display in all its impotence. The essence of the case isn’t disputed. Britain owed Iran £400m for undelivered military equipment. Britain found the Tehran regime distasteful. It also said it should not be allowed to build nuclear plants. With America and others, it signalled this distaste with what was, after the 1979 Iranian revolution, a relatively novel form of aggression: a comprehensive trade embargo. The Iranians retaliated with an equally medieval weapon: the taking of hostages. There followed a saga of diplomatic duplicity, intransigence and incompetence on all sides. When the Shah of Iran had fallen it was at least conceivable that the country might mature, like Pakistan, into a semi-democratic state and friend of the west. As it was, America and Britain could not resist a post-imperial urge to order its behaviour. Each failure of “human rights” – or each regional interference – was punished with harsher sanctions. The ayatollahs and their military Revolutionary Guards grew stronger with each barrage of abusive epithets hurled by western diplomats. Sanctions and ostracism exiled Iran’s mercantile and intellectual class – seedbed of potential opposition – while impoverishing the mass of the Iranian people. They were utterly counterproductive, leaving Iran today with its most extremist government for decades. Apart from a brief relaxation in the 1980s, Iran has been under economic and cultural siege for almost half a century, thus preserved as a citadel of Islamist fundamentalism, constantly destabilising the region. There is virtually no academic study of what has become the most ubiquitous – and fashionable – weapon of international conflict, the sanction. America has around three dozen countries subject to some embargo or other. Conferences I have attended on the subject debate the deployment of sanctions entirely in terms of hurt inflicted, never objectives won. The present “war on the oligarchs” is a classic of the genre, like high-profile politicians and knights in armour tilting at each other. Sanctions drive their victims into protective shells. The result is glaring. Almost every state sanctioned by the west has been blessed with suppressed dissent and an entrenched power structure. If I were ruler of sanctioned Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Russia, Venezuela, Zimbabwe or Myanmar, I would plead for sanctions to remain. As for sanctioned Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, after the failure of sanctions all became victims of subsequent western military intervention, mostly disastrous. The few critics who have attempted to analyse the impact of these sieges have searched in vain for any sense in them. The historian Richard Haass was intrigued by their “paradoxical” popularity. He found “the economic, humanitarian and foreign policy cost of US sanctions far outweigh any benefits”. They served as “little more than expressions of US preferences … without changing the target’s behaviour for the better”. The philosopher Noam Chomsky has long campaigned against their cruelty and counter-productivity, while the economist Daniel Griswold calculated they were costing America up to $2bn a year, while merely hurting “the poor and most vulnerable in the target countries”. As for the crisis in Ukraine, the sanctions monitors at the American Peterson Institute for International Economics can find no sign that the severest economic aggression in modern history has yielded “the slightest evidence that Moscow will change course and ‘rehabilitate’ itself in the eyes of the west”. The best hope is apparently that China might be deterred from invading Taiwan. The glib reply of proponents of sanctions is that they are better than war. In other words, it is taken as read that the west has an obligation to “do something” about evil regimes wherever they exist. The weapon appeals to democratic politicians as seeming tough without being violent. It offers a quick headline with no need for subsequent validation. Hence the daily cry down the Westminster corridor, from left and right, for “ever tougher sanctions”, like Great War generals demanding that ever more troops must “go over the top”. The experience of Zaghari-Ratcliffe might at least show that while sanctions may not achieve their objective, they do exact a human price. They block the restoration of relations between disagreeing states. They deny the liberalising effect of trade and of intellectual and humanitarian exchange. Soft power is denied its potency. Worse, by being so vacuous, sanctions become almost impossible to withdraw. A British minister, James Cleverly, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that sanctions would continue until the Iranians “change their behaviour”. It might have been Lord Curzon speaking. Unless wonders happen, Ukraine should expose the hypocrisy of the “age of sanctions”. It has Britain traipsing round the Middle East begging for cheaper fuel, so it can pretend it is saving the planet by not drilling its own. It has had to negotiate with one regime, Iran, that it purports to detest, while pleading with another, Saudi Arabia, that it refuses to detest. All because of sanctions.

3/18/2022,"Back in early October the sun was shining at Goodison Park. Everton had won four and drawn two of their first seven league matches of the season and the locals were starting to clasp Rafa Benítez to their true-blue bosoms. Newcastle United, by contrast, had a collective pain in the hole. But how things change: Everton are on the sort of run that could get horses shot, two wins in 19 league matches leaving them at risk of being relegated for the first time since Britain first heard of the Goon Show. Meanwhile, Newcastle are flying high and the only place they need to think about going down to now is the pub. Eddie Howe’s team are flush with confidence and nine points above the team managed at the minute by Frank Lampard. It’s amazing what being taken over by a group entirely separate from one of the world’s richest and most bloodthirsty governments can do. But of course, that tells only half the story because Everton are the living, floundering proof that having lots of money is no guarantee of success. Look at the state of them. Everton were four points above the relegation zone when they hired their latest manager in January, now they are above it on goal difference only. That’s the Super Frank Bounce for you.

3/18/2022,"Bundaberg mayor and former Queensland LNP minister Jack Dempsey has described the Morrison government as being “obsessed by coal” and out of step with almost everybody on the climate crisis “except the big polluters”. Dempsey also alleged federal resources minister and member for Hinkler, Keith Pitt, who has strongly advocated for the coal industry, was out of step with his electorate, which stretches from Hervey Bay to Bundaberg – an area he called the “heartland of Queensland”. “It’s a false stereotype that all regional Queenslanders are coal-loving climate-change deniers,” Dempsey said. “The minister for coal – Keith Pitt – he doesn’t actually reflect the views of our community on environmental issues.” “We’re about clean, green, quality products.” Asked to comment on Dempsey’s claim that he was out of step with his electorate’s views on coal and climate, Pitt said the Bundaberg mayor should confirm whether or not he was running in this year’s federal election. “If Mr Dempsey wants to end the guessing games and confirm his candidacy for the coming federal election to run on these issues then he should be up front with the ratepayers of Bundaberg immediately,” the minister said in a statement. The comments came after Dempsey told a natural resource management forum on Tuesday that Australia was increasingly isolated on the world stage when it came to fossil fuels and emission reductions. On Thursday, he said voters in his electorate did not want to see new coalmines and advocated for 2030 and 2040 interim emissions targets, towards net zero by 2050. “We oppose coal,” Dempsey said. “Our future is in agriculture, it’s in education, it’s in health, it’s in manufacturing – and all of those things rely on the reputation of the area.” A YouGov poll commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation before widespread flooding across the state – but released on Wednesday – found 57% of voters in Hinkler believed climate action would produce long-term economic benefits, compared to 27% who thought it would harm the economy. The poll found 54% of regional Queenslanders were not convinced the prime minister’s commitment to net zero by 2050 was enough action. Pitt has been a vocal advocate of the coal industry, previously saying Australia would mine the fossil fuel for as long as the world wanted to buy it, and has strongly backed the Carmichael and New Acland coalmines. His seat of Hinkler encompasses 3,818 sq km, extending inland to include the towns of Childers and Monto. The seat was retained by Pitt in 2019, with a swing of more than 6% to a comfortable 64.5% of the two-party preferred vote. Dempsey said the Coalition had argued “very effectively” against curtailing fossil fuel extraction at the last election but that “a lot of people have wised up” since then. “Mr Coal wants to go and say, ‘life is gonna finish if we don’t have these fossil products coming in’,” he said. “Every other industry – banking, construction, everyone else – is moving with the times, they understand that there is a transitional change and they see the jobs being created in innovation and technology,” he said. “They want a future for their kids.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The former LNP stalwart said the Morrison government was also failing on disaster mitigation and that Bundaberg had narrowly avoided being “wiped out” again after it dodged the state’s recent “rain bomb”. Dempsey said the commonwealth had “knocked back” funding the East Bundaberg flood levee, despite the Queensland government putting it forward last year as its top priority disaster mitigation project. Asked whether he intended to run for Hinkler, Dempsey said he did not respond to rumours. “They said this at the last election,” he said. “They’ve had me running for Flynn, they’ve had me running for the Senate, they’ve had me running for different bloody political persuasions.” “I just think they need to concentrate on doing a good job to get infrastructure and jobs into our area.” Dempsey said he dropped his LNP membership after entering local politics in 2016.

3/18/2022,"Owners of several hospitality venues in Melbourne have backed the Victorian government’s $246m trial of paid sick leave for casuals, after taking it upon themselves to provide similar benefits to their workers. Under the new scheme announced on Monday by the premier, Daniel Andrews, eligible casual and contract workers will receive up to five days a year of sick or carer’s pay at the national minimum wage, or about $772.60 a week. The announcement was met with swift criticism by business and industry groups, who described it as a “handbrake” on the state’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. The state opposition also indicated they could scrap the trial if elected in November. Huw Murdoch, who owns Wild Life Bakery in Brunswick, said he has been providing paid sick leave to his casual staff since July 2020, when Victoria was in the grips of its second wave of Covid-19. “It’s the morally right thing to do, to encourage staff to feel like they have that ability to take a day off every now and again,” he said. “It actually makes sense from a business perspective. If I can stop someone coming in and giving six other people the illness that they have, that’s going to save me money.” Murdoch has given his employees sick leave for any illness, and allows for five days a year, pro-rated, based on hours worked. He said there hasn’t been a huge number of staff taking the leave, and rejected claims by other business owners that the government trial will be abused by workers. “I get so angry about this mentality that bosses and business owners have that is so cynical and so distrusting of their staff. They just don’t deserve to have them,” Murdoch said. “A business that has that kind of relationship with their staff, that they think that their staff are going to somehow scam them out of a day or two of labour – I don’t have non-sweary ways of expressing my distaste for those sorts of people.” Murdoch said the hospitality industry has a reputation for underpaying superannuation, wage theft and exploiting international workers. “The cafes and restaurants complaining about this kind of thing, they’re also the businesses that are putting up posts or talking to the news about how it’s impossible to find staff,” he said. “Maybe they need to take a bit of a harder look at themselves, because I haven’t had any difficulty finding staff during the whole past two years. I’ve kept most of my staff.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Angie Giannakodakis, co-owner of Epocha, a European restaurant in Carlton where the government announced the trial, also said she paid casual staff who needed to stay home during the pandemic. “We don’t have a lot of staff here, but they are part of our family,” she said. Giannakodakis said she understood concerns within the hospitality industry about the future of the scheme, given the government has said any ongoing scheme would be funded by an industry levy. But she said she felt it was important to make the hospitality industry somewhere people want to work. “Let’s try to fix the problems in this industry, let’s find solutions and find a way to make it a vibrant industry that people want to be a part of rather than dismiss it right away,” Giannakodakis said. However CEO of the Reddrop Group, Lincoln Wymer, which operates 20 supermarkets across Victoria and New South Wales and employs about 1000 people, said the trial was not needed at this point in the pandemic. Wymer said some of its casual staff were paid to stay at home during 2020 and 2021. “The last thing we wanted was someone to say, ‘Well, I’ve got to sneak in and work because I need the money,’ and all of a sudden the supermarket is shut and everyone’s not working,” he said. He said trial might have been suitable early in the pandemic. “It might have been a good short term thing for them to introduce in 2020 or 2021. But Covid-19 is not the beast that it was 18 or even eight months ago,” he said. “We’re all double or triple jabbed now, we’re at the MCG in our thousands, hugging and kissing after every goal.” Wymer said he wants to hire more part-time and full-time staff but has found many younger people, including students and backpackers, enjoyed the freedom of being casual and able to take days off for special occasions or to travel. He also noted casuals already received a 25% loading in lieu of paid sick leave and carer’s leave. “We’re trying to get people in the industry. We have to look after them as much as we can.”",News/Australia news,Business owners who pay sick leave to casuals rally behind Victorian trial ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/18/business-owners-who-pay-sick-leave-to-casuals-rally-behind-victorian-trial
3/18/2022,"Lydia is tired and overwhelmed. She spends growing hours playing a botanist in a video game, avoiding her silent teenage son, George. There’s an ambient weariness in their city, Fraser (a fictional melding of Melbourne and Geelong). People are uneasy, stressed, hysterical – but mainly tired, and starting to tune out. “It’s just – everything,” George says. “The world, the debt, the wars, the extinctions, the oceans. You know?” Fraser has started changing in a very literal way, too. Taxis that were always yellow are suddenly blue; houses and entire suburbs teleport to new locations; freeways change direction. Then Lydia’s estranged sister Alice turns up: warm, spiky and fleeing the criminal consequences of a Banksy-style art prank in Europe. This is the scene of Hovering: a form-shifting debut novel that won Geelong writer Rhett Davis the 2020 Victorian Premier’s literary awards prize for an unpublished manuscript. That he wrote this kind-of-dystopic, not-so-distant future before Covid (part of his PhD, after publishing several short stories) gets weirder as you go. As the consequences of whatever it is Alice has done close in, the city’s erratic movements escalate. A shock jock blames shifting streets on “decaying moral standards”, memeable moments drown out the news, conspiracy theories bloom. Lydia doomscrolls her “streams”, “encountering confused people like her, scrolling, talking, typing, occasionally singing, looking for explanations”. Like Don DeLillo’s White Noise, but with smartphones – overwhelmed civilians confronted by a much more overwhelming environmental event, drawn to the public square. The public square in Hovering is the internet, where, despite an information overload, explanations are not forthcoming. The plot ramps up. The general cloud of buzzing – “milling”, in current parlance – breaks into George’s head, in the form of “indecipherable”, “unbearable” scraps of dialogue and sound he can’t stop hearing. Davis brings this fractured world to the page in an array of formats: emails; instant group chats seasoned with emojis, videos, gifs; tracked phone records; fictional articles, reports and reviews; simultaneous social “streams” (that sync up just once, to powerful effect). This sometimes-chaotic bricolage is counterbalanced by Davis’s language: direct and unadorned, deadpan with bursts of (familial) sincerity in the mould of Jennifer Egan or AM Homes. Like both, he can be funny, and pulls off not writing down to his teenage characters. Hovering doesn’t hit as formally gimmicky in the way recent “internet novels” have (Lauren Oyler’s Fake Accounts, say, or Calvin Kasulke’s more speculative Several People Are Typing). What could feel fragmented reads smoothly: a not-unstandard day/state of consciousness for someone who spends any substantial amount of time online. What is more jarring is the effect of the novel’s timing – how menacing and incongruous the constant feed of government alerts might have seemed pre-pandemic; how frightening and unbelievable the sudden relocation of houses, before rising sea levels swept entire homes off cliffs, and a parade of “unprecedented extreme weather events” in Australia tore up roads, sent cranes down rivers and lined streets with piles of furniture. If this is speculative fiction, it’s very normal-feeling. “How could anyone live in a world like this, where everything moved so fast?” Davis has a character ask. It’s the sort of too-obvious signposting that, though infrequent, is one of the weaker points of this slick debut. But a pertinent question, in fiction and outside it; as someone tweeted (and deleted) recently: “Some real ‘widening gyre vibes’ out there this month.” And so Lydia dissociates, Alice runs away, the sisters’ father, nicely drawn on the novel’s fringe, describes himself as “hovering”, something not too far from “languishing”. George (a genius, we suspect) seeks stillness in his own online life, designing lifelike plants for other games and, privately, endless and intricate digital cities where the streets don’t flip around. The sharp melancholia in a character creating extraordinary new worlds as their current one collapses and burns shouldn’t be lost on anyone. Another soothing thing about virtual worlds is that they are less obviously carved out at someone else’s expense. Alice experiences a profound shift, from her youthful hatred of Fraser for having “no culture that was hers to claim” to the realisation its landscape is “in her bones, her blood” (and clearly Davis’s). But she also knows she’s one among “millions of colonisers … mourning what they’d lost but not what they’d done”. Davis seems to resolve this tension by concluding that Fraser is “an uncertain city, and to live there would be to live with its uncertainty”. This is possibly too neat. For a book so much about the impossibility of resolution, Hovering is very interested in tying up loose ends. Davis offers, if not answers, at least coping strategies: nature can anchor us, family can love us, actions matter. If wholeness of any kind is a delusion, just think of all the parts – cities, the internet, multitudes of suffering others – as “streaks of light and noise and love”. These are tender, hopeful ideas, but they feel tidily sentimental in the face of the wild events and unsettling strength of this novel, which is most interesting when its questions go unanswered: maybe we’ll lose all our data, and then what? And, to get back to Lydia, is there any good way to deal with systemic crisis when you’re tired?

3/18/2022,"The Bureau of Meteorology now says the La Niña event in the Pacific will not break down until late autumn, or almost two months later than originally forecast. And there is a chance that another La Niña will emerge by next summer. That’s not the kind of outlook flood-hit or rain-soaked regions of eastern Australia want to hear. So, what’s going on with this La Niña and when will the rainy weather finally end? The swings between La Niñas and El Niños in the Pacific, with neutral spells in between, are the biggest drivers of short-term global climate variability. During the La Niña phase – which we’re in now – there’s a cooling of the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. The normal easterly blowing winds along the equator are stronger than usual, pushing rainfall patterns into eastern and northern Australia (and away from California). The latest model runs used by the Bureau of Meteorology point to La Niña lasting through May, and possibly into winter. Andrew Watkins, the head of the bureau’s long-range prediction services, says the original forecasts were for the La Niña to start breaking down in the late summer and be gone by early to mid-autumn. “Now we’re saying late autumn,” Watkins says. “It certainly has had an injection of life over the last couple of weeks from those stronger trade winds.” The Pacific is not the only influence on the weather for an inland continent like Australia. An extended La Niña, though, does tilt the odds in favour of above-average rainfall for eastern and northern parts of the country. The bureau’s latest outlook, updated on Thursday, reveals there is an increased chance of unusually high rainfall for the April-June period – in the top 20% of historical records, no less – across the northern tropics and most of the rest of Queensland, and small areas of western and coastal New South Wales. In fact, 1.5 to 3.5 times the usual chance. Now many of those areas do not typically get a lot of rain during this time of year so it may not take a lot to be above normal. Still, as Watkins says, for areas that are sodden or have lately been flooded, above-average rain could be bad news. “Even if the rainfall might not be as extreme as what we’ve seen more recently, the landscape is now very wet, the rivers high, and the dams full,” he says. “So even relatively small amounts of rain are something to be cautious of.” The big floods from late February and early March in south-eastern Queensland and coastal NSW left a damage bill in the billions. Insured claims have already reached $2.22bn as of Thursday, and counting, the Insurance Council of Australia says. La Niña periods also tend to have more cyclones than in neutral years, so an extended phase might see a bit more tropical storm activity before the season is done. This summer’s La Niña was the second in a row, and both have combined to break the severe and prolonged drought over most of eastern Australia. And so, we should see the back of it soon, and look forward to drier times, at least where it has been wet. (Western Australia and western Tasmania wouldn’t mind some of the rain sent their way.) Or could we get three La Niñas in a row? Watkins notes we have had La Niñas in three consecutive years before, such as in 1954-57 (with some very big floods in the Murray River), 1973-76 (some very muddy football seasons) and 1998-2001. “At the moment it doesn’t look like there’s a strong chance of there being a triple La Niña event,” Watkins says. “But you can’t rule it out.” Ruling it in or out just now is actually not so easy. As it happens, we are coming to the so-called “autumn predictability gap” (or spring gap, if you’re based in the northern hemisphere). It’s the time of the year when the Pacific and other regions enter a reset mode with temperature differences across the ocean basins relatively small. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Basically it means that there’s not a strong push one way or another,” Watkins says. “Small influences have the greatest effect at that time of year because the [sea-surface temperature] gradient isn’t particularly strong.” Most models the are not pointing to a triple-header La Niña, although one US model does. The probability of a La Niña reforming after the current one breaks down ranges between 44% to 47% during the second half of the year, according to the Climate Prediction Center/International Research Institute model. The Pacific does call many of the weather shots, at least for eastern and northern Australia from spring into summer. But it is not the only influence and sometimes it is also not the dominant one. The Southern Ocean, for instance, influences how far north or south storm tracks move. A positive phase of the so-called Southern Annular Mode, as we have seen during much of the past summer, means drier conditions in southern Australia. Tasmania’s summer was the driest since 1980-81.

The bureau stresses the five models it uses to predict changes in the Indian Ocean Dipole – which tracks the temperature gradient across the tropical regions – have low accuracy beyond autumn. For the limited skill they have, though, the models currently indicate the IOD will be in its negative phase by next winter. Should that transpire, we might well see above-average rainfall patterns extending well into 2022.

3/18/2022,"The last time South Australians went to the polls to vote in a new government, the state had become a battlefield in a bitter national debate on the climate crisis. A violent storm in 2016 had whipped up two tornadoes – unheard of in that part of the world – and sent them barrelling down the centre of the continent, ripping through transmission lines and plunging the state into darkness. In the aftermath South Australians became collateral damage in a national culture war over the climate crisis, renewable energy and how best to respond to an increasingly volatile environment. Federal politicians seized on the statewide blackout to claim renewable energy was unstable and unreliable, while billionaires Elon Musk and Mike Cannon-Brookes famously arranged a bet over social media about the direction of the state’s power grid. Against this backdrop, the need to transition to a zero carbon economy sparked fierce competition between the two major parties at the 2018 election – a sclerotic Labor administration that had been in power for 16 years and a Liberal opposition sensing blood. Four years later, as South Australians go back to the polling booth this Saturday, the major parties have been relatively quiet on the climate crisis and environmental issues. With the power grid stabilised and the proportion of the state’s energy needs provided by renewables growing from zero to 60% in 14 years, it is no longer the contentious issue it once was. Residents of Kangaroo Island and the Adelaide Hills are yet to fully recover from the Black Summer Bushfires and headlines from the catastrophic floods in New South Wales and Queensland have dominated during the campaign, but the climate crisis has largely taken a back seat as debate focuses on a crisis in the health system. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Patrick O’Connor, the president of the Nature Conservation Society, says this should be a concern to voters as the time available to act is shrinking, with scientists warning deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are needed by 2030. “The next government will finish its term halfway through that decade. Any government going into an election with nothing to say is very significant,” O’Connor says. “So far the Liberal government has had nothing to say. If I otherwise liked something about the Liberal Party agenda, what would I be voting for in the next four years on climate change and biodiversity? I don’t know.” Even with bipartisan support for the transition to renewable energy and the state having a head start on other jurisdictions, South Australia is not without its problems. Emissions from power generation are falling, but according to the Department for Environment and Water those from road transport are growing fast. They are now the biggest source of emissions in the state. While this might be considered fertile ground for new policy proposals on freight, public transport, cycling and electric vehicles, the response from the incumbent Liberals has been “business as usual” on environmental issues – consistent with the party’s broader budget-conscious and austerity-minded campaign. On electric vehicles, for example, the Liberal government introduced an incentive scheme to encourage uptake that included a $3,000 subsidy program. These incentives were welcomed by industry, but they were not as generous as New South Wales’ program, as they also introduced an EV user charge that discourages people from making a switch. The government is instead relying on its environmental record. It promises to continue work on the expansion of port infrastructure at Port Bonython on the Eyre Peninsula to facilitate hydrogen exports, as well as engaging in early talks to convert the Nyrstar lead refinery at Port Pirie to renewable energy and agricultural projects around carbon farming and lowering methane emissions. Speaking to Guardian Australia, the environment minister, David Spiers, says the Liberal government’s approach to the climate crisis had prioritised building the infrastructure needed for private industry to do the heavy lifting on the transition. “We will be continuing our trajectory around what I think is a really strong platform that we put in place with our climate action plan,” Spiers says. “We’ve had a plan out there for the best part of the year. It will be business as usual but not in a way where there is low ambition. “[We will be] transitioning our economy, getting everything in place, and focusing on two or three areas, agriculture, transportation, hydrogen and carbon and sequestration and storage.” The refusal to expand on what the party would do if returned to government has environment groups in South Australia concerned. In the lead up to the election, the South Australian Conservation Council – a coalition of groups with more than 100,000 members – issued a survey to both major parties, the Greens and SA Best. The Liberal Party, however, refused to participate, responding instead with a statement highlighting past achievements. Spiers, known for colourful attacks on political opponents, says the party did not participate because he believed the survey was “stacked against us” and describes its organisers as “a bit of a joke”. The chief executive of the Conservation Council SA, Craig Wilkins, stands by the scorecard, its methodology and the responses which are published on its website. “It was a near identical process in 2018, when the Liberal Party was in opposition and eager to get our support. They were quite happy to follow through and provide comments at the time,” Wilkins says. Wilkins says the creation of Australia’s largest national park in the Munga-Thirri-Simpson desert was “the most important environmental outcome” from the Marshall government during its term but “no party can be allowed to coast and sit on their laurels”. Against this backdrop the Labor opposition has sought to distinguish itself by putting a new $593m government-owned 200MW green hydrogen power plant at the centre of its election pitch. Labor’s deputy leader, Susan Close, says under current plans the project would be built near Whyalla to support nearby industrial operations, including the local steelworks, but could be opened up to later export clean energy. “Our view is if we’re going to continue to have manufacturing in Australia it’s going to have to go green quickly. This is our contribution to that,” Close says. The proposal was dismissed by the Liberal Party, which says the cost of construction was likely to blow out to $1.2b, while Whyalla locals have raised concerns over whether it will interfere with the migration of giant cuttlefish in the Upper Spencer Gulf. “There will be no trouble for the cuttlefish,” Close said. “We would never do that.” Both Labor and the Greens say they would support a range of changes if in a position to decide policy after Saturday. They include an expansion of schemes to support solar and battery systems in low-income households, a world heritage application for the Great Australian Bight and the introduction of a state biodiversity act. A looming issue that will carry over, and is likely to remain vexed whatever the election result, is the construction of a federal nuclear waste dump at Kimba on the Eyre peninsula. Labor, the Greens and independents all oppose the dump. Wilkins says the federal government has just assumed “they’ll just be able to roll it out and somehow South Australians will accept it and everyone will move on”, but that may not the case, and the election could throw its future into doubt. “This facility is supposed to be there for nearly 100 years,” Wilkins said. “That raises big questions, I would have thought.”",News/Australia news,Environmental policies are taking a back seat in the SA election.

3/18/2022,"I’ve been single for seven years now after previously being a serial monogamist. I’ve been very happy that I’ve taken this time to work on myself alone and find out what I want, so I’m in a much happier place now. I feel ready to start dating again but have no confidence thanks to putting on weight since I last dated which I’m struggling to lose. How can I build my confidence while trying to improve my health and establish a new dating life? Eleanor says: Your experience here gets to the heart of something modern dating makes it very easy to forget: attractiveness has very little to do with raw appearance. I think we can overlook that because so many of the faces we encounter daily are still, frozen – pictures on Instagram, or flat posters on the side of a bus. It makes it perilously easy to miss that real attractiveness lives in how a person moves, talks, carries themselves. In a word, it’s how they live. In some sense we know that already – most of us have had the experience of being driven wild by someone who doesn’t tick the magazine boxes, or discovered that someone notably beautiful turns out to be kind of sparkless. We all know you could 3D print a mathematically symmetrical face and stick it on a perfectly proportioned body and still find the resulting animatron less attractive than someone who’s warm, mysterious, charming or funny. But though that’s how we find others attractive, we tend to forget it about ourselves. We go back to evaluating the flat, still version of ourselves in a mirror or a picture. We never get to see the animated expressions or mannerisms that might light other people’s fires. Try not to make that mistake when you’re prepping for a date or trying to feel more confident. Don’t see yourself as a rigid object, like a cutout in a museum being evaluated by people with tape measures. Imagine yourself instead as what you are – a person, with stories and laughs and the ability to invite someone else into your world. Especially don’t make that mistake about what you weigh, a fact which shouldn’t dare make you feel sexless. It can really help build that animated confidence to put yourself in situations and outfits which make you feel most like yourself. People can tell when your real self shows up – they tend to like it. Don’t worry about orchestrating dates you think other people would expect, or dressing how you think others would or should. Give yourself the things that make you feel like you. After all, that’s what you’re hoping someone will fall for. All that said, some amount of rejection is inevitable. In even the few years you’ve had off the dating scene, you can expect to find massive divergences in people’s expectations about who talks to who first, what each gesture “means”, what can be done without causing offence – or even how much it matters to cause offence. The best principle for dealing with the occasional sting is to remember: they’re just some person. You wouldn’t defer to other people’s verdicts about anything else they’d spent a maximum of a few days thinking about, so don’t listen to other people’s judgments about you when they’ve only known you that long. An opinion about you formed by a functional stranger is about as useful as medical advice on a bathroom wall: it’s not. You deserve to have fun in the dating scene. Start by relating to yourself with the same principle we use for others: attraction responds to people, not just bodies. Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

3/18/2022,"In the couple of weeks since his death, just as in the 30 years preceding it, people have loved talking about Shane Warne taking one for 150 on debut. The story is salutary, a moral of modesty preceding triumph, the numbers considered a chastening start to a career of statistical marvels. This week the torch was passed as another Australian leg-spinner endured a difficult debut. But if you had offered Mitchell Swepson one for 150 in the second innings of the Test in Karachi, he would have accepted with delight. Taking 1 for 150 would have won Australia the match. In the end Swepson returned zero for 156, passing Warne’s run total in his second-last over as Pakistan held on for a draw in one of Test cricket’s most extraordinary escapes. The other number in the equation – the one wicket – he could and should have had. Twice in two balls he found the edge of Babar Azam’s bat, with difficult close catches missed on both sides of the wicket. The next over he was denied a stone-dead leg-before appeal by a slender technicality. Then, with three overs left, the most straightforward chance went down – a simple drop at cover.The first reprieves came when Pakistan’s captain had already made 161, but he would bat another 29 overs before his dismissal, and Pakistan another 41 overs to reach safety. The lbw shout was against Mohammad Rizwan, the other linchpin who finished on 105 not out. Directly in line, keeping low and hitting the stumps: so agreed the human eye and the ball-tracking data. Not the umpire, though, because Rizwan had advanced, and an umpire’s call exception relies for impact more than three metres from the stumps. Two red lights and one orange saw Rizwan survive. Had either he or Babar fallen with so long to go, Australia surely would have forced the win.The final drop may not have changed the result: Usman Khawaja shelled Rizwan with 18 balls remaining in the match. But that would have left Australia with three overs to dismiss two more of Pakistan’s bottom three batters, who would each have been intensely nervous. It would have given the visiting team a serious chance.In total, Swepson did not have a good match. A vital run-out in Pakistan’s first innings prompted a collapse, which he finished off with his first two Test wickets. But the trajectory didn’t continue through a fourth innings set up for him off-spinner Nathan Lyon: a lead of 506, nearly six sessions to bowl, on a pitch whose moderate wear and tear was only evident late in the game. Swepson bowled four spells on the day before, bowling too often around leg stump and being worked for runs without great risk. His start on day five was terrible, a barrage of full tosses that cost plenty.But his second spell on the final day showed what he can do, landing a good line around middle and off stump, turning sharply at times away from the bat, skidding through at others, and creating those three opportunities. With a lead that big, Australia could accommodate his bad spells in trade for the good, which would have been enough to turn the result. It wasn’t down to Swepson that the chances were not realised. There will be angst for Australia about the recent failures to finish off Test matches with the ball from outrageously strong positions: the losses at Headingley 2019 and Brisbane 2021, the draws at Sydney in the last two Australian summers running, and now this epic at Karachi. But for those who follow the game more than a team, these comebacks have been a thrill. Pakistan’s 443 for 7 was the sixth-largest total ever made in the fourth innings. Three of the bigger scores have come in losses, only two have come in matches saved.Babar Azam’s contribution was even more impressive. Only six players have made double-centuries in the fourth innings of a Test. He nearly became the seventh, falling for 196. More importantly, he batted 603 minutes, an effort in the final innings only exceeded by Michael Atherton’s famous innings against South Africa back in 1995. Only Atherton and two others have faced more deliveries. A truly impossible match to save was saved, and a long-awaited series now becomes a historical throwback, coming down to the third Test match tied at 0-0 with everything riding on that last result.",Sport/Sport,"Pakistan did the impossible, now Australia must avoid repeat of history | Geoff Lemon",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/18/pakistan-did-the-impossible-now-australia-must-avoid-repeat-of-history
3/18/2022,"Motor homes intended for Lismore residents whose houses were inundated in this month’s floods are lying empty because linen and water sources have not been organised, while housing “pods” promised by the New South Wales government are yet to materialise. The measures were announced as part of a temporary housing package last week, but three weeks on from the flood, thousands of locals are still living in evacuation centres due to the lacklustre speed of official support. More than 3,600 homes across the NSW northern rivers have been deemed uninhabitable due to floods by State Emergency Services assessors, and the premier, Dominic Perrottet, has said recovery could take years. Last Thursday, the NSW government announced a $285m temporary housing support package – half funded by the commonwealth – for 25,000 flood-affected residents, of which $248m will be spent on providing 16 weeks of rental support. The package included several measures designed to provide accommodation for residents facing months without permanent housing, including a $10m initiative to deliver 120 motor homes, to be split between Casino, Lismore and Ballina. On Wednesday, 40 motor homes arrived at the Lismore Centra Tourist Park. However, as of Thursday afternoon, when Guardian Australia visited the park, the mobile homes were sitting empty. A source familiar with the rollout of the mobile homes said flood-affected residents had been unable to check into the mobile homes because linen and a water source for the homes had yet to be organised. It was expected people would be able to move in from Friday. Most of the mobile homes seen in Lismore were modestly sized, featuring a kitchenette and dining area that converted into a bed, and did not appear to be able to accommodate more than two people. It is understood that 40 mobile homes destined for Ballina will not arrive until next week, but the first 40 have been delivered to Casino and it is understood almost all are now occupied. The NSW government also said it would spend $20m on temporary housing “pods” – shipping container-style structures delivered to rural property owners to allow them to stay on their land while rebuilding their home – similar to those delivered to communities affected by the black summer bushfires. However, a NSW government spokesman said the pods had not yet been procured. A source familiar with the mobile housing rollout said they had “no idea at all” about the status of the pods. NSW Labor’s spokesman for emergency services, Jihad Dib, said the rollout of the mobile homes and the pods “is just more evidence that the Perrottet government was completely unprepared for this weather event, in terms of its response and recovery”. “In addition to our concern [that] this is such a small number, the question to be asked is why some are still vacant,” Dib said. He said the NSW government “has real questions to answer about whether the number of motor homes and pods will be enough to house the many thousands of people who have lost their homes”. Labor has been calling for a parliamentary inquiry into the flood response. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Neither the office of Perrottet nor that of the NSW flood recovery minister, Steph Cooke, was able to provide details of how many pods the government was sourcing and when they would be delivered. A Resilience NSW spokesperson said “a number of people who were in the evacuation centre in Lismore have already been allocated motorhomes in Casino” and that “they are being allocated by the Department of Communities and Justice based on an assessment of urgent need”. Simon Robinson, who is unable to live in his South Lismore home due to flood damage, said he had heard of the government announcement about mobile homes but had not been able to find out how to be considered for one. He believes it could be months before he can return to living in his house. “It’s a bit ridiculous to think they are sitting here in Lismore, empty, when you think how desperate some of us are,” Robinson said. “To be able to have a mobile home would give you a base to be secure, and that’s significant for someone like me, as I don’t even have a suitcase right now, I’m living out of plastic bags of donated clothes.”",News/Australia news,Motor homes for flood-affected Lismore residents empty while more temporary housing yet to arrive,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/18/motor-homes-for-flood-affected-lismore-residents-empty-while-more-temporary-housing-yet-to-arrive
3/18/2022,"The former chief of the defence force Chris Barrie says defence personnel are not allowed to speak out on the national strategic threats posed by climate change without prior approval from Peter Dutton’s office. The suggestion was immediately rejected by the defence minister’s office. Asked for comment, the minister’s spokesperson said: “That is not correct.” Barrie is the Australian chair of the Global Military Advisory Council on Climate Change and authored the 2015 report Climate Change, Security and the ADF. He made the remarks while addressing the 2022 Fenner conference on sustainable agriculture in Canberra, where he outlined the security threats Australia faced as a result of global warming. Barrie said when he lectured on the threats caused by climate change in the defence headquarters in Canberra, they were filled with attendees interested in the subject. “Most of them would like to be out there speaking but they’re not allowed to unless they go through Peter Dutton’s office,” Barrie said. “These people live in our community, they are part of our community and they understand what is going on. “I think it’s a disgrace that we’ve made a left-right issue out of climate change, or global warming and its impact, because frankly, we are all on planet Earth. “We are all involved in this issue … as I’ve been saying, over the last few weeks, it’s going to require all of us to do something about it.” The executive director of the Australian Defence Association, Neil James, said there were very few military, academic or civilian strategic security analysts who did not consider climate change a serious problem. But there was an important principle for defence personnel staying out of politics. “The last thing you want is your defence force involving themselves in politics,” James said. “If you want to keep the gun out of politics, you want to keep politics out of the gun. It’s actually a principle. That’s why you have an institutionally non-partisan defence force.” James said the reason there were “not too many climate deniers” in the strategic security sector is because it was a science-based discipline. “But it’s also one very much informed by history. And you’ve only got to look at history to know the effects climate has on various things. “There’s a school of thought among historians and anthropologists that in the final analysis, all wars in human history have been fought over access to water. And that’s largely true … it’s the effects [that] climate change will have on different countries and on international trade, and on access to water and resources.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Barrie described the coming federal election as the most important of his lifetime and urged the audience to demand “full disclosure” of all politicians regarding their plans in office. “A return in my view to a proper version of Westminster system should see the best candidate in every seat return. I hope there will be many more women in the next parliament too and maybe then we will see the leadership we urgently need,” Barrie said. Barrie said the “elephant in the room was global population”, with projections of 10 billion people by 2050, which he described as the “maximum carrying capacity”.

3/18/2022,"Victorian business leaders pushing to scrap mask mandates for hospitality and retail workers are “clearly not following the trend” in rising cases, according to epidemiologists who say now is not the time to relax rules. The state’s premier, Daniel Andrews, on Thursday rejected a push from the Australian Hotels Association, the Australian ­Retailers Association and the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who told the Herald Sun they wanted national consistency on mask mandates and warned workers could leave the sectors for other jobs. Masks are compulsory for retail and hospitality workers in Victoria, whereas they are only recommended in New South Wales and there are no requirements in Queensland. Michael Toole, an epidemiologist at Melbourne’s Burnet Institute said the business groups advocating a change in Victoria were “clearly not following the trend in cases”. “This is just not the right time. Victoria needs to just stay steady,” he said. “People who say Victoria has the strictest mask rules should look at the difference between the trend in Victoria and NSW.” Victoria recorded seven deaths and 9,752 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday, the state’s highest figure since 10 February. Health authorities on Wednesday revealed the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant had become the dominant strain of the virus in Victoria and warned cases were expected to rise in the coming month. NSW authorities recorded five deaths and 20,087 cases on Thursday, and are expecting case numbers in the state to double by the middle of April. Toole said NSW should reintroduce mask mandates in all indoor public spaces, including for employees and customers in hospitality and retail settings. “If it keeps going like this they also need to also consider density limits and stop singing and dancing,” he said. “With Victoria, I would keep the current rules as we’re in a very different setting.” But Toole said both states should encourage residents to wear N95 masks given the rise in cases. He said rather than removing masks entirely, employers should give hospitality and retail workers frequent breaks to provide respite. “It’s tough but doctors have been doing it for decades. It’s a matter of management,” he said. Chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, Catherine Bennett, agreed that maintaining current restrictions for a few more weeks would allow Victoria to determine if the uptick in cases would translate to a spike in hospitalisations. “I wouldn’t be encouraging the health department to reduce extra rules at the moment but I also don’t think we should put rules back in,” she said. “If this continues to not translate to hospitalisations and numbers stay reasonably low as they are now, then that could be revisited.” Head of the University of Melbourne’s school of population and global health, Nancy Baxter, said advocating to reduce mask usage amid rising cases was “down the rabbit hole thinking”. “Rising numbers should mean we do more to protect our community, not less,” she said. “At a minimum, workers who are required to be exposed to many strangers daily as part of their work should have protections – it’s a basic occupational health and safety issue. “These protections in no way limit their ability to do their jobs.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning However, Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases professor at the Australian National University said Victoria should align its mask mandate with NSW and Queensland. “Masks do give you some protection, a surgical mask about 10-15% and a cloth mask a little less. Masks might decrease the spread and flatten the curve a bit rather than completely change the numbers,” he said. “If you’re mandating to stop people getting the virus, eye protection is equally as important as a mask.” But Collignon said masks had advantages for older people who were at a higher risk of getting seriously ill or dying if they contracted the virus. Andrews said there was no plan to change the state’s mask settings. “We have masks on in very few settings at the moment. I know they’re frustrating, but at the end of the day, compare where we were six months ago and then six months before that,” told reporters on Thursday. Victorian opposition leader, Matthew Guy, said he wants masks scrapped in retail and hospitality and for primary school students in years 3 to 6. Students in grades prep to 2 and those in year 7 to 11 are not required to wear masks. General manager of the Mulgrave Country Club in east Melbourne, Kerry Scarlett, said employees should be able to choose whether they want to wear a mask. “We’ve got an older demographic of people who come here and it’s difficult to communicate with customers through a mask when we’re taking food and drink orders which is a big issue,” she said. “They aren’t welcoming as you can’t see our beautiful smiles.” Scarlett also said the inconsistency of QR code check-ins, that are required in hospitality venues as part of the vaccinated economy but not retail settings, also frustrated the industry.",News/Australia news,‘Just not the right time’: Victoria urged to keep mask rules for key workers,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/18/just-not-the-right-time-victoria-urged-to-keep-mask-rules-for-key-workers
3/18/2022,"Imagine a future even more dystopian than the present – a world where catastrophic climate change meets catastrophic income inequality. In this near future, floods and fires get more intense and the government’s response remains sluggish. So the wealthy take matters into their own hands. They leave the poor to use the degraded public emergency services, while the rich are rescued by private means – a fleet of helicopters to get them to safety, private firefighters to protect their homes, the use of satellite phones and access to secure food sources and fresh water. It’s not such a leap. The rich are already buying their way out of the pointy end of the climate crisis. In 2018 when wildfires tore through California, Kim Kardashian’s mansion was reportedly saved by private firefighters, operated by her insurance company. The rich are also buying their way out of the climate emergency with elaborate contingency plans. You see it with the PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel buying a very large bolthole in New Zealand, and wealthy Australians buying land in Tasmania to escape the worst ravages of climate change. And I’m sure we’ll see it in the aftermath of the northern New South Wales and Queensland floods. The rich can either afford to insure, or add protective measures such as extensive drainage and flood proofing, or get out altogether, cut their losses and move to higher ground. Those in south Lismore at the caravan park, who relied on neighbours to rescue them on a jet ski, often can’t afford to insure, let alone move out. The story of the Kardashian’s home being saved from fire is not a freaky celebrity one-off – it’s the canary in the neoliberal coalmine, it’s the “story of the ramifications of economic disparity in this country”, wrote the Atlantic. People buy safety in the US – not just safety from climate change, but safety from each other. They install elaborate security systems, or live in gated communities, and in the case of the University of Chicago, amass one of the largest private police forces in the US to protect students and university property. So where do we stand in Australia? Right now, at a crossroads. Will the state step up and look after us in the face of climate emergencies (and furthermore will they take action to mitigate the emergencies?) or will they abandon the field, leaving us to rely on volunteers, community action and services that may have coped prior to the acceleration of the Anthropocene age, but certainly not now? I think we know the answer. “I don’t hold a hose mate,” is more than a statement of fact that Scott Morrison doesn’t actually, like, hold a hose. It is a mission statement of a government withdrawing from the battlefield. Hawaii is also a metaphor, that’s why it still looms and sticks in the craw years later. The Morrison government nicked off long ago. We’re on our own. Instead, Australians must make do and rely on mateship and community to get them through. Emergency services elders have begged, as they beg each summer, for the government to do something – but the government simply does not seem to listen. “The government knew what was coming and it did not adequately prepare our communities or first responders,” Greg Mullins, the former NSW fire and rescue commissioner said this week. In Australia, this retreat from the commons (the national project) is not a new thing, and it’s not just climate change related. We see it in the sale of and reduction in public housing. We see it in the lack of funding of public libraries. We see it in the tax incentives for private health insurance. We see it in middle class people abandoning the public school sector to send their kids to private schools – and we see governments incentivising this in the lavish funding of the private sector. In recent years private school funding has increased at five times the rate of public school funding. In the years before this summer of floods, we have certainly seen a retreat from the commons at an intense level where the disaster actually hit. Since the pandemic, there has been an acceleration of the movement of wealth towards the north coast of NSW. Byron Bay property prices are now more expensive than Sydney. The result has been a complete collapse of a variety of social contracts in those communities. The most significant collapse is the one related to housing. The contract goes something like this: you work in this community as a chef, a teacher, an ambulance officer, and you will be housed in that community and build deep roots there. But that social contract has broken down under the pressure of the enormous wealth that has migrated to the region, and lack of government protection and support for those less wealthy. Prior to the devastating floods, the people in northern NSW have already been schooled in seeing the impact of immense wealth disparity in their region. In Australia’s drift from the public to the private sector, it’s not necessarily the public rejecting the commons but the government nudging citizens away from public utilities designed for public use – via a range of tax incentives and a deliberate neglect or running down of government services. This drift towards the private sector doesn’t occur in a vacuum. An assessment of other options – of options that exist outside the state – occurs when the state has vacated the field, where the state is not adequately resourced, or where the scale of the problem is too large for the current solutions. And so we prep. Perhaps you’re looking around where you live right now, and doing a form of disaster prepping in your head. You might be noticing the summers getting drier or once in 500 year floods occurring every few years, and you might be thinking: how am I going to save and protect my property? And how am I going to save and protect myself and my family? When you prep, you do so as an individual or family unit. You do not prep your entire region, and as a result many in your community will get left behind. We have to bring prepping into the commons (the degraded commons, but one that exists nonetheless), so we can all prep together. Last week, speaking in Lismore before Morrison’s appearance, helicopter pilot Rich Latimer called for government and volunteer groups to unify to prepare for the next disaster. “The message we really want to pass is: we need unification,” he said. “We need communities to realise that we need to prepare ourselves for this more and more … and really drop the message of us and them, and the polarisation.” Money might save your house, but do you really want to live in a country where the poor drown and the rich are saved?",Opinion/Opinion,"Money might save your property, but who wants to live in a country where the poor drown and the rich are saved? | Brigid Delaney",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/17/money-might-save-your-property-but-who-wants-to-live-in-a-country-where-the-poor-drown-and-the-rich-are-saved
3/18/2022,"The United States and its allies need to strike a balance between making Putin’s appalling invasion in Ukraine as costly as possible, while avoiding uncontrolled escalation that could lead to a much broader and more dangerous war. So far, the White House has managed to walk this tightrope, but it’s almost certain to grow harder the longer the war goes on, as Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s impassioned address to the US Congress on Wednesday demonstrated. Naturally, for the Ukrainian president, the more involved Nato gets, the better. Ukraine’s chances of repelling the Russian invaders on the battlefield may be slim, but with luck and the world’s support, there’s still hope that he will survive long enough that Putin has no alternative but to negotiate an end to war that leaves Ukraine’s sovereignty intact. Right now, this seems like the best of any realistic outcome. Nato has a clear interest in ensuring that Putin comes out the war thinking it was a bad idea. This will make him less likely to attack Nato itself in the future. But the White House would nevertheless be wise to avoid rushing in and upping its military ante in response to Zelenskiy’s address. America and its allies are already doing far more to help Ukraine than anyone would have expected just a month ago and there are better ways to help Ukraine end the war. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy repeated his request for a no fly zone, couching it as “humanitarian” in nature. But setting up a no-fly zone over Ukraine, humanitarian or otherwise, would almost certainly mean going to war with Russia. A no-fly zone would require Nato to attack Russian air defense systems in the theater and possibly inside Russia. Nato pilots would then have to fire on any Russian aircraft flying within the zone over Ukraine or threatening them from within Russian airspace itself. Even if Nato were prepared to do all this and invite a war with Russia, a no fly zone wouldn’t stop Russian forces from bombing Ukrainian cities and civilians from the ground or with missiles. This could create massive pressure for Nato planes to strike those forces as well. In short, this is a surefire recipe for mission creep and escalation. Zelensky probably knew that his call for a no-fly zone was already an uphill battle with Congress and the American people, despite the fulmination of the Washington hawks. A CBSNews poll conducted last week suggests that many Americans support a no-fly zone until they’re told it would mean war against Russia. After that, far fewer think it’s a good idea. Perhaps reflecting this, congressional views on the no-fly zone are similarly tepid or outright opposed. But Zelenskiy also asked for S-300 air defense systems and MiG-29 fighter jets. Here there is much more support in Washington. Zelenskiy’s call for a no-fly zone may even have been a negotiating tactic to increase the chances of getting MiG-29s and S-300s, as Representative Tom Malinowski, for example, speculated. Republicans have been especially keen to pressure Biden to send these jets to Ukraine, but the idea has also received some bipartisan support. The White House should refrain from doing so, however, because it would be largely symbolic. It’s true that delivering fighters jets and air defense systems would be less escalatory than establishing a no fly zone. Ukraine already has both weapons and sending them more would not require attacks Russia. But neither the S-300 nor the MiG-29 promises to have much of an impact on the outcome of the war. For example, it’s uncertain whether the Ukrainian air force can actually use the jets on offer from Poland without additional training. Only a few Nato members actually have S-300 air defense systems that could be transferred to Ukraine, and even if they are its unclear whether they would do much to slow the Russian advance, which has so far mainly relied on Russian ground forces. Right now, it would be more helpful to the Ukrainians if the United States and its allies clarified the conditions under which they might lift some of the sanctions now poised to crush the Russian economy. A host of sanctions on the Russian financial sector, Russian leaders, and key sectors of the Russian economy are now in place. It would be the wrong move to lift them all, but offering to lift some might entice Putin to pull his forces back. America and Europe’s response to the war is already unprecedented in military, economic, and political terms. Russia now faces crushing sanctions with far-reaching consequences for its economy and the wealth of the Putin cabal that governs the country. Ukraine has meanwhile received a steady stream of weapons, including anti-armor, anti-aircraft, light armor and military supplies to the tune of $1b. These weapons are themselves hardly insignificant. The Javelin anti-tank system, for example, pierces the advanced armor of Russian tanks, injecting a stream of molten metal into the tank’s cabin, that vaporizes any organic matter inside. American aid to Ukraine, moreover, already comes at a significant cost and risk to America itself. Not only do Americans now face historically high gas prices, they also face increased risk that the sanctions could turn Russia into a giant North Korea, a major strategic problem for years to come. This is not to mention the risk of crippling cyber attacks or even a demonstration use of nuclear weapons to signal Russia’s seriousness. Sometimes in Washington the hardest thing to do during a crisis is to do nothing. The White House should continue to resist the pressure to up the military ante and make use of the economic levers it already has in place to get to Putin to end his war.
