""Our Cyber Security pathway at MHS has had tremendous success through student's earning industry certifications, participating in internships and leading the way in computer systems and information technology."" The statement continued: ""As always, our students should be valued and celebrated. It is a student and parents' choice to protect their health in a way they feel most appropriate.

While DeSantis is widely rumored to be preparing a 2024 presidential run, he is shot down that speculation, saying in previous interviews that he is ""not considering anything beyond doing my job."" The Republican governor, who narrowly won his 2018 election, is not without controversy. Still, he's worked to raise his national profile over the past few years, sometimes by fueling culture-war conflicts similar to former President Donald Trump. DeSantis has touted his decision not to impose widespread restrictions during the pandemic (though it's worth noting he did order a statewide lockdown in April 2020) but he has faced much scrutiny for his handling of the virus. He opposed mandating public health measures in the state and attempted to block local leaders' authority to issue mask mandates in municipalities throughout the state. RELATED: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Downplays 2024 Aspirations: 'Not Considering Anything' Last July, DeSantis issued an order barring local school districts from requiring students to wear masks, despite federal recommendations that all students in kindergarten through 12th grade wear face coverings when they return to the classroom in the fall.

3/4/2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A Northern California woman whose disappearance and mysterious reappearance set off a frantic three-week search more than five years ago was arrested Thursday on charges of lying to federal agents about being kidnapped and defrauding the state's victim compensation board of $30,000. Sherri Papini, 39, of Redding, was found on Thanksgiving Day in 2016 after weeks of searching in California and several nearby states, with bindings on her body and injuries including a swollen nose and a “brand” on her right shoulder. She had been reported missing Nov. 2. She told authorities at the time that she had been kidnapped at gunpoint by two Hispanic women, even providing descriptions to an FBI sketch artist along with extensive details of her purported abduction. In reality, authorities said, she was staying with a former boyfriend nearly 600 miles (966 kilometers) away from her home in Orange County, in Southern California, and hurt herself to back up her false statements. “When a young mother went missing in broad daylight, a community was filled with fear and concern,” U.S. Attorney Phillip Talbert said in a statement. ""Ultimately, the investigation revealed that there was no kidnapping and that time and resources that could have been used to investigate actual crime, protect the community, and provide resources to victims were wasted.” Papini does not yet have an attorney because she was just arrested, Talbert's office said. Her first court appearance has not yet been set. She was still lying about the kidnapping in August 2020 when she was interviewed by a federal agent and a Shasta County sheriff’s detective, the charges allege. They showed her evidence indicating she had not been abducted and warned her that it was a crime to lie to a federal agent. But she still made false statements, the charges allege. She also was reimbursed more than $30,000 by the California Victim’s Compensation Board based on the false story, the charges said. They included money for visits to her therapist for “treatment for anxiety and PTSD,"" according to a court filing, and for the ambulance ride to the hospital after she surfaced near Sacramento. She faces a mail fraud charge related to the reimbursement requests that carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison, while lying to a federal officer has a maximum five-year sentence. “Everyone involved in this investigation had one common goal: to find the truth about what happened on Nov. 2, 2016, with Sherri Papini and who was responsible,"" said Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson. That 22-day search and five-year investigation not only cost money and time, he said, “but caused the general public to be fearful of their own safety, a fear that they should not have had to endure.” Before she disappeared, Papini had gone jogging near her home about 215 miles (350 kilometers) north of San Francisco. Her husband, Keith Papini, found only her cellphone and earphones when he went searching after she failed to pick up their children at day care. She left her purse and jewelry behind. Investigators said he passed a lie detector test. They also cleared a Detroit man they said Papini had texted and planned to meet shortly before her disappearance. He was in California at the time of her disappearance but told investigators they never met, though they had spent a weekend together in 2011. Papini's nose was swollen and she was wearing a chain restraint around her waist and one arm along with other bindings around her other wrist and each ankle when she was found alongside Interstate 5 nearly 150 miles from her home, according to a court filing Thursday. She had other bruises and rashes on many parts of her body, ligature marks on her wrists and ankles, and burns on her left forearm. Her blonde hair had been cut to shoulder length and she had a blurred “brand” burned into her right shoulder, authorities said at the time. She had both male and female DNA on her body and clothing. The DNA eventually led to the former boyfriend in 2020, according to a court filing. The former boyfriend told investigators that Papini stayed with him at his house during the time she was gone, and said she had asked him to come to Redding to pick her up, though he said they never had sex. His account was verified when authorities tracked the locations of two prepaid cellphones that they had been using to secretly talk to one another as early as December 2015, according to a 55-page affidavit filed in court to support the criminal charges. A cousin of the former boyfriend told investigators that he saw Papini in the man's apartment twice, both times unrestrained. About three weeks later, records backed the ex-boyfriend's story that he rented a car and drove Papini back to Northern California. A GoFundMe campaign raised more than $49,000 to help the family, which the couple used to pay off bills and for other expenses, according to the court filing. At the time, she was a stay-at-home mom and her husband worked at Best Buy. There was never a ransom demand, and the family wasn't wealthy, officials said at the time. In retrospect, “we are relieved that the community is not endangered by unknown, violent kidnappers,” said Sean Ragan, special agent in charge of the FBI's Sacramento Field Office.",U.S./Associated Press,"Prosecutors: Woman faked kidnapping, defrauded California",https://news.yahoo.com/california-woman-faked-kidnapping-defrauded-010104019.html
3/4/2022,"It was a family affair in late February aboard Sunshine and Whiskey, Micah Young’s custom-built 27-foot boat, which was launched from the Carroll Campbell Marine Complex in Georgetown. The plan was to catch Young’s father, John Young, a mess of black sea bass and run the boat in advance of competing in the ongoing South Carolina Wahoo Series. In late 2021, Micah Young, a Marine Biology teacher at Wilson High School in Florence, headed north from the Winyah Bay jetties to a bottom spot and found a very nice grade of black sea bass, much larger than the 13-inch minimum size limit, in about 40 feet of water. The Youngs, with Micah’s 15-year-old son Thomas and brother Kevin also aboard, returned to the same spot and quickly found black sea bass were still there, readily hitting mullet and squid, but the fish were a smaller grade. As usual, Micah Young worked a Bluewater Candy Roscoe jig on the spot soon after they got set up. “A lot of people use those for black sea bass, especially targeting the big ones. I don’t pull up on any (spot) that I don’t put a jig down — anything will hit them. I always put one down first and give that a whirl while everybody else is fishing with bait.” After about 15 minutes, Micah Young hooked up with a fish bigger than he expected on the jig in about 40 feet of water. “To be honest, I’ve heard rumors over the years, especially around Beaufort, of people catching goliath grouper,” said Micah Young, who was using a medium-class setup with a Quantum reel and 20-pound test. “The way the fish was pulling, I couldn’t think of anything else pulling that big in that shallow water. It kept digging in the structure like a 30-40 pound grouper. “I couldn’t do much, I couldn’t put too much pressure on (the fish). Once we got him off the wreck, he headed north and just went. We had to follow him like you would a really big king.” After about 30 minutes they finally got a good look at the fish and knew it wasn’t a goliath grouper. “When we saw it we thought it was a 100-pound redfish,” said Micah Young. “It was gold, a beautiful fish. Then it rolled over and we immediately saw it was a black drum.” They worked to get the fish in the boat for a quick photo op before the all-important release. Young estimated the old female spawner weighed 80-90 pounds and was 12 inches thick. “Going black sea bass fishing and pulling this up, this was just crazy,” said Young. “I’m 6-2, 230 pounds and it was all I could do to hoist that thing up to get a picture.” Then it was on to the release, as black drum are governed by a 14-27 inch slot limit in South Carolina waters. “I’ve taught Marine Biology for 22 years, and to make sure that fish survives is important,” said Young. “That fish is probably 50-60 years old. The pic was taken quick — I was adamant we were not going to let her die. We pulled her along with the boat and she kicked and took off. Then we stayed right there where I dropped her.” Young, 49, has been fishing from Georgetown to Murrells Inlet since he was a youngster, and was exhilarated with the catch and release. “It took me 40 years to catch a fish like that,” said Young. On a standard near-shore bottom-fishing trip the Youngs ended up with a catch of a lifetime, and their mess of black sea bass to boot.
