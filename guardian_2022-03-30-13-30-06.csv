3/30/2022,"Apart from two early lambs, there are few signs of spring yet in the Howgill Fells. Inside the sheds we have 60 cattle, eating the hay and silage that was made in our meadows last summer. Soon it will be time for them to be turned out to the fields or sold on to another farm. Some of last year’s calves are to be sold, and so this morning we must test them for tuberculosis before they can move. We’ve never had TB, but because there are farmers in our area who have, we are under restrictions. These restrictions are needed for public safety, but are a drain on our own time, money and emotional resources. It is still below freezing when the vet arrives with a hat pulled tightly over her ears, and she begins the process of disinfecting herself before handling our cattle. She fills a bucket with disinfectant and water, and brushes her wellies and waterproof trousers down carefully. I ask if any TB has been found in the area this week. “Not at my jobs, no.” I remark that she must be a lucky charm. “Please don’t say that, I don’t want to jinx things,” she says. We are all a little nervous this morning. The cows are waiting in the ancient stone pens that were used by drovers in the 18th century when this was a coaching inn, sending up clouds of steamy breath as they jostle about, wondering what is going to happen next. The cattle crush – the piece of steel machinery that holds them in place – is moved in front of the gate so they can be held safely as the vet looks at the two sites on their necks where she injected TB earlier this week. She holds a pair of plier-like instruments in one hand to measure any swelling, and a clipboard in the other. I’ve hardly slept this week. The consequences for the cattle and for our farm business will be huge if TB is found. The first cow comes in and the crush closes around his head. I feel a little faint, and I hope that my world is not about to close in around me.

3/30/2022,"Scott Morrison has told renters that the best way the government can support them is to help them buy a home, in what housing experts have described as a “let them eat cake” moment. The prime minister made the comment on Channel Nine’s Today show on Wednesday morning after being asked why there was not more support for renters in the federal budget handed down on Tuesday night. “This is about Australians getting into homes,” Morrison said. “The best way to support people renting a house is to help them buy a house.” Morrison said the expansion of the home loan guarantee scheme, which allows people to borrow up to 95% of the value of their property without having to take out mortgage insurance, was support for people struggling with rental affordability because “people buying houses are renters”. “Ensuring that more renters can buy their own home and get the security of home ownership, that was one of the key focuses of this budget and was one of the key pledges that I’ve delivered on since the last election,” he said. Dr Chris Martin, a housing policy expert at the University of New South Wales, said the prime minister’s comment was “a real let them eat cake moment”. “Thirty percent of low income people on the private rental market do not have $500 in savings for emergencies, let alone a 5% deposit for a home loan,” Martin said. He said the first home loan guarantee, which was doubled to 50,000 places a year in the budget, would “help a relatively few people who are already in a position close to attaining home ownership”. “This guarantee allows them to borrow more than they would otherwise be able to and outbid someone at an auction, possibly setting a new price at the same time.” Martin said the $2bn increase to the government guaranteed liability cap of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, which raises the total cap to $5.5m, was welcome but not enough to reverse decades of underfunding of the social housing sector. “Social housing is not funded to grow,” he said. “It has been on starvation rations for the last 20-30 years and it is still on starvation rations in this budget.” Dr Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, said the federal government was “treating renters like second-class citizens”. “Renting should be a decent, secure, long term option for putting a roof over your head and having a home,” she said. “The best way to support renters is to lift their incomes so they can better afford rent, and build social housing.” Goldie said the $5bn commonwealth rental assistance program worked out at just $73 per week for a single person, an allocation that has not increased in real terms in more than 20 years. Meanwhile, rents in regional Australia have grown by 18% since the pandemic began. “The housing measures announced in last night’s budget will only push up house prices,” she said. “They won’t help people on the lowest incomes keep a roof over their head.” Dr Michael Fotheringham, the managing director of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, said a policy that assumed most people could buy a house, or even that they wanted to, was no longer fit for purpose. The proportion of Australians living in private rental properties, whether because of increased mobility or a lack of housing affordability, has grown as the proportion of people who own a home or live in social housing has fallen. “So we can’t just ignore it, and ignore how people are living within it,” Fotheringham said.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison says best way to help renters is to ‘help them buy a house’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/scott-morrison-says-best-way-to-help-renters-is-to-help-them-buy-a-house-federal-budget
3/30/2022,"The federal budget has delivered a boost to Indigenous rangers caring for country, but represents an “unconscionable” failure to close the gap in health and housing, Aboriginal organisations say. The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation described the budget as “short-changing” Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Naccho said structural reform and substantial funding were needed in order to close the gap in health and housing, and “business as usual” wasn’t going to work. Chief executive, Pat Turner, said she was disappointed that core funding for Aboriginal health services (Acchos) has remained the same. “I am also worried that the budget has assumed that Acchos’ expenditure will contract significantly after Covid. This may be a significant flaw in their modelling,” Turner said. Naccho said it commissioned a report from Equity Economics which, based on the government’s own data, puts the funding gap in Aboriginal health at $4.4bn, or roughly $5,042 for each Indigenous person. The commonwealth’s share of this shortfall is $2.6bn, according to the report. “As long as this $4.4bn funding gap remains and as long as there are funding gaps elsewhere – in particular, in housing – we cannot expect the unconscionable health gap to close. This budget is an opportunity lost,” Turner said. Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said the budget would deliver a “a stronger future for Indigenous Australians”. $223.8m has been allocated to Aboriginal housing in remote communities in 2022-23. Aboriginal community-controlled organisations estimate a $5bn investment in remote housing is needed nationally, according to Get Up’s First Nations justice campaigns director, Larissa Baldwin. “Even after two years of Covid highlighting the impacts of overcrowded housing, the government has failed to respond with increased funding for remote housing,” Baldwin said. $636.4m will fund another 2,000 ranger jobs in regional and remote Australia. The funding, guaranteed to 2028, will establish new ranger groups, and bring more Indigenous women into ranger work. “It will address the unmet demand for cultural burning and other Indigenous land management expertise,” Wyatt said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Country Needs People, the NGO dedicated to supporting Indigenous land and sea management, said the funding was “globally significant”. “Indigenous rangers are increasingly at the frontline of managing some of our most challenging environmental issues,” executive director, Patrick O’Leary said. “In a warming climate we will need all hands on deck to protect and manage our environment. “Traditional owners as the original managers of country are reasserting responsibility for keeping country healthy and we should be backing them,” O’Leary said. $37.5m will go towards strengthening the governance of Prescribed Bodies Corporate (PBCs), which manage the interests of native title holders. This funding will establish a steering group and expand training for directors and staff. $31.8m has been allocated to the design of local and regional voice structures. $1.9m will extend custody notification services (CNS) in Western Australia and the Northern Territory by one year, pending an evaluation of CNS in all jurisdictions to “inform a best practice model for all states and territories to implement”. CNS is a 24-hour phone service that provides welfare checks and legal advice to Aboriginal people, which police must notify when an Aboriginal person is taken into custody. But Aboriginal legal services have expressed disappointment there is no new funding to manage demand for their services. “I am truly devastated with this announcement,” executive officer of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal service, Jamie McConnachie, said. “Our communities suffer due to this severe under-resourcing. It is totally unreasonable to manage service delivery expectations with this appalling level of investment.” Labor’s Linda Burney said the government had failed to close the gap in life outcomes and “has simply decided to give up trying.” “The gap will never be closed without extra effort on health and decent housing for Indigenous people. This budget contains no measures for either,” Burney said.",News/Australia news,Federal budget continues ‘unconscionable’ failure to close the gap in Indigenous health,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/federal-budget-continues-unconscionable-failure-to-close-the-gap-in-indigenous-health
3/30/2022,"A speedy nationwide transition to electric vehicles powered by renewable energy would save more than 100,000 American lives and $1.2tn in public health costs over the next three decades, according to a new report. Analysis by the American Lung Association highlights the public health damage caused by the world’s dependence on dirty fossil fuels, and provides a glimpse into a greener, healthier future – should political leaders decide to act. According to the report, swapping gas vehicles for zero-emission new cars and trucks in the US would lead to 110,000 fewer deaths, 2.8m fewer asthma attacks and avoid 13.4m sick days by 2050. The shift would lead to a 92% fall in greenhouse gases by 2050, generating $1.7tn in climate benefits by protecting ecosystems, agriculture, infrastructure from rising sea levels and catastrophic weather events including drought and floods. Overall, communities of color and low-income neighborhoods would reap the biggest benefits from zero-emission technologies as they currently suffer disproportionately from air pollution and climate disasters, the study says. The calculations are based on transitioning to 100% electric cars sales by 2035 and 100% electric trucks by 2040, as well as ditching dirty fossil fuels for 100% renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric and nuclear by 2035. However, given political polarization in the US and a lack of political urgency, it seems highly unlikely that oil and gas companies will stop drilling or that American car dealers will be selling only electric cars by 2035. Joe Biden’s Build Back Better (BBB) legislation, which includes historic funds for climate initiatives, has failed to move through the Senate due to stonewalling by the Republicans and the conservative Democrat Joe Manchin, the fossil-fuel friendly senator from West Virginia. But the ALA report details the widespread health benefits that could be achieved if political leaders prioritized climate action over corporate profits. “The current rising gas and energy prices are a symptom of our addiction to fossil fuels. But outside the economic pain, there’s significant public health pain caused by our addiction to fossil fuels. Transitioning to zero-emission technologies and energy depends on strong political leadership and investments, in order to get the potential health benefits off the page and into the real world,” said Will Barrett, author of Zeroing in on Healthy Air. The scientific evidence is unequivocal. Any further delay in concerted global action to tackle the climate crisis will miss a rapidly closing window to secure a livable future, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In the US, transportation and energy are the biggest contributors to greenhouse gases and toxic air. At least four in 10 Americans – more than 135 million people – live in communities affected by unhealthy levels of air pollution which increase the risk of asthma attacks, strokes, lung cancer, heart attacks, impaired cognitive functioning, premature births and premature death. The greatest direct health risks are faced by those living close to highways, ports, rail yards, refineries, drilling sites, pipelines and power plants – who are disproportionately communities of color and low-income households. These health burdens are due to decades of inequitable land use policies and systemic racism. According to the ALA, a shift to zero-emission technologies compared with business as usual would lead to a 78% reduction in Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) – which can cause difficulty breathing, nausea, damage to the central nervous system and cancer. Nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are associated with increased ER visits and hospitalizations with asthma, could fall by 92%. (NOx and VOCs are building blocks for ozone – or smog.) Fine ​​particle (PM2.5) pollution, which elevates the risk of heart disease, lung cancer and asthma, would drop 61% by 2050. Every state stands to benefit, with more than half gaining at least $10bn in cumulative public health savings from a range of avoided health impacts like premature deaths, asthma emergencies and sick days. The country’s two most populated states – California and Texas – could save $100bn, while six others – Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, New York, Illinois and Michigan – stand to save at least $50bn by 2050. (Hawaii and Alaska were not included.) The hundred US counties, accounting for about 3% in total, with the highest proportion of people of color could experience about 13% of the cumulative health benefits of the green transport transition. The impacts of doing nothing are very real. As a child, Rohan Arora from the Washington DC area would rush to fetch his asthmatic father’s inhaler as he coughed and wheezed, triggered by the air pollution on his journey home from work. “It was almost every day, a hazard of living in a city, and sometimes he needed to go to the hospital. Transitioning to zero emissions and clean renewable energy is urgent,” said Arora, 21. Heavy-duty vehicles like cargo trucks account for just 6% of the national on-road fleet, but generate 31% of the total greenhouse gases in the transport sector. In short, cars produce more harmful planet-heating gases and air pollutants because there are so many of them on the road, but trucks are by far the more toxic. BBB legislation earmarks $555bn to tackle the energy and transport sectors through a variety of grants, tax incentives and other policies to boost jobs and technologies, as well as major investments in sustainable vehicles and public transit services. “Zero-emission transportation is a win-win for public health,” said Harold Wimmer, ALA’s president and CEO.",News/US news,"US transition to electric vehicles would save over 100,000 lives by 2050 – study",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/us-electric-vehicles-save-lives-public-health-costs-study
3/30/2022,"Holding smoking incense sticks and singing hymns, a group of Buddhist monks sat in front of the open coffins of four Russian soldiers killed fighting in Ukraine as hundreds of mourners gathered on Monday at a local sports centre in Ulan-Ude, the capital of the remote Buryatia region in Russia’s far east. “We are distraught. This bloodshed needs to stop. Our boys are dying,” said Olga Odoeva, the sister-in-law of Bulat Odoev, one of the four soldiers being buried. Odoev, who joined the military 10 years ago, was killed in battle outside Kyiv on 15 March, nearly 4,000 miles away from his home town. “He just didn’t want to let his team down. He felt it was his duty to go,” Olga said hours after the funeral finished. “Our family opinion on this differs from the one held by authorities, but what can we do?” Russia has only disclosed the most limited information about its losses in the war in Ukraine, saying that 1,351 of its soldiers have died in the fighting, a number that is far lower than the estimates made by Nato and Ukraine. Officials have also not provided the names of the dead or given any details about where they served, but as the war in Ukraine has entered its second month, group funerals such as the one of Odoev and his comrades, as well as reports by independent local media outlets, indicate that Buryatia, and other republics far away from the Kremlin, have been disproportionately affected by the conflict. “It is becoming clear that a lot of the soldiers who are dying are from the poorer ‘ethnic minority’ republics like Buryatia, Kalmykia and Dagestan,” said Pavel Luzin, a Russian military expert. Russia is divided into 85 federal subjects, 22 of which are republics, originally created as regions to represent areas of non-Russian ethnicity. Luzin said the lower ranks of the Russian army were particularly filled with young men from those republics who enlist after their mandatory conscription ends, mainly for financial reasons. “It is a golden ticket for many young guys to get out who don’t have any other prospects in life. The army offers a job, a decent salary, a future.” Buryatia, lying between Lake Baikal and Mongolia at the eastern end of Siberia, is one of the most impoverished of Russia’s regions, with an average monthly salary of just 44,000 rubles (£390), despite holding some of the country’s largest deposits of natural resources. Between 30% and 40% of its 1 million population are ethnic Buryats who traditionally practise a mixture of Buddhism and shamanism. Ludi Baikala, a small independent media outlet that covers the region, has so far identified and named 45 soldiers from Buryatia who have died in Ukraine, but it believes the real number is much higher. “The 45 are just the ones we managed to identify. There will be many more that are not talked about,” said Olga Mutovina, a journalist for Ludi Baikala. In other republics, local journalists’ investigations and rare admissions by officials also reveal a significant death toll. In Dagestan, Radio Svoboda reported that at least 130 soldiers from the mountainous Caucasus region had died, and a senator from Tuva on the Mongolian border has publicly said that 96 soldiers from her small republic were killed in Ukraine. If these numbers are accurate, the three republics of Buryatia, Dagestan and Tuva alone would make up almost a quarter of all the official Russian war deaths. “It is just so hard to find all the real names, and the authorities don’t like to publicise it while journalists choose not to write about it, fearing consequences,” said Mutovina. Russia has introduced a series of laws that threaten those who “knowingly” spread “fake news” about the Russian army and state bodies with fines and prison sentences of up to 15 years. Mutovina said that she and two of her colleagues were the only journalists who attended the funeral in Ulan-Ude on Monday, describing an “intense” atmosphere. “We did not expect all four bodies to be laid out at the same time with hundreds of grieving family members around them. “The foul odour of the dead bodies soon mixed with the Buddhist incense, creating a nauseating smell,” she said, adding that she and her colleagues were escorted away as soon as the local police realised they were journalists. Many soldiers from Buryatia fighting in Ukraine, including two of the men who were buried on Monday, are part of the 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade, which participated in the crucial battle for the Antonov airport two days into the invasion. But while the scale of the current conflict is unprecedented in modern Russian history, the country has a history of using Buryat soldiers to achieve its military goals. In 2015, numerous independent media outlets reported that a tank battalion from Buryatia was sent to Donbas to fight alongside Russian-backed separatists against the Ukrainian army, a conflict in which Russia has always denied involvement. Pointing to the war of 2015 and the present invasion, Luzin said there was also a darker, more cynical reason why scores of soldiers from the country’s more remote republics have been dying. “Unfortunately, the average Russian will care less about the death of a Buryat or Dagestani than about the death of blue-eyed soldiers from Moscow and St Petersburg,” Luzin said. “That also goes into the minds of those planning military operations. Buryat soldiers get sent on missions on which commanders wouldn’t send other troops.” Some local anger has started to spread over the increasingly noticeable number of Buryat soldiers dying. Vyacheslav Markhaev, a member of the state duma from Buryatia has been one of the few officials in the country who have condemned the war, accusing President Vladimir Putin of “hiding plans to unleash a full-scale war with our closest neighbour”. Buryats residing abroad have also launched a campaign called “Buryats against war”, saying they are the “only ethnic minority of Russia” which has initiated an anti-war movement. But ultimately, the mood in Buryatia itself remains calm, local people say, as a mixture of fear and genuine support for the war prevail. “I thought when the body bags would start coming back we would see more anger, maybe even a rise in Buryat nationalism. But so far that has not happened yet,” said Karina Pronina, another reporter at Ludi Baikala who lives in Ulan-Ude. She said the constant anti-Ukrainian messages aired on Russian stated television, which have appeared to galvanise support for Russian military actions across the country, also had an impact in Buryatia. Others who disagreed with the war said they were simply too scared to speak out, citing the “fake news” law. “There is a large group of younger Buryats who see what is really happening,” said one artist from Buryatia who asked to stay anonymous out of fear of prosecution. “We feel like we are dying in a war that isn’t ours to fight. But speaking out is dangerous.” For some, however, keeping quiet was not an option. Irina Ochirova has been holding one-person anti-war pickets after she recognised her captured son on a video shared online by Ukrainian Telegram channels just two days after the invasion. She has since started a campaign to retrieve her son Sergey, but complained that her pleas had fallen on closed ears. “I am awake at night, thinking if my son is still alive,” Ochirova said. “How can I go on?”",News/World news,‘He felt it was his duty to go’: mother of Russian soldier killed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/coffins-in-buryatia-ukraine-invasion-takes-toll-on-russias-remote-regions
3/30/2022,"Max Mosley killed himself after being told he was suffering from terminal cancer, an inquest has heard. The former F1 boss died aged 81 at his home in London in May 2021. Westminster coroner’s court heard on Tuesday that he decided to take his own life after learning that he likely had a “very limited life expectancy”. He was also said to have been in “debilitating” pain. Evidence presented to the inquest revealed that Mosley told his personal assistant that he had decided to kill himself the night before his death. The court was told he had formed a “settled intent” and could not be dissuaded. Recording a conclusion of suicide, senior coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox said she was “satisfied” Mosley had intended to kill himself. “I am also entirely satisfied Mr Mosley would not have undertaken this action but for the distressing and debilitating terminal lymphoma,” she said. Mosley developed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of blood cancer, in 2019. He was said to have “explored all treatment options”, but by the time of his death had been moved to palliative care. Dr Wilcox recorded the cause of death as a gunshot wound, but added that cancer was a contributing factor. Mosley was born in London in 1940, the youngest son of Oswald Mosley, former leader of the British Union of Fascists, and Diana Mitford. He began his career in motor racing as an amateur driver, and between 1993 and 2009 served as president of Federation Internationale de l’Automobile, the governing body for Formula One. He later became a high-profile campaigner for stricter press controls after the now defunct News of the World wrongly reported he had attended a “Nazi-themed” sex party.

3/30/2022,"Israeli paramedics have said at least five people were killed in a shooting attack in a Tel Aviv suburb, the third such incident in less than a week. Amateur video broadcast on Israeli television stations showed a man dressed in black and pointing an assault rifle walking down a street in Bnei Brak, a Jewish ultra-Orthodox city east of Israel’s commercial capital. The gunman was later identified as a 26-year-old resident of Ya’bad, near Jenin in the northern West Bank. He is believed to have been working at a building site in Bnei Brak and had previously served a short sentence in an Israeli prison for a security offence. The attack caps one of the bloodiest weeks in recent years in Israel, and has stirred fears that Islamic State is attempting to wreak a campaign of violence ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins next weekend. Two earlier attacks in Hadera and Beersheva are believed to have been carried out by the terror group’s sympathisers. Tuesday’s attack was not immediately linked to any organisation. Witnesses said the Bnei Brak gunman began shooting at apartment balconies and then at people on the street and in a car before he was fatally shot. Video footage filmed from nearby shows a black-clad slim man walking into a street with an assault rifle after a bicycle rider made a lucky escape. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said the gunman killed at least five people. “The terrorist was liquidated,” spokesperson Zaki Heller said. He was reportedly shot dead by a police officer. Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas, who is based in the West Bank, issued a rare condemnation of the attacks. “The killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians will only lead to further deterioration of the situation, while we are all striving for stability,” Abbas said in a statement carried by the Wafa news agency. Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett, who heads an ideologically disparate coalition government ranging from Jewish nationalists to Arabs, said the country was “facing a wave of murderous ... terrorism”. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned Tuesday’s “terrorist attack”, calling the recent spate of violence “unacceptable”. The incident followed the conclusion of a summit between Arab foreign ministers from Morocco, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain, as well Blinken, hosted by Israel in the Negev desert. The gathering had raised the ire of Hezbollah in Lebanon, which had called it “treacherous”, and had been staunchly opposed by Islamic factions in Gaza. Tensions have also increased in the West Bank after several deadly clashes between residents and border police. Israeli officials had warned of deteriorating conditions across the West Bank. The annual commemoration of Land Day, marking the deaths of six Israeli Arabs who were killed in 1976 protesting against the planned appropriation of land, is due to be held on Wednesday. Last week’s attack in Beersheba, in which four people were killed in a stabbing and car-ramming rampage, was carried out by an Arab citizen of Israel whom authorities said was an Islamic State sympathiser. On Sunday, as the Arab summit convened in southern Israel, an Arab assailant, a resident of a town in the north of the country, shot and killed two police officers in Hadera, a city about 30 miles north of Tel Aviv. Other officers shot and killed him. Islamic State claimed responsibility for both attacks. The terror group is not known to have a significant presence inside the country. However, the presence of sympathisers who drew inspiration from the group’s leaders had long been a concern.
