4/23/2022,"The vagina is an important part of the female anatomy, but many people know very little about it. ""When we do exams in the office, we get out a mirror, show women their vaginas and point out the anatomy of the area,"" Dr. Lauren Streicher, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and creator of the podcast Dr. Streicher's Inside Information, tells Yahoo Life. ""For the majority of women, this is the first time they take a close look."" Many people, Streicher adds, ""don't know the correct terminology and anatomy"" for describing the area. Dr. Christine Greves, an ob-gyn at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies in Orlando, agrees. ""A lot of women don't know a whole lot about their vaginas,"" she tells Yahoo Life. As Dr. Jennifer Wider, a women's health expert, tells Yahoo Life, ""Whether the fault lies in sex education in the schools, public health messaging, self-reluctance or a combination, not knowing and understanding how the entire body functions and what is normal or abnormal could have health consequences. ""It’s vital to understand our bodies,"" she says, ""even the parts we can’t see all that well."" With that in mind — and in honor of National Vagina Appreciation Day on April 23 — we checked in with some ob-gyns and came back with a few fascinating facts about vaginas. The vagina is sometimes compared to a ""self-cleaning oven,"" as Greves puts it. The bacteria in the vagina include good bacteria called lactobacillus, she says, adding that they work something like a robot vacuum. ""It just takes care of your vagina,"" Greves says. ""If you have the appropriate amount of lactobacillus, it's able to combat the bad bacteria and yeast that could overgrow otherwise."" The vagina also sheds its outermost cells to clean itself, flushing them out in discharges and mucus, Wider says. Horror stories float around online about women ""losing"" tampons in their vagina, but although foreign objects can get stuck in the vagina, losing them isn't possible, Streicher says. ""Everybody thinks the vagina is this open-ended road, but the truth is that it's a dead end,"" she says. ""You can't lose a tampon or anything in there, because it stops at the dead end."" For most women, she says, that's the cervix, the lower part of the uterus, which typically only opens during childbirth. In a hysterectomy, the back of the vagina is sewn closed, ""So it's still a dead end,"" Streicher explains. Ob-gyns say they often hear their patients confusing the two. ""I still have women come into the office and say that their vagina hurts when they mean their vulva,"" Greves says. ""People just use one term for the entire area."" Streicher agrees. ""No one uses the term 'vulva,'"" she says. ""But the vagina is completely internal. Anything you see is the vulva."" Streicher says the reason for this is probably cultural. ""Little girls aren't taught the proper terminology, and no one uses it,"" she says. Most women aren't aware of this, Streicher says, but ""During arousal, there is increased blood flow to the genitalia,"" she explains. ""It also lengthens in order to accommodate a penis — biologically, that's why we have sex."" In general, ""the aroused vagina is longer and a little more dilated than a non-aroused vagina,"" she adds. Despite the frequent use of douches and other feminine deodorizing products, Streicher points out that it's ""normal for a vagina to have a scent."" (The use of douches and deodorant sprays are not recommended by ob-gyns, since they can lead to vaginal infections.) ""It's normal for the vagina to have a light scent,"" Streicher says. However, a strong, foul odor or fishy smell could be the sign of an infection — such as bacterial vaginosis, the most common vaginal infection in women — and should prompt a trip to the doctor, she says. Just like other body parts, every vulva and vagina looks slightly different. ""Many women feel self-conscious about the appearance of their vulva, but they shouldn’t,"" Wider says. ""Vulvae come in all different shapes and sizes. There is a wide range of normal."" Greves agrees, noting that the labia (the folds of skin around the vaginal opening) can be longer in some women and asymmetrical. ""Every one is different,"" she adds.

4/23/2022,"The lone Idaho location of a chain known for toasted submarine sandwiches is now toast itself. Quiznos recently closed at 2250 E. Gowen Road in Boise. The locally owned franchise restaurant at Columbia Village was the last of a disappearing brand that once was ubiquitous not just in the Gem State, but across America. Quiznos sandwiches still have plenty of enthusiasts. Whether it’s the Spicy Monterey or the limited-time Old Bay Lobster Club, the menu gets the juices flowing. Even the Traditional “has it all,” as Quiznos brags on its website, “with Black Angus steak, oven-roasted turkey breast, smoked ham, melted cheddar, fresh lettuce, and tomatoes with creamy ranch dressing, served toasted.” Founded in 1981, Denver-based Quiznos grew into one of the nation’s largest sub slingers by the early 21st century. But a multitude of problems — including stiff competition ranging from Subway to Jimmy John’s — caused an epic downfall during the past 15 years or so. Trade publication Restaurant Business called it “one of the biggest restaurant chain collapses in industry history.” At its peak in 2006, Quiznos had nearly 5,000 locations, Restaurant Business reported. As of May 2021, the publication wrote, that number had dropped to 255. As recently as 2015, there were four Quiznos franchises in the Boise area. Boiseans might remember one closing that year at 1216 N. Orchard St., leaving two in the city, at 8665 W. Franklin Road and 2250 E. Gowen Road, as well as an Eagle store at 664 S. Rivershore Lane. Before that, there was a Quiznos on Overland Road in Boise, in Meridian, even in Kuna. Fat Guys Fresh Deli, a Meridian-based business, plans to take over the former Quiznos space at 2250 E.

4/23/2022,"The prominent former editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a highly popular state-run Chinese media outlet, published a commentary on Saturday urging Chinese citizens to “prepare for a military struggle” in the near future.

The commentary, written by journalist Hu Xijin, came after U.S. senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and six other U.S. officials visited Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, last Thursday. The visit was strongly denounced by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, who warned that China is “firmly opposed to any form of official exchange between the U.S. and Taiwan.”

Hu, who resigned from his post at the end of last year after three decades at the newspaper, remains a vocal and influential state media figure with around 460,000 Twitter followers.

Earlier this month, Hu wrote an article for the Global Times stating that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, which China claims as a part of its territory, would be “the most serious provocation by Washington to China on the Taiwan question since the island's then regional leader Lee Teng-hui visited the US in 1996.”

On Twitter, he simultaneously wrote that Pelosi was “playing with fire” and that “there must be serious consequences for her visit.”
 
 Pelosi is playing with fire, so is the US. There must be serious consequences for her visit. pic.twitter.com/ZmQG1NUyyv 
— Hu Xijin 胡锡进 (@HuXijin_GT) April 7, 2022 


In his most recent comments about the highly tense U.S.-China-Taiwan situation, as reported by Newsweek, Hu asserted that there is a “very high probability” that there will “ultimately” be a “direct military confrontation.” He noted there was a ""sense of crisis"" in Taiwan.

""As the situation in the Taiwan Strait deteriorates, we must prepare for a military struggle,"" Hu wrote.

Regardless of who starts the confrontation, Hu added that any kind of “high-intensity military crisis,” even if not war, would be highly consequential.

As to whether the U.S. would aid Taiwan with military support in the event of a Chinese invasion, Sen. Graham declared on Friday during his meeting with President Tsai Ing-Wen that “every option is on the table.”

Tensions have continued to rise between China and Taiwan since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which triggered heightened speculation about the possibility of China invading Taiwan. The U.S. continues to showcase support for Taiwan by sending high-profile envoys to the island nation’s capital.

4/23/2022,"KHARKIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Victor Gubarev stepped out to buy bread when he was killed by a fragment from a shell that landed in front of his apartment block in Kharkiv on Monday, minutes before his daughter arrived to find an ambulance crew standing over his body. Crew members had to hold Yana Bachek back as they carried her father's body away following the blasts that hit the Soviet-era apartment complex where they live. An English teacher, she said she had been preparing an online lesson in the kitchen of her one-bedroom apartment, close by her parents' flat, when the shelling started. ""I remember just the explosion,"" she said. ""I just returned from shopping and crazy explosions, noise."" Immediately her mother, Lyubov, called, voice trembling, and said her father had gone to buy bread and was still outside. Her partner, Yevgeniy, stopped her from rushing out straight away in case there were follow-up strikes, as there were, seconds later. ""I began to call him and there was no answer,"" she said. When she pulled on her coat and went out a few minutes later, her anguished reaction to the sight of her father's body was caught by photographers who had arrived with the ambulances, shortly after the blasts. ""I am sorry. I want to forget it. The picture. The one picture I saw him,"" Bachek said. Along with the mass graves of Bucha near Kyiv or the destruction of the port city of Mariupol, the indiscriminate shelling of cities like Kharkiv has come to symbolize what the Kremlin has called its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. Russia says its incursion is intended to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext for war. Russia denies targeting civilians and rejects what Ukraine says is evidence of atrocities, saying Ukraine has staged them to undermine peace talks. FAMILY PHOTOS Gubarev's death was one of at least three on Monday in Kharkiv, which has been subjected to near-daily bombardment since Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24. A former driver who started working at the age of 16 and rose to become a vehicle fleet manager for the oil company Gazprom, the 79-year-old had been reluctant to leave because of health problems he and his wife suffered. Sitting in her kitchen, occasionally fighting back tears, Bachek, their only child, shared family photos showing her father with an Elvis-style quiff on holidays by the Black Sea, beaming at Lyubov or swinging his granddaughter playfully in a shopping bag. She described growing up in a middle-class family without a lot of money in late Soviet Ukraine, studying hard at school with her mother, a piano teacher who enjoyed concerts and theatre and her father who liked tinkering with cars and joking around with his daughter. ""In his normal life, even in war, he tried to smile, to joke, to support us. He said to us: 'You are my girls, my heroes',"" she said. Now she waits until her father can be buried but here too the war has imposed an additional agony as the sheer number of dead has grown and normal funerals have become impossible. ""It's not like we used to do - cemetery, grave, a special place where I can be separate from other people, to be calm, to speak, to cry, to put out the Easter cake,"" she said, referring to a Ukrainian memorial custom. While the family waits for news, the loaf of bread Gubarev went out to buy remains, still in its plastic wrapper, on a table in the hallway, where she touches it briefly each time she goes to the door. ""The bread was in blood,"" she said. ""Now I can't keep it in my hands, but I want to because it is a piece of my dad. It was the last thing he had in his hands.""

A group of archaeologists has found evidence of the largest megaquake in human history. A new study featured in Science Advances says that the newly discovered Chile megaquake took place around 3,800 years ago. The quake was so terrible that it led to the abandonment of nearby coastlines for almost 1,000 years. MORE IPHONE COVERAGE: A 4 billion-year-old comet 80 miles wide is headed toward Earth The massive earthquake was caused by a massive rupture that lifted the region’s coastline, the researchers say. It took place in what is now northern Chile. The Chile megaquake did more than just shake the land in the area, though. It also created a massive tsunami with waves as high as 20 meters (66 feet). Researchers believe the tsunami caused by the Chile megaquake traveled all the way to New Zealand. That’s almost 6,000 miles from the point of origin. The tsunami waves were so powerful, they flung coastal boulders the size of cars hundreds of miles inland. This newly discovered earthquake beats the previous record for the largest earthquake recorded. The Valdivia earthquake took place in 1960. At the time, records picked up a massive quake in southern Chile that had a magnitude between 9.4 and 9.6. The Valdivia earthquake killed up to 6,000 people and sent tsunamis out across the Pacific Ocean. For comparison, researchers believe the new Chile megaquake hit with a magnitude of 9.5. The rupture it created was roughly 620 miles long, compared to the 500 miles long rupture made by the Valdivia earthquake. James Goff, a co-author of the new study, and a geologist at the University of Southampton in England says nobody believed an earthquake this size was possible in the northern part of the country. Now, though, Goff says they have evidence that the Chile megaquake took place thousands of years ago. “The Atacama Desert is one of the driest, most hostile environments in the world and finding evidence of tsunamis there has always been difficult,” Goff explains in a statement. “However, we found evidence of marine sediments and a lot of beasties that would have been living quietly in the sea before being thrown inland. And we found all these very high up and a long way inland so it could not have been a storm that put them there.” Coincidentally, just before joining the study, Goff was in New Zealand, on Chatham Island. There, he was studying a vast number of large boulders that appeared to have been thrown hundreds of miles inland. Goff says they determined a Chile megaquake with at least a 9.5 magnitude had moved the boulders. But they had no proof. With these new findings, the researchers have found proof that this mega earthquake did in fact exist. While the Chile megaquake drove the inhabitants away from the coast when it hit over 3,000 years ago, the islands it affected in the South Pacific were uninhabited at that time. Now the islands are popular tourist locations. And a lot of people congregate there. That means that any tsunamis or earthquakes that hit the area could be catastrophic. As such, Goff says he hopes they can learn more from these findings in case something like this ever happens again. Click here to read the full article.

4/23/2022,"A Ukrainian woman described her month hiding in a Mariupol basement during Russia's assault. She said when she finally escaped, she witnessed Russians targeting apartment buildings. The journey to safety took 14 hours and she said she was strip-searched by Russian troops at each of the 16 checkpoints. A Ukrainian woman who escaped Russia's assault on Mariupol said that she witnessed Russian troops targeting apartment buildings ""as if they were playing a computer game."" Alina Beskrovna lived in a basement in Mariupol for a month as Russian troops destroyed her city outside. In a first-person account to UN News, she detailed how she went into hiding the morning of February 24 — the day Russia first invaded Ukraine — and stayed there until March 23. She said people who could not get out within the first few days of the invasion were forced to stay because of active fighting in the streets. ""Those who tried to flee found themselves in a battlefield,"" she said. She described hope during the second week of the war when rumors spread on Telegram that there would be a humanitarian corridor opening up for civilians to go west to Manhush, but it turned out to be a false rumor, she said. Mariupol, a port city on Ukraine's southern coast, has been the scene of intense fighting for almost the entirety of Russia's invasion. The city's mayor told the Associated Press last week that 21,000 people had been killed, and those who have fled described the city as ""hell on earth."" When Beskrovna finally decided to risk her life and flee from her hiding spot beneath the city, she said she witnessed Russian attacks with her own eyes. ""I saw with my own eyes how they aimed at apartment buildings, as if they were playing a computer game,"" she recalled. Beskrovna also said that resources quickly dwindled in the basement during her stay, and with Russia targeting the city's electrical, water, and gas systems, they lost access to those necessities early on. She also said communication was cut off very quickly. She said she does not know if her father is alive as they lost contact weeks ago. ""I knew why it was being done: To leave us completely helpless and hopeless, demoralized, and cut off from the outside world,"" she said. On March 23, she was able to board a train to Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, which took 14 hours. She said Russian troops strip-searched her and other passengers at all 16 checkpoints. While she felt relief when she finally heard the Ukrainian language in Zaporizhzhia, she quickly realized that city wasn't safe either. ""Despite feeling as though I was getting out of this black hole of destruction and death, Zaporizhzhia itself wasn't safe; there were constant air raids,"" she said.

4/23/2022,"A Chinese businessman was charged with torture and sentenced to 20 years in prison by a court in Rwanda after he was filmed beating a local worker who was tied to a pole last year.

— The China Africa Project (@ChinaAfrProject) April 21, 2022 


Sun was arrested after the video circulated online in August 2021. He was later released on bail.

Renzaho Alexis, a Rwandan man who is considered by the court to be an accomplice in the beating, was also sentenced to 12 years in prison.

Judge Jacques Kanyarukiga said that Sun had “tortured the victims and issued corporal punishment with malicious intent, and this is a grave crime.”

While prosecutors accused Sun of assaulting four people, he only admitted to assaulting two workers. He said he beat them because he was “frustrated and fed up of them constantly stealing minerals.”

Witnesses told the court that workers suspected of stealing from Sun were tied and whipped.

Sun, a manager of a mine that produces cassiterite in the Rutsiro district, said that his two victims received compensation of more than 1 million Rwandan francs (approximately $1,000) and a reconciliation letter.

Prosecutors, however, argued that the victims only accepted his payments because “they were traumatized and afraid of him.”

In a statement, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Rwanda wrote, “The Chinese Embassy in Rwanda has taken note of the recent ruling of 20 years’ imprisonment by a Rwandan court regarding a Chinese citizen. The Embassy always asks Chinese citizens in Rwanda to abide by local laws and regulations.”

“Meanwhile, the Embassy calls for the case to be handled appropriately in a rational, fair and just manner, and requests the legitimate rights of Chinese citizens to be properly protected,” the spokesperson added. “The Embassy will continue to follow the case. The Chinese Embassy remains committed to promoting relations between the two countries and friendship between our people.”

Haskins was killed April 9 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when he attempted to cross an interstate and was hit by a dump truck. He was 24. The Florida Highway Patrol said in a crash incident report that Haskins was also struck by a second vehicle.

4/23/2022,"If long waits or slow service suddenly bedevil a favorite restaurant, it may not be the fault of the employees you see — but rather the ones you don't. An acute labor shortage in the restaurant industry has pushed employment in the sector about 1.5 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, restaurant owners don't expect the problem to resolve itself anytime soon. Roughly half of them say recruiting and retention of employees will be their top challenge in 2022, according to a survey released in January by the National Restaurant Association. In a new interview, celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck told Yahoo Finance why restaurant owners have faced such trouble hiring. When the pandemic drove widespread restaurant closures and millions of employees lost their careers or took up other work, many found that they didn't want to return, Puck said. ""A lot of employees in our industry changed their lifestyle,"" said Puck, who co-founded three companies that operate more than 50 restaurants worldwide. ""They said, 'We don't want to work on Mother's Day, on Christmas Eve, or New Year's Eve, Saturday, Sunday.'"" ""A lot of these people didn't want to come back,"" he added. The labor shortage in the restaurant industry has persisted despite a dramatic rise in wages aimed at bringing workers back. Last year, as dining and travel habits returned to some semblance of normal, the high demand for workers in leisure and hospitality made it the only occupation that saw wage increases outpace inflation, as Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported. Hourly wages for those workers jumped 11.8% in March compared to a year ago. The Austrian-born restaurateur lamented the failure to attract employees even with the high pay rate offered at Spago, his chain of high-end restaurants with locations in Beverly Hills, Las Vegas, Maui, and elsewhere. ""We have waiters at Spago that make over $120,000, $150,000,"" he said. ""So it's not a job which doesn't pay well, either."" But there is reason for optimism among restaurant owners. The industry has shown signs of increased hiring in recent months. The leisure and hospitality industry led all sectors in hiring last month by adding 112,000 jobs, with more than half of those jobs coming at food service and drinking places, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The hiring gains owe in part to growth in the industry as it bounces back from the pandemic. The food service industry workforce is expected to increase by 400,000 jobs, for total industry employment of 14.9 million workers by the end of 2022, the National Restaurant Association survey found. ""Little by little, they're coming back,"" Puck says. Max Zahn is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Pressed on whether or not she denied ever advocating for it, she said ""I don't remember."" Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia insisted in court on Friday that she has no recollection of whether she told former President Donald Trump to invoke martial law to remain in power.

Andrew Celli, a lawyer with Free Speech for the People, the group challenging Greene's candidacy, asked her directly whether or not she wanted Trump to remain in power via the imposition of martial law, which includes the temporary suspension of regular laws and the imposition of rule by the military. ""I don't recall,"" Greene responded. Asked whether or not that constituted a denial, the congresswoman held firm. ""I don't remember,"" she said. Following a break, Greene was asked again about whether or not she advocated for the imposition of martial law, and she again said she didn't remember. Greene answered the same way in response to several other questions from her cross-examiners on Friday, claiming she did not recall particular statements including her prior support for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's execution. Though there's no publicly available information that Greene herself advocated for the idea, her refusal to answer is notable. Because she is testifying under oath, she may be found to have committed perjury if she outright denies anything that ultimately ends up being true. Former National Security advisor Michael Flynn previously said that Trump should impose martial law in a Newsmax appearance in late December of 2020, which he also advocated to Trump directly. Under Section 3 of Article 14 of the US Constitution, ""no person"" who's taken an oath and served as a member of Congress ""shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion."" Greene had previously sought to block the hearing from happening, but a federal judge in Georgia ruled on Monday that the challenge could go forward. She is the first member of Congress to testify under oath about the events of January 6.

4/23/2022,"As Russian troops tighten their grip on the strategic port town of Mariupol, their strategy is finally becoming clear. Russian military commander Rustam Minnekaev now says the second phase of President Vladimir Putin’s “special operation” is focused on establishing a “land corridor” from the Donbas all the way to Moldova, which would cut off the rest of Ukraine from the sea. “One of the tasks of the Russian army is to establish full control over the Donbas and southern Ukraine. This will provide a land corridor to the Crimea, as well as influence the vital objects of the Ukrainian economy,” Minnekaev said Friday at a meeting with the Union of Defense Industries, as reported by the Russian state-owned Interfax. “Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are also facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population.” Transnistria is a separatist region of Moldova that has so far not been officially involved in the war despite hosting a Russian military base since the 1990s. The general’s words suggest that Moldova’s sovereign borders would also come under threat from further Russian expansion. Phony efforts to protect Russian-speaking peoples have often foreshadowed Putin’s imperial invasions. In reality, Russian speakers have been struck down in the hundreds in eastern Ukraine during the brutal invasion. If successful, the strategy would include taking the port of the former seaside resort town of Odesa near the Moldovan border, which has suffered sporadic bombardments but no full-fledged invasion so far. Russia’s warship Moskva was hit about 75 miles off the coast of Odesa two weeks ago, before it sank en route to Crimea. The refocusing of troops from northern Ukraine to the southern regions of the country has further choked Mariupol, where Ukrainian troops and civilians are holed up in a steel factory surrounded by Russian troops. Satellite imagery identified a growing number of graves outside the port city, where Ukrainian officials say up to 200 new graves have been dug since April 3. While the Russian military has largely now left northern Ukraine alone save for sporadic missile strikes, fresh evidence of Russia’s ruthless tactics there in recent weeks continue to build a case for widespread war crimes. Andrii Nebytov, the head of police for Kyiv region, told CNN that they are examining 1,084 bodies found in the region outside Kyiv, including Bucha, for signs of torture. “These are civilians who had nothing to do with territorial defense or other military formations,” he said. “The vast majority—between 50 percent and 75 percent—are people killed by small arms, either a machine gun or a sniper rifle, depending on the location.” Among the atrocities are evidence of widespread rape and sexual mutilation. The youngest victim who survived to tell her story is just 15, according to CNN. Several female bodies in mass graves show evidence of horrific crimes as well. On Friday, the United Nations Human Rights Office described Russian atrocities against Ukrainians as a “horror story of violations against civilians” that shows no sign of abating.

4/23/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan describes four islands whose ownership it disputes with Moscow as “illegally occupied by Russia” in the latest version of a diplomatic report released Friday, using stronger language to describe the territorial flap than other recent versions and underscoring the chilled relations between the two sides amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The description in the 2022 Diplomatic Bluebook, an annual report on Japan's foreign policy issued by the Foreign Ministry, uses that phrasing for the first time in nearly two decades. Japan, which is struggling to improve ties with Moscow to regain control of the Kurils, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, had previously described the dispute in a softer tone. “The Northern Territories are a group of islands Japan has sovereignty over and an integral part of Japan’s territory, but currently they are illegally occupied by Russia,” the ministry said in the report. The dispute over the Russian-held islands, which the former Soviet Union seized from Japan at the end of World War II, has prevented the two countries from signing a peace treaty formally ending their war hostilities. The report last used a similar expression in 2003 but had toned down its phrasing until last year, when it described the dispute as “the greatest concern between Japan and Russia” and noted that “Japan has sovereignty” over the islands. In another territorial dispute, the ministry said the island that Japan calls Takeshima is “illegally occupied” by Seoul, which calls it Dokdo. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry protested Japan’s “repeated inclusion of unjust sovereignty claims over Dokdo,” calling the island an integral part of South Korean territory. It said Tokyo’s repeated claims are in “no way conducive to efforts to establish a future-oriented relationship between the two sides. Japan-South Korea ties have been also badly strained by historical issues. Japan has joined other Group of Seven countries in imposing a series of sanctions against Russia. Tokyo is taking a greater role in the international effort against Russia because of its concerns about the impact of the invasion in East Asia, where China’s military has grown increasingly assertive. Japan has already faced reprisals from Russia, which recently announced the suspension of talks on a peace treaty with Tokyo that included negotiations over the disputed islands. Japan also seeks to bolster its defense capability and budget as part of a key revision to Japan’s national security strategy expected later this year. ___ AP writer Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,Japan says disputed islands 'illegally occupied by Russia',https://news.yahoo.com/japan-says-disputed-islands-illegally-111711150.html
4/23/2022,"The Walt Disney Co. has been silent this past week over the Florida Legislature's action to repeal the Reedy Creek Improvement District. That's the governing structure for Disney's Orlando-area properties. That silence leaves much unknown about how Disney will respond, and what its next steps will be. Under the legislation, the move would take effect in June 2023. The Legislature's action came in response to Disney criticism over the “Parental Rights in Education Act"" that Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law in March. The measure — which critics term the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill — includes provisions that limit instruction about gender identity and sexual orientation in grades K-3. A smaller world for Disney?: Florida lawmakers revoke special self-governing status Check your air fryer: Best Buy recalls some Insignia air fryer models because they can overheat and catch fire The company responded to the fallout from Disney employees and stockholders — both in an open letter to employees and during the company's annual stockholders' meeting. DeSantis and lawmakers took notice. Here's what we know about what transpired: Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek has taken criticism in recent months from some employees and shareholders over what his critics felt was Disney's muted response in opposing the Parental Rights in Education Act. Chapek last month sent a message addressed to Disney employees — ""but especially our LGBTQ+ community"" — about the legislation. ""Speaking to you, reading your messages and meeting with you have helped me better understand how painful our silence was,"" Chapek said. ""It is clear that this is not just an issue about a bill in Florida, but instead yet another challenge to basic human rights. You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights, and I let you down. I am sorry. We need to use our influence to promote that good by telling inclusive stories, but also by standing up for the rights of all."" Chapek read a statement at the company's annual stockholders' meeting explaining that tactic. ""We were opposed to the bill from the outset, but we chose not to take a public position on it, because we thought we could be more effective working behind the scenes, engaging directly with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle,"" Chapek told stockholders. ""And we were hopeful that our long-standing relationships with those lawmakers would enable us to achieve a better outcome. But despite weeks of effort, we were ultimately unsuccessful. Certainly, the outcome in Florida was not what many of us were hoping for, especially our LGBTQ+ employees."" Some stockholders on both sides of the issue were not pleased with the company's efforts — and expressed those views during the shareholder question-and-answer portion of the meeting. One stockholder questioned why Chapek and a group of LGBTQ+ employees were planning to meet with DeSantis, when the governor's views were clear on the legislation. Another read into the meeting record comments from his daughter — a Disney employee — who felt the company did not do enough to fight the legislation; should not have donated to politicians who supported the bill; and does not have enough of an LGBTQ+ representation in its mainstream Disney shows and movies. She termed Disney's initial efforts on the legislation ""beyond disappointing."" In contrast, another stockholder complained to Chapek that ""your recent Magical Pride Days and your upcoming LGBTQ Pride March this year is a blatant attempt at indoctrinating children and attendees towards a certain political ideology."" He also expressed concern that transgender themes are getting into Disney creative content. ""My question to you today is: Would it not be beneficial both to you and the millions of Disney lovers around the world to ditch the politicization and gender ideology from your content aimed at children, and instead try to win back the trust of families by sliding away from politics altogether? And reverting back to the magic and innocence that has been the founding motive for its success?"" ""I think all the participants in today's call can see how difficult it is to try to thread the needle between the extreme polarization of political viewpoints we have as shareholders,"" he told shareholders. ""Certainly, our shareholders follow the general distribution of our audience in general and America and the globe, in terms of having different points of view."" Chapek has announced a multifaceted approach to addressing the issues. Among its efforts, Disney is taking action to combat the spread of legislation like the Parental Rights in Education Act approved by the Florida Legislature and signed into law by DeSantis. Chapek said Disney is: Increasing its support for advocacy groups to combat similar legislation in other states, including signing the Human Rights Campaign's statement opposing such legislative efforts. Pledging $5 million to organizations working to protect LGBTQ+ rights. Working to create ""a new framework for our political giving that will ensure our advocacy better reflects our values."" Halting political donations in Florida, pending this review. Chapek said Disney likes ""to celebrate those different points of view, but, really, what we want Disney to be is a place where people can come together and place their differences aside, and it's my goal to make sure that that continues to be the case, where Disney is a unifying force, not a divisive force. My opinion is that when someone walks down Main Street and comes in the gates of our parks, they put their differences aside, and they look at what they have as a shared belief — a shared belief of Disney magic, hopes, dreams and imagination and bringing people together."" ""We stand with our LGBTQ+ community going forward, and will continue to make an impact,"" Chapek said at the shareholder meeting. ""I truly believe we are an infinitely better and stronger company because of our LGBTQ+ community."" Chapek told employees in his email. ""I missed the mark in this case, but am an ally you can count on — and I will be an outspoken champion for the protections, visibility and opportunity you deserve.""

4/23/2022,"A South Carolina man who traveled to Alabama in March to claim responsibility for the death of a missing woman has been charged with her murder. Brian Edward Jones, 62, was formally charged with murder after calling the Bessemer Police Department to confess to his girlfriend’s 2001 murder, according to AL.com. Jones said he killed Janet Jones Luxford, 41, who left her Jacksonville, Florida, home for Alabama shortly before she vanished two decades ago. Luxford was never seen again. “We were in disbelief that somebody had come to us to confess to a murder, much less one that is 21 years old,” said Bessemer Police Lt. Christian Clemons. In March, Jones boarded a bus in South Carolina with the sole purpose of getting the murder off his chest. Once in Alabama, he called authorities to confess that he accidentally killed Luxford and stuffed her body in a suitcase. Lt. Clemons told Birmingham’s WBRC that Jones “sat outside of our station until he finally got up the nerve to give us a call.” Officers were stunned; they hadn’t before heard of Janet Luxford, who was reported missing on Sept. 22, 2002, by her daughter in Napa, California, according to the Doe Network. “It’s not a homicide that we even had on our radar,” Clemons told WBRC. “It’s something that he committed here 21 years ago, and nobody knew that it happened besides him.” On March 29, two days after the shocking confession, Jones led authorities to the area of Harmer Street and Valley Creek, where they discovered a green suitcase containing human skeletal remains, according to AL.com. The Jefferson County Coroner’s Office has yet to make a positive identification. “Although the remains found have not been officially identified, Jones is being charged with the death of Janet Luxford,” police told Birmingham’s WVTM. “The Jefferson County Coroner’s Office is actively searching medical records and using DNA to help identify the remains, but the process could take as long as nine months.” Janet Luxford was last seen in September 2001 after leaving her Ernest Street residence in Jacksonville, as reported by her daughter in 2002. Witnesses later saw the missing woman leaving a Bessemer motel with an unidentified truck driver.  Brian Edward Jones  Photo: Jefferson County Sheriff's Office  Lt. Clemons told WBRC that Luxford relocated from Florida to Alabama to be with Jones. Jones admitted to police that he was the unidentified man who was with Luxford before her death on Feb. 18, 2001 according to AL.com. He remembered the date because it was the same day NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt died during the Daytona 500 race. According to his confession, Jones said he and Luxford got into an altercation at a motel in the 1100 block of 9th Avenue Southwest in Bessemer when he struck Luxford with a golf club, unintentionally killing her. “So 21 years ago, Mr. Jones was here working as a day laborer,” Clemons told WBRC. “He and Ms. Luxford were boyfriend-girlfriend. She wanted to get money to go back home, which is California, to see her folks and from that, an argument started, to which he described got out of hand, and he ended up hitting her with a club in the throat.” Online records show Jones was booked into the Jefferson County Jail on March 29 on charges of murder and abuse of a corpse. His bail is set at $765,000. Authorities withheld news of Jones’ arrest until they could notify Janet Luxford’s family, which they had on Tuesday, according to AL.com. Jones said he thought about confessing in the past. “He said he thought several times about coming forward but did not want to disappoint his parents,” said Clemons. “He seemed enormously remorseful, and appeared to be someone who had been carrying weight of this around for a long time and was relieved to have it over.” Lt. Clemons, who referred to Jones’ confession as a “once-in-a-career type case,” told AL.com that the defendant admitted to the murder because he was concerned for Luxford’s “eternal destination.” Jail records don’t indicate when Jones is expected to appear in court.",U.S./Oxygen,"Man Confesses To Killing Woman 20 Years Ago, Leads Police To Her Body In Suitcase",https://news.yahoo.com/man-confesses-killing-woman-20-222647751.html
4/23/2022,"LONDON — The first shipments of the Biden administration’s $800 million military aid package have arrived in Ukraine. Included among the first round of weapons are 18 155 mm howitzers, in addition to another 72 cannons that were announced this week. The howitzers heading to Ukraine will have a “significant” impact on Ukrainian firepower, according to a senior U.S. defense official, as the war with Russia enters its third month. A howitzer is a short cannon, placed at a steep angle of descent, used to fire at relatively high trajectories. The cannons can fire up to four rounds per minute, according to the U.S. Army. The weapons can be traced back to the 15th century when similar models were used by the Czechs and were known as “houfnice” cannons. Since World War I, the word “howitzer” has been used to describe these weapons. The Department of Defense confirmed that 18 155 mm howitzers would be sent to Ukraine as part of the $800 million in military aid. In a second $800 million military aid package, announced by Biden on Thursday, an additional 72 howitzers, 72 tactical vehicles to tow the cannons and 144,000 rounds will be sent to Ukraine. The weapons are from U.S. Army and Marine Corps stocks. A senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Wednesday that howitzer rounds, ammunition for the cannons, arrived in Europe on Tuesday to be sent to Ukraine. The official added that more were arriving on Wednesday and in the “coming days.” Training of Ukrainian soldiers on how to use the howitzers — expected to last about a week — “has begun,” a defense official said this week. The official declined to say where the training was taking place, but said it was not in Ukraine. “This is training the trainers,” the official told the Washington Examiner. “It’s a smallish number of Ukrainians, a little bit more than 50.” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told the Military Times on April 14 that there were no more plans to deploy U.S. troops to handle the training and instead, the trainees will return home to train other soldiers. The U.S. sent howitzers after Ukrainian officials asked for artillery. It is believed the cannons will play a significant role in Russia’s new battle for the Donbas region, which consists of flat, rolling plains, a defense official told Stars and Stripes. “We knew from talking to Ukrainians that artillery was going to be a critical need because of the way the terrain lays,” the official said. “And so we saw early on the Russians were moving artillery [for the battle in the Donbas].” Meanwhile, the Pentagon spokesman reiterated on Thursday that sending the assistance has been in full “consultation” with Ukraine, and that the weapons sent by the U.S. “provide enough artillery now to equip five battalions for Ukraine for potential use in the Donbas.” “I want to stress again that what we’re providing is done in full consultation with the Ukrainians and that they believe that these systems will be helpful to them in the fight,” Kirby said. “Where and when they employ them and how they employ them is, of course, up to them.” _____",World/Yahoo News,What are howitzers?

4/23/2022,"The airplane passenger Mike Tyson punched Wednesday night has a long criminal record, according to court records. Melvin Townsend III of Punta Gorda, Florida was listed in 2019 as having “habitual felony offender status,’’ when he was sentenced to 25 months for grand theft, according to court records with the Clerk of Circuit Court in Charlotte County, Florida. Townsend, 36, also has been convicted of fraud by identity theft, trafficking in property known to be stolen, use or possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of a controlled substance without a prescription, court records show. The conviction of grand theft property of more than $300 but less than $5,000 stemmed from an incident in which Townsend stole a trailer by hitching it to his truck and later told police, “I am sorry for everything and I was going to return the records,’’ according to court records. Video footage published Thursday by TMZ showed Tyson, the 55-year-old former champion boxer, punching Townsend on a Jet Blue flight at San Francisco International Airport bound for Miami after Townsend apparently badgered Tyson. ""Unfortunately, Mr. Tyson had an incident on a flight with an aggressive passenger who began harassing him and threw a water bottle at him while he was in his seat,"" a spokesperson representing Tyson told USA TODAY Sports.

4/23/2022,"A Ukrainian military official said Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov's troops killed three Russian soldiers who rioted. Kadyrov's militia has a reputation for brutality and is reported to be fighting in Ukraine. Insider was unable to verify the claim, though it is one of numerous similar reports on low Russian morale. A Ukrainian official said that troops working for Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen Republic leader and ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, killed three Russian soldiers who did not want to fight in the Ukraine war. A number of Russian soldiers had rioted over a lack of promised pay in Polohy, a district in the southeastern Ukrainian region of Zaporizhzhia, according to an official statement attributed to regional military spokesperson Col. Ivan Arefyev. The statement, posted to Telegram on Wednesday, said that Ukrainian intelligence found that the soldiers in question ""were ready to surrender their weapons and go home."" But fighters answering to Kadyrov ""brutally killed"" three of the Russian soldiers, Arefyev's statement said. Insider has been unable to verify the incident, and did not immediately receive a response to enquiries to the Russian embassy in London and Chechnya's parliament. Kadyrov is a Putin loyalist who runs the quasi-autonomous region of Chechnya with an iron fist. His private militia — ""Kadyrovites"" as per the statement — are widely reported to have been fighting in support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Arefyev's report, if verified, would give a rare insight into the relationship between Kadyrov's forces and the Russian rank and file in this conflict. Kadyrov's troops have a reputation for ferocity that is frequently leveraged in Kremlin propaganda, according to the New Lines Institute think tank. Arefyev's statement follows a string of reports that a proportion of Russian soldiers are suffering low morale and reluctant to carry out Putin's military objectives in Ukraine. Some such reports originate with Ukrainian officials and are amplified as part of the country's war effort, and not all have been independently verified. Ukraine's Security Service on Wednesday tweeted audio purporting to be intercepted telephone conversations between frustrated Russian soldiers. In the audio, the voices suggest shooting a former colonel. They said they were left in a precarious situation with no weapons or supplies, and that they had been ordered to fire on civilians. ""We were like what the fuck, you know?"" says one voice. ""Fucking bastards … shoot that wanker first, right now, motherfucker,"" said another, in apparent reference to the colonel. The other can be heard agreeing, saying he would write ""a massive report"" when he got home. As with the report from Arefyev, Insider was unable to verify the authenticity of the recording. But others have emerged from independent sources. On March 23, the Ukrainian journalist Roman Tsymbaliuk reported that frustrated members of a Russian battalion ran over their colonel's legs in a tank, hospitalizing them. A senior Western official later told The Washington Post that they believed the colonel had been killed ""as a consequence of the scale of the losses taken by his own brigade."" In early April, lawyer Mikhail Benyash told the Financial Times that more than 1,000 Russian service members had contacted him after he agreed to represent three Russian national guardsmen who refused to fight in Ukraine. The Russian newspaper Pskovskaya Gubernia also reported on April 7 that 60 Russian paratroopers had refused to join the invasion. The paper has a reputation for independence within Russia's repressive media environment.

4/23/2022,"PHOENIX (AP) — The Arizona Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the state's voters do not have the right to reject a massive income tax cut approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Doug Ducey last year. The decision means a tax cut is in effect that will hit nearly $2 billion when it is fully in place and mainly benefits the wealthy. The high court overturned a lower court judge who ruled in favor of education advocates who collected enough signatures under the state's referendum law to block them from taking effect until voters could weigh in in November. Lawyers for the Arizona Free Enterprise Club, a conservative pro-business group that pushes for lower taxes and regulations, argued the state constitution does not allow referrals for measures that provide for the “support and maintenance” of state government and that the tax cut bill falls into that category. The Supreme Court agreed in a brief order issued just two days after it heard arguments in the case. The order signed by Chief Justice Robert Brutinel does not explain the court's reasoning, saying a full opinion will be released later. The lower court judge had said that the constitutional provision only blocked referendums on bills that appropriate money, and since the tax cut bill does not do that, it is subject to voter review. Ducey, a Republican who pushed for an expansion of the court in 2016 that has allowed him to appoint six of the seven justices, hailed the decision. “This ruling is another big win for our state’s taxpayers and it couldn’t have come at a better time,” he said in a statement. “With inflation hitting Arizonans hard, this decision ultimately means more of their hard-earned dollars can stay in their wallets.” Most residents won't see much help, because the vast majority of the tax cuts go to the wealthy. The Legislature's budget analysts said the average Arizonan earning between $75,000 and $100,000 will save $231 a year in state income taxes. Meanwhile, the average taxpayer earning between $500,000 and $1 million a year will save more than $12,000, according to the Legislature’s budget analysts. The coalition of progressive groups that backed the referendum slammed the Supreme Court for “stripping the rights of everyday Arizonans, in an attempt to protect the rich.” ""The ballot was Arizona’s last line of defense from the Ducey-packed Supreme Court – today that defense has fallen,"" said the statement from two groups backing Invest in Arizona. “Despite the explicit and strong language of the Arizona Constitution granting the people a co-equal right to legislate, they have been shut out."" The Arizona Center for Economic Progress and the Children's Action Alliance said voters have repeatedly backed measures that boosted school funding, child care and other progressive causes, only to have them blocked by the high court or erased by the Legislature. Earlier this year, a Supreme Court decision led to the demise of a tax on the wealthy designed to fund schools that voters approved in 2020. That came after lawmakers passed a law during last year's session that would have cut the expected $900 million in funding by more than half. Free Enterprise Club President Scot Mussi called the Supreme Court ruling a “big win for taxpayers.” ""Invest in Arizona and out-of-state special interest groups need to accept this reality and stop making a farce of the referendum process,” Mussi said in a series of tweets. Arizona's constitution lets voters block newly enacted laws by collecting signatures from 5% of qualified voters. If they do, the law is put on hold until the next general election. Lawmakers at the Capitol were split along party lines, just as they were last year when majority Republicans who hold bare majorities in the House and Senate enacted the tax cuts with no Democratic support. House Majority Leader Rep. Ben Toma said the decision provides clarity and certainty, and means tax historic relief is not in effect. Sen. Rebecca Rios, who leads minority Democrats in her chamber, said she was “disappointed to say the least.” “A true Democracy should have no problem allowing this to go before the voters of Arizona,” Rios said in a statement. “Republicans continue to attack our schools, teachers and students, despite a majority of Arizonans making it clear time and time again that they want meaningful investments in our public schools.” Republicans were planning on getting around the referendum by repealing the tax cuts and enacting larger ones, but that will no longer be necessary. Under the new law, rates for most taxpayers would drop to a flat 2.5%, and revenue would be cut by $1.9 billion once the tax cuts are fully in place. That’s down from a range of 2.59% to 4.5%.

4/23/2022,"A man, 35, was set to be released after 15 years of wrongful imprisonment Friday but a Wayne County judge delayed the exoneration because she was approached by a Detroit officer who claims to have further information. In a hearing Friday, Terance Calhoun was moments from being cleared of his supposed crimes and having his 2007 case dismissed when Judge Kelly Ramsey said the hearing had to be adjourned. She said she was approached by Detroit Police Officer Robert Kane, who had a binder of information that he believed to be relevant to the case and the release of Calhoun. Kane testified at Calhoun's preliminary examination in November 2006. In 2007, Calhoun was charged with multiple crimes in two separate cases involving the rape of a 13-year-old girl and attempted sexual assault of another girl, 15, to which he pleaded no contest. He was sentenced to a minimum of 17 years. A rediscovered rape kit excluded him from being the perpetrator. This evidence discovered by officials led the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office's Conviction Integrity Unit to ask a judge Friday afternoon to dismiss the case and clear Calhoun of the convictions. But the request will now be delayed pending a review of the materials. ""It is my belief that it is my role and responsibility to ensure the court's role is to ensure that justice is done and the court is also mindful of the need to ensure finality in its orders,"" Ramsey said during the hearing. ""Given the circumstances before this court, there needs to be an opportunity, due diligence that exceeds whatever happened this morning to whenever Mr. Kane hopefully went to the prosecutor's office."" Ramsey said Kane met her in her courtroom Friday morning and he presented her with a binder and said: ""Judge, you've got to look at this before you dismiss this case, you have to look at this evidence here."" Ramsey said she referred him to the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office and did not review any of the documents he brought to her. More: Oakland County lawyers charged in debt-collection scheme face lawsuit from those they sued More: US Supreme Court rejects Kalamazoo murderer's argument to be freed ""I just want to acknowledge how hard this has been, Mr. Calhoun, and I certainly do not want to continue this, but this is the decision of this court today,"" Ramsey said. ""I don't know what Robert Kane has to share, but I certainly think that it's worth commenting that an officer came here this morning and wanted to show me something. I don't know the solidity of that information. But what I do think is that whether or not this information that the officer may or may not have cannot be disregarded to ensure that we arrive at an accurate conclusion."" Both the prosecutor's office, represented by Valerie Newman, director of the Conviction Integrity Unit, and Calhoun's attorney Michael Mittlestat, assistant defender with the State Appellate Defender Office, expressed their disbelief toward the situation. Newman said the move was highly inappropriate for the Detroit Police Department to go behind the prosecutor's back and straight to the judge. ""I just want to apologize to Mr. Calhoun and his family who traveled in from out of state to be here today to assist him and to all the defense attorneys because it just happened this morning,"" Newman said. ""I had been diligently trying to deal with this by contacting the Detroit Police Department chief himself because this is so highly inappropriate. It has never happened before. And to me, I just have to say it is absolutely outrageous conduct on behalf of this police officer."" In 2007, Calhoun was sentenced to first-degree criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping, felony firearms and attempted kidnapping. He could be eligible to $50,000 from the state for every year spent in prison based on a wrongful conviction. Mittlestat said Calhoun's family was absolutely devastated and some traveled in from Tenessee to see him walk free out of the Woodland Correctional Facility. The defense and county prosecutor hold to the fact that the conviction should be vacated, he said. ""The bottom line is is we have a DNA exoneration here,"" Mittlestat said, adding that he believes the binder from Kane will not present any new information on the case. The hearing ended with Ramsey apologizing to Calhoun and suggesting Wednesday at 1 p.m. as the next date for another hearing. Contact Miriam Marini: mmarini@freepress.com.

4/23/2022,"Former President Donald Trump mused about embracing being portrayed as a dictator. Trump made the remarks at the Ritz-Carlton on Amelia Island, Fla. on Thursday night. ""Which would you rather be, a dumb person or a dictator? Perhaps a dictator would be better,"" he said. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday joked about being depicted as ""a dictator"" by the press, which he assumed was the result of the cognitive test he has repeatedly bragged about passing in 2018. ""Which would you rather be, a dumb person or a dictator?"" Trump said Thursday night at the Heritage Foundation's annual leadership conference in Florida at the Ritz-Carlton resort on Amelia Island. ""Perhaps a dictator would be better,"" he continued. ""I don't want to be a dumb person."" —Acyn (@Acyn) April 21, 2022 In the same speech, Trump said he was surprised nobody ever found out that he told the president of a NATO country in a closed door meeting that the US would not come to their protection if they didn't increase their defense spending. Experts on authoritarianism have warned that Trump not only frequently praises strongmen dictators on the world stage, but also exhibits authoritarian tendencies of his own, culminating in the January 6 insurrection on Capitol Hill. In the former president's assessment, the dictator chatter only began because he did so well on a cognitive test he took in 2018. ""First they said, 'Not too smart,'"" Trump said earlier in his speech. ""Well that all went away, and I said, 'Doc Ronny [Jackson], I gotta take a test.' He said, ""You know the problem is, sir, this is essentially a public place.' One of the great hospitals of the world, right? You have a series of doctors sitting there and all, and if you do badly, the word's gonna get out ... And I did it in front of a panel, and we aced it. And the one person said, 'That's the first time I've ever seen anyone ace it.' So all of that stuff stopped ... but then they made me a dictator instead."" The test Trump took is called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, designed to detect signs of dementia. It was also the source of his viral ""person, woman, man, camera, TV"" remarks from July 2020.

4/23/2022,"By Dawit Endeshaw ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The queues formed early each morning outside the Russian embassy in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. Drawn by rumours on social media, young men and old, many with their military records in hand, arrived with hopes of fighting for Russia in Ukraine. What began as a trickle of volunteers swelled over two weeks to scores, two neighbourhood residents told Reuters. On Tuesday, Reuters reporters saw several hundred men registering with Ethiopian security guards outside the embassy. The guards recorded their names and asked for proof of military service. There is no evidence that any Ethiopians have been sent to Ukraine, nor is it clear if any ever will be. A man who came out of the embassy and addressed the volunteers in Russian through an interpreter said Russia had enough forces for now, but that they would be contacted when they were needed. The Russian embassy did not respond to questions from Reuters about the man's identity or whether Russia was deploying Ethiopian volunteers to Ukraine. It issued a statement later on Tuesday saying that it was not recruiting fighters, and that the Ethiopians who showed up outside were well-wishers expressing ""solidarity and support for the Russian Federation"". The Ethiopian foreign ministry welcomed the Russian statement for what it called ""refuting the unfounded reports of recruitment for the Russian Armed Forces"" but did not respond to Reuters questions. Neither did the Russian foreign ministry. Ukraine's embassy in Addis Ababa referred questions to the Ethiopian authorities. Ethiopia has called on all sides in the war to exercise restraint and did not vote on a UN General Assembly resolution condemning the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine which Russia calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise the country. But many in Ethiopia have voiced solidarity with Russia, which has enjoyed close relations with the Horn of Africa nation since the Soviet era. Social media rumours of a $2,000 payment to join up and the possibility of work in Russia after the war tantalised some of the men in the queues. Many parts of Ethiopia are riven by conflict and annual inflation hovers around 30%. ""I am willing to support the Russia government and, in return, once I get out, I will get benefits,"" Leta Kibru told Reuters outside the embassy, where he returned on Tuesday to check on what he said was his application. ""Living in Ethiopia is becoming difficult,"" said the 30-year-old street vendor, who said he had retired from the Ethiopian army in 2018 and now sells clothing and mobile phones. ""What I need is to live in Europe."" Leta said he had heard about a $2,000 payout from friends who had registered before him. Two others in the queues this week said they had seen posts on Facebook saying the embassy was signing up recruits. Reuters was not able to find any posts on the subject from official sources or confirm any such offer. The rumours followed news reports in March that Russian President Vladimir Putin had given the green light for up to 16,000 volunteers from the Middle East to be deployed alongside Russian-backed rebels to fight in Ukraine, although Reuters has not been able to confirm that any have been sent there. ""The reason I want to go to Russia is not to fight Ukraine but it is because I am not benefiting from my country,"" said Binyam Woldetsadik, a 40-year-old security guard who said he served in Ethiopia's 1998-2000 border war with Eritrea. ""I'd rather be a national of a different country."" By late Wednesday morning, when Binyam showed up, the number of volunteers outside the Russian embassy had dwindled to around 20. A guard told him the embassy was no longer accepting registrations, he said.
