2/23/2022,"Newcastle’s director of rugby, Dean Richards, has been issued with a misconduct charge for criticising referee Christophe Ridley after Sunday’s 15-14 Gallagher Premiership defeat by Exeter. The Falcons back row, Callum Chick, was shown a red card for a high tackle midway through the first half of a game that was decided by Joe Simmonds’ late penalty. Richards believed the sending-off was a hasty call by Ridley, claiming: “We’ve reached a moment in rugby where officials are making quick decisions rather than the correct decision.”  The former England No 8 has been charged with conduct prejudicial to the interests of the union and the game and will face an independent disciplinary panel on Wednesday evening. A Rugby Football Union statement said that Richards’ comments “undermined the authority and questioned the integrity of the match official”. Chick was due to face his own hearing over the red card offence on Tuesday evening. The charge laid against Richards comes amid a clampdown on behaviour towards officials by the game’s governing bodies. In November, following World Rugby’s two-month ban for Rassie Erasmus after his rant during the Lions tour last summer, the injured Bath and England wing Anthony Watson was handed a suspended one-match ban for criticising a referee’s decision on social media. During Watson’s hearing, the panel heard from the Rugby Football Referees’ Union which outlined the acute shortage of match officials at grassroots level following the pandemic-enforced layoff exacerbated by “many of our members leaving the game having become disillusioned with, amongst other things, persistent challenging of their decisions.” This week will also see a potentially seismic day in the future of the Championship which underpins the domestic top flight in the Premiership. The RFU council is due to meet to discuss the future structure of the competition, with proposals being considered that would include Premiership reserve sides in a new-look league. Ealing Trailfinders and Doncaster Rovers are also poised to discover if their grounds will be deemed suitable to make them eligible for promotion to the Premiership.",Sport/Sport,Newcastle’s Dean Richards faces charge over referee comments,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/22/newcastles-dean-richards-faces-charge-over-referee-comments
2/23/2022,"Truth hurts, everyone knows that. Nevertheless, I wasn’t expecting my experience with Truth Social, Donald Trump’s new social media venture, to be quite so painful. After months of fanfare, the former president’s new app, which is essentially a Twitter clone, was opened to the US public on Sunday night. Obviously, I signed up straight away – or at least I tried to.  I spent 20 frustrating minutes attempting to create a new account and getting error message after error message. Eventually, I managed to sign up with the username @stormyd, only to be told that I had been put on a waiting list “due to massive demand”. I was number 194,276 in line, apparently. Which, I’m sure, is a very precise number and not something they just pulled out of the air. It is unclear how many people were actually successful at getting on Truth Social – although the Guardian has reported that at least one Catholic priest managed to join. The fact that you, apparently, needed God on your side to secure an account wasn’t the only issue with the launch: the app has also run into potential legal trouble. Turns out, Truth Social may not have just taken inspiration from Twitter, the app’s logo looks suspiciously like that of a British solar power startup called TRAILAR. “Great to see Donald Trump supporting a growing sustainability business!” TRAILAR tweeted on Monday. “Maybe ask next time?” If Trump’s new app failed to successfully launch on time, it would hardly be the surprise of the century. The last time he made a lot of noise about launching a new media platform, it turned out to be an underwhelming blog, which shuttered after just a few weeks. It’s not as if Trump put a technological genius in charge of Truth Social: Devin Nunes, head honcho at the app’s parent company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), may be most famous for the fact that he once unsuccessfully sued a cow. In 2019, Nunes, who used to be a Republican congressman, filed a $250m lawsuit against Twitter and two parody Twitter accounts: one was called “Devin Nunes’ Mom” and one was called “Devin Nunes’ Cow”. This is no laughing matter, I’ll have you know. The cow was very mean to him: it called the politician a “treasonous cowpoke” whose “boots are full of manure”. It was all very hard for the poor man, whose lawsuit claimed that the parody accounts subjected him to a “defamation campaign of stunning breadth and scope, one that no human being should ever have to bear and suffer in their whole life”. Nunes doesn’t just have beef with cows, by the way. He’s a big fan of suing anyone who says anything mean to him, and has launched defamation lawsuits against a number of journalists. He managed to juggle all these lawsuits with his political career for a while but, in December, announced he was leaving Congress to join TMTG. “The time has come to reopen the internet and allow for the free flow of ideas and expression without censorship,” he proclaimed. Unless cows are involved, obviously. No free speech or free flow of ideas for cows! Or pesky journalists. Or anyone who says anything unflattering, if we’re being honest. Truth Social’s marketing material talks about welcoming diverse opinions but the app’s terms and conditions are rather more restrictive. Under “prohibited activities”, the rules state that users of the site agree not to “disparage, tarnish, or otherwise harm, in our opinion, us and/or the Site”. A cynic might wonder whether the fact that you are not allowed to say mean things about Trump on his app may factor in why Melania doesn’t appear to be a big fan of her husband’s latest venture. A couple of weeks ago, you see, the former first lady entered into a “special arrangement” to share “exclusive communications” with the conservative social media app Parler. Why would she announce an exclusive relationship with a direct competitor to Trump’s app shortly before the latter launched? I’m not even going to begin to speculate. The truth is out there, but there’s a very long waiting list to get to it. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Fake news alert!

2/23/2022,"All three of the largest groups in the European parliament are demanding that the EU assess whether Switzerland should be categorised as a high-risk country for money laundering and financial crime, as reaction to the Credit Suisse leak continues to reverberate about the world. Less than 48 hours after the Guardian and other media published an investigation into the leak as part of the Suisse secrets project, political groups representing the majority of MEPs in the European parliament support the possible blacklisting of Switzerland.  The centre-right European People’s party’s (EPP’s) economic and monetary affairs spokesperson had demanded on Monday that the European Commission reconsider whether Switzerland posed a threat to the financial integrity of the bloc. What is the Suisse secrets leak? Suisse secrets is a global journalistic investigation into a leak of data from the Swiss bank Credit Suisse. It comprises more than 18,000 bank accounts that were leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung by a whistleblower who said Swiss banking secrecy laws were ""immoral"". The data, which is only a partial capture of the bank’s 1.5 million private banking clients, is linked to more than 30,000 Credit Suisse clients. The leak includes personal, shared and corporate bank accounts – holding, on average, 7.5m Swiss francs (CHF). Almost 200 accounts in the data are worth more than 100m CHF, and more than a dozen are valued in the billions. While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today. The Guardian was among more than 48 media partners around the world including journalists at Le Monde, NDR, the Miami Herald and the New York Times. They spent months using the data to investigate the bank, in a project coordinated by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). They unearthed evidence Credit Suisse accounts had been used by clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, suggesting widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. It is not illegal to have a Swiss account and the leak also contained data of legitimate clients who had done nothing wrong. In its response, Credit Suisse said it ""strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices"". On Tuesday, spokespeople for the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and Renew Europe, the second- and third-largest groupings representing the left and centre-left in the parliament respectively, expressed support for the move. It could mean Switzerland being added to an EU list of rogue nations considered at high risk for money laundering, such as Iran, Syria and North Korea. “These latest revelations show that too many of the world’s largest banks have still not learned their lesson. Banks are only too willing to accept dirty money, as long as they can pocket the fees,” said Jonás Fernández, an S&D MEP and spokesperson for economic and monetary affairs. “Money laundering thrives on secrecy and banks being able to operate in the shadows without consequence. While we are fighting social inequalities and paying for our recovery from the pandemic, the Suisse secrets remind us of the true injustices that we are up against.” He continued: “The EU has to look again at Switzerland’s anti-money-laundering credentials and ensure the EU’s list of high-risk countries is fit for purpose as an instrument for fighting dirty money.” Renew Europe’s economic affairs spokesperson, Luis Garicano, said: “The Suisse secrets investigation suggests serious shortcomings in the Swiss banking system, which raise grave ethical and regulatory concerns.” “We expect the European Commission to take these findings into consideration when it next reviews its list of high-risk third countries. The fact that the world’s criminals and despots can launder money so easily on the EU’s doorstep is unacceptable.” The three groupings constitute 60% of the European parliament, suggesting a majority of members now favour stringent action to tackle Switzerland’s behaviour as a tax haven. However, the move would also need political support from the European Commission, as well as from individual EU member states. Still, discussion of being added to a blacklist caused alarm in Switzerland. Responding to the debate after the leak, the Swiss Bankers Association said the country’s financial sector “has no interest in money of dubious origin. It attaches the greatest importance to the maintenance of its reputation and integrity”. Credit Suisse said in its statement about the leak that it “strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices”, adding that alleged failures were largely historical and, in some instances, dated back to “a time where laws, practices and expectations of financial institutions were very different from where they are now”. However, reaction in Washington and Geneva also points to growing anger at Switzerland over the Suisse secrets disclosures, which revealed how Credit Suisse had provided secret bank accounts for an array of high-risk clients over decades. Ron Wyden, the chair of the US Senate committee on finance, expressed “great concern” about what he described as “Credit Suisse’s decades-long facilitation of money laundering and tax evasion”. “These crimes are only possible when bad actors in the financial system look the other way and put profits ahead of following the law,” Wyden said in a statement. The finance committee is currently assessing whether Credit Suisse has complied with a 2014 agreement with the Department of Justice in which it promised to cease enabling tax evasion by US citizens. The Swiss government has yet to respond to the suggestion it may be added to the EU’s money-laundering blacklist, which would require enhanced due diligence on any transaction or commercial relationship with a person or company in the country. However, the publication of the leak, which was initially sent by an anonymous whistleblower to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, has prompted a rare debate in Switzerland about the wisdom of the country’s banking secrecy laws. Some have expressed outrage that the laws had prevented Swiss journalists from joining the investigation into the leak, which involved media such as the Guardian, Le Monde, New York Times and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). Swiss journalists demanded urgent reform of article 47 of the banking secrecy law, which has in recent years been broadened in a way that potentially criminalises whistleblowing and public interest journalism. Arthur Rutishauser, the editor of Switzerland’s Tamedia, which has previously joined international investigations including the HSBC Files and Panama and Paradise papers, angrily denounced the expanded article 47 in a statement explaining why his news organisation had been prevented from joining the Suisse secrets investigation. Article 47 has existed since the early 20th century. However, it was expanded to include third parties outside of banks in 2015, after several cases of banking insiders handing client data to foreign tax authorities, including a CD of data from HSBC Private Bank Suisse that was subsequently accessed by journalists. On Monday, the general secretary of the European Federation of Journalists, Ricardo Gutiérrez, accused Switzerland of violating “fundamental principles of press freedom”. “Switzerland simply does not respect European legal standards on freedom of expression and freedom of the press,” he said. “It favours the particular interest of bankers over the general interest. The necessary public debate is confiscated. “The case law of the European court of human rights, which authorises the disclosure of confidential information as long as it serves the public interest, is not applied in Switzerland. This practice is worthy of the worst authoritarian states. It must be stopped.”",News/News,Calls grow for EU to add Switzerland to money-laundering blacklist,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/22/credit-suisse-leak-three-largest-parties-call-for-eu-to-assess-switzerland-risk
2/23/2022,"An airline has become the first to be fined for failing to ensure that passengers complied with Covid-19 regulations in England. The Romanian carrier Blue Air pleaded guilty to five offences at Uxbridge magistrates court on Tuesday, including not checking that passengers arriving at Heathrow had completed a passenger locator form (PLF).  The firm also admitted to not checking whether a passenger arriving at the London airport produced the required evidence of a negative pre-departure coronavirus test. It was fined £40,000 for the breaches. The ruling marked the first prosecution of an airline under the Covid Enforcement Regulations, which gave fresh powers to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to regulate Covid rules for international travel. Blue Air had previously received fixed penalty notices for breaking the rules, but did not seek to resolve them with the CAA – or to pay them.The CAA consumer director, Paul Smith, said: “While we generally observe high levels of compliance from airlines against the regulations, it is important for consumer confidence and public health that failures to follow the requirements are dealt with appropriately. “It is important that airlines including Blue Air continue to engage with us going forward. The UK Civil Aviation Authority will always look to prosecute breaches of compliance where necessary.” The requirement for people entering England to take a pre-departure test before they travelled was scrapped by the Department for Transport in January for fully vaccinated travellers, while the “day 2” test taken after arrival in the country was scrapped for double-jabbed arrivals earlier this month. However, unvaccinated travellers are still expected to comply with the regulations and all arrivals must continue to complete a PLF, which has since been made easier to complete. The legal requirement to self-isolate for those who test positive for Covid will end on Thursday, the UK government announced this week.",News/Business,Romanian airline Blue Air fined over Heathrow passenger Covid breaches,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/romanian-airline-blue-air-fined-over-heathrow-passenger-covid-breaches
2/23/2022,"Not far from Silicon Valley, a technological boom is occurring among beekeepers desperate to find new ways to avoid hives being stolen by criminals amid a dwindling supply of bees across the US.  Thefts are becoming so common in the Central Valley area of California that beekeepers are using GPS tracking devices, surveillance cameras and other anti-theft technology to safeguard their honeybee colonies. According to the Associated Press, 1,036 beehives worth hundreds of thousands of dollars have been reported stolen in California, including a heist in which 384 beehives were spirited away in Mendocino county. “We have do what we can to protect ourselves,” Helio Medino, a beekeeper who had 282 hives stolen last year, told the AP. “Nobody can help us.” The Central Valley is responsible for about a quarter of all produce grown in the US but beekeepers from all corners of the country are drawn to the region primarily for the enormous pollination demands of the almond industry, which has doubled in size over the past two decades. There are 1.17m acres of almonds in California that require pollination. At a standard rate of two beehives an acre, that means the industry somehow needs to amass 2.34m beehives for a short window of time each February, when almond trees start to blossom. This demand requires that approximately 90% of all managed US honeybee colonies are strapped to trucks and sent to the Central Valley when the trees are in flower. Thieves, typically people with knowledge of beekeeping, are targeting the hives at night, as they are set down near orchards or in holding areas. Organized gangs are behind some of the thefts, police say, with hives quickly moved on for resale after identifying markers are removed. Thefts are escalating because of the tightening supply of bees and soaring pollination fees: almond farmers who paid about $50 to rent a single beehive a few years ago now often pay more than $200 a hive. Stealing hives has therefore become relatively lucrative. “Normal people can’t just go steal 500 hives with a forklift and a truck,” Charley Nye, a beekeeper researcher at University of California, Davis, told the Guardian in 2020. “So it’s a pretty small pool of people that are able to steal them. But the reward is so big that I think it can be tempting to people to do that.” Honeybees are being assailed by disease, loss of habitat to monocultural farmland and widespread use of pesticides. The drought that has gripped the western US has also weakened colonies, piling further pressure on beekeepers to maintain numbers for the huge logistical exercise of pollinating crops. The effort put in to replenish honeybee populations for agricultural purposes is not replicated for the thousands of wild bee species in the US, however. About a quarter of North America’s 46 bumblebee species are in decline and threatened with extinction, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. Experts have warned that a widespread decline of bee species is risking food security in parts of the world, with the demands for pollinated crops increasing by 300% worldwide in the past 50 years as the pollination supply falters due to habitat destruction, the use of poisonous insecticides and the climate crisis.

2/23/2022,"The mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan are edged with a tangerine glow as our minibus drives past them. We set off earlier from Erbil, the region’s capital, and are driving to Shaqlawa, a historic city about 50 minutes away, to hike up the nearby Safeen mountain. Inside the minibus, a group of teenage girls are playing their favourite songs. The teenagers live with their families in one of Erbil’s two main camps for internally displaced people (IDPs), Baharka and Harsham, having fled Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, and surrounding towns such as Tal Afar and Sinjar, when the area was captured by ISISsis in 2014. The hike has been organised by Free to Run, an NGO that supports and empowers women and girls in regions of conflict through sport, offering them life-skills training, and creating safe spaces for them to develop confidence and friends, and to reclaim public space in a country where women’s rights are lacking.  War magnifies existing inequalities and makes women and girls, in particular, vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. The girls at Free to Run have lived through two: the Iraq War (2003-2011), and the war with ISISsis (2014-2017). They’ve not only suffered the trauma of having to flee their homes. M, many have lost loved ones and missed out on education. Now they are stuck in a cycle of poverty. Free to Run was established in 20184 and the executive director is Taylor Smith, an American human-rights advocate. The programme has enrolled 30 girls from Baharka and Harsham this year alone. Smith told me that due to their age, backgrounds, and socioeconomic status as IDPs, the girls “struggle more with access to public life, the ability to play sports, and autonomy over their own bodies”. In their home towns, many of the programme’s participants were only allowed to play sport until they reached puberty, “at which point communities and families said it was inappropriate for them to continue”. Faiza, who is 15, is one of the more confident girls participating in the Free to Run programme, and despite her gentle demeanour, her favourite sport is kickboxing, which the programme teaches. (Some names have been changed, to protect identities.) “Kickboxing isn’t just a form of exercise for me,” she says when we meet at her home. “It is a way to live my dreams.” Before she enrolled in Free to Run two years ago she was shy and withdrawn. “Even when someone said, ‘hi,’ I didn’t like to say ‘hi’ back. But now I feel stronger, like I can protect myself.” Faiza lives in Baharka Camp, along with 2,700 other children, plus their families. The camp sits on a flat plain; Erbil rises out of the dust in the distance. When I visit, boys climb on the wire fence that surrounds the camp on its perimeter; all around there are tents and concrete blocks. When she’s not at school, Faiza helps her mother to clean their home, plays with Barbie dolls, and has started learning new languages. She has lived in the camp for several years; she left her home town when it was destroyed by Isis. “I feel sorry for my family,” she tells me. “I wish to get more money so I can buy a house for them and live in Erbil city, because I don’t like to stay in the camp. But we are forced to stay here – it is the only way.” She describes her Iraqi home town as being “like a prison,” and says she wouldn’t want to return even if she could. “People there are stricter and more religious,” she tells me. If she were to leave her home without a hijab, she would be reprimanded. “Even running – they wouldn’t let me do it.” If she ever returns, she says, she “won’t be able to fulfil any of my dreams”. She goes to get ready for school. When she returns, she is dressed in a white dress and a black hijab, and she is wearing a hint of red lipstick. She asks to have her photo taken for her ID. Last year, her father died of Covid – he was 37 – and before that Faiza’s grandfather was kidnapped and killed by Isis. She is the family’s eldest daughter, and now she is expected to marry quickly. Child marriage is illegal in Kurdistan – Iraqi law states the minimum age for marriage is 18 – though it is still common and widespread. But some are fighting against this. Shaimaa, now 24, was one of the first girls to enrol with Free to Run, in 2018. She had divorced her husband, whom she married in 2015, aged 17, and who was abusive. Ashamed of Shaimaa’s decision to divorce, her family shunned her. One uncle beat her. But she persevered, eventually finding sanctuary in sports, particularly running, for which she has won numerous medals for. She began encouraging other displaced women and girls to sign up to Free to Run, spreading the word around Baharka Camp, where she lived, before becoming a coach for the programme and working with Save The Children on local projects. In 2020, she moved out of the camp and into an apartment nearby. “I feel free when I run, far from prisons and war,” she said in an interview with Time Magazine last year. “I feel like there are no limits and nothing to stop me.” Nine girls from the Free to Run programme, including Faiza and her neighbour, Laila, are taking part in the hike up Safeen Mmountain. Pine trees and apple trees dot the trail, which is steep and difficult in parts – loose stones make it slippery. A passing male hiker stops to say it is “too difficult for girls”, but the girls ignore him and continue upwards. Juan, Free to Run’s programme officer, a friendly Kurdish woman, leads the hike. She says the girls see her as not just their “second mother”, but also as their friend. It makes her proud to see the progress they make, she says. “Before [enrolling in Free to Run] they were depressed – I could see it in their faces. But month by month they started changing.” We reach a cave, and the girls immediately start climbing the rocks and taking photos of each other. “[During the Free to Run programme] we learned not to be afraid any more,” says Wafaa, 16, as they tuck into their snacks. “Before, when we went to these places, we were afraid, and now we see it’s very normal and easy.” Hiba, a 14-year-old girl, adds philosophically: “Hiking is like life. It is challenging, but it is better to go through these challenges and get to the other end.” Hiba lived in Mosul under the thumb of Isis, only leaving once the city was liberated following a lengthy battle in 2017. Her school was destroyed by the fighting, and her parents didn’t allow her to leave the house. “I just used to play inside my home with my sister and brother,” she says. “I was so scared I felt like I wanted to die – I wanted to get away from all these feelings. When I left my home in Mosul and came to Baharka Camp, all the way I felt scared that something bad would happen. But when I arrived in Erbil I could feel the freedom, like a big weight on my chest was lifted.” One of the other girls, Bushra, is particularly boisterous, climbing and running around. Juan says she is always hyperactive and sometimes gets into trouble for it. The 16-year-old didn’t have any friends before joining Free to Run. “My mum used to ask me: ‘Why don’t you go out like other girls?’” she says. “I didn’t like to meet anyone, not even my relatives when they came to my home. My friends at Free to Run are the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to me.” Bushra is from Mosul, and lived under Isis from 2014 to 2016. “I miss Mosul because I miss my dad – all my memories of him are there.” Bushra’s father was killed in 2016 by the terrorist group while he was fighting in the Iraqi army. A photo of him is stuck to a wall in their home in Harsham Camp, with a bouquet of fake flowers next to it. Although they receive financial compensation from the government, it is not enough, says her mother, who works as a cleaner at the school in the camp. Bushra’s extended family wanted her to stop school and marry her 16-year-old cousin, but Bushra refused, and her mother supported the decision. “I try to encourage my daughter to study in order to get a good job in the future and become independent,” she explains, sitting next to Bushra on the floor of their home. “I got married so young, when I was 15 years old. I don’t want my daughter to live the same life as me. I became a widow at 24, and had to provide for my family. I don’t want her to clean the same school that I clean now.” Bushra says she would like to be a lawyer when she’s older. “I want to help others who have been through a similar thing to us,” she tells me. “It is painful whenever we go to the government to ask for any help.” There are 294 families inside Harsham Camp, including 811 children, who have little to do during the day when they are not at school, which only lasts a few hours. Mostly they play on the roads, though there have been accidents. Children have been hit by cars, says Alva Aied Ali, the Harsham Camp manager. When the government electricity runs out – power cuts are frequent – there is no back-up generator to keep the electricity going in the camp’s primary and secondary school. “Since the end of the war a lot of NGOs have withdrawn their support from the camp, so we are struggling,” says Aied Ali. “Living in this camp is a bad situation and, especially for the children. It is like a prison. So [Free to Run] is a good opportunity for them to get away from the camp,” says Ayad, a serious-looking man with a thick black moustache. He is the father of Tagreed, 16, who joined Free to Run a year ago. We meet them at their home in Harsham Camp, where Tagreed lives with her parents, two sisters and four brothers. She enjoys the group’s “team spirit,” she says, and loves running – they train four times a week in a local park in Erbil and ran a 10k race in November. She hopes to run the Erbil Marathon in May 2022. “I would not let my daughter carry on running when she stops the Free to Run programme, not because of me but because of the society inside the camp,” says Ayad. “Most of them are religious, strict people, so they will talk about my daughter if she goes out alone, even to the market or running. Even though she is young, people in the camp think that women should just go out for one reason – just to go to her husband’s house and to get married, nothing else.” However, both Ayad and Diana, his wife, are adamant that Tagreed should finish her schooling. “I don’t care what society says, I will make all my children continue their education. I don’t want them to marry early – it is against my values,” says Diana. Tagreed tells me that she wants to keep running, no matter what. “Even if the community don’t like me running in the park, I don’t care; I feel strong and I will continue with my running.” The girls have overcome many obstacles; they have many more to face in the future. Their horizons may have broadened since joining Free to Run, but a lot still depends on the willingness of their families and wider community to give them the right to control their own futures. I ask Juan if she thinks there is change in the air when it comes to the patriarchal culture that is still so ingrained. “It cannot change 180 degrees,” she says, “but actually I see it is changing 60 or 70 degrees, and that is good.” On the drive back from the hike the girls stand up in the minibus and clap to the music, before deciding that is not enough. We pull over and they teach me some Arabic dance moves on the side of a road. Wafaa takes my hand and we dance in a circle, Bushra shakes her hips to the music, Laila claps, Hiba sways, and Faiza waves her hands in the air. Juan watches, laughing and clapping along. Even the occasional beep from a passing car won’t deter them.

2/23/2022,"People visiting care homes in England will have to pay for Covid tests from April, Downing Street has said, prompting criticism from relatives’ groups, charities and opposition MPs. While the full details of precisely who will still be eligible for free tests when charges are introduced from 1 April has yet to be set out, Boris Johnson’s official spokesperson confirmed those visiting care homes would not be included.  “This [free testing] is targeted at the most vulnerable and frontline staff,” he said. While NHS and care staff will have free tests if they show Covid symptoms, it remains to be decided if they will have access to wider asymptomatic testing, with the health department and NHS England setting this out “in due course”, he added. The current guidance for visiting people in care homes is that “visitors should receive a negative lateral flow test result and report it on the day of their visit, either by conducting the test at home or when they arrive at the care home”. The Relatives and Residents Association (R&RA) said that if this guidance was to remain in place it was “unfair” to ask people to pay for tests to see their loved ones, or expect financially stressed care homes to pay. “To say, given all you have been through and all the relationships that have been ruined [by visiting restrictions] that you can start rebuilding those relationships but you have to pay for tests seems unfair and extraordinary,” said Helen Wildbore, director of the R&RA. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the idea was a “tax on caring”. He said: “It is simply unjust and unfair to force people to pay hundreds of pounds a year to safely visit their loved ones. It will make vulnerable people more alienated, more lonely, and act as a barrier for family and friends getting together. We must stop this tax on caring.” Ruth Driscoll, head of public affairs for the charity Marie Curie, which assists people with terminal illness, said the change would be a concern to many such people and their families. “While at least some vulnerable groups will continue to have access to free symptomatic testing, it must be clarified that people with a terminal illness, their loved ones, and all those working with them will be included in this,” she said. “People with a terminal illness and their families already face major financial stress due to the high cost of living and energy price hikes – we must ensure they can afford to get tested and stay safe when restrictions come to an end in April.” The end of almost all free lateral flow and PCR tests was announced by Boris Johnson on Monday, as part of a package that will end all domestic Covid restrictions in England.",News/World news,People visiting care homes in England will have to pay for Covid test,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/people-visiting-care-homes-in-england-will-have-to-pay-for-covid-test

But I felt like I had to tune in this time. I was witnessing history in the making,” she said, smoking an e-cigarette. “But I am not sure yet if history is going in the right direction.”  The day after the Russian leader’s late-night speech, in which he recognised the independence of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, Muscovites were digesting what Putin’s decision could mean for them and their futures. While he ended his address by “congratulating” fellow Russians on the recognition of the two territories, a celebratory mood was absent in the capital, with many fretting about the political and economic consequences his decision might have. “If the recognition brings peace to the region, fine, why not do it,” said Andrei, a regional director at a large logistics firm in Moscow. “But it is already costing me money. I have invested a lot of my savings in shares of Russian companies.” The self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk are two territories run by separatist governments widely seen as Russian proxy states inside Ukraine. Since 2014, they have been in conflict with Kyiv, which refers to them as “temporarily occupied territories”, similar to Crimea. They have received military and financial backing from Moscow since they declared their existence after the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. The territories cover an area of about 6,500 sq miles and were primarily known before the war for their heavy industry and coal mining. Donetsk, the largest city, previously had an international airport and hosted matches during the Uefa Euro 2012 championship. The fighting has destroyed the airport and left the territories, mostly cut off from the rest of Ukraine, in a dire economic state. The borders with Russia remain open. What are their relationship to Moscow? On 21 February, Vladimir Putin said he would recognise the separatist-held territories as independent states. Up to that point, at an official level, Moscow saw the territories as part of Ukraine, though in reality they were fully controlled by Moscow. It is not yet clear whether the Russian president will extend his territorial claim to the parts of Donetsk and Luhansk not already until his control. Who are the people there? Leaked documents suggest there are just under 3 million people remaining in the territories, 38% of whom are pensioners. That’s less than half of the pre-war population. Public opposition in the territories is near non-existent. It has become extremely difficult for independent journalists to go to the region. How many troops are there? It is not clear how large a force is present. Ukraine has claimed there are 35,000 military personnel, 481 battle tanks, 914 armoured combat vehicles, 720 artillery systems, and 202 multiple launch rocket systems. According to Rochan Consulting, however, those numbers could be “overestimated”. Russia’s financial markets sank to their lowest levels in more than a year on Tuesday, after Putin ordered troops into the two territories the previous day. The country’s markets have been extremely volatile of late, with major state banks like Sberbank having lost more than half their value since the start of the Ukraine crisis. As Putin was delivering his address, the Russian independent TV channel Dozhd posted a live feed of the country’s rouble sliding to a near two-year low. “I think I can wave goodbye to my holiday to Turkey in March,” said Andrei, 41, referring to the decline of the national currency. Some in Moscow, however, found genuine joy in Putin’s move to recognise the self-proclaimed republics, in what they saw as a long-overdue decision by the Russian state. “Bless Putin! He is finally taking the Donbas under our wing,” said Galina Gromova, while waiting for a bus in central Moscow. Gromova, a high school geography teacher, said she was “horrified” by Russian state media reports of the Ukrainians shelling the Donbas and felt “enraged” by Kyiv’s “genocide” of the local population. The west and Kyiv have criticised such reports as “fake news”, saying Moscow was creating a pretext for an invasion. Andrei Kolesnikov, a political analyst and senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Centre, said there was no expectation that Russians “would rally around the flag” after Putin’s speech in the same manner as when the country annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014, after which Putin’s approval ratings reached heights of 89%. “Crimea was an absolutely unique event in which Putin practically had the backing of all parts of society,” he said. “But the country is much more split on the future of the Donbas.” He pointed to recent data collected by the independent Levada Center pollster, indicating that 53% of Russians would want the two regions recognised as independent or as part of Russia, while 26% saw the future of the region with Ukraine. The remainder of those polled, 21%, were undecided on the issue. In Kolesnikov’s view, how the Russian public will ultimately perceive these events will depend on what the Kremlin decides to do next. “Many will welcome the scenario in which the situation calms down after yesterday’s recognition of the region,” he said. “Russians do not have an appetite for a real war with Ukraine, it is currently not a militarised society.” US intelligence continues to stress that Russia is planning a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, while Putin’s latest impassioned speech – with its attempts to rewrite Ukraine’s history – will further fuel fears in Kyiv. But there is also some hope that Putin will not embark on a major military campaign in Ukraine, fearing the unpredictability of what a significant war on the European continent could entail. “The Kremlin gains domestic legitimacy from confrontation with the west, as long as bullets aren’t being fired,” said Prof Samuel Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King’s College London, whose research examines Putin’s sources of popularity. “Actual war brings uncertainty and we do not know how it will play out in public opinion or on the battlefield,” he added. Whatever Russia’s next move is, Britain on Tuesday imposed sanctions on five Russian banks and three high net-worth individuals and, even more worryingly for the Kremlin, Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said he would not certify the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Parts of Russia’s business elite said they were now preparing for the worst. Its leaders were once among Putin’s biggest supporters but have been sidelined over the years, as Putin has increasingly surrounded himself with the so-called siloviki, security men, many of whom served in the KGB. “I was slightly shell-shocked when I watched the presidential address, my hair stood at the back of my neck,” said a veteran banker at a private firm, speaking by phone on condition of anonymity. “It’s finally sinking in amongst many around me how bad the situation is,” the banker sighed. “This looks like only the start of a very bumpy long road.”",News/World news,‘This is a bumpy long road’: the mood among Moscow residents,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/bumpy-long-road-mood-moscow-russia-ukraine
2/23/2022,"The US coast guard has released dramatic footage of a fisher being lifted to a helicopter after being bitten on the arm by a shark.  The coast guard in Miami was contacted on Monday by the crew of “the motor vessel Shear Water”, the agency said in a statement. The crew reported “a man aboard who had been bitten by a shark while fishing and that a tourniquet had been placed on the man’s arm to prevent further blood loss”. The man was bitten onboard. It was not clear what sort of shark was involved. A helicopter responded to the scene, near the Bahamas, and extracted the 51-year-old. Footage released by the coast guard showed the man being winched from the moving boat in choppy seas, one arm heavily bound. “This was the best possible outcome to a truly terrifying situation,” said Sean Connett, command duty officer at US coast guard district seven, in Miami. “This individual was fortunate a fellow crew member was able to render aid prior to the coast guard’s arrival which allowed for a quick extraction from the vessel.” #BREAKING @USCG Air Station Miami air crews rescued a 51-year-old man, Monday, after he was bitten by a shark while fishing aboard a vessel near #Bimini, #Bahamas. #SearchAndRescueMore here: https://t.co/Ee7XiDQ06z pic.twitter.com/ocuhDrdQvo The International Shark Attack File, at the University of Florida, distinguishes between provoked and unprovoked bites. Unprovoked bites, it says, “are defined as incidents in which a bite on a live human occurs in the shark’s natural habitat with no human provocation of the shark. “Provoked bites occur when a human initiates interaction with a shark in some way. These include instances when divers are bitten after harassing or trying to touch sharks, bites on spear-fishers, bites on people attempting to feed sharks, bites occurring while unhooking or removing a shark from a fishing net and so forth.” In 2021, the ISAF recorded 73 unprovoked bites and 39 provoked. The risk that a human will be bitten or killed by shark remains extremely low. . Many more are killed each year by toasters, chairs and other household items. In 2021, the ISAF also recorded four “boat bites”, in which sharks bit boats. Sharks often use biting as an exploratory tool.

2/23/2022,"It says a lot about the Ukrainian people’s awful options that the big question is whether Vladimir Putin is crazy or just pretending to be crazy. For some, last night’s entirely improvised, heavily staged speech to his security council was an indication that the Russian president has finally gone mad – a remote diagnosis that suggests we might look back on such things as the annexing of Crimea and the deployment of nerve agent in historic Wiltshire as “his good years”. I should say right off the bat that I have no idea whether Putin has or hasn’t gone mad – however unfashionable not knowing things may be these days. As Russian tanks roll into Ukraine and the western powers debate whether it technically is or isn’t an invasion, you have to say this phoney war really does boast an unbelievable headcount of phoneys.  Russia experts now seem to outnumber even Russian army personnel. Column inches and airwaves and social media channels are truly awash with those blessed with the confidence to begin “here’s how Putin thinks…” or “watch what happens next”. Who knew the potential advent of war would feel like being the girl in the nightclub meme, with some PPE bore bellowing his take in your ear as you wonder if 21st-century geopolitics has an Ask for Angela option. That said, it’s great to see Britain boasting such an adaptable and highly reactive workforce, able to retrain at enviable speed. The people who became trade experts in 2016, then became epidemiology experts in 2020, have now become Russian politics experts. My sole area of expertise – and it’s not even that, if we’re honest – is “the type of people who become newspaper columnists”. So take it from one who knows: Boris Johnson looks like he knows enough about the entire Russia-Ukraine subject to write two newspaper columns on it. Three, tops, if you count a rehash of his referendum campaign speech when he blamed the EU for Putin being forced to invade Ukraine last time round. I see Johnson has this morning “unveiled” some sanctions on five Russian banks and a grand total of three high net worth individuals. If Putin makes further incursions, he can expect a fixed penalty notice (overturned on appeal). But back to last night in Moscow and Putin himself – the only megarich Russian who doesn’t get their cosmetic surgery done in London. His face is now so impassive that it must have had an entire Real Housewives franchise worth of work. To watch his Lebensraum speech was to be given the shivers, but also to be struck by the grotesque self-pity of it all. Why are strongmen like this? The age has been awash with such politicians, from Trump to Kim to Bolsonaro, with their endless, aggressively maudlin demands for respect. Putin feels like the world-war version of every guy you’ve ever trodden on eggshells around because “his bark’s worse than his bite” or “that way he’ll calm down quicker”, only to discover one day that it isn’t and he won’t. Further along the human centipede, these sentimental hardmen are assisted by media Haw Haws like Fox News’s Tucker Carlson or GB News’s Nigel Farage – guys with such an overwhelming yen for the respect they feel they themselves were denied at some key point in their lives that their deepest human empathy is reserved for a foreign authoritarian also not getting his due. Is a lack of respect really what’s happening? To this untrained observer, with only her memories to go on, it does feel rather as if Vlad has been ardently pursuing diplomatic resolution with Ukraine somewhat in the way Dubya Bush was ardently pursing diplomatic resolution with Iraq in early 2003. Which is to say, there seems a rather unconvincing theatre to it all. And, indeed, a law of unintended consequences. Four years after the Iraq invasion, one V Putin delivered a conference speech in Munich in which he fumed about US actions in Iraq, lamenting that now “no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them”. Which has arguably turned out to be some more rather unconvincing theatre in itself. Spool forward to the present day, and events seem to be developing very fast. Perhaps this is what the early stages of war look like. Sajid Javid felt confident enough to call last night’s tank manoeuvres an “invasion”, which contrasts markedly with the grey area/brainmelt defence secretary Geoff Hoon found himself in back in 2003 after the first night of shock-and-awe bombing of Baghdad. Seconds before he was about to go live on a breakfast TV interview the next morning, Hoon turned frantically to an aide and asked “Are we at war?” “Geoff, we’re in the initial stages,” came the calming response. “Yes, but are we at war?!” Hoon wanted to know. “We’re in the initial stages,” he was firmly told again. I mean … he was secretary of state for defence. Nobody knows anything, do they? For those of us with the incalculable luxury of watching events from afar, meanwhile, the images currently on our screens are striking yet timeworn. The male-female ratio is wild, with giant roomfuls of men in suits from New York to Moscow punctuated by only the odd woman – Liz Truss, say, or Valentina Matviyenko, the sole female at Putin’s security council event. An unwritten law dictates that each of the leading men must be photographed scowling into a telephone diurnally, as though someone has just said “I’m afraid there is a problem with your order – your order to invade/de-escalate/stage a false flag/buy gas from Russia ever again.” Live action shots are more fraught. Politicians wary of going accidentally off-message, In the Loop-style, prefer the deniable safety of metaphors – and some of them tend toward the Freudian. “We’ve got to make sure that we cut the umbilicus,” explained Johnson of European reliance on Russian gas supplies. “We snip the drip-feed into the bloodstream from Nord Stream.” Righto. Will Johnson stick around long enough to cut the umbilical cord? (Hardly the first time that question’s been asked.) Unfortunately, the media appearance in which the prime minister intimated he had liberated Britain from Covid clashed in the schedules with the media appearance in which Putin intimated he was about to liberate Ukraine from itself. Consequently, Johnson’s event lost a bit of its oomph. After all, while some people might regard it as the last word in liberty not to have to isolate if they have Covid, others might feel the time for such first-world crowing has passed. There are freedoms and “freedoms”, aren’t there? And one might be about to put the other firmly into perspective.
