12/24/2021,"Cities are attracting more property hunters with demand for flats outstripping that of houses in the autumn, the latest sign that the pandemic-fuelled “race for space” could be waning. UK property prices hit record levels during the pandemic as factors including the rise of home and flexible working fuelled a buying boom outside cities.  However, as staff returned to offices with flexible and hybrid working patterns through the autumn – prior to the emergence of Omicron – interest in flats has surged. “When the housing market reopened in May, there was an immediate rush for room from buyers to look farther afield from the capital,” said Tim Bannister, the director of property data at the property portal Rightmove. “However, in recent months we’ve seen higher demand to live near London, with buyer inquiries returning towards pre-pandemic levels. This is happening quicker than some will have anticipated, and is likely driven by many businesses encouraging a hybrid, rather than fully remote working model.” Rightmove said that flats have become the most in-demand property type among prospective buyers, supplanting the popularity of houses throughout the pandemic. “The complete reversal in demand from bigger houses to flats paints a picture of society opening up again and a group of people looking to be closer to city centres,” said Bannister. “Although there was less demand for flats when the market reopened, with more availability than other property types, and more steady average asking price growth over the last year, flats could be a good opportunity for people looking to move or to get on to the ladder next year.” Rightmove’s findings chime with trends identified by mortgage lender Halifax which found that in November flats were changing hands for 10.8% more than at the same time last year, while detached houses were typically fetching 6.6% more. Despite the boost in popularity of flats, Rightmove said the longer-term trend towards bigger houses, in outer-city and rural or coastal locations, is here to stay. Prospective buyers have widened their searches for their ideal home by an average of 50 sq km (19 sq miles), according to Rightmove. In October, the typical asking price for a detached house was 76% higher than a semi-detached property. “The pandemic redefined the role of the home and placed new emphasis on its importance, and people looked for more room in order to work, exercise, and often teach under one roof,” said Bannister. “People have extended their search area, which suggests there isn’t as much reliance on being near key transport hubs, or realising that living just a bit further away from the high street could open up more properties that a buyer can afford, or they may get more for their money.” Last week, Halifax forecast that the boom in UK house prices is likely to end next year as household finances become increasingly stretched.",News/Business,UK cities attract more property hunters as searches for flats soar,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/24/uk-cities-attract-more-property-hunters-as-searches-for-flats-soar
12/24/2021,"The UK government’s chief scientific adviser has hit back at accusations from Conservative MPs that epidemiological modellers had “spread gloom” over the Omicron variant. Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not the responsibility of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) “to take a particular policy stance or to either spread gloom or give Panglossian optimism”.  He used an article in the Times to respond to criticism that was widely circulated among Tory MPs and ministers that suggested Sage’s Omicron modelling had been an exercise in fear-mongering. The Spectator’s editor, Fraser Nelson, had a Twitter exchange with the Sage member Graham Medley over the weekend, suggesting ministers asked Sage to model worst-case scenarios. The exchange was reportedly widely shared in the WhatsApp groups of Tory MPs. In an account of the exchange in his column in the Telegraph on Monday, Nelson complained that Sage projections that Omicron could kill between 6,000 in a single day had been seized on in the press, and more cautious projections ignored. Nelson wrote: “The 6,000 is the top of a rather long range of ‘scenarios’, not predictions.” He added: “I’ve been contacted by a few ministers saying they were alarmed to think Sage modellers were not giving the probability of various outcomes but cooking up gloomy scenarios to order.” In an apparent riposte, Vallance wrote science was “self-correcting” and making “advances by overturning previous dogma and challenging accepted truths”. He wrote: “Encouraging a range of opinions, views and interpretation of data is all part of the process. No scientist would ever claim, in this fast-changing and unpredictable pandemic, to have a monopoly of wisdom on what happens next.” A widely reported statement from the Spi-M group of scientists, who report to Sage, on 18 December warned hospitalisations could peak between 3,000 and 10,000 a day and deaths at between 600 and 6,000 a day based on models assuming no new restrictions were introduced. Vallance said modellers were “trying to model lots of different scenarios of how the wave of Omicron might grow, determine which factors are likely to have the biggest impact on spread and its consequences, and to assess how different interventions might alter the outcomes”. He added: “They do not, contrary to what you might have heard, only model the worst outcomes.” The comments follow an interview the scientist did with Radio 4 in October in which he said his job was “not to sugarcoat” reality. He said at the time: “My mantra for a long time during this (pandemic) has been … ‘You’ve got to go sooner than you want to in terms of taking interventions. You’ve got to go harder than you want to, and you’ve got to go more geographically broad than you want to.”",News/World news,Vallance hits back at Tory accusations of Omicron fear-mongering,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/vallance-hits-back-at-tory-accusations-of-omicron-fear-mongering
12/24/2021,"We’re all programmed to dance, says Janette Manrara. “Babies can’t walk, they can’t talk, but put a song on and they start to wobble.” One of the first things she did, growing up in a Cuban family in Miami, was to stand on her dad’s feet when he danced salsa. You’ll probably know Manrara from her role as a professional dancer on Strictly Come Dancing, and from presenting its companion show, It Takes Two. She’s the real deal, and she’s going to teach me how to dance.  Somewhere inside me, I know what she means about being programmed. Music is important to me, and when it’s the right kind of music I feel the urge to move to it. But I haven’t progressed much past the wobble stage. I’ve never really felt entirely comfortable – even at ease – on the dancefloor. The odds aren’t exactly stacked in my favour: I’m a gangly, introverted, English, now 56-year-old bloke – maybe it’s OK to throw in the towel on this one and accept my place as a wilting wallflower. But the issue is less about the shape or age of my body, more about what’s going on inside my head. It’s about self-consciousness and self-confidence, too much and too little, respectively. I enjoy dancing, but I worry about how I look when I do it, and what other people are thinking. That’s why I generally only do it when I am drunk. Or on my own. Often both, actually. And right now, I’m neither. It’s midday, we’re in a bright dance studio in Fulham, west London, and it’s scaring the hell out of me. There are mirrors all along one wall – that’s not going to help the self-consciousness. It’s also a constant reminder of how un-alone I am. It’s not even just me and Manrara – Lucy from BBC publicity is here, and so is David the Guardian photographer, with all his stuff. “Forget he’s here,” says Manrara. “Dancing is not about showing off, it’s about feeling a certain way, and as soon as you realise that you’re not doing it for anybody else except for you, you will look good dancing, and enjoy it.” We start with a little warm up: shaking, loosening, head-lolling, after which Manrara says I seem to have good self-awareness and I get a celebratory double fist-bump. Now she’s going to teach me the basics of salsa. “Because salsa is the least technical, you don’t need to think much, as long as you can follow the timing.” Aiming not too high, then. The steps I’m learning are less like the competition-standard Latin dance moves you see on Strictly, more like something you might see at a family party in Cuba. I’m happy with that; take me to the family party in Cuba. “It’s not a performance,” she says. First without music, she shows me: step forward, back, close feet, step back, forward, close feet. Now lifting the feet a bit, whoops, no, that way. Next right and left, legs bent a bit, less stiff, less like a salsa-robot. What about my arms? I never know what to do with my arms. “Imagine you’re playing the drums, hands in front, elbows out, and your hands are going the opposite way to your feet. And move the hips.” She wiggles her hips, like a slalom skier. I waggle mine, like a drunk tripping over. The hips don’t lie. But I think they can wait; baby steps and all that. Manrara then puts on some salsa music, loud, though not quite loud enough to drown out my inhibitions. Now she’s in front of me: “Don’t look down, or you’ll step on my feet,” she says. Where to look then? I’m not ready for eye contact; I settle for over her shoulder. OK, fine, it’s not so bad. But it’s quite a specific routine that Manrara has taught me, and I’ve been able to follow. But I also want to be confident, you know, just dancing, at a club (unlikely, these days, to be honest), at a wedding, possibly, dad dancing to I Will Survive, Staying Alive or Thriller. “There is no right or wrong, it’s about letting go. When a song comes on that you love, forget who’s around, it’s about you; just be Sam. What’s your favourite song?” God, my favourite song, so many … “Your favourite style of music, then?” Er, I like a lot of reggae? She puts on Bob Marley’s Could You Be Loved and tells me to close my eyes and relax. That – eyes closed – is a good one. I’m not in a bright studio with a famous dancer off the telly and a photographer from a national newspaper, I’m in a beach bar … Don’t let them change ya, O! Or even rearrange ya! Oh no! And I’m beginning to wobble, in a good way – well, my way, I don’t care if it’s good or not, remember? I still don’t know what to do with my arms … “Put them up!” says Manrara. What, in the air? I don’t think I do that … well, maybe once, in Ibiza in 1987, but I’m not really a “hands in the air” kind of guy. So I just wave them around a bit – but then I hear David clicking away with his camera, and I remember where I am and why I’m here, and it kind of ruins the moment. Still, I get a double high five, and guess what: Manrara says I’ve got natural internal rhythm! Ha! Obviously she tells everyone that, but I’m taking it. Anyway, back to the salsa, and she wants to try one more thing. Remember the step: forward, back, close feet, back, forward, close feet, then side, side. But now she takes hold of my hands … And that’s making me self-conscious all over again. I should have mentioned the hand operation I had a couple of weeks ago, the fresh scar It might feel a bit weird and rough – is that why she’s recoiling in horror? She’s not recoiling in horror, though – she’s spinning around! Loosen your grip, she says. I see, to make us less twisty, less like a wet towel being wrung out. She spins again, this time more successfully. I’m not going to lie, I’m feeling a tiny bit pleased with myself, not that I had much to do with it. It leads to more congratulations and double high fives. “Own your length!” Manrara tells me. What does that mean? “That’s not being cocky or arrogant or thinking you’re the best when you walk into a room; it’s about loving and embracing all of you. Own it!” Got it: own my length. And I have to promise to go out and dance more often. “Because it really is medicine for the soul, and will help with confidence in all aspects of your life.” Great, I think that’s me cured then. As from today, no one puts Sam in the corner. Janette Manrara hosts the Strictly Come Dancing Live UK Arena Tour, 20 January-13 February.

12/24/2021,"Picking results on a Sunday has been impossible at times with the 2021 season giving every fan at one stage or another a left-field result to revel in. Schadenfreude is very much included in your stocking this year. Detroit’s 30-12 upset thrashing of the Arizona Cardinals last week, the league’s worst team at kickoff beating the joint-best, last may be the finest, freakish morsel to be dissected ad infinitum with us forever shouting: ‘But how Jared Goff?’ into the void. But ‘tis the season so treat yourself to the one-win Jaguars beating the Super Bowl-chasing Bills 9-6 in week nine, or seek out Tennessee’s quintuple turnover tire fire from 21 November as they lost 22-13 to the ... Texans. You would prefer something a little more exquisite? Stay put in week 11 for the anti-vax bowl featuring Minnesota’s upfront pseudo-scientist Kirk Cousins going toe-to-toe with Joe Rogan’s Igor, Aaron Rodgers, in a deliciously painful shootout for the Packers. The greatest joy is the strangest results may still be waiting for us in the lead up to the expanded playoffs. The bubble still shockingly includes Seattle, Atlanta and Washington in the NFC. Stay indoors this Christmas and stare into the abyss, it looks like Ben Roethlisberger’s retirement tour added an extra date in February.  A more conventional delight in 2021 has been the Indianapolis Colts’ breakout star running back, Jonathan Taylor. The fantasy football behemoth’s stellar season has led him to be selected to the Pro Bowl in only his second year after receiving the most votes out of anyone. You name the statistic and Taylor has it locked down. Most yards from scrimmage, check, 1,854. Most touchdowns, 19. Most rushes of 10 or more yards, 42. Twenty or more yards, 11. I could go on, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 or more yards in a single jaunt down the field and Taylor is your man. He now holds the Colts’ franchise record for rushing touchdowns in a single season and will break the record for total touchdowns as he is tied-first at present. He has even made the MVP race quasi-exciting with an outside chance to be the first running back to win since Adrian Peterson in 2012. Taylor’s season-defining display came against New England on Sunday. Bill Belichick’s skill in stopping the opposition’s biggest threat is legendary but could he slow down Taylor? Well, he only scored one touchdown compared to five against the Bills, but his total 170 yards were vital and his tackle-breaking 67-yard scoring dash to clinch the game puts the Colts in a strong position to make the playoffs again this season. They still could surpass Tennessee and win the AFC South, an impossible feat without Taylor. Super Bowl favorites Kansas City had a rough start to the season. Tennessee torched them 27-3 in week seven leaving the Chiefs with a 3-4 record. Two problems were evident: Patrick Mahomes was not at his usual divine level and more pertinently the defense was a complete mess. Cut to seven successive wins later and Mahomes has improved but the opposing unit has been the defining factor in Kanas City’s rise back to the top of the AFC. The defense allowed 17 points or fewer in the six victories leading up their 34-28 win over the Chargers on Sunday. And against LA they were dominant when it mattered most. The Chargers succeeded on only two attempts from five on fourth down and turned the ball over twice. Mahomes linked up with Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce to serve up a reminder of just how explosive this offense can be when it is in sync. Finally Kansas City are playing like a complete team just in time for Kelce, Hill, kicker Harrison Butker and six other starters to be placed on the reserve/Covid-19 list. How they deal with any potential adversity now could define their season. The Dallas Cowboys look like a different prospect this year and the reason is rookie Micah Parsons. The explosive offense still causes opponents huge problems but only when it’s at full strength. Running back injuries have followed Covid-induced receiver absences, and the line has had problems with all being on the field at once, too. But now, they have a defense that can pick up the slack when the offense is not quite firing on all cylinders. Parsons’ versatility is what has transformed the defensive unit. He can line up at any linebacker position or as an edge rusher and significantly change the outcome of a game. A punchy Washington team gave Dallas a run for their money in Week 14 but Parsons kept the Cowboys on top with two sacks and a forced fumble that resulted in a touchdown. Washington never saw him coming as he crept up to the line, blew past four-time Pro Bowler Brandon Scherff and blasted the ball from Taylor Heinicke’s grasp. The league has not seen anything like this for a long time as he shutdown the race for Defensive Rookie of the Year a month ago. Parsons has jumped up a class and is running TJ Watt and Myles Garrett to the wire for Defensive Player of the Year now, an award only Lawrence Taylor has won in his first season. As Santa will attest, coal, technically, is still a present. Not one anyone wants but you get what you are given and the NFL has been hand-delivered a sack-full from Scrooge in residence, Bill Belichick. Momentarily, New England looked like they could fall further in 2021 after the expensive roster retooling led to a 2-4 start but a painful overtime loss to the Cowboys sparked a streak of seven wins, proving you cannot keep the league’s best football mind down for long. The Patriots are back vying for supremacy in the AFC thanks to striking gold with Mac Jones in the draft. The rookie quarterback is managing games like a seasoned veteran while those touted above him have paled in comparison. Trevor Lawrence, Trey Lance, Justin Fields and Zach Wilson have a collective six wins to Jones’s nine. But where is this all leading? It would take a total collapse for the Patriots to miss the playoffs. Belichick will really be demanding his team take back the No 1 seed in the conference and earn a hugely-significant first-round bye. New England should beat the Bills, Jaguars and Dolphins, sealing a 12-5 record and chance of being the AFC’s top billing.
