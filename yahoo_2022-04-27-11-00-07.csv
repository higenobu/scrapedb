4/27/2022,"Elon Musk bought Twitter Monday and could shift its approach to content moderation. One key architect of those content policies is lawyer Vijaya Gadde. Gadde cried during a meeting Monday discussing the acquisition, Politico reported Tuesday, citing ""three people familiar with the meeting."" Twitter's top lawyer and a key voice in decisions such as banning President Donald Trump from the platform became emotional and cried in a meeting with employees discussing Elon Musk's acquisition of the platform on Monday, Politico reported Tuesday. Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's head of legal, policy and trust, is said to have played a large role in content moderation at Twitter, advising former CEO Jack Dorsey, and helping negotiate the deal between Musk and Twitter. Gadde met virtually with employees she supervises in legal and policy on Monday to discuss the buy, Politico reported. She ""acknowledged that there are significant uncertainties about what the company will look like under Musk's leadership,"" the outlet wrote, citing ""three people familiar with the meeting."" The sources told Politico that Gadde cried while relaying concerns about changes to Twitter. She also reportedly said she was proud of the employees and that they should continue to try and make a positive contribution to the company. Former employees have said that they do not feel Musk's ethos matches the company's values (though Dorsey has embraced the buy). ""Any sense that an exodus is building is correct,"" a former Twitter employee told Insider Tuesday. Employees asked about everything from potential layoffs to the reactivation of Donald Trump's Twitter account in an all-hands meeting on Monday, where CEO Parag Agrawal acknowledged there is not a ton of certainty about the platform's future. Musk has remained bullish on free speech, tweeting Tuesday that the platform shouldn't moderate anything that is against the law. Twitter's policies extend far beyond that, penalizing certain content that spreads coronavirus-related misinformation as well as various types of hate speech. The ""free speech"" concern is often cited by conservatives, who have celebrated Musk's buy and long felt Twitter discriminates against right-wing views, especially after deplatforming Trump. Gadde was a driver behind that decision, CNN Business reported in 2021, as did others at the time it occurred. The lawyer's job involves deciding when content can be taken down and has been referred to as Twitter's ""moral authority,"" Politico reported. ""Vijaya is at the crossroads of some of the most important policy decisions the company is making and how it interacts with governments around the world,"" Adam Bain, former Twitter COO who worked with Gadde before he left in 2016, told CNN Business. Gadde also posed the idea to Dorsey of banning political advertising on Twitter altogether, (which happened in 2019) according to Politico Magazine. The outlet profiled her at length in 2020, discussing how she became a lightning rod for conservative criticism and discussed her childhood as an immigrant from India in Beaumont, Texas. There, her father once was advised to seek the permission of the local Klu Klux Klan to sell insurance door to door, she said. Experiences like this and others inspired her to become a lawyer, she said. After her meeting Monday, Gadde appeared to have cheered up employees, some of whom tweeted about her afterwards, Politico reported. ""If you look up the word ""inspiring"" in the dictionary you find a picture of @vijaya,"" public policy associate at Twitter Kennedy O'Brien Tweeted. Twitter did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

4/27/2022,"Officials are warning about the dangers of a “pretty” TikTok trend following an investigation into two mysterious deaths in Wisconsin. Deputies responded to a residential fire on April 6 in Marathon County, the county sheriff’s office said in a news release on April 21. Officials initially treated the incident as a homicide because, after arriving, the homeowners were not immediately found and investigators suspected foul play, Chief Deputy Chad Billeb said in a news conference streamed live by WSAW. Tanya Rodriguez, 44, and James Carolfi, 52, were later found dead in the garage after the blaze had been extinguished, Billeb said, and investigators went to work to determine the cause of the fire. “Due to the nature of this incident and the substantial damage caused by the fire, it was incredibly difficult to determine the cause of death and the series of events,” Billeb said during the news conference. After an investigation, officials discovered that the two had died by electrocution prior to the fire, and their deaths were ruled an accident, the sheriff’s office said. In the weeks since, officials have determined that the deadly electrocution and fire were caused by a trend that has garnered millions of views on TikTok — fractal wood burning, according to the sheriff’s office. The technique uses high-voltage electricity to burn tree-like patterns and designs into wood that has been drenched in a chemical solution, the sheriff’s office said. The sheriff’s office said the tools used for the wood burning caused the deadly electrocution and likely caused the fire in the garage that spread to the rest of the Wisconsin home. “This was a tragic accident,” Billeb said. “In light of this tragedy, we’d like to educate the community on the dangers of fractal wood burning, an art form that has gained popularity on social media sites such as TikTok, Facebook and YouTube.” On TikTok alone, fractal wood burning videos and tutorials have over 11 million views. The process includes a high-voltage transformer, Billeb said, that is repurposed from a microwave oven to flow currents from jumper cables to the chemically-soaked wood. “This process is highly dangerous, and should only be done by trained professionals,” the deputy chief warned. “Taking advice from YouTube or from any other social media site in order to do a craft item or some other artwork, is not safe when you’re dealing with electricity.” Billeb said the state’s pathology lab had seen similar deadly cases involving the trend before. At least 33 people have died from accidents involving fractal burning, according to the American Association of Woodturners. “It’s very pretty, quite frankly,” Billeb said. “But it should only be done by professionals.” Marathon County is about 105 miles west of Green Bay.",U.S./Kansas City Star,"‘Pretty’ social media trend blamed in mysterious deaths of Wisconsin pair, cops say",https://news.yahoo.com/pretty-social-media-trend-blamed-181053862.html
