1/14/2022,"There was never any chance of getting Rishi Sunak to do it. The chancellor had made it clear he wasn’t going to offer anything but the most half-hearted support. Ideally he wouldn’t be spending any time in the same postcode, let alone the same room, as the PM from now on. But Boris Johnson had been more disappointed in other members of his cabinet. Liz Truss’s phone had gone straight to voicemail. Dominic Raab had called in to say he was exhausted after committing random acts of psychopathic violence to try to offset humiliating himself with a supportive tweet.  Michael Gove had ruled himself out by making himself available to do anything that was required. The last time the Govester had made that kind of offer was when he had been his campaign manager for his 2016 leadership bid. And he knew how that had ended. The man couldn’t be trusted not to betray his own shadow. In the end, there had been only one man left standing. “I need someone with a cunning plan,” Johnson had told Brandon ‘Baldrick’ Lewis, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland. “I am that man,” Lewis had replied. “I have a plan so cunning it will defeat even our most cunning enemies.” Good, then you’ve got the job, Boris had said. So it was that Baldrick came to be sent out to defend the prime minister’s lies on the following morning’s media round. Baldrick first came unstuck when Sky’s Kay Burley made it clear from the off that she thought she was dealing with a halfwit. Though that might have been to overestimate Lewis’s intellectual faculties, as he couldn’t really explain anything very much. He reckoned that Johnson’s boyfriend apology had covered all the bases and been both heartfelt and insincere. Why should he say sorry and mean it when he didn’t think he had done anything wrong? Besides it had been commonplace at the time to use Boris Johnson impersonators – it’s amazing what you can do with a clown in a blond toddler wig – for roleplays in No 10 work meetings, so it was possible the real Boris hadn’t even attended the party. Not that it had been a party, of course. And even if it had been, then the prime minister definitely hadn’t read the email from his principal private secretary about it. We had Johnson’s word for that and what more could you want from a man who has repeatedly lied to wives, friends, parliament and the entire country. That’s what made him such a great leader. Because he wasn’t afraid to take the big decisions on when to lie and when to merely conceal the truth. Bring on the next election and another five years of the Great Dissembler. Err … hang on, said Burley. Back to the party that Boris was unable to tell was a party even though there were trestle tables with food and drink and various staffers were lying face down in the flower beds by the time he turned up. Still that wasn’t a party, said Baldrick. It was just a cunning plan to make it look like a party. Besides, the trestle tables had really been there for spreadsheets. Baldrick’s head was still spinning by the time he had moved studios to Radio 4’s Today programme, where Nick Robinson concluded the dismantling that Burley had started. No one was sorrier than Boris, he said, and instead of being the only person who was in the garden to not recognise that a party was a party, he wished he hadn’t stayed for 25 minutes wondering what work event had been taking place, before conveniently forgetting about the whole thing until details of the party that wasn’t a party had been leaked to the media at the end of last week. It was the insincerity of the apology that made it so sincere. After all, no one would have believed a sincere apology from The Liar. And he had heroically gone to prime minister’s questions, which he was obliged to do, to explain why he hadn’t really done anything wrong. Something he was sure the inquiry would establish as it was being undertaken by Sue Gray, who just happened to be employed by the prime minister and was therefore far from independent. It was all just a huge misunderstanding that could soon be cleared up. Then everyone would be free to have a massive work event to celebrate. With that, Baldrick shrivelled up in a ball and went to hide until the next time he had a cunning plan – he was fortunate not to have any self-respect to lose – and the mantle of Operation Save Our Boris, codename Sob Story, was passed to Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was making the weekly business statement in the Commons. On reflection, Johnson might have wished Jakey had said a little less. In his own mind, the leader of the house is a model of good manners and easy charm: in reality he is a 12-year-old entitled brat in an oversized suit whose default setting is to be patronising and offensive. The very model of passive aggression. After making a point of doubling down on his dismissal of Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Tories in Holyrood, as a lightweight – the reality is that it’s Mogg who is the lightweight – Jakey went on to insult the Welsh. He had done more for the independence movement in five minutes than the Nats had achieved in years. Then Rees-Mogg went still further. It was incumbent on all Tories to support their leader even if he was proved to be a liar and a fraud and Johnson couldn’t be expected to obey the rules as they were far too harsh in the first place. In fact, an intelligent person would have been obliged to break them. That’s what the rest of the country – we little people – who managed to do so were told. There was just one more thing to do for Boris. Draw a second red line on a family member’s lateral flow test. Now he could hide up in Downing Street where no one could get to him for the next five days. And maybe everyone would have forgotten about his lies by the time he got out. Some hope.",News/Politics,The PM’s predicament seemed hopeless.

1/14/2022,"The rebellion by Scottish Tories over Boris Johnson’s leadership erupted into open warfare on Thursday after it emerged the prime minister would not be invited to speak at the party’s spring conference. The unprecedented snub, confirmed by several sources, came after Jacob Rees-Mogg was bitterly criticised for attacking the character of the Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, on Wednesday night.  Senior Conservatives in Scotland said the leader of the House of Commons had boosted the Scottish National party and undermined the union after he dismissed Ross as a “lightweight” and serial rebel following his call for the prime minister to quit. Scottish Tories were furious, accusing Rees-Mogg of being “pathetic” and urged him to “have a long lie down”. Rees-Mogg refused to back down on Thursday, stating: “If you take the king’s shilling you are beholden to the crown.” With nearly all 31 Scottish Tory MSPs publicly supporting Ross’s call for Johnson to quit, several sources said it was “inconceivable” that the prime minister would now appear at Scottish party conference in March – the first time a UK leader has been barred from doing so. The event was still being planned but one source said: “I don’t see a way he could be invited really.” The Tories’ discomfort over Rees-Mogg’s attacks was exposed when Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish National party leader and first minister, said his remarks illustrated the Conservatives’ “utter contempt” for Scotland. “If they can’t even show basic respect for their own colleagues, what chance do the rest of us have?” Sturgeon concluded that independence would have the “added benefit no longer [having] to put up with being treated like something on the sole of Westminster’s shoe and I suspect even Douglas Ross finds that a really attractive proposition”. Speaking in the House of Commons, Pete Wishart, the SNP’s shadow leader of the house, goaded Rees-Mogg. “The Scottish Tories are supposed to be the Praetorian guard of the precious union, and the leader of the house has just undermined them, thrown them under the proverbial bus,” Wishart said. “If this is how the government even treats the Scottish Tories, why should the Scottish people entertain being a part of their useless union?” Ross told reporters Rees-Mogg was entitled to his opinions. “I don’t have to agree with them,” he said. “My message [to him] is I’m going to hold the first minister to account, and ensure the Scottish Conservatives continue to provide that real alternative here in Scotland.” Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, distanced himself from Rees-Mogg’s attacks by telling the BBC that all his Scottish Tory colleagues, including Ross, were “held in high regard” at Westminster. But Jack said Ross and his colleagues had “jumped the gun” by calling for Johnson to resign after the prime minister acknowledged attending the No 10 garden party on 20 May 2020, in defiance of a UK-wide ban on gatherings. Jack implied that an internal inquiry led by Sue Gray, a senior civil servant, which many Tory MPs are waiting for before deciding whether Johnson should stay, would clear the prime minister of breaching the rules. “Then they may reconsider their position,” Jack said. “But let’s wait. They need to see the full facts.” Scottish Tory leaders often reject UK government policy, pursuing distinctive devolved policies for Holyrood, and there was open disagreement about Brexit strategy after the 2016 EU referendum. However, despite Rees-Mogg’s attempt to single out Ross, the scale of the Scottish Tory rebellion against Johnson is unprecedented. Jack is the only one of six Scottish Tory MPs and 31 MSPs to openly back the prime minister; three successive Scottish Tory leaders – Ruth Davidson, Jackson Carlaw and Ross, have now called on him to quit. Jack’s four other Westminster colleagues are thought to share Ross’s anxieties, and some, furious with his leadership and conduct believe the prime minister is unlikely to survive. They are waiting to see whether any other scandals about Johnson’s conduct come to light and for Gray to complete her investigation before deciding whether to back calls for him to resign, to avoid fuelling a failed rebellion. Andrew Bowie, the MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, said: “I do not believe the [prime minister’s] apology was enough. However, I think it’s important to wait and see what the report says.” An hour before Sturgeon’s attack on Rees-Mogg at Holyrood, the UK government announced a “landmark agreement” setting out how the UK and devolved governments will work together “based upon on the existing values of mutual respect, maintaining trust and positive working”. This post-Brexit upgrade of the joint ministerial committee set up by the Labour government in 1999 has been spearheaded by Michael Gove. He said it would build on “the incredible amount of collaboration already taking place between the UK government and the devolved administrations”.",News/Politics," Boris Johnson will not be invited to Scottish Tory conference, sources say",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/boris-johnson-will-not-be-invited-to-scottish-tory-conference-sources-say
1/14/2022,"The prime minister’s excuse about the May 2020 party is utterly pathetic (Boris Johnson’s future on a knife edge after No 10 party apology, 12 January). The rules in May 2020 were clear regarding the meeting of people outside your household. The specific rules relating to work were also clear – if people couldn’t work from home, “workers should try to minimise all meetings and other gatherings” and “only absolutely necessary participants should attend meetings and should maintain 2m separation throughout”. In addition, we were told to “reduce the number of people you spend time with in a work setting”. Clearly Boris Johnson and all those who took part in No 10 gatherings think rules are for bending. Now it appears that the PM is waiting for the investigation to finish to see if his skin can be saved. It should not be left to a civil servant to determine his future – the 1922 Committee must get a grip and get rid of the man now if they want to have any chance of a future with their electorate.Ailsa ClarkeFreeland, Oxfordshire   I am heartbroken, remembering 16 June 2020 when my beloved younger sister died suddenly (not Covid-related). Only two people were allowed to be with her at the end of her life until doctors pronounced her dead – her husband and elder daughter were those two. I had to sit in the hospital car park for hours, not able to be with my only sister while she was dying. This was not the only agony. The agony of deciding a short guest list for the funeral; the agony of those who wanted to come but didn’t, as they were vulnerable or shielding others who were vulnerable. The social distancing rules that prevented us hugging and crying together at funerals. It was all horrendous. These were the rules to safeguard us all in the first months of lockdown and now we are learning of yet more contemptuous rule-breaking by those who made them. I am full of contempt for the prime minister who lies brazenly, and he and his ilk who hold us all in such contempt. They are despicable. Our country deserves, and needs, better than them.Hilary HuntWelford, Northamptonshire  As someone who has voted Conservative in every election since 1970, I am finally forced to say: “Enough is enough.” Heath, Thatcher, Hague, Duncan Smith, Howard, Cameron, May – each had strengths and weaknesses, but each was a politician I could regard as honest and honourable. Boris Johnson is neither. I supported him in the leadership election because I wanted to “get Brexit done”. Even when he achieved that by shamelessly betraying the Ulster Unionists and the British fishermen, I went along with the “ah well, compromises are inevitable” excuses. But now, knowing what he and his inner circle were up to, as they told the rest of us we were not allowed to comfort our sick and dying for fear of spreading the virus, makes my stomach turn. One day I will probably return to the Conservative fold, but only when the party has a leader I can respect.Francis BownLondon  No one seems to have asked the question that I want to know the answer to: if these were work meetings at 10 Downing Street, why was Carrie Johnson there?

1/14/2022,"The lack of detail in Michael Gove’s proposal to make developers pay for unsafe cladding is instructive (Report, 10 January). His statements beg far more questions than answers. How will unsafe cladding be defined and who will have that responsibility? If insulation is a primary concern, to what insulation standards will new cladding need to be installed and who will monitor the quality of the remedial work? How will “developer” be defined, and why pick on developers? Assuming it is possible to define the problem with precision, there will be a natural instinct to share the blame: the builder? Product suppliers? Subcontractors? Client? Building regulations? The government? The Grenfell Tower inquiry is into its fifth year without any specific conclusions about responsibility or blame for the disaster. Gove’s announcement is a recipe for further confusion, bankruptcy and endless litigation.

1/14/2022,"I was disappointed by Dave Green’s letter (12 January) regarding the penalties he suggests for those who are unvaccinated. I can empathise with his words as a previous cancer patient myself, and also as a frontline nurse, but I disagree with his judgment on “anti-vaxxers”. Those who have chosen not to have the vaccine do not all share the same mindset, and it is worth bearing this in mind before they are all excommunicated from society. My adult son is autistic and is unvaccinated by choice. His belief system may differ from most people’s, but as he is housebound due to crippling anxiety, hopefully he will not be much of a risk to himself or others. Let’s be civilised enough not to alienate him further. Of course, he might have chosen to forgo the Covid vaccine without the complexities of an autism diagnosis, but we cannot punish those who are fearful or those who wish to preserve their self-determination.  There are other groups of people who take up hospital beds and who are judged as selfish by some due to lifestyle choices too. Where should we draw the line?

1/14/2022,"Local memorials as markers of Britain’s slave past are indeed important, and it is wonderful that the Captured Africans memorial in Lancaster was highlighted (Letters, 11 January). The Lancaster Black History Group was formed in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 and is working with community groups such as the Priory church, where many black slaves were baptised in the 18th century, to create a range of markers of this troubled history. Crucially, the work highlights runaway Africans whose agency in escaping bondage is now being discovered, including an Ibo boy (unnamed) in 1765 who spoke “broad Lancashire dialect”. Such work is vital to reveal hitherto hidden histories, and is available as a new map on the Visit Lancaster website. I know of local campaigns and trails from Cromarty to Norwich and from Bath to Birmingham.
