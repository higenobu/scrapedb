3/19/2022,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh CHICAGO (Reuters) - General Electric Co on Thursday said its Chief Executive Larry Culp would take a 67% cut to an incentive grant this year after shareholders last year rejected his compensation package in a non-binding but rare rebuke over executive pay. In its annual proxy statement filed on Thursday, the Boston-based industrial conglomerate said Culp's annual equity incentive grant for 2022 will be reduced to $5 million from $15 million. The company also disclosed Culp's annual compensation last year was about $22.7 million, down 69% from 2020, due to a reduction in stock awards. Proxy votes against executive pay at S&P 500 companies became more common last year and were often sparked by ""questionable practices and metrics,"" such as easier performance targets during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report by shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. Among the S&P 500, a record 16 companies had the pay of their CEOs and other top leaders rejected by more than half of investors last year, up from 10 in 2020 and seven in 2019, the report said. As part of an extension of Culp's employment contract to 2024, GE in 2020 canceled old shares he had been given and granted him new shares tied to lower financial targets. The compensation package entailed a payout through 2024 of as much as $230 million. Some 57.7% of GE shareholders last year rejected the pay deal, according to preliminary results, which some proxy advisory firms argued was too generous. GE said in the proxy statement its board had gathered feedback from shareholders on the issue and tried to address concerns related to compensation matters. While defending the 2020 grant, the company said its board does not intend to enter into a similar modification of the CEO's employment agreement in the future. It also promised to use discretion sparingly in determining bonus pools. GE's annual shareholders meeting is scheduled in May.

3/19/2022,"Nearly 30 companies are ""digging in,"" defying public demands to exit Russia or reduce their activities in the pariah state, according to a list kept by a professor with the Yale School of Management. Among those operating undeterred: Authentic Brands' Reebok, Halliburton, Koch Industries, LG Electronics, and Subway, which has nearly 450 franchised locations in Russia. The list, launched several days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is ""updated continuously"" by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, and his research team in a bid to ""reflect new announcements from companies in as close to real time as possible."" On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Kansas-based Koch Industries ""will continue to operate its two glass manufacturing facilities in Russia,"" citing a Wednesday statement from Koch President and COO Dave Robertson that acknowledged the decision, affecting about 600 Guardian Industries employees. ""We have no other physical assets in Russia, and outside of Guardian, employ 15 individuals in the country,"" Robertson wrote. ""While Guardian's business in Russia is a very small part of Koch, we will not walk away from our employees there or hand over these manufacturing facilities to the Russian government so it can operate and benefit from them (which is what The Wall Street Journal has reported they would do)."" ""Doing so would only put our employees there at greater risk and do more harm than good."" Since the initial publication of the list during the week of Feb. 28, Sonnenfeld and fellow researchers have revised their categorization method. In a March 16 article for Fortune, Sonnenfeld acknowledged that the initial ""naughty and nice list ... smoothed over some of the complexities related to these companies' exits from Russia."" The revised list includes four categories: ""withdrawing all business,"" ""suspending operations,"" ""reducing activities,"" and ""economic collaboration."" There is no excuse for companies in the fourth, last, category, Sonnenfeld wrote for Fortune, which fell from 34 businesses Wednesday to 27 Thursday. ""Worst of all are the companies in category #4 that continue in Russia unabated,"" he wrote. ""Oil servicers such as Halliburton and Schlumberger remain economic collaborators despite U.S. sanction. I met Jean Riboud, the legendary former Schlumberger CEO who over several decades built Schlumberger into being the largest in the industry, a company that under his leadership was considered the best managed firm in the world. A Buchenwald Holocaust survivor and fighter in the resistance against the Nazis, Riboud, who died in 1985, would not recognize his firm today."" Those 27 companies ""defying demands for exit or reduction of activities,"" as of Thursday, per Sonnenfeld's list: Accor Air Products Asus Auchan Authentic Brands Group - Reebok Baker Hughes BBDO Group Cargill Cloudflare DDB Decathlon Greif Gruma Halliburton International Paper IPG Photonics Koch Industries Leroy Merlin LG Electronics Metro Nalco Natura and Company Omnicom Media Group Oriflame Cosmetics Pirelli Schlumberger Subway Young Living One-hundred and fifty companies have made what Sonnenfeld calls a ""clean break/surgical removal/resection"" from Russia as of March 17. They include: Activision Blizzard Airbnb Alaska Airlines Aldi American Airlines Bumble Deloitte Delta Air Lines Exxon FIFA Formula One Nasdaq Netflix Radio Free Europe Swarovski TJ Maxx TripAdvisor Uber United Airlines One hundred and eighty companies were ""keeping options open for return as of March 17, according to the list.
