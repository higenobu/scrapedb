12/23/2021,"Diogo Jota sealed Liverpool’s place in the Carabao Cup semi-finals following a rousing fightback and penalty shootout win over Leicester. Brendan Rodgers has never won at Anfield since leaving the club six years ago and Leicester had not won here since 2000. They may never get a better chance.  The visitors were comfortably in the ascendency after two Jamie Vardy strikes and a stunning effort from James Maddison gave them a 3-1 half-time lead. But a determined Liverpool response, led by the substitute Jota and completed by Takumi Minamino’s injury-time equaliser, transformed the quarter-final in the second half and ensured it was decided via a shootout. Liverpool’s reserve goalkeeper, Caoimhin Kelleher, saved twice from Luke Thomas and Ryan Bertrand. Minamino blazed over what could have been the winning spot-kick for the hosts but, following Bertrand’s weak attempt, Jota punished Leicester once more. The approach taken by the former and current Liverpool managers had an early impact on the tie and on the threat posed by their respective sides in particular. Liverpool errors in the build-up to two Vardy goals in four minutes also contributed to the rueful smile on Klopp’s face. Klopp handed a first senior start to Billy Koumetio and included the French central defender’s fellow teenagers Tyler Morton and Conor Bradley in a line-up that featured ten changes to Sunday’s starting XI at Tottenham. Even without positive Covid tests ruling out Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho, Thiago Alcãntara and Curtis Jones, it was a selection that might have been expected from the Liverpool manager given the circumstances, the schedule ahead and where the Carabao Cup figures on his list of priorities. Rodgers went much stronger, despite the Covid issues that had forced the postponement of Leicester’s last two Premier League games against Tottenham and Everton. He was repaid with an penetrating performance that should have produced a healthier half-time lead against an uncertain Liverpool defence. Leicester cut through with their first attack. It was instigated, along with several others, by a wayward Liverpool pass. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall intercepted Joe Gomez’s telegraphed ball out of defence and sent Patson Daka sprinting away from the England international. Kelleher, standing-in for Alisson, stood up to save at his near post. But he was easily beaten when the visitors raided again. This time Kostas Tsimikas gave away possession cheaply, finding Boubakary Soumaré instead of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain as he attempted to break down the wing, and left his full-back position badly exposed. Soumaré exchanged passes with Ricardo Pereira before finding Maddison. The midfielder released Vardy with a delightful first-time ball and the veteran struck a clean, low finish beyond Kelleher into the far corner. Vardy did not have to wait long to add to his 10th goal of the season. Leicester again attacked with speed and precision when Neco Williams lost possession to Dewsbury-Hall. He found Daka in space on the left for a second time and, as Koumetio closed down the space, the striker threaded a perfect ball behind the Liverpool defence for the unmarked Vardy to convert a convincing finish past Kelleher from close range. Tsimikas made amends for his costly mistake when creating Liverpool’s swift response through Oxlade-Chamberlain. The Greece international flicked the ball over the head of Pereira, who was injured by a poor early foul from Morton and eventually forced off, and crossed deep for Williams to head into the path of Roberto Firmino. Liverpool’s fit-again centre-forward heeded the midfielder’s appeals for a pass to the edge of the penalty area and Oxlade-Chamberlain swept a fine shot into Kasper Schmeichel’s bottom right-hand corner. The contest was wide open. The impressive Dewsbury-Hall denied Takumi Minamino inside the area with a solid challenge after Firmino had dispossessed Soumaré and sent the Japan international through on goal. Vardy created a chance for his hat-trick when bursting through Liverpool’s soft defensive centre. Only the alertness of Morton, who blocked the striker’s run and drew a foul, stopped him. But seconds later Leicester had their third. Maddison got a fortunate bounce of the ball when, collecting a pass from Dewsbury-Hall, he rode a challenge from Oxlade-Chamberlain. There was nothing fortuitous about the shot that followed. Glancing up from 25 yards out, the midfielder connected superbly to find the roof of the net from distance. It was a sweet, powerful effort but also straight down the middle of Kelleher’s goal, and the keeper’s reaction suggested he knew he should have done better. Vardy almost made it four before the break when Gomez, making his first start since the fourth round win over Preston on 27 October, let a routine pass from Morton slip by. The Leicester forward pounced in an instant and, despite beating Kelleher once again, his low shot cannoned off the inside of the far post before being cleared by Gomez. Klopp injected greater experience into his team with a triple half-time substitution and Liverpool’s cause was also helped by injuries to an already depleted visiting defence. Caglar Soyuncu joined Pereira on the injury list after stretching to block a Firmino shot. His replacement in what was now a five-man Leicester rearguard, Jannik Vestergaard, brought nothing like the same authority. Jota, one of the three second-half introductions, lifted Anfield with a clinical shot beyond Schmeichel when released behind the Leicester defence by Minamino. He had another chance blocked in a goalmouth scramble and an instinctive header on a Naby Keïta drive saved superbly by Schmeichel before Minamino salvaged a shootout. There was six minutes of injury time being played when James Milner lifted a deep cross into the Leicester area. Wilfred Ndidi missed his clearing header and Minamino made no mistake on the half volley.",Sport/Football,Liverpool beat Leicester on penalties after Carabao Cup quarter-final thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/22/liverpool-leicester-carabao-cup-quarter-final-match-report
12/23/2021,"Perhaps Chelsea’s personnel problems have been overstated. After all their complaints about the schedule felt slightly overblown when Thomas Tuchel, searching for a way to turn this Carabao Cup quarter-final, looked at his bench with 14 minutes left and told N’Golo Kanté to get ready. It turns out that Tuchel, who had already introduced Jorginho, Christian Pulisic, Mason Mount and Reece James, was fibbing when he said that Kanté would play no part against Brentford. Or perhaps he had a late change of heart. Either way the gamble was worth it. It was an exceptional cameo from Kanté, who started the move that led to Pontus Jansson’s game-changing own goal, and Chelsea were through to the last four when added a late penalty.  It was strange to think that Chelsea arguably came into this derby as underdogs. After all there was no way of knowing how a team featuring three teenage debutants would fare against opponents as awkward and physical as Brentford. The risks were clear and there is no doubt that Tuchel, who was without nine players because of injuries and Covid, would have preferred to wait rather than throw the kids in at the deep end. Nonetheless this was an opportunity for Chelsea to demonstrate why they have invested so much energy and money into their academy, which is now one of the best in the world. The next generation have seen talents like Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi and James establish themselves in the first team in the last two years and there was a clear sense of confidence to the way the youngsters acquitted themselves during a tight opening period, particularly when the gifted Harvey Vale got on the ball in the final third. Vale, who turned 18 in September, is tipped to the next big star at Chelsea. The attacking midfielder has a fearless streak to his game and there was a flash of his promise when he helped make Chelsea’s first opening. The link play with Jude Soonsup-Bell was sharp and the cross was inviting, only for Ross Barkley to screw a poor volley wide at the far post. Arsenal v LiverpoolChelsea v Tottenham Two-legged ties to be played in the weeks beginning 3 and 10 January That was a warning for Brentford to take Chelsea seriously. Inevitably, though, there were moments when the young trio looked callow. Soonsup-Bell, only 17, was pushed off the ball too often during the first half and Vale should have done better with a free header just before the break. At right wing-back, meanwhile, Xavier Simons often had his hands full with Brentford’s rampaging left wing-back, Rico Henry. Brentford, who also had selection issues after being forced to postpone their game against Southampton last weekend, soon settled into an encouraging rhythm. Henry’s driving runs were causing problems for Chelsea and the opening goal should have arrived when Bryan Mbeumo lifted a cross to the far post. Somehow Yoane Wissa, who was six yards from goal, headed too close to Kepa Arrizabalaga. Chelsea’s goalkeeper would be called upon again before the interval. Arrizabalaga flung himself to his left to claw out a header from the elegant midfielder, Mathias Jensen, and he was also quickly out to deny Henry when the wing-back peeled behind Simons. Chelsea’s vulnerabilities were unsurprising. Any team would not be quite as sharp without Ben Chilwell, Andreas Christensen, Kai Havertz, Hudson-Odoi, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Romelu Lukaku, Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech. Tuchel had to experiment and although Chelsea were composed in possession during the first half, it was obvious that they needed more incision. The interval offered Tuchel a chance to strategise. Pulisic came on for Soonsup-Bell, Mateo Kovacic made way for Jorginho after making his first start since October and suddenly Chelsea looked more like themselves, pushing Brentford back at the start of the second half and creating openings. Brentford had lost their impetus. Jorginho was pulling the strings in midfield and the opening goal almost arrived when Saúl Ñíguez, making only his sixth start since joining on loan from Atlético Madrid, crossed from the left. Álvaro Fernández, who would also save well from Barkley, had to react quickly to stop Henry scoring an own goal. The pressure grew when Mount, James and Kanté replaced Vale, Simons and the ineffective Barkley. Kanté was untouchable. The midfielder kept finding gaps and he made the difference four minutes after his introduction, driving into space and finding James, whose fierce cross was diverted in by Jansson. The game was safe when two more substitutes combined. Pulisic ran clear before being fouled by Fernández and Jorginho sealed victory from the spot.

12/23/2021,"Antonio Conte has had one route to cup glory unceremoniously closed off this week. The Tottenham manager was never going to allow another one to follow suit. The Italian remains furious at how his club’s Europa Conference League campaign ended on Monday – in the forfeiting of the final group phase tie, amid a Covid outbreak in the dressing-room – and he wants a solution via the courts.  His players got the job done in more conventional fashion here, responding to his touchline urgings to secure a frantic derby victory. Roared on by 5,700 travelling fans, West Ham played a full part in a proper cup tie, Jarrod Bowen – who scored a fabulous equaliser – in fine form and the captain, Declan Rice, a remorseless driving presence. Neither deserved to be on the losing team. But it is Spurs who advance to the Carabao Cup semi-finals and they have one of their forgotten men to thank. The lesser-spotted Steven Bergwijn came to life in the first half, scoring the opener and laying on what proved to be the winner for Lucas Moura. West Ham, the dominant force for long spells, fought until the end and at the death, the substitute Andriy Yarmolenko saw Hugo Lloris claw away a shot that deflected and looped towards the far corner. It was not West Ham’s night. Tottenham are playing with a greater intensity under Conte. They are running further, according to the statistics, and they look better set to play in their attacking runners behind opposing defences, their interchanges slicker. Arsenal v LiverpoolChelsea v Tottenham Two-legged ties to be played in the weeks beginning 3 and 10 January This what David Moyes’s players had to guard against and they were almost unpicked early on when Lucas spun away from Issa Diop and shaped a wonderful low throughball around Craig Dawson for Harry Kane. The angle was tight and Kane did not make the most powerful of connections with his left foot. Alphonse Areola, West Ham’s cup goalkeeper, made the save. The first half was high octane and action-packed, both teams committed to attack, and Bergwijn was the central figure. Starting his first game under Conte and his first for Spurs since 27 October, the winger had been a mixed bag early on, his touch a little heavy, his radar awry. It all changed in the 29th minute when Pierre-Emile Højbjerg accepted a lay-off from him and drove up the right-hand side of the box. The midfielder might have shot but, instead, he played a lovely pass back inside with disguise for Bergwijn to finish from close range. West Ham had started brightly, with Bowen working Lloris from a free-kick and seeing another effort blocked by Davinson Sánchez. Bowen’s quick feet were a delight and his team reacted superbly to the setback. Twice Tomas Soucek tested Lloris with headers – the first one, when he towered above Sánchez, fully extending the goalkeeper – and Dawson also blew a free header from a Bowen corner. The equaliser came at the end of a remorseless spell of West Ham pressure. Eric Dier, talked up pre-match by Conte as having the ability to be the best in the world in the middle of a back three, gave the ball away and, when West Ham worked it back into the area through Nikola Vlasic, Bowen threw Dier with a deft trick before shooting low past Lloris. Back came Spurs and it was an excellent piece of skill from Bergwijn that took him past Manuel Lanzini. With no tackle from either Arthur Masuaku or Diop, Bergwijn crossed for Lucas to jab home, Areola going down too slowly. It was all too easy from a West Ham point of view. Moyes had been discomfited by Michail Antonio’s positive Covid test and could also point to being without his first-choice defence – the suspended Vladimir Coufal and the injured Angelo Ogbonna, Kurt Zouma and Aaron Cresswell. Moyes had to adapt and Bowen certainly answered the call, either through the middle or off the right, where he operated in the second-half. If it had felt edgy on Tottenham High Road before kick-off – scuffles breaking out between the two sets of supporters;, the riot police highly visible – it was lively and physical on the field, the tackles flying in with feeling from the first whistle. Bergwijn could have finished the first half with a hat-trick, having been too quick for Dawson following a Matt Doherty cross only for the defender to then pick his pocket. Earlier, the excellent Oliver Skipp had stuck out a leg to deny Soucek at the far post. West Ham pressed on to the front foot at the start of the second period, Bowen continuing to menace, going close with a header and also when he chased a high ball in on Lloris. Conte had to respond and his move on the hour was the introduction of Harry Winks and Son Heung-min, and a switch from 3-4-2-1 to 3-5-2. Moyes’s 3-4-3 posed plenty of questions. He introduced Pablo Fornals as a false nine, with Bowen and another substitute, Saïd Benrahma, either side of him and West Ham pushed until the last. Benrahma had a clutch of openings but Spurs held firm to book an intriguing semi-final clash with Conte’s former club, Chelsea.",Sport/Football,Lucas Moura goal decisive as Spurs dig in to see off West Ham in Carabao Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/22/tottenham-west-ham-carabao-cup-quarter-final-match-report
12/23/2021,"For many Democrats, Joe Manchin has become an unshakeable problem. The centrist senator is at odds with other Democrats on everything from filibuster reform to climate policy, and he recently announced his opposition to the Build Back Better Act, the lynchpin of Joe Biden’s legislative agenda. But Republicans think Manchin now represents an opportunity to boost their numbers.  As Democrats have leveled fierce criticism at the West Virginia senator in the past few days, Republicans have resurrected their campaign to recruit him to their party. The stakes of this charm offensive could not be higher. With the Senate split 50-50, Manchin’s party change would give Republicans the majority. If Republicans take control of the Senate, they would have the ability to block Biden’s nominees and quash Democratic bills. Speaking to the New York Times on Tuesday, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, reiterated his invitiation to Manchin to join the Republican caucus. “Obviously we would love to have him on our team,” McConnell said. “I think he’d be more comfortable.” The Republican senator John Cornyn said he also texted Manchin on Tuesday to tell him: “Joe, if they don’t want you we do.” Cornyn told the NBC affiliate KXAN that he had not heard back from Manchin, but he said a change in Senate control would be “the greatest Christmas gift I can think of”. Manchin has not given any indication that he is seriously considering switching parties. In a Monday interview with West Virginia Radio, Manchin said he believed there was still room in the Democratic party for someone with his views. “I would like to hope that there are still Democrats that feel like I do,” Manchin said. “I’m socially – I’m fiscally responsible and socially compassionate.” He added: “Now, if there’s no Democrats like that, then they’ll have to push me wherever they want me.” Manchin has been even more pointed in the past when asked about his party identity. After a report emerged in October that he was seriously considering leaving the Democratic party, he dismissed the news as “bullshit”. But he acknowledged he had previously offered to change his party affiliation to “independent” if his views ever became an “embarrassment” for Biden or other Senate Democrats. “I said, me being a moderate centrist Democrat — if that causes you a problem, let me know and I’d switch to be independent,” Manchin said in October. At the time, none of Manchin’s Democratic colleagues took him up on the offer, although some may now be tempted to do so. When Manchin announced he would oppose Build Back Better, after he had already demanded major changes to the spending package to limit its size and scope, some congressional Democrats sounded ready to abandon their colleague. “It’s unfortunate that it seems we can’t trust Senator Manchin’s word,” Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said on Monday. “We’re not going to wait for one man to decide on one day that he’s with us, and on the other day that he’s not.” For McConnell, that is an opening to try to wrest back control of the Senate. “Why in the world would they want to call him a liar and try to hotbox him and embarrass him?” McConnell told the Times. “I think the message is, ‘We don’t want you around.’ Obviously that is up to Joe Manchin, but he is clearly not welcome on that side of the aisle.”",News/US news,Republicans woo Joe Manchin as senator clashes with Democrats,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/22/joe-manchin-democrats-republicans-party
