1/22/2022,"SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) — The University of Rhode Island is revoking honorary degrees bestowed upon two once-prominent advisers to former President Donald Trump: retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The university's board of trustees voted Friday to revoke the degrees following internal deliberations that included a recommendation by URI President Marc Parlange. The president said in a statement that Flynn and Giuliani “no longer represent” the values and standards they demonstrated when they first received the honors. “As a civic institution, URI has the privilege and responsibility to sustain and preserve American democracy by inspiring and modeling good citizenship,” Parlange said. “Revoking these honorary degrees reinforces our values and allows us to lead with truth and integrity.” Giuliani, who served as one of Trump’s top legal advisers, was awarded the Doctor of Laws Honoris Causa in 2003 based on his leadership in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to URI. Flynn, who briefly served as Trump’s national security adviser before resigning following reports he misled Trump officials about his contacts with Russia, was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters in 2014. Messages seeking comment were left Friday with a spokesperson for Giuliani and a member of Flynn's family in Rhode Island. The university board cited a number of findings by URI's honorary degree committee, which is made up of faculty, staff and students, that led to its decision. For Flynn, it noted, among other things, that he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The Rhode Island native and 1981 URI graduate was pardoned by Trump in 2020. For Giuliani, the university concluded that his words “encouraged domestic terrorist behavior” that led to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. It also noted he has been suspended from practicing law in the District of Columbia and New York for making “unfounded claims of rampant fraud during the 2020 presidential election.”",U.S./Associated Press,University revokes honorary degrees for Giuliani and Flynn,https://news.yahoo.com/university-revokes-honorary-degrees-giuliani-183524859.html
1/22/2022,"Gabby Petito's family said FBI evidence leaves ""no doubt"" that her fiancé Brian Laundrie ""murdered"" her. Petito's body was discovered at a remote campsite in Wyoming on September 19. She was stranged to death. Laundrie's remains were found in Florida a month later. He died by suicide. Gabby Petito's family said on Friday that evidence gathered by the FBI leaves ""no doubt"" that the young woman's fiancé Brian Laundrie — who was the sole person of interest in connection to Petito's disappearance — ""murdered"" her. ""We truly appreciate the FBI's diligent and painstaking efforts in this extremely complicated case,"" Richard Stafford, an attorney representing Petito's family, said in a statement. The statement added, ""The quality and quantity of facts and information collected by the FBI leave no doubt [that] Brian Laundrie murdered Gabby."" Petito's family met with the FBI at its Tampa office on Thursday, the FBI told Insider on Friday. ""We will be issuing a final statement shortly as our investigation will be coming to a close in the near future,"" the FBI said. An attorney for Laundrie's family declined to comment to Insider on Friday. Petito's body was discovered at a remote campsite in Wyoming on September 19. She and Laundrie had embarked on a cross-country road trip out West in a converted camper van last summer, documenting their travels on social media along the way. A coroner determined Petito, 22, was strangled to death. Laundrie vanished nearly two weeks after he returned from the trip to the Florida home the couple shared with his parents without Petito on September 1. His skeletal remains were discovered on October 20 near his backpack at Florida's vast Carlton Reserve. He died by suicide, a medical examiner found. Laundrie, 23, was never charged in connection to Petito's killing. A US district court issued an arrest warrant for Laundrie on a charge related to bank card fraud in September, and he was the subject of a massive FBI-led manhunt before his remains were discovered. In Stafford's statement on Friday, he noted that Petito's family thanked the FBI, including its Wyoming, Denver, New York, and Tampa offices, ""all of their task force members and their assisting agencies."" ""Victim Services has been there for support from the earliest stages of this investigation and helped their entire family navigate through the worst moments of their lives,"" Stafford said. Meanwhile, Laundrie family attorney Steven Bertolino told Insider on Thursday that the Laundries and the Petito family reached an agreement about the couple's leftover property, which includes their belongings that the FBI currently has, as well as their belongings at the North Port, Florida, home where they lived. ""An agreement in principle with respect to the distribution of property between the families has been reached,"" Bertolino said at the time.

1/22/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — Michael Avenatti, the once high-profile California attorney who regularly taunted then-President Donald Trump during frequent television appearances, was introduced Thursday to prospective jurors who will decide whether he cheated porn star Stormy Daniels out of book-deal proceeds. Jury selection hit full stride a week after written questionnaires were filled out as U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman introduced over 60 prospective jurors to Avenatti and the lawyers on both sides who will present evidence during a trial projected to last up to a month. He asked Avenatti and the lawyers to briefly take off their COVID-19 masks so prospective jurors could see their faces and make sure they don't know them from their private lives. Some jurors were in a courthouse assembly room while others watched the judge by video in a ceremonial courtroom. Everyone was spaced apart to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Among 49 questions presented to possible jurors was one in which they were asked if they could be fair even after hearing evidence that Daniels once worked in the ""pornography profession."" The prospective jurors made it to the Manhattan courthouse despite a morning storm. Late in the day, the judge instructed about 40 of them to return on Friday for the final step in the jury selection process, when lawyers on both sides can eliminate some individuals from a jury of 12 people without providing a reason. Once chosen, the jurors will hear opening statements on Monday before they hear and see evidence to help them decide whether Avenatti cheated Daniels out of hundreds of thousands of dollars owed to Daniels from a book deal. Lawyers for Avenatti, 50, have said he is likely to testify in the case. He has pleaded not guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft charges. Avenatti became well known in 2018 when he represented Daniels in lawsuits against Trump. He was treated so well in some circles that he considered running for president himself before federal prosecutors in New York and Los Angeles announced criminal charges against him in separate cases. In early 2020, Avenatti was convicted by a jury of trying to extort up to $25 million from Nike and was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison, though he has not yet begun serving that sentence. Besides the trial over book proceeds, Avenatti also faces a retrial in California on federal charges alleging that he stole millions of dollars in settlement money from his clients. His first trial ended in a mistrial in August.",U.S./Associated Press,Jury selection proceeds for Avenatti-Stormy Daniels trial,https://news.yahoo.com/jury-selection-proceeds-avenatti-stormy-235247958.html
