1/11/2022,"Fox News’ White House correspondent and perpetual nemesis of Jen Psaki thought he had Joe Biden’s press secretary cornered on Monday when he asked her why the president is still referring to COVID-19 as a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” when so many people are getting breakthrough infections. He was wrong. “I understand that the science says that vaccines prevent death,” Doocy began, before undercutting that basic truth. “But I’m triple-vaxxed, still got COVID. You’re triple-vaxxed, still got COVID. Why is the president still referring to this as a pandemic of the unvaccinated?” Liz Cheney Torches Trump on Fox News Noting that she had “minor symptoms” when she tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination, Psaki calmly explained, “There is a huge difference between that and being unvaccinated.” And she came armed with the stats to back up her point. “You are 17 times more likely to go to the hospital if you’re not vaccinated, 20 times more likely to die,” she added. “So yes, the impact for people who are unvaccinated is far more dire than for those who are vaccinated.” As Media Matters’ news director John Whitehouse highlighted on Twitter after the exchange, Doocy’s question was particularly inane because it came just a few days after his own father, Steve Doocy, answered it for him on Fox & Friends despite the protestations of his dimmer, anti-vaxxer co-hosts. Quoting his doctor, Steve Doocy said that it helps to “think of the vaccine as like wearing a kevlar vest.” It may not “stop a bullet” from hitting you, “but it won't let the bullet kill you.” “And that's why I trust the doctors. I trust the science,” he continued. “You know, it’s the only game we’ve got right now is to get vaccinated and boosted.

1/11/2022,"A federal judge dismissed Trump's lawyer's claim that he urged supporters to be peaceful on January 6. ""Let's stick with the facts,"" Judge Amit Mehta told Trump's lawyer, Jesse Binnall. Mehta added that he wasn't interested in ""whataboutism"" and other hypotheticals. A federal judge on Monday forced lawyers for Donald Trump to reckon with his hours of silence during the January 6 attack on the Capitol, asking in court whether the president's initial inaction could be considered a tacit endorsement of the day's violence. US District Judge Amit Mehta also rejected Trump's lawyer's claim that he urged his supporters to be peaceful on January 6, reminding the lawyer to ""stick with the facts."" During a court hearing Monday, Mehta noted that, for a ""two-hour period"" on January 6, Trump did not ""take to Twitter or to any other type of communication and say, 'Stop, get out of the Capitol. What you are doing is not what I wanted you to do.'"" ""What would you have me do with the allegation that the president did not act?"" asked Mehta, an Obama appointee who joined the federal bench in 2014. Mehta's question came during oral arguments over a trio of civil lawsuits, filed by House Democrats and Capitol police officers, alleging that Trump's incendiary rhetoric incited the Capitol breach. At a rally that preceded the Capitol siege, Trump told his supporters, ""If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore."" In court Monday, Mehta asked whether Trump's inaction could be considered ""ratification"" that agreement. Trump's lawyer, Jesse Binnall, pushed back against the assertion that the former president could face legal consequences for action he didn't take. ""The president cannot be subject to judicial action for any sort of damages for failing to do something,"" Binnall said. Binnall argued that the president told his supporters to ""peacefully and patriotically"" make their voices heard on January 6. But that statement was outweighed, Mehta said, by Trump's earlier calls to ""fight like hell"" against the 2020 election results. Mehta said there was no doubt ""threats"" and ""intimidation"" were used on January 6, and he noted that the question was whether Trump's own actions and statements ""incited"" the violence. ""Let's stick with the facts,"" Mehta said, adding that he wasn't ""interested"" in ""whataboutism."" He continued pressing Binnall on whether Trump's call for his supporters to march to the Capitol and his use of words like ""fight"" and ""show strength,"" followed by Trump's supporters storming the Capitol, satisfied the standards required to establish conspiracy. ""No,"" Binnall said. ""So the president, in your view, is both immune to inciting the riot and failing to stop it?"" Mehta asked. Binnall replied that ""the president cannot be subject"" to any judicial action because he ""failed to do something."" Joseph Sellers, a lawyer for House Democrats, countered that claim and said the ""fervor"" and ""energy"" of Trump's supporters directly preceding the Capitol riot indicated that he knew what they were planning to do. But Mehta pushed back, telling Sellers the plaintiffs' allegation of a conspiracy in this case is ""unusual"" and potentially ""problematic"" because the lawsuit does not allege that there was a direct meeting between the defendants including Trump, his then lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and the far-right groups Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. Alleging a conspiracy in the absence of such a link is ""dangerous"" because the defendants couldn't necessarily have controlled the reaction of Trump's supporters. Sellers conceded the point, but emphasized that Trump ""ratified"" his supporters' actions after the Capitol riot. Trump's initial silence during the Capitol breach has also come under scrutiny from the special House committee investigating the January 6 attack. The panel's top Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney, said last month that the committee was exploring the question of whether Trump, ""through action or inaction,"" sought to impede Congress' certification of now-President Joe Biden's electoral victory. The committee has released texts showing that Trump's allies — including his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and Fox News hosts — pleaded with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to have Trump order the violent mob to stand down. In the lawsuits against Trump, House Democrats pointed to his initial silence during the January 6 attack as evidence of an alleged agreement with the mob to block the certification of Biden's victory.

1/11/2022,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts announced a $500 million plan Monday to divert water out of Colorado under a 99-year-old compact between the states that allows Nebraska to seize access to Colorado land along the South Platte River and build canals. Ricketts said Nebraska would invoke its rights under the South Platte River Compact amid concerns that Colorado's plans for the river could reduce water flows into his state by as much as 90%, taking a potentially huge toll on Nebraska's agricultural and power industries and likely affecting water supplies in the state's two largest cities, Omaha and Lincoln. “We are very concerned about what is going to happen with these projects,” Ricketts, a Republican, said at a news conference. The reduced streamflows “are going to have a dramatic impact on our ability to feed the world."" The compact, approved in 1923, is a water-sharing agreement between the states that entitles Nebraska to 120 cubic feet per second (897.6 gallons) from the river during the irrigation season between April 1 and Oct. 15, and 500 cubic feet per second (3,740 gallons) during the non-irrigation season. Under the compact, Nebraska can build, maintain and operate canals within Colorado's borders that divert water from the South Platte River for use by Nebraska. It also gives Nebraska the power to buy land from Colorado landowners or gain access by invoking eminent domain. Nebraska's move is likely to trigger lawsuits between the states. Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, a Republican, said Colorado has been issuing water usage permits that would cut into Nebraska's rightful share. “It’s critical that we be able to maintain these flows,” Peterson said. Colorado released a report this month that identified 282 new projects within the South Platte River Basin on their side of the border, at a total cost of $9.87 billion. According to the report, the Colorado population living within the river basin is expected to grow 42% to 70% between 2015 and 2050, creating more demand for water. The report also warned that climate change may reduce streamflows and shift snowmelt patterns to earlier in the year, while creating greater agricultural demand for water. A spokesman for Colorado's Department of Natural Resources said he needed to consult with his state's engineer before issuing a response. An email to the office of Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, wasn't immediately returned. The South Platte River flows northeast from Colorado's fast-growing Front Range and into Nebraska, where it merges with the North Platte River to form the Platte River before crossing the rest of the state. Ricketts declined to disclose where Nebraska would get the money to pay for the project, saying he’ll release more details in his annual State of the State address to lawmakers on Thursday. He said Nebraska started work on a canal before World War I, but abandoned the project, part of which is still visible from Interstate 80 near Julesburg, Colorado. Peterson said the canal would feed into a reservoir that would store water for Nebraska's use. He said Nebraska officials grew increasingly concerned about Colorado's ability to deliver water as it deals with its own shortages. Nebraska and Colorado have been at odds several times in recent years, most notably with Colorado's early legalization of recreational marijuana. The move was criticized by governors and law enforcement officials in Nebraska, a conservative state that has steadfastly refused to allow the drug in any form. Last year, Ricketts railed  against Colorado Gov. Jared Polis' decision to sign a nonbinding proclimation that encouraged people to avoid meat one day a week, calling it “a direct attack on our way of life"" and signing a pro-meat declaration of his own. Meanwhile, Nebraska also announced plans to spend an estimated $200 million on water projects around the state. The plans include building a marina at Lake McConaughy State Recreational Area in western Nebraska, a visitor's lodge and other upgrades at Niobrara State Park and a 4,000-acre proposed lake to be located between Omaha and Lincoln. Speaker of the Legislature Mike Hilgers said the measure would help boost Nebraska's economy, tourism and recreational offerings. The combined projects would generate an estimated $5.6 billion in economic activity during construction, according to legislative estimates. “We know our water resources are incredibly critical to this state,"" said Hilgers, of Lincoln. ___ Follow Grant Schulte on Twitter: https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte",U.S./Associated Press,Nebraska announces $500M plan to claim water from Colorado,https://news.yahoo.com/nebraska-announces-500m-plan-claim-222118196.html
1/11/2022,"When Hollywood police came to the door of Flanagan High teacher Philip Velez Saturday night, they say he told them he was inside with his girlfriend. And, police say, to his mind, the 28-year-old Velez wasn’t lying — he thought of the 17-year-old Flanagan student in the apartment with him as his girlfriend. That didn’t prevent Velez from being arrested and charged with three counts of sexual battery by an adult on a victim between ages 12 and 18 and one count of being an authority figure engaging in sexual conduct with a student. Velez’s bond was set at $85,000 after a bond hearing, shown on WPLG-Channel 10, at which Velez’s attorney argued if this were 60 days in the future, there would be no alleged crime because the alleged victim would be 18. The state argued that Velez is a teacher who should “be protecting children, not engaging in sexual relationships with them.” Broward County Public Schools says Velez was hired July 25, 2019 as a teacher at the Pembroke Pines high school and “is currently active.” His LinkedIn page says he’s a culinary instructor and is an assistant basketball coaching intern. Miami-Dade high school teacher charged with lewd and lascivious molestation of two girls ‘You f---ing monster!’ In court, former student confronts Miami ex-teacher who raped her An arrest affidavit says the girl told police she and Velez began texting each other after a November fundraising event. After meeting a few times outside school, he invited her to his apartment in December and they began a sexual relationship. The arrest form says Velez told police “he considered [the girl] his girlfriend and that he has been in a romantic relationship with her since December 2021” and “he began to have feelings for [her] and they eventually began to have a sexual relationship.” Still, “Velez said they had spoken about the fact that it was wrong to be together” because of the girl’s age. The girl, according to the arrest form, was acting “suspiciously” enough that her older sister mentioned something to their father Saturday. The older sister also told her father the girl’s cellphone locator put her at a Van Buren Street single-floor apartment building. The girls’ father called Hollywood police, who went to Velez’s apartment around 9:15 p.m. “She said they were having vaginal intercourse, without a condom, when the police knocked at the door,” the arrest affidavit says.",U.S./Miami Herald,A Broward high school teacher is charged with the sexual battery of a student,https://news.yahoo.com/broward-high-school-teacher-charged-205718170.html
1/11/2022,"In a just universe, someone would find Jesse Watters in his saddest moment, a time of crisis and sorrow, and mock him on camera before broadcasting the footage millions of giggling viewers — an indignity the longtime Fox News host once foisted upon homeless people living in New York’s Penn Station. In this universe, however, Watters is getting promoted. More from Rolling Stone 'Sean Thinks We Should Do This': Insiders Reveal How Trump Relied on Hannity, Ingraham, and Other Fox News Luminaries Rand Paul Comes Out as Pro-Omicron Fauci: Fire Fox News Host Who Called for 'Ambush' The network announced on Monday that it is giving Watters his own 7 p.m. show to lead into Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Laura Ingraham, respectively. The show will be called Jesse Watters Primetime, and if the host’s career thus far is any indication it will be a reliable cesspool of bigotry, misinformation, and, more than anything, the smug, self-satisfied air of someone who has been able to parlay a total and utter lack of shame into millions. The 7 p.m. slot had previously been occupied by Martha MacCallum, one of the few actual news anchors employed by the network. MacCallum’s relative adherence to reality didn’t go over very well with viewers following the 2020 election, though, and so she was moved to the afternoon. The network had been experimenting with the time slot ever since. The decision to hand it Watters permanently means the network is heaping on yet another scoop of propaganda into its primetime lineup to pair with what Carlson, Hannity, and Ingraham spew every night. Here’s a taste of some of the controversy Watters has courted over the course of his time at the network. Watters’ latest controversy came just a few weeks ago, when at at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest he urged people to “ambush” Dr. Anthony Fauci. Watters said people should be “respectful” when questioning the nation’s top infectious disease expert … and then described the potential confrontation via a cascade of violent cliches. “Now you go in for the kill shot,” he said. “The kill shot? With an ambush? Deadly. Because he doesn’t see it coming. This is when you say, ‘Dr. Fauci, you funded risky research at a sloppy Chinese lab, the same lab that sprung this pandemic on the world. You know why people don’t trust you, don’t you?’ Boom! He is dead. He is dead. He’s done. Now you do that — 30 seconds, it’s all you need. Now you get that footage to us, you get it to Fox.” The comments weren’t as shocking as they should have been. Watters has been dutifully bashing Dr. Fauci for most of the pandemic. He even suggested in October that Disney’s documentary on the National Institute of Health chief was produced as a way for Disney to pay Fauci back for spreading enough fear about Covid-19 to lock the nation down, which caused people to stay at home and watch Disney, which caused the company’s stock to climb. “They got all those Beijing profits coming in because Tony ran interference for the lab leak,” he added, again referencing the theory that the disease was manufactured by Chinese scientists. Fauci responded to Watters imploring people to ambush him by calling the comments “horrible” and arguing that Watters should be “fired on the spot.” He rightly predicted that the network wouldn’t take any action. “He’s gonna go, very likely, unaccountable,” Fauci said. “I mean, whatever network he’s on is not going to do anything for him.” Watters got his start as a henchman for longtime Fox News stalwart Bill O’Reilly, taking a camera crew into the streets of New York and elsewhere for a series of racist segments teeing off on the city’s demographically diverse population. The most notorious installment of “Watters’ World,” as the bit was called, may have taken place ahead of the 2016 election in Lower Manhattan’s Chinatown. It took Watters a scant five minutes to fill up a Bingo card’s worth of Asian-American stereotypes. He mockingly bowed to people, asked if residents knew karate, and more — all over clips of Bruce Lee and The Karate Kid. You can watch the original video here, but we suggest watching The Daily Show‘s Ronny Chieng break it down in full: “That last guy hated you,” O’Reilly told Watters back in the studio. “He did,” Watters replied as they both laughed. “One of many.” Watters then joked about how the residents he interviewed just stood there and absorbed his abuse, because they “are a polite people.” O’Reilly sent Watters to Penn Station in 2015 to examine homelessness under new mayor Bill de Blasio, whom O’Reilly described as “uber liberal.” Watters interviewed passersby about how uncomfortable the homeless made them feel, and even put the microphone in front of actual homeless people. He asked how they made money, whether they slept in the station, and what kind of drugs they liked. Back in the studio, Watters and O’Reilly discussed the danger of homeless over footage of the desperate people he interviewed. Watters led the roundtable show The Five for most of former President Trump’s time in office. In April 2017, he made a very strange, very suggestive comment about Ivanka Trump while the panel was discussing remarks she made while overseas. “I really like the way she was holding that microphone,” he said while trying to stifle a giggle after calling Democrats are hypocrites for talking about respecting women while at the same time disagreeing with Trump’s daughter. WATCH: Jesse Watters on Fox News re Ivanka Trump: ""I really like how she was speaking into that microphone"" pic.twitter.com/HoJHLpMtq1 — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) April 26, 2017 Watters received blowback for the apparent blowjob joke. He claimed it wasn’t sexual, though, insisting he was talking about how Ivanka sounded like a “smooth jazz radio DJ.” Soon thereafter, he did what many Fox News hosts have done after they find themselves in the middle of a controversy: He announced he was going on vacation. Watters went to Philadelphia ahead of the 2016 election to ask a bunch of people about racism. It quickly became clear that he was trying to demonstrate it was overblown and not really that big of a deal. He asked one man if “racism” was thrown around too much in America. “Yes,” the man said. “What’s that about?” responded Watters. He then asked the same question of a woman of color, who said it wasn’t talked about enough. Watters challenged her: “We don’t talk about racism enough? It’s all we talk about in this country.” It went on like this, with Watters taking people who downplayed racism in stride, while trying to poke holes in the arguments of anyone who took it seriously. He made fun of a woman for thinking that Trump explicitly asking Black people to vote for him was racist. He wondered how someone could argue Trump wanting to construct a border wall was racist. He teased someone who admitted he was undocumented. “Welcome to America,” Watters said. “You can stay … for now.” One through line through Watters’ career is the shit-eating grin that’s perpetually plastered across his face. It’s very clearly all a joke to him. He even titled his 2021 book How I Saved the World. Watters’ new weeknight counterparts may take the implications of information war a little more seriously, but Watters seems to view his place at the feet of the former president strictly as a ticket to money and fame, as CNN’s Brian Stelter pointed out after the promotion announcement. More than anything, Watters seems amused that it’s all as easy as loving Trump, taking it to the libs, and pushing a few cultural hot buttons here and there. Sadly, it is that easy, and Watters has something new to smile about on Monday.

1/11/2022,"The UFC commentator and podcaster Joe Rogan said he would eat only meat and fruit for a month. He's said the ""carnivore"" diet helped him lose weight and have more energy. It also caused diarrhea. Dietitians don't recommend the diet because it lacks nutrients like fiber. The podcaster Joe Rogan said he was giving up vegetables, bread, and just about every other food group to kick off the new year. Rogan said on Instagram last week that he was embarking on a so-called carnivore diet in January (after a final indulgence of pasta for dinner). ""Just meat and fruit for the whole month,"" he wrote. It's not clear what his regular meals consist of, though his Instagram suggests ribeye for breakfast is one staple. Rogan has tried the diet before — he said he lost weight but had severe digestive issues, too. Dietitians don't recommend it because a lack of nutrients can cause side effects like digestive upset. In January 2020, the podcaster said he'd spent 30 days eating nothing but animal products, during which he lost 12 pounds and experienced more energy and relief from some health issues. He said on Instagram that ""lots of aches and pains went away"" and that he'd seen ""improvements in my vitiligo,"" a chronic skin condition. There was, however, a major side effect: Rogan said he had frequent and explosive poops, which he described in graphic detail to his followers. ""I haven't shit my pants yet, but I've come to accept that if I keep going with this diet it's just a matter of time before we lose a battle,"" he posted on January 11, 2020, with a picture of his dinner of liver and bacon. The gastrointestinal issues lasted about two weeks, Rogan wrote later. At the time, Rogan's Instagram suggested a typical day of eating on the carnivore diet involved two meals. Breakfast included six eggs or a steak, and for dinner he would eat another steak, either beef or elk, and occasionally other types of wild game such as bison. Diarrhea may be a common side effect of cutting veggies, grains, and other plant foods out of your diet. While meat contains important nutrients, it's devoid of fiber, a type of carbohydrate that is slow to digest. Research suggests fiber can reduce the risk of illnesses like heart disease and aid in healthy digestion. Many plant foods are also rich in other nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants — and missing them in your diet may cause health issues. That January is known to some, like Rogan, as World Carnivore Month and to others as Veganuary highlights a persistent conflict between meat eaters and vegans about which diet is best. The diet has been popularized by advocates like Dr. Shawn Baker, an orthopedic surgeon and the CEO of Revero. ""We're trying to simplify. Rather than adding supplements, superfoods, this is the opposite approach, removing irritants,"" Baker previously told Insider. ""It's very simple to follow. No other animal on the planet sits there with a diet manual or a calculator."" The carnivore diet is also compatible with popular keto and paleo diets. Other carnivore dieters have shared anecdotal stories of weight loss and mental clarity, using hashtags like #MeatHeals, on Twitter and Instagram. But while Baker is working on research to study the health effects of a carnivore diet, there's no evidence to back up any claims about its benefits. Dietitians caution against carnivore diets because of potential side effects. Carbs are an important energy source, and eliminating them almost entirely can lead to muscle breakdown and fatigue, experts say. Eating red meat has also been linked to a higher risk of heart disease and cancer — though the risks of eating unprocessed red meats might be lower than the risks of regularly eating processed meats. In contrast, diets rich in plants have been linked to a lower risk of illness. Read the original article on Insider",Health/INSIDER,Joe Rogan said he is eating only meat and fruit for the next month.

1/11/2022,"Franklin County Coroner officials have identified a Chiawana High student who likely died of exposure at a downtown Pasco construction site. Manuel Rodriguez, 16, is believed to have died Friday but wasn’t found until Saturday, said Franklin County Coroner Curtis McGary. Officials believe alcohol may have been a factor in his death. An autopsy is set for Wednesday. Pasco police said Rodriguez was found Saturday when a passerby saw what they believed was a body at the construction site of the new Lewis Street overpass, at Lewis Street and Main Street. Pasco Police Department spokesman Sgt. Rigo Pruneda said the teen’s parents notified police Friday that he was missing and they were worried. He was a student at Chiawana High School. “It’s kind of an out of the way place ... where they’re building the new big overpass,” Pruneda said. “It appears he had been there for a while, and he wasn’t dressed for the weather.” The $36 million Lewis Street overpass will carry the roadway above the BNSF Railway tracks between Second and Oregon Avenues. Construction began in Aug. 2021 and is expected to be completed in Fall 2023, according to the city of Pasco. Pruneda said detectives are investigating the circumstances of Rodriguez’s death to determine if alcohol was a factor, but foul play is not suspected. “It’s a tragic thing when you lose a child that age,” Pruneda said. McGary said alcohol can contribute to exposure deaths. “What would happen is the individual would pass out if it’s alcohol related, and staying in the cold they would suffer from hypothermia,” he said. McGary said it’s important to always dress warm in cold temperatures and people should avoid alcohol if they plan on being outside in the cold for prolonged periods of time.",U.S./Tri-City Herald,‘Tragic thing when you lose a child that age.’ Tri-Cities teen who died of exposure identified,https://news.yahoo.com/tragic-thing-lose-child-age-204345505.html
1/11/2022,"A “high powered” businessman threw chocolate bars at sleeping passengers and tried to headbutt British Airways flight attendants during a “bizarre” drunken rampage, a court has heard. William Clegg, who was travelling in business class, also told cabin crew he wanted to “go outside and see his friend” while the plane was still 38,000ft up in the air, jurors were told. Mr Clegg, from Notting Hill, west London, is accused of assaulting five attendants during the flight from San Jose, California to London Heathrow on Aug 25 2019. The 33-year-old, who regularly travels for work, was said to have taken two Ambien sleeping pills and one Imovane sleeping tablet along with three glasses of wine and two travel-sized bottles of Baileys. Cabin crew were forced to restrain him after he tried to pull his T-shirt over a female flight attendant’s head before dragging another member of staff to the floor. Clegg, who wore a navy suit and a blue shirt at Isleworth Crown Court, denies five counts of assault by beating. Paul Edwards, prosecuting, said that Clegg suffered from epilepsy and insomnia, and had a ""high-powered job involving travelling to different countries and staying just a short while"". Mr Edwards said: ""On the flight, Mr Clegg took two tablets of zolpidem and one tablet of zopiclone. He also drank three glasses of wine and two bottles of Baileys. ""This led, the Crown will say, to him acting bizarrely. ""He was walking up and down the corridor in business class. ""He went to the galley, the kitchen area, and started throwing chocolate bars at passengers who were sleeping at the time. He said he wanted to go outside to see his friend. He was told by a flight attendant that we were 38,000 feet in the air.” When he was confronted by flight attendant Amy Stewart, Clegg responded by lifting up his T-shirt and trying to put it over her head. ""He also used a vape in the flight,"" Mr Edwards said. The cabin crew decided to take Clegg to the back of the plane to try and restrain him. But Clegg grabbed the arm of attendant Jamie Marsh and threw him to the floor. Clegg was then taken to the back of the plane. ""It was after he was at the back of the plane that he tried to headbutt Amy Stewart three times,"" the prosecutor said. As he was being restrained at the rear of the aircraft, Clegg allegedly shouted: ""This is a joke, you don't know who I am, who do you think you are doing this to me?"" Attendants Cieran Robert Smith and Franz Hartmann were also assaulted while restraining Clegg, Mr Edwards said. He said that Clegg hit Mr Robert Smith in the temple and kicked Mr Hartmann. Carlie Titchner, a fifth attendant involved in restraining Clegg, did not remember being assaulted by him but found afterwards that she had bruises on her arm. Mr Edwards said: ""The main issue for the Crown is, was the defendant reckless when he took the tablets?""
