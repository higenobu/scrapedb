2/11/2022,"The Lord of the Rings and Get Back director, Peter Jackson, has topped the Forbes magazine rich list as the highest paid entertainer of 2021. Jackson made US$580m (A$809m, £428m) last year, primarily through the sale of part of his visual effects business Weta Digital to Unity Software, for $1.6bn. Forbes estimates Jackson personally made about $600m in cash and $375m in stock from the deal, making him the third person in history to become a billionaire from making films, after Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.  The top 10 entertainers on the list are all male, with only three women making the top 20. The musicians Bob Dylan, Paul Simon and Bruce Springsteen all made the top 10 from selling their back catalogues, with the latter coming in at No 2 after selling his music to Sony Music for an estimated $500m. South Park’s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, came in at No 6 with $210m, having signed a six-year $900m deal with Paramount+ to make several films. The musicians Kanye West, Jay-Z and the actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson also made the top 10 – from films and music sales but also from lucrative commercial deals selling sneakers, champagne and tequila, respectively. Reese Witherspoon was the top-earning woman last year at No 12, having made $115m through her production company Hello Sunshine, which focuses on female-led stories, and a reported $20m payday for her role in Apple TV’s drama The Morning Show.

2/11/2022,"The telco Optus has appointed the former New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian, who is under investigation by the state’s corruption watchdog, to a senior executive role. In a statement, the Singapore-owned company said Berejiklian had been appointed to the newly created role of managing director, enterprise, business and institutional.  Berejiklian resigned as premier in October after the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption announced it was investigating whether she broke the law by failing to report matters that she “suspected on reasonable grounds concerned or may concern corrupt conduct” by her ex-lover, the former Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire. She has consistently denied acting improperly during her relationship with Maguire, saying when she resigned: “I state categorically that I have always acted with the highest level of integrity.” Berejiklian said on Friday she was “excited and proud to join an organisation that impacts the lives of millions of Australians every day and prides itself in providing outstanding customer service”. “I look forward to working with Kelly [Bayer Rosmarin, the Optus chief executive] and the executive team of Optus who are providing inspiring and innovative leadership in the telco sector.” In a statement, Optus said the former premier’s job at the company was to “lift its focus on unlocking a greater share of the multi-billion-dollar enterprise, business, and institutional markets”.

2/11/2022,"In 1995 Ai Weiwei held up an ancient Chinese ceramic vessel, opened his arms to let it go, and stood there as it shattered. His new exhibition about craft and fakery includes a recent remake of Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn in Lego. It’s impressive how the black, white and grey Lego bricks create shadowy Warholian images of the artist in three stages of smashing a masterpiece. I feel obliged to explain. But I can’t, really. I don’t actually know what is clever about smashing an archaeological treasure – the Han dynasty ruled China when the Roman Empire ruled Europe – so I will quote the exhibition guide instead: the “transformative act” of destroying a 2,000-year-old work of art (transforming it into little tiny pieces, I guess) “drew attention to the Chinese government’s widespread destruction of the country’s heritage”.  And there you have this exhibition in a nutshell: a display of sometimes amusing but superficial art that we are urged to appreciate as “important” because of the artist’s unquestionably heroic political acts. Ai Weiwei is a true hero of free speech, braver than most of us will ever be, and – in his tireless campaigning for refugees – compassionate, too. I admire him deeply. But this exhibition made me seriously doubt whether he is a good artist. The problem with his new version of Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn is that he wants to have his cake and smash it. The alleged campaigning, critical point is the direct opposite of what it actually makes us feel. Seeing him smash an urn, we laugh. We don’t ponder the erosion of China’s heritage. Instead we enjoy seeing it happen before our eyes. And remaking the original photographs in Lego just accentuates that celebration of irony, freedom, the throwaway modern world. I think even that is an overreading. The gesture is – literally – throwaway. For in this show it sometimes seems Ai Weiwei is better at throwing concepts in the air than clarifying what he means by them, as they crash to earth. The Lego shares a gallery with old-fashioned wood-framed display cases containing a collection of ancient art from China that Ai Weiwei bought in 2020. It’s a mix of styles and periods, including a buckled-up image of a crouching hare in red sandstone and a sensual broken limestone Buddha. The artist claims at least five of these apparently time-hallowed sculptures are modern fakes. For the forgery business is so refined in contemporary China it is transforming the historical record. The gallery points out the “fakes”. For what it’s worth I think they do look dodgy. Their surfaces are cleaner and sharper. The signs of age appear artificial. But perhaps Ai Weiwei is playing with my mind, presenting the real as fake, the fake as real. If only I cared. The myth of authenticity, the fascination of the fake – this is the small change of postmodernism that has been around for decades now. As with smashing a Han urn, mixing real and fake ancient Chinese art just gets in the way of any chance, as a westerner, I might have of responding aesthetically to this art. We live in an entire world of inauthentic replicas. It is not at all daring or memorable to point that out, again. At least when Damien Hirst celebrates the inauthentic he does it on a colossal scale in his bad taste epic museum of fake treasures, The Wreck of the Unbelievable. But I suspect snooty, cosy Kettle’s Yard wouldn’t touch Damien with a surgical glove on the end of a bargepole. This exhibition is boring because its urge to provoke is constantly checked by an insistence on Ai Weiwei’s moral excellence. I cannot believe Ai Weiwei has put his name to a set of blue and white porcelain plates with childish paintings of refugees on them. A helicopter buzzing a crowd! A boat crammed with people – painted on a porcelain plate! It’s the kind of cheap, easy “gesture” I’d expect of Grayson Perry. Though that may be unfair – at least Perry aspires to satire. These well-meaning platters are merely mawkish and sentimental. I feel offended to have my distress at the treatment of refugees pandered to in this way. One sad possibility is that Ai Weiwei has the same problem now as dissident writers who fled communist Europe in the 1970s or 80s. The real meaning and power of his art lay in the sheer courage of his opposition to China’s dictatorial state. In exile, he is adrift. Some of the art here muddies his previously clear stance for freedom by implying democracy is just as unfree as a totalitarian state. Surveillance Camera and Plinth is a marble replica of a security camera – it might be anywhere, from Beijing to Cambridge city centre. But the meaning of these objects surely depends on how they are used, why and where. Anyway, the marble is overstated and artistically heavy. There are other everyday objects imitated in stone – a marble toilet roll, a jade sex toy and smartphone. Funny for a moment, but so what? Their meanings remain in the shallow end. Marcel Duchamp, more that a century ago, “chose” objects from the world as readymade art. His levity mocks Ai Weiwei’s stone gravity. Turning readymades into marble and jade is a ponderous way to make your point. In another brilliant act of antiquity abuse, he’s painted the Coca-Cola logo on a Han vase. It symbolises this exhibition, which itself resembles the cool Cambridge outlet of a global brand. But the guy is phoning it in, on a jade iPhone.

2/11/2022,"HM Revenue & Customs has been accused by an influential group of MPs of “ignorance and inaction” on recouping £6bn of fraudulent Covid-19 support payments, drawing an angry backlash from the tax authority. The public accounts committee (PAC), which monitors state spending, issued a litany of criticisms of HMRC, warning that money surrendered to fraudsters would ultimately add to the cost of living crisis engulfing Britain.  In a series of criticisms described as “damning” by shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, the PAC said: HMRC has effectively “written off” £4bn of Covid-related fraud. Plans to recover fraudulent payments are “unambitious”. This risks “rewarding the unscrupulous”. Customer service at the tax authority has “collapsed”. HMRC is not doing enough to crack down on tax avoidance. PAC chair Dame Meg Hillier highlighted the volume of fraudulent claims made via three HMRC-administered Covid grant schemes, which include furlough, the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme and Rishi Sunak’s Eat Out To Help Out package for hospitality. Citing HMRC’s estimate that it may recover £2bn of £6bn in fraudulent claims, she said: “The level of fraud and error in furlough that employers will get away with is a real concern. “What signal does it send when HMRC rolls over on billions of pounds of fraud and error directly related to Covid support packages?” HMRC said its estimate of what will be recovered did not mean that it has written off the remainder, which it intends to pursue. But the report said HMRC was not doing enough to reclaim the money and was also failing in its wider duties, including ensuring tax compliance and preventing people being lured into avoidance schemes. “With the current parlous state of the public finances we can ill afford to be so cavalier over so much taxpayers’ money,” said Hillier. “Every taxpayers’ pound lost to a fraudster will lead to honest ordinary people feeling the post-pandemic pinch harder and harder.” Criticism of HMRC comes weeks after Treasury minister Lord Agnew resigned over a separate decision by the government to write off £4.3bn of fraudulent business loans. Reeves said: “This is damning. It should be a source of enduring shame to the chancellor that he has so casually written off billions in taxpayers’ money that is now in the hand of criminals and gangs.” HMRC staff are understood to feel that the tax authority is being unfairly singled out and that it is making progress on beefing up its tax collection capacity after a pandemic-affected year when it collected £609bn, down 4.3% on the previous year. A government spokesperson said: “While we acknowledge lessons that need to be learned in this report, we reject many of the statements made by the PAC. “No fraudulent payments have been written off and we’re taking action on multiple fronts to recover overpayments, and our Taxpayer Protection Taskforce is expected to recover up to £1bn from fraudulent or incorrect payments.” The taskforce is made up of nearly 1,300 staff and is expected to recover an additional £1bn of taxpayers’ money. The spokesperson added: “The vast majority of payments in the schemes were made correctly to employers, and most error and fraud was legitimate claimants making mistakes or inflating their claims, often small amounts per case. From March 2020 to May 2021, the three main Covid loan schemes – bounce back, CBILS and a scheme for larger loans, CLBILS – handed out nearly £80bn to businesses. Yet serious fraud concerns have emerged since then, most notably in relation to the bounce back loan scheme. The government extends CBILS to cover large businesses in the CLBILS.  Sunak announces the bounce back loan scheme (BBLS) for loans of £50,000 for those who certified that they qualified. British Business Bank chief executive Keith Morgan writes to business secretary Alok Sharma that the scheme’s rapid launch posed “very significant fraud and credit risks”. The business department launches the bounce back loan scheme, with 80,000 applications by the first afternoon. The National Audit Office warns taxpayers stand to lose £26bn on BBLS and that up to 60% of customers may fail to repay loans. HSBC closes the scheme to new customers. The Treasury extends BBLS, CBILS and CLBILS to end of January 2021. (It will be extended again.) Sunak announces £100m for a taxpayer protection taskforce of more than 1,200 HMRC staff to combat Covid19-related fraud - but the loan scheme is not covered. All three loan schemes closed to new applicants. All loans were processed by 31 May. A National Audit Office report describes government funding for counter-fraud on the bounce back loans “inadequate” and highlights £4.9bn estimated BBLS fraud losses. Treasury and business minister Lord Agnew resigns at the House of Lords dispatch box, citing frustrations with the lack of action on Covid-19-related fraud. “Our Covid support schemes were implemented at unprecedented speed to protect millions of jobs and businesses at a time when families needed it the most. “As a result, our economy is back to pre-pandemic levels and growing at the fastest rate in the G7. The cost of inaction would have been far greater than the cost of fraud and error in the support schemes.” HMRC added that the report’s claims of a collapse in customer service, such as call waiting times on the phone, were a “gross distortion”. At a PAC select committee hearing last week, HMRC deputy chief executive Angela McDonald said she expected the authority to clear its backlog of outstanding cases by April.",News/World news,HMRC accused of ‘ignorance and inaction’ over £6bn Covid fraud,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/hmrc-accused-of-ignorance-and-inaction-over-6bn-covid
2/11/2022,"There could be no quibbling with Ralf Rangnick’s decision to drop Cristiano Ronaldo for Tuesday’s game at Burnley. The 37-year-old provided evidence in the manager’s defence by adding to Manchester United’s catalogue of bungled opportunities after being introduced from the bench. Earlier in the season Ronaldo’s sharpness regularly saved United. Now he has gone five matches without a goal and Rangnick cannot ignore the fact that, when Ronaldo is not scoring, he does not offer much else, unlike Edinson Cavani. With a resurgent Southampton visiting Old Trafford this weekend and United still chronically fragile at the back, Rangnick will need to field forwards who can be relied upon to convert most of their chances if they are to avoid falling further behind in the race for the top four. Does he have any? PD  Manchester United v Southampton, Saturday 12.30pm (all-times GMT) Last time Norwich fought a Premier League relegation battle, they beat Manchester City 3-2 in one of the standout games of the 2019-20 season. An entertaining but naive side ultimately went down with a whimper; the same seemed nailed on this time around but, under Dean Smith, the Canaries have discovered a steelier edge and have given themselves a shot at survival. They have played more games than those around them, though, and may find their fixture list dwindling all too quickly once a trip to Anfield has followed hot on the heels of the leaders’ visit. A big scalp could do wonders for their prospects: Manchester City have not lost in the league since October and are seemingly cruising to the title but if Norwich can repeat the trick of two years ago then a different end-of-season outcome could look more than realistic. NA Norwich v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm Allan Saint-Maximin and Philippe Coutinho might well be the two best players outside the top three teams in the Premier League. The prospect of watching both in action helps to make Aston Villa’s trip to Newcastle this weekend’s most appealing match. It also promises to be a testing first Villa start for Callum Chambers, who, given Ezri Konsa’s suspension, is likely to be cast into a Villa defence that wobbled badly during the midweek draw with Leeds. With Bruno Guimarães also in line to make a first start for Newcastle, who are seeking a third consecutive win, there is quite a show in store at St James’ Park. PD Newcastle v Aston Villa, Sunday 2pm One of Burnley’s problems when it comes to scoring is the creation of chances. They have few players capable of producing the assists required for strikers to score goals. A key creative asset is Dwight McNeil but he has provided a sole assist this season in 20 Premier League outings. To make matters worse for McNeil he has not found the back of the net either, which goes some way to explaining why Burnley have won only a single game and scored 17 goals in 20 matches. Against Manchester United, McNeil looked tired and struggled to get involved in the game despite playing the full 90 minutes. The new signing Wout Weghorst is supposed to be the man who can fire Burnley off the bottom and to safety, but he needs service from crosses and no one is providing it at the moment. Without them, and with formidable opponents due on Sunday in Liverpool, Burnley could be doomed. WU Burnley v Liverpool, Sunday 2pm Everton went into the last day of the 1950-51 season outside the relegation zone and knowing their survival would be guaranteed if they drew with the bottom club, Sheffield Wednesday. They lost 6-0. There was a whiff of that sort of haplessness in Tuesday’s defeat at Newcastle. Leeds are probably one of the last opponents Frank Lampard would have chosen to face as he tries to reverse Everton’s downward momentum. Marcelo Bielsa’s team, who have scored six in their past two away games, are likely to swarm all over a side who looked devoid of confidence and energy in midweek. Donny van de Beek might add quality to the home midfield if given his debut but that – and Anthony Gordon’s precocious class – are unlikely to be enough to suppress Leeds. In the event of an away win, Leeds fans are sure to remind Lampard that he risks becoming the first Everton manager in 71 years to preside over a relegation. PD Everton v Leeds, Saturday 3pm Brentford have lost seven games of their past eight, in the top flight have played more times than anyone else in the bottom half and are only six points clear of 18th. If it looks like a relegation battle and sounds like one, then it probably is one: the cushion given to the Bees by their early-season form could only last so long and it is now vital they string some points together. Beating Crystal Palace would have the added bonus of dragging Patrick Vieira’s men to the fringes of the scrap. Thomas Frank needs to rediscover a winning formula and it cannot be long before he finds a place in the starting lineup for Josh Dasilva. The dynamic midfielder missed almost a year with a hip injury and his comeback as a substitute over the past week has been a positive. Dasilva is good for a goal and, at his best, a dominant presence; if he can find form quickly, perhaps alongside Christian Eriksen when the Dane is ready in a few weeks, Brentford may have the added spark needed to keep them away from trouble. NA Brentford v Crystal Palace, Saturday 3pm When these sides met earlier in the season, Michael Antonio scored twice and celebrated by holding up a cardboard cutout of himself. West Ham could probably have done with a real-life imitator of Antonio in recent matches, since the striker has been out of form. But that is partly because of the way that opponents have tended to start playing against West Ham, sitting deep and leaving Antonio no room to run into. Brendan Rodgers’ side are unlikely to play like that at the King Power, not least because they do not have a reliable defence. So Antonio and West Ham’s nifty attacking midfielders could have yet more fun at the expense of Leicester, against whom West Ham have scored 10 times in their last three encounters. PD Leicester v West Ham, Sunday 4.30pm Ismaïla Sarr has not played for Watford since 20 November, and the fact they have not won since is no coincidence. Sarr is one of the league’s best wingers and should not be toiling around its lower reaches. He is back in contention at last when they host Brighton and should have a spring in his step: Sarr made his comeback from a knee injury during the knockout stages of the Africa Cup of Nations, where he played an important role in helping Senegal to their first-ever continental title. There was certainly no suggestion of any rust during the final, when he regularly roasted the Egypt left-back Ahmed Fattouh, and Roy Hodgson must integrate him effectively if the Hornets are to stand any chance of staying up. They have looked solid enough in a 4-4-2 since the veteran manager’s arrival but goal threat has been limited: if Hodgson can find a way to get Sarr firing within his system, his final mission in management might just be accomplished. NA Watford v Brighton, Saturday 3pm Pierre-Emile Højbjerg created a goal against former club Southampton in midweek but Antonio Conte felt his overall performance merited being substituted on the hour. The Dane was poor in possession and frequently overwhelmed when Southampton attacked, as Højberg struggled to stem the flow in front of his defence. The midfielder has already made 36 appearances for club and country this season, which could explain a dip in form as fatigue kicks in after a long time without a noticeable break following the European Championships. Luckily for Conte, he can now call upon Rodrigo Bentancur in the centre of midfield. The man who arrived from Juventus in January came off the bench in the defeat on Wednesday and showed some nice touches to indicate he could make the difference in a midfield short of attacking flair and ideas. A start against Wolves could help Bentancur settle in the Premier League before the more daunting prospect of Manchester City next week. WU Tottenham v Wolves, Sunday 2pm Late in January the Premier League met other governing bodies and the police to discuss the rise in crowd trouble at games, and it has led to an urgent review being launched. Events in the FA Cup last weekend – that included a Leicester fan attacking Nottingham Forest players as they celebrated a goal and subsequently being charged with common assault – suggested the problem will not abate in a hurry and the discussions about its cause will rumble on. A rise in drug use inside stadiums comes up in dispatches, as does the suggestion that bottled-up lockdown energy is coming out in ill-advised ways; perhaps there is also the fostering of an “I’ll do what I want” attitude led by a government that seems happy to ignore rules while professing disgust when others do exactly that. Either way it needs sorting: no one can pretend football hooliganism in England ever faded to zero but grounds should be safe and welcoming places for everyone. This weekend would be a good time to begin the journey back towards those conditions.

He wants his country to know that hired guns exist. How secretive? “On paper, the firm does not exist, with no company registration, tax returns or organisational chart to be found,” writes Pjotr Sauer in Moscow. “Western governments and academics argue that Wagner is an unofficial foreign policy tool … deployed where Russia wants to extend its influence or create upheaval. Prigozhin and Moscow have denied any knowledge of Wagner; officially, private military companies remain illegal in Russia.” Notable quote: “This current situation does not suit many of my comrades,” Gabidullin says of the private army ban. “More importantly, it does not suit the dead mercenaries’ parents and relatives, who cannot even talk openly about how their son or brother died.
