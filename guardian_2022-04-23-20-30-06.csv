4/23/2022,"Born in Oldham in 1966, Shobna Gulati began her career as a dancer and choreographer, before landing breakthrough TV roles as the lovable idiot Anita in Dinnerladies and Sunita Alahan in Coronation Street. As well as a 35-year career in acting, she published Remember Me? in 2019, a memoir chronicling her experience of caring for her late mother, who had dementia. Having recently starred in Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, Shobna is currently touring alongside her 27-year-old son, Akshay, in the play The Rise and Fall of Little Voice. This photograph was taken at my sister’s house. I can tell because we’re sitting on one of her fancy chairs. I had just started in Dinnerladies, and we’d come down from Manchester to London for a wedding, which is why we’re in our special outfits. Akshay is holding a guitar given to him by my mum. He has always been very fond of music and learned the euphonium at school, but big brass instruments aren’t very sexy, so he gave it up. He gave up the guitar, too. Actually, he could be playing it again, but I wouldn’t know. He’s busy doing his own thing; he wouldn’t tell me! I’m working with Akshay at the moment, and what’s beautiful is that we’re in a space where we are equals. I’m not his mum and he’s not my son – we are actors in a room. There’s a hierarchy in place, and it’s the director who has the keys. It’s an extraordinary feeling to relinquish that normal mother-son dynamic. Especially testing as a single mum. My journey as a parent has been full of challenges. The papers always used to describe me as “falling pregnant”, which I found hilarious. I didn’t trip and land on someone’s willy. I became pregnant. It wasn’t society’s “normal” pregnancy narrative, so it was spoken about in loaded terms. I always thought I’d go to university and meet someone, get married and have babies, like my sisters and brothers. But it wasn’t that way for me. I was 28 and dancing at the time. Working on a show called Moti Roti, Puttli Chunni, a play at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East in London. It was my first proper theatre job and it was getting great reviews. When we were touring, I grew and grew with Akshay inside me, and confronted all the challenges that being pregnant brings. It was out of wedlock and with a man who my family and wider community didn’t consider part of our culture. I had to hide my bump when I came to Manchester, and all the aunties would say: “You’ve put on weight!” The next time I turned up, I was with a baby and one of them asked: “Whose baby is this?” I said: “It’s mine, aunty.” I was shamed and faced a huge backlash, but I’m not afraid of standing up for my choices and who I am. Regardless of how the rest of the community reacted to my baby, my mum supported me. I try very hard to emulate that approach with Akshay. Whatever you need, I’m here. Nothing he can do could shock me. Mum stood up to her own children and community; stood up for me and helped me raise Akshay when I was on my own. What I’ve learned – from that experience and with caring for mum before she died – was that in the end it is all about love. There is nothing beyond that. Sometimes Akshay and I have arguments. Discussions we call them. We do conflict resolution exercises, which have been very helpful when we reach peaks. We’ve got to be able to speak our minds. The shit can stink if you don’t flush it away and start again. We both really like to eat and to watch football. I’m a Manchester United fan, and there was a point when he was little and wanted to support a different team. When he told me that, I replied: “I will disown you.” All that understanding – throw it out of the window! But as he progresses into adulthood, I have to get rid of the reins. Understand he’s becoming an adult, too, with his own life. That’s been hard for me, but I’m getting there. I’ve got this photo up in my bedroom, and even though I don’t remember it being taken, it’s always been an important image. Me and Ma against the world. We’ve always had that mentality – along with my grandma, who had a pretty big role in bringing me up. In our household there were no men. It was either Mam or Nani and my cousins, who were three girls. Five very strong women. This saying gets bandied about that lads need a “strong male role model”, but I like to think I turned out OK having exclusively strong females bringing me up. I was known at school for having a famous mum, which meant more scrutiny on top of being black and Punjabi, in a very white school in Oldham. With an afro. It was never a case of, “Your mum is a successful actor on the telly.” It was more, “Oh, I saw your mum in a magazine, she was wearing this.” But the older I got, the more I appreciated what she had achieved. To consistently work as a woman of south Asian heritage in a very male- and white-dominated space is dead cool. Ma always encouraged me to speak my mind. But there was a lot I didn’t share with her because I didn’t want to burden her with any more than she already had going on. She was really good at advice, though. If someone was being mean at school, she’d say something like: “Fuck it!” She also instilled in me an attitude of, if you haven’t got anything nice to say to someone, don’t say anything. For example: don’t ever tell anyone they look tired. Especially a woman. They can’t do anything about it and it’s just mean. She’s full of fantastic titbits like that. Ma has always described herself as awkward, whereas I am quite sure of myself. I think that’s a lot to do with how she brought me up. If I was upset about anything, by the end of a conversation she’d make me feel proud of my south Asian heritage and who I am. My mum celebrates differences and that’s the way I’m trying to live my life.

4/23/2022,"My friend Stella Margaret Heath doesn’t suffer fools gladly – it’s what she’s known for, and she won’t mind my saying so. When I first met her, in the 80s, we were new undergraduates. I picked her to pair with for a philosophy assignment because she looked easy-going and enlightened (perm, jeans, thin white belt); it turned out she was neither. I discovered straight away that she’d read none of the summer reading list (and therefore cogito, ergo sum meant nothing to her) and only wanted to talk about timetabling restrictions at the polytechnic. We became good friends, best friends – me not minding her cynicism and untidiness; her ignoring my joie de vivre and shoplifting. Over the years, I’ve watched her become a brilliant, principled human being, and less and less tolerant of other human beings. I noticed just how much one rainy Christmas in the 2000s when, trapped at my house, with husbands and babies, my mother-in-law approached her with a paper wallet. “Would you like to see my holiday snaps, dear?” she said. “No, thank you,” said Stella, firmly, without looking up from her Anthony Trollope. I was astonished. Were you allowed to decline an old lady’s shots of baby dragonflies and a donkey sanctuary? My mother-in-law clearly thought not, and after the children were down for the night, she made a second attempt. “Did I show you these photographs?” she said, emphatically. Again, Stella refused to look, and so I had a third viewing to deflect any awkwardness. Later, I asked Stella: “Couldn’t you have just flicked through them, for my sake?” “No,” she said. “I hate other people’s pictures.” It has long seemed to me that the concept of female friendship has come to mean some kind of unerring, endlessly supportive kinship; or, if not, one of the friends will turn out to be some kind of psychopath. This has not been my experience, and it isn’t for the two main characters in my new novel – Susan and Norma. Sure, the friendship gets a bit rocky in parts, but I have always found it odd that, in fiction, siblings, romantic partners, parents, even neighbours are allowed to behave monstrously, but old girlfriends always have to be on their best behaviour. It’s been interesting to see the reaction to my depiction of the two friends – the competitiveness, letdowns and the brutal honesty, as well as the laughs and the boosting. Take my sister who, while reading the manuscript, texted me: “Norma is horrible!” and when I replied, “Viva Ferrante!” she texted back: “Poor Susan.” My grasp of the true meaning of friendship began at the age of eight when my first comrade suddenly went to America for the entire summer holidays, without warning, and came back overconfident. Appearing at our door in the September, in a baseball cap, she told my mother a joke – like some kind of man. I had two other significant childhood friends; one whose parents wouldn’t allow her to come round because of my parents’ divorce, and had a spiteful twin, and another who called me Stib of the Dump even though I’d asked her not to after the first time (which I admitted was funny). I was already a big reader, and it struck me hard that friends in real life never quite equalled the benign, dependable types encountered in books, like the saintly Ann, Jill’s best friend from Jill’s Gymkhana, who was forever defending Jill against the posh kids with flashy horse equipment. Are these fictional friends unrealistic, I wondered, or were my real ones a particularly poor lot? Then, as a teenager, I read The Country Girls and, thank God, here was a fun-loving pal who was also a selfish bitch. It felt good to have my rotten friends validated by Edna O’Brien. I have since enjoyed EF Benson and Elena Ferrante, whose female friends are pleasingly disagreeable and cut-throat. Recently, in spite of O’Brien and co, I’ve been questioning myself. Am I right to have hung on to the listless individuals I happened to sit near at college or work, in the 80s and 90s, who seemed like they might be useful if/when I needed someone to co-present a Descartes seminar, or to walk out to lunch with? Making friends was tricky, pre-internet; one couldn’t check out who else already liked them before committing. We had very little to go on; mainly their footwear, and willingness to make tea – it was a huge gamble. And so, as I say, I have this little gang that I’ve known almost all my adult life; though, to be frank, they don’t mix well, even among themselves, and if we met for the first time today, I’m not sure we’d bond. My correspondence habit and the fact that I can’t face great change is, I think, why I have doggedly clung on, however grim and untenable they have become. Maybe I should invite them to the friendship counselling my American pen pal recently mentioned, a sort of couples therapy but for jaded old buddies who keep “misreading” intentions and “bitching out on each other” (her words). “Our therapist showed us where the rifts were,” my friend told me, “and gave us the tools we need to keep the friendship nice.” God, how I’d love to watch her therapist’s Zoom face as I reminisce about Stella yelling at her son, in front of my new Cornish mum friends in the cafe at the Eden Project, “Just chew it, for God’s sake.” She was keen to stroll in the Mediterranean biome; he had accidentally chosen a lamb dish and suddenly understood the connection between the baby animal and the bloody bone on his plate. He was four. I’d also bring up the time she went to a pottery painting event with a different friend and made matching Mary, Queen of Scots mugs; and the heartbreak over her move from London to Southport, when she chose yet another friend (and the friend’s husband) to drive the rental van. And the time she karate-kicked my seven-year-old in the throat – albeit a kneejerk reaction to his tapping her on the head with a cat toy. And the day when, waiting in the car while I bought pasties in Greggs, she told my children (and hers) the facts of life (because one of them mentioned sex). It’s not just Stella – there’s also a friend I’ll call Julie, who used to allow her child to open a brand new bottle of ketchup at virtually every mealtime, because he “needed to” and, for the same reason, let him dunk chips into my son’s fried egg, and had nuggets and chips delivered to year 3 camp when all the others had baked beans. I’ve stuck with these friends despite it all. The source of my steadfastness can be found, I think, in early childhood and my instinct, in any given situation, to always do the exact opposite of my mother, who’d ditch her friends at the drop of a hat. I’ve a detailed memory of her dumping her friends, en masse, without even knowing she was doing it. She was freshly divorced and throwing a party to prove she’d survived. I remember, on the day, she read the guest list out loud: lifelong friends, cousins, girls with whom she’d shared a dorm at school, women with whom she’d simultaneously been boxed up for marriage, then pregnant, and pregnant again. With whom she’d had trips to the seaside, spent Christmas, Easter and Bonfire Night. Women whose mothers just wanted them to be happily married with children, and slim. This was her entire regiment. “Oh, God,” she said. “I literally can’t fucking stand any of them.” And because she said it just to us, her daughters, both under 10 and already in our party dresses, I knew she wasn’t joking. It was too late to cancel, and soon the caterer arrived – a woman called Madeline from up the road – and set to work on a huge poached salmon with its head still on, and assorted slaws. My mother was squeamish about the eyes and gills, so Madeline played them down with curly parsley – these were the days before the flat-leaf variety – and in so doing, gave it a look of Gilbert O’Sullivan, the 70s singer-songwriter. The party got going and the music went on early, and loud. My mother swallowed a pint of punch, wiped her mouth with her hand and then, thumbs in belt loops, she danced. Guests watched, between bites of Russian salad, as she jabbed at the smoky air with her elbows and sang slightly the wrong words. The dance was as profound as it was eloquent. “I’m not the person you used to know,” it said. “I’m no longer interested in picnics by streams, days out in Chapel St Leonards, or vinaigrettes. I want to take drugs with new friends, rebels like me, single, or with a game husband.” Madeline the caterer nodded her head to the beat as she hurriedly put the finishing touches to the puddings (gutted pineapples with brandy, cream and some kind of kibbled nut); then, pulling off her hairnet, she joined my mother and they really went for it. Many of the party guests rang the next day to say what a lovely time they’d had, but my mother couldn’t come to the phone, and wasn’t available ever again, except for funerals. A man friend did manage to get through to my mother, but only to complain about the caterer coming at him with a pitchfork for parking on her grass. “How do you know it was the caterer?” she asked. “She had a bunch of parsley in her hand,” he said. “Did she indeed?” said my mother. Madeline masqueraded as single but we discovered later that she had a husband who stayed upstairs. She also had triplets who had to share two pedal cars between the three of them. To be blunt, Madeline wasn’t that good a friend: she was self-centred, according to my mother, and when they chatted on the phone there’d be the sound of one child crying while the other two thundered about in their cars. One day, when she couldn’t stand it any more, my mother said, “I can’t believe you took that parsley home.” “Parsley?” said Madeline. “After catering my party?” said my mother. “I’d paid for that.” “The garnishes are never included,” spat Madeline. And just like that, Madeline was dropped. Ashort period of loneliness and heavy drinking followed, until she befriended married couple Liza and Peter Grosvenor, leading figures in the Shakespeare Drama Club, whom Madeline had introduced her to, and soon my mother was playing Viola in Twelfth Night, and never stopped boasting about her action creating all the play’s momentum. The Grosvenors sometimes invited us to dinner at their home and we saw for ourselves just how sophisticated they were. I can’t tell you what Liza looked like because she wore her hair in a long fringe that hid her eyes, but Peter looked like a cross between Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and political reformer William Cobbett, with a puff of grey-white hair, calico shirt and cravat. Dinner was always some kind of meat and potatoes, with salad to follow, served on rudimentary wooden platters that they’d brought home from Crete, and we had to be reminded not to saw into them too deeply with our knives. “These plates are very modern!” commented my sister one evening. “Modern?” said Liza. “Wooden plates are very ancient.” I’d noticed on a previous occasion that the plates weren’t to go in the washing-up water with everything else but were wiped over, gently, with an oily cloth, and though that was surely a clue as to their place in history, my sister must have missed it, and now she looked a complete idiot. One evening over a carafe of California wine, my mother asked Liza how she knew Madeline the caterer, and discovered Madeline had seen an advertisement for their secondhand baby equipment and had ended up taking the lot for her triplets, and from that, had inveigled her way into the drama club. “Even though she’d never heard of Shakespeare,” said Liza, scandalised. “Never heard of Shakespeare?” said my mother. “She’s a dropout,” explained Liza. “She must have dropped out very young,” said my mother. “Apparently so,” said an eavesdropping Peter. “It’s so refreshing.” Later Liza drunkenly confided to my mother that she and Peter were in a menage-a-trois with Madeline, and whispered details that I couldn’t hear. We stopped going round so much when my mother started a fling of her own with Peter and preferred to see him at our house, where she’d ply him with drink and goad him about Shakespeare’s modest Stratford origins, and raise doubts as to his authorship of certain works, citing the Earl of Oxford and Christopher Marlowe as more likely candidates, all of which seemed to arouse him. In truth, though, Peter was nothing without his enchanting family and wooden plates. Liza was affronted by the affair, even though she still had Madeline to fool about with, and we didn’t see her for some time, until she appeared one day, distraught. Peter had left her ... for Madeline. “For Madeline!” my mother yelped. “I know,” said Liza, staggering into the house. “It’s awful.” “How could he?” my mother was desperate to know. “I don’t know,” said Liza. With Peter out the way, they’d spend evenings playing Scrabble, which was fine until Liza began researching little-known two- and three-letter words, and was soon beating my mother in that strategic way, and gloating. “It’s not about the winning,” my mother said, “it’s about using up the hours until we die.” Liza apologised that she was exhausted; she’d been having counselling to help her come to terms with the Peter situation. My mother was dismissive, and reminded her that Peter had abandoned her, too. “How unkind of you to mention that,” said Liza. “You are calling me unkind,” said my mother, “when you humiliated a 10-year-old over those stupid plates?” “I suppose you’d be happy to let her waltz through life ignorant?” said unrepentant Liza. “You should ask for a refund on that therapy,” said my mother. “You’re more nuts than ever.” And that was that. Unlike my mother, I am not a ditcher of friends. I did it only once, and then only after the friend had broken the speed limit near a school and threatened to knit me a shawl, and though I’ve no regrets, it was painful at the time. I was ditched myself, too, around 1990, by a most wonderful pal. I’d joked about her, playfully, to a toxic telltale who wanted me out of the picture. (Sandra, you bitch, I’ll never forgive you.) I do, occasionally, imagine finding some new, improved friends who might share my views on the big questions of the day, tolerate my other pals, family and in-laws, put up with lumpy pillows, love the cinema, worship David Sedaris, endure my aimless chitchat and be prepared to lie to my husband about the price of a coat. But, on balance, I think I’m happy with my old ones. We know where we stand.  One Day I Shall Astonish the World by Nina Stibbe is published by Penguin Books at £14.99.

4/23/2022,"There’s a legend in south Texas involving the Monarch butterfly, the magnificent insect with the tiger markings. The Monarch typically arrives in the Rio Grande alley on its annual migratory trek in early November. That’s when people on both sides of the border celebrate Day of the Dead, a sacrosanct holiday in which residents honor dead relatives by visiting their gravesites and building elaborate altars in their memory. Legend has it that the butterflies carry the souls of the dead relatives as they make their way to the warmer climes of Mexico. In the past few years, that legend has been competing with disturbing and unfounded far-right conspiracy theories that the National Butterfly Center, a 100-acre sanctuary for the Monarchs and other species on the banks of the Rio Grande, is the site of child sexual abuse trafficking and illegal immigration. As the misinformation crescendo grew, driven by the hot-button issue of immigration, the center closed its doors in February. Far-right conspiracists and QAnon followers targeted the center and threatened violence because it opposed the construction of Trump’s border wall based on its impact on the surrounding habitat. Today, the center will reopen to the public in honor of Earth Day, which was celebrated on Friday. The saga of the Monarch sanctuary is yet another example from this golden age of disinformation – from the Senate committee members who painted US supreme court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson as soft on child pornographers to the Michigan congresswoman crediting President Trump with having caught Osama bin Laden to Russia claiming that growing evidence of military atrocities in Ukraine are staged. But the type of disinformation that is plaguing the National Butterfly Center resonates in border communities because violence is not merely a threat here, but a reality –measurable in the deaths of 23 people and 23 others who were wounded. It happened more than two years ago in an El Paso Walmart. Patrick Wood Crusius drove all night from his home in Allen, Texas, more than 600 miles away, to target Hispanics in a mass shooting. In a manifesto, Crusius spoke of the “Hispanic invasion of Texas”. These concerns over border violence are now bolstered by a recent report by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) that radical right extremism in the past year has “coalesced into a political movement that is now one of the most powerful forces shaping politics in the United States”. The report goes on to say: “In the year since the (January 6) insurrection, this hard-right movement – made up of hate and extremist groups, Trump loyalists, right-wing thinktanks, media organizations and committed activists with institutional power – has worked feverishly to undermine democracy, with real-world consequences for the people and groups they target.” Ironically, this political force shows momentum at a time when the number of organized hate groups in the US is declining, dropping to 733 in 2021 from a high of 1,020 in 2018, according to the report. But the decline of organized hate groups should not be comforting because, as the SPLC noted, it marks a movement in which extreme ideology – and the threat of violence – is becoming more mainstream. It could potentially spawn the lone actors who might be willing to drive all night to commit violent acts. Before the butterfly sanctuary was closed, executive director Marianna Treviño-Wright reported being assaulted when Virginia congressional candidate Kimberly Lowe entered the grounds of the center in search of “illegals” and was asked to leave. The confrontation was captured on audio. The irony is that the only documented violence on the property would be domestic, not from immigrants. In fact, the butterfly center is the essence of tranquility. Once an onion field, this site was chosen as a sanctuary because it was at a migratory crossroad. The center planted or cultivated more than 200 species of nectar- and host-based plants, including milkweed and sage bushes, that attract the butterflies, which are free-roaming and not captured. Annual census counts of butterflies have documented more than 240 species and recorded more than 200,000 butterflies representing 100 species in a single day. The center became a target of extremists when a national group led by former Trump aide Steve Bannon and the organization “We Build a Wall” set up a toehold on land adjacent to the sanctuary. As organizers tried to raise money for a private border wall on social media, the story was born of children being smuggled through the center for sex trafficking. The posts were always accompanied by a plea to send money. The head of “We Build the Wall”, Brian Kolfage, and Bannon were indicted on fraud charges last year. stemming from the estimated $25m raised by the organization. On Thursday, Kolfage and co-defendant Andrew Badolato pleaded guilty in federal court to defrauding donors of hundreds of thousands of dollars and filing a false tax return. Concerned that the wall was not structurally sound so close to the river, the butterfly center sued to dismantle it, saying that a major flood event could send the wall tumbling into the water and have a catastrophic effect on neighboring lands. They also included defamation charges related to the sex ring allegations. The legal cases are creeping through federal court, allowing the social media attacks to fester. A gathering of ultra-conservatives in south Texas precipitated the confrontation with Lowe, who was ultimately banned from attending the gathering because of the negative attention she brought. Treviño-Wright said the re-opening of the butterfly center comes with some trepidation, even after implementing security recommendations from a consulting firm. “We decided to open with the understanding that nobody can ever feel safe again,” she said. “Not those people in El Paso who just wanted to go shopping at their Walmart or those police officers and staff members who just wanted to go to their jobs at the Capitol on January 6.” Carlos Sanchez is director of public affairs for Hidalgo county, Texas.

4/23/2022,"For customers at the Apothecarium dispensary, one of 13 medicinal marijuana stores in New Jersey, 4/20, the unofficial celebration of all things marijuana, came a day late. On Thursday, 21 April, recreational use of cannabis was legalized throughout New Jersey, allowing anyone 21 or older to legally purchase marijuana. At Apothecarium, tucked between a smoothie bar and a cafe in Maplewood, hundreds arrived to buy weed legally for the very first time in New Jersey, just a hop and a skip – or a bridge or tunnel – away from New York City. Arriving in groups or solo, young and old came to celebrate what many described as a long-awaited step in making marijuana more accessible. “Today is absolutely historic,” said 41-year-old Jason Sommers, an Apothecarium employee who worked as security for the dispensary’s first day serving recreational customers. “Those who indulge in cannabis have been waiting for this day for a very long time and now that it’s here. It’s beautiful,” Sommers added, wearing a plain black T-shirt and excitedly greeting customers as they first arrived. Maplewood police stood in front of the dispensary, helping to direct traffic and point out parking for eager buyers. Under sunny skies, customers were greeted by uniformed dispensary employees giving out tote bags, lighters, free T-shirts and other goodies. “[This is] probably one of the most exciting days for all of our staff and all of our customers,” said Chantelle Elsner, senior vice-president of retail at TerrAscend, the company that owns Apothecarium, trying to speak over the noise of customers enthusiastically entering the dispensary for the first time. After checking in online, those waiting to buy could either amble around to businesses in the area or wait in a tented parking lot across from the dispensary. Once inside, the dispensary was sectioned off for recreational buyers versus Apothecarium’s typical medicinal patients. Some walked around, checking out glass display cases featuring strains of “grease monkey”, a hybrid blend, “strawnana”, a relaxing indica bud, and other cannabis products. Cannabis oil, pre-rolled joints, and bud were available to Apothecarium’s first recreational use customers, with edible availability coming soon. “It’s like going to a candy store for the first time. You look around and you see,” said student Princeton Goode, 36, who waited in the parking lot with his girlfriend and friend. William Walker, 67, and his wife Debra came from the area to buy recreationally hoping that cannabis could address some of their chronic pain, specifically in Walker’s knees and eyes. “If it ease some of it, it’s good. If it doesn’t, at least I tried,” said Walker as his wife nodded. Walker, who’s happy about New Jersey’s legalization, joked that the only downside was a possible increase in robberies “beyond the fact that kids may rob you if they think that you have some”. Novices and weed enthusiasts alike shared mutual excitement at the new law, the product of a decade-long fight by New Jersey cannabis advocates to catch up with many other US states and end its criminalization. New Jersey voters first approved of legalizing cannabis in a referendum in 2020. A year later, state legislators, under the Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, legalized recreational use and purchase of it, processing dispensary applications and crafting regulations for the budding industry. At least 18 other states and Washington DC have now legalized recreational marijuana, with 37 states in total allowing marijuana to be bought for medicinal purposes. Many fewer are on the east coast and New Jersey is among the first to start recreational sales. New York, where recreational cannabis was legalized last year, still has not launched a licensed recreational market. “So many people have been ostracized for using cannabis throughout the country, but it’s finally amazing to see New Jersey do something legal about it,” said self-described “chill guy” Julio Morales-Carrera, 28. Sales from cannabis also infuse state coffers with extra revenue, via taxes on sales. Murphy in 2019 projected recreational cannabis sales would add $60m in state revenue. New Jersey officials say that taxes from marijuana sales will be allocated to Black and brown communities that have been disproportionately impacted by decades of marijuana criminalization. “If they use the money correctly, that could help with anything the state needs, the municipality needs,” said 29-year-old customer and self-proclaimed weed enthusiast Roberto Severini. For many, especially Black cannabis users, a major benefit from now being able to buy from a dispensary is the ability to not face persecution or stigma for buying cannabis, as Black people are four times as likely to be arrested under marijuana possession laws as white people. “It’s a huge difference coming out and being able to walk in a store and not feel like you’re doing something wrong. That’s like the biggest thing for me,” said 40-year-old Chris, a sales professional, who preferred not to have his last name disclosed. Kinley Louis, a New Jersey resident, who was waiting with his co-worker and chatting with other keen cannabis buyers, agreed about feeling less anxious while buying at the dispensary. “You don’t got to worry about being persecuted for flowers any more and on top of that, you don’t have to worry about going to ‘sketch places’ trying to buy it,” Louis said, referring to cannabis buds. Even with the increased cost of marijuana in a dispensary compared with buying off the street, most noted that it was worth it given better quality, ease of access, and knowing exactly what they were getting. “Maybe the price is a little bit different, but the quality is probably way better too, said 26-year-old Jessica Jones, who added: “It’s a different experience and smoother.” Jonathan Ortiz, a cancer survivor, said he would apply to work at the dispensary. “[It’s about] knowing all the products, what’s inside the products, the option of different products, and the safety of it all. At least you know who to come to if something goes wrong,” he said. By mid-afternoon, while the early morning waves of buyers had shrunk, people’s enthusiasm was palpable. Those waiting in line for their chance to purchase bonded with people who had successfully gotten their goods. A man in a red hoodie danced alone to Silk Sonic’s Smokin Out the Window in the dispensary’s parking lot before joining his friends as they waited for a text confirming they could enter the dispensary. Bursts of laughter and cheers filled the air, with those driving by the dispensary line asking for parking information so they too could purchase. “It’s a beautiful thing. It’s real beautiful,” said Goode.",News/US news,‘Today is absolutely historic’: legal marijuana sales roll out in New Jersey,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/23/new-jersey-legal-marijuana-sales
4/23/2022,"It’s 9am in San Francisco’s Tenderloin district and sleeping bodies line the sidewalks as Felanie Castro sets out on her route in Glide Memorial church’s harm reduction van. Along Ellis Street, hungry people queue up for the church’s daily breakfast of buns, hard-boiled eggs and plastic-wrapped muffins. Down the block, a fire department truck, part of a city response team, awaits the day’s first drug overdose call. This neighborhood and the adjoining South of Market (SoMa) district have become ground zero in an opioid overdose crisis that is killing thousands of California residents, including many experiencing homelessness. In the past two years, more than 1,300 people have died of overdoses in San Francisco, a rise driven by the emergence of fentanyl, a super-potent synthetic opioid that’s 50 times stronger than heroin. Nearly half of those deaths have occurred in these two hard-hit neighborhoods alone. Castro and Glide’s harm reduction team are fighting one front in the battle to keep people alive. Glide, a nearly century-old church, has been advocating for the rights of the poor and disenfranchised communities since the 1960s. Today the church runs dozens of programs, including support for those struggling with homelessness and addiction. Armed with supplies such as clean syringes, glass pipes, alcohol wipes and bottles of water, their team aims to give people the health tools to make drug use as safe as possible, while working to build the trust that drug users may need to eventually seek help. Among the most powerful tools in their arsenal are nasal spray bottles of Narcan, each containing 4mg of the life-saving opioid-reversal drug naloxone. Castro says she has already reversed 50 overdoses using Narcan, in the Tenderloin and around the city. But she can’t save everyone alone. As part of a broader harm reduction strategy, providers are offering Narcan at clinics, meal programs and homeless drop-in centers and distributing it directly into the hands of drug users and anyone living around them, increasing the chances someone can act. “The idea is to have Narcan available everywhere,” said Laura Guzman, a senior director at the National Harm Reduction Coalition. . As the Glide outreach van pulls up to a collection of tarps and tents under the shadows of a freeway overpass that morning, Castro and her partner, Rizzy Spoer, call out to the occupants, who appear to be sleeping inside. “Hi, sorry to bother you. We’re from Glide. We have harm reduction supplies and basic needs stuff. Do you need anything?” A bearded young man in a baseball cap comes out and asks if he can have some “longs” and some “shorts”, referring to two different sizes of syringes. Castro loads a paper bag with the supplies and offers some water. Then she calls to the soft-spoken young man as he turns to go back to the tent: “And also, do you have any Narcan in there?” The man gratefully takes a single-dose Narcan dispenser wrapped in foil packaging. The Tenderloin, a historic neighborhood in the heart of San Francisco’s downtown, comprises roughly 50 square blocks, most built just after the 1906 earthquake. During the 20th century its gently sloping streets and residential hotels developed a reputation as the city’s seedy underbelly, known for drug dealing, sex work and vice. Today the Tenderloin is grappling with the interlocking crises of homelessness, poverty and addiction. It’s home to hundreds of people trying to survive without housing, many living just steps from glitzy high-rise apartments, luxury brand shops, and the headquarters of tech companies such as Twitter and Uber. The city supervisor Matt Haney, who represents and lives in the district, describes it as a place of last resort for people who have fallen through the social safety net. “The Tenderloin is a place where people who have been pushed out, stepped on and who are struggling can find a home and refuge,” he said. “That’s a powerful and beautiful thing. It also brings with it a lot of need.” In recent years, new forces have intensified those challenges. One is the rise of fentanyl, now the substance of choice for many illicit drug users in San Francisco. Another is soaring rents and a statewide housing crisis that experts say has pushed even more people on to the streets. Resolving the situation has become one of the city’s most divisive issues. Facing mounting pressure to act, San Francisco’s mayor, London Breed, declared a “state of emergency” in the Tenderloin in December 2021 – promising a crackdown on drug dealers, more interventions for users and cleaner streets. The declaration reignited a debate at the heart of drug addiction treatment: should users be given “tough love” and urged to abstain from drug use? Or should the city make drug use safer and help people rebuild their lives at their own pace? Opinions range, with some in favor of the abstinence-based approach, a philosophy often associated with America’s “war on drugs” era, and some who want the city to use a firmer hand to clear the Tenderloin of visible drug use and encampments. In contrast, harm reduction advocates say widely accepted scientific evidence shows this strategy is ineffective at reducing addiction in the long term. In addition to placing people in supportive housing, they believe the city should open supervised spaces for people to use drugs, so they can receive prompt medical attention in the case of an overdose. Slowly building relationships, they say, helps people get into treatment and ultimately heal. “Harm reduction is sort of the flip side of criminalizing drug use,” said Glide Memorial church’s CEO, Karen Hanrahan. “We practice harm reduction to save lives and to reduce disease, but also because it builds relationships with people who we can then wrap our arms around and help them through a continuum of other services that they need.” Harm reduction started as an underground movement distributing clean needles to drug users during the Aids epidemic of the 1980s, said Dr Daniel Ciccarone, a professor specializing in addiction medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. The mantra, at a time “when injection drug users and men who had sex with men were not only ignored, but were vilified”, says Ciccarone, “was meeting people where they’re at – not judging them, not disciplining them, not telling them what they needed to do.” Those principles now form much of what we think of as drug treatment, he said, from the use of medicines like methadone and buprenorphine to help wean people from opioids, to the counseling that helps people rebuild their sense of dignity. And for the first time, harm reduction became part of federal policy when the Biden administration included it as a pillar of its plan to stem national overdose deaths. “It started scrappy; it started low-budget and it started underground,” said Ciccarone, who worked with street activists in the 1980s trying to stop the spread of Aids. “It has grown to become legitimate, accepted, funded and politically approved.” Proponents of harm reduction are putting their methods up against one of the greatest tests yet as fentanyl floods the US drug market. In California, the number of fatalities attributed to fentanyl jumped by more than 2,100% in five years. In San Francisco, overdose deaths hit a new high of 711 during the first year of the pandemic, with those experiencing homelessness facing some of the highest mortality rates. According to Alex Kral, who has been interviewing opioid users for decades as part of his work with the non-profit research institute RTI International, many heroin users have switched over to fentanyl – which is being both injected and smoked – because it’s a cheaper and quicker high. But the drug’s extreme potency means that even longtime opioid users can quickly go into a breath-stopping overdose. That’s made distributing Narcan even more urgent. While there’s no silver bullet for the crisis, experts say many more would be dying without it. For example, in 2021, after climbing precipitously for three years, the number of overdose deaths in the city decreased slightly to 650, a period that coincided with Narcan resuscitations ramping up significantly – from 4,300 in 2020 to 8,200 in 2021. . Several months ago, Laurie Rudner, a former Tenderloin resident, saw for herself just how fast fentanyl can take someone out. A friend was sitting in front of her in a wheelchair when he took a hit of the drug. Almost instantly, she saw the drink he was holding drop out of his hand. Fortunately, Rudner had been given some Narcan. She pulled it out of her bag, and she and another friend rushed to their fallen companion and squirted the Narcan up his nose. An ambulance arrived quickly and administered several more doses of the antidote and, pretty soon, Rudner’s friend was breathing again and on his way to the hospital. “The main problem right now is fentanyl,” said Rudner. “There have been like two deaths a day.” While the drug is killing everyone from Hollywood celebrities to high school teenagers, it has posed a particular threat to people experiencing homelessness, driving a doubling of deaths among this group during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a UCSF study. One big difference between the late 1990s and now, said Kral, is that back then only about 30% of all injection drug users surveyed considered themselves homeless. Today, the figure is 75% to 80%. He believes the difference is that much of the cheap, marginal housing – like $20-a-night hotels, warehouse spaces and abandoned buildings – has disappeared and been replaced by high-rise condominium buildings fetching top dollar from tech industry employees. “People no longer have places to be,” he said. Reginald Dillard Sr, 65, says what he sees happening on the streets now terrifies him. Born in San Francisco, he has lived in the Bay Area his whole life. After his family lost their West Oakland home in the 2008 housing crash, Dillard said, “I did a few too many drugs and I ended up on the sidewalk.” Dillard spent years living on the streets in the Tenderloin before he got help from a city caseworker and, four years ago, moved into a subsidized one-room apartment in an old Tenderloin hotel. Now he surveys the street scene around Glide from a distance, looking sharp in a white and blue windbreaker, jeans and a baseball cap. “I’m scared to death of fentanyl,” he said. “It don’t take but a match head’s worth of that stuff to put you out for good.” Twenty-nine-year-old Eletise Niumata has experienced those dangers first hand. Sitting in a wheelchair a few blocks from Glide church, she places pink fentanyl powder on a square of tin foil and holds a lighter underneath, inhaling the rising fumes through a straw-like tube. Between puffs, Niumata explains that her name means “electricity” in her ancestral homeland of Samoa, a place she visited twice while growing up in San Francisco. In recent years, both she and her younger sister have faced homelessness. She’s been trying to get into housing, but hasn’t managed to yet. Niumata says she’s overdosed and been revived by naloxone two or three times. With Narcan, “everybody can help out. If you need some, probably somebody has it.” Recently, the city opened a “linkage center” in the Tenderloin, providing a place for those without housing to get respite and hook up with services such as treatment and housing referrals. The center offers hot meals, restrooms and showers – and people are allowed to use drugs in a fenced outdoor area, a decision that not everyone agrees with. Since the linkage center opened in January, 35 drug overdoses have been caught and reversed with Narcan, according to a statement from the city’s health department. Finding housing for people who visit the center has been a much slower process. The city’s website shows that as of 10 April, the linkage center has received 28,984 visits and provided 1,220 referrals to services, yet the city’s housing data for the project show only 99 people have gotten housing, with another 71 placed on a priority list. The linkage center made an additional 366 placements into temporary shelter beds. In Glide Memorial’s outreach van, Felanie Castro is trying to make a difference one visit a time. The van comes equipped to provide testing for Covid-19, HIV, hepatitis C and a variety of sexually transmitted diseases. The team also passes out lots of bottled water, feminine supplies, snacks, and self-heating meal kits, in varieties like “rotini and kielbasa sausage in a spicy sauce”. Smoking supplies, including tin foil, straws and glass pipes, are increasingly in demand. Distributing the materials has raised controversy at the federal level – after conservatives erroneously charged that federal money was going to be used to pass out “crack pipes”. But no federal funding goes to glass pipes, and Castro dismisses criticism that her work encourages drug use. “We’re not just here to give out stuff,” she said. “Everything we do out here is public health. We want to lower the barriers to getting help. That’s my job: lowering the barriers to physical health or mental health.” Once a week, a doctor from the city of San Francisco’s street medicine team rides along in the harm reduction van and offers medical services to anyone who wants them. The mobile doctors are even able to start people on drug-assisted treatment, a method favored by harm reduction specialists, that can help them get off opioids without the excruciating withdrawal symptoms. Frank Vaccari, who now lives in a residence hotel in the Tenderloin, credits the earliest form of medication-assisted treatment available in the United States, methadone, with getting him off heroin and off the streets more than two decades ago. “I couldn’t get off cold turkey,” he said “When I tried, it was horrible. You couldn’t eat. You couldn’t sleep. You’re throwing up. Your eyes are ready to pop out of your skull. The physical effects go on for weeks. Then there’s the mental effects.” Vaccari, 63, goes to the methadone clinic three days a week to pick up his treatment, which comes in the form of a pink syrup, which he said “tastes nasty, but works real good” to stave off withdrawals. Many other people he knows have died of overdoses. In January, Vaccari found his younger brother dead of a fentanyl overdose in his own apartment. As Vaccari steps out on to the Tenderloin’s Eddy Street in his purple pajama pants to give his chihuahua, Cleo, a quick walk, he credits the harm reduction philosophy for keeping him alive. “Methadone saved my life,” Vaccari said. “I would have been dead years ago.”",News/US news,The daily battle to keep people alive as fentanyl ravages San Francisco’s Tenderloin,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/23/san-francisco-homelessness-street-team-fentanyl
