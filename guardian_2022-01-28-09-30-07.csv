1/28/2022,"Alisson was twice sent off and reprieved by VAR in Brazil’s wild and chaotic 1-1 draw with Ecuador in a World Cup qualifier. The Liverpool goalkeeper somehow managed to complete the game in Quito, during which two players were given their marching orders inside the opening 20 minutes.  Casemiro put Brazil ahead in the fifth minute when he hammered home from close range after a goalmouth scramble before the red cards started coming out. The Ecuador goalkeeper Alexander Domínguez was sent off for a reckless challenge before the Tottenham right-back Emerson Royal was dismissed for a second yellow card following a clumsy challenge. Alisson was handed his first lifeline on the the half-hour when he caught Enner Valencia in the face with a high boot. The referee was sent to the pitchside monitor and downgraded the initial red card to yellow after replays showed the keeper had kicked the ball first. VAR saves Alisson from being this game's third red card! ❌It's downgraded to a yellow card by the referee, the Liverpool keeper stays on, and it's still 10 v 10 🟨What a half so far! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/dpDkK3eZKg Felix Torres headed Ecuador’ level 15 minutes from time and the hosts looked to have a chance to win the tie in stoppage time when they were awarded a penalty after Alisson appeared to punch one of their players as he bore down on goal. The Brazil keeper was shown a second yellow card, before the decision was again overturned on the advice of VAR. For the second time in the match the referee ruled Alisson had played the ball first, but on both occasions he could consider himself fortunate. 😱😱 Alisson gives away a stoppage time penalty AND is given a second yellow card......but VAR ultimately intervenes and saves him for a second time in the game! 😅What a dramatic end to this game 😵 pic.twitter.com/SOtmWOCBXT Brazil, the five-times world champions, have already qualified for this year’s finals in Qatar along with Argentina.

1/28/2022,"Boris Johnson has been accused of taking a reckless approach to public health by lifting all plan B Covid restrictions in England while failing to take enough action to get jabs to 3 billion unvaccinated people in poorer countries. The prime minister has robustly defended his record on the pandemic this week while awaiting the findings of the Sue Gray report on the “partygate” scandal, insisting he “got the big calls right” on the biggest global health crisis in a century.  But now more than 300 leading scientists, health experts and academics have said his failure to take sufficient action to boost vaccination levels worldwide means it is more likely new variants will put thousands of lives at risk across the UK. “We write to you as scientists, academics, and public health experts concerned about the emergence of the Omicron variant and the threat that future variants may pose to public health, the NHS, and the UK’s vaccination programme,” they said in a two-page letter delivered to 10 Downing Street. “Vaccinating the vast majority of the world’s population is the best way to prevent Sars-CoV-2 from mutating. However, as the UK has provided booster doses to up to 1 million people every day, more than 3 billion people across the world have yet to receive their first dose. More boosters have been delivered in rich countries than the total number of all doses administered so far in poorer nations. “Allowing huge numbers of people in low- and middle-income countries to remain unvaccinated is a reckless approach to public health that creates conditions where new Sars-CoV-2 variants of concern are more likely to develop.” The letter has been signed in a personal capacity by 13 members of Johnson’s Sage committee and subcommittees, a fellow at the UK Health Security Agency and an adviser to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Nigel Crisp, the former chief executive of the NHS in England, Nobel prize winner Sir Richard Roberts, and several World Health Organization advisers are also among the signatories. They called on Johnson to allow low- and middle-income countries to manufacture Covid vaccines, tests, and treatments for themselves. Vaccinating the vast majority of the world’s population was the best way to prevent further coronavirus variants of concern, they added, including variants that could be more infectious or render current vaccines less effective. They urged the prime minister to put public health before the interests of the pharmaceutical industry “to prevent another year of uncertainty and tragedy” by supporting international efforts to suspend intellectual property rules that stop lower-income nations from manufacturing vaccines, tests, and treatments. Vaccines will not be effective at stopping new variants of concern from arising “unless we share this technology with the world and increase global vaccination coverage”, they added in the letter coordinated by science and health experts working with groups including Global Justice Now. Crisp said: “Throughout this pandemic, the government has pledged that it will follow the science. The scientific evidence has been clear since the start of the pandemic that the best way to keep ourselves and our NHS safe from new variants is to vaccinate the world. “However laudable donations of vaccines might be, they will never be enough to end the pandemic. There is untapped manufacturing capacity in the very nations that need vaccines and treatments most. For the sake of people’s lives in those countries and our own, we must use it.” Laura Merson, associate director of the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory at the University of Oxford, said protection provided by boosters would be “critically limited” while most of the world remained unvaccinated. “The easing of plan B restrictions may give the impression that the pandemic is coming to an end,” she said. “But this won’t be over until we address the risk of new variants at the root – in populations that have not had access to vaccines.” Maryam Shahmanesh, professor of global health at UCL, added: “By ignoring the demands of low- and middle-income countries and stifling global vaccine production with arbitrary intellectual property rules, the government risks prolonging the pandemic and endangering countless lives. We need a complete step-change if we are to bring this pandemic to an end for everyone.”",News/World news,Lifting England Covid rules while 3bn people unvaccinated reckless – experts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/uk-covid-vaccine-stance-global-vaccination-levels-reckless-experts
1/28/2022,"Good morning, happy Friday and welcome to Five Great Reads, your weekday, summertime wrap of intriguing interviews, incisive analysis and, today at least, Beach Boys tracks. I’m Alyx Gorman, lifestyle editor of Guardian Australia, and I’m here to Do It Again until Summer’s Almost Gone. If you’d rather be reading the news as it unfolds, our live blog is the place for that and if you’re after day two of the Women’s Ashes, we’ve got live coverage of that too. Meanwhile, if you’re looking for something to binge-watch this weekend, Sian Cain suggests Alone, which sounds awful but is actually brilliant. Now, let’s get reading.  Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan talking for four hours is ... quite something. During an interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Peterson, whose scientific background is in psychology, criticised climate modelling in what one scientist whose field is actually climate science dubbed “a word salad of nonsense”. Notable quote: “He seems to think we model the future climate the same way we do the weather,” says climate scientist Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick. “He sounds intelligent, but he’s completely wrong.” Why should I care about this? Because Rogan’s show is Spotify’s most listened to podcast, topping the charts in Australia, the US and the UK. Further reading: Climate scientists aren’t the only ones speaking out about the content of Rogan’s shows at the moment. Neil Young pulled his music from the platform this week over false Covid claims that aired on the podcast and earlier this month, 270 experts signed an open letter labelling Rogan “a menace to public health”. “Mass misinformation events of this scale have extraordinarily dangerous ramifications,” the experts wrote.

Following the release of their new record, Sancho, and on the eve of a national tour, he sits down with Bernard Zuel to talk grief, “sad songs about blokes” and finding meaning. Shock reveal: Given the magnitude of the Whitlams’ 2000 hit Blow Up the Pokies, what Freedman’s been doing in his time off is an eyebrow raiser. “I was on the periphery of horse racing culture and, to be honest, I was a full-time gambler for four years,” Freedman says. “I’ve never talked about it because I’m the guy who wrote Blow Up the Pokies, why would I be a gambler?” How long will it take me to read? Just under three minutes Immigrants from Germany, Switzerland and Austria are seeking to build “paradise” in one of Paraguay’s poorest regions. Although the settlement is troubling locals, it seems to be gaining political power. Notable quote: “Why are they here? We don’t know, but we want to find out,” said Rodney Mereles, a former municipal councillor. Key background: “Paraguay has a long and sometimes troubled history of inward-looking immigrant colonies driven by ideological and religious zeal,” writes William Costa. “Settlement projects by Mennonites, Australian socialists and the Unification church among others have all left marks on the country.” How long will it take me to read? Two and a half minutes. In the UK, a large longitudinal study of sex suggests that Covid has killed the one-night stand. “There is a theory that a decline in random sexual encounters might indicate a new age of inhibition or sexual moralising,” writes Zoe Williams. “But it looks as if the opposite is true.” Open to experiments: “You used to be able to categorise people,” says sex toy retailer Julia Margo, whose business is seeing a spike in sales of stocking gags and dog leads. “To me, these were really niche products. But they are so popular – and it’s the same people who are buying normal vibrators.” Meanwhile the 55-plus demographic’s gone all in on BDSM sex furniture. “There’s huge experimenting in this age bracket – and they’re spending real money on their sex lives.” How long will it take me to read?

1/28/2022,"The end of the beginning of the Matildas’ Asian Cup campaign has been reached. Now the fun starts. Emily van Egmond’s 39th-minute strike, supplemented by Sam Kerr’s cheeky capitalisation on a goalkeeping error with 10 minutes to go, secured a relatively benign 2-1 win over Thailand. Claiming top spot in Group B with a perfect three wins from three games, including an 18-0 win over Indonesia and a 4-0 triumph over the Philippines, the Matildas will now head into the quarter-finals with 23 goals scored and one goal conceded – much to their chagrin.  “I’m happy at how upset the team was after the game. They were upset about the goal that we conceded in injury time,” coach Tony Gustavsson said of Nipawan Panyosuk 93rd-minute consolation goal for Thailand. With the group stage now concluded, Australia’s women must now prepare for a step up in quality in the fixtures that follow, starting with South Korea in the quarter-finals on Sunday. The Matildas have been quick to acknowledge the need to respect all their opponents – one of the justifications provided for not easing off the gas against Indonesia – and the upcoming contests could be said to mark the true beginning of their bid for continental supremacy. Given the still-nascent stages of growth in most Asian nations, there are effectively two tiers of teams at the Asian Cup. In one resides the likes of Japan, China, and Australia – sides that are regular competitors at a World Cup level and enter every continental competition with genuine aspirations of winning it. For these teams, there is scope to use group stage games with lesser-heralded sides as forums for preparation for potential knockout clashes. As has become increasingly obvious with each passing game, Gustavsson has used the first three games to do just that – even if the opening 45 minutes against the Philippines left a bit to be desired. With the introduction of Emily Gielnik in the 75th minute against Thailand, all 23 members of his squad – including the three goalkeepers – have now seen minutes at some point. Some players have been able to fill in other positions and the squad has been managed in a way that has brought them up to a requisite level of fitness for the challenges to come, despite the disparate nature of player’s conditioning heading into the tournament. “The sport science department and sports medicine, together with the players and the technical staff, have done a phenomenal planning job behind the scenes – put a lot of hours looking into some players that haven’t played for a month,” Gustavsson said. “Some players needed heavy minutes in the beginning and then have a little bit of rest today and some players we needed to be careful with in the beginning of the tournament to not get them injured to play more today. I’m extremely impressed and happy how we’ve been able to manage plays throughout the group stage.” Gustavsson’s lineup against Thailand was packed with youth, but he had come in for criticism after selecting XIs loaded with veteran and established talent against Indonesia and the Philippines – ostensibly games in which young players with potential to grow into 2023 could have benefitted from low-risk international exposure. Yet is should come as no surprise how the group stage has played out. Gustavsson has approached the opening games in India with the clear purpose of preparing his squad to peak in a manner that he believes will deliver silverware. Having come under scrutiny for his side’s performances across their slate of 2021 friendlies, nor should it surprise that Gustavsson’s “performance mode” bears little resemblance to his “preparation mode” – not when he has effectively staked his job on the former producing results. This has raised his side’s chances of performing in the games to come, but it has also created a certain level of expectation. Having nailed his colours to the “performance” mast, Gustavsson must now demonstrate his approach is not only capable of laying waste to the likes of Indonesia, but also to Asia’s best.",Sport/Football,Matildas turn focus to main event with straightforward Asian Cup group stage completed | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/28/matildas-turn-focus-to-main-event-with-straightforward-asian-cup-group-stage-completed
1/28/2022,"Burger giant McDonalds is causing something of a flap with a bizarre new set of forthcoming ‘menu hacks’ that includes a sandwich called “Land, Air & Sea,” combining fish, beef and a bird with dismal flying abilities – the chicken.  Menu hacks have in recent years become a popular way for the public to customize creations from existing items on fast food chain menus. For a limited period starting from 31 January, McDonalds will sell four hacks that have been unofficially popularized in recent years by fans, including Land, Air & Sea – a chicken sandwich, Big Mac and Filet-O-Fish together – and the Crunchy Double, a double cheeseburger filled with six chicken nuggets. However, the components will be sold as separate sandwiches and customers will have to unwrap them and build them themselves. The fast food chain’s announcement has since been met with a variety of reactions online, including at the low end outrage, shock and disgust. “Three-quarters of those McDonald’s ‘menu hacks’ make me deeply uncomfortable because I can only see them as something you’d put together alone in your dark kitchen when your depression is at absolute rock bottom,” one person tweeted. Another wrote: “McDonald’s new menu ‘hacks’ include the ‘Land, Air & Sea,’ which at 1330 calories probably can be ordered as ‘The Widow-maker.’ Skip the fries, order an accompanying cholesterol test.” Those 1330 calories includes 69 grams of fat, 19 grams of sugar, 2150 milligrams of sodium, 123 grams of total carbs and 160 milligrams of cholesterol, or 53% of one’s daily values based on a 2,000 calorie diet. The “air” element, meanwhile should be a deeply ironic reminder that chickens could fly well until humans domesticated and bred them so that their wings are too small and their flight muscles – the breast meat – too large. One user called out the apparent lack of creativity behind McDonald’s ‘hacks,’ tweeting, “@McDonalds So what’s the point of the ‘McDonald’s Menu Hacks’ if you’re not making the sandwich for us?” Rival chain Wendy’s tweeted: “You guys know these are cheeseburgers and not an entertainment center from IKEA, right?”",News/Business,"McDonald’s new ‘menu hack’ includes a ‘Land, Air & Sea’ burger",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/27/mcdonalds-new-menu-land-air-sea-burger
