Ada One of the reasons I wanted to do this is because I live in a sheltered, middle-class area of Oxfordshire. I don’t even have a gay person who’s a friend where I live. I wanted to expand my horizons, so having a pleasant lunch with Rebecca was just the ticket. Rebecca As a trans person, I think about this: are there lots of anti-trans people, or just a small number of very vocal ones? Can trans people overreact? Yes, of course, sometimes. Ada I had the calamari and then a fish pie. Rebecca Oh gosh, I had steak and chips. I don’t know why I chose it – my daughter’s a vegan so I wouldn’t normally. Ada I think self-identification is fine. I don’t believe in the trope that people are going to self-identify as the other sex so they can commit crimes. My beef is with sports. I’m afraid that it’s very one-sided – trans women, especially in America, are starting to take part in athletics, and rarely the other way around. You don’t see many trans men participating in men’s soccer. I’m sorry, but it’s not fair. Rebecca I can totally get why that’s an issue. But also, is it not everyone’s right to take part in sport? So it’s not straightforward. Trans people don’t want to destroy women’s sport, as a whole. I wouldn’t want to. I do parkruns, and I put down female. I’ve probably knocked somebody from 500th place to 501st. Should I have put down my natal gender? Ada I think my viewpoint has mellowed somewhat, because of my degree. I had to do a project recently on a trans patient. As a future nurse, I could very well be treating a person from this community. And as I looked into the research, it’s given me more perspective. Rebecca Trans rights have become a symbol of culture wars, and we’re caught in the middle of all this. If the media starts framing trans people as bad people, and putting them at the centre of bad events, it’s like making out gay people are all sexual predators. Has any trans person ever done anything wrong? Well, of course they have, because they’re also human. Ada Just like everybody else, I thought the EU referendum was nothing to worry about. Just like with Trump at the time, I thought: it’ll be fine. People surely won’t vote for this. Rebecca I am very anti-Brexit. I still feel angry about the way things were manipulated by the leave campaign. I thought there were unpleasant aspects to it, racist aspects. At the end of the day, whatever I think, a vote is a vote, and there was a majority vote. You respect that. But I feel very sad. Ada I blame my Americanness for this, maybe, but I do not get the royal family. So they bring in a lot of money, but they cost a lot, too. There are so many other things to spend it on than keeping up this ridiculous institution. People who are in a position of power because they happen to be born into a family … I just don’t get it. Rebecca I’m a British republican, but I wouldn’t get up and march to get rid of the royal family. My view is that it’s connected to having a House of Lords – I’d rather have an elected upper chamber and no inherited rights. Ada Based on the few things that I’d seen and heard, I did have a really ignorant outlook on trans people.

4/7/2022,"Just months after Akshata Murty was born in April 1980, she was sent to live with her paternal grandparents after her parents moved hundreds of miles away to Mumbai for work. “Your mother and I were young then and struggling to find our feet in our careers,” her father wrote in a letter to Akshata, which was published in Legacy; Letters from eminent parents to their daughter. “Two months after your birth in Hubli [a city near Goa], we brought you to Mumbai, but discovered quickly enough that it was a difficult task to nurture a child and manage careers side by side. So, we decided that you would spend the initial years of your life with your grandparents in Hubli.” Her father, NR Narayana Murthy, a young computer programmer who would go on to launch IT services company Infosys and become a billionaire, said leaving Akshata behind was one of the hardest decisions he had had to make. “Every weekend, I would take the plane to Belgaum [a nearby airport] and then hire a car to Hubli. It was very expensive, but I couldn’t do without seeing you.” Her mother, Sudha Murty, a computer scientist and engineer, was the first female engineer to work for India’s then largest carmaker, part of the Tata conglomerate, and is now a philanthropist working to improve public healthcare. When Akshata did join her parents, and later her brother, Rohan, in Mumbai, life might not have been as relaxed as it was with her grandparents in Hubli. Sudha “decided early on that there would be no TV in our home so that there would be time for things like studying, reading, discussions, and meeting friends”, according to the book. Every evening, 8pm to 10pm was dedicated to “pursuits that brought the family together in a productive environment”. For Akshata and Rohan, that meant homework, while their parents “read books on history, literature, physics, mathematics, and engineering, or did any office work”. As the family became increasingly rich, Akshata’s parents eschewed hiring a private car and driver to take her school, preferring to stick with the “regular autorickshaw” where she made “great friends with the ‘rickshaw uncle’”. Murty went to the private liberal Claremont McKenna College in California, where she studied economics and French, before moving to the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles. She worked for Deloitte and Unilever before studying for an MBA at Stanford University. It was at Stanford that she met Rishi Sunak, who had won a prestigious Fulbright scholarship. Within four years, they were married in a two-day ceremony in Bengaluru, attended by cricketing royalty including the Indian spinner Anil Kumble and the family of Rahul Dravid, the former captain of the national cricket team. Her father said he was a “little sad and jealous” when Akshata first told him of her new life partner. “But when I met Rishi and found him to be all that you had described him to be – brilliant, handsome and, most importantly, honest – l understood why you let your heart be stolen.” After Stanford, she joined a Dutch clean technology incubator fund in San Francisco as marketing director in 2007, but left quickly to start her own fashion label, Akshata Designs. “I understand that there may be some curiosity around what I’m doing given my parents’ achievements, but I hope that one day this business is able to stand on its own feet and I’m able to speak on its merit rather than anything else,” she told the Times of India in 2009 when she founded the business. “This is my passion and I couldn’t imagine being engaged in anything else but the business of this venture.” The business, however, collapsed within three years. Money comes in from her 0.91% stake in Infosys, which is valued at about $900m (£690m), making Murty richer than the Queen (£365m). The couple also own London-based Catamaran Ventures UK, which invests in startups “with the view to future capital growth and income distributions”. Sunak transferred his shares to her just before entering parliament, and she is now the sole owner. She has direct shareholdings in at least six other UK companies, including gentlemen’s outfitters New & Lingwood, which measures Etonians for their tailcoats and sells silk dressing gowns for £2,500 each. Murty also holds shares in a UK business that operates Jamie Oliver’s Pizzeria, Jamie’s Italian and Wendy’s outlets in India, the nanny agency Koru Kids, and gym operator Digme Fitness, where she is a director. Both New & Lingwood and Digme furloughed staff during the pandemic. Soroco, a software company co-founded by her brother, lists Murty as a director of its UK arm. Murty and Sunak own at least four homes in the UK and California, including a five-bedroom mews house in Kensington, valued at almost £7m, and a £1.5m Georgian mansion set in 12 acres in Sunak’s North Yorkshire constituency, as well as a flat on the Old Brompton Road in west London. They also own a Santa Monica beach penthouse valued at £5.5m, which the property developer describes as having “stunning views of the Santa Monica mountains” and where you “wake up to the sound of waves crashing against the shore”.",News/Politics,Akshata Murty: who is Rishi Sunak’s wife?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/akshata-murty-who-is-rishi-sunak-wife
4/7/2022,"“Do I look moderate to you?” asks the never-knowingly subtle Florence Welch rhetorically on this James Ford-produced one-off single. Opening with bar-room piano stabs, it soon blossoms into a galloping rocker, Welch battling an inner voice suggesting she perhaps rein it in. Needless to say she doesn’t listen. Welch’s windswept wail and penchant for atmospheric harp flutters have made her catnip for fantastical film soundtracks. On this undulating, near seven-minute epic, taken from Tim Burton’s Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, Welch mourns relationships fractured by constant touring. “I wanted to go home, to be where you are,” she roars as drums crash like angry waves. On 2018’s fourth album High As Hope, Welch and her evolving studio cohorts (the more static ‘+ the Machine’ are for live shows) sought to dial down the bluster. On the experimental, relatively stripped back Big God – co-written by Jamie xx – Welch prowls around a loping piano figure, before a meandering sax solo from Kamasi Washington slowly takes over. After the ubiquitous success of debut album Lungs, Welch fast-tracked its follow-up Ceremonials, decamping to Abbey Road studios with producer Paul Epworth. While Lungs skipped around genres mischievously, the opulent Ceremonials focused more on widescreen chamber pop, with the Halo-esque Never Let Me Go a prime example of refined excess. High As Hope’s lead single feels like a soft caress in comparison to the usual cold, hard slap of a big chart-facing hit. Lyrically it ponders the paradox of performing live, exploring the huge highs that only temporarily pierce moments of strange isolation. “I thought I was flying but maybe I’m dying tonight,” Welch sings softly over distant harp flutters. While her early pop contemporaries Lily Allen and Adele turned relationships into soap operas and kitchen-sink dramas, Welch spun them into gothic fantasies. On Lungs’ propulsive fourth single, a new crush elicits the kind of high-wire emotions more akin to drowning, an exhausted Welch left “as empty as that beating drum”. Named after Frida Kahlo’s 1938 painting, Ceremonials’ more rock-leaning promotional single (AKA the one before the proper single), finds Welch returning to a lyrical trope; trying to understand the vastness of something too enormous to understand. Here she is overwhelmed by bodies of water, a place both beautiful and deadly. Created at the start of her 30s, High As Hope excels when Welch looks back at her youth with misty-eyed clarity. Over airy production, here she half-remembers nights spent holding hands with strangers “high on E”, and relishes in the false certainty of “it doesn’t get better than this”. Later, as the song starts to wrestle with itself, Welch snaps: “Oh God, what do I know?” Around the two-minute 45 seconds mark of this first single from next month’s Dance Fever, Welch unleashes an almighty, wordless roar, as if making it very clear that High As Hope’s sonic retreat was an anomaly. From there the song keeps building, like a raging fire fuelled by the opening verse’s slow burn anger at societal expectations placed on women. In 2012, Welch dipped her toe in EDM’s WKD-coloured waters not once but twice, with Calvin Harris first sending a remix of Ceremonials’ Spectrum to No 1. Three months later she was back with Harris at the top on this gloriously sugary confection, Welch sounding as if she’s having the time of her life while Harris unleashes a rapid-fire electronic blitzkrieg around her. Like most songs on Lungs, this single’s appeal has been dampened slightly by its ubiquity. There was a time in 2010 where you couldn’t shop, watch TV or wander around a festival field without hearing its opening harp trills, or that thumping chorus. Still, taken at a distance, it remains a glorious head-rush of emotions, Welch barely keeping up with its galloping ecstasy. A lot of second album Ceremonials teeters on the brink of self-parody, with everything turned up to 11. On the sky-scraping No Light, No Light, Welch revels in the OTT, swishing around cascading choirs and harps before ditching her highfalutin lyrical tropes in favour of direct emotion: “Would you leave me if I told you what I’d done?” she asks during the song’s majestic bridge. New album Dance Fever’s latest single finds Welch trying to find inspiration in a world locked down (“my arms emptied, the skies emptied” she panics in the song’s finale). What started as an acoustic “sad little poem” has been buffed by Glass Animals’ Dave Bayley into a pensive banger, all propulsive dance rhythms and tentative exaltation. By third album How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, Welch et al had reached festival headline status, a fact underlined months later at Glastonbury. On the album’s combative lead single, the pretty harp flourishes of old are swapped for rugged guitar riffs, with Welch utilising distinctly masculine rock tropes to admonish a useless man. In 2011, Florence + the Machine were big enough to be handed a coveted performance slot on The X Factor, a nod to Welch’s vocal influence on a plethora of “kooky” young hopefuls. They performed this maximalist baroque pop rager, which finds Welch trying to shake an almighty hangover by exorcising it from her body by sheer force alone. Another song created on a hangover, Lungs’ sixth single takes a classic subject – being really really in love – and straps it to a rocket aimed at the moon. There is not an ounce of subtly on display here (its firework-esque harp coda is joined by the sound of actual fireworks, for example), which only makes its youthful, cartwheeling exuberance all the more accurate. Across How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful’s 11 tracks, Welch invokes various characters, from Persephone to the Virgin Mary. On the delicate St Jude, which strips everything back to Welch’s pin-sharp voice and a distant electronic rumble, she references both the “patron saint of the lost causes” and the 2013 storm that shared her name. Somewhere in the middle sits perhaps her most genuinely affecting song. Written at the behest of her label, who asked Welch for something more upbeat to balance out Lungs’ darker fare, Rabbit Heart bristles with the fear that comes with reaching the point of no return. Aware she was about to dive into fame’s chasm, the song’s lyrics abound with sacrificial imagery (“Who is the lamb and who is the knife?”), all wrapped up in sprightly production that gave the band their first proper hit. Written initially as a private poem, High As Hope’s second single strips away any artifice and explores Welch’s relationship with drink and drugs (she’s been sober since 2014), and her teenage eating disorder. “At 17 I started to starve myself,” she sings, a bracing opening that’s soon warmed by the chorus’ light-footed melody and Welch’s sage reflections on the complex beauty of “vibrant youth”. While making How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, Welch has said producer Markus Dravs told her to stop writing songs about water. Thankfully, she ignored him, with the album’s lead single – a galloping mix of acoustic guitar, hammond organ and glockenspiel – likening a broken relationship to a battered ship being washed up on the shore. Throughout Welch conjures up images of great white sharks and killer whales to represent her demons, continuing her philosophy of never writing small songs about big emotions. By the glorious middle eight, Welch’s propensity for self-destruction has fully taken hold: “We are lost, and into the breach, we got tossed,” she sings, “And the water is coming in fast”. Ruin never sounded so wonderful.

4/7/2022,"It was 3am in the early hours of a Monday morning. I awoke to a phone call from my brother gasping for breath and struggling with chest pains in another room of my house. I rushed to his side and called an ambulance that took him to hospital. The next few hours were spent anxiously waiting to hear from doctors, who would eventually refer him to a specialised care unit. This was just one of several emergencies where, as his carer, I found myself navigating the complexities of his chronic conditions while watching the gradual demise of his health. Bleary eyed and sleep deprived, I left home later that morning and began the three-hour commute from my constituency in Bolton to my office in the House of Commons. For much of my time as an MP, I have been a carer. First, for my elderly mother, Sakina, who passed away in 2017, during the general election campaign, and more recently for my brother. I am just one of as many as 11.5 million carers in the UK who provide support to family members each day. Yet so many stories go untold, perhaps because sharing these struggles openly can be difficult. The reality is that half of us, by the age of 50, will find ourselves assuming responsibility for someone who cannot care for themselves. Most will not be able to afford outsourcing care to a nursing home or paid care workers – so they will be solely responsible for looking after their loved one. But despite unpaid carers providing an estimated £193bn of free labour a year, carer’s allowance remains the lowest paid benefit of its kind: a mere £67.60 a week for a minimum of 35 hours’ care. It is a scandal. Caring for someone you love is a privilege, but one that is fraught with the emotional and physical exhaustion of always being on call, alongside much personal sacrifice, anguish and sorrow. My parents had instilled in me a “no time for self-pity: just get on with it!” attitude to life. And I gave way to that kind of stoicism with my mother, when I had to reconcile that her several chronic conditions would probably never improve, and the time I had left with her was incredibly precious. I am lucky to have support from a local provider in the form of a social care plan. This provides a care worker to stand in for me when I’m away representing my constituents in Westminster, but with the social care system in crisis, many do not have this option – and they are being left to manage entirely without support by a government that is not only undermining but ignoring them. We urgently need a radical overhaul of social care and our attitudes towards unpaid care in Britain. I recently asked the health secretary about the number of unpaid carers, the help available to them and his plans for respite care. The minister was unable to answer any of my questions, although the government claimed that it is investing money in understanding the role unpaid carers play in our social care system. But we need to act much quicker and to properly support those who give so much, for so little in return. Carers UK reported in June 2021 that 72% of carers had not had a break since the pandemic began – and they were exhausted. For those caring for relatives who, like my brother, have a host of health issues that require regular hospital visits or prolonged hospital stays, it has meant two years in a near constant state of social isolation – owing to the frightful pressure of taking extra precautions to prevent the risk of infection. There are some organisations offering help, such as Carefree, which offers carers a night away at a partner hotel, free of charge, bar a small admin fee. This is a great initiative, but surely it is the government that should be providing a route to respite care. The NHS and the social care system would certainly have collapsed without unpaid carers, yet they receive so little public support or government praise – other than the cynical clap for carers during the pandemic. For too long, local authorities have had their social care budgets slashed, forcing services to be downgraded. The social care budget has long been looked upon as a cash cow, there to make huge savings without ever considering the human impact. Carers are now only really able to “pop in” for a flying visit, quickly making some tea and food, and having a brief chat, before they have to leave for their next appointment. This was all too clear in Ed Balls’ documentary Inside the Care Crisis. The government must look towards a home-first policy. This means providing support in people’s homes, allowing those who are elderly, clinically vulnerable or disabled the long-term dignity we all deserve. This is especially important in the case of patients who, like my brother, are on dialysis. Boris Johnson began his premiership by claiming he would provide a “plan to fix social care once and for all” – which we are yet to see. So long as the government continues to avoid this crucial issue, it is unpaid carers and those in need who will continue to suffer.

4/7/2022,"The BBC has been banned from identifying a “dangerous extremist and misogynist” who is allegedly an MI5 informant after a high court judge granted an injunction. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, successfully blocked the identification of the alleged informant, or covert human intelligence source (Chis), referred to as X throughout the proceedings. One woman told the BBC that X had used his status as an agent to abuse, control and coerce her and that MI5 must have known about his behaviour. Another said he might murder someone unless he were exposed. In a ruling on Thursday, Mr Justice Chamberlain said the evidence he had seen, both in open court and in closed hearings, had convinced him the injunction was necessary. “The attorney is more likely than not to succeed at trial in establishing that the balance of public and private interests favours the grant of relief prohibiting the BBC from disclosing X’s name and image,” he said. “The BBC will still be able to convey what it regards as the core elements of its story, including the allegation that X abused his Chis status and the allegation that MI5 is at fault for using or continuing to use him as a Chis. “The government will be heavily constrained in how it can respond to the latter allegation, but the constraints can be explained.” The BBC went to court earlier this month to try and stop an injunction against a report that would identify the MI5 agent. The corporation claimed the agent used his status to abuse two ex-partners – and said naming him was in the public interest. The government said identifying him risked his life and national security. Large parts of a two-day case took place in a closed hearing, which the BBC was not allowed to attend. The BBC claimed that X used his status as an agent to abuse, control and coerce a former partner, referred to by the pseudonym Beth, and that MI5 either knew or ought to have known about this and was wrong to use him as an agent. Another woman, known by the pseudonym Ruth, who alleges she was abused by him, has said she fears X will kill a woman if he is not “challenged and exposed”. Braverman sought an injunction to block the broadcast, arguing that identifying X would create a “real and immediate risk” of serious or life-threatening harm to him and would damage national security. Lawyers representing Braverman said that she “neither confirms nor denies” the BBC’s claim that X is an agent or covert human intelligence source (Chis), but is conducting the hearing on the “hypothetical assumption” that he is or was. The BBC’s legal team told the court: “Beth and Ruth have an intimate insight into X’s psyche and behaviour, making them uniquely placed to evaluate the risk that he poses to other women.” Lord Pannick, representing the broadcaster, said: “He told one of those women, who we call Beth, that he worked for MI5 in order to terrorise her, in order to control her. The programme will say that MI5 should have known about his behaviours and realised that it was not appropriate to [have] used him as a Chis.” He told the court there is a “particularly strong public interest” in the story given the “current context of public debate” on coercive control of women by male partners. There is “simply no cogent evidence to justify a conclusion that X is at serious risk of serious harm or death” if he is identified, Pannick said. In a witness statement, Beth said: “I think X is a very dangerous individual – to me, to ex-partners and to other women. He thinks it’s OK to treat women the way that he’s treated me. I believe he must be named and identified to the public at large to warn others.” Ruth said in a statement: “I consider that he is dangerous enough to kill a woman and I fear that he will do so if he is not challenged and exposed. I think it is crucial that other women know his identity and what he looks like, so that he cannot trick and harm them.” Sir James Eadie QC, for the attorney general, said: “Publication of the report would constitute a breach of confidence/false confidence by the BBC. “To do so would damage national security and the public interest. It would also create a real and immediate risk of serious or life-threatening harm to X.” The attorney general argued there was no objection to a broadcast about the allegations against X and MI5’s use of agents which did not identify him, but claimed that identifying him would be a breach of confidence and infringe X’s human rights. In a statement issued after the ruling, the BBC said the judgment did not prevent it from reporting “key elements” of its story once restrictions are determined, but said the use of “secret procedures” constrained what the judge was able to say about his decision. A spokesperson for the broadcaster said: “The BBC does not fully know the reasons why [identification of X presents a risk to national security] and nor will the public. This is due to the highly unusual fact that a significant proportion of the evidence in this case was heard in a closed hearing, which even the BBC as a party was not permitted to attend. “While we had ‘special advocates’ representing our interests in those closed proceedings, we are not able to know anything about the secret hearing. “The reasons the BBC is not able to identify X are largely in the closed judgment, which we cannot inspect. “The secret procedures used in cases like this also constrain what the judge is able to say about his decision in the public judgment. “They are a significant departure from the principles of open and natural justice, as the judge himself states.”",News/Media,BBC blocked from naming alleged MI5 informant accused of abusing women,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/07/bbc-blocked-from-naming-alleged-mi5-informant-accused-of-abusing-women
4/7/2022,"Scott Morrison is moving to head off an electoral backlash in South Australia after the prime minister appeared to water down the government’s commitment to building Aukus nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide. As he prepares to formally trigger the federal election campaign within days, Morrison was forced into damage control on Thursday, reassuring South Australian voters about his support for domestic shipbuilding jobs. The new South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, fired a warning shot, saying the Liberals had a track record of “delays and broken promises” and he would “not accept anything less” than the submarines being built in Adelaide. “My position is clear: the submarines must be built in Adelaide and South Australia must get the jobs we have been promised for years and years,” the Labor premier told Guardian Australia. South Australian federal Liberal MPs also said they expected the government to honour its commitment. The pre-election Aukus controversy stems from Morrison’s response on Wednesday when asked to guarantee that each of the new submarines – other than the nuclear reactor – would be built in Australia. Morrison gave a qualified answer. “Well, we’re working through all of those issues and that is certainly our intention to maximise all of that,” he told reporters in western Sydney. The prime minister went on to emphasise the need for speedy delivery. “But it’s also the paramount goal is to ensure we get that capability as soon as we can, and it’s in the best form that it can be working with our partners.” That was interpreted as a hint that a desire for shorter timeframes might trump local jobs when a decision is finalised early next year, and the issue was picked up by South Australian media outlets. In a sign of the Coalition’s political sensitivity over the issue, Morrison spoke to an Adelaide radio station on Thursday to insist his comments had been “twisted” in a “false and misleading” way. “I just want to put people’s minds at rest,” Morrison told radio FiveAA. “I mean, there’s no change to our policy here. We will build submarines in South Australia, and we will build as much of them in SA as we possibly can.” In the same interview, Morrison conceded there were “a lot of technical issues that we’ll have to work through” but said the desire to secure the capability as quickly as possible “doesn’t change our commitment to what we’re doing in South Australia, at all”. Pressed on whether he could quantify how much of the submarine would be built domestically, Morrison said: “Well, no one can. I mean, because we haven’t down-selected to the actual submarine.” When the Aukus partnership with the US and the UK was announced in September, the three countries launched an 18-month study into how Australia could achieve delivery of at least eight nuclear-propelled submarines. The Morrison government said at the time its intention was to build them in South Australia, although it never gave an iron-clad promise. It has yet to announce whether it prefers the US or the UK design, but has predicted the first submarines could be ready by the late 2030s. The South Australian independent senator Rex Patrick and rival upper house contender Nick Xenophon both vowed to campaign to secure local jobs. “I do not believe that the prime minister is being honest with the Australian public,” Patrick said. He cited the government’s dumping of its previous pledge to build the Pacific Step Up vessel domestically on the basis it needed to acquire it more quickly. Xenophon, who is attempting a political comeback, said Morrison was trying to use a “gaudy velvet wallpaper to plaster over a wall full of cracks and holes because there is no plan at the moment”. He said advanced manufacturing jobs were at stake. The Liberals were already concerned about the marginal lower house seat of Boothby, but the party is now also worried the seat of Sturt – formerly held by Christopher Pyne – could be vulnerable in the event of a backlash. The Liberal MP for Sturt, James Stevens, who has a 6.9% margin, said the government had “always been crystal clear that our future submarines will be built in Adelaide” and he expected the commitment to be kept. Rowan Ramsey, the Liberal MP for the safe seat of Gray, said South Australian members were “not always in lockstep with everything but we are lockstep on this one”. “The commitment is to build the subs in SA and that is what we expect to happen,” Ramsey said. The government also faces renewed scrutiny over the cost of the abandoned French diesel-electric submarine project. Defence officials told Senate estimates they expected the yet-to-be-completed settlement with French contractor Naval Group could be met from within the existing budget. About half of the $5.5bn in previously approved funding has already been spent. Morrison has defended the costs, saying Australia needed the less easily detectible nuclear-powered submarines: “The Plan B I had was better than Plan A.”",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison in damage control in South Australia over submarine comments,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/scott-morrison-in-damage-control-in-south-australia-over-submarine-comments
4/7/2022,"From Olga Tokarczuk’s epic about a man who claimed to be the messiah to Geetanjali Shree’s tale of a widow finding a new lease of life, female writers take the majority of places on this year’s International Booker prize shortlist. Of the six books now in contention for the prestigious translated fiction award, five were written by women, with three translated by women too. The International Booker goes to “the finest fiction from around the world” that has been translated into English, awarding a cash prize of £50,000, which is split equally between author and translator. After reading 135 books, the judges chose six titles from six different languages, all of which “explore the borders and boundaries of human experience”, according to chair of judges Frank Wynne. Cursed Bunny by Bora Chung, translated by Anton Hur (Honford Star) A New Name: Septology VI-VII by Jon Fosse, translated by Damion Searls (Fitzcarraldo)  Heaven by Mieko Kawakami, translated by Samuel Bett and David Boyd (Picador)   Elena Knows by Claudia Piñeiro, translated by Frances Riddle (Charco)  Tomb of Sand by Geetanjali Shree, translated by Daisy Rockwell (Tilted Axis) The Books of Jacob by Olga Tokarczuk, translated by Jennifer Croft (Fitzcarraldo)- “As a jury we have had the pleasure of reading many extraordinary books,” said Wynne. “Choosing a shortlist from among them has been difficult and sometimes heartbreaking.” The titles he selected alongside fellow judges Merve Emre, Petina Gappah, Viv Groskop and Jeremy Tiang “offer glimpses of literature from around the world,” he said. “But they all share a fierce and breathtaking originality that is a testament to the endless inventiveness of fiction.” Nobel laureate Tokarczuk and her translator Jennifer Croft previously won the prize in 2018 for Flights. They are now in with a chance of a second win for the 900-page The Books of Jacob, which Wynne compared to the Bayeux tapestry, such is its magnificence – “but probably about a mile and a half longer”. Meanwhile Tomb of Sand by Shree and her translator Daisy Rockwell is the first Hindi book to have made the shortlist in the prize’s 17-year history. The judges praised its “constantly shifting perspectives and timeframes”, calling it “loud and irresistible”. The Books of Jacob and Tomb of Sand are up against the “genre-defying” collection of short stories Cursed Bunny by Bora Chung, translated from Korean by Anton Hur and Heaven, a haunting tale of teenage violence, by Mieko Kawakami, translated from Japanese by Samuel Bett and David Boyd. The judges called Heaven “an intense, claustrophobic novel” which uses its story of school bullying to enact Nietzsche’s critique of morality. “The power of Sam Bett and David Boyd’s translation lies in its ability to communicate both Mieko Kawakami’s abstract, philosophical ideas and her harrowing human drama”, they said. Completing the lineup are Elena Knows, Claudia Piñeiro’s part-crime novel, part-morality tale, translated from Spanish by Frances Riddle, and A New Name: Septology VI-VII by Jon Fosse, translated from Norwegian by Damion Searls. The judges said the final instalment of Fosse’s Septology series “draws together art, death and the idea of God with a vast, gentle grace”. As usual, the shortlist is dominated by independent publishers. Tilted Axis and Honford Star, which publish Tomb of Sand and Cursed Bunny respectively, have had books nominated for the prize for the first time this year. This year also marks the first time a translator has chaired the judging panel. “Translation is an intimate, intricate dance that crosses borders, cultures and languages. There is little to compare to the awe and exhilaration of discovering a perfect pairing of writer and translator” said Wynne. Though he admitted that the judging process had at times been “harrowing”, he said that announcing the shortlist on the same day as his 60th birthday was “the best present I’ve had”. The winner of the 2022 prize will be announced on 26 May.",Arts/Books,International Booker prize shortlist delivers ‘awe and exhilaration’,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/07/international-booker-prize-shortlist
4/7/2022,"Scientists believe they have been given an extraordinary view of the last day of the dinosaurs after they discovered the fossil of an animal they believe died that day. The perfectly preserved leg, which even includes remnants of the animal’s skin, can be accurately dated to the time the asteroid that brought about the dinosaurs’ extinction struck Earth 66m years ago, experts say, because of the presence of debris from the impact, which rained down only in its immediate aftermath. “It’s absolutely bonkers,” said Phillip Manning, a professor of natural history at the University of Manchester. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the thescelosaurus leg discovered at the Tanis dig site in North Dakota was the “ultimate dinosaur drumstick”. He said: “The time resolution we can achieve at this site is beyond our wildest dreams … This really should not exist and it’s absolutely gobsmackingly beautiful. I never dreamt in all my career that I would get to look at something a) so time-constrained; and b) so beautiful, and also tells such a wonderful story.” The dig has been filmed for a BBC documentary Dinosaurs: The Final Day with Sir David Attenborough; during which the broadcaster will review the fossil finds. “When Sir David looked at ‘[the leg], he smiled and said ‘that is an impossible fossil’. And I agreed,” Manning said. He said the team had also discovered the remains of fish that had breathed in impact debris from the asteroid strike, which occurred 1,864 miles (3,000km) away in the Gulf of Mexico. That and the presence of other debris that rained down for a specific period immediately after the asteroid strike allowed them to date the site much more accurately than standard carbon dating techniques. Robert DePalma, the University of Manchester graduate student who is leading the Tanis dig, said: “We’ve got so many details with this site that tell us what happened moment by moment, it’s almost like watching it play out in the movies. You look at the rock column, you look at the fossils there, and it brings you back to that day.” The BBC reported that the team had also found the fossilised remains of a turtle that was skewered by a wooden stake and small mammals and their burrows, as well as skin from a triceratops, a pterosaur embryo inside its egg and what scientists think could be a fragment from the asteroid impactor itself.",News/Science,Scientists find fossil of dinosaur ‘killed on day of asteroid strike’,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/07/fossil-dinosaur-killed-asteroid-strike-thescelosaurus-north-dakota-extinction
4/7/2022,"By 11am on opening day at Portland’s The Sports Bra, billed as the world’s first sports bar showing only women’s sports, a bustling queue had already filled the sidewalk. While members of the Pride Cheerleading Association shook pompoms in the parking lot, dozens of women – fans and athletes alike – waited to grab a seat and reach a milestone together. “I actually got emotional and cried when I walked in,” said Leslie Melin, who sat at the bar with a signature cocktail. “I’m so proud to be here.” The Sports Bra, which opened its doors in Oregon on 1 April, seeks to address a glaring gender imbalance in sports coverage. Although 40% of professional athletes are female, women’s sports make up only 4% of all sports media coverage, according to a Unesco study on gender equality. “Our approach is to take that 4% that is showing and put it on blast,” said Jenny Nguyen, the bar’s founder and owner. That message resonated with those who showed up for the kick-off. Jamie Orr – one of hundreds of backers who raised more than $100,000 on The Sports Bra’s Kickstarter campaign – made history by becoming its first customer. “To have a sports bar where you’re not going to have to fight to get the back TV turned on to a women’s game, it’s just great,” she said. “Hardly anyone knows the history of women’s football,” said Leah Hinkle, general manager of the Oregon Ravens, a team of the Women’s National Football Conference, whose games will be streamed at The Sports Bra. “But equity isn’t just about divvying up screen time,” added Hinkle. “Equity is about having what you need to succeed. Women’s sports need a movement and The Sports Bra is making a statement.” The statement starts with five television screens, mounted on walls adorned with framed jerseys and memorabilia from a swath of women’s teams. The bar has partnered with ESPN3 and media company Just Women’s Sports to stream a variety of programming, from games to original content. And during times when there are no women’s sports to broadcast or stream, the bar plans to turn the TVs off, to highlight the lack of coverage. “We use that weakness as a talking point to draw attention to it,” Nguyen said. “I would love to play 24-7 women’s sports in here, but it’s just not possible.” Opening weekend offered a host of matches, from pro golf to college softball. The bar also showed two games of the NCAA’s March Madness, the first since Sedona Prince’s viral TikTok video highlighted shocking inequality between men’s and women’s weights rooms, leading to an equity review and a host of changes at the college basketball tournament. For Sivan Nadler, head of strategy at Just Women’s Sports, Nguyen’s concept gets to the heart of the matter. “There is a lot of language and marketing linked to empowerment and social good around women’s sports,” said Nadler. “And both of those things are important, but there’s not enough about the fact that these women are ballers. We want to see them play.” The seeds of The Sports Bra were planted four years ago when Nguyen and some friends watched a killer NCAA women’s championship at a local bar, on mute. Afterwards, Nguyen made an off-the-cuff remark: “You know, the only time we’re ever going to be able to watch a women’s game, with the sound on and all the fanfare, is if we had our own space.” A few days later she came up with the name and a cheeky slogan followed: We support women. Yet for years, The Sports Bra would remain a running joke among Nguyen and her friends. Whenever they found themselves frustrated by the lack of representation of women’s sports, they’d return to the safe space in their imagination and curate a playlist of games and even menu ideas. Eventually, as Nguyen faced a period of personal frustration marked by the Covid-19 pandemic and George Floyd’s murder, her girlfriend suggested she turn her dream of The Sports Bra into a reality. It was a risk, as droves of bars and restaurants were shuttered during lockdown, while new businesses were competing to snatch up hot real estate from the ashes. Rejected by the banks, Nguyen persevered with Kickstarter pledges and seed funding from friends and family. Food is an important part of the bar’s identity, and Nguyen’s too. It saved her life, so to speak, when her athletic career ended abruptly after she ruptured her ACL playing college basketball. Devastated, she turned to cooking and for the next 15 years worked her way up through Portland’s renowned culinary scene. The Sports Bra menu contains traditional pub grub with vegan-friendly options that uplift Nguyen’s Vietnamese heritage, including her mother’s famous clay-pot pork ribs and her aunt’s glazed chicken wings. Its message carries over to its vendors, sourcing beef, beverages and produce from women-owned companies in the community. Even its cocktails give a wink to women’s sports, including a gin drink called “Triple Axel” – a salute to Portland’s own Tonya Harding. Fixing the gender problem in sports coverage is bigger than simply opening a bar, but Nguyen hopes their mission can make a dent, one game at a time. Experts say building visibility is a key part of increasing young women’s participation in sports. According to the Women’s Sports Foundation, by the time a girl reaches 14 years of age, she’s twice as likely to drop out of sports compared to a boy. And if she’s LGBTQ+ or a person of color, the dropout rates double. It’s one reason why The Sports Bra is allowing minors into the space. Ngyen hopes that in the coming years, there might even be potential to franchise and expand. “I think that by giving women’s sports fans a physical location to celebrate, we can show the general public and mainstream media that there’s huge potential for growth and investment in women’s sports.”",News/US news,"Cheers, drinks and tears: opening day at the bar where women’s sports reign",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/sports-bra-portland-oregon-womens-sports-bar

4/7/2022,"In October 2020, Laura Zuniga got a call from a dispatcher at Eagle Trucklines. She would be picking up a load in Fresno, California, that morning and dropping it off in Florida that evening. She had never driven with the male colleague assigned to co-drive with her before, but said yes because she had recently graduated from training and needed the experience as well as the money. Zuniga drove first so the other driver could rest in one of the two beds in the back of the cab. But once they were on the road he kept coming to the front in his underwear. He asked her if she liked sex. Then he told her he wanted to pay her for sex. When she told him she wasn’t a sex worker, he claimed he was joking and returned to the back. When Zuniga eventually pulled over to take a nap, her co-driver repeatedly put his arm over her and got under her blanket. “Then I just remember him on top of me and trying to push me down,” she said. Her usual lightning-fast cadence slows and she chokes out the words, describing how she fought him as he pulled her pants down. He was naked. “His hands were everywhere,” she said. “I remember saying no, don’t, stop. And he doesn’t care, he’s smiling.” She called her dispatcher in tears, only to be told that she shouldn’t call the police, to just keep driving, so she did. But when her co-driver kept coming to the front and patting her on the head, Zuniga pulled over and called 911. “I just wanted to come home,” she said. Female truckers make up only 7% of the workforce, and in a recent study more that 90% reported experiencing at least one incident of sexual harassment in their careers. This, in addition to physically grueling conditions and falling pay, makes a profession that is hard for male truckers nearly impossible for women. As the world’s supply chain remains snarled, with shelves going bare and prices increasing, a lack of truck drivers comes into sharp focus. The American Trucking Association says that the industry is short 80,000 drivers, a number it warns could double within 10 years – a big problem for an industry that moves 72% of the country’s freight. Trucking used to be a solid middle class job, but when the industry was deregulated in the 1980s, the conditions cratered and compensation has gone down by 40%. Drivers often aren’t paid for the time they wait for goods to be loaded or unloaded, which can take hours, and are frequently classified as independent contractors and denied benefits and protections that regular employees enjoy. The largest companies have turnover rates of more than 90%, meaning that nearly everyone who starts out driving will leave within a year. If the trucking industry wants to close its driver shortfall, it can’t shut out half of the workforce. But that requires ending an epidemic of sexual abuse that spreads unchecked throughout the trucking industry, and that companies prioritize humane working conditions over ever-faster delivery times. When Zuniga told the dispatcher she had called the police, he was angry and worried about the load getting to its destination. By the time police arrived and filled out a report, her co-driver had fled on foot. Zuniga drove the truck to Arizona alone, dropped off the load, and drove back home to Fresno. After the incident, Eagle stopped calling her to work. The company didn’t pay her for the drive to Arizona. Her assailant, meanwhile, kept driving for Eagle for months afterward. Zuniga’s story is recounted in a lawsuit that she’s filed naming the company and the other trucker, alleging sexual and racial harassment and discrimination as well as sexual battery, wrongful termination, and a failure to pay her what she was owed. Eagle Trucklines has denied the allegations in the lawsuit, but has not responded to the Guardian’s request for comment. To date, Zuniga’s lawyer has been unable to find the other trucker and serve him with papers. “The way the company treated me, I felt worthless,” Zuniga said. Many of the factors that make sexual harassment more likely in any workplace proliferate in trucking. Sexual harassment is more common in heavily male-dominated workplaces, deployed as a way to show the few women that they aren’t welcome. Getting into trucking requires training, almost always from another driver, which creates a power imbalance because that person is a trainee’s ticket to graduation and certification. Most trucking companies hire entry-level workers to co-drive so that they can move products faster by trading off driving and sleeping. Out on the road, trainers decide when stops get made for showers or bathroom breaks. New drivers have to accumulate experience and money before they can own their own trucks, putting them once again at a disadvantage with the more experienced co-driver. Truckers are isolated on the road with their trainers and co-drivers, and they share a small space, including to sleep. Women may also be afraid to speak out about abuse and call attention to themselves and may not be taken seriously by the men they report to. Desiree Ann Wood is a truck driver and president of Real Women in Trucking. “The companies just basically push it under the rug,” she said, referring to sexual harassment. “They make the woman feel like she did something wrong.” Wood said many companies required a witness to an incident before they would investigate, which is next to impossible in trucking. It becomes a self-perpetuating cycle: with so few women in the industry they are frequently targeted for abuse, forcing them out of jobs that pay more than female-dominated service sector work. Other women who might consider entering may stay away, knowing the danger they could face. Zuniga, 39, had worked at a laundromat since 2016 and loved her job, but the pay was $11 an hour and she struggled to provide for her three daughters, ages 14, 12, and 10, often turning to public assistance programs and carrying credit card debt. “If I don’t have the money I feel like a horrible parent,” she said. She has long yearned to buy a house where her daughters can have their own rooms and a yard. She spotted an opportunity when she saw men pull into the shopping center where the laundromat is located in nice cars talking about buying houses. She found out they earned their money in trucking. When her co-worker Eunice went to trucking school in early 2019, Zuniga decided she should do the same, though she knew nothing about trucks. She started from scratch, memorizing the steps it takes just to start the engine. The learning curve was made harder by the reception from men who were the majority of trainers and fellow students. The trainers refused to give her a turn in the truck; it wasn’t until one offered to let her do it after hours that she was able to learn. It took her about six months to get the experience she needed to pass the test to graduate in October 2019. Then she started looking for a job. When Eunice started working with Eagle Trucklines and showed Zuniga her big paycheck, she signed up there, too. “I was thinking about the money,” she said. “I just wanted to work.” One week of driving a truck can net Zuniga $1,800-$1,900, which, despite her assault, makes it hard for her to leave the industry. “Every time I get in the truck I’m confident, I feel happy,” she said. “It feels good to work and have money.” But going on a long hauls means leaving her daughters with her elderly mother. “Every time I leave I feel like I don’t deserve my daughters,” she said. Her youngest always cries; her oldest tells her not to leave. She has missed birthdays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. “I feel like a horrible mother,” she said, “missing out on everything.” Since being assaulted, Zuniga is wary of trucking companies trying to take advantage of her in any way. She has left six jobs due to feeling cheated by her employers. She says they’ve undercounted the miles she’s driven, tried to make her drive on her days off, and pushed her to drive longer hours than the rules permit. She gets docked for being late even if it’s because of traffic or she needed to fuel up. She pees in a cup in the truck to save time. She left her most recent job after the company didn’t pay her on time. “I had I think $100 in my bank account,” she said. All the while, Zuniga is still dealing with the trauma of the assault. “My mind’s been messed up. I haven’t been the same,” she said. “I wish I had a button in my head I could just delete that.” She has lost hair and gained weight. She has nightmares, and her therapist has diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder. She feels like a puzzle missing a piece, “and I want my piece back.” She takes new precautions on the road now, carrying pepper spray, and drawing a hood up over her head and a mask to “feel safe”. If she could afford karate or boxing classes, she’d go, to “learn to kick them,” she said. “I’m always a happy person. I like to laugh, I like to talk,” she said. But after the assault, she lost her confidence. “I felt like he had taken something away from me.” Zuniga’s experience is, sadly, common. Sexual assault frequently leads to PTSD and other psychological effects, such as harms to self-esteem and what psychologists call safety schemas. “It damages the way you feel about the world and about yourself in the world,” said Louise Fitzgerald, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Illinois, who has worked on sexual harassment cases against truck companies. It disrupts victims’ sense of trust, both in other people and in themselves. “They feel that they’ve lost some part of themselves, that they’ll never be the person that they used to be,” she said. It can also have employment repercussions. “One of the outcomes of trauma is that you try to avoid everything that’s associated with the trauma,” Fitzgerald said. That can make it nearly impossible to want to get back in, say, the truck of a cab after being assaulted there. There are ways to mitigate sexual harassment and assault in trucking if companies are serious about eradicating it. Professionalizing the whole process would go a long way. Training programs, Wood argues, should fall under the purview of the Education Department and be subject to Title IX gender discrimination protections. On long trips with trainers or co-drivers, drivers should sleep in motels, and companies can create more routes that get drivers home faster. Workers need to know their rights and how to report violations of them. They need a safe and secure way to report incidents quickly after they happen – maybe panic buttons, or through regular, automatic check ins – and to trust that the companies will take them seriously and act without retaliating. “Those seem like simple things, but they can be really transformative,” said Jennifer Mondino, director of the TIME’S UP Legal Defense Fund, which offers low-income workers legal and media support in sexual harassment cases and has aided Zuniga’s case. Wood argues that people who harass or abuse their trainees or co-drivers should have their CDL licenses revoked or be banned from training or co-driving. She has also called for companies that are sued over sexual harassment and assault to be put on probation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and removed from the Department of Labor’s apprenticeship programs. In mid-March, Zuniga was hoping to get a new job driving trucks for a different company. “I just want to keep going forward,” she said. There are many days when she just wants to give up. But she knows she has to keep trying. “Because my daughters are watching.”  Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

4/7/2022,"Big cities in California spent large portions of their federal Covid relief money on police departments, a review of public records has revealed, with several cities prioritizing police funding by a wide margin. As part of the American Rescue Plan Act (Arpa), the Biden administration’s signature stimulus package, the US government sent funds to cities to help them fight coronavirus and support local recovery efforts. The money, officials said, could be used to fund a range of services, including public health and housing initiatives, healthcare workers’ salaries, infrastructure investments and aid for small businesses. But most large California cities spent millions of Arpa dollars on law enforcement. Some also gave police money from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (Cares) Act, adopted in 2020 under Donald Trump. The records show: San Francisco received $312m in Arpa funds for fiscal year 2020 and allocated 49% ($153m) to police, 13% ($41m) to the sheriff’s department, and the remainder to the fire department, according to the city controller. San Francisco also gave roughly 22% ($38.5m) of its Cares funds to law enforcement. Los Angeles spent roughly 50% of its first round of Arpa relief funds on the LAPD, according to a public records request by the controller candidate Kenneth Mejia, and first reported in local news site LA Taco. Fresno spent $36.6m of its Cares funds on the police, making up 67% of Cares spending on city salaries, and roughly 40% of all of Fresno’s Cares funds. San Jose allocated roughly $27.8m of its Cares and Arpa funds to police salaries and the police dispatch department, representing about 12% of its relief money. Long Beach allocated the majority of its $135.8 million Arpa funds to police, though a spokesperson said a detailed breakdown of funds was not available. Oakland allocated $5m (13.5%) of its Cares funds to police salaries; Sacramento allocated $2.2m (2.5%) of Cares funds to police; and San Diego spent roughly $60.1m (64%) of its Cares funds on police in fiscal year 2020, and $52.6m (33%) in fiscal year 2021. The budgeting and reporting process varies by city and is often opaque, making it difficult to compare and analyze how governments prioritized police and executed their budgets. In Fresno, the city allocated more than double of its Cares money to police than it did to Covid testing, contact tracing, small business grants, childcare vouchers, transitional housing and small business grants combined. Oakland’s police allocation was greater than the amounts spent on a housing initiative, a small business grant program and a workforce initiative. San Jose, meanwhile, spent significantly more on housing services and food programs than on law enforcement. And although Long Beach initially reported that it was allocating 100% of its Arpa funds to police, a spokesperson said $11.8m of those funds were now going to direct relief grants and that a portion was also supporting the city’s parks and marine departments. Officials from Oakland and Anaheim both said that their Arpa awards were used as “revenue replacement” for their general fund, and said it was not possible to specify where the federal money went (though both cities typically spend large portions of their overall budgets on police, with Oakland going $22m over budget last year). A Bakersfield representative said $13.6m in Cares funds went to public safety, but did not specify how much of that went to police. Cities have explained their spending on police in a number of ways. In a report for the US government, Long Beach said police were “heavily involved in the City’s Covid-19 response”, including opening an emergency operations center and providing security at testing and vaccination sites. Stephen Walsh, Oakland’s controller, said that claiming Cares funds for the police was an “accounting strategy” and that the relief money wasn’t used to expand law enforcement, but rather to avoid cuts. He said this allowed the city to “pursue a great variety of worthy projects directed at Covid relief”. A spokesperson for the LA controller also said the Arpa funds were used for LAPD revenue that had previously been budgeted, and a representative for the LA city administrative officer said allocations for “public safety services” were “consistent with the intent of the funds”. Hillary Ronen, a member of the board of supervisors in San Francisco, noted that there were minimum staffing needs for the fire department and police, and that Covid cases in those departments forced cities to spend large amounts on public safety overtime. But she also said she appreciated the criticisms of the law enforcement allocations and that she wanted to see San Francisco invest in alternatives to police: “Over time, I do hope to shrink the budget of the police department.” Cities using relief funds for police have typically funneled the money to salaries, although The Appeal recently reported that some jurisdictions were using stimulus dollars to buy new surveillance technology and build new prisons. The data in California matches national trends. After the George Floyd uprisings sparked a national debate about the role of law enforcement and calls for the US to “defund the police” and reinvest those dollars in services, local governments across the US used Covid relief to maintain and expand law enforcement, including Chicago, Philadelphia and the state of Alabama. Meanwhile, the pressure to invest more in police is growing amid a rise in homicides and other crimes, even as the crime rate remains significantly lower than previous decades. The significant stimulus spending on police reflects the longstanding budget priorities in the US, where police spending has tripled over the last 40 years, with cities spending an increasing portion of their general funds on officers. Arpa allowed cities to replace lost revenue, so many of them funneled the relief to the agencies that previously received the most money. But in California, a state with severe income inequality and a dramatically worsening homelessness crisis, the stimulus spending has sparked backlash from community organizers who argue that the funds should have gone directly to civilians and that police should have accepted cuts. “It was called the ‘American Rescue Plan’, but you’re telling me that what needed to be rescued was the police department?” said Stephen “Cue” Jn-Marie, a pastor and activist at Skid Row in LA. “The city’s kneejerk reaction is always to use law enforcement to respond to everything … and the police forces keep getting larger.” “When the money is going toward law enforcement again, it’s just increasingly criminalizing those that need the most help,” said Hope Williams, an activist in San Francisco, referencing the escalating police crackdown on unhoused people suffering from addiction in the city. Williams, who has sued the police department over its treatment of protesters, added, “It’s exhausting and infuriating, but not surprising.” James Burch, policy director at the Anti Police-Terror Project, a coalition that organizes against police violence in Oakland, said it was frustrating how hard it was to get basic information on stimulus spending: “Cities like Oakland do everything they can to hide how much money they spend on policing, because if the public truly knew how much we spend on police and how little we spend on services, they would be infuriated.” In LA, the Arpa spending plan was not publicized until Kenneth Mejia, an accountant and advocate running for controller, filed a public records request with the current controller. Some other cities’ public reports have not directly mentioned police at all, categorizing the expenditures under “government services” or “payroll”. “It’s shocking and not at all transparent,” said Mejia, who has also uncovered how cannabis business taxes go to police. He further noted that LAPD was getting the funding at a time in 2021 when many of the department’s employees were declining to get vaccinated, with officers routinely caught on camera refusing to wear masks. “A city’s spending is representative of a city’s values … and you think that Covid relief money is going to help people, but it’s not. It’s going to police.”",News/US news,California cities spent huge share of federal Covid relief funds on police,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/covid-relief-funds-california-cities-police
4/7/2022,"Sea levels have risen about 9in since 1880, with one-third of that gain from the last 25 years alone. Every year, a flurry of reports are published warning of the risk to towns and cities along coastal areas. It’s one thing to hear about a looming disaster; it’s another to see the cataclysm play out in real time. That’s what’s happening in Taholah, a village on Washington’s coast that acts as the capital for the Quinault Indian Nation, a tribe of around 3,600 members. In Taholah, climate change-caused sea level rise has brought to the community a fast receding shoreline, and with it a heightened threat of flooding: according to Quinault estimates, the ocean level could increase by 2.6ft by 2100, pushing storm surges higher and bringing waves closer to town. On an overcast February morning, Larry Ralston, the 62-year-old treasurer of the Quinault Nation, drove his silver Ford SUV down a network of Taholah’s unmarked gravel roads, telling me about what this place used to look like, before climate change permanently reconfigured the landscape. Parked on a rock face overlooking the Pacific, he nodded toward a moss-covered boulder towering out of the water. As a kid in the ‘60s, Ralston said, he was able to trek by foot to the rock. And now? He reckons the water is 30ft deep. Back then the ocean didn’t seem like a menace – at least not an existential one. That’s no longer the case: some 660 Taholah residents who border the ocean now find themselves living in an increasingly dangerous flood zone. The only solution is for everyone – and everything – in the village to move uphill. “We can see firsthand what’s happening,” Ralston told me. “There’s no denying it.” Taholah signals what’s to come for coastal communities across the country. Already, about 15 million American homes are at risk of flooding, and the threat is only going to get worse. A report released in February by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) projected that sea level along the US coastline would rise by 10 to 12in, on average, in the next 30 years – an uptick that would make damaging flooding occur 10 times more often than it does today. “It’s important to understand in these communities that sea level rise is happening now,” said William Sweet, an oceanographer with NOAA’s National Ocean Service and the country’s top scientist studying sea level rise. “Its impacts are happening now, and those impacts will grow worse in the next 30 years. Minor-nuisance flooding will be replaced by flooding that’s more damaging to economies and to infrastructure.” That future could very well touch off a mass migration of people away from coastline and flood zones. Research published in 2020 in the journal PLOS One estimated that sea level rise could cause over 13 million Americans to relocate inland by 2100 – an outcome with huge economic, social, and political consequences. Yet, even with the deluge of warnings, there is no centralized lifeline available to coastal communities. There are a number of federal programs designed to give assistance to such areas through government bodies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but those pots of money are far from adequate to tackle a problem of this scale. Some local governments have chosen to offer – and in a few cases mandate – buyouts to homeowners in vulnerable areas, who wind up dispersing. Others would prefer to keep the neighborhood intact – in Taholah’s case, by moving the whole village. In 2017, the Quinault Tribal Council adopted the Taholah Village Relocation Master Plan, which would move the lower enclave of the village about a half-mile uphill by 2030, where a new 200-acre development would offer flood-free land for over 300 housing units, a police station, a courthouse, a K-12 school and a museum, among other buildings. The initiative makes the Quinault among the first in the US – alongside communities in Louisiana and Alaska, among others – to voluntarily opt for a strategy of managed retreat away from impending climate threats. To date, the council has been able to build a new administrative complex, a so-called generations building to house Head Start and senior programs, and approximately 150 homes – construction that is owed to a combination of US Department of Agriculture grants, HUD money, and the tribe’s own funds. To pay for the rest, Ralston estimates they’ll need an additional $200m – a daunting sum, especially considering the bipartisan infrastructure bill that was signed into law by President Biden last year provided just $130m to support relocation efforts for the 574 federally recognized tribes across the US. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, there are roughly 5.7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives in the US, many of whom are on the frontlines of climate change. A multi-year study published last year in the journal Science found that Indigenous nations in the US not only lost 99% of their historical land, but what relatively little they were eventually allotted are often more exposed to climate change hazards than their historical lands. The Quinault Nation settled permanently on their 189,621-acre reservation – much of it conifer forest and unsuitable to farming – in the 19th century, after a long and at times contentious negotiation with the Washington government and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Though the allotted land was still a far cry from what was lost, the ocean provided a natural icebox for sockeye salmon (known as “blueback” among the Quinault peoples), a unique fish that is central to the Quinault identity, and is under threat due in part to ocean acidification and warmer waters. “There’s a parity between the Quinault people and the blueback,” Ralston said as his SUV ambled past a large illustrated cutout of the salmon affixed to a lamppost. “We try to save our blueback, so we can save ourselves.” Two weeks later and 2,400-some miles away from Taholah, I was in the Allen Field subdivision of Houston, Texas, talking with Dolores Mendoza, a 35-year-old mother of three. She is trying to figure out how to convince people in the neighborhood – many of whom are relatives – that the county’s effort to remove them from their homes shouldn’t be ignored. Taholah and Harris county are a study in contrasts: the former, a cash-strapped program that, if successful, would keep a neighborhood intact; and the latter a messy but better funded effort that will ultimately move people out of high risk zones but tear a community apart. I met Mendoza, who works as a credit controller at an inspection agency, on a chilly afternoon at her former home, a three-bedroom house that’s just a stone’s throw from the Greens Bayou watershed. Harris county bought the place in December, paying Mendoza a total of $300,000 for the property ($70,000 for the house and $230,000 to relocate). The sale was a coup for her, given that she paid $62,000 to buy the 1,200sq ft house in 2010. She’s since moved to Kingwood, a wealthier neighborhood about 15 miles away. That’s not to say Mendoza was keen on leaving. She grew up in Allen Field, and, by her count, still has family living in 13 different nearby houses. “I wanted this community,” she said. “It’s not pretty to look at, but my family’s here.” It’s only a matter of time before that’s no longer the case. As we walked through the beige-colored house, which had been ransacked and vandalized in the two months since its sale, Mendoza recalled how the place used to look when she and her three kids lived there. “This was mine,” she said, gesturing toward a room that was empty except for the shards of glass littered on the floor. “I had my bed here. My makeup vanity here. My TV over here.” Harris county is a sprawling region of 4.7 million people, about half of whom live in Houston. Much like Taholah, it is caught in climate change’s crosshairs. Hurricanes are becoming more common in the area, bringing with them enough rainwater to flood the state’s bayou systems. Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston in 2017 and took the lives of at least 88 in Texas, was the third “500-year flood” within the last three years. Worse yet, the Texas coast has sunk about 2ft within the last century, due in part to excessive groundwater pumping, making the state more vulnerable to flooding. But Harris county also bears a different distinction: It is the national leader in federally funded home buyouts, responsible for some 2,500 acquisitions, on top of 1,000 homes purchased by the Harris County Flood Control District with local funds. Since the 1980s, Fema has supported over 43,000 property buyouts in the US. That is well short of the 3.63 million people in the country who are likely to encounter flooding every year. Until the last few years, buyouts in Harris county were all voluntary and favored affluent and white recipients, mirroring a national trend. In 2020, still reeling from Hurricane Harvey, the county secured funding through Fema and state agencies to introduce a new mandatory buyout program for around 400 mostly residential properties spread throughout eight areas. It’s estimated the mandatory program will affect about 2,000 people, about 13% of the local populace. In Allen Field, many of the homes that fall under the mandatory buyout guidelines are on Darjean Street, where Mendoza’s family still lives. Eligible homeowners in Allen Field – 86% of whom are nonwhite, according to census data – say the buyout process has been confusing and inefficient. Some residents were baffled when they first received a legalese-laden mailer explaining that they would have to sell their home to the government. Many in the area aren’t fluent in English, making the flyers even more confusing. “There’s a lot of red tape that makes it very difficult for families to figure out how to navigate the process,” said Shirley Ronquillo, a local community activist who has helped residents navigate buyout programs. Nor is it clear to many what their lives will look like when they move to a new neighborhood, which could be many miles away. According to a 2019 study published in the journal Social Problems, buyouts cause more significant erosion to the social fabric of communities with lower-value homes and Black and brown residents, in large part because they’re forced to move farther away to find affordable housing. (The community services department spokesperson said the program assigns to anyone in the buyout program a relocation specialist to “provide referrals to community resources and organizations to provide further assistance to residents.”) There’s also an issue of protraction. “It still takes Harris county over two years to close on the average property,” said Rob Moore, a senior policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. Some people, tired of waiting for the government, sell their homes to exploitative speculators, often for far less than they’d make in a buyout program. While Taholah is a better organized effort, it’s also, paradoxically, a less wellfunded one. “Unfortunately, the limited federal resources available are even less accessible to tribal communities,” said Washington representative Derek Kilmer, who worked to secure $500,000 for the Quinaults’ relocation efforts in the fiscal year 2022. Kilmer also sponsored the Tribal Coastal Resiliency Act, which would provide further support to Indigenous communities on coastal issues. Any additional funding would likely come through the Housing, Commerce, or Interior Departments, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency – all of which are in the process of creating or revamping relocation programs. But getting money to a community as small as Taholah, where the median household income is about $32,000, can be a challenge. “Fema repeatedly told us that these competitive funds are based on numbers, not on need,” said Ralston, the Quinault treasurer. “Hurricane Katrina affected a quarter million people. Hurricane Taholah only affects 850 people. So, where are you going to put your money?” The Quinault Nation applied for two additional grants through Fema in 2020, totaling about $126,000,000. A Fema spokesperson wrote in an email that both applications were selected for review. “We anticipate the planning grant to be awarded soon.” Taholah’s lower village features rows of houses – many of them modest and worn – alongside a gym, a seafood wholesaler, a community center, a gas station-cum-deli, and a few other businesses. Many homes have boats scattered unceremoniously on their yards. There’s a 10-ft seawall separating the town from the Pacific, though it’s been breached repeatedly in the last few years, despite repeated improvements by the Army Corps of Engineers. “We used to get flooding in the lower village every three to five years,” Ralston said. Now it’s every year.” Ralston told me about his plans to commemorate the place they’ll leave behind. He imagines a park, well-maintained and accessible to the public, with fruit trees and picnic benches. “Just to memorialize the families that used to live here” he said before letting out a quiet sigh. “Obviously that may not happen for a while. It’s just a vision.” In Allen Field, Mendoza says that the memory of Harvey – and the lack of government support in the wake of the hurricane – left a bad taste. Harvey hit low-income and non-white areas like Mendoza’s hardest, thanks to crumbling infrastructure and insufficient flood control measures. Ronquillo, the community activist, offered a more scathing critique: “You have a government entity coming in and saying, ‘you have to leave.’ Why are they being asked to leave? Because there was years of negligence, lack of support in our communities of color,” she said. “Harvey was terrifying,” Mendoza said. “I was here by myself with my kids. I didn’t even know how we were going to get out.” Help never came from the government; it was her brother-in-law, riding in on a hotwired boat, who rescued Mendoza and her children. Mendoza waited for a year and half until the county could make good on its offer. She said she was told by the county not to spend money on repairs since she was going to be offloading the asset anyway. “They don’t want us to repair our houses, so we have leaking roofs, broken pipes, electrical problems.” (The community services department spokesperson said the county “encourages the homeowner to make repairs in the cases where by not making the repair a person’s health and safety are endangered.”) After leaving her house, Mendoza and I walked for a few minutes along the banks of Greens Bayou, where she reflected on her new life. The new house is great, she says. As is the kids’ school. But she still feels like a stranger. “I’ve seen my grandma twice since I moved,” she said. “Usually I’d see her every day, checking the mail when I’d go pick up the kids for school. Now we don’t have that community. I don’t know my neighbors.” At that moment a pair of adolescent boys ran by us, each one gripping a large ice cream shake. Mendoza knows the boys well; they’re close with her family. “It’s cold,” she said to them with a laugh. “Y’all should have your jackets on.”",News/Environment,‘It’s happening now’: how rising sea levels are causing a US migration crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/07/its-happening-now-how-rising-sea-levels-are-causing-a-us-migration-crisis
4/7/2022,"Manchester United’s proposed fan share scheme is at a critical juncture with no guarantee it will go ahead. The United co-chairman Joel Glazer announced the move last May after supporter protests – a group of about 100 broke into Old Trafford causing the Premier Leaguer fixture with Liverpool to be postponed – about the Glazer family’s ownership of the club. The protests were ignited by United’s decision to join the short-lived European Super League in April. Glazer hoped the prospect of fans owning shares in the club would be in place for the start of this season but as the first anniversary of the Super League’s collapse approaches, it remains, at best, a work in progress. “We have worked hard since last summer to design a fans’ share scheme which would open a path for fans to build a meaningful ownership stake in the club,” a United spokesperson said. “Significant progress has been made, but this is a complex project and we are continuing to work towards a robust and attractive proposal for fans.” United are in negotiations with the Manchester United Supporters’ Trust regarding a further round of demands and counter-proposals from the body after agreement was reached on an initial tranche of shares. Discussions have entered a final, sensitive stage after extensive consultation with legal and financial advisers. Must’s position is that United’s offer is not acceptable while the club’s stance is that they are working through the final demands of the trust. It is understood one of the trust’s issues relates to a technicality regarding the Glazers’ share-voting power. As part of the process, Glazer is in discussion with his five siblings – Avram, Darcie, Kevin, Bryan and Edward. All of them have to sign off on a final agreement. If the fan share scheme does go ahead, the new shares issued would be part of a “B” category, meaning they would match those owned by the Glazers and have 10-times the voting weight of “A” category, which are owned by most investors.",Sport/Football,Manchester United’s fans’ share scheme in deadlock a year after being proposed ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/07/manchester-uniteds-fans-share-scheme-in-deadlock-a-year-after-being-proposed
4/7/2022,"Hello and good morning, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said yesterday that new sanctions by the west against Russia did not go far enough and would be seen by invading forces as a “permission to attack”, as fears of an assault on the east of the country intensify. Zelenskiy’s comments come after the US, UK and EU unveiled a raft of new sanctions targeting Russian banks and the country’s elites. The US measures include a ban on investing in Russia as well as sanctions on president Vladimir Putin’s adult daughters. The EU sanctions include a ban on coal imports and restrictions on banks. “This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address. “If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons … it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to attack.” What sanctions does Zelenskiy want? He called for the west to reject Russian oil and completely block the country’s banks from the international finance system. What’s the latest on a potential Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine? The Kremlin has said it intends to seize the entire self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, with Putin reportedly keen to declare victory by 9 May, the annual second world war commemoration. How is Ukraine responding to the fresh offensive threat? Ukraine urged civilians to leave the east of the country while they still could. Meanwhile, the Pentagon said a “small number” of Ukrainian soldiers were being trained in the US to operate Switchblade drones. What is the international community doing? The UN general assembly will vote today on whether to suspend Russia from the UN premier human rights body after discoveries of potential Russian war crimes. Nato foreign ministers also meet today in Brussels for talks on providing support to bring an end to the war. Meanwhile, the Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, offered some optimism about the Ukraine resistance. “Of course, they can win this. And if you look at what they’ve been able to do just thus far, Mr Putin has achieved exactly zero of his strategic objectives inside Ukraine,” he said. The House voted yesterday to hold two of Donald Trump’s top advisers – Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino – in criminal contempt of Congress. That’s because of their months-long refusal to comply with subpoenas issued by the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack. The approval of the contempt resolution, by a vote of 220 to 203, sets the two Trump aides on the path toward criminal prosecution by the justice department as the panel escalates its inquiry into whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. Congressman Jamie Raskin, a member of the select committee who introduced the contempt resolution to the House floor, said the select committee needed the House to advance the measure in order to reaffirm the consequences for defying the January 6 investigation. What punishment could the advisers face if convicted? Up to a year in federal prison, $100,000 in fines – or both. Why won’t Navarro and Scavino testify? It means the select committee can’t extract information from them about Trump’s unlawful scheme to have then vice-president Mike Pence stop the election certification. What happens next? The contempt citations now head to the justice department and the US attorney for the District of Columbia, Matthew Graves, who is required by law to weigh a prosecution. The chief executive of the bedding company MyPillow, Mike Lindell, has been sued for defamation by a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems. Eric Coomer, the former employee of the voting machines company that became embroiled in Donald Trump’s false claims that he was denied victory at the 2020 election because of widespread voter fraud, has filed a court complaint against Lindell. The suit alleges that Lindell, and his media platform Frankspeech, targeted Coomer as part of his “efforts to undermine faith in American democracy and enrich himself in the process”. Who is the MyPillow boss? Mike Lindell is a Trump supporter, conservative activist and conspiracy theorist who supported baseless claims the 2020 election was rigged. What did Lindell say about the lawsuit? “MyPillow and Frankspeech didn’t do nothing,” he said in a statement after being handed the lawsuit at a rally in Denver, Colorado. “They’re trying to cancel Frankspeech, your favorite show!” North Korea could hold a nuclear weapon test next week, a senior US official warned. A potential test, on the 110th anniversary of founder Kim Il-sung’s birth, would be the country’s first in five years. The US state department’s Sung Kim urged North Korea to de-escalate.

4/7/2022,"This August, tens of millions of Africans will turn their attention to Kenya’s general election. Kenya’s recent history features hotly contested, sometimes violent elections in which candidates and their allies have used tribal politics to turn people against one another. Yet as this election approaches, one of the biggest dangers comes much further from home: US and Chinese tech platforms. Before unpacking the dangerous role that tech platforms are playing in Kenya, it’s important to understand the high stakes. For many Kenyans, this is the mother of all elections. The country’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta of the Jubilee party, has overseen an economy battered by inflation and debt, bruised by corruption and struggling to get on its feet due to the harm inflicted by Covid. Fighting to be the next president are Kenyatta’s deputy, William Ruto, and the leader of the opposition, Raila Odinga, of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). The last time Kenyatta and Ruto were on opposing sides of an election, in 2007 and 2008, the country was plagued by violence, and they ended up on trial in the international criminal court (ICC). (Kenyatta’s charges were dropped in December 2014, and the court terminated Ruto’s case due to weak evidence.) Essential discussions about the election are unfolding on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok. It’s on these platforms that crucial civic information – but also disinformation and hate speech – will be amplified. Meanwhile, Kenya receives just a fraction of the resources – if that – that platforms give to address similar issues in western elections. They have acquired a massive civic responsibility in our countries – one that they are having trouble accepting. These platforms already have an unpleasant history of abetting election disinformation across Kenya. In 2013 and 2017, Kenyatta’s campaigns used Cambridge Analytica to create election branding and messaging that critics called “divisive propaganda” that inflamed ethnic tensions. Similarly, Google ran poisonous attack ads under the banner “The Real Raila” on its search and YouTube products from Harris Media – a Texas-based rightwing media company that was also hired by Trump during his 2016 campaigns. Now it’s happening all over again. In the past few months, work I published with Mozilla reported how Twitter’s complacency has allowed for the development of a thriving disinformation industry in Kenya, comprised of influencers-for-hire who sell their services on the platform to politicians and political groups. This industry has repeatedly been used by various problematic actors to consolidate power and neutralise public outcry, from lawmakers (or their proxies) to political groups abroad. For example, in 2021 Kenyan judges and activists underwent wave after wave of attacks on Twitter as Kenyatta and Odinga sought to get their elite pact, titled ​​Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), past the courts. Further investigations found that the same shady industry attempted to neutralise public outcry after Kenyatta was implicated in Africa Uncensored’s Pandora Papers revelations (along with other news organisations worldwide) in late 2021. (Kenyatta said the papers “would go a long way in enhancing financial transparency required in Kenya”, but never responded to his presence in the documents.) It doesn’t stop there. Rightwing political organisations in places such as Spain have been using platforms to meddle with Kenyans’ civic debate online. The Spanish organisation CitizenGO ran campaigns over the past few years that Twitter amplified through its trending algorithm to millions of Kenyans in an attempt to oust politicians who support progressive legislation. Meanwhile, allegations about Facebook’s moderation efforts in Africa dim any optimism that big tech companies might learn from past failures. Time recently reported on the alleged poor pay and working conditions of Facebook’s content moderators in Kenya. Moderators claimed that speed was prioritised over all else, including health. There are many criticisms that Facebook content moderators around the world are treated poorly, but the low pay and poor conditions in Africa are especially stark. African moderators accused Meta and Sama (Meta’s moderation subcontractor) of discrimination and rights abuses after the working conditions left many of them with PTSD. Since the revelations came to light Meta and Sama have been served with legal letters for breaking multiple sections of Kenya’s labour laws. Such a situation means that hate speech and incitement will continue to run rampant on the platform. Disinformation has been allowed to fester in east Africa, especially when compared to regions like North America and western Europe. This is evidence of two larger problems. The first is US tech platforms’ context bias in Africa. US platforms and the people who run them – most of whom are based in California – simply don’t know the histories and norms of African democracy. Secondly, platform moderation and policies guiding AI regulation are enabling colonial interference, culturally and politically in digital spaces. As the Kenyan researcher and political analyst Nanjala Nyabola asks in reference to Cambridge Analytica’s hand in the Kenyan election: “What does accountability for political misinformation look like when a British company uses an American platform to influence political discourse in a Kenyan election?” There are few incentives for platforms to address these problems. Big tech’s choices are consistently driven by public perception, business risk, the threat of regulation and the spectacle of PR fires. That’s why platforms are quick to scrub QAnon content in the US or meet GDPR regulations in the EU, but don’t show the same attention when dealing with health disinformation in Kenya, or adhering to the country’s incitement laws. The policies and values of these platforms have normalised a kind of deviance – one that enables a dismissal of regions and populations that fall in its “rest of the world” category. As the election draws nearer, many platforms are still unwilling to publicly commit to a roadmap that outlines how they are going to fight misinformation and disinformation in Kenya and Africa more broadly. We need platforms to inform Kenyan users about how they will use algorithms to spot hate speech and election-related disinformation; how they will foster relationships with civil society to factcheck content in English, Kiswahili and Sheng; and finally, how they’ll help Kenyans get accurate information about where to vote. Election disinformation is not a problem that platforms can fix on their own. However, they have an outsized responsibility to protect Kenyan civil society and our democratic discourse.
