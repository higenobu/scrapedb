5/4/2022,"The World Trade Organization’s (WTO) most powerful members said on Tuesday that they had agreed on a proposed waiver on intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines in the hopes of speeding up rollouts worldwide. The proposal from the so-called Quad (the European Union, India, South Africa and the United States) will still have to go to the full council, but China has indicated it is prepared to vote in favour. If passed, it could allow developing world countries to manufacture Covid vaccines without paying Pfizer, Moderna and other pharmaceutical companies licenses. WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has made vaccine equity her top priority since taking office in 2021. She has been working for months to broker a compromise after an 18-month-long impasse. “What the discussions were aiming at was coming up with something workable,” Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters, saying she hoped the WTO’s 164 members would finalise and approve the proposal by June. “This will advance the discussion and dialogue. For the next pandemic or a flare-up of this one, this is hugely important,” she said. Vaccination rates in wealthy countries are now between 70% and 90%, and many are discussing a fourth round of injections. But in poorer countries vaccination rates remain low, due to cost and lack of supply. More than 30 countries have vaccinated less than 10% of their population, according to the Multilateral Leaders Taskforce on Covid-19. The pharmaceutical industry has lobbied against the move and other critics have charged that waiving patents will still not solve vaccine inequity in the short-term because manufacturing and supply issues will remain. The document showed that there were still unresolved areas in the draft deal, including on the duration of the waiver’s application which could be either three or five years. Okonjo-Iweala said recent negotiations had focused on getting broader support for the deal, including from China. She said Beijing had indicated it was “favourably disposed” to being considered as a developed country in this deal and thus subject to stricter rules. The Chinese mission to the WTO in Geneva did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters contributed to this article.

5/4/2022,"With seven minutes left of normal time in a fractious, frayed encounter that they had dominated, Bournemouth were close to squandering their first chance to confirm automatic promotion. Then Kieffer Moore, a substitute who has largely been sidelined through injury after his move from Cardiff, finished a cunning free-kick routine with panache and the celebrations could begin; Nottingham Forest, so hopeful of taking three points that would tilt the race in their favour, did not ultimately do enough and will seek to atone in the playoffs. It is a triumph for Scott Parker, relegated with Fulham last season but now able to lead Bournemouth back into the big time after two seasons away. If Bournemouth had needed an extra boost at the outset, it came through an announcement from their midfielder David Brooks that he is clear of the stage two Hodgkin lymphoma with which he was diagnosed in October. Brooks is a talent worthy of the Premier League and it will be a joy to see him back on the pitch; above all, though, the Wales international’s good health was worth celebrating. Forest would happily face him in the top flight next season. This had been billed as their biggest game in the 23 years since their relegation in the Premier League: it was not hard to see why, given their lack of dalliances with automatic promotion in the interim. Steve Cooper’s side were seen off from their training ground on Monday by several hundred fans and a smog of red flares; they were raucously backed here, too, by a contingent who sensed the shedding of all those disappointments. Their players began as if encumbered, Bournemouth settling quickly and coming close when Brice Samba pawed away Philip Billing’s curled effort. Steve Cook, the centre-back who was a crucial component of the Cherries’ rise last decade but was allowed to join Forest in January with a showdown of this magnitude presumably not in mind, turned the polite applause that greeted him into boos when he chopped down Dominic Solanke. When Forest calmed, they came within inches of scoring through another familiar face to the locals. Sam Surridge never quite caught light here and, via Stoke, arrived at Forest soon after Cook. He had scored seven league goals since then, three of them against Swansea on Saturday, and sensed an eighth when Djed Spence drove infield and played him through on the left. His rasping drive twanged the top of the bar but Bournemouth had been warned. The sides having traded those blows within 10 minutes, proceedings became scratchier. It was as if everyone had belatedly realised what was at stake: the tempo grew fitful and neither goal was troubled again until just before the half-hour. Jack Colback’s marvellously-timed intervention denied Ryan Christie a goal at the far post and then Forest came closer, Jordan Zemura blocking Brennan Johnson’s low shot in front of the line after Philip Zinckernagel’s centre had found him unmarked. Johnson then tamed Spence’s high pass masterfully before shooting at Mark Travers in the home goal. That was as deft a move as anyone managed during a half whose tension had become increasingly palpable. But Forest could go in feeling aggrieved after Surridge was clipped by Travers in the box as he rounded him; he was ruled offside, but replays showed the decision to have been incorrect and fortunes can turn on such calls. Cook was fortunate not to be booked when, soon after the restart, he crudely halted Solanke again. The striker hit the side netting in the next significant action and there was a sense Parker, surely frustrated by his Bournemouth side’s slow opening period, had sent them out with resounding instructions to complete the job. Now they looked far crisper, although Christie shot wastefully after a strong run. Parker introduced the 6ft 5in Moore to give Solanke an accomplice and Forest, convincing when they showed adventure before the interval, had barely mounted a second-half attack as the final quarter dawned. Billing should have exposed them after picking Ryan Yates’s pocket but, with time and space on the left, allowed Samba an easy block as teammates queued up. Samba then repelled Jaidon Anthony’s shot and, if a goal was coming, only one side looked capable of it. The only surprise was that Forest seemed to have steadied before Moore’s clincher. But they were unsettled by a darting run from the left by Zemura, who was fouled on the 18-yard line by Scott McKenna. From the most inviting of positions, Billing shaped to have a crack; instead, with perfect choreography, he slipped the ball left to Moore and the resulting first-time, slide-rule finish sent Bournemouth to the promised land.",Sport/Football,Bournemouth’s Moore seals promotion to Premier League and frustrates Forest,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/03/bournemouth-nottingham-forest-championship-match-report
5/4/2022,"My aunt Minny McCormack, who has died aged 102, was among the first German women allowed to marry a British soldier after the second world war and was one of the last living war brides. That soldier, my uncle, Jim McCormack, fell in love with her soon after knocking on her door and asking for a cup of tea in war-ravaged Aachen in September 1945. His unit had taken over the adjacent manor house. A year later, she left Germany for Jim’s home in Liverpool. They were married in 1946 and she stayed in the UK for the next 75 years. Born Berta Wilhemine Roessler, shortened to Minny, in Aachen, to Berta (nee von Knappen) and Emil Roessler, a chauffeur and estate administrator, she went to secondary school in the city, leaving at 16 to start an apprenticeship at a local pharmaceutical company. Aged 19 when war broke out in 1939, Minny got through the first years with no more hardship than other German civilians. But things got worse for her after D-day. In October 1944, American troops took Aachen, the first German city to fall to the allies. She fled east on a bicycle, on foot and on the back of trucks, carrying only essential belongings in suitcases. For four months, she spent nights in woods, barns and abandoned buildings, once sheltering under a railway carriage during an allied air raid. Only in May 1945, once Germany had surrendered, did she slowly make her way back to her home in bomb-shattered Aachen, where a period of desperate hand-to-mouth existence began in a country on its knees. Enter Jim, whose command of the German language made it easy for the couple to quickly get to know each other. Romance blossomed while Minny worked for Jim’s Intelligence Corps section in return for food, cooking for them while they went about the postwar hunt for Nazis fleeing over the border into the Netherlands. After marriage, Jim and Minny settled in Carshalton Beeches, Surrey, bringing up their only child, Ingrid, in a bilingual and bicultural manner – a brave move in postwar Britain. Jim died of a brain tumour in 1972, leaving Minny a widow for 50 years. But she stayed in the UK, remaining close to the wider McCormack family, teaching German at Sutton College of Learning for Adults and involving herself in her local church. In her mid-90s she moved to the Cotswolds to be near to Ingrid, who wrote up her parents’ story in The Bride’s Trunk: A Story of War and Reconciliation. Minny is survived by Ingrid and her grandchildren, Matthew and Gabriela.",News/World news,Minny McCormack obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/minny-mccormack-obituary
5/4/2022,"It is not the done thing for candidates for the Metropolitan police commissionership to publicly discuss their candidacy, and those who apply will face an anxious wait to see if they have made the shortlist. Of the possible candidates remaining, Mark Rowley is a proven operator under intense pressure on a national stage. He was head of counter-terrorism in 2017 when Britain was hit by a wave of terror attacks in London and Manchester. Rowley was close to the commissioner before Cressida Dick, Bernard Hogan-Howe, and seen as intelligent and a moderniser. He applied in 2017 and lost out to Dick. One strike against him then was tension with Theresa May, then the home secretary. But in truth, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, was in the driving seat to select the Met commissioner, and saw a chance to make history by appointing Dick as the first-ever female holder of the top policing post. Rowley started as a beat officer in the West Midlands, where he was savagely attacked by a gang of football hooligans. He rose to become the chief of Surrey police, joining the Met as an assistant commissioner. He left policing in 2018. In his time away he co-wrote a report on extremism and also wrote critically of the Met’s use of stop and search. As well as being chief constable of the Devon and Constable force, Sawyer leads for police chiefs on performance. That is where he has face time with ministers and officials, and has impressed some. He has had to negotiate a government wanting some measures on performance amid concerns from chiefs it is a return to priority-skewing targets. Sawyer will stand down as chief of the south-western force in August. His toughest time was the shooting in Plymouth when five people died at the hands of gunman Jake Davison. Police face a hard time explaining their decision to return a gun licence to Davison just before the shooting, having taken it away for an alleged clash in the street. Sawyer previously served in the Met tackling violence, and also as a commander in counter-terrorism. He recently applied to be the head of the policing inspectorate, losing out to Andy Cooke. “Ticks the boxes,” said one fellow chief, who added: “He is popular with some in the Home Office.” City Hall sources would also be interested in Andy Marsh’s ideas for the Met. Marsh has recently been appointed as chief executive officer at the College of Policing, which sets the standards for law enforcement. The timing of this appointment may be one factor deterring him from applying for the Met commissionership. He describes himself as “a transformational chief constable” having led two forces, first Hampshire and then Avon and Somerset. There he suffered the wrath of government when a statue of a slave owner was pulled down and dumped in a canal during Black Lives Matter protests. Some in government thought police should have done more to intervene. Marsh can talk engagingly about how greater use of data and analytics can boost crime fighting, music to the ears of the policing minister, Kit Malthouse. An assistant commissioner in the Met, Ephgrave fronted the Met’s press conference after Wayne Couzens was sentenced to a whole-life term for the murder of Sarah Everard. Two sources say he may be considering a bid. Few think a Met insider is what government or City Hall want, but Ephgrave can be personable and insightful. He is a former chief of Surrey police. Currently a Met assistant commissioner and head of counter-terrorism, Jukes was a former chief of South Wales police and pioneer of police use of live facial recognition technology, an initiative steeped in controversy. May sit this round out and be a strong contender for deputy commissioner and likely candidate next time. Stephen House, acting commissioner, was Dick’s deputy and the first chief of Police Scotland when all its forces joined to create a single one. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs council, is a former Met assistant commissioner who joined policing from the military. Dave Thompson, outgoing chief of West Midlands, was well regarded but never really fancied the Met’s top job. Simon Byrne, chief of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, whose reputation as a Met assistant commissioner would have made him the candidate feared by sections of the Met rank and file.",News/UK news,Met police commissioner: likely candidates to succeed Cressida Dick,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/03/met-police-commissioner-likely-candidates-to-succeed-cressida-dick
5/4/2022,"Boris Johnson’s fumbled defence of the government’s record on the cost of living has exasperated Conservative MPs and sharpened fears about the party’s performance in Thursday’s local elections. Asked about a pensioner forced to travel around on buses to stay warm and keep heating bills down, the prime minister’s first response was to boast that he introduced free travel for older people. During the interview on Tuesday, he admitted that the government had failed to do enough to alleviate the pain of soaring costs. Amid growing fears over the impact of the cost of living crisis, the Treasury is looking at whether it can cover some or all of this autumn’s energy price rise from government funds, the Guardian has learned. It is understood that Rishi Sunak’s department has been examining whether to simply absorb most of the cost, rather than offer a discount on bills or a council tax rebate. Sunak is concerned about the inflationary impact of more borrowing – but the option of absorbing some or all of the rise has been considered. A Treasury source said they “don’t recognise this as policy work being done at this point in time”. A spokesperson added: “Energy bills are capped until the autumn. We won’t know yet what the size of the rise will be given the volatility of prices we are seeing now and it’s right that we wait … [to] decide what the solution should be.” Thursday’s vote will be the first UK-wide electoral test since details emerged of lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street. Tory MPs are braced for losses in London and the south of England as a toxic combination of Partygate and the rocketing cost of living take their toll. MPs in northern England said they are more confident of holding on to local councillors. In a pre-election interview on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, the prime minister struggled to articulate what help may be available to a pensioner struggling to make ends meet. Asked about Elsie, a 77-year-old who has cut back on meals and uses buses to stay warm, he responded: “The 24-hour freedom bus pass was actually something that I introduced.” Asked what more Elsie could cut back on, he said he “didn’t want her to have to cut back on anything”. With concerns about the cost of living a major election issue, some Tory MPs responded with irritation to Johnson’s performance. “The thing with him is, he hasn’t read the script sometimes,” said one. “There are so many positive things he could have said.” Another backbencher and former cabinet minister said: “It won’t have won us many votes. Boris doesn’t actually care about these people. He basically despises most of the human race, so that makes it quite difficult for him to sympathise.” The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jon Ashworth, said that “boasting about the London bus pass reveals just how out of touch this narcissistic prime minister is”. He added that the state pension had just suffered the biggest real-terms cut in 50 years. Both main parties are desperately trying to manage expectations before Thursday’s elections, with the Tories warning of as many as 800 losses out of more than 5,000 council seats being contested, and Labour suggesting they could make few gains. The Conservative peer and elections expert, Robert Hayward, said he projected net Tory losses of 250 to 350 seats, adding: “That will mean one or two headline Labour gains but whether that is good enough for them to be comfortable is a question mark.” Tory insiders say there are serious jitters about losing the London council of Wandsworth, though Labour said that is unlikely. A senior Tory figure said the area had become more affluent over time, which might usually favour the Tories, but instead it had seen “gentrification with remainers”. A London MP warned that among middle class, “middle-of-the-road” voters in the south of England, “it’s a Boris problem”. One senior Lib Dem strategist said the party was looking at possible gains in the new Somerset unitary authority, Oxford, Wimbledon and Woking in the south, as well as Westmoreland and Hull in the north. “We don’t expect significant takeovers of loads of different councils but we hope to see steady progress in the blue seats that are up,” they said. By contrast, “red wall” Conservatives are quietly confident of holding on to their council seats. – In key local council fights – such as Bury, Bolton, Wigan and Hartlepool – which will be seen to foreshadow whether Labour will be able to retake or hold seats at the next elections, Tories described voters as angry with Johnson over Partygate, but unwilling to make the switch to Labour. One Midlands Tory in a newly won constituency seat said: “Logically, we should actually be in a position to make gains, but Partygate and the cost of living are meaning our voters are not reliably turning out. But I’m not detecting people going back to Labour at all.” A Tory MP in north-west England said they feared that anger towards Johnson was unlikely to dissipate by the next general election, though voters were prepared to keep voting Tory locally because Labour were still seen as the establishment force. “I think the anger is now a permanent feature. We can, in a sense, get away with it this time because he’s not on the ballot paper. But this is definitely going to be held against us at a general election.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s ‘out of touch’ comments on cost of living crisis anger Tory MPs,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/03/boris-johnsons-out-of-touch-comments-on-cost-of-living-crisis-anger-tory-mps
