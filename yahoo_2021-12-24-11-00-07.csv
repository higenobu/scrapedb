12/24/2021,"Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said her office has been bombarded with racist comments since her announcement of vaccine requirements for entry into indoor establishments.

Driving the news: On Monday, Wu said that individuals entering indoor spaces for dining, fitness and entertainment must present proof of COVID-19 vaccination starting January 2022. The policy has been introduced as “B Together.”
 Next year, all patrons,employees and everyone else aged 12 and above must provide proof of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine from Jan. 15 onward, while proof of two doses will be required starting on Feb. 15. Children aged 5-11 must provide proof of at least one dose starting on March 1. From May 1 onward, people aged 5 and above must provide proof of full vaccination. The requirement covers three categories: indoor dining, which includes bars and restaurants; indoor fitness, which includes gyms and dance studios; and indoor entertainment, which includes movie theaters, museums and professional sports arenas. Acceptable forms of proof include a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccination card, a photo of that card or a photo of any official immunization record. Proof can also be shown through the City of Boston app or a COVID-19 vaccine verification app. “Today we are facing another winter surge with the Omicron variant, but there is a key difference between last winter and today: vaccines,” Wu said on Monday, as per WBUR. “Vaccines are the most powerful tool we have to fight this pandemic.” City employees who have not been vaccinated must comply “by the Jan. 15 deadline as a condition of employment.” Wu said more than 90% of Boston’s 18,000 workers have already received a vaccination, according to NBC Boston. 
 


What critics are saying: Wu’s policy received both criticism and support. According to Wu, some of her critics even sent racist and hateful messages to her office.
 On Twitter, several users are referring to Wu as “Mayor Wuhan” and “Michelle Wuhan.” “‘Mayor Wuhan’ is a fantastic moniker,” one user wrote. “Michelle Wuhan just crippled people’s businesses,” another user wrote. “She clearly works for China.” Protesters also gathered outside Boston City Hall on Monday, chanting “USA!” and singing lines from the national anthem. They were joined by Republican gubernatorial candidate Geoff Diehl, who called the vaccine requirements “clear violations of the civil rights of anyone who lives in, works in or travels to the city, and will make it even more difficult for Boston’s economy to recover from the pandemic.”   The big picture: Wu, the first woman and first person of color elected as Boston’s mayor, told Boston Public Radio that she receives “another dozen hateful messages” every time she opens her phone. She said her experience is shared by other women of color and people of color in leadership positions, notably Asian Americans, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “I've grown up my whole life knowing what it feels like to feel invisible or othered, and this is an experience that far too many Americans share,” Wu said, according to GBH News. “Standing at the podium, hearing the demonstrators who were opposing our policies singing patriotic songs and chanting ‘USA’ — the message was clear that we don't belong here in their eyes, and shouldn't be trying to take away something that they perceive they have and are losing.” Despite the opposition, Wu remains steadfast in implementing her policy. “This is the right thing to do, and we’re not going to be intimidated away from doing it,” she said, as per the Boston Globe.

12/24/2021,"The US Omicron wave could peak sharply in January, then bottom out in March, new models suggest. Omicron could represent the swiftest outbreak in the US to date, lasting no more than three months. But hospitalizations and deaths are still expected to rise as the variant becomes more widespread. Almost as quickly as the Omicron variant has torn through the US, some scientists are predicting it will decline. New models suggest that the US's Omicron outbreak may peak in January and last no more than three months. That would make this latest wave much steeper and swifter than its predecessors. ""When you have something that goes up this quickly, often you see it come right back down,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci told ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday. ""Because what will happen is that almost everyone is either going to get infected, particularly the unvaccinated, or be vaccinated."" A recent report from the University of Texas estimated that Omicron cases could peak between January 18 and February 3, depending on how well the variant transmits or evades immunity relative to Delta. At the height of the winter surge, COVID-19 cases could reach between 230,000 and 550,000 a day, the model suggests. The US has been recently reporting about 170,000 daily COVID-19 cases on average, as shown in the chart below from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Daily COVID-19 cases could also bottom out in March, the report said, even as Omicron remained prevalent. Another model from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projects that coronavirus infections may peak at more than 2.8 million cases a day around January 27, then drop to fewer than 700,000 daily infections by April. That trajectory wouldn't be surprising, scientists say: A highly transmissible virus tends to burn quickly through a population until it runs out of people to infect — and Omicron could be the most transmissible coronavirus variant to date. ""As the transmission moves from an outbreak setting to a household setting, where you're really starting to talk about infecting one or two people at a time, then you see that growth slow down,"" David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Insider. ""Anytime you see these new outbreaks popping up, they start off with a bang,"" he added. ""It doesn't mean that they're going to stay that way forever."" Omicron already seems to have passed its peak in South Africa, which first reported it to the World Health Organization, roughly one month after scientists first spotted it there. Daily COVID-19 cases in South Africa have fallen 24% on average over the past week after reaching a record high of nearly 38,000 cases on December 12. But widespread Omicron cases could still bring a punishing surge of hospitalizations in the US. ""Even in my own hospitals that I work at, we're already starting to see more and more cases of COVID,"" Dr. Vivek Cherian, a Chicago internal-medicine physician, told Insider. Daily coronavirus infections in the US could reach a record high by January, the IHME model suggests. But that doesn't necessarily mean that vaccinated people will get sicker: Early data indicates that Omicron causes less severe illness than Delta does, perhaps because more people have some degree of immunity against the coronavirus already, either from vaccines or natural infection. On the whole, hospitalizations and deaths are likely to rise the more Omicron spreads. Omicron cases are doubling every two to three days in the US, and a recent report from Imperial College London suggested the variant increased the risk of reinfection by more than fivefold compared with Delta. Within two to three months, more than 60% of all Americans could be infected with Omicron, the IHME model indicates. According to the model, more than 90% of those Omicron cases will likely be asymptomatic, but deaths could still increase considerably in January. IHME predicted that COVID-19 deaths would peak around February 4 at more than 2,000 a day. The University of Texas' model suggests hospitalizations may climb to roughly 10,000 to 30,000 a day, while deaths could reach between 1,500 and 3,900 a day. ""Under all scenarios, we expect that Omicron will quickly overtake Delta as the dominant variant and has the potential to cause the most severe COVID-19 healthcare surges to date,"" the University of Texas researchers wrote. Staffing shortages at hospitals, combined with a large share of unvaccinated people, could make it particularly difficult to treat patients. More than 38% of Americans are either unvaccinated or have received just one dose. ""Hospital capacity is already strained in many states,"" Faheem Younus, the chief of infectious diseases at the University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health, recently told Insider. ""We fear a repeat of early 2020, when surgeries were canceled and non-COVID care was impacted due to hospitals being overloaded with COVID.""

12/24/2021,"The parents of the Oxford High School shooting suspect knew that their son was depressed and heading down a dangerous and violent path, but they ignored his ""troubling"" texts and other red flags, failed to get him help and paid attention to their own lives instead, including having extramarital affairs, the prosecutor disclosed in a new court filing Thursday. ""The defendants had information long before Nov. 30 (six months prior to the shooting) that their son's only friend moved at the end of October, that the family dog died, that their son was sadder than usual, and that he was sending his mother disturbing texts about his state of mind,"" the prosecution wrote in a Thursday court filing. ""Instead of paying attention to their son and getting him help, they bought him a gun."" And they knew he had access to that gun on Nov. 30, the day 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley allegedly opened fire in a hallway at Oxford High School, killing four students and injuring seven others. Prosecutors said that Jennifer and James Crumbley kept the gun in an unlocked armoire cupboard. "" ... they knew that their son was depressed, that he was fascinated with guns ... that he had been researching ammunition while at a school and that he was seen watching violent videos of shootings that morning,"" the prosecutor wrote in her filing. ""Before they left school that day, they had also seen the disturbing drawings."" There were other signs that Ethan Crumbley needed help, prosecutors allege. ""Their son was torturing animals, even kept a baby bird's head in a jar on his bedroom floor, which he later took and placed in a school bathroom,"" the prosecutor's filing states. ""Meanwhile, the parents were focusing on their own issues, things like extramarital affairs, financial issues and substance abuse."" Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald also alleged that during this same time period, the Crumbleys spent their time at a barn caring for their horses three to four nights a week for up to three hours at a time, and ""seeking other relationships, including (the) mother's extramarital affairs."" More: Prosecutor reveals Oxford school shooting suspect's graphic drawing More: On 911 call, man said he found mom of Oxford High School shooter McDonald made this disclosure in a request to the court that James and Jennifer Crumbley remain locked up on $500,000 bond each, and that the couple not be granted a lower bond of $100,000 cash, as requested by the defense on Wednesday. The defense has argued that the Crumbleys pose no danger to the public, are not a flight risk and have supporters in the community who will vouch for them. But the prosecution adamantly disagrees, arguing the higher bond amount is appropriate for a couple who knowingly and negligently failed to get help for their son when they knew he was struggling. McDonald also alleged in her filing that on the day of the shooting, Jennifer Crumbley gave misleading statements about the location of the gun that she had purchased for her son for Christmas, including telling her boyfriend that the gun was in her car. Instead, authorities have said, the gun was with her son. And it was her husband who noticed it missing after the shooting and called 911 to report it missing. The prosecution, meanwhile, argues that the Crumbleys are ""a greater risk of flight now"" than they were following their arraignment, noting they are $11,000 behind on house payments. Their house is currently for sale and they have sold their horses. The prosecutor's filing comes one day after defense lawyers asked a judge to lower Jennifer and James Crumbley's bond from $500,000 to $100,000 cash, arguing the couple poses no threat to society and can be trusted to remain free pending the outcome of their cases. The Crumbleys are facing involuntary manslaughter charges in a novel case that seeks to hold parents responsible, in part, for a deadly school shooting. According to prosecutors, the parents bought the gun that was used in the shooting as an early Christmas present for their son, who is facing terrorism and first-degree murder charges. Police say Ethan Crumbley opened fire in a hallway after exiting a bathroom, just shortly after meeting with counselors and his parents at school over some behavior issues. More: Oxford school shooting suspect's mom texted son not to kill himself, lawyers say More: Oxford school shooting lasted 5 minutes. On social media, it never ended. According to police and the prosecution, Ethan Crumbley was seen in class browsing for ammunition on his cellphone a day before the massacre. The next day, he was found with a note depicting a handgun with the words, ""The thoughts won't stop. Help me,"" and a sketch of someone bleeding. His parents refused to take him home. The student was returned to class with his backpack, which was never searched and police now saying it contained the gun that was used in the attack. ""All they had to do was tell the school that they recently purchased a gun for their son, and asked him where the gun was, open his backpack, or just take him home,"" McDonald argued in Thursday's filing. The defense argues that the parents had no way of knowing their son would open fire that day. ""The Crumbleys, like every parent and community member, are devastated by the school shooting,"" defense lawyers have argued in court documents. ""The last thing they expected was that a school shooting would take place, or that their son would be responsible. This situation is entirely devastating."" The defense believes prosecutors face an uphill battle and will fail to prove their case. The parents ""did not know Ethan was a threat to anyone; and they certainly did not anticipate or cause the tragedy that unfolded at Oxford High School,"" the defense has argued. The Nov. 30 shooting left four students dead and seven other people injured, including a teacher. According to prosecutors, four days before the shooting, the Crumbleys bought Ethan the gun that was used in the massacre. Bond was denied to Ethan Crumbley. His lawyers tried earlier this month to get the teenager moved out of jail and into a juvenile facility, arguing he had never been in trouble before and that the shooting was an ""isolated incident."" The judge, however, denied the request and concluded that Ethan Crumbley belongs in an adult jail pending the outcome of his case.  The Crumbleys and their son are housed in the Oakland County Jail, though none has any communication with the other. A bond hearing for the parents has been set for Jan. 7. According to prosecutors, the parents did not have the gun properly secured. The defense has disputed that, stating in court records, ""the Crumbleys did have the gun at issue in a locked and hidden location."" Killed in the shootings were Hana St. Juliana, 14; Tate Myre, 16; Madisyn Baldwin, 17, and Justin Shilling, 17. Separately, a civil lawsuit seeking $100 million has been filed against the school district on behalf of a student who was shot in the neck and survived, and her younger sister who watched it happen. The lawsuit alleges that the school district put students in harm's way by ignoring signs of a troubled teen who was allowed to return to class after exhibiting troubling behavior in class, both on the day of the shootings and the day before. His parents were summoned, and a meeting with counselors and their son followed. The parents resisted taking him out of school. He was sent back to class with his backpack, which police said they believe contained the gun used in the shootings. According to school officials, Ethan Crumbley explained that the drawing of the gun and blood was part of a video game design, and that counselors did not believe he might harm others based on his ""behavior, responses and demeanor,"" so they let him return to class. The defense has argued that McDonald has filed ""inappropriate"" charges against the parents, and has accused the prosecutor of charging the parents "" out of anger"" and in ""in an effort to send a message to gun owners."" McDonald has publicly stated that she knows it's a novel case, and that she has faced ""pushback"" from inside her office for bringing the case. But she maintains the charges are warranted. ""I want to be really clear that these charges are intended to hold individuals who contributed to this tragedy accountable and also send a message that gun owners have a responsibility. When they fail to uphold that responsibility, there are serious and criminal consequences,"" McDonald has previously said, stressing the 15-year-old's note in class was especially alarming. "" (R)eading the words, 'Help me' with a gun, blood everywhere,"" McDonald said, "" ... that a parent could read those words and know that their son had access to a deadly weapon that they gave him is unconscionable, and I think criminal. It is criminal.

12/24/2021,"By Josh Smith and Hyonhee Shin SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's President Moon Jae-in granted a pardon to former President Park Geun-hye, who is in prison after being convicted of corruption, the justice ministry said on Friday, amid a tight presidential race. Park, 69, became South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be thrown out of office when the Constitutional Court upheld a parliament vote in 2017 to impeach her over a scandal that also landed the heads of two conglomerates, including Samsung Electronics, in jail. She was brought down after being found guilty of colluding with a confidante to receive tens of billions of won from major conglomerates to help her family and fund nonprofit foundations she owned. In January, South Korea's top court upheld a 20-year prison sentence for Park on the graft charges that finalised her downfall, bringing an end to the legal process and for the first time raising the possibility of a pardon. But Park's predecessor Lee Myung-bak, who is also imprisoned on corruption charges, was not pardoned. ""We've included former President Park to overcome unfortunate past history, realise people's unity and provide a chance to take a new step forward to the future,"" Justice Minister Park Beom-Kye told a briefing. The decision came as many supporters and politicians of the conservative main opposition People Power party have been calling for Park's pardon ahead of the March presidential election. The flag bearer of Moon's ruling Democratic Party, Lee Jae-myung, and People Power's candidate Yoon Suk-yeol are seen neck and neck in recent polls. Opposition lawmakers have said that Park has experienced health problems while in prison, including undergoing shoulder surgery.

12/24/2021,"Seoul — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un looked grim at a ceremony to mark 10 years since his father's death over the weekend. But just over the border in Seoul, South Korea, a haircut was transforming Kim Min Yong, also known as Dragon Kim, into his alter ego. His adopted style, mirroring Kim Jong Un, is a convincing look, he says, but not exactly flattering. Dragon Kim's main work is counselling South Korean students as they apply for spots at prestigious American universities, but took his side hustle, impersonating the North Korean leader, online with his YouTube channel, KIMJONGUN TV. He offers a funny take on a deadly serious dictator, who's often shown in North Korean propaganda admiring new weapons in his arsenal — including a missile that could reach the United States. But is the faux Kim afraid of impersonating someone so powerful, especially after receiving online threats?  ""North Korean supporters say, 'if you mock our Dear Leader, you will be in trouble, like, big trouble!"" ""I was really scared,"" Dragon Kim admitted to CBS News. But with no serious reprisals after 10 years, he's still at it. There was one hiccup. In 2019, when Kim Jong Un met Donald Trump in Vietnam, Dragon Kim was there, too — doing his thing. Until, that is, the Vietnamese police picked him up and jailed him, just in case the visiting North Korean delegation was to find out about his antics and fail to take the joke. He said they kept him locked up for about six days. Vietnamese police aside, Dragon Kim has taken flak over the years. There's nothing funny, critics say, about a pitiless dictator. But he says they've missed the point. ""When I do Kim Jong Un impersonation, the funny things like the dancing and, you know, in public… I think that just helps to damage his authority,"" he told CBS News. And a little laughter may help him, and his fellow South Koreans live with the fact that the real Kim Jong Un is their next door neighbor, and he's starting his second decade in power, armed to the teeth.

12/24/2021,"In the crisscrossed, Q-addled conspiracy world where Donald Trump is held up as America’s great savior, and covid-19 vaccines are denounced as part of a poisonous plot to control the world, the former president’s own vaccination status — Trump privately got jabbed before departing the White House — has been an inconvenient truth. This contradiction shot to the surface again this week when the disgraced ex-president, in the midst of an arena tour with disgraced ex-Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly, told the crowd he’d gotten his booster shot. More from Rolling Stone Not So Down With Disease: Phish Postpone New Year's Concerts Over Omicron Concerns How the U.S. Shit the Bed on Tracking New Strains of Covid-19 The Jan. 6 Committee Says Jim Jordan Has Some Explaining to Do When some audience members booed, Trump chastised his critics. He touted the covid shots as a key part of his administration’s legacy: “We did something that was historic,” he said. “We got a vaccine done.” The twice-impeached Trump then touted the millions of lives saved around the world by the jabs. “Take credit for it,” he told his followers. “Don’t let them take it away, don’t take it away from ourselves. You’re playing right into their hands.” In fairness to the boo birds, the pro-booster message was an about-face for Trump, for whom consistency has never been a virtue. Over the summer he dismissed the notion of a third jab as “a money-making operation for Pfizer.” This message vibed with the anti-vax fever swamps, which have long decried Big Pharma for raking in profits by pushing vaccines that (they believe against all evidence) poison patients, instead of protecting them. As the president’s new, unabashed booster endorsement rippled out across right-wing social media, it was met with an combustible mix of anger, confusion, contorted excuses, and denial so pure it’s as if the former president had never uttered a word. For a sign of just how severely Trump wrong-footed himself with his base by endorsing boosters, look no further than the editorial cartoonist Ben Garrison. The doodler’s devotion to the 45th president has been slavish, but Garrison’s opposition to the vaccine has also been stalwart. His latest cartoon opus shows Trump riding aboard on the “Big Pharma Vaccine Bandwagon” as he’s booed by the MAGA-hatted masses. never thought i would see the day ben garrison turned on trump pic.twitter.com/6S89RL9UXz — kim possible facts (@kimpossiblefact) December 23, 2021 On the social media app Telegram, Ron Watkins — whom many believe role-played “Q” in the QAnon conspiracy that held up Trump as America’s heaven-sent savior in the battle against satanic Democrats — sent out a message on the day of Trump’s comments. Watkins blasted “the insidious global campaign to use poisonous injections to ‘save’ every living man woman, woman [and] child.” Watkins didn’t respond to Trump directly, but later urged the “VF” (or Vaccine Free community) to “stand strong,” “never fear,” and “never comply.” Two days later, Watkins was back to unvarnished anti-vax hysteria blasting jabs and boosters as “Subscription Suicide Shots.” Lin Wood, the high-profile, right-wing attorney who was a central player in the farcical legal campaign to overturn the results of the 2020 election, also took to Telegram after Trump spoke. Wood, who has touted the QAnon worldview and calls himself a “public advocate against” covid jabs, told his followers to hold their fire on Trump for “recommending the ‘vaccine’.” Wood called covid “a planned bioweapon” and cautioned patience: “I believe We The People should wait until ALL the facts are known before passing judgment on the President’s wartime strategy and the tactics designed to achieve victory.” (Wood’s appeal for patience fits a pattern. Anons have long overlooked facts that didn’t fit their worldview with calls to trust a long term “plan,” whose logic cannot always be discerned in the moment.) Later Wood took to Telegram, decrying his trolls: “Looks like I stirred up a hornet’s nest… Hornets must not like the TRUTH!!!” He again defended Trump: “You don’t have to agree with every statement President Trump makes or position he takes…. Judge the entire body of President Trump’s world as president… He loves America, freedom, and We the People.” General Michael Flynn, the Trump’s pardoned former national security adviser, was on Telegram on the day before the former president’s remarks opining that: “The vaccine doesn’t appear to work to prevent this covid madness, it appears to be causing it.” Flynn seemed to ignore Trump’s booster endorsement entirely. By the next day he’d posted a link to “news” item alleging Bill Gates and Tony Fauci had been “charged with genocide” in a filing before the International Criminal Court. Larry Cook — a top anti-vaxxer who once rivaled Robert Kennedy Jr. in his online reach before getting kicked off Facebook — runs the “Stop Mandatory Vaccination” online community. (Rolling Stone profiled Cook as part of this examination of the crossover between the anti-vax and Q Communities). A QAnon adherent and longtime Trump booster, Cook describes the vaccines as “experimental poisons.” He rails on his “Covid-19 Refusers” site that the “Deep State” seeks to “destroy our children through vaccination” as part of an effort to “usher in a one world government and police state for total Luciferian domination of every Child of God.” He took no notice of Trump’s vaccine endorsement — and instead used Telegram to promote a “powerful zeolite detox” spray that’s sold through his website. While MAGA and anti-vax leaders tried to excuse, dismiss or ignore the former president’s booster boosting, some in the rank-and-file of the far-right movement weren’t ready to forgive and forget, instead training their fire directly at the 45th president. A message posted to a popular Telegram channel dedicated to “controversial media” and “uncensored views” read: “How quickly ‘Trumpers’ and liberal-conservatives forget that this entire COVID debacle, including vaccines and mass vaccination, was initiated and promoted under Donald Trump and the Republican Party’s watch.” The post continued by arguing that Trump and the GOP don’t occupy the “moral high ground” on Covid and should not be trusted anymore than Biden and the Democrats: “Democrats are corrupt. Republicans are corrupt,” the post reads. “If you’re still on that merry-go-round then time to wake up and join us over here where TRUTH and FREEDOM is prioritised[sic] over party politics.” This sentiment was echoed by InfoWars host Alex Jones who used his platform to blast Trump for abandoning the fight of the anti-vaxxers. “Hell, we’re out here fighting Bill Gates and Fauci and Biden,” Jones said with disbelief: “And now we’ve got Trump on their team!” Alex Jones is flipping out after Trump said he got the booster: “Hell, we’re fighting Bill Gates and Fauci and Biden and the New World Order and Psaki and the Davos Group .. and now we’ve got Trump on their team!” pic.twitter.com/fyEfx1OcFp — Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) December 21, 2021 Best of Rolling Stone The Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign Anatomy of a Fake News Scandal The Radical Crusade of Mike Pence",Politics/Rolling Stone,MAGA Diehards Melt Down Over Trump’s Pro-Vax Push,https://news.yahoo.com/anti-vax-crusaders-excuse-ignore-212901592.html
