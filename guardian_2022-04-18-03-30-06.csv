Almost scored late on but fierce effort blocked. 6 Reece James Displayed his usual composure on the ball and always keen to launch attacks down the right. Effortless control in possession and also kept Wilfried Zaha reasonably quiet. Man of the match. 8 Jorginho Struggled in midfield and well off pace in first half. Lofted a ball hopelessly out of play to sum up sluggish showing. 6 Mateo Kovacic Failed to find his range with a cross which had too much power and appeared frustrated before being forced off early through injury. 6 Marcos Alonso Not overly effective as an attacking outlet down the left but grew into game as Chelsea dominated possession. 6 Timo Werner Failed to produce the fireworks of the last two games but troubled Palace with his relentless running and tireless work. Did well to play in Mason Mount for Chelsea’s second goal and nearly set up a third. 7 Mason Mount Produced a disappointing early cross which was too close to Jack Butland and quiet early on.

Powerful in the air. 7 Tyrick Mitchell Neat and tidy on the ball and occasionally combined down left with Zaha. Punished for losing ball at Chelsea’s breakthrough. 6 Jeffrey Schlupp Tireless worker and willing to put in hard graft to frustrate Chelsea. Should have done better though when misplacing an attacking pass. 6 Cheikhou Kouyaté Showed early promise in the midfield as he snuffed out Chelsea’s attacks. Almost opened the scoring with his fierce volley and headed wide from a great position in second half. 7 James McArthur Did well to cut out Werner’s cross and willing to track back and defend. Found it tough going in second half with Palace on defensive. 6 Eberechi Eze Lively on the odd occasion when given the chance to attack. Faded as the match progressed along with teammates. 6 Jean-Philippe Mateta Spurned an early opportunity after failing to take advantage of Zaha’s incisive pass and did not got much change out of the Chelsea defence. 6 Wilfried Zaha Produced a teasing early through ball which should have been capitalised on by Mateta.

4/18/2022,"This year’s Champions Cup has delivered a quarter-final lineup worthy of the competition’s grand standing in the game. Montpellier, Leicester and Leinster – respectively, leaders of the French and English leagues plus the multinational United Championship – are there. Toulouse – the Champions Cup holders and most successful club in the tournament’s history with five wins – are also in the mix. As are La Rochelle, finalists last season, and the two-time winners Munster. There is, however, a mismatch in the draw as one side of the equation is stacked with past champions while the other half can only point to four unsuccessful finals as a sign of their collective continental pedigree. Leicester, back-to-back champions in 2001 and 2002, were not at their best on Saturday in a 27-17 win against Clermont, but still took the tie with a commanding 56-27 aggregate score. “It was piss poor,” was the captain Ellis Genge’s assessment of a staccato display that lacked the usual precision of a unit coached by Steve Borthwick. “It’s not what we are about,” Genge said. “We train really, really tough and not to produce stuff like that. We’ve had a bollocking and we’ll sort it.” They will have to if they have any design on beating the four-time winners Leinster, who are in imperious form and dispatched Connacht 56-20 in Dublin on Friday. “Leinster are big-game players and big boys,” Genge said. “We’ve got to be on our jobs.” Munster are 10 points behind their rivals in the Irish pool of the United Championship but were equally impressive in beating Exeter 26-10 in Limerick, overcoming a first-leg defeat in Devon. They next host Toulouse, who needed a 75th-minute try from Antoine Dupont to edge Ulster by a single point on aggregate. Between them, Leicester, Leinster, Munster and Toulouse have been crowned best in Europe on 13 occasions. Whoever contests the final in Marseille in May will have history on their side. That is not to say that the corresponding quartet are simply competing for silver. Montpellier stunned Harlequins in the first leg of their tie, beating the Premiership champions 40-26 in France and then, with what many pundits this side of the Channel considered a weakened team, held off a Marcus Smith-inspired fightback to progress despite their 33-20 defeat at the Stoop. “Do you still think I don’t respect the competition?” asked the Montpellier director of rugby, Philippe Saint-André, after the match in London where Smith missed a decisive conversion late on. “To be honest I expected him to kick the conversion,” said Saint-André, who also honoured his reserve players, underlining the breadth of talent at his disposal. That strength of depth – a consequence of club owners’ deep pockets, but also the JIFF ruling which places a required quota on homegrown talent – allows French teams to fight on multiple fronts. There are four Top 14 sides in the last eight and there will be at least one in the semi-finals with Montpellier travelling to La Rochelle, where they won 29-23 in January. Racing 92’s home game against Sale completes the set. Sale reached this stage last year where they were soundly beaten 45-21 by La Rochelle on the Bay of Biscay. They have never advanced beyond the quarter-finals and will need to be better than they were against a struggling Bristol outfit that was put away only by a 75th-minute Jono Ross try in the second leg. Racing will be no pushovers having thumped Stade Français 55-31 across two matches. Sixth in France, they boast six members of France’s grand slam-winning squad in their ranks. Context is the lifeblood of any sporting competition at the elite level. Given the quality of the remaining clubs, the captain who holds aloft the trophy in May will be able to state that his is the best team in Europe.",Sport/Sport,Champions Cup fulfils promise and serves up tasty quarter-final menu,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/17/champions-cup-fulfils-promise-and-serves-up-tasty-quarter-final-menu
4/18/2022,"Whoever ends up buying Chelsea will know they could save themselves a lot of money by investing in the club’s thriving academy. It is the gift that keeps on giving and while there will always be a place for expensive foreign signings there is no reason for Thomas Tuchel to stop trusting in the kids. Academy products were crucial to Chelsea reaching their third successive FA Cup final, where they will face Liverpool next month. Victory over a toothless Crystal Palace was secured by Mason Mount and this was also a huge moment in the career of Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who opened this game up by scoring the breakthrough goal midway through the second half. Loftus-Cheek is a player who is yet to fulfil his vast potential. There have been disappointing loans, a series of cruel injuries and times when it has seemed his future lies away from Chelsea. Crucially, though, the midfielder still retains Tuchel’s support. Chelsea’s manager is pushing Loftus-Cheek, whose goal came with Gareth Southgate watching on from the stands, and he will want more if the 26-year-old is to earn a place in his squad once new owners arrive. It was bewildering to think that Chelsea’s previous appearance at Wembley had come less than 24 hours after Roman Abramovich announced his fanciful plan to hand control of the club to its trustees. So much has happened since that February afternoon, which ended with Kepa Arrizabalaga’s wayward penalty giving the Carabao Cup to Liverpool, and there is still no way of knowing what comes next in this strangest of takeover sagas. Todd Boehly’s consortium? Lord Coe and Sir Martin Broughton’s group? Or will it be Stephen Pagliuca, recently seen assuring Atalanta fans of his commitment to their club, who finds himself holding the keys to Stamford Bridge? Whatever the answer the only thing that feels certain at the moment is that Chelsea must trust in Tuchel. The German has been a voice of calm throughout the last few weeks and has now guided Chelsea into six major finals. The noise and colour had come from Palace fans at first. Red and blue smoke billowed from their end at the start and they liked what they saw from their improving young side during the first half. Palace scrapped for possession and were quick to push on the break, Andreas Christensen forced to step in early on when Jean-Phillipe Mateta threatened to break through. But the opening period was tight and cagey. Unable to select Conor Gallgher against his parent club under the terms of the midfielder’s loan, Patrick Vieira decided to use a back three for the first time this season. The intention was to squeeze the space and it made for a dull spectacle, with Wilfried Zaha unable to shake off Reece James and Eberechi Eze offering little as Gallagher’s replacement. As for Chelsea, they looked drained after their heroic effort against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu. There were only three changes from Tuchel, who brought Christensen, Jorginho and César Azpilicueta in for Thiago Silva, N’Golo Kanté and Loftus-Cheek, and his side struggled to build any momentum at first. Palace were not giving anything away. Azpilicueta wasted Chelsea’s clearest opening, shanking a volley wide when it seemed easier to bring the ball down. Crosses were headed away and too many ponderous moves broke down. Only when Timo Werner ran down the left and beyond a few Palace defenders after 38 minutes did the temperature rise Kai Havertz spoiled the mood by faking contact from Marc Guéhi, prompting Anthony Taylor to book the German for diving. Palace went closest during the first half. A free-kick was headed to Cheikhou Kouyaté and his fierce low shot drew an outstanding save from Édouard Mendy. Tuchel had reason to feel concerned. Chelsea, who had to replace Mateo Kovacic with Loftus-Cheek midway through the opening period, needed more intensity after the break. They pushed Palace back and were close to going ahead when Werner ran through on goal, forcing Jack Butland to make a smothering save. Vieira was concerned. He withdrew Mateta for Andre Ayew in a bid to improve his side’s attack, but it had no effect. Chelsea had taken control and it was not a surprise when they took the lead after winning the ball back deep in Palace’s half. Havertz dribbled down the right and when his cross hit Guéhi the ball fell invitingly for Loftus-Cheek, who had time and space to send a rising shot past Butland thanks to a slight touch off Joachim Andersen. There was no way back for Palace, who responded by introducing Michael Olise and Christian Benteke. They could not touch Chelsea’s defence and their dream was over with 15 minutes left. Werner’s pass from the left was nice and Mount’s first touch was even better. The midfielder was too quick for Palace’s faltering defence and his lovely, cool finish into Butland’s bottom-left corner ensured that Chelsea will be back at Wembley to face Liverpool.",Sport/Football,Chelsea break Crystal Palace hearts to secure FA Cup final clash with Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/17/chelsea-crystal-palace-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report
4/18/2022,"Port Adelaide simply had to win yesterday. Lose, and it was curtains for season 2022. The task before them was enormous. The Blues have an abundance of talent and play the MCG very well indeed. They were smarting after dropping a game to Gold Coast. And they were desperate to get one back on Port, after their Adelaide Oval humiliation last year. That was the day David Teague’s papers were stamped. There were plenty of Port players in downhill mode – slaloming into easy goals, dishing out the lip. Michael Voss, who was wearing a Port polo top that day, would have reminded his new charges about it. In 2022, nothing has gone right for Port Adelaide. Charlie Dixon, who cops a lot of flak but who is so important to them structurally, hurt his ankle at training and is still weeks away from returning. Aliir Aliir, the All-Australian centre half-back, wrecked his ankle in the opening round. Ollie Wines last week suffered an atrial fibrillation, which afflicts the elderly and the super fit. Scott Lycett dislocated his shoulder and will be out for three months. Not surprisingly, the results have followed suit. They were systematically dismantled by Hawthorn. They somehow found a way to lose the Showdown. Against Melbourne, they spent the night bombing to a non-existent forward line, right into the arms of the best organised defence in football. Yesterday’s game seemed done and dusted halfway through the opening term. The visitors were being decimated in centre clearances. Sam Walsh ran riot, helping himself to 16 first term possessions. At one point, Carlton stretched the lead to 50 points. Missing a ruckman, a full forward and a Brownlow medallist, Port simply did not have the cattle. But then something extraordinary happened. Port started playing like men possessed. Five times in a row, they punished Carlton on the turnover. They suddenly had all the momentum, and all the run. Much like they were a fortnight earlier, the Blues were dead on their feet. In the end, as ridiculous as it sounds, Port should have won. Gray and Motlop twice squandered easy chances. They were bold and brave. But they blew it. For years, Port have been a pretty straightforward side that’s always been missing something – a bit of luck, some poise, a star forward or a coach who could pull a rabbit out of the hat. They have always had a tendency to shoot themselves in the foot. And they have never really been a ‘system’ team. When the game is played at breakneck speed, when their young high draft picks are fully switched on, and when that home crowd of theirs is humming, they are quite a sight. But when that intensity wanes - as it always will at some point – they look ordinary. It was never more evident than preliminary final night last year. And it was glaringly obvious in the opening half yesterday. On preliminary final night, Ken Hinkley’s boys were as passive as you will ever see a top-four side. More than any other performance on his watch, it would have stuck in his craw. For most of the night, he resembled a man stuck on a long-haul flight wedged between David Koch and the Sunrise Cash Cow. There really was not much he could do. Yesterday, they could have once again curled up their toes. Instead, they dug in. It was admirable. But it counted for nought. The pressure of coaching in Adelaide has driven some good men out of the game. Brenton Sanderson spoke recently about the all-encompassing nature of it, and how it nearly broke him. Don Pyke expressed similar sentiments. The South Australian football environment is pitiless. It has never been renowned for embracing Victorians. For weeks, angry talkback callers have wanted Hinkley’s head on a spit. Hinkley was sanguine in the post-match, and certainly does not present as a man who lets that sort of stuff get to him. As a player, he was typical of the Geelong sides of that era. He took risks, kept it simple, was a delight to watch, but always fell short at the final hurdle. As a coach, he is as honest as the day is long. His record over the past decade, given the talent at his disposal, is remarkable. And he is an old school players’ coach. He refers to them as ‘my sons’. Even Kane Cornes, who is constitutionally required to find fault with everyone and everything, speaks of his former coach with great fondness. But right now, Hinkley is at the mercy of a hysterical local media, a supporter base that does not tolerate mediocrity and a president whose primary focus is breakfast television. The heat will come for him now. In the Port change rooms, there is a sign: “We will never, ever give up”. But as far as 2022 is concerned, we can categorically rule a line through them. “In my first season we won five in a row, then lost five in a row,” Hinkley said yesterday. “My history tells me you can still lose five in a row and make finals.” Indeed, Sydney were 0-6 a few years back, and still salvaged their season. But the Swans had Lance Franklin. Port have Jeremy Finlayson. They have a mounting injury list. They have a long winter ahead of them.",Sport/Sport,"Port Adelaide are bold and brave, but also as ordinary as the AFL winter is long | Jonathan Horn",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/18/port-adelaide-are-bold-and-brave-but-also-as-ordinary-as-the-afl-winter-is-long
4/18/2022,"“On reflection, it was something he cared passionately about.” This was the absurd explanation from a Downing Street spokesperson of the prime minister’s partial U-turn on scrapping a ban on conversion practices. The outcry at dropping the promised legislation prompted him to restore it, but it will now be limited to sexual orientation. Transgender conversion practices will not be included. Boris Johnson’s convictions have always been largely a matter of convenience. But the abhorrence most people feel towards conversion practices is deeply rooted. And it is most; in a YouGov poll, more than 62% of voters wanted the banning of these practices targeting both sexuality and gender identity. People recognise that conversion “therapy” is no such thing: this is about shaming and suppression. Sometimes families force it upon individuals. In other cases, they may seek it out under pressure, or because they have been made to feel that there is something “wrong” with them. At the extreme, these practices may extend to verbal and physical abuse. More often, government research finds, they mean attempting to “pray the gay away”, or talking therapies. Either way, they seek to extinguish a person’s understanding of who they are, and increase stigma. The research notes growing evidence that such practices are statistically associated with poor mental health outcomes, including suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. Canada, France, Brazil, New Zealand and Argentina have already banned conversion practices for transgender people. The government says that “the complexity of issues and need for further careful thought” means “separate work” is necessary. Some gender-critical feminists say that including transgender people will prevent those with gender dysphoria from exploring their identity and risks criminalising parents and therapists for anything other than a gender-affirming approach. They, along with the Equality and Human Rights Commission, believe that the Cass review of NHS England’s gender identity service for children and young people should be completed first. But conversion practices can be distinguished by the fact that those who carry them out see only one acceptable outcome. The British government’s consultation stressed that legislation would be symmetrical, covering therapies that aim to change a person “to or from being transgender”, and that the aim was to ensure that young people were “supported in exploring their identity without being encouraged towards one particular path”. Health, counselling and psychotherapy organisations including the British Medical Association, NHS England, Scotland and Wales, and the Royal College of General Practitioners have stated that a ban would not rule out appropriate clinical interventions for transgender people or those questioning their gender. Not only is it possible to specify that exploratory work can continue – other countries have done so. Canada’s law notes that its ban “does not include a practice, treatment or service that relates to the exploration or development of an integrated personal identity … and that is not based on an assumption that a particular sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression is to be preferred over another”. Such assurances could set some minds at rest. They are unlikely to sway the prime minister, because his concerns lie elsewhere. Government sources have reportedly said that they see the issue as a trap for Labour; transgender rights now appear to be part of No 10’s “war on woke”. But a wedge issue is meant to split support for one’s opponents. Mr Johnson’s decision is out of step with even his own party. Conservative MPs have been outspoken in their condemnation, and about 50 could back a move to make the ban comprehensive, while 58% of Tory voters think all forms of “conversion therapy” should be outlawed. They believe that transgender people too need and deserve protection from these practices. They are right.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on banning 'conversion therapy': protect everyone | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/17/the-guardian-view-on-banning-conversion-therapy-protect-everyone
