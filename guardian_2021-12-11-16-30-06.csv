12/11/2021,"There’s much to be said for idle thoughts in the right minds, and Jan Morris was particularly good at giving whimsy free rein. A writer of places and their people, she didn’t much care for the label “travel writer”, presumably because of its trivial and transactional connotations, and I doubt she would have been so grandiose as to style herself an “adventurer”. This book of brief essays, written in the last decade or so of her life and always designed to be published posthumously – “by the time you read it I shall be gone!” she writes cheerfully in her “pre-mortem” introduction – is filled with whimsy and, aside from decidedly light musings on matters such as sneezing, marmalade and hot-water bottles, she proves that being fanciful is not the enemy of seriousness. Take her jeu d’esprit in the matter of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, that “burr in the heart of the monarchy, lovely but sly”. In Morris’s view, her death was marked in precisely, diametrically, the wrong way: “The nation mourned a martyr when it should have been celebrating a miscreant.” It would have been far better, the writer suggests, had Britain embraced her true nature while she was alive, given her the royal yacht Britannia, repainted it in bright colours and instructed her to tour the world’s ports, spreading glamour and cheer on behalf of the nation. Imagine, Morris asks us, Diana and hunky entourage arriving at some dusty and remote Mediterranean island at dawn, blasting rock’n’roll by way of reveille, and leading its bemused and bewitched inhabitants in a merry dance around the harbour until wine flows from the fountains and flowers rain down on the streets. It is, if nothing else, a rather more enticing vision of noblesse oblige than those to which we have become wearily accustomed.  But Morris’s penchant for allegories means that her essays are rarely “nothing else”. Threaded through these pieces is a “dedication to the proposition that nothing is only what it seems”, and a recurring fascination with applying that principle to weighty topics that range from the difference between nations and nation states, patriotism and nationalism, the contrasts between the conception and the execution of the feminist project, the subtle changes that mark the transition between countries and cultures, the past and the present. Prompted by a graffito in Trieste – a city of complex origins and identity about which Morris wrote a whole book – the writer ponders her response to its exhortation to “FUK NATIONS”, a sentiment that she grants the status of not only “considered historical opinion” but one with which she sympathises. “I dislike the word ‘nationalist’. I dislike the ungenerous, niggling, mean sound of it. In my mind it goes with wars and squabbles and prejudices and old historic quarrels best forgotten. But I am sick to death of nationality, too, and think it is a dying concept anyway. The earth is becoming just too small for political nationalities. To my mind they will one day seem as absurdly primitive as dynastic wars, or the divine right of kings.” What Morris does believe in is attachment; that a commitment to an idea, whether emotional or intellectual, is itself an inalienable form of belonging. Her elaboration of that argument in terms of patriotism – including her own proud Welshness – is both stirring and moving: “I like to imagine a world,” she writes, “in which the things that are rightly Caesar’s, like war and foreign policy and higher economics, are left to Caesar, at the centre of things; but the things that are rightly God’s, the way we think, and behave, and talk, and believe, and organise our private lives, are left to the nations.” And there is a rousing sting in the tail: “As for the Nation-States, which have done so much evil in their time, and bring out the worst in us still, fuck ’em all.” Among the several pleasures of Allegorizings are its shifts in tone and mood; alongside ideological and philosophical argument come Morris’s self-conscious indulgence of her own idiosyncrasies, and her airing of private passions (see the above marmalade, which sparks a revelation that Morris eats the stuff with apples when she is being austere, and sausages when seeking hedonism). She is, on occasion, like a faintly ironised Charles Pooter, wondering where England’s glories have been hidden as she takes a train through the industrial heartlands of the Midlands, reflecting that those glories “were almost beyond my imagination, indeed, as I masticated the Penn State Sour Cream and Chive-Flavoured Pretzels with which Virgin Rail sustains its first-class passengers”. Naturally, given that Morris wrote these pieces towards the end of her life – she died in November last year, at the age of 94 – there is a fair amount about the challenges of ageing; the time when you might begin to keep a note of the best cities, in terms of helpful bystanders, in which to fall over. Her account of a cruise holiday is wonderfully delicate, seeing her move from a mild and comical suspicion of her fellow travellers to a whole-hearted admiration for their determination to extract maximum pleasure from their surroundings, even in the face of limitations. She begins the voyage by christening the ship the Geriatrica, but ends by renaming it the SS Indomitable, bookending her story with a woman who quotes Groucho Marx to her at the beginning of the holiday but gets it wrong: “‘It goes like this,’ said she. ‘Next to a dog, a book is a man’s best friend, but inside it’s too dark to read anyway. Isn’t that hilarious? I just love it.’” Morris is non-plussed. On the final day aboard, she pops up again, having worked out her mistake: “‘I knew I’d got that Groucho story wrong. I’ve been thinking about it all this time, and this is how it should go: Outside of a dog, a book is a man’s best friend, but inside it’s too dark to read anyway.”’ “This time I really did laugh,” writes Morris. “I marvelled that throughout our voyage, in museum, taverna and Seafarers’ Lounge, she had been assiduously worrying out that joke; and even as she spoke my eyes strayed to the Sunshine Promenade above her head, where the passengers were seizing their last chance of seaboard exercise around the measured mile.” Really significant writers are made so by the quality of their noticing, their attention to what happens both when they are there and when they are not. Allegorizings might be an addendum to a life that brought us so much of this kind of significant work, but it’s a welcome and delightful one.

12/11/2021,"It’s been more than two weeks since Kevin Strickland was released from the Western Missouri correctional center and now he often wakes at 3.30am, long before the dawn, with an urge to get outside. For 43 years of a sentence under a former Missouri law known as the “Hard 50” – which required Strickland to serve at least 50 years before he would be eligible for parole – that was an impossibility.  But on 23 November, Strickland, 62, was discharged from the state’s custody, ending his incarceration for a 1978 triple murder he always maintained – and local prosecutors and Kansas City officials now agree – he did not commit. Now he’s waking at his brother’s place. “I’m waking up anxious to get outside,” Strickland told the Guardian at his lawyer’s 38th floor office in Kansas City, the Great Plains out spread out across the arc of the windows. “I want to know and feel light. Three o’clock in the morning, I’m ready. Time to go. I don’t know where I’m going but I know it’s time to go.” In the moment that Strickland walked free, he was Missouri’s longest serving inmate. His conviction for the murders of Sherrie Black, 22, Larry Ingram, 21, and John Walker, 20, during a home invasion largely rested on the eyewitness testimony of the sole survivor of the crime, Cynthia Douglas. Douglas recanted her testimony in 2009, saying she had been pressured by prosecutors to identify Strickland, a Black man who was then 18 years old. But until his case was taken up by the Midwest Innocence Project, which was joined in an effort to overturn his conviction by Jackson county prosecutor Jean Peters Baker, there was little Strickland could do. “You can’t even imagine – and you don’t want to,” Strickland says of his incarceration. “It’s tough to be told when to do things every day. When to lay down. Eat. Sleep. Play. And to know those things are going to repeat day after day after day so long as you keep living – and that it’s not going to change.” “You’ve just got to go through it. It’s dark. I didn’t check out. You have to face it. Deal with it. I’ve seen several suicides, so that would be an indication their will and strength had been compromised.” Strickland, who is confined to a wheelchair until his spinal stenosis is treated, has become in many ways an example of criminal justice inequities, and not just in the circumstances of his conviction – no physical evidence tied him to the crime scene; an all-white jury came back after two hours, though he recalls 15 or 30 minutes. “They sure didn’t waste any time,” he says. His case has also drawn attention to a Missouri law that denies restitution unless an exoneration results solely from DNA profiling analysis. Last week, state representative Mark Sharp filed a bill to change the state’s restitution law to include people found innocent as the result of an evidentiary method. The proposal would allow eligible people to receive as much as $100 aday for every day they spent incarcerated after conviction, or $36,500 a year. In Strickland’s case that would be about $1,569,500 – just short of the $1,734,370 raised by the Innocence Project’s GoFundMe page. In Kansas City last week, many said they had repeatedly donated small amounts to the fund, a gesture that could be interpreted as a show of sympathy and popular resistance to injustice. But not all are on board with Strickland’s release, which followed a law passed in April that gave Baker, the county prosecutor, the right to ask the court to vacate Strickland’s guilty verdict. Missouri’s fiercely conservative attorney general, Eric Schmitt, battled to uphold Strickland’s conviction, delayed his hearing and attempted to block his release with a series of motions, each rejected by retired Missouri appeals court judge James Walsh. “I’d always felt the attorney general’s office was going to oppose everything,” Strickland says. “They’d oppose the change of the day from Monday to Tuesday. It’s what they do.” Missouri governor Mike Parson also rebuffed appeals to pardon him, arguing that it was not a “priority”, even as he pardoned Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the Missouri couple who confronted racial justice protesters with guns last year. But Strickland is now a hero to many. Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas invited him to switch on the Christmas lights on a 100-foot-tall fir tree; Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said he hoped Strickland’s release “can be a thing that doesn’t let people get in that same situation that he was in and lose a big part of their life”. Strickland says he’s not angered by four decades of incarceration. Anger is a luxury for others, he says, but one that he does not have an inclination to indulge. “I can’t waste energy in anger, so I don’t get angry, because anger sometimes make you get physical. Anger is a strong word and it brings on negativity. I’m just disgusted and disappointed about what has happened to me.” As in other recent wrongful conviction releases, including Anthony Broadwater, who served 16 years after being misidentified by author Alice Sebold as the perpetrator of her rape, the question of restitution is a question that keeps surfacing. Having been imprisoned for his entire adult life, Strickland has no savings or ability to show work history for social security entitlements. He plans to use the funds that have been raised “wisely, not wastefully. No partying. There won’t be none of that.” “I’m truly grateful, and I’m not just saying that because it’s the politically correct thing to say. I need it, and I didn’t know there was so many caring people out there.” But the attention he’s getting is unfamiliar. “I can’t say I enjoy it. Big groups are too much, and I don’t like people constantly rolling up me. But you got to take the bitter with the sweet.” His plan is to find a quiet, safe place to live, away from most people, and to try to appreciate the days he has “moving forward”. “I’m going to eat what I want to eat, do a little swimming, and just try to enjoy the remainder of my life.” He might like to live in the country. “I’m a country boy at heart,” he says. “Some people have a problem with squirrel and rabbit. But I’m good with them. I’ll eat some raccoon, deer, wild turkey, snake. And I want to try ‘gator.” But his real ambition is to go fishing. “I’d fish anywhere you told me I could fish. When I fish, I’m not fishing for sport, I fish to eat. That guy Jeremy [Wade, host of TV show River Monsters] – I’d like to go out fishing with him. He knows what he’s doing.” During his incarceration, Strickland was once in contact with Cynthia Douglas, the woman who identified him as being one of the murderers, when he heard that she was trying to clear up her mistake. “I called her to thank her for what she was trying to do. It was just one time. But I knew what had happened – that she had been pressured into saying it was me. I felt pity for her that she’d had to accuse me. But she was trying to do the right thing, so those feelings went out the window.” Strickland is heartened by the increasing number of exonerees from the criminal justice system. What would make a difference to preventing future wrongful convictions, he believes, is to have a public defender in every precinct before suspects are pulled into a lineup. “The justice system doesn’t have to change,” Strickland says. “It has to be re-booted from the ground up. The police are relying on civilians to call in tips. They need to find detectives who want to do their jobs, and not rely on civilians to tell them which way to go.” Being released from long-term incarceration is not simple – mastering a cellphone, for instance, or getting ID can be tricky. The sight of a clock reminds him of head-count time – 5.30am, 7.30, 11, 4, and 10pm. When he was released, he was met by his friend Ricky Kidd, who was exonerated after 23 years and released from Western Missouri correctional. Kidd’s counsel was to take it slow, take time to acclimate, don’t do anything on anybody’s time but your own. “You can’t catch those 43 years,” Strickland says. “Can’t get them back. They’re gone. Never can. So I need to fix that in my mind and slow down.”",News/US news,‘You can’t catch those 43 years’: exonerated former prisoner tries to start life anew,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/11/kevin-strickland-exonerated-former-prisoner-start-life-anew

12/11/2021,"Claims companies and law firms looking for the next bonanza in payouts are targeting people who have been the victim of a data breach, with some telling those affected they could be entitled to thousands of pounds in compensation. A Google search for the term “data breach claim” results in a long list of firms – the vast majority of them no-win, no-fee solicitors – and there are more moving into this space all the time. Meanwhile, adverts for firms are increasingly appearing in Instagram feeds.  The proliferation of companies operating in this area has prompted speculation that this could be the industry’s next “golden goose” after the payment protection insurance scandal, and could lead to a new deluge of spam text messages and unwanted cold calls. What is fuelling this growing market is the fact that the UK’s data watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), can’t award compensation to people if they have been affected by a data breach, even when the law has been broken. As an individual, your options include pursuing the company yourself – either by appealing to it for compensation or taking it to the small claims court – or turning to one of these firms, which could launch a group action if there are enough people with a claim against the same company. One advantage of using one of these firms is that, assuming they take you on, they will typically do a lot of the legwork for you. Also, because most are no-win, no-fee, you often won’t have to pay anything upfront or if the claim fails. The big downside is that, generally speaking, you can expect to hand over a quarter of your compensation to the firm as its fee if your claim is successful. An industry insider told Guardian Money that “25% is the standard”. The ICO defines a personal data breach as an incident that leads to “the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data”. It could be something that affects only one person or many. Over the last few years there have been a string of high-profile data breaches, many involving big companies such as British Airways, the hotels company Marriott, Ticketmaster and TalkTalk. Some have been linked to cyber-attacks, and others related to information being lost or shared with the wrong people. There have also been a number of incidents involving government departments or similar. Only days ago an NHS trust apologised after sharing the email addresses of people taking part in a Covid vaccine trial. Last month it emerged that Labour had been hit by a “cyber incident” affecting members’ data. Meanwhile, some people find out they have been the victim of a data breach after submitting a subject access request to a company they are in dispute with. Guardian Money has been told that some utility companies and other firms are still being lax when it comes to customers’ information, and are emailing Excel spreadsheets full of personal data to perhaps dozens of people. The most basic type of personal data is your name and email address. The next level might be your home address and phone number. Most people would probably consider that breaches involving financial data such as credit card and banking information (card numbers, expiry dates and so on), and passwords, fall into the most serious category. There is also what the law describes as “sensitive” information – things such as religious beliefs, health, sexuality, ethnic background and trade union membership. However, the impact of a breach will vary from person to person. For some individuals – a survivor of abuse or domestic violence, a member of the UK Special Forces or an asylum seeker, for example – even only the unauthorised disclosure of their name or email address could have serious repercussions but for others the impact will be minimal. The UK’s Data Protection Act 2018 gives you the right to claim compensation from a company or organisation if you have suffered “damage” as a result of it breaking data protection law, the ICO says. This includes both “material damage” (for example, you have lost money) or “non-material damage” (for example, you have suffered distress). If you have been the victim of financial crime after an incident, such as suffering fraudulent transactions, that may tick one or both boxes. However, you could also argue you have suffered damage if, say, you have had to change your banking details or have seen your credit score take a tumble. “This is a very contentious area right now – it’s definitely an area of claims growth, without a doubt,” says Richard Jones, a director of DSAR.Ai, a software company specialising in subject access requests. There are various claims as to how much people could be in line to receive. One firm says compensation could be in the region of £1,000 for less serious breaches and “up to £10,000 for very serious breaches”. Graham Coffey & Co Solicitors, based in Manchester, is one of the firms advertising a service. Its managing partner Stuart Snape is keen to dispel the idea that a breach of the rules automatically entitles someone to compensation: “There has to be a real anxiety and a real material effect of that breach.” It might be that the effect is minor – for example, if your name and email address is disclosed, perhaps the only consequence is that you receive more spam in your inbox. “But there are varying degrees of that,” Snape says. He adds that if more sensitive data such as credit card or bank details is involved, “that is when the compensation starts to go beyond the £1,000 mark. [That is potentially] more than just a minor nuisance. Your name and email address, while understandably concerning, is more of a minor nuisance.” It is not clear how many people in the UK have received compensation relating to a data breach – there are no published figures, some individuals will have secured ex gratia payments, and settlements will often be confidential. In July it emerged that British Airways had settled a legal claim by some of those affected by its 2018 data breach. Of the 430,000 customers and staff affected, about 244,000 had their names, addresses and payment card details, including the security number on the back, exposed. The settlement related to a group action reportedly involving more than 16,000 people. However, the payout was kept under wraps There have been a few court cases where details of payouts have been made public. In 2016 the high court awarded damages ranging from £2,500 to £12,500 to six asylum seekers for privacy and data protection law breaches after their personal data was accidentally published on the Home Office website. In the case of the two who were each awarded £12,500, “the effects have been serious”, leaving them fearing for their safety, the judge said. There are thought to be several group actions brewing against Ticketmaster, which was fined £1.25m by the ICO in November 2020 after a breach that included names, payment card numbers, expiry dates and security codes. It potentially affected 1.5 million people in the UK, and investigators found that 60,000 payment cards belonging to Barclays customers had been subjected to known fraud. Another 6,000 cards were replaced by Monzo after it suspected their fraudulent use. Probably your best chance of receiving compensation is if you are a customer of a company that is publicly punished by the ICO and so can’t argue that it did not do anything wrong. Handily for consumers and claims firms, companies can’t hide their failings: under the law, all organisations are required to report personal data breaches to the relevant authority within a certain period. If you are thinking about using a claims firm go for one that is regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (look out for the SRA clickable logo being displayed on a firm’s website). Also, check online reviews for the firm and whether it is acting for other people affected by the same incident.",Lifestyle/Money,The new PPI?

12/11/2021,"It once hoped to make banks a thing of the past by cutting them out of the equation, but now Zopa is shutting down its “peer-to-peer” (P2P) lending arm after 16 years – so it can concentrate on being a bank. The company has contacted its 60,000 existing P2P investors to let them know that it will be handing them back their money – leaving them to find a new home for their cash at a time of ultra-low savings rates.  P2P platforms bypass the banks by linking savers looking for a better return with individuals or small businesses looking for loans. Until recently, billions of pounds were tied up with Zopa and its competitors. However, the coronavirus crisis and increased scrutiny from regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority – which has dubbed P2P a “high-risk investment” – have caused huge turmoil for the industry and led to some players quitting the market. When it launched in 2005, Zopa (it stands for “zone of possible agreement”) was hailed as a radical online financial “exchange” allowing millions of ordinary people to borrow from and lend money to each other. Its aim was to leave “faceless corporations” out in the cold, claiming it could offer consumers better rates of interest than they could get from banks. But in recent years, with some of the shine coming off the P2P sector after the collapse of some smaller players, Zopa has adapted its business model to embrace what it initially stood against. It was granted a full UK banking licence in June 2020 and now offers products such as credit cards, personal loans, fixed-rate savings accounts and car finance. Zopa is closing the P2P side of the business with immediate effect and will be buying its investors’ loans at their current face value, without any of the fees that they would normally incur for a loan sale. This means they will receive back the money they have invested with the site, plus any interest that borrowers have paid up to the date of sale. Everyone should get their money back by 31 January 2022. All of the loans are being bought at face value, including those currently in arrears. There will be no impact on borrowers as Zopa’s banking arm already services them. The company told customers: “Sadly, over the last few years, customer trust in P2P investing has been damaged by a small number of businesses whose approach led to material losses for customers investing in those platforms. Linked to this, the changing regulation in the sector has made it challenging to grow and remain commercially viable.” For some investors, Zopa has been a key part of their portfolio. The company says that since launch, the average return has been 5%, and that even during the pandemic it was able to deliver an average of 3.9%. That compares with the 1.37% to 1.75% it was this week offering those who put their cash into its fixed-rate savings accounts, which involve tying up your money for between one and five years. Those who want to stick with peer-to-peer will find that there are limited options. RateSetter, formerly the UK’s biggest P2P site, shut down the investment side of its business in April, while the other former big player, Funding Circle, now concentrates on small business loans. However, there are still a number of platforms open for business. One of the better-known players is Lending Works, which was this week saying people could earn projected returns of up to 4.5%. Some P2P sites – in many cases ones that most people will not have heard of – are offering up to 12%. These include the P2P property loans platform Blend.",Lifestyle/Money,Zopa exits peer-to-peer lending to focus on banking,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/11/zopa-peer-to-peer-lending-p2p-money
12/11/2021,"Constitutional scholars in the US said a litany of rights, from same-sex marriage and sex to birth control and in vitro fertilization, could come into question if the country’s highest court moves to overrule or weaken Roe v Wade. The supreme court last week heard arguments in the case Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which centers on whether the state of Mississippi can ban abortion at 15 weeks gestation, roughly nine weeks before bans are permitted under current law.  The Mississippi case is widely regarded as the most important abortion rights case since Roe v Wade, when the supreme court effectively legalized abortion nationally in 1973. A decision in the Dobbs case is expected June 2022. Although supreme court opinions are notoriously difficult to predict, a majority of justices on the conservative-leaning court appeared inclined to severely curtail or overturn Roe v Wade, which protects abortion rights in states hostile to the procedure. Legal scholars warned that the impacts of such a move would likely be widespread, because abortion rights are rooted in the same implied constitutional right to privacy that is the foundation for other intimate personal decisions Americans now take for granted. Gay rights, contraceptives, certain fertility treatments and even interracial marriage, “are imperiled because they’re all rooted in that right to privacy,” Melissa Murray, a law professor at New York University law school and an expert in constitutional, family and reproductive rights law, told the Guardian. “All of this has been implied because they’re understood to be core, basic human rights,” said Murray. “You don’t need the state to recognize them because they are vested in you by virtue of being a human.” Currently, states are prevented from banning abortions before a fetus can survive outside the womb, a concept known as “viability”. But at the hearing on 1 December, a majority of justices appeared ready to uphold Mississippi’s law, which would require either invalidating the “viability” standard or overturn Roe v Wade entirely. In arguments, justices pointed to several ways they may reinterpret the Roe v Wade decision. Some, such as Justice Clarence Thomas, were skeptical there is a right to privacy and were swayed by the lack of an explicit reference to the right in the constitution, a concept known as “textualism”. “If we were talking about the second amendment, I know exactly what we’re talking about,” said Thomas. “If we’re talking about the fourth amendment, I know what we’re talking about because it’s written. It’s there.” That argument could be paired with one pushed forward by conservatives, such as Mississippi solicitor general Scott Stewart, who argued a right to abortion is not grounded in the “history or tradition” of the country. “A right to abortion [is] not grounded in the text,” said Stewart. “It’s grounded on abstract concepts that this court has rejected in other contexts as supplying a substantive right”. The theory underlying that right to privacy is called “substantive due process”, or the doctrine that the constitution protects both the procedures of due process, such as how criminal law is applied, and “substantive” guarantees of life, liberty and property. “If you ask where rights come from in the US constitution there’s basically two general answers,” said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and a historian who has studied abortion rights since Roe v Wade. “There’s the rights spelled out in the text of the constitution,” such as rights to bear arms or against unreasonable search and seizure, “and there’s other rights, like the right to marry and the right to parent that are not in the text of the constitution”. Those are rights established by substantive due process. For example, in 1965 the court struck down birth control bans for married couples in Griswold v Connecticut. In 1967 with Loving v Virginia, the court invalidated anti-miscegenation laws that barred interracial marriage. In 1972 in Eisenstadt v Baird, the court found people who were not married also had a right to birth control. In 1973, the court recognized a right to terminate a pregnancy. “These rights of parental autonomy are underpinnings of the right to privacy, marriage is included in this,” said Murray. “In a later case, the state says marriage [and] procreation are basic civil rights of man.” Cases based in substantive due process continued into the modern era, when in 2003 the court invalidated anti-sodomy statutes in Lawrence v Texas, and established a right to same-sex conduct. In 2016, the court found same-sex couples also had a right to marry in Obergefell v Hodges. Attorneys for Jackson Women’s Health Organization responded on the principle of substantive due process when quizzed on this principle by Thomas. “If I were to ask you what constitutional right protects the right to abortion, is it privacy? Is it autonomy? What would it be?” asked Thomas. “It’s liberty, Your Honor,” said Julie Rikelman, litigation director for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represented the abortion clinic. Briefs to the court in Dobbs directly challenge that principle, such as from the conservative, anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life. Attorneys for the group, the conservative legal activists Adam Mortara and Jonathan Mitchell, argued the court does not necessarily need to overturn decisions protecting gay rights. “But neither should the court hesitate to write an opinion that leaves those decisions hanging by a thread,” wrote Mortara and Mitchell. “Lawrence and Obergefell, while far less hazardous to human life, are as lawless as Roe.” The same brief argued women could control their reproduction by refraining from sex. Neither Mitchell nor Mortara responded to an interview request. Until the supreme court issues a decision, it is unclear exactly how rights protected by substantive due process might be affected. However, scholars consider same-sex and reproductive rights to be the most vulnerable because there is an active political campaign to circumscribe them. By contrast, there is little contemporary criticism of interracial marriage. If Roe v Wade is overruled, “It will be on the ground it was a right that was untethered from constitutional text,” said Murray. If that view prevails on the court, rights to contraception, gay rights and in vitro fertilization could also be quickly implicated, since, “all of these things are untethered from constitutional text and historically were not available in the US”. What’s more, the history of abortion rights may provide a roadmap for other rights to be hobbled, even if substantive due process prevails. Murray offered the example of a 2017 case, in which three conservative justices, led by justice Neil Gorsuch, argued states could restrict birth certificates of same-sex parents. Gorsuch argued there appeared to be nothing unconstitutional about a “biology-based birth registration regime” where only one same-sex parent would be listed on the certificate. “It is a really good example of how they have dismantled Roe piecemeal and incrementally could be applied to these other rights,” said Murray.",News/US news,"How dismantling Roe v Wade could imperil other ‘core, basic human rights’",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/11/supreme-court-roe-v-wade-gay-rights-contraceptives-fertility-treatments
12/11/2021,"The £800 Townhouse dining table is an “elegant, sturdy classic” built for gathering round. Marsha Moore’s £20 melamine camping table, with a surface area of less than a square metre, is not, and certainly not where she imagined eating Christmas dinner. But Moore, a writer who recently moved into an unfurnished flat in London with her husband and son, is one of many Britons trapped in a furniture nightmare before Christmas after deliveries of key pieces such as sofas, tables and beds were delayed by supply chain disruption.  “We have been eating at camping tables since we moved in in early November,” says Moore, who selected products, including a sofa, with the shortest wait time after being advised that orders could take up to 25 weeks. After her dining table’s arrival was bumped to 2022 she headed to Decathlon for a second substitute surface. “Now we’ve got two of them pushed together and some folding chairs we got from Argos … we will be eating Christmas dinner on our camping tables.” Her family is not alone. Social media is full of tales of furniture woe and pictures of empty rooms as, even after long waits, new purchases fail to materialise, with one longsuffering shopper even giving it a name: the “Great Furniture Delay” of 2021. This week, the online furniture retailer Made.com warned that up to £45m-worth of orders were delayed, with the newly listed company blaming its profit warning on factory shutdowns in Vietnam, clogged ports and extended shipping times. It follows last month’s gloomy update from Ikea. The furniture giant says it is struggling to keep shelves in its stores and warehouses stocked with more supply chain disruption and higher prices on the cards for 2022. Shoppers looking to make rare big ticket purchases are surprised by how long they now have to wait for furniture pieces tailored to their taste. In John Lewis the average wait is 16 weeks for a sofa while some upholstered beds take 20 weeks. The pandemic has turned the once steady furniture market into a rollercoaster ride. Britons typically spend around £14bn a year kitting out their homes but last year’s lockdowns wiped £1.3bn off UK furniture sales, according to Retail Economics. Demand has see-sawed back with sales on track to hit £14bn again this year. In Ian and Eilidh’s Glasgow flat a pair of lonely-looking camping chairs are stationed in front of the television rather than the muddy Glastonbury field they were bought for. The festival, like their sofa, fell foul of the pandemic. Ian thinks his L-shaped sofa is on a “container ship somewhere”. As first-time buyers on a budget, it is with some irony that Ian reports they “chose something that would fill the room”. “The sofa had an estimated delivery time of eight to 10 weeks so we optimistically thought it might arrive shortly after we moved into the flat in late August. “It’s now December and we are still sofa-less.” The PhD student is “not a camper by nature” and with no end in sight to their sofa odyssey bemoans not being able to have anyone over at Christmas “because there is nowhere to sit”. Richard Wilding, the professor of supply chain strategy at Cranfield School of Management, says that before the pandemic, global supply chains were like a “well-choreographed ballet”. Then in 2020 demand fell sharply in the initial phase of the pandemic only for it to roar back in 2021. “We talk about black swan events,” he adds. “These were rare events but at the moment we have flocks of black swan events coming at us: in recent months we’ve had ports in China being shut down again; Vietnam has gone into a really big lockdown. “When things look as though they’re getting back to normal in the UK, what you’re suddenly finding is rolling lockdowns are occurring in other regions. As soon as that starts to happen that means that the ballet is once again disrupted, so we’re getting disruption after disruption.” Production and transport delays are putting a strain on customer service, with DFS, the UK’s biggest sofa chain, coming under fire from disappointed customers. One customer suggests its initials stand for Disappointment, Frustration and Sitting on the floor. A Facebook group devoted to “angry customers” of its Sofology brand has 3,400 members. One horror story comes from Janet Bell who, when she ordered her £2,900 Tallulah sofa and matching footstool from Sofology in May was looking forward to sinking into its “perfectly plump” cushions. But her September delivery bled into November and then calamity struck: her old sofa was collected only for the following day’s delivery of her new couch to then be cancelled, “leaving me and my children with nothing to sit on”. DFS says supply chain disruption has increased the average wait for its sofas from eight to 15 weeks but the “vast majority of customer orders are delivered on time”. “The short-term operational environment continues to be difficult for the furniture industry … Against this backdrop, lead times are being extended and in some instances we are not able to deliver orders within the timeframes we originally scheduled.” In Worcester, Caitlin Wakefield, a charity worker who bought her sofa from a local shop back in August, has her fingers crossed it will finally arrive on her new delivery date, which is just four days before Christmas. “We were happy to wait because we wanted to support a local business coming out of the pandemic,” she says. “I didn’t want to go to a big corporate, like Ikea, where we could probably get the sofa at the weekend. “When we ordered in August they had a massive backlog of orders from people who had changed their homes around in lockdown or moved house. [But] when I called in mid-November to ask ‘is it coming’ they said they were struggling with staff at the factory where it is being made in south Wales.” Although China and Vietnam are important manufacturing hubs a lot of sofas are actually made in the UK. However, British companies are said to be struggling to recruit upholsterers, for example, because of worker shortages linked to Brexit. Thanks to a new wave of retailer all is not lost for households desperate for a sofa to sit on. Companies such as Snug and Swyft sell modular sofas with rapid turnaround times that can be clicked together in different configurations. After three weeks without a sofa Janet Bell, a single mum with two teenage children, banked a refund through PayPal, and took a risk, ordering a sofa online she had not physically tested out. Five days later she was sitting on a cloud. A Snug Cloud Sundae corner sofa to be precise. “It arrived on time and it is fab,” she reports. “I love it, the kids love it, my cats love it.”",News/Business,The Great Furniture Delay: ‘We’ll be eating Christmas dinner on our camping tables’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/11/the-great-furniture-delay-well-be-eating-christmas-dinner-on-our-camping-tables
12/11/2021,"“Hang Mike Pence!” was the chilling chant of the mob at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. Can the same constituency be persuaded to vote Mike Pence on 5 November 2024? He, for one, appears to think so. The former vice-president this week travelled across New Hampshire, host of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary elections, to meet local activists, raise money and deliver a speech attacking potential opponent Joe Biden.  Pence, who has nursed White House ambitions since his teens, has also paid recent visits to the early-voting states Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada, implying that a run is more likely than not. But there is one problem. Donald Trump. The ex-president, whom Pence served faithfully – or obsequiously, in the eyes of critics – has not forgiven him for ignoring his plea to overturn the result of the 2020 election. That Pence, presiding over the Senate at it certified Biden’s victory, had no such power has become irrelevant at this stage. Pence’s continued insistence that he did his constitutional duty on 6 January has done little to assuage the sense of betrayal among livid Trump supporters. In June he was heckled as a “traitor” during a speech to a gathering of religious conservatives in Orlando, Florida – hardly a positive omen. “His biggest challenge is the people that he’s going to need to vote for him – the Republican primary base – are also the people who wanted to hang him on January 6,” said Kurt Bardella, an adviser to the Democratic National Committee. “I don’t see how you overcome that.” Yet the former Indiana governor appears to be playing a long game, perhaps betting that Trump’s influence over the party will wane over the next three years. He may also be calculating that the stand he made for democracy on 6 January – a day on which he refused to flee the Capitol, taking cover in an underground car park – will resonate with moderate Republicans and independents. Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist in Indiana, said: “He’s doing everything he needs to set himself up to run and, if Trump is not the nominee or is not running, I think he’s clearly the frontrunner.” “I think people are realising that he was an unlikely hero on January 6. In the end, even for people who disagree with him for many other policy positions he’s taken, whether it was as a governor or as a vice-president, he did the right thing when the pressure was on on January 6.” Pence’s visit to New Hampshire was his second to the state, which has a huge say in choosing the party nominee, since leaving office. He attended holiday parties, raised money for state Republicans and posed for photos at at the Simply Delicious bakery in Bedford. In a speech hosted by Heritage Action, a conservative policy advocacy organisation, the 62-year-old accused Biden of fuelling inflation and lambasted the president’s social and environmental spending plan, warning: “Keep your hands off the American people’s pay cheques.” As is customary at this stage of an election cycle, Pence did not confirm or deny whether he was running for president, insisting that his priority was next year’s midterm elections for Congress. He told the Associated Press: “To be honest with you, all of my focus is on 2022 because I think we’ve got a historic opportunity for not just a winning election, but a realignment election. So I’m dedicating all of my energy to the process of really winning back the Congress and winning statehouses in 2022. And then in 2023, we’ll look around and we’ll go where we’re called.” The campaign-style tour did not go unnoticed by Trump, who released a statement that said: “Good man, but big mistake on not recognizing the massive voter fraud and irregularities” in the 2020 election. There is no evidence of any such fraud or irregularities. Pence, however, may choose to borrow from the playbook of Glenn Youngkin, who recently won election as governor of Virginia by keeping Trump at arm’s length without overtly denouncing him, thereby reaping the best of both worlds: the party establishment and “Make America Great Again” (Maga) base. There are already signs of Pence having his cake and eating it too. In a radio interview on Wednesday he repeated a now familiar line that he and Trump may “never see eye to eye” on the events of 6 January, but he also told several news outlets “there were irregularities that happened at the state level” in the election. He also insisted that he parted with his boss on good terms. This Trump-lite approach might do just enough to satisfy the former president’s followers while promising other Republicans a lower political temperature. Michael D’Antonio, a Pence biographer, said: “What’s weird is he earned his bona fides with Trump by being so craven in his loyalty and then he expressed his independence in that one moment when it really mattered. So he could make a play in both directions and say, ‘Look, I’m Donald Trump but without the violence.’” There are signs of the Maga core “cooling off” or losing interest in politics, D’Antonio added. “I also knew a number of Trump voters who chose him in 2016 because of Pence. So Pence may have built up a lot of credibility with people. And I guess the last point is, you don’t need to win 50% to get the nomination.” Some Republicans, including former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, have said they will not contest the primaries if Trump throws his hat in the ring. Others, such as ex-New Jersey governor Chris Christie, have rejected the idea that a Trump candidacy should prevent others running. Florida governor Ron DeSantis, South Carolina senator Tim Scott and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo are seen as potential contenders to be party standard bearer. Pence, however, might hope that his status as a former vice-president would count in his favor, just as it did for Biden last year. Clues to his intentions include the fact he is writing a book and recording a regular podcast: in the latest episode of American Freedom, the devout Christian says “we hope and pray” the supreme court will overturn Roe v Wade, its 1973 decision upholding a woman’s constitutional right to abortion. Should he secure the nomination, however, Pence would be hard pushed to win over millions of Trump critics who have not forgotten how he failed to speak out or take a principled stand during four years of chaos. There are countless hours of footage of him giving speeches in which he mentions “President Trump” over and over again, praising his “leadership” and calling him “my friend”. Bardella, a former Republican congressional aide, said: “Mike Pence will be regarded for what he is, which is a coward void of any real moral conviction or principles. “The fact that he is turning around now, still trying to court the hearts and minds and votes of the very people who perpetrated the domestic terrorist attack on our country illustrates that he is the worst kind of political figure because, even though he may not believe these things, he’s still pandering and catering to those elements. I don’t believe that history will look back on him kindly at all.”",News/US news, Pence appears to set up a presidential run – can he win over Trump’s base?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/11/mike-pence-2024-election-donald-trump-republicans
12/11/2021,"Only two months ago, the talk among Tory MPs – echoing some newspaper front pages – was about how Boris Johnson wanted to “go on and on”, lasting longer than Margaret Thatcher’s 11 years in power. At that time, they dismissed the idea that he was a dilettante prime minister who really wanted to retire and write books, give after-dinner speeches on how hard the job was and make loads of money in the process. But that has all changed, with successive scandals over his handling of sleaze allegations and Tory insiders now opening questioning his future.  Backbenchers are not just fuming about Christmas parties and Downing Street refurbishments, but also about the way, in their perception, Johnson has squandered the party’s poll lead and put their seats in danger. All eyes are on the byelection in the formerly safe seat of North Shropshire next week. It would take more than 50 MPs writing a letter of no confidence in Johnson – 15% of the 361 Tory seats in parliament – to trigger a leadership challenge. But an unexpected byelection loss could trigger more submissions to the 1922 Committee, the keeper of the letters. One MP summarises the situation thus: “Are there more than 50 MPs who have submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister? No. Are there more than 50 MPs who think he is doing the job extremely badly? Undoubtedly yes.” Most believe it is a long way off, with no knockout blow to Johnson yet so far, but any leadership challenge would be likely to come from a so-called stalking horse candidate, someone with no hope of winning who does not mind being vilified for being the first to wield the knife. After that, the serious contenders – the cabinet ministers Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss and Sajid Javid, or an outsider such as Tom Tugendhat – could potentially swing into action. Tellingly, all Johnson’s top team have been keen to distance themselves from the No 10 parties stories in recent days. On Friday morning, Truss, the foreign secretary, told the BBC: “Last Christmas, I was spending my time getting trade deals … We were busy working on trade deals.” Supporters of Johnson believe he can turn things around if he can make it through to Christmas with no further major revelations about lockdown-busting antics in Downing Street – but with rumours of other parties abounding, that may be a big if. One former Tory No 10 adviser was pessimistic: “He’s an agent of chaos, and he’s no fucking good at running anything. People are saying he needs to get a grip but that’s not going to happen.” On whether Conservative MPs would make a move against the prime minister, he said: “He got them their seats but he may cost them their seats. If we’re still in this situation in six months’ time I can see him going.” One former minister said they had dismissed stories about letters being submitted but had now begun to take the threat to Johnson seriously. “I’ve had about six emails from constituents. That’s not a flood, but MPs do start to listen when they come in from people who aren’t the usual troublemakers who hate you. Especially if they are personal.” Another MP said their colleagues would probably take some time to think during the Christmas break. “People will start to think: it’s only potentially a year till the next election. I need to think about my leaflets, my fundraising. And does Boris help or hinder? If people decide the latter, then we don’t hang about like Labour do.” Gavin Barwell, a former chief of staff to Theresa May who is now a Tory peer, has also highlighted a trio of issues that he believes have the potential to bring the prime minister down: the Downing Street parties, the flat refurbishment and the anger of backbenchers over a return to Covid restrictions. However, others believe the discontent among Johnson’s ranks is not as severe as it was for May, who was toppled by her own party. “The party is pretty ruthless,” one cabinet minister said. “But I am not getting the sense this is anything like the days before the no confidence vote in Theresa May. Cabinet has some disagreements but compare it to what came before. It’s chalk and cheese.” Even so, there was a consensus that Tory MPs would make a move if they felt the polls had turned convincingly in Labour’s favour or their own local areas appeared to be lost causes. A senior MP told the Guardian they believed the party had “already lost my seat” so felt “ungovernable”. Another said there had been an “erosion of authority”. “Boris has become politically toxic to the electorate,” the MP said. “They think the PM’s incompetent and a liar, and the parliamentary party isn’t far behind. He is incompetence personified.” Others in this camp said they were not going to put a letter in to call for Johnson’s resignation at this stage – but were gradually being convinced it might be necessary, if things deteriorated further. “The key is in the ignition,” said one of Johnson’s own ministers.",News/Politics,‘Key is in the ignition’ for Tory leadership challenge to Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/11/key-is-in-the-ignition-for-tory-leadership-challenge-to-johnson
12/11/2021,"Ghislaine Maxwell has long been accused of luring teenage girls into Jeffrey Epstein’s orbit for him to sexually abuse, but whatever motive for allegedly doing so has long remained a mystery.  The answer hinges somewhat on the nature of their relationship. Did Maxwell serve as the late financier’s consigliere, or act as his girlfriend and procurer? Over the past two weeks, Maxwell’s Manhattan federal court sex trafficking trial has shed more light on her alleged financial and emotional ties to disgraced financier Epstein and how their lives seemed intimately interwoven. What that might mean for the trial is uncertain. Prosecutors might hope Maxwell’s closeness to Epstein might horrify the jury, who could conclude she was an accomplice. The defense team might see Epstein and his known crimes as a shield. Trial evidence over the past two weeks, including a now infamous photo of a cleavage-baring Maxwell massaging Epstein’s foot, also reveals an apparent romantic connection that elevates her role in his life beyond that of a mere fixer and friend. Maxwell, 59, is the daughter of the late British publishing mogul Robert Maxwell. She was apprehended at a luxurious New Hampshire rural estate in July 2020. She is now being tried for six counts in relation to her alleged involvement in Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor teenagers. She maintains her innocence of all allegations. Epstein, a convicted sex offender whose powerful and wealthy circle of associates included Prince Andrew and former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, killed himself in a New York City federal jail more than two years ago, pending his own sex trafficking trial. The first witness, Lawrence Paul Visoski Jr, Epstein’s pilot from 1991 to 2019, quickly provided jurors a description of their relationship, saying: “I thought it was more personal than business.” While Visoski didn’t see them hold hands or kiss, they struck him as “couple-ish”. They remained close into the 2000s, he said. David Rodgers, who also worked as Epstein’s private pilot over the same time period, said that he first met Maxwell in July 1991. “Early on, they were romantically involved.” Both Visoski and Rodgers said that Maxwell was integral in addressing Epstein’s quotidian needs, managing his expansive properties, hiring house staff, handling their expenses, and sometimes scheduling flights. They both described Maxwell as “No 1” in the hierarchy of Epstein’s employees. “Ms Maxwell was the girlfriend of Mr Epstein; I understand she was the lady of the house,” recalled Juan Alessi, the former house manager at Epstein’s Palm Beach home between around 1990 and 2002. “From the day she came to the house, she right away took over, and she mentioned to me she was going to be the lady of the house. Also, she was in charge of other homes, other properties.” Maxwell, who warned him to “never” look Epstein in the eye, went so far as to give Alessi a handbook toward the end of his time there, which featured mandates such as “try and anticipate the needs of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell, and their guests” and “remember that you see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at you. Respect [guests’] privacy.” Prosecutors have contended that Maxwell had a strong motive in maintaining a relationship that blurred these lines of life and work. In a discussion with judge Alison Nathan about the admissibility of testimony, prosecutors claimed that Maxwell “was not a particularly wealthy person when she met Epstein” in 1991. The government has discussed Maxwell’s monetary interest in open court as well. Prosecutor Lara Pomerantz said in her opening: “These girls were just a means to support her lifestyle, a way for the defendant to make sure that Epstein – who demanded constant sexual gratification from young girls – remained satisfied so that the defendant could stay in the lifestyle to which she was accustomed.” Several witnesses’ testimony suggested that Epstein was bankrolling Maxwell handsomely. Kate, the second accuser to testify against Maxwell, recalled: “She told me that she owned her house in London; and that at a later time she told me that she owned her house in New York City, and that Jeffrey had got it for her.” Prosecutors also called an officer from JP Morgan bank to discuss cash transfers from Epstein’s accounts to Maxwell’s. This banker, Patrick McHugh, explained documents which showed that Epstein transferred more than $30m to Maxwell’s accounts between 1999 and 2007. Allegations of Maxwell’s involvement in Epstein’s abuse have portrayed her as being so transfixed that she enthusiastically did his bidding. Kate, who said that Maxwell lured her into Epstein’s orbit in 1994 at age 17, recalled sexualized conversations with her. “She would talk a lot about the nature of … she would say boys, and boys and their willies, which was a euphemism for penis … how demanding Jeffrey was,” Kate recalled. “And she would ask me if I knew anybody who could come and give Jeffrey [oral sex] because it was, it was a lot for her to do.” “She said, ‘You know what he likes: cute, young, pretty, like you’ … She said he needed to have sex about three times a day.” Accusers also described Maxwell as assessing their encounters with Epstein, and claimed that she relished in satisfying his needs. “She said, ‘I’m so glad you’re here. You did such a good job last time, he wanted you to come back,” Kate recalled of one encounter. “Did you have fun? You’re such a good girl. I’m so happy you were able to come.” Carolyn, who testified that she was 14 when Maxwell started scheduling sexualized massages with Epstein, recalled receiving praise. “I was upstairs setting up the massage table and at that point I was kind of comfortable because I’d been there so many times,” Carolyn said. “I was getting fully nude, and she came in and felt my boobs and my hips and my buttocks and said … that I had a great body for Mr Epstein and his friends.” The first accuser who testified, Jane, said that there were times when Maxwell was present when Epstein abused her. At times, Maxwell touched Jane’s breasts, she alleged. “There were hands everywhere,” Jane recalled of one incident with Maxwell. Jane alleged being in group sexual encounters with Maxwell, Epstein, and others. And then there are the photos. CDs that were taken from Epstein’ Manhattan home during a July 2019 search contained numerous images that showed he and Maxwell posing together. In several pictures, she is kissing him. Several images reveal Maxwell giving Epstein a foot massage, beaming as if that act gave her incomparable joy.",News/US news,"Friend, lover, fixer?

12/11/2021,"Independent restaurants are being forced to offer hefty sign-on bonuses of £1,000 or more for chefs and other kitchen staff as the shortages of skilled workers tightens in the busy festive season. Small businesses such as Angie’s and D Grande, both restaurants in Chiswick, west London, the Coniston Hotel in Skipton, and Galeta, a bakery in Hackney, east London, are offering sign-on fees of between £500 and £1,000. Larger rivals are offering even more: recruits at Harry’s Bar, the Mayfair private members club owned by the hospitality entrepreneur Richard Caring, will get £2,000, while the Côte bistro chain is also dangling £2,000.  The job search site Indeed said that less than 1% of hospitality job ads currently mentioned a signing-on fee but the number of posts in the industry offering such a bonus had soared fivefold (443%) since the end of May. “This is a new phenomenon for the hospitality industry that doesn’t show signs of abating, despite Omicron, as we head into the Christmas season,” a spokesman for Indeed said. Steven Whibley, the operations director of Galeta, said he was offering a sign-on bonus of £1,000 after three months in the job on top of a salary of up to £40,000 in order to secure a head of bakery. The business is also offering £500 bonuses for less senior roles such as chefs de partie and drivers, posts which are also proving difficult to fill. Whibley said: “We currently have 20 vacancies and our fully staffed team would be 60 people, so that is about a third missing. We are filling that with overtime and agency staff where we can. The problem has been there since the summer but it’s got tougher as the business has expanded with the opening up of the economy. We’ve got busier and busier, and the staffing needs more acute, and we have lost staff as other people are offering more.” Whibley said the business had already upped basic pay by 10% as well as offering the bonus but will still be struggling to recruit staff. “It doesn’t seem they are there.” Angie Steele, the owner of Angie’s in Chiswick, said she was offering a £1,000 bonus for chef roles as she faced the prospect of shutting two days a week, ending dinner service and laying off serving staff as she was struggling to replace three of her six chefs who are about to leave the business. She said that even with the bonus, the restaurant had attracted only two applications, neither of whom showed up for their interview. “Two years ago if a chef left I would put an ad out and get four or five CVs and we would have gone to [kitchen] trials next day and I would have a choice. Now there are no CVs and no one is walking through the door. It is pretty extraordinary.” She said that Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic had had a “huge impact” on the UK hospitality industry, with staff going home to mainland Europe when restaurants were forced to close and not returning to the UK. Steele said she had been forced to offer a sign-on bonus because so many other restaurants were doing so in the battle for staff. “It is not a very nice atmosphere,” she said, with rumours that some restaurants are offering customers free food in return for recommending staff from elsewhere.",News/Business,"Staff shortages: small restaurants forced to offer £1,000 sign-on bonuses",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/11/staff-shortages-small-restaurants-forced-to-offer-sign-on-bonuses
12/11/2021,"As Omicron cases are on the increase and a new wave threatens to overshadow Christmas, the scientists working on Covid are also making calculations about which of their own festivities to go ahead with and which to scale back. Prof Jennifer Rohn, cell biologist at University College London  I was supposed to be flying to the US, but the airline cancelled the flight and the town is in total lockdown, so the agonising decision about whether or not to risk it was taken neatly out of my hands. I find I’m relieved to be grounded at home, given the current uncertainties about the impending Omicron wave. Unfortunately, the university cancelled all work parties, and the usual personal invitations haven’t materialised this year. This weekend, my book club is meeting up in a pub for Christmas drinks. I was wavering about whether or not to attend until I saw the latest results for how well the Pfizer booster fights Omicron – which makes me think I’m going to chance it. We are looking forward to seeing a Christmas play in the West End. I haven’t been to the theatre since before Covid times and I’m so relieved that plan B hasn’t scuppered this. This year we plan to keep our holidays mostly in the immediate family, though we expect a few flyby visits from some relatives. We’ve been so busy and stressed for so long that the thought of just being together enjoying all the Christmas rituals and food is strongly appealing. As is lounging around in my jim-jams working through the stack of novels that have been gathering dust on my bedside table all year. Prof Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London We cancelled our university and Zoe [app] Christmas parties, which was disappointing, but I’ve still been socialising. I had a celebration day out at Windsor Castle last week to get my OBE from last year. I had to get a lateral flow test within a few hours of meeting Charles and there was lots of social distancing and mask-wearing. Afterwards, I had a night at the opera and a meal with the four of us. I’m meeting my brother and his family – again doing lateral flow tests that morning and checking that nobody has any cold-like symptoms. We’re trying to socialise in small groups. Over the holidays, I’m planning to go to the Spanish Pyrenees to do some walking and skiing. At the moment Spain has very low levels – about 10 times lower than the UK. But there’s always that worry travelling at the moment. Until you’ve arrived, you’re thinking, will I catch Covid before I go or will they suddenly change the regulations? I’m looking forward to having a few days off and not talking about Covid. It will be time to turn off the mobile phone and not look at the news for a couple of days. Prof Eleanor Riley, immunologist at the University of Edinburgh I’m staying close to home in Edinburgh for the duration of the holidays and not planning to attend any particularly large or loud parties. A few friends at home or in the pub will be the limit, I expect. We’re not having any extended family gatherings, it will be just immediate family and a friend or two. I’m looking forward to hunkering down in front of the fire, catching up on some great books and films I missed during the year and, with a bit of luck, some crisp walks in the winter sunshine. Prof Neil Ferguson, epidemiologist at Imperial College London I always have a small Christmas. I was hoping I could see my parents over a holiday season for the first time since the pandemic started. Now somewhat weighing that up at the moment. At Imperial College, we’ve now stopped Christmas parties. It’s a decision I support here, but people make their own judgments about what is appropriate. All [my parties] have been cancelled. Contact rates over the Christmas period are generally much lower than they are either side of the Christmas period – people, children, are not in school people are not in work. Whether people have relatives around for Christmas lunch will not make an enormous difference. If lots of people have wild parties that may make a difference. I think people can be sensible and judge the risks.",News/UK news,A Covid Christmas: top scientists on how they will navigate party season,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/11/a-covid-christmas-top-scientists-on-how-they-will-navigate-party-season
