2/9/2022,"Ed Sheeran and Bring Me the Horizon  Is there no genre that Sheeran cannot subsume into his oeuvre? Apparently not, because here he is performing his hit Bad Habits with British metallers Bring Me the Horizon and a cohort of goth circus performers and/or rejects from the musical Cats. He starts the song alone, but the double billing means we’re holding our breath for the inevitable metal RAWRRRRR – and here it comes courtesy of Oli Sykes! RAWWRRR! RAWWRRRRRR! It’s basically the KLF and Extreme Noise Terror at the 1992 Brit awards. Maybe a 30th anniversary celebration, in fact. Yes, that must be it. Anyway, the Brits love a mashup and here’s a characteristically naff one – complete with those shopping trolleys from the red carpet – albeit one that nods to the versatility (some might say blandness, who could say, couldn’t be me) of Sheeran’s songwriting. Anne-Marie and KSI “Another iconic collaboration,” says Mo Gilligan, introducing Anne-Marie and KSI. We get a bit of an Anne-Marie medley at the start – then she takes a very painful looking tumble down the red steps at the top of the stage! To her credit, she pulls it back with barely a wince and rejoins the choreo. Within seconds, she’s slapping a button, triggering some pyro, and kicking a man off a podium (must have been cathartic after that fall). Sadly, she does not do a Patti Smith at Glastonbury and shout: “Yeah, I fell on my fucking ass at Glastonbury. But you know why? Because I’m a fucking animal, that’s why!” Instead, there’s a man wearing a pink egg for a head on the decks, then here’s KSI and off they go into Don’t Play Games With My Heart for half a minute before we get KSI’s Holiday, a phenomenally drippy lighters-up moment. Iconic? Errr … Little Simz “She is one of our hottest new artists,” says Mo Gilligan, of a rapper who released her debut mixtape in 2010. Come on, Mo! It sometimes feels like Simz is kept in a perpetual state of arrival, hailed as a “breakout star” when she’s been releasing brilliant albums for the last six years. But if anything is finally going to rocket launch her into public consciousness, it is this unbelievable, grin-inducing performance. It starts with Simz concealed by dancers clad in burgundy, a vision of communality that recalls Solange’s gorgeous live shows. She emerges from their midst in a fabulous black leather trench coat to sing the title track from her 2021 album, Sometimes I Might Be Introvert. Then Emma Corrin – yes, The Crown’s Princess Diana! – appears to perform their interstitial parts from the album, encouraging Simz to embrace the journey of becoming a woman. And then, like magic, the stage turns red, Simz’s leather coat has become a soft furry number, and she’s flanked by dancers in silky pantsuits for the wonderful Woman, with its chorus vocals by Cleo Sol. Simz may be shy in person, but she’s in her element on stage: effortlessly cool, putting the night’s previous try-hard performances to shame, rapping with spirit and admiration and well-earned confidence as she sings of “innovating just like Donna Summer in the 80s”. “Woman to woman, I just wanna see you glow, tell ‘em!” she sings, popping a little shoulder flex. I can report a sensation of rosy warmth from the sofa, so I hope Simz is absolutely basking in it. Liam Gallagher He’s flown in by helicopter to ‘av it in a trapper hat and sing a brand new song that precisely nobody wants to hear. If your new music sounds like plodding, fist-through-a-wet-paper-bag Oasis cast-offs – and you’re going to bring Bonehead with you on guitar! – just play the hits, man! Having Liam here is a strange tactic from the Brits, too, if they’re looking to lure in a younger audience, although I was recently disturbed to learn of the massive cohort of teenage Britpop lovers using TikTok to debate whether Liam or Noel was the biggest dilf. (Liam tbf.) Apparently this song was inspired by Gimme Shelter, which is quite the understatement given that telltale bit of piano boogie at the end, literally the only trace of colour in a ferociously drab, pile-driving four minutes. “Oh my gosh, how epic was that!” says Mo Gilligan. Not epic at all, Mo. The days when Liam could coast on fronting at the Brits are long, long gone. Holly Humberstone Here’s this year’s Rising Star winner – beloved by Olivia Rodrigo, as we just learned – making her TV debut. You wonder whether the 22-year-old Lincoln songwriter shouldn’t have played one of her better known songs – the euphoric Scarlett or dramatic The Walls Are Way Too Thin – instead of the featherlight new single London Is Lonely. But what starts a little wispy, the vocals barely audible, forces closer listening, and Humberstone, walking towards the camera and staring straight down the lens, seems rightly confident in her ability to command attention. Her shadowy dancers flit through the background as the song gains in melodic magnetism, as so many of Humberstone’s singles do, and the drama picks up when the electrics seem to cut out, the dancers walk away and Humberstone finishes the song alone at the piano, surrounded by white lights. Adele The I Drink Wine singer starts her set with I Drink Wine, of course. And dressed as the Quality Street toffee penny, too. Perhaps after Anne-Marie’s tumble, she’s taking no chances and performs the song perched on a piano. What starts as a low-key, tipsy gals together singalong quickly gives way to some proper Adele virtuosity, backed by a small gospel choir. The hints of self-awareness in her face in the first verse dip away by the second, as she leans into the feeling of the song, grimaces with the full force of her emotions and clutches at her heart. The small-scale performance preserves the humanity and directness of the song: “You can’t fight fire with fire,” she sings with an exasperated look, as if she were trying to drum the advice into a mate at the pub. Her seductive boozy melodrama takes a brief digression into full diva at the end, with a tantalising glimpse of vocal overdrive – but then she dials it back down to earth. Lovely, though I reckon people were expecting more especially given how rehearsed she must have been for her cancelled Vegas shows. May the I Drink Wine singer go and enjoy some wine now her professional duties are done. Sam Fender The War on Drugs may have just lost out on international group but here’s their spirit (and their mutual Springsteen DNA) in the superb Sam Fender, another British star who deserves every bit of success coming his way. (The War on Greggs? Needs work – ed.) Curiously, this classicist rock song has blown up on TikTok, where it soundtracks videos about overcoming abuse (as well as sparkly fancams about Fender being a “top tier indie boi”). Although there’s been a fairly conspicuous lack of political commentary to usual at the Brits tonight – and there’s plenty of low-hanging fruit to go at – Fender singing about his mother, who has fibromyalgia, struggling to get help from the Department for Work and Pensions, is a powerful moment not to be underestimated in the middle of a shiny floor entertainment show. Ed Sheeran, again Here’s The Joker and the Queen, a sugary slab of classic Sheeran sentimentality played largely on acoustic guitar: his lady could have absolutely anyone, “a thousand kings and hearts that could give you a diamond ring”, and yet, she chooses this guy. To his credit, he knows a lot of card playing-related puns and he’s not afraid to use them. My cynicism meters are off the charts, my teeth are aching from the saccharine strings – this makes Bread’s Make It With You sound like Sabbath – and yet... the millennial Neil Sedaka comes back to this MOR slush mode so often that you can only believe he means it, and good for him. Maybe we could all learn from his guileless submission to romance, to minimising unnecessary second-guessing. That said, Bring Me the Horizon were wasted on Bad Habits. This could definitely have been livened up with some throat-grating wails. Dave It’s Dave performing In the Fire with help from Fredo, Ghetts, Meekz, Giggs and a gospel choir. Unlike his 2020 Brits performance in which he attacked prime minister Boris Johnson as “a real racist”, this performance is all about pure feeling, Dave detailing the experience of being at risk of deportation, and how “everythin’ but my mum’s pay’s on the rise”. It may well be its own form of limitation to expect political artists to keep on making political statements, and so this is a well earned moment of full-frontal emotional expression that climaxes with Dave ripping a solo on a guitar that shoots real flames out of the neck.",Arts/Music,"Brit awards 2022: every performance reviewed, from Adele to Dave and Little Simz",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/08/brit-awards-2022-every-performance-reviewed-from-adele-to-little-simz
2/9/2022,"Nothing sets the heart racing in quite the same way. The anticipation, the excitement, the apprehension – the risk of being hurt again. The fluttering prospect that this one, this time, could be something special. Yes, we’re watching a new romantic comedy-drama, Cheaters (BBC One). Josh (Joshua McGuire) and Fola (Susan Wokoma) meet, pretty cutely, in an airport, when their flight back from Finland is delayed. He annoys her – accidentally, by spilling her coffee, then self-righteously, by interfering in an argument she is having with an airline employee. Later on, frustrated and stranded for the night, the pair meet again by chance in a hotel bar. They end up in bed, and not in a Steve Martin/John Candy way. Josh has already said he has a longterm girlfriend, who has recently cheated on him; in the morning, Fola shocks him by saying she is married.  The big “romcom coincidence” is revealed at the end of episode one, although discussing it isn’t too much of a spoiler because each instalment is only 10 minutes long – of which more later. As romcom coincidences go, it’s a whopper: Josh and Fola return home independently to discover that they are, since Fola and her husband’s very recent house purchase, neighbours. Of course they live in Peckham, the most newly desirable area of London at the time of filming, and, of course, in lovely houses: steps up to the door! They live bang opposite each other, too, a convenience utilised by episode three’s rather unlikely closing shot, when Cheaters takes on a Woman in the Window (Whom I Have Secretly Slept With) vibe. Anyway, they had planned to forget what happened and, instead, work on their relationships. As soon as Fola arrives home, to a civil but physically indifferent welcome from hubby, we see that her relationship needs as much repair as Josh’s. But Josh and Fola forgetting about each other isn’t going to be possible. Cheaters must make a fine judgment on how likeble to make the other halves, since, presumably, we are signing up to endorse their erring on the wrong side of fidelity. It falters a bit here, with the blase, oversexed Esther (Callie Cooke) and the so-undersexed-he’s-actually-a-bit-sinister both initially too cartoonish; but it is strong on the guilt that engulfs Josh and Fola the instant they arrive home and see their wronged partners. You can almost taste the ash in their mouths. Those small but key moments are all the work of McGuire and Wokoma, who are both excellent: McGuire is slightly stereotypical but funny as an overthinking nerd who struggles to keep any emotion hidden or under control; Wokoma is even better, with more to play with as a woman whose outward assertiveness masks her vulnerability. Romcoms live or die by the little looks on actors’ faces, and Cheaters might make it thanks to Susan Wokoma. When Josh’s inept patter starts to have an impact on Fola – just when the annoyance of a cancelled flight and the deep unease of a sexless marriage are combining with alcohol – Wokoma’s side-glancing, sparking look is spot on. When Fola has one more go at suggesting sex with Zack – in the ideal moment after they have just successfully hosted a party, but the hour is not too late – and he still says no, Wokoma plays it to perfection, her face gently deflating, as Fola crumples inside. Later on, when Fola looks at Josh and realises she is going to get them both in a lot of trouble, Wokoma’s eyes widen, her lips part, and there is the hint of desperation at the knowledge of what is to come. The short episode length doesn’t add anything, nor does it do any damage. And it’s hard to imagine the innovative linear scheduling – episode one shown before the BBC Ten O’Clock News, with a double bill of episodes two and three after it – having much effect. Is the target demographic really attention-deficient enough to balk at 30-minute instalments, or more likely to snack on iPlayer, 10 minutes at a time. By the end of episode three, although writer Oliver Lyttelton has hit his beats at the close of every 10-minute snapshot, we’re exactly where we would be at the end of a regular episode one. So, where are we? We’ve laughed plenty and ridden out some awkward moments. We can see Cheaters’ flaws and perhaps it’s not a keeper, but we’re feeling the characters’ yearning and we’re starting to share it. Let’s give this a go.",Arts/Television & radio,"Cheaters review – as romcom coincidences go, this one’s a whopper",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/08/cheaters-review-as-romcom-coincidences-go-this-ones-a-whopper
2/9/2022,"Antonio Conte has made clear that Cristian Romero is a Tottenham player for the long term, revealing that the club have “bought him” and there is no mere option to sign him on a permanent basis in the summer after an initial loan. “We have an obligation to buy … we bought him,” Conte said, reducing what has been a complicated deal to its simplest terms.  Romero moved to Spurs from Atalanta last August, with the selling club announcing it would be – at first – a loan until the end of the season. The purchase price is €55m (£46.4m) and it is locked in for the 23-year-old Argentina centre-half, who Conte described as feeling like a “new signing”. Romero got himself sent off in Conte’s first game as the Spurs manager – the 3-2 Europa Conference League win over Vitesse on 4 November – and then played the 90 minutes of the 0-0 Premier League draw at Everton. After that, he tore a hamstring on international duty and returned only in Saturday’s 3-1 FA Cup win over Brighton. Romero has been closely linked in recent years to Fabio Paratici, Spurs’ managing director of football, who officially started his job last July. In the summer of 2019, Paratici – working at Juventus – signed Romero from Genoa for €26m before loaning him back to Genoa for the season. The following summer, Paratici loaned him to Atalanta, inserting an option for them to make the transfer permanent in the summer of 2021 for €16m, which they would take up. Paratici then brought Romero to Spurs. Romero was named as the best defender in Serie A last season and he helped Argentina to win the Copa América last summer. “Romero is perfect for the Premier League,” Conte said. “He’s strong physically, he has the timing to anticipate and good personality to play with the ball. Despite being a young player, he has good experience, he’s strong. I like him. For sure, he has a lot of space for improvement.” Conte, who enjoyed a successful 13-year stint at Juventus during his playing career, was asked whether he would have been able to cut it in England’s top division. “I would have liked to play in the Premier League, I tried to get this experience,” Conte said. “I know that Alex Ferguson liked my football. I know in the past there was a moment that maybe Manchester United wanted to bring me there. My agent told me this but I don’t know if this is a lie or the truth!” Conte will be without the injured Oliver Skipp, Eric Dier and Japhet Tanganga for the visit of Southampton on Wednesday night. He hopes that Skipp, who has a groin problem, can be back in one week or “10 days maximum”, although the medical department have said it will be two weeks. Dier’s thigh injury is not thought to be serious.",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte backs ‘perfect’ Cristian Romero for long-term success at Spurs,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/08/antonio-conte-backs-perfect-cristian-romero-for-long-term-success-at-spurs
