12/30/2021,"The Christmas attack on Hong Kong website Stand News was no great surprise, in a city where all forms of political opposition are being dismantled wholesale, but the scale, speed and nature of the operation to shutter this pro-democracy website were still shocking. Over 200 police officers swept into the newsroom, and others fanned out over the city making arrests under a harsh sedition law from the days of British colonial rule that had been gathering dust for decades.  Activists warned that the legal charges used against the website could effectively make any critical journalism illegal in Hong Kong, after a senior police officer said they were based in part on publication of news reports that ‘incited hatred towards the Hong Kong government’. “They are making it illegal to do honest reporting,” said Nathan Law, exiled pro-democracy activist. “If you ‘incite hatred’ to the government by reporting truthful news, you are also subject to this law, which means you can only talk about the positive side of the government now. This is the signal they are trying to send.” Establishment links and foreign passports are no protection; those detained include former board members and pop star Denise Ho, who is also a Canadian citizen, and Christine Fang, who spent years at the heart of the Hong Kong elite including serving on multiple government committees. The fact that both had stepped down from their positions months earlier, when Stand News also took down much of the political commentary on their site, was also ominous. It suggested that even those who have tried to accommodate the new political order may still face punishment for past work. “It means that being a respected establishment figure or having a foreign passport won’t spare you. They had already stepped down. Short of renouncing their previous involvement, what more could they have done?” said Yuen Chan, senior lecturer in Journalism at City, University of London. Stand News was the most prominent and influential pro-democracy site left in Hong Kong after authorities forced popular tabloid Apple Daily to shut this summer, raiding its newsroom, freezing its assets and detaining key members of staff. While that closure took days, Stand News was out of operation within hours, with Hong Kong authorities more confident and experienced after months of using new legal powers to shutter groups from civil society to major media outlets, dismantling the political opposition. Among tributes to Stand News, many reporters and readers shared a list the outlet created of organisations disbanded over the last year. There were over 50, even before Stand News was added. The erasure of dissent has extended the city’s physical landscape, with the pre-Christmas removal of memorials commemorating Beijing’s deadly 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square democracy protesters. Just months earlier the shuttered website had been held up by pro-Beijing lawmaker Regina Ip as an example of press freedom still surviving in Hong Kong, amid widespread international condemnation of the closure of Apple Daily. Now journalists are wondering who, in a city with a fast-diminishing number of independent reporters and outlets, will be next. “The arrests of six people associated with Stand News amounts to an open assault on Hong Kong’s already tattered press freedom, as China steps up direct control over the former colony,” said Steven Butler, Asia program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists. “Authorities must release the six and drop all charges against them immediately if Hong Kong is to retain any semblance of the freedoms that its residents enjoyed only a few years ago.”",News/World news,Speed of Stand News shutdown sends chilling signal to Hong Kong’s media,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/speed-of-stand-news-shutdown-sends-chilling-signal-to-hong-kongs-media
12/30/2021,"Sharjah left it late at Leopardstown on Wednesday but the most reliable Christmas bet of recent seasons eventually delivered for his backers, edging a neck in front of Zanahiyr to win the Grade One Matheson Hurdle for the fourth time and emulate Istabraq and Hurricane Fly, two of jumping’s all-time greats, as he did so. Sharjah was favourite for two-mile contest for the first time in his career, having started at 6-1, 9-2 and 11-2 for his three previous successes, but he was only fourth turning for home and needed some encouragement from Patrick Mullins to launch his challenge.  The final hurdle was bypassed due to the low sun and while Zanahiyr fought gamely to cling on to the lead, Sharjah responded to claim the win with a couple of strides to spare. “That was not good for the heart,” Willie Mullins, the winner’s trainer, said. “Patrick said he wasn’t as sharp as other years and then with the last hurdle missing, he got pushed out on to yesterday’s ground and that just blunted his speed in the last furlong. “He managed to do it anyhow and it was a terrific race. He’s been a spectacular horse, fantastic for Patrick and Rich and Susannah [Ricci, Sharjah’s owners].” Sharjah has made four trips to the Cheltenham Festival in his career without success, although he has finished second in the last two renewals of the Champion Hurdle and was brought down at the third flight in 2019. He has also been below his best in the last two runnings of the Irish Champion Hurdle in February and Mullins may send him straight to Cheltenham this time around. “It might be the thing to do,” Mullins said, “as [the Irish Champion] doesn’t seem to work for him.” Sharjah remains third-favourite for the Champion Hurdle at around 10-1, in a market headed by the unbeaten Honeysuckle, last year’s winner, at a top price of 4-5. At Newbury, Stage Star extended his unbeaten record over hurdles to three races with a convincing six-and-a-half length defeat of West Balboa in the Grade One Challow Novice Hurdle. Paul Nicholls’s five-year-old was cut to around 8-1 for the Ballymore Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham in March, a race in which his stable companion, Bravemansgame, finished third last season after landing the Challow. “We might follow the same route that Bravemansgame did last year,” Nicholls said. “He is straightforward and that was a really taking performance. “I can’t believe how much speed he has got [and] that is by far and away the best performance he has given. All in all a great performance from a horse who is going to be a lovely chaser in time.” Stage Star is now one of three horses at single-figure odds for the Ballymore, along with Henry de Bromhead’s Journey With Me, who readily defeated Kilcruit, one of last season’s best bumper horses, in a maiden hurdle at Leopardstown on Wednesday. Journey With Me and Sir Gerhard, last year’s Champion Bumper winner, are marginal favourites at a top price of 7-1.",Sport/Sport,Sharjah joins list of Irish greats with four-timer in Matheson Hurdle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/29/sharjah-joins-list-of-irish-greats-with-four-timer-in-matheson-hurdle-horse-racing
12/30/2021,"France has registered a national and European record for new coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in cases across the continent, with multiple countries hitting new highs. France reported 208,000 cases in the previous 24 hours, up from its previous record of almost 180,000 set the day before.  “This means that 24 hours a day, day and night, every second in our country, two French people are diagnosed positive for the coronavirus,” said the health minister, Olivier Véran. “We have never experienced such a situation,” he said, calling the increase “dizzying”. He said the situation in France’s hospitals was already worrying because of the Delta variant. Although the “massive wave” of Omicron cases had yet to have an impact on the healthcare system, he said it would inevitably do so eventually. The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Greece have all reported new case records this week, while beyond Europe the rolling seven-day average of new cases in the US hit a high of 267,000 on Tuesday, with Omicron accounting for 59% of these. New infections in Australia rose to nearly 18,300 on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous high of about 11,300 hit a day earlier. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the country needed “a gear change”. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the simultaneous circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants was driving an alarming tidal wave of infections that could lead to increases in hospitalisation and deaths. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “highly concerned that Omicron, spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases”. The WHO has said Omicron poses a “very high” risk and could submerge health systems. Studies in Britain, South Africa and Denmark suggest Omicron is less deadly than some of its predecessors, but the huge numbers of people testing positive mean hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed and businesses could struggle to carry on operating because of workers having to quarantine. The rapid transmission rate of the new variant is forcing governments to find a delicate balance between reimposing restrictions to protect hospitals and keeping economies and societies open. French MPs on Wednesday started debating a new law that would allow only vaccinated people to enter bars, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sports arenas and other public venues, with proof of a negative Covid test no longer to be accepted. In Italy, where private and public sector workers need a “green pass” proving vaccination, recovery or a negative test to enter the workplace, the government is also considering a proposal to exclude those who can only show a negative test. Regional leaders are also urging the Italian government to drop or reduce the isolation period for people who have received three shots of a Covid vaccine and are subsequently exposed to someone who has tested positive for the virus. “We can’t block the country by quarantining the contacts of people who test positive. Covid has changed, the majority of the population is vaccinated, we must also revisit the measures to confront it,” said Giovanni Toti, the president of the Liguria region. Italy is one of several countries to have cancelled or restricted public celebrations since the resurgence of the virus. Greece, which has also banned Christmas and new year festivities in public places, on Wednesday imposed new restrictions on the hospitality sector, bringing forward measures planned for early January, after authorities announced a new daily record of 21,657 cases, more than double Monday’s figure. Bars, nightclubs and restaurants will have to close at midnight, with no standing customers and no music, with the exception of New Year’s Eve when then can stay open until 2am. “These measures, if they are applied in our entirety, will allow us from mid-January to go back to our normal lives,” said the health minister, Thanos Plevris. Some countries are still waiting for the Omicron wave to hit. Case numbers are still falling in Germany, but its health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said the true number could be much higher because fewer tests were being done over the holiday season. He said the real incidence was “two or three times as high” as Wednesday’s reported rate of 205 Covid cases per 100,000 people over seven days, the lowest since November, adding that a sharp jump was expected “within a very short period of time”. On Tuesday Germany closed nightclubs and ordered organisers of sports events to hold them behind closed doors. It also limited private gatherings to 10 vaccinated people, or just two households if an unvaccinated person is present. The rules came on top of restrictions already hitting the unvaccinated, who are barred from shops, restaurants and cultural events. Lauterbach said the rules may have to be toughened further, as existing measures “will not be enough to prevent a significant rise in Omicron cases”. In Belgium, however, where case numbers are also relatively low, the government reversed course on Wednesday, allowing theatres and cinemas to reopen after a court suspended their closure. Meanwhile, other European countries are still grappling with the Delta variant. Poland reported 794 Covid-related deaths on Wednesday, the highest number in the fourth wave of the pandemic. The deputy health minister, Waldemar Kraska, said more than 75% of those who died were unvaccinated.",News/World news,"French daily Covid cases above 200,000 as Italy considers stricter green pass",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/french-daily-covid-cases-above-200000-as-italy-considers-stricter-green-pass
12/30/2021,"It has been years since football surged past cricket to become England’s favourite sport. Even so, more than a century after cricket’s “golden age”, an Ashes Test series between England and Australia remains one of the most resonant contests in the sporting calendar. This week, after the latest ignominious England defeat in Australia, it seems sensible to ask two questions. How come? And for how much longer? For some of us, cricket is still the most wonderful of all sports, uniquely balancing individual skill, collective effort and the need for time and strategy. But why are England now playing it so badly? The Ashes contest is uniquely deep-rooted in national legend. The Bradmans and Bothams cast long shadows. But why has this inspired Australians to heroic feats, while reducing England to nervous wrecks?  It was predictable that the latest humiliating defeat of Joe Root and his team would trigger a bout of cricket soul-searching. The finger of blame has been pointed at inadequate preparation, defective batting technique, dropped catches, poor spin bowling, and lacklustre coaching and captaincy. All these are relevant. But they don’t get at a deeper underlying “why?” The BBC’s Jonathan Agnew is among those who cast the net more widely. He points to enduring structural defects within English cricket itself. These include the marginalisation of the long form of cricket, of which Test matches are the pinnacle, in favour of the limited over “white ball” short forms that TV companies, advertisers and many supporters prefer. Not that this clash of codes seems to have troubled the Australians much. Few have yet tried to take a larger view. One who has is my Guardian colleague Jonathan Liew. He identifies a basic cultural difference between the Australian and English approaches. “To play Test cricket for Australia in 2021 still essentially means something,” Liew wrote this week, citing the match-winning performance of Scott Boland, only the second cricketer of Indigenous Australian heritage to wear the trademark baggy green cap. By contrast, Liew points out, “the very point of the England Test team has become somehow blunted, dissolved, obscured”. Again, one asks – why? The question would have been grist to the mill of arguably the 20th century’s most original writer on English cricket. It is half a century now since Rowland Bowen wrote what is still, for all its flaws and quirkiness, the single best cricket book of its era. But Cricket: A History of its Growth and Development Throughout the World, published in 1970, stands the test of time. On the face of it, Bowen was a character out of English cricket central casting. A retired Indian army officer and perhaps a former spy, he was one of that tribe of white, private school, upper-middle-class men whose fanaticism about cricket still forms a significant stratum of the English game’s support. To call him an eccentric would be an understatement. This was a man who, believe it or not, amputated his own right leg in his bathroom in 1968 to prove it could be done. His book, though, was another matter. Its central argument was that cricket’s rise reflected the flourishing of the industrial and imperial ages, and that English cricket was becoming unsustainable as industrial and imperial Britain came to an end. Bowen also thought cricket’s decline was intertwined with English racism – he pointedly chose the great Caribbean cricket writer and Marxist CLR James to write the introduction to his book – and he believed that most of the agonies of English cricket were caused by the wishes of those who controlled the game to preserve something that was historically doomed. As misguided determinists do, Bowen sometimes let his vision of epochal decline get the better of him. Fifty years on, cricket has not been reduced to “rough and ready” status, metal bats have not replaced wooden ones, Wisden still comes out each year and the counties continue to provide the basis of the English game. Cricket’s adaptability has been greater and more successful than Bowen expected. The shift in power over world cricket from England to India was not something he foresaw either. Even so, Bowen would have had a pretty clear understanding of why England get beaten in the Ashes so often. He would have put cricket’s problems in a larger social context. He would have said the pathways to cricket’s renewal and growth have been cut off, closed and neglected, making the game increasingly unsustainable at the grassroots, especially in state schools which have either had to sell their playing fields or never had them in the first place. He would have said cricket suffers because it is no longer even visible, either in the flesh or on terrestrial TV. He would have said this is because the game has become overprofessionalised, existing too exclusively for the benefit of those who play, administer, promote and make money out of cricket for a living rather than being encouraged to grow more organically and in new ways within English society as it is now. He would have looked to the popularity of cricket in the subcontinent as a striking alternative model. And he would have said cricket has not come to terms with its own racism. English cricket has a long, bad record on race, embodied by its support for apartheid-era South Africa. You know something is structurally wrong by comparing Gareth Southgate’s England football team, which often has five or more minority ethnic players and which is comfortable in its diversity, with Root’s side, which had just one player of non-European heritage this week. England footballers take the knee. Its cricketers do not. As Michael Holding powerfully says, cricket is simply not serious enough. By far the most important thing that happened in English cricket this year was not the Ashes defeat but the exposure of the game’s institutionalised racism. A third of recreational cricket players in England are of south Asian heritage; that dwindles to just 4% at the elite county level. The complaints made by the former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq have at last blown a hole in the culpable complacency of his former county. But Yorkshire – of which I am a member – is not the only club that needs to start again from scratch. It requires particularly powerful blinkers not to see links between these factors and England’s Ashes defeats. England cricket – and its overindulged Barmy Army of supporters – is too complacent, not very good and spends too much time in a bubble of Anglosphere exceptionalism. It is at risk of becoming a metaphor for Brexit, deluded about its abilities and achievements, promoting itself as the envy of the world when it is not, and resentful of its critics. The world has moved on. Perhaps cricket lovers should do so too.

12/30/2021,"What’s your ingredient of the year? An ingredient you ate for the first time, rediscovered, cooked a lot over the year, or learnt about this year? Incredibly, I never heard the same answer twice. If anyone is curious, mine is tamarind. I tried to mix up my use of acid this year (there’s more than just lemon and vinegar, I kept telling myself) and tamarind was what I landed on.  This is what everyone said. It’s been around my whole life – I really haven’t given it enough credit. My mum uses yoghurt as the base marinade in her biryani, and my favourite drink growing up in Mauritius was almond dahi, a lassi-style drinking yoghurt. Yoplait should make this available around the world, especially in Melbourne during summer. This year I’ve taken to making yoghurt weekly with Schulz Organic Dairy full cream milk, the most incredible, rich milk we can find. Our yoghurt culture has developed over the past few months into a fabulous being, with a beautiful subtle acidity and richness. Our yoghurt now contributes to a lot at our restaurant: cheeky breakfasts during prep mornings; the base for our kalia sauce, mixed with fresh herbs and masala; while the whey is used to season other dishes or kickstart ferments with a unique lactic note. Nagesh Seethiah is the owner and chef at Manze, a Mauritian wine bar and restaurant in Melbourne The collapse of the Chinese market for live coral trout has resulted in the domestic Australian market having unprecedented access to this truly delicious fish. Most of the coral trout fleet in north Queensland have built quality standards of catching and handling, commensurate with the demands of the live trade, and while most of the domestic demand is for dead fish, the quality is outstandingly good. John Susman runs Fishtales and is the co-author of Australian Fish and Seafood Cookbook My ingredient of year the has to be Korean chilli flakes, also known as gochugaru. The flakes are traditionally made from sun-dried chilli without the seeds. It’s quite mild in terms of heat, with a slightly sweet, fruity and smokey flavour. The flakes have a noticeably vibrant, red colour to them. We season our dishes with it and also make a chilli oil, which turns deeply red. Khanh Nguyen is the co-owner of Sunda and Aru, two Melbourne restaurants It has to be chicken. Such a versatile meat: bake it, fry it, stir-fry it. It absorbs flavour, it’s one of my favourite ingredients to work with. I use the thighs in curries. I’m a curry enthusiast and there’s a lot of varieties of curry – Thai, Japanese, Australian made with Keen’s – I make. The thighs have more flavour than the breast, they’re fattier and they cook better in curry sauce. The breasts can be good for baking and stir-frying, but chicken thighs are in a league of their own when it comes to curry. Nathan Lyons is a western Sydney cook who runs the affordability and accessibility focused TikTok cooking channel Kooking with a Koori “A few drops of Knorr liquid seasoning will complete your dishes with extra richness” – so goes the typeset promise on the sauce bottle. And what a promise. Drizzle it on hot white rice, dot it on just-cracked eggs while they’re sizzling in the pan, and – the ultimate “mod Oz” culinary litmus test – it works wonders with avo on toast. The condiment takes prime place in the hallowed halls of savoury brown-coloured foodstuffs, the likes of which includes soy sauce, fish sauce, Worcestershire sauce; the crusty bits of a steak; the glorious thickness of a good masoor dal. It helps too that the bottle comes in two novelty sizes – a petite 205ml for picnics and novices, and a gigantor 835ml for those who are serious about enveloping their world in raindrops of this savoury saviour. Yvonne C Lam is the digital editor (on maternity leave) at Gourmet Traveller Hakurei are a most delicious variety of Japanese turnip. They are white, around the size of a golf ball and have the most delectable crunch. I love to quarter them and throw them in a wok or wood-fired oven with good olive oil. Both the root and leaves are edible. With the leaves I often make “gundruk” – a Nepalese ferment where you lacto-ferment for a week or two, then sun-dry until they resemble tea leaves. They’re great sprinkled on salads. My favourite application for the roots is in a “perennial pickle bed” where they’re pureed with turmeric and garlic. This becomes rich in lactobacillus and, in time, you can simply submerge whole vegetables (in the paste) only to pluck them out weeks or months later when they’ve transformed into delicious, crunchy and acidic pickles. Adam James is a pickle and ferment enthusiast who makes and sells under the alias Rough Rice This is a lovely, soft tofu preserved in salt and rice wine, then stored in either oil or vinegar. I personally love the version stored in Sichuan chilli oil, similar to miso in its delicious texture and saltiness. It’s used in braises, marinades, and I love it as a creamy, umami punch in sauces, or sneaking a little spoon straight from the bottle. Rosheen Kaul is the head chef at Etta, Melbourne My first taste of mushroom in Australia were grey-brown slimy slices, in a grey-brown gravy tipped on to toast. Colour and texture notwithstanding, I was hooked on the earthy flavour. I’ve progressed since then, and these lockdown years I’ve been comforted by Japanese varieties – shiitake, enoki, cloud ear fungus and shimeji – added to a bowl of two-year fermented brown rice miso soup, umami-ed to the max. Paul van Reyk is food writer, historian and the author of True to the Land, A History of Food in Australia These fruit are undervalued in their abundance in the Philippines, but so revered in their scarcity by the Filipino diaspora. Like Philippine cuisine, calamansi is relatively unknown, and not commercially available at scale, yet. But if the success of yuzu is anything to go by, there’s hope. For now, you will find calamansi trees in backyards of Filipino households or, very rarely, at Asian grocers. Fides Santos-Arguelles is the cofounder of Entree.Pinays, an organisation on a mission to promote Philippine culture and cuisine I keep this beautiful spice and herb condiment within arm’s reach of my stovetop, I use it so often in my cooking. From za’atar man’ooshe (a flatbread with a za’atar and olive oil spread all over before baking), to a rub for roast chicken, or sprinkling it on hummus, labneh, eggs or avo on toast, I just love it. Beyond the spice mix, I can’t go without mentioning fresh za’atar. I’ve been on a mission this year to get people familiar with this herb, that’s often confused with oregano. They do look similar and are from the same family but za’atar has a distinct smell and flavour. It is this herb, dried, that is the main ingredient in the mix. I now have a large pot growing in my garden which I often use to make a traditional za’atar salad – which is simply the fresh leaves, sliced red onion and an olive oil, lemon juice and sumac dressing. Lina Jebeile is the owner and creator of The Lebanese Plate This year I’ve rediscovered a simple ingredient: besan flour. Also known as chickpea flour, it’s used a lot in Indian cooking to make pakoras, bhajis and dosas. I’ve been using chickpea flour, in my attempt to avoid gluten, and have found it to add crispness far better than wheat flour. I’ve also started adding it to my banana breads and cookie doughs, for that extra flakiness. My favourite thing to make with it is celeriac fritters: a bit of carom seeds, thinly sliced curry leaves, salt, pepper and a little bit of water to bind it all; then shallow-fry them and serve with a ginger-tamarind pickle. Delicious. Radha La Bia is the alias of Shahmen Suku, a performance artist and cook based in Sydney How do Hong Kong and Chinese restaurants achieve that silky egg (wat dan) texture? And why is the protein in your takeaway Chinese always so tender and velvety? And how can deep-fried tofu be so crispy? Cornstarch – or cornflour – is one of the MVPs of Chinese cooking. To call it a shortcut would be an insult to its ingenuity. I’ll never be able to recreate those classic dishes such as wat dan hor (rice noodles in silky egg gravy), or to perfectly marinate cheap cuts of beef in my beef and broccoli dish so that it tastes like a pricey cut. But cornstarch has been a revelation, taking my lockdown cooking damn close to the real thing. That’s the beauty of using such an ingredient, and the elegance and cleverness in Chinese cooking. Kevin Cheng is a journalist and cofounder of non-profit group Soul of Chinatown Living in Australia, I’d almost forgotten how we added protein and iron in our mostly plant-based diets back home. As much as I love my tofu and mushrooms, the idea of them, meal after meal, gets a bit depressing. Black chickpeas have saved the day multiple times a week for me, I cook them once and the batch keeps on giving. High in protein and fibre, they’re a magic ingredient to add to salads and wraps. I use the cooking water (black aquafaba) as stock for dals and rice, and one sip of this iron-rich liquid gold takes me back home to where my mother used to squeeze a lime into a cup of hot, salty aquafaba for a quick soup before dinner. Gunjan Aylawadi is a chef and owner of Flyover Fritterie, an Indian street food bar in Sydney This herbaceous flower is an ingredient we use in Malaysia a lot. Native to Malaysia and Indonesia, you’d find it in the forest where it grows really tall. It’s bright pink. It looks almost like a Waratah. We only use the bud – it’s very aromatic. I use it in kantan spiced chicken, where I slice the flower very thinly, mix it with other aromatics and stir-fry it, then I coat deep-fried chicken in the sauce. It’s got a piquant flavour; it’s a bit peppery. It’s my ingredient of the year because not many people know it, but whenever I describe it, my customers fall in love with it. Hisham Al-Bakri is the chef and owner at Kantan, a northern Malaysian restaurant in Melbourne Usually I’d pick cheese – it’s the ingredient of the year every year, isn’t it? But my secondary ingredient is yuzu. We’ve now got some great growers in Australia, and it’s becoming much more accessible and used in more and more interesting ways. I had a delicious kingfish ceviche at the beginning of the year which had a yuzu dressing, at Maxwell Wine. You see some sake and gins that have got yuzu, and I’ve also had a yuzu cheesecake that was off the charts. I use it to make citrus dressings at home. I balance it with lemon, because it’s such a strong flavour. Kym Masters is the director and head cheese maker at South Australia’s Section 28 We opened our restaurant this year and we’re trying to showcase Mexican food, so my ingredient is a fairly obvious one – corn. It’s such a foundational ingredient. We use a heap of corn: local Australian sweet corn and heirloom varieties we have to import from America. In Mexico, we have so many varieties that are all used for different purposes, some just for soup, some fresh, some for making tortillas, some for popcorn. I would love to see some heirloom varieties grown in Australia. Having conversations with farmers is next on the list, but as you know, nature has its own ideas. It might be a slow process. Juan Carlo is the head chef and co-owner of Maiz Mexican Street Food in Sydney What does the world need to survive, and hasn’t changed, hasn’t been doctored, in millions of years? Pollination. My ingredient of the year is honey. There are so many controversies around honey these days, because of the problems within our agricultural methods and the way we cotton on to certain fads in our diets. This came into the public consciousness around 10 years ago when the US and Europe were talking about bee death, and that came to Australia. We had this fad of nut milks and nuts – it’s a monoculture providing that produce. Bees don’t naturally occur in that environment; they have to bring them in. Then they sell their honeys as single-flower honeys, another fad they can market. The way we farm, we let all the natural grasses grow out and flower. Because of all that natural flowering, the honey takes on a really interesting flavour. It’s just such a joy to watch the bees too. Last year was the first year we brought on European bee boxes. We got 120kg of honey, and I’ve been lathering it on everything. This season’s honey tastes like citrus flowers, and the tea tree that was flowering at the time, at the farm across the road. It’s like liquid gold, more valuable than anything because it means my bees are thriving – and if they’re thriving, it means we’re not breaking the landscape. Palisa Anderson runs Boon Luck Farm, an organic farm in the Byron Bay area, as well as Chat Thai restaurants around Sydney Saltbush can be used in so many varied ways; it’s great in stir-fries – we learnt that from our friend Kylie Kwong. Because of the texture, it holds its bite. It doesn’t disappear like western spinach does. It’s also got great colour; I’m an artist and I love the contrast of the colour in a dish. And it can be tempura-ed to be a little crunchy thing to have with beer. It’s a terrific bar snack. I also make bread for my grandchildren and always put saltbush in – just for a little boost of vitamins. It also connects us to country and place. It’s about social consciousness around our First Nations communities and their food. To bring their food to our table is really relevant in this time. Saltbush is a pioneer plant, a great regenerator of the land. When you have land that has been overused, it can be salt that is the problem for using that land for agriculture. Saltbush will scavenge salt out of the ground and change it into a very useful mineral for people’s diet.

12/30/2021,"La Niña will likely dampen the summer plans of Australians across the eastern and northern parts of the country, meaning families may become even more reliant on their broadband connections to keep themselves entertained. But what if our online requirements and internet connections don’t stack up? The Bureau of Meteorology is predicting it will be a very wet summer, so if your household’s plans to go to the beach are replaced with Netflix, Switch and PlayStation, how do you make sure your internet connection is up to the task?  The easiest thing you can do is run a speed test. That will give you an indication of what you’re working with, noting that it’s probably best to test in peak hours – like the evening – to see the worst-case-scenario speeds. The streaming services, for example, will accomodate slower connections and adjust accordingly, but if you are wanting to stream Netflix or Apple TV in high definition, that will be around 5Mbps of speed needed per stream. If you’re wanting to stream in 4K, then it’s 25Mbps per stream. HD will likely be enough for most, but if you factor in multiple people using the internet at once in a household, then it adds up pretty quickly, and you might need to go to a higher plan. If you’re connected to the internet using the National Broadband Network, the first thing you should do is check with your internet service provider what speed plan you’re on, and what your download limit is per month. If you’re on a basic 12Mbps or 25Mbps plan, you may want to see if you can upgrade to something a bit faster, such as 50Mbps or 100Mbps. The higher the speed plan, the more likely your internet will be able to cope with more people streaming and gaming and doing all other online activities at once. You might not be able to actually change your plan, depending on the technology you use to connect to the NBN. Your internet service provider will be able to tell you the highest possible speed you’ll be able to achieve on your current connection, and the corresponding plan the company can then offer to you. If you are on a technology like fibre-to-the-node for the NBN and can’t get the higher speeds, NBN Co may be able to upgrade it for you, if you agree to be locked into a higher speed plan for a set period of time, or you agree to fund the fibre extension yourself. This is a much more expensive option, and will run into the thousands of dollars at a minimum, so it’s unlikely many people will choose this just to beat the wet summer blues. The other catch is, it probably won’t be done when you need it. NBN Co was initially starting to take orders from November this year, but the company did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia about whether that had gone ahead as planned. Even if the fibre extension was available, it would still take time to construct, so while in the long term you’ll get a faster NBN, it probably won’t be done before everyone heads back to work or school. If you live in an area where Telstra or Optus have rolled out 5G, their 5G services are incredibly easy to sign up for and set up at home, and very competitive with NBN plans. Optus’s plan is unlimited data from up to 210Mbps download speeds at $79 per month. The exit fee is just the cost of the modem. Telstra’s plan is $85 a month for 1TB of data, with average speeds of 378Mbps or up to 600Mbps. The plan is month to month, with no exit fees provided the modem is returned. Even if you can’t get 5G, if you are able to get 4G the home modem options are improving, and data rates are cheaper than they used to be. TPG offers home wireless broadband for $54 a month for up to 20Mbps, for example. In regional and remote areas of Australia that do not get good 4G or 5G coverage, your options may be more limited to what the NBN has to offer on fixed wireless or satellite (if they’ve connected you). If all else fails, you might have to put on the gumboots and raincoat and make the most of the summer rain.",News/Australia news, How to ensure your broadband internet will meet the demands of a wet summer,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/30/how-to-ensure-your-broadband-internet-will-meet-the-demands-of-a-wet-summer
12/30/2021,"Business groups have called on state governments to continue dismantling Covid restrictions even as case numbers soar amid staff shortages caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant. The groups renewed their demands for the increased use of rapid antigen testing to enable staff who come into contact with coronavirus cases to return to work quickly if they are free of the virus instead of having to wait at least a day for the results of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.  Covid numbers rocketed on Wednesday, with the number of new cases in the nation’s most infected state, New South Wales, nearly doubling overnight, from 6,062 to 11,201. Numbers in Victoria, which has the second highest number of cases, also jumped, rising from 2,738 to 3,767. However, business groups said the economic havoc wreaked by the new variant was mostly due to the responses to it by governments rather than being the direct effect of people getting sick. Innes Willox, the chief executive of employer association AI Group, said Australian business was “now suffering from state-induced chaos”. “The biggest danger to improving business conditions is not Omicron but the response to it especially by states who continue to act in muddle-headed, self-centred ways by imposing overly-onerous and ever-changing conditions on business, their employees and customers,” he said. “For our recovery to maintain its momentum business needs certainty and continuity from the states who can properly balance risks and not needlessly promote fear.” He said the state and federal governments needed to “make and stick to agreements on border openings, workable testing requirements, the increased use of rapid testing, isolation and distancing rules”. “They have had nearly two years to work this out and so far have failed miserably to work together,” he said. Andrew McKellar, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the Omicron outbreak had triggered “a degree of disruption”, some of it caused by the “over caution and overreaction” seen in some states. He singled out Queensland’s “very stringent PCR testing requirements and the strain that that’s put on resources”. “We’re still seeing from business that they are confident [and] they do expect that in the months ahead, we should be able to undergo a very strong period of economic activity,” McKellar said. “The main thing will be to avoid the imposition of very severe restrictions and lockdowns, and I think the signals from all jurisdictions has been that they understand that that has to be an absolute last resort,” he said. “There’s no appetite to go back into that space.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app McKellar said business groups had been calling since September for the provision of rapid antigen testing “as an important part of the armoury” against Covid-19, having watched developments overseas. It should be an issue for Australia-wide coordination through the national cabinet, he said. “The federal government has to have a leading role in this in sourcing these supplies and making them freely and widely available in the community to business,” McKellar said. “Here’s another golden opportunity for our political leaders to work in a unified way.” Jessica Wilson, the executive director at the Business Council of Australia, which represents the country’s biggest companies, said that to continue its economic recovery from the Covid recession the nation needed to “tear down remnants of fortress Australia” and “stay the course on reopening”. “That means using every tool we can to keep businesses operating, borders open and supply chains working, including using rapid antigen testing,” she said. “Every time a pub has to shut because of Covid it’s not just impacting the licensee but also staff, security, food providers and live music performers – all of who lose pay during this peak season.” Hospitality and retail businesses have so far borne the brunt of the Omicron wave, with many complaining they have been forced to close due to a lack of rapid testing. “This is the peak period for hospitality so to have another year ruined is devastating for businesses reeling after 20 months of restrictions,” John Green, the director of liquor and policing at the NSW branch of the Australian Hotels Association, said. Margy Osmond, the chief executive of the Tourism and Transport Forum, said staff who were forced to isolate after coming into contact with a Covid-positive person were leaving employers “high and dry”. “The announcements today that the Queensland government will accept a negative rapid antigen test from 1 January and that NSW will relax isolation requirements will be widely welcomed, and is a much more commonsense approach to managing the impacts of the latest outbreak ensuring that people who need to most can get a PCR test and those with holiday plans can make it to their destination,” she said. Alan Oster, the NAB Group chief economist, said the market was already bracing for a negative retail sales figure for December compared with the previous month but more because of the growing popularity of Black Friday online sales rather than a demand dent from Omicron. “I would have thought confidence might have had a bit of a hit,” Oster said. “[As for] actual conditions, their sales, their profits, their employment, I suspect less so. “It will be soft, and people will say it was Omicron but it won’t be – it’ll be the change when people buy from Black Friday rather than Boxing Day sales,” he said. NAB’s last economic report for 2021, released on 17 December, predicted Australia’s economy would rebound sharply from the 1.9% contraction in the September quarter. The bank is predicting a 4% expansion for Australia’s economy, less than the Reserve Bank of Australia’s 5.5% forecast. “I’m not sure [Omicron’s] going to change the outcome that much but I would not want to be defending a 5.5 to 6% growth rate in 2022,” Oster said. “We always assumed that international travel wouldn’t really start at least until the middle of next year,” he said, adding NAB’s other key assumption remains that governments don’t lock down borders. Anecdotally, Oster also cited evidence of uncertainty in the hospitality sector as households hesitate to make firm bookings because of the risks of sudden pandemic-triggered changes. His family, for instance, was able to book a table at “Sorrento’s best restaurant” for New Year’s Eve just two days in advance, when normally the place would have been filled long before.",News/Australia news,‘State-induced chaos’: business groups call for less restrictions even as Australia’s Covid cases soar,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/30/state-induced-chaos-business-groups-call-for-less-restrictions-even-as-australias-covid-cases-soar
12/30/2021,"As the Omicron variant causes Covid case numbers to surge across Australia, state governments have made a number of changes to rules for interstate travel. While many states relaxed their border restrictions after achieving high levels of vaccination, some have reintroduced certain rules in the wake of the Omicron outbreak and the rapid rise in case numbers.  Others have announced domestic travellers will be allowed to use rapid antigen test results before travelling instead of strictly requiring PCR tests. The changes have come as testing sites have been overwhelmed, with drive-in queues stretching around blocks and wait times ballooning across much of the country. Here’s a rundown of each state’s current domestic travel requirements. Domestic travellers to Victoria are no longer required to quarantine or have a permit to enter, regardless of vaccination status. Interstate travellers entering NSW do not need to apply for permits. There are, however, some requirements for people who are close or casual contacts after visiting “places of high concern” in the 14 days before travelling. Unvaccinated close contacts may not enter NSW; if they are identified as a close contact and have already travelled to NSW, they will need to complete 14 days of self-isolation. Fully vaccinated visitors who have been identified as close contacts interstate in the 14 days before arrival can enter NSW, but will need to self-isolate for seven days from the date of exposure. Close contacts who are already in NSW will also need to self-isolate for seven days from exposure. Casual contacts may enter if they have received a negative Covid test, and will need to complete an entry declaration form. Returning NSW residents who are close contacts interstate can come back to NSW to self-isolate. From 1 January, those travelling into Queensland from declared Covid hotspots will be able to cross the border with a negative rapid antigen test instead of a PCR test. Declared hotspots include all of NSW, ACT and Victoria, as well as all of greater Adelaide in SA and Katherine and Robinson River in the NT. Authorities have recommended that travellers complete a test on the same day they are due to travel, but will accept results up to 72 hours prior to arrival. “What that means is someone today who wants to come to Queensland, because it is within the 72 hours [before] 1 January, you can go and get a rapid antigen test and that will be the valid test for you to come into Queensland from today,” said police minister Mark Ryan in a press conference on Wednesday. From 28 December, Queensland will also no longer require hotspot travellers to get tested on day five after arrival. Chief health officer John Gerrard said he recommended the change after only 0.6% of interstate travellers returned positive tests on day five. All travellers, including those from non-hotspot areas, will still need an entry pass. People who have been required to isolate as close, casual or secondary contacts of a confirmed Covid case or interstate exposure site in the past 14 days cannot enter Queensland. Restrictions for travel into the ACT have been removed entirely, except for close contacts, who are required to complete an exemption form before travelling regardless of vaccination status. Once granted, the exemption will detail quarantine and testing requirements. There is no requirement for people who are not close contacts to provide proof of a negative Covid test. Returning ACT residents who are identified as close contacts may seek an exemption and, depending on vaccination status, complete their required seven or 14 days of isolation in the territory. Those who are notified of close contact status while already in the ACT will need to complete a declaration form. Fully vaccinated travellers from any state or territory can enter SA and will need to complete an application through EntryCheck SA. As of 26 December, arrivals from NSW, the ACT or Victoria no longer need to be tested after entry or on day six, but will need to have completed a negative PCR or rapid antigen test in the three days before travelling. Unvaccinated travellers will need to apply for an exemption. WA’s border remains under tight travel restrictions, with visitors from every other state or territory barred from entry unless they belong to a narrow set of approved travellers. Under current rules, travellers from jurisdictions deemed medium, high or extreme risk are not permitted into the state. All seven other states and territories fall into one of these risk categories. The ACT, NT and Tasmania are classified as medium risk; Queensland and SA are classified as high risk; and NSW and Victoria are classified as extreme risk. Approved travellers from medium and high risk jurisdictions will need to complete 14 days of self-quarantine upon arrival and undergo PCR testing on days two and 12. Those coming from extreme risk jurisdictions will need to quarantine for 14 days in government-approved quarantine facilities, with testing on days one, five and 13. The hard border also applies to residents of WA looking to return, although residents returning from medium risk jurisdictions may be eligible for an exemption on compassionate grounds. All travellers to WA must have a G2G pass, proof of double-dose vaccination and proof of a negative PCR test in the 72 hours before arrival. Plans to ease border restrictions on 5 February are still in place. Fully vaccinated travellers are able to enter the NT provided they fill out a border entry form, have proof of vaccination and have completed a negative PCR test in the three days prior to arriving. If an interstate visitor does not have proof of a negative PCR test, it is required that they complete one within 24 hours of arriving. Travellers will also be given two rapid antigen tests when they arrive in the NT; the first is to be administered within three days and the second on day six. Unvaccinated visitors may not enter the territory. Unvaccinated NT residents or those with an exemption can enter, but will need to complete 14 days of supervised quarantine at their own cost Travel is allowed from all other states and territories for those who are fully vaccinated. All travellers to Tasmania are required to complete registration and have proof of vaccination. If coming from an area deemed high risk, fully vaccinated travellers must have a negative PCR test in the 72 hours leading up to arrival. This rule also applies to Tasmanian residents who have spent more than seven days in a high risk area. Tasmanians who have spent less than seven days in a high risk area will need to be tested within 72 hours of returning. Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, has indicated that there will be an update on the possibility of allowing rapid antigen tests for travellers alongside PCR tests after Thursday’s national cabinet meeting.

12/30/2021,"The Australian government may call in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to crackdown on the price-gouging of rapid antigen tests amid reports the kits have doubled in price as stock disappears from shelves. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday in which he announced national cabinet would convene on Thursday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, pushed back against calls from unions and business groups for the commonwealth to source and distribute rapid tests for free to people across the nation.  He said testing was the states’ “job” and he was “glad they’re doing it”. With some Australians waiting several hours to get a free PCR test and several days to get the result, demand for rapid antigen tests has grown dramatically and prices have risen in turn. Some consumers claimed one retailer appeared to be selling the same five-test kit online for $90 on Wednesday, up from $45 last week. Asked if was there anything to stop retailers gouging prices, Morrison appeared to suggest the consumer watchdog could address the issue. He said that was “something I know the treasurer would be pursuing with the ACCC”. “That’s their job,” Morrison said. “In the same way they do that across many other areas of critical supplies. And anyone who is doing that, they should be reporting that to the ACCC. And I would encourage them to do that. “And that’s something I know the treasurer would be moving on with the chair of the ACCC if someone was seeking to do something of that nature.” A spokesperson for the ACCC said the body could “publicly call out” suppliers caught exploiting the shortage. “The ACCC will investigate any evidence of price collusion and take appropriate action,” the spokesperson said. “The ACCC can publicly call out any suppliers which seem to be exploiting the shortage of rapid antigen tests. “Under the Competition and Consumer Act excessive pricing may, in certain circumstances, constitute unconscionable conduct. Any such case would need to be ultimately decided by a court.” Some manufacturers warned in October, a month before rapid tests became available in chemists, that Australia was likely to face price hikes due to a supply crunch. The Pharmacy Guild also said this week that limited supply and supply chain costs could lead to higher prices for consumers. Amid the consumer complaints of increased prices, some observers pointed to an obscure New South Wales law, repealed in 2019, that a former state fair trading commissioner has said could have prevented price gouging during the pandemic. The state government has previously disputed the claim. Meanwhile, Victoria become the second state pledging to distribute free rapid antigen tests amid price hikes. The health minister, Martin Foley, announced on Wednesday had bought 34m tests and hoped to start handing them out next week, joining NSW which has now ordered 50m and will distribute them from the end of January. Foley said Victoria would buy and provide free tests because the issue had “fallen to the states”. “We would much prefer a national approach … failing that, as per usual the states have had to step up.” Morrison said in response that the federal government’s responsibility on rapid antigen testing was limited to certain settings, such as in residential aged care. But he said the government would commit another $375m to buy further rapid tests for the national stockpile, which might be drawn on to meet gaps at the state level. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison also indicated the federal government was “looking at ways” pensioners might receive concessional access to rapid tests at pharmacies, though he did not give further details. Social service and disability groups have become increasingly concerned that the cost of rapid antigen tests were prohibitive for those on low incomes, including people living with disabilities and elderly people. A pack of five tests would represent 15% of the weekly income of a person on the base rate of the jobseeker payment. President of peak body People With Disability Australia, Samantha Connor, said the federal government should step in to provide rapid tests. “The federal government must urgently provide free rapid antigen testing for people with disability, especially those at risk of severe disease and those with multiple support workers,” Connor said. “Tests and masks should be funded free of charge, have no impact on existing disability funding and available through community pick up points, via mail and from pharmacies.” Connor noted half of all people with disability in Australia lived in poverty. “For many people with disability who have large teams of support workers, it is not feasible to pay $15 a test, especially in a highly casualised workforce,” she said. Connor said there was also mass confusion about whether national disability insurance scheme participants could use their funding to buy rapid antigen tests. A spokesperson for the national disability insurance agency said people in NDIS-funded supported independent living accommodation (SIL) and their providers could claim $12.50 per rapid test. There are about 25,000 SIL participants, but nearly 500,000 people in the NDIS. Some people with disability have also been forced to turn to charities and other mutual aid organisations. The Disability Justice Network, a small grassroots group led by disabled people, said it had provided $2,000 to help people pay for rapid tests since placing a call out online a week and a half ago. “We’ve been getting requests from all over the country,” said Georgia, a Disability Justice Network member who did not want her surname used. “The standard thing we’re doing is transferring people directly $50, which we’ve found is enough to buy a five pack of tests. Some had bought tests and now couldn’t afford groceries, she said, while others could not physically stand in a line for hours for a PCR test, she said. “It’s just a new sudden cost, the prices are going up,” Georgia said. “The DSP or jobseeker payment is just so inadequate.”",News/Australia news,Rapid antigen tests double in price in Australia amid concerns of price-gouging,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/30/rapid-antigen-tests-double-in-price-in-australia-amid-concerns-of-price-gouging
12/30/2021,"Australia could see daily Covid case numbers of more than 100,000 within weeks – lasting for about a month – before new mask and density rules flatten the curve. The prediction, made by Dr Michael Lydeamore, a Monash University infectious diseases modeller who is part of the Doherty Institute modelling consortium that advises Australia’s national cabinet, came as states and territories reported more than 18,000 cases on Wednesday – a pandemic record.  “A month of six figure cases is certainly not outside the realms of possibility across Australia,” Lydeamore said, stressing that modelling is based on “broad and crude assumptions”. He said we could have a month of six-figure infection rates before the outbreak peaks, most likely just after February. Recent models had predicted Covid cases would peak in just over a month’s time. A preliminary University of New South Wales model mentioned by the NSW health minister Brad Hazzard on 15 December predicted up to 25,000 cases a day in that state alone by the end of January. Last Tuesday, there were reports that the Doherty Institute was predicting Australia could have 200,000 new Covid cases a day by late January or early February under a “worst-case scenario”, if no health settings were tightened. However the reintroduction of indoor mask mandates and density limits in various states in recent days means that worst-case scenario models for daily cases are less likely to be reached, Lydeamore said. Instead, infections will be spread further throughout the year with the peak delayed and less severe. “The numbers we are seeing, such as the 11,201 in NSW today, are not in the realm of very high. It can feel very high compared with what we’re used to but it’s a far cry from what it could be soon,” Lydeamore said. He also noted “the restriction levels really mess that up”. “The more restrictions that come in, the later and flatter the curve will be. If absolutely nothing had been done, you would have been thinking January or February as the peak, but we know some restrictions have already come.” Lydeamore said the speed that cases will reach the peak is unclear, but that the fewer restrictions in place, the more that the rate of case decrease after the peak will mirror the rate of increase. “We’re not going to get back down to single digit cases for a very long time. The endemic level of cases will probably be lower than the current level of daily cases we’re seeing now.” Lydeamore also said it was difficult for modellers to factor in how Australians’ attitude to gathering could become more cautious as case numbers surge. Additionally, the speed of the booster rollout and uptake and the effects of natural immunity on reinfection, are variables that could dramatically shape the speed and intensity that the current wave of Covid spreads through the community. On Wednesday, as NSW Dominic Perrottet defended his management of Covid restrictions and health minister Brad Hazzard reiterated that “we’ll all get” Covid, the state’s chief health officer, Kerry Chant, warned the local spread of Omicron could be different to other countries’. “What we know from South Africa is that it’s been quite a massive uptick and then a drop down but there is some science behind that because when you get a certain proportion of the population exposed, you actually boost their immunity and then it almost acts as if you’re boosted with a vaccine through that natural protection. It’s always difficult to draw direct comparisons,” Chant said. Lydeamore also warned that the overwhelmed state of testing systems meant that daily numbers reported this week are likely to be just 80% of actual infections. “The actual number of daily infections in NSW [on Wednesday] is probably closer to 14,000 or 15,000.” “As the testing is stressed, that fraction of cases we detected is likely to drop down, as we just won’t be able to keep testing everyone when you’ve got thousands upon thousands of cases. It’s expensive and time consuming, and you can miss a few hundred and things won’t change much.” Lydeamore said that as cases grow, the number of undetected cases increases, and Covid becomes endemic, modelling in Australia “will pivot to the short term and to situation awareness ”, similar to the way weather forecasts are only made for coming days before accuracy deteriorates and predictions become less useful. Mary-Louise McLaws, a professor of epidemiology at the University of NSW and adviser to the World Health Organization, said she believes the prediction of a peak of six figure case numbers every day for a month could hinge on how governments deal with testing, detection and isolation of Covid from now on. “Factoring in testing times, and if rapid antigen tests are given out for free, could change how you get to the six figure a day for a month prediction,” she said. She noted Lydeamore’s prediction was broad and an estimate, but said that while most modelling provides a worst-case scenario, some predictions can also be the best case because some inputs for the model can change.",News/Australia news,"Australia’s daily Covid cases could rise to 100,000 within weeks, expert predicts",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/30/australias-daily-covid-cases-could-rise-to-100000-within-weeks-expert-predicts
12/30/2021,"Best case scenario: A packed AAMI Park lifts Australia’s men to a thumping win over Vietnam in January and kick-starts a run that, combined with Japan collapsing, and an already-qualified Saudi Arabia putting their cue in the rack, culminates in automatic qualification for the Qatar 2022 World Cup. At that tournament, a favourable draw allows a unit led by a new generation of stars in Daniel Arzani, Harry Souttar, Ajdin Hrustic, Denis Genreau, Riley McGree, and Nathaniel Atkinson to win their first World Cup game since 2010 and remain in the mix to progress to the knockout stages heading into the final minutes of group action.  Worst case scenario: The Socceroos’ lean run of form continues and disastrous defeats to Oman, Japan and Saudi Arabia in World Cup qualification see them fall to fourth in their qualification group and miss out on the biggest stage for the first time since 2002. Peter Cklamovski, Mark Rudan, and Hervé Renard all reject Football Australia’s offer to replace Graham Arnold, leading the desperate federation to appoint Ole Gunnar Solskjær as the new coach. and neglect to perform a full review of the national team programs. What will probably happen: Japan hold on to second place in Group B, forcing Australia into a playoff with the third-place finisher in Group A and then a one-game intercontinental playoff against fifth-placed CONMEBOL finisher Chile. Graham Arnold’s legacy as Socceroos boss becomes intrinsically tied to that result. Best case scenario: Tony Gustavsson’s experimentation bears fruit as the Matildas romp to an Asian Cup win in January. Combined with an influx of standout ALW players, Australia show demonstrable signs of growth in subsequent friendlies against some of the world’s best. The Matildas are now a major contender to lift the World Cup on home soil in 2023, Gustavsson feels comfortable enough with his depth to rest key contributors such as Sam Kerr and Ellie Carpenter. Worst case scenario: The Matildas are stunned by South Korea in the quarterfinals of the Asian Cup and their defensive and midfield issues show little sign of improvement in friendlies against the world’s best throughout the rest of the year. Frustrated, Gustavsson resigns from his post and again takes up a position as an assistant with the United States Women’s National Team, with Football Australia pursuing Phil Neville as his replacement. What will probably happen: Flashes of a soft underbelly remain stubbornly persistent despite the Matildas setting up a heavyweight meeting with Japan in the Asian Cup final and riding an emotional wave to one of their trademark big-game performances. The team shows some signs of improvement in later friendlies as the standouts from Gustavsson’s early experimentation establish themselves and senior figures are welcomed back to the side. But vexing questions still remain heading into 2023. Best case scenario: Battling player absences due to Covid, ALM coaches are forced to rely on younger players, and their exuberance inspires the league to shake off its conservatism and embrace an entertaining brand of football. Off the pitch, Western United commences construction of its stadium, Macarthur FC works with stakeholders to lower ticket prices and get more fans through the gate, Western Sydney Wanderers finally start playing like the big team they say they are, and Daniel Sturridge turns out for a full 90 minutes for Perth Glory. Worst case scenario: Rising Covid cases force the league into a two-week hiatus that promptly becomes a one-month, then a two-month, and then ultimately a three-month suspension in play. When play does resume, a significant number of the higher profile names have fled overseas and coaches, as a result, adopt even more pragmatic tactics. The games themselves are poorly attended, lacking in spectacle, and lost in a sea of AFL and NRL coverage. Elsewhere, Western United announce plans to play out of Gippsland in 2022-23, Macarthur FC reveal a new ultra-mega platinum ticket package, Western Sydney Wanderers appoint Paolo Di Canio as coach only for him to quit after two weeks, and Daniel Sturridge drops a diss track on the A-Leagues after returning to Britain. What will probably happen: ALM continues to battle onward in the face of rising Covid cases, with the gulf widening between the better resourced clubs and the rest. With the exception of the Newcastle Jets, teams continue to remain pragmatic in approach in the face of these challenges but ratings-hungry league officials are buoyed when City and Victory set up a grand final Melbourne derby for the first time since South Melbourne faced Carlton in the NSL. Best case scenario: Buoyed by the Matildas lifting the Asian Cup with a number of its stars playing key roles, and excitement building over the 2023 Women’s World Cup, ALW continues to establish itself in the public consciousness and increasingly challenges for the mantle of the highest quality women’s league in Australian sport. Caught up in this anticipation, and the prospect of winning the first ever Club Championship, fans of ALM sides increasingly flock to watch their club’s women’s team compete and several set attendance records by the end of the season. Encouraged by these signs of progress and bolstered by their investment from Silver Lake, the Australian Professional Leagues reveal a roadmap to a full home and away season and year-round professionalism on the eve of the Grand Final, as well as plans for each club to create comprehensive youth development programs. Worst case scenario: With Covid showing no signs of abating, ALW is forced into a long hiatus that, due to its players not being full-time professionals, results in a number stepping away from the game in order to support themselves and their families. When the league does resume, Western Australia’s continuing border restrictions result in Perth Glory withdrawing for the remainder of the campaign. The league announces that in the wake of this uncertainty that Western United and Central Coast Mariners entry into the competition will be delayed, which weeks later is followed by the news that the Brisbane Lions have convinced Mary Fowler to switch codes and play AFLW. What will probably happen: ALW soldiers on and is able to complete the season in the face of Omicron-shaped headwinds, even if the pandemic prevents the league from experiencing the growth that would have been hoped heading into the season. Nonetheless, in the form of players such as City’s Holly McNamara, new young stars continue to emerge on the road to 2023. Sydney FC finally get the monkey off their back, defeating City in the Grand Final to become champions. Best case scenario: Football Australia announces the launch of a ten-team, fully home-and-away national second division in 2023 that will expand to 16 teams in the following years by promoting the best-performing sides in the National Premier Leagues that meet strict financial and infrastructural requirements. Full promotion and relegation with the tiers below are revealed to be commencing when the 16 team mark is reached. Worst case scenario: Football Australia announces the launch of a conference-based national second division in 2023 which will feature NPL champions from each state, new franchises and a minimum number of ALM youth sides in a Champions League format – eliminating the possibility of promotion and relegation with the lower NPL tiers. Disgusted, a number of NPL clubs break away from Football Australia and attempt to establish their own rebel competition but, without the logistical support of the national federation, it quickly collapses – taking a number of Australia’s most historic clubs with it. What will probably happen: Football Australia announces a national second division will launch in 2023. Everyone agrees that it’s an important step forward for the Australian game but nobody is left happy because, depending on who you talk to, it has gone too far and will inevitably collapse / hasn’t gone far enough and will inevitably collapse. Best case scenario: In the wake of the Matildas becoming champions of Asia once again, the 2023 Women’s World Cup becomes an unlikely vote-winner in the 2022 federal election with both sides of politics making commitments to pour significant money into the growth and support of elite and grassroots football across Australia. Riding a wave of momentum, excitement for the coming World Cup leads to a surge in participation from both girls and boys across the nation with tickets for all the tournament’s games becoming some of the most eagerly sought after in Australian sporting history. Worst case scenario: Taking advantage of the Matildas’ continued sputtering form and an undermanned Football Australia, rival sporting codes successfully move to suck the oxygen out of the room, marginalise the build-up to 2023 and lobby for government funding to be disproportionately directed towards supporting their own causes. A new variant of Covid emerges, casting doubts on the ability of Australia and New Zealand to welcome fans from all around the world to celebrate the marquee event without onerous quarantine requirements. What will probably happen: At least three Matildas friendlies against high-profile opposition are played to record crowds across Australia. Grassroots, community, and NPL competitions get a full season in after two disrupted years. And the successful addition of Western and Central Coast to the ALW continues to give the women’s game in Australia some level of momentum. This, combined with favourable coverage from mainstream media (in spite of any wobbles in the Matildas’ form) leads to steady growth in hype for 2023, with ticket sales anticipated to be very strong when they go on sale.",Sport/Football,What will happen in Australian football in 2022?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/29/what-will-happen-in-australian-football-in-2022
12/30/2021,"For climate change in Australia, 2021 was the year of the bullshit absolution narrative. The wide grin of a promise of good, with a bag of sinister held behind the back. This was 2021’s grubby climate through-line. The first tactic deployed to protect the fossil fuel industry, organised denial of the science proving the link between greenhouse gas emissions and global heating, was terribly impactful. Though we’ve stamped that out, the space has been filled by a more effective and insidious problem: climate delay. This refers to a suite of spurious arguments used to justify not reducing emissions at all, or reducing them at as slow a rate as possible. You’ve heard these before – they include pleas to wait for better technology, redirecting responsibility to others or emphasising the downsides of action.  In Australia, in 2021, governments, corporations, lobbyists, media companies and marketing firms engaged in a weird kind of convergent rhyme. They each realised that a deeply concerned citizenry must be distracted, and the people power that emerged in the 2019 climate marches defused. So, they poured their efforts into figuring out how to best lie about acting on climate (instead of the easier and cheaper option of actually acting on climate). The most obvious example is the conservative Coalition government in Australia. They’ve used the old approach of hollow techno-optimism to mask the total absence of real-world emissions reductions, repackaged this year within the loophole-ridden “net zero” marketing framework. The target of a 26% reduction by 2030 is an international embarrassment. Official government projections show that without any effort at all, emissions will fall by around 30%, due mostly to the growth of renewables (in a grim moment, this was rebranded as an escalation in ambition, and tricks were used to tweak the figure to 35%). The federal government has explicitly incentivised new fossil fuel projects – funding gas power plants, and helping coal and gas mines get off the ground. But in parallel, Australia’s diplomatic forces overseas ran an organised campaign of greenwashing, twisting emissions data to falsely present the country’s past performance and future targets as ambitious, culminating in the Cop26 conference in Glasgow. The government’s insincerity isn’t well obscured. Scott Morrison danced with literal joy when a gas field with unlocked emissions equivalent to 15 coal plants cleared a major hurdle. Less obvious and far less acknowledged is how pervasive the tactics of climate delay have sunk within other players in Australia’s climate debate. The Labor party announced that they were revising down their previous 2030 target of 45% (which they took to the 2019 election) to 43%. That prior target was itself sourced from a report published in 2015, which recommended between 40% and 60%. While the renewable energy parts of Labor’s plan are respectable, the industry sector elements leave a wide range of questions open enough for high emitters to exploit to their advantage. Their trajectory to 2030 relies just as heavily as the Coalition’s 2050 net zero plan on the purchase of offsets instead of emissions reductions. Both major parties fail to include any controls to ensure that companies aren’t just buying up cheap, dodgy offsets instead of reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. Labor also plans to adopt and reform the Coalition’s loophole-ridden “safeguard mechanism” policy, with little clarity on exactly how that reform will take place. Major emitters and fossil lobby groups cautiously welcomed Labor’s plan while laying down the language to frame any real emissions reductions as dangerous or destructive. Labor’s policy was sold as a bottom-up, realist approach. In reality, it leaned heavily on the Business Council of Australia’s policy suggestions, leaving gaps and loopholes that could easily be widened into major climate failure by motivated high-emitters. Running defence for the political delayers and Australia’s worst corporate emitters was News Corp, who wrapped their verifiably awful record on climate in a veil of revisionist greenwashing. Mirroring both major parties, articles like “What polluters are doing to help” serve as the public relations engine of this wider narrative of fabricated action. Rarely acknowledged is the group of marketing and public relations firms getting paid eye-watering sums to churn out climate delay, exposed jointly by CommsDeclare and Clean Creatives. I know we were broken down by an exhausting decade of climate denial. But that exhaustion has created a hopeful credulity. A vulnerability to under-interrogating these glossy stories of reformation. Stop fighting, we asked. Please, end the “climate wars”. Well, they did. Both major parties and industry are in peaceful agreement to fail badly on domestic emissions while extracting planet-wrecking quantities of carbon so it can be burned overseas. The future can only lie in kicking big, destructive holes in the wall of false reassurances and disinformation used to delay climate action. It was easy to spot wide-eyed climate deniers. Can you spot a net zero target packed with backloading and offsets? You need to. I know that Australia’s politicians and fossil fuel executives watched the gut-wrenching black summer bushfire crisis, the same as I and much of the world did. They watched the deep-red skies in the shaky smartphone footage, and the exhausted firefighters collapsing on the streets. Maybe their hearts dropped in their chests when they briefly came face to face with the consequences of unbridled emissions and a heating planet. Two years on, we know for sure that their only real, lingering response was to scramble to figure out new ways to lie about the damage they’re doing. In 2022, we need to reignite the climate wars and fight back against the deadly cult of delay.

12/30/2021,"Officially the new year parties in Australia’s largest cities will go ahead as planned, despite Covid case numbers exploding around the country. But the night seems set to be much quieter than usual, as individuals dampen their plans, rethinking trips to the usual hotspots in Sydney and Melbourne, and cancelling larger parties or putting caps on numbers, amid warnings from epidemiologists that the night could become a super-spreader event.  There were 11,201 positive cases reported in New South Wales on Wednesday and 3,767 in Victoria, with South Australia and Queensland also both well over 1,000. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, has urged people to head out and enjoy the party and large crowds are expected to watch the famous fireworks in Sydney. The City of Sydney said it could not predict how many people would turn out, but five of the six locations it manages were sold out, with about 17,000 tickets booked. Tickets were still on sale on Wednesday for 25 other locations, with capacity for almost 87,000 people. But many private businesses are shutting up shop. One of Sydney’s biggest dance parties, Mad Racket, has cancelled its New Year’s Day event, which was originally set to draw a crowd of 400. “I already had a lot of people I was giving refunds to because people are becoming uncomfortable,” co-founder Simon Caldwell said. “The general vibe was safer to [shut down] than not do it. For people to wear masks indoors when they’re dancing, it’s not the vibe.” He said the suppliers and venue had lost money, but that it was a safer option. “It’s not about shaming anyone who is going ahead, everyone had to make their own call – which sort of made it more difficult in a way because it wasn’t clearcut.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Neesha Chockalingam, 21, had planned to go dancing in Sydney for New Year’s Eve, but one person in her friendship group caught Covid last week, so now they were winding it back to a small party in the park. “We made the decision last week when one of us got Covid,” Chockalingam said. “It ruined our plans because we’re a close friend group, we didn’t want to do it without him. “There’ll be probably not more than five to 10 people. It’ll be small scale.” Melbourne revellers are also weighing up their options. Many are expected to flock to Flagstaff Gardens, Treasury Gardens, and Docklands to watch the fireworks, but some have had second thoughts. . Savannah Benson lives in Canberra but had planned to spend New Year’s Eve with a friend in Melbourne. They made a pact – if Victoria’s case numbers hit 2,000 a day they would cancel the trip. “It was less a concern about actually catching Covid because we both live in Canberra so the risk is there anyway, but more so uncertainty over what would happen if we caught it or became a close contact,” she said. Elliot, who did not want his last name to be used, lives in Tamworth, NSW, with his young family. They had planned to have a large party with extended family and friends, but cut it to an intimate gathering after seeing the case numbers rise. “Now we are down to the micro-bubble of immediate family,” he said. “If it had not been this ridiculousness it would have been a much bigger family and friends party.” He said it was hard to act in your own health interests when there was so much Covid in the state. “I wish our commonwealth and state government would prioritise the health outcomes of its citizens rather than the economic outlook of the state.” Prof Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist and adviser to the World Health Organization, said it would be “disappointing” if the two governments let their public celebrations go ahead. “I would have expected the authorities to do leadership during hard times and that leadership means trying to save people from infection,” she said. “They’ve had months to understand Australia has a super-spreader event this time of year. The same thing happened last year. “If there is a circulating virus the same thing will happen next year. This is part of outbreak management. I am shocked at the lack of planning to slow down the outbreak.” McLaws said there should also be caps on home visits. “There need to be home capacity limits and, in fact, everyone going to a home should certainly be using a [rapid antigen test] if they all haven’t recently had a booster shot.” She said parties should be moved outside and those attending should wear masks at all times. “And if you can’t risk staying at home because you’re too unwell [in the coming weeks] to go to work, then maybe think about enjoying a celebration from home with your household. Think about it very carefully.”",News/Australia news,Australia’s New Year’s Eve may be a damp squib as revellers make their own Covid decisions,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/30/australias-new-years-eve-may-be-a-damp-squib-as-revellers-make-their-own-covid-decisions
12/30/2021,"On a sunny Melbourne afternoon, the perfect temperature for repeatedly but cheerfully embarrassing oneself on a surfboard, I hop into the car and head in the opposite direction to the ocean. Following signs to Melbourne airport, I eventually arrive at Urbnsurf Melbourne, a turquoise pool that generates pristine artificial waves.  The lagoon is an impressive two hectares in total, about the size of the MCG playing field. It’s an unusual location for a surf: located in Tullamarine, the facility is only a few minutes down the road from planes and runways. The pools of peeling waves – one breaking left, the other right – are divided by a central barrier. There are six of us here for a “cruiser” lesson, where we will surf green, or unbroken, waves. Our instructor, Julian Goyma, is a musician and music teacher by trade, but also an avid surfer and instructor on the side. The lesson, which costs $99 on weekdays and $109 on weekends, includes board and wetsuit hire. On land, we stretch and practise our pop-ups, and Goyma gives pointers on timing and technique, which I promptly forget about as soon as we are in the water. Our hour-long session in the lagoon promises us at least 10 to 12 waves each. In the ocean, where conditions are not so consistent, Goyma says it might take three hours to catch as many good waves. I am nervous: I have previously surfed a few times in Queensland, but only on tiny waves. On the cruiser setting, the waves have a face height of one metre. We paddle out, single file, to “The Point”, where the waves are generated – in sets of six at the beginning of our session, and later in sets of 10. An underlying rip that pulls towards The Point makes the paddling process far easier than it normally feels in the ocean. The rule at Urbnsurf is one surfer per wave, which on the upside means that there is no competitive jostling, but also creates the effect of spectacle, where the audience are all excellent surfers. I should be able to do this, I think, waiting in the line-up. I’m relatively active! I’m half-decent on a snowboard! I’m … falling face first into a wall of chlorinated water. Surfing is meditative, Goyma tells me later. When he has a lot on his mind he will sometimes get to work early and surf for a few hours before his shift starts. “It’s a really good release.” It isn’t exactly cheap, though. Purchasing your own surfing gear secondhand can lower the costs, Goyma says. “You can kit yourself out for probably $500, but you could spend up to $1,500 or $2,000 for a top-of-the-line board and a top-of-the-line wetsuit.” The adjective I would use to describe my session is exhausting – mainly because I lack what surfing websites call “paddle fitness”. “You look tired already,” Goyma says, about a third of the way into the session. I pant in the affirmative, miffed that my extensive preparations for this activity – a single 1km swim in a lap pool and some sporadic push ups – have been to no avail. We happen to be surfing at the same time as Damon Tudor, Urbnsurf’s chief executive, and his young son, whose skill level is already unattainably impressive. Tudor, who lives in Sydney, grew up surfing in the ocean but sees Urbnsurf as a way to introduce the sport “to people that are maybe not as confident in the ocean as they would be in a controlled environment like this”. Urbnsurf’s progressive lesson pathway caters for all skill levels, he says. Learn-to-surf and beginner sessions – which start around $69 to $79 – are held in the shallower part of the lagoon, while sessions with wave heights up to two metres cater to advanced surfers. The clientele is a mix of both one-off visitors and regulars. “Some people come in once a fortnight, some people come in twice a week,” Goyma says. Like with any skill, how fast you progress (that is, how quickly you stop embarrassing yourself) depends on the amount of time spent. “We had someone who’d never surfed before – it’s actually one of the staff – and they were surfing in the advanced session after six weeks,” Goyma says. “I prefer surfing in the ocean for the [overall] experience, being in nature,” he says. But he’s partial to the wave pool for advancing in ability or working on specific skills. “Because it’s so predictable.” Despite countless wipeouts, I am in good spirits at the end of the lesson. My arms feel heavy but my mind is clear – perhaps it was meditative after all.

12/30/2021,"An email from Tennis Australia, offering television networks footage of defending champion Naomi Osaka’s arrival in Melbourne, arrived midway through Tuesday. Even for a country renowned for celebrating the arrival of any international celebrity with a chorus of publicity, the sight of the Japanese superstar on the tarmac was a welcome relief.  The recent Covid-19 spike has added insult and uncertainty to the injuries that have already ruled legends Serena Williams and Roger Federer out of the Australian Open. If this year’s grand slam was unprecedented, next month’s edition is shaping as another tournament of great apprehension given the pandemic is heating up yet again. Former finalist and US Open champion Dominic Thiem withdrew Wednesday with a wrist problem. Three of this year’s women’s semi-finalists, led by Williams, are out injured. Karolína Plíšková, who played a ripper of a Wimbledon final against Ash Barty, will miss, as will former US Open finalist Kei Nishikori, the high-profile compatriot of Osaka. Rafael Nadal is in Spain recovering from a Covid-19 infection contracted at an exhibition in Abu Dhabi last week that has now seen five positives among a small group of players, including Russian contender Andrey Rublev. It is not yet clear whether Nadal, the 2009 Australian Open champion, will be at Melbourne Park, but local officials are quietly confident the 20-time major winner will travel. Five-time Australian Open finalist Andy Murray, who attended the UAE exhibition, arrived on Wednesday after receiving a wildcard into next month’s grand slam. As for Novak Djokovic, the undisputed king of Melbourne Park, there is no certainty at all regarding his presence at the Australian Open. Late on Wednesday he pulled out of the ATP Cup, due to begin in Sydney on New Year’s Day. For every breathless report about the Serbian, there is no clarity as to whether the nine-time Australian Open champion is vaccinated or not. Little wonder then at the excitement and relief surrounding the arrival of the four-time major champion Osaka, whose return after a mental health break provides a boost of star power. Tournament organisers pulled off tennis’s version of a miracle in February, with players chartered into the country and quarantined before being unleashed on the courts of Melbourne Park. Successfully negotiating the threat posed by the Omicron variant for the summer of 2022 is providing challenges that are no less complex and stressful. While questions abound about the participation of some big names, there is ample evidence to state those who actually get to the baseline possess more than enough punch to ensure another quality edition of the Happy Slam. The US Open proved a clear illustration, with the success of Emma Raducanu, and her final against Leylah Fernandez, prompting stunning television ratings in America and abroad. Daniil Medvedev, the US Open champion and a finalist in Melbourne in February, is clearly a leading title threat after dismantling Djokovic in New York. Alexander Zverev peaked at the ATP Finals when defeating Medvedev and seems certain to break his duck at a major sooner rather than later. The interest and expectation surrounding Barty in her bid to break an Australian Open drought by locals dating back to the success of Chris O’Neil in 1980 is enough to ensure a high-level of patriotic interest. The world No.1 practised on Rod Laver Arena with Billie Jean King Cup teammate Sam Stosur on Wednesday and will head to Adelaide for a tournament next week. She carries star billing for a WTA Tour event in Sydney in the week prior to the year’s first major. Clips of players practising against mattresses laid up against the wall of their hotel rooms heralded an unusual and enormously expensive Australia Open in 2021. The conditions will be less onerous this year, with an extended stint in quarantine reserved solely for those who test positive. But it is certain some will be hindered. The threat posed by Omicron has the potential to wreak havoc on draws over the next month in Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne. Already Canadian star Denis Shapovalov is serving a 10-day stint in Sydney. Frenchman Benoit Paire announced he is positive again on Wednesday. Others are certain to follow suit. Officials are trying to minimise risk. So, too, star players. Some will stay in homes, with an agent of a leading player telling Guardian Australia that contact with the star will be restricted to a small handful of people over the next month. The majority of players will stay in what Tennis Australia has dubbed a “minimised risk environment” at Crown Hotels, though they will be free to move about Melbourne. Unlike last February, entire plane loads of players will not have to serve strict quarantine should a person aboard a flight to Australia test positive. But it was somewhat surprising to see photos of players on a flight from South America mixing freely and mask-free over a card game given what is at stake. The majority of the 17 flights bringing stars to Australia have now arrived. Another few are scheduled to arrive from late next week for those who are not playing in the events on offer in suburban and regional Australia. For all the optimism, perhaps the only sure thing about the month ahead is the lack of certainty.",Sport/Sport,Naomi Osaka adds star power to uncertain Australian Open build-up | Courtney Walsh,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/30/naomi-osaka-adds-star-power-to-nervy-australian-open-build-up
