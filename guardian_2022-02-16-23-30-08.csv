2/16/2022,"Students at five leading universities have filed legal complaints accusing their colleges of breaking a little-known law by investing in the fossil fuel companies responsible for the climate emergency. The students from Yale, MIT, Princeton, Stanford and Vanderbilt wrote to the attorneys general of their respective states on Wednesday asking authorities to investigate breaches of the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act, which requires universities to invest in a manner consistent with their “charitable purposes”.  The novel legal strategy, developed with lawyers from the Climate Defense Project, argues that the law imposes a legal duty to put the public interest first and that their universities, among the wealthiest and most prestigious colleges in the country, are failing to do so by investing in fossil fuel companies that cause damage to the environment and health. In addition, the complaints say that investments in coal, oil and gas are not financially responsible, as required by the law, because the industries have an uncertain future. The five universities together have total endowment funds of about $150bn, although only a small part is invested in fossil fuel companies. In their letter to Tennessee’s attorney general, Herbert Slatery, students, faculty and alumni at Vanderbilt University accused the college’s board of trustees of breaching its duties with investments from its $10bn endowment. “We ask that you investigate this conduct and use your enforcement powers to bring the Board of Trust’s investment practices into compliance with its fiduciary obligations,” the letter said. Hannah Reynolds, an anthropology student and co-coordinator of Divest Princeton, said the group filed the complaint after her university failed to act on earlier proposals to shed investments in fossil fuel companies. “There’s been nine years of fossil fuel divestment organising at Princeton and no commitment or action by Princeton. We’ve exercised every option, we’ve made every argument that we can, and Princeton hasn’t taken it seriously,” she said. Reynolds accused the university of stalling by having various panels and committees review divestment proposals, only to see them recommend contradictory actions that limit the scale of action. Last year, Princeton’s board of trustees announced it would divest from coal and tar sands but not oil and gas. Aaditi Lele, an organiser of the divestment campaign at Vanderbilt University, said students there faced a similar struggle. “Every time we ask them about fossil fuel divestment, they refer back to other actions that they’re taking to make the campus itself greener, such as carbon offsets, but they fail to address actual divestment. A lot of what they do is just greenwashing through mentioning those other actions and then using that as justification to pretend that that’s enough,” she said. Students at the five universities coordinated their action following similar initiatives Harvard and Cornell, which both subsequently announced they would shed fossil fuel investments. “We’ve seen other schools, specifically Harvard and Cornell, take the same approach,” said Reynolds. “Within months, both of those schools have divested. So our hope is that by taking this action, that maybe this will finally be taken seriously.” The students are also seeking to put pressure on their universities by drawing public attention to their continued financial involvement with the coal, oil and gas industries. Asked why the student groups asked state attorneys general to investigate instead of pursuing direct legal action, Reynolds said it was a question of resources. “Princeton is a university with a $39bn endowment, so they really have a lot of resources that we don’t have. I’m sure that they would be able to hire the lawyers to defend them in a way that would be much more difficult for us. We don’t have any funding or anything. It’s a bunch of volunteers in our campaign,” she said. Four of the universities are in states with Democratic attorneys general and their students expect at least a sympathetic hearing. Vanderbilt is in Tennessee, where Slatery is a Republican. But campaigners note that he declined to join 27 other states in a lawsuit against President Barack Obama’s policies to mitigate the climate crisis. Lele said the environmental crisis had not passed Tennessee by. The state was hit by catastrophic flash flooding last year that killed 20 people and damaged hundreds of homes. “Environmental degradation and its impacts have really been at the forefront of the conversation. So we’re hopeful that the political affiliations of the state don’t impede their understandings of the gravity of the situation,” she said.",News/Environment,Students’ complaint argues it’s illegal for US universities to invest in fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/16/us-universities-fossil-fuel-divestment-students-legal-complaint
2/16/2022,"Joe Biden has delivered another blow to Donald Trump’s efforts to keep secret his actions around the time of the deadly January 6 Capitol insurrection by refusing to exert executive privilege over the former president’s White House visitor logs, according to a report published on Wednesday. The president has directed the National Archives to turn over the records within 15 days to the House committee investigating the attack by Trump supporters as a “in the light of the urgency” of the panel’s work, the New York Times says.  Trump had insisted that details of who visited him in the White House were protected by executive privilege, a claim identical to the one Biden rejected last year over hundreds of pages of documents, including call logs, daily presidential diaries, handwritten notes and memos from aides. Trump took that case to appeal but lost in the supreme court last month. The investigation by the House select committee has become increasingly focused on Trump’s Oval Office in recent weeks as it also attempts to unravel his efforts to overturn his defeat by Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Knowledge of who visited the White House and when is seen as crucial to the panel’s inquiry, following recent revelations that a “war room” of Trump insiders, including his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, was set up to plot ways to try to prevent Biden from taking office. Trump, meanwhile, continues to expound the big lie that his election defeat was fraudulent as he mulls his decision to run again in 2024. Biden’s decision to reject the privilege claim came on Monday in a letter to the National Archives by the White House counsel, Dana Remus, the NYT reported. The letter stated that Biden had considered Trump’s claim that because he was president at the time of the attack on the US Capitol the records should remain private, but determined that it was “not in the best interest of the United States” to do so, the Associated Press reported. Echoing arguments given in Biden’s previous rejection of executive privilege claims, Remus said that “Congress has a compelling need” to see the documents judiciously, and that “constitutional protections of executive privilege should not be used to shield, from Congress or the public, information that reflects a clear and apparent effort to subvert the Constitution itself”, the Times account states. The newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the letter sent on Tuesday to David Ferriero, the official archivist of the US, and that the White House planned to notify Trump’s lawyers on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if Trump will appeal the decision legally given his earlier supreme court defeat. The bipartisan House panel has interviewed dozens of witnesses and reviewed thousands of documents as it tries to untangle the events following Trump’s defeat, with the waters beginning to lap at the doors of the former president’s Oval Office. Members on both sides insisted at the weekend that they expected Giuliani, who has so far resisted efforts to appear, to give what could be crucial testimony. The former New York mayor and Trump adviser has been implicated in an alleged plot to seize voting machines in several contested states. Other key Trumpworld insiders have refused to cooperate with the committee, including the former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The House of Representatives recommended criminal contempt charges for Meadows in December, and Bannon pleaded not guilty to a contempt of Congress charge in November. Others from the Trump administration have been more talkative, with aides close to Mike Pence, the former vice-president, providing evidence. Pence has become embroiled in a public dispute with his former boss, openly rebutting Trump’s false claims that he had the power to refuse to certify Biden’s victory. According to Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the January 6 panel, public hearings could begin in the spring or summer, as the clock ticks towards November’s midterm elections and a likely shutting down of the inquiry by any new Republican House majority. Pressure is mounting on Trump, who is facing at least 19 separate legal challenges, according to a Guardian tally this month. The Washington Post reported last week that Trump took boxes of records, including top secret documents, to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida retreat, when he left office, in possible violation of government record-keeping laws. And an upcoming book from New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman claims that Trump periodically clogged White House toilets by attempting to flush away printed papers. Trump has denied the allegations.",News/US news, Biden orders release of Trump White House visitor logs to January 6 panel,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/16/trump-white-house-visitor-logs-capitol-attack-biden
2/16/2022,"A self-styled eco-terrorist who planted a viable homemade bomb in a popular public park in central Edinburgh has been jailed for more than eight years. Nikolaos Karvounakis, originally from the Greek island of Crete, had placed the improvised device packed with 58 nails and sections of metal pipe in a shelter at Princes Street Gardens in January 2018.  Written on the flap inside the box were the words “fuck you all”. The device included low grade explosive, and a primitive but disconnected fuse made from a light filament and a battery. Army explosives experts believed that had it been made operational or accidentally detonated, it would have been capable of causing significant injuries, the high court in Edinburgh heard. Karvounakis later claimed to be linked to a fringe group accused of eco-terrorism which originated in Mexico. It took nearly two years before Karvounakis, 35, a former Greek national serviceman, was arrested. In December 2020 Police Scotland counter-terrorism officers received intelligence from European counterparts linking him to the offence. DNA taken from tape used in the device was found to belong to him. Six weeks after the device was found, the Edinburgh Evening News received an email headed “International Terrorist Group in UK”. It contained a link to an extremist website where Karvounakis had anonymously claimed responsibility with a picture of the device and signed “Misanthropos Cacogen”. Speaking for the prosecution, Angela Gray, the advocate depute, said Karvounakis claimed to be a “lover of nihilist anti-political violence” and to support an anarchist terror group Individualidades Tendiendo a lo Salvaje. The group has been blamed for bombing a nano-technology lab in Mexico City in 2011 that seriously injured a robotics researcher. Gray told the court: “This is known as ITS, an abbreviation of a Spanish phrase translating to ‘individualists tending to the wild’. This Mexican terrorist organisation was formed during 2011. The group focuses on eco-terrorism, which involves acts of violence committed against people and or property in support of environmental causes.” John Scullion QC, Karvounakis’s defence counsel, said he had been struggling with anxiety and low self-esteem, and had spent increasing amounts of time online. There he had drifted into conversations with extremists, whose beliefs he now repudiated. Scullion said his client, who pleaded guilty to an offence under the Terrorism Act, had intended to cause disruption but had not planned to injure people, so had left the detonator unconnected. “It is fair to say he now bitterly regrets what he did and will bitterly regret it for the rest of his life,” Scullion told the court. Lord Braid jailed Karvounakis for eight years and four months, and said he would have been jailed for 10 years had he not admitted his guilt and had no previous convictions. “The offence involved a high degree of culpability on your part as shown by the significant degree of planning,” the judge said. “Afterwards you appeared to exult in the commission in your claim of responsibility.” Det Chief Supt Stuart Houston, Police Scotland’s head of counter-terrorism, said: “The ideological beliefs held by Karvounakis were unusual. “His reckless actions showed utter disregard for the safety of anyone within Princes Street Gardens [and] there is no doubt his presence and engagement online after the event could have easily encouraged others to carry out similar acts, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Not just in Scotland.”",News/UK news,‘Eco-terrorist’ who planted bomb in Edinburgh park jailed,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/16/eco-terrorist-who-planted-bomb-in-edinburgh-park-jailed
2/16/2022,"France’s nightclubs reopen for the first time in three months on Wednesday and the Netherlands returns to “almost normal” from next Friday, as European countries continue to lift their coronavirus curbs despite relatively high infection numbers. Groups may also play to standing audiences in French concert venues, customers in bars and cafes will be allowed to eat and drink while standing at the counter and cinemagoers and train passengers can snack during their film or journey.  “The skies seem finally to be clearing,” said the French government’s official spokesperson, Gabriel Attal, adding that restrictions “can be lifted according to schedule” but urging people to continue to exercise caution and restraint. France is due to drop its rule mandating face masks in indoor public spaces that require a vaccine pass, such as restaurants, cinemas and gyms, on 28 February, although the obligation will remain on public transport and in shops. The health minister, Olivier Véran, said on Wednesday all remaining mask rules could be lifted and vaccine pass rules “significantly eased” by mid-March, “providing infection numbers continue to fall and the pressure on our hospitals permits”. Nightclubs and bars in the Netherlands can also open until 1am from this Friday, the health minister, Ernst Kuipers, said, before all limits on opening hours are lifted on 25 February. “Young people should be able to unleash their wings,” Kuipers said. Bars, restaurants and clubs will all return to pre-pandemic opening hours and full capacity for the first time in almost two years from that date. Masks will no longer be required in most places, but will remain obligatory on public transport and at airports, and quarantine for those with Covid-19 will be cut to five days. “The country will open again,” Kuipers said. But he warned that while the Netherlands seemed “over the peak” and pressure on hospitals was manageable, the pandemic was “not over”: “We can be optimistic, but we also have to be realistic.” The Dutch decision follows similar moves by England, Sweden, Denmark and – from Saturday – Norway, all of which have recently lifted almost all coronavirus restrictions after hospital admissions in their latest waves, fuelled largely by the milder Omicron variant, did not rise in parallel with often record infection rates. Hans Kluge, the director of the World Health Organization’s 53-country Europe region, said this month that vaccine-derived and natural immunity, the arrival of spring and the less severe Omicron variant had opened up the prospect of “a long period of tranquillity” in the pandemic, with a “much higher level of defence” against any fresh resurgence in infection rates. In Germany, where the Omicron surge began several weeks later than in many European countries, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, consulted the 16 state leaders on Wednesday to map a way out of coronavirus restrictions as official figures showed new infections beginning to fall. “We are past the peak of the Omicron wave, pretty much exactly on the day I predicted a month ago,” the health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said on Tuesday, making a “modest loosening” of restrictions possible. Many German states have already moved to scrap rules preventing people without proof of vaccination or recovery from visiting non-essential stores, and Scholz and the state governors are looking at proposals to gradually drop most restrictions by 20 March bar face masks on public transport and in indoor public spaces. Germany is also hesitating over plans to introduce a general vaccination mandate this spring, with a growing number of politicians questioning whether the initiative will find a majority in parliament. Health authorities in Denmark said last Friday they were considering “winding down” the country’s vaccination programme in the spring and saw no reason now to administer a booster dose to children or a fourth shot to any more residents at risk of severe Covid-19. The Danish health authority said the country’s third infection wave was waning “due to the large population immunity”, meaning “we can cope with increasing infection without getting serious illness”.",News/World news,Coronavirus restrictions ease across Europe despite high case rates,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/coronavirus-restrictions-ease-across-europe-despite-high-case-rates
2/16/2022,"The UK’s Security Service, MI5, has been forced to disclose top secret files to an investigation into historical operations in Northern Ireland for the first time, it has emerged. The revelations by the British chief of an investigation into an alleged spy at the heart of the IRA come as an influential US congressman denounced British government plans for an amnesty for those involved in crimes during the Troubles as a “cover-up”.  Jon Boutcher, former chief constable of Bedfordshire police, has spent five years examining the involvement of a state agent codenamed Stakeknife in IRA kidnappings, torture and murder. He told Congress his Operation Kenova investigation had now extended to 250 murders. He also told Congress he had made successful legal challenges to MI5 and was getting fresh information on crimes that had never been seen by previous police chiefs including three official government inquiries led by former Met commissioner John Stevens. “We’ve recovered records other investigations, previously commissioned, were not provided access to. “We have access in to MI5, into the military and into the PSNI, direct access. It’s something I insisted upon having spoken to a lot of those who previously led legacy investigations,” he said. “It’s realistic to suggest that some of the access that wasn’t provided years ago was because of the proximity of those investigations to the conflict. There was a lot of people in those organisations leading those organisations who were affiliated to a side in the conflict and therefore they made it hard to get the material.” Boutcher was speaking for the first time since he completed his interim report into the killings, which is yet to be published. He was giving evidence to a hearing at Congress’s Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, which also took evidence from victims’ families including Geraldine Finucane, whose lawyer husband Pat was murdered in 1989, and victims campaigner Alan McBride whose wife and father-in-law were killed in a fish shop in the Shankill Road in 1993. Co-chair of the committee, veteran Republican congressman Chris Smith, vowed to help their campaign to stop the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, going ahead with the legislation dealing with the legacy of the Troubles. Smith said the UK plan was the “final nail in the cover-up they are engaging in” adding: “This is not a done deal … this can be checkmated before it goes any further”. The laws were due to be tabled last autumn and have been delayed twice. Boutcher said he believed the government was at “a tipping point” in relation to the legislation and urged them to think again as families deserved the truth. “If the truth is denied that the next generation will carry on the fight for answers and the past will not heal,” he said. Smith’s co-chair, the Democrat Jim McGovern, said he hoped the government would “step back” from the legacy legislation. “Now is not the time to give up on accountability for the terrible human rights abuses committed during the Troubles”. Mark Thompson, chief executive of Relatives for Justice, told the hearing that 1,700 families would be denied the truth if the UK government’s plan for a statute of limitations on investigations went ahead. Boutcher said families of security forces killed in Northern Ireland had suffered too. He had discovered many families “had not heard from the authorities or the police for many many years”. It was “fair to say they felt incredibly let down”. He said it was right that the UK state agencies were opening up files to his Operation Kenova and that investigations were viable despite arguments of challenges presented by the fact some of the crimes happened decades ago. “Security forces are often of a view that any examination of legacy is of itself a criticism of that. And the disclosure of information represents a threat to national security. “Neither is correct, is what sets us apart as a democracy. Having been able to deal with these cases properly at the time because of the danger that existed to everyone, we should now do what we can to give families the investigation they deserve,” he said. In response to the hearing, the UK government said it was “rightly listening to the feedback it has received and considering how the proposals … might be amended to better meet the needs of those impacted by the Troubles”. A spokesperson said: “The government is absolutely committed to addressing legacy issues comprehensively and fairly” adding the proposals would include “measures that focus on information recovery, so that families can know what happened to their loved ones, and which promote reconciliation, so all communities in Northern Ireland can move forward”.

2/16/2022,"Late last month, Yoichi Yatsuda slept in his own home for the first time in more than a decade. As a resident of Futaba, a town in the shadow of the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, there was a time when simply spending the night in his family home had seemed an impossible dream.  The 70-year-old was one of tens of thousands of people who were forced to flee and start a life in nuclear limbo when the plant had a triple meltdown in March 2011. As Japan reeled after the earthquake and tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people and triggered the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, Yatsuda and his wife, Analisa, and an estimated 160,000 other residents of Fukushima prefecture packed a few belongings and left, believing they would be back within weeks. “If you had told me at the beginning that I would have to wait this long to come home, I would have given up straight away,” said Yatsuda, a retired professional keirin cyclist who has lived in more than 10 places since the disaster. Today, the couple are attempting to rebuild their lives in Futaba, the last of dozens of towns and villages to have ended their status as no-go zones after radiation levels were deemed low enough for people to return. They made periodic visits to repair and refurbish their house, which was once overrun by wild boar, and have been allowed to stay overnight on a trial basis since late January. Local authorities hope more people will follow when the evacuation order is officially lifted in parts of the town later this year. Yatsuda’s homecoming has been bittersweet. Before the disaster, Futaba was home to about 7,000 people. Just 15 residents applied to take part in the trial, and to date only three, including Yasuda and his wife, have moved back permanently. Many of his former neighbours have found jobs and built new lives in other parts of the region and across Japan. In a poll by the reconstruction agency, just 10% of Futaba’s former residents said they would like to return, while 60% had no plans to go back. Those with young children are the most reluctant to contemplate returning to a town that has no schools, shops, restaurants, hospitals or public services. Those with homes that survived the tsunami – which killed 50 people in Futaba – have had them demolished, leaving the town dotted with empty plots of land. Yatsuda’s only neighbour – although he lives a short drive away – is Yasushi Hosozawa, who lives in a tiny room above a parking space and a shed filled with his beloved fishing rods. “I was born here, and I always felt that if I was ever given the chance to return, then I would take it,” said Hosozawa, whose wife and son run a restaurant in another Fukushima town farther inland. “I love fishing and have my own boat moored here … that was a big factor in deciding to come back.” The 78-year-old, a former plumber and cafeteria owner, returned late last month to find that his water supply had yet to be reconnected, meaning he had to drive to the railway station to use the toilet. “There used to be lots of people here,” he said, pointing at patches of grass where his neighbours’ homes once stood. “But look at it now … it’s a wasteland.” Like many Fukushima residents, Yatsuda has little positive to say about Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the company that operates the nuclear plant, where decommissioning work is expected to last decades. “I believed Tepco when they said that something like the 2011 disaster could never happen,” he said. “It’s all about trust. When I returned to Fukushima 40 years ago, I was assured that this was a safe place to live.” While no one expects life in Futaba to ever return to its pre-disaster normality, local officials believe more people will resettle. The town has set a target of attracting about 2,000 people, including new residents, over the next five years, and new public housing for 25 households will open in October. “Very few people want to come back, so can you really say that the town has recovered?” said Yatsuda, who will plant flowers in his garden this spring and, he hopes, reopen the gym behind his home where he trained aspiring keirin racers before the disaster. “The problem is people can’t see physical signs of recovery with their own eyes. Unless the authorities do more to create jobs and attract new residents, I can’t see things improving much in the next 10 years.” The stress of life as an evacuee has taken a toll on his mental and physical health, but he has no regrets about returning to a town that, its three current residents aside, still resembles a nuclear ghost town. “This is our house. This is where we played with our children when they were little,” he said. While the couple have no concerns about radiation, they have accepted that, for now, they must travel outside the town to spend time with their eight grandchildren. “We used to enjoy seeing friends and playing with our grandchildren here,” said Analisa. “It would be great if younger families moved here … I desperately want to see and hear children again.”",News/World news,Last Fukushima town to reopen welcomes back its first residents,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/futaba-last-fukushima-town-to-reopen-welcomes-back-its-first-residents
2/16/2022,"They Live in the Grey is another classy effort on the Shudder streaming platform, properly scary and thoughtfully constructed, with unusual editing and framing sleights of hand, co-directed by Hmong-American brothers Abel and Burlee Vang. But Grey also serves an emotionally devastating study of grief, one anchored by a wrenching lead performance from Michelle Krusiec, who plays a social worker Claire Yang. Claire is assigned to investigate a case of possible domestic abuse involving a pre-adolescent girl named Sophie (Madelyn Grace) living in a tense home with parents Audrey (Ellen Wroe, excellent) and Arthur (Bernard Bullen); Claire starts to see the ghost (Mercedes Manning) of a woman whose poltergeisting may be the cause of Sophie’s bruises. Claire has always been able to see dead people, like the kid in The Sixth Sense, which must be a terrible stress as the dead walk up to her thinking they’re still alive even though they have, say, a massive head wound or blood draining out of their wrists. On top of all that, she’s still dealing with the pain of her own young son’s death a year earlier, for which she blames herself. The details are left troublingly vague until the end, so as to introduce a little doubt about Claire’s own mothering skills, especially since the loss seems to have opened up a rift between her and her policeman husband (Ken Kirby). The Vang brothers adeptly weave the various subplots together to both offer a sense of closure and also satisfy genre fans, with the obligatory lashings of gore and a bitter, metallic aftertaste in its troubling portrait of motherhood gone wrong.  But in a way the film’s best bits are the quiet scenes where the audience is primed to expect something awful is about to happen, only to find the point is not a jump scare but a harrowing emotional insight. There’s a scene, for example, where Claire lies in bed pretending to sleep as her husband comes back from a shift and crawls in beside her, the whole sequence shot in deep focus. The point is that she’s actually more terrified of opening up about the pain inside her, examining it and letting it go, than she is of any of the ectoplasmic visions she has daily.

2/16/2022,"The French government has condemned the actions of a Paris police officer who was suspended after he was allegedly recorded saying a Parisian teacher who made a sexual assault complaint was a “whore”. Lawyers and rights groups reacted with outrage after a recording was released on the investigative website Mediapart of the police officer repeatedly insulting the woman and questioning her case.  The police officer has not been named. The 34-year-old teacher, named in the media as Elodie, had called the police in the early hours of Saturday 5 February to report being sexually assaulted by a stranger who grabbed her on a street in central Paris. She was interviewed by officers and the suspect was arrested and questioned. Later that day, another officer called the woman’s phone from the police station. He left a message saying he needed to talk to the woman about the case. But he did not hang up his phone correctly. The woman’s answerphone recorded him for over three minutes joking with colleagues in the office suggesting that the woman was likely to be sleeping off a hangover and that the case didn’t make sense. He was recorded several times as saying that she was a “pute” – a “great big whore” – who was just trying to make life difficult for the man. The interior minister Gérald Darmanin, said it was right the officer had been suspended and his actions had sullied the whole force. The Paris police department said they have asked for an independent inquiry. “No offensive or abusive behaviour will be tolerated by a police officer against a victim,” it said in a statement, adding that it had been working to improve its policy towards victims of sexual and domestic violence. The feminist group Osez le Feminisme questioned the police officer’s work environment. It said: “How is it that a police officer feels he has the right to talk like that about a victim in front of his colleagues? What work atmosphere could allow him to think he could do that with total impunity?” The group added: “How many other times has a woman been called a great big whore by the police officer in charge of her case without it being recorded? How can one hope for impartial treatment of a complaint when you’re called a whore by the police?”",News/World news,France condemns Paris police officer for allegedly insulting sexual assault victim,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/france-condemns-paris-police-officer-for-allegedly-insulting-sex-assault-victim
2/16/2022,"In my years as a journalist, I’ve had some challenging assignments: file a piece about an underground dinner for Michelin-starred chefs that ends at 3am in time for it to hit the morning pages, write an obit for an almost-dead person by calling up his nearest and dearest and asking for a few punchy quotes. But all pale in comparison with my new assignment which, like Sisyphus, I must complete nightly. “Tell me a story about a book that is broken, and then the unicorn comes for a sleepover, but she’s really big,” my preschooler barks from her bed, her face awash in the neon pink emanating from her polar bear nightlight.  For years when I was a child, my father told me a serialized story featuring my stuffed animal, Bernie the Beaver, and his friend, Lou the pigeon. Brooklyn born and raised, Lou was often depicted swaggering down the middle of 59th Street squawking out, “I’m walkin’ here!” as cabs swerved to avoid him. Many of the events took place where I spent my time – Central Park, the American Museum of Natural History, the library – but Bernie and Lou’s park was full of magic places only they knew about, their museum’s dioramas came alive at night, and on and on. Dad had a real knack for storytelling, and knew just when and how to employ a cliffhanger, just how much narrative tension a young child could handle. I’d fall asleep with visions of the world outside my door coming alive, awaiting the following night’s chapter with all the anticipation of a Victorian-era Pickwick Papers reader. Why, a generation later, you might ask, am I taking narrative direction from someone who requests sprinkles on her eggs? Why not just recycle a beloved story I already know? Oh, I tried, at one point, but they all fell flat, so she smartly wrested control to ground the plot in her everyday life. I’ve made repeated attempts to focus them on a single hero – the prime candidate being her Cabbage Patch doll, so beloved that it has become her personal security detail, never leaving her side, and thus emanates an odor more appropriate to a medieval feast hall than a child’s bedroom. But no dice. A second, perhaps more pressing question: Why bother? Why not just end our bedtime ritual with a book? Any form of storytelling – be that read or heard – has been shown to have myriad benefits for children: it increases verbal exposure, is beneficial for socio-emotional development, and enhances the ability to retain information. In hospital settings, it’s been shown to increase oxytocin and lower pain. And hearing stories about one’s own family, and knowing where you fit into that family narrative, has been linked to greater resilience and happiness. All good things, none of which require that I become Spalding Gray at the end of a long day. Plus, my preschooler might be too young to latch on to aural stories. They are, according to at least one study, too “cold” – she needs the pictures to make everything come into focus. Still, I keep at it, not just because I have fond memories of my own father spinning me wonderful yarns, but also because my hunch is that once I nail the art form, something magical will happen. “We’re the only creatures who tell stories, and it’s the job of adults to tell them to children,” Len Cabral told me over Zoom recently, “But there’s a lot of oh, I’m a little busy now, or I just can’t think of one.” Cabral has been a professional storyteller since the 1970s, performing treasured folktales as well as original stories everywhere from schools to the Kennedy Center. In 2001, he received the National Storytelling Networks’ Circle of Excellence Oracle Award, and when not performing, he teaches workshops on how to perfect the craft – when to pause, when to ask questions, voices to use, and the like. I came to him through a close friend, his niece through marriage, who sat her children in front of Zoom with Cabral throughout the pandemic. In videos of his work online, you can see him quiet a rowdy room with a look, morph into a snail riding on the back of a turtle (“Wheeeee!”), and bring auditoriums of children to a sort of rapture normally exhibited by Publishers Clearing House winners. We spoke about how little movements can have huge impacts – he raised his arms, became a bear, then scrunched them in, and became a chipmunk – and the importance, and soothing nature, of repetition, both within a story and when telling it again and again. He told me how amazing it is to see the unique imagination of each of his listeners when they’re asked to draw the story after sessions with him, one reason he loves the oral tradition – your Anansi may look very different from mine. As for parents who don’t know where to begin? “I’ll tell the kids, every scar is a story,” he said. “So check your parents out. Say, Dad, how’d that happen? Here comes a story. Your mom fell off a bike? Your grandparents worked on a farm? They’ve got stitches. They’ve got scars. They’ve got a story.” There is, for writers like myself, one other reason we might want to capitalize on bedtime – at least according to George Saunders, one of the most beloved fiction writers of our time, who’s been a recipient of or finalist for almost every prestigious fiction award, including the Man Booker Prize and the National Book Award. And because the world sometimes makes sense, he’s also a good person, at least if you judge character by how long it takes someone to respond to a cold request for thoughts on bedtime storytelling. “I used to tell stories to our girls when they were little and what I loved about that was the way it forced me to take chances in front of them,” Saunders wrote to me, seven hours after I lobbed an email into the abyss and crossed my fingers. “Selfishly, I tend to be a very controlled and controlling writer – lots of revision and all of that – so the act of doing pure improv for these beloved little people, and the immediate and honest reaction I would get, was wonderful – actually gave me the courage to grow my ‘real’ work in the direction of spontaneity.” Saunders said he and his children would collaborate on plot, and together invented a “mansplainer” named Eddie, a recurring character who allowed them to explore morality before shuteye. Saunders’ children’s book The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip came out of one of these nightly story times. But even for a professional writer, that endgame wasn’t the point – the impulse to create was much more fundamental. “What a lovely thing it was, to huddle together and make something up at the end of the day,” he wrote. Indeed. The other night, at the preschooler’s direction, I told a story about a book that breaks because it is so beloved, and read so much, that it finally falls apart. The savior: a unicorn. It was no Saunders, but at least it hung together. After a beat, my daughter sat up in bed. “Tell it again, Mama,” she said. So I did.
