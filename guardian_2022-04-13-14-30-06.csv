Now firmly in the public spotlight, his tears at the 1990 World Cup semi-finals give birth to what the Sun dubs “Gazzamania”, piling pressure on the young star.

4/13/2022,"For years, people living in Castelnuovo di Porto, a medieval village close to Rome, had put off doing maintenance jobs on their homes, whether it be fixing the roof or cracks in walls caused by earthquakes, because they could not afford it. So when the Italian government said it would foot the entire bill for a range of renovation works, on the sole proviso of rendering buildings energy efficient and earthquake-proof, they could not believe their luck. “When I first heard about the government getting all this money from the EU, I didn’t think it would affect me in the slightest,” said Chris Warde-Jones, a British photographer born in Italy. “But when people in the village started talking about doing up houses – and there are a lot that need doing up here, quite a few are showing their age – our ears pricked up and we thought: hold on, can we do this too?” Thousands of Italian and foreign homeowners have flocked to access Italy’s generous superbonus 110% scheme, which has so far cost the government about €21bn (£17.5bn) since launching in July 2020 as part of the country’s post-pandemic recovery strategy. As the name suggests, homeowners are entitled to a tax deduction of up to 110% on the cost of upgrading their home, such as installing insulation systems, heat pumps and solar panels or replacing an old boiler, or undertaking works that reduce the risk of damage from seismic activity. People can claim the subsidy by deducting the costs of the works from their tax returns over a five-year period, or pass the onus on to the building contractor, who deducts it from their taxes or sells the credit to a bank, which in turn is refunded by the government. The extra 10% covers bank interest. The scheme applies to works on either single houses or buildings that contain more than one home, although in these cases the permission of the other homeowners is needed. Warde-Jones has come together with four shared homeowners to do several jobs on their 18th-century tufa stone house totalling more than €200,000, including replacing the roof. “It’s been a bit of a nightmare from the point of view of organising four different families, but we’re getting there,” said Warde-Jones. “Work has not yet started, but the bureaucratic side of things is well on its way.” Several other EU countries have subsidy schemes for home improvements as they work towards carbon emission reduction goals, but none are as bountiful as Italy’s. Some say the subsidies, the vast majority of the money coming from the EU’s post-Covid recovery fund, are too generous, describing the move as a “shock tactic” to get the system going in a country with a huge stock of old or poorly constructed buildings. It certainly achieved that. As of 1 March, more than 122,000 applications had been approved. “The EU said we need to become a zero-emission society by 2050, and to do that, the entire property stock, private or public, needs to be restructured,” said Riccardo Fraccaro, the deputy and senior member of the Five Star Movement who first proposed the superbonus. “This was a way to incentivise people and companies to do it.” Fraccaro points to the scheme’s success so far, such as an immediate boost for the construction sector, GDP and the creation of more than 150,000 new jobs. However, soaring demand also pushed up the cost of building services, although Fraccaro said the government had now put price caps on raw materials, and left the limited supply of contractors capable of doing the works booked up to the hilt for at least a year. And even though the initiative impedes illegal activity as the credit can only be claimed via tax returns, Italy’s tax agency found €950m worth of fraud connected to the superbonus and other home improvements schemes late last year. “As with everything, there are always those who try to be crafty, but the fraud within the superbonus was minimal, things like people creating fake building sites,” said Fraccaro. “We are making the system more rigid, although it is very difficult to defraud the superbonus as so many requirements and technical checks are needed before the subsidy is approved.” Another issue is the time constraint – the initiative will be gradually reduced in size before ending in 2025. However, the main question is whether the superbonus is having the desired effects. Michele Governatori, from the climate and energy thinktank Ecco, said the scheme was commendable and most definitely needed, especially with buildings in Italy consuming an enormous amount of energy. “It will definitely lead to improvements, although how much is too early to say,” he said. His main criticism is that the subsidy allows for new gas boilers, ultimately continuing use of fossil fuels. “If you replace your old boiler, adding certain efficiency parameters, with a gas one, you can also get a tax rebate. But this is a mistake that needs to be rectified immediately, we need to be using electric heat pumps and detaching from gas.” Fraccaro said many households had already detached from gas and in the long-run the initiative would significantly reduce dependence on the fuel, especially in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Italy is heavily reliant on gas imports from Russia and, like other European countries, is now scrambling for alternatives. In Castelnuovo di Porto, Sergio Iaquinta, a co-founder of Aiku Srl, an alliance of architects, is busy working on 13 superbonus renovation projects, including the home of Warde-Jones and his neighbours. Iaquinta is also benefiting from the scheme on his own property. He said it was chaotically executed, more so at the beginning, but believes the chaos will be worth it. “We have already seen results of insulation works, with clients calling us to say they noticed the difference straight away,” he said. “And it is helping raise awareness about the climate crisis and environmental needs, which is one of the most important things.”",News/World news,Italy’s superbonus 110% scheme prompts surge of green home renovations,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/italys-superbonus-110-scheme-prompts-surge-of-green-home-renovations
4/13/2022,"Like black bin bags caught in the tops of the tallest trees in the village, the rooks are back at their rookeries. Here on the Somerset Levels their habit of gathering together to breed makes them one of the most visible of all our birds. That is proving very helpful as I cycle around my parish and beyond to survey rookeries for the British Trust for Ornithology and the Somerset Ornithological Society. I usually hear rooks before I see them: uttering a volley of guttural cries, noticeably less harsh than their cousin, the carrion crow. As the nature writer Dominic Couzens puts it, a rook sounds like a crow who has been on an anger management course. What surprises me is that large swathes of the levels have no rookeries at all. I mostly come across them along the main roads, in clumps of ash – by far the tallest tree in this soggy, low-lying landscape. But now that ash dieback disease is ravaging our countryside, their preference for these particular trees could prove to be these birds’ downfall. For, if the ash goes, where else will the rooks find to nest? The only other widespread tree here on the levels is the willow, whose tightly packed twigs are not suitable for these bulky birds to build their nests. Perhaps in a decade’s time, if I repeat the survey, there will be no rookeries – or rooks – here at all.",News/Environment,"Birdwatch: without ash, wither rooks?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/13/birdwatch-without-ash-wither-rooks
4/13/2022,"Andy Warhol: obsessively commercial pop artist, the patron saint of reality television, Facebook, Instagram, selfies, TikTok and every other imaginable fulfilment of his prophecy that in the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes. Or so it might appear. But that is not the real him. Warhol was a seer whose surfaces conceal mysterious waters. “What people think is Andy Warhol isn’t Andy Warhol,” says Tracey Emin. Try an experiment to understand this. Start recording video and sit in front of the camera for three minutes. You are not to speak. You are not to leave your seat. Just look into the camera. “Be yourself.” But who is that? This is what Warhol subjected people to in his Screen Tests, filmed at his New York studio the Factory in the 1960s. His subjects look dazed by an unblinking scrutiny. They can’t win. Whatever they do, the unmoving, unstopping film camera records it as the truth of who they are. Bob Dylan squirms and grimaces, openly contemptuous of the exercise – for which it’s said he grabbed one of Warhol’s Elvis paintings as “payment” – yet that becomes his portrait, and it is painfully callow. A young Lou Reed is soft and vulnerable, but in a later appearance he has learned the game, or thinks he has, and tries to stonewall the camera by keeping his black shades on while drinking a bottle of Coke in a sarcastic dig at Warhol’s pop art. Again, it’s a perfect portrait of who he was at that moment. So if social media were really like Warhol’s Screen Tests, we would be constantly facing our sins in a confessional. We would live in truth. A more famous Warhol portrait will go on auction at Christie’s in New York in May: his Marilyn, the most iconic face of pop art. Warhol first created it in 1962, the year Monroe took her life, by cropping a publicity still from her early film Niagara to focus solely on her face, then getting a silkscreen mesh made so he could print it on canvas as many times as he liked, adding hand-painted colours. It’s probably his most recognised work, “one of the rarest and most transcendent images in existence”, if you believe the Christie’s blurb, which compares it to the Mona Lisa and Botticelli’s Venus. If Christie’s has got its estimate right, his 1964 painting Shot Sage Blue Marilyn will sell for about $200m (£150m). That will make it the most expensive 20th-century work of art ever auctioned. The current record is held by Picasso. So Andy will be established as bigger than Pablo and therefore the greatest artist of the modern age – at least according to an equation of artistic and monetary value he himself invented. In 1962 Warhol started to literally print dollar bills. He churned out multiple images of the almighty dollar, not as forgeries but works of art. Money is beautiful, these early works of pop art whisper. Later he would get philosophical on the subject. “Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art. Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.” But what is it that makes Shot Sage Blue Marilyn so apparently valuable? In 1964 a visitor to Warhol’s studio named Dorothy Podber created her own moment of performance art by pulling a gun and shooting a newly silkscreened Marilyn in the forehead. The shot went through the stack of canvases behind it; the one on sale still bears the poorly concealed scar. That frisson of violence and chaos adds to the sales pitch. But it’s all just the market’s way of catching up with the outrageous and unlikely fact that Andy Warhol is the greatest and most profound artist to have worked anywhere since 1945. Warhol’s portrait of Marilyn seems to sum up so much about him. He made the word “superstar” famous, applying it to anyone who took his eye and could hold their own in the amphetamine-fuelled, sarcastic atmosphere of the Factory. His studio and hangout with silver foil walls came to define 60s Manhattan and regularly gets recreated in films as a plastic fantastic party venue. Warhol mixed adoration of “real” stars such as Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor and Elvis with a levelling belief that anyone can be a celebrity, at least for a moment. There’s a story that Judy Garland attended a party at the Factory only to be studiously ignored. Warhol made himself a celebrity, too, paving the way for today’s artists with his conscious exploitation of the media in everything from chatshow and soap appearances – albeit monosyllabic ones – to a burger ad that has become a posthumous viral hit. His 70s Polaroid portraits even made the rich and famous pay to become Warhol subjects. He fabricated his own image as an enigmatic svengali figure, portraying himself in half shadow, in shades, in drag. There’s a better Warhol just behind the one we think we know. His greatest version of Monroe is not Shot Sage Blue Marilyn. It is Tate Modern’s 1962 Marilyn Diptych, painted just after her death, which repeats her face in bright colours on one canvas while on the other she fades to grey in a haunting film strip of memory failing, fame decaying, time running out. The inner Andy has taken over, and he has more on his mind than fame or money. Emin admits it was only fairly recently that she saw Warhol’s true nature. Like any future artist and David Bowie fan growing up in 70s Margate, she was fascinated by him. “When I was at school I used to imagine that I would go to New York by boat and when I walked down the gangplank Andy Warhol would be there waiting for me.” But later, as a young artist, she would ask herself: “Who would you rather be – Andy Warhol or Joseph Beuys?” In those days Beuys appeared the true visionary to her, the shaman. He was a rear gunner in a Stuka dive bomber in the second world war who got shot down over the Crimea and saved – as he told it – by Tatar shamans who covered his burns with felt and fat. These substances became his ritual materials. Warhol, by contrast, was born in Pittsburgh in 1928, became a successful advertising artist drawing shoes in 50s Manhattan, then turned to fine art at the beginning of the 60s when contemporaries such as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Roy Lichtenstein were proving art could be made out of the stuff of everyday life and pop culture. “Warhol always looks external, but he was the real shaman,” Emin thinks now. A shaman can shapeshift and enter other worlds to communicate with spirits and the dead. Take a look at Warhol’s 1963 painting Five Deaths on Orange. In the shocking news image that Warhol has silkscreened in black on an abstract plane of fiery colour, a young man and woman are crawling out of an upside down car. They look back into the twisted metal cage they have escaped, where a woman lies among dead bodies, her eyes blankly staring at yours. Is she dead, near death, dazed? She seems to have seen things the living don’t see. The two survivors look as if they are peering across a mortal threshold, while her eyes meet ours from the far side. If I was going to fork out $200m for a Warhol it would be one of the Death and Disaster series to which this belongs. In fact the current record price for one of his works is held by Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), which sold for $105m in 2013. The Warhol we think we know didn’t last long. In 1962, he put on a sensational show of carefully painted Campbell’s soup cans at the Ferus Gallery, Los Angeles. The same year he started silkscreening Marilyn’s face. But by 1963 he and his assistant Gerard Malanga were ransacking tabloid news photos, some of which went back to the 1940s, of car crashes and suicides, and silkscreening these as black stains in fields of purple, red, green, silver. That same year John F Kennedy was shot dead and Warhol portrayed Jackie Kennedy at his funeral, her veiled face wounded by the nation’s disaster. In Green Car Crash he repeats over and over, as if he can’t quite believe it, an image in which a man has been thrown out of a car and impaled on a tree. The car burns below his suspended corpse. A witness walks nonchalantly by, apparently unconcerned by this scene of extreme suffering. That indifferent onlooker is exactly what many assume Warhol to have been himself: an unmoved spectator who celebrated not caring, the silver-wigged voyeur numbly pointing a camera. His harshest critic, Robert Hughes, called it “diligent and frigid” in an essay dismissing Warhol as one of the “affectless heroes” of the media age. But in Green Car Crash it is Warhol who portrays, and criticises, such emotionless looking; the man who walks on by is even scarier than the burning car. What the passerby ignores, what we modern secular people are schooled to ignore, is the miracle, the sign, amid the horror. For the man hanging from the tree has been turned into an image of Christ, his body fixed up there for all to see. John Richardson, Picasso’s biographer and a friend of Warhol, revealed in a speech at the artist’s memorial service in 1987 that Warhol attended church regularly all his life and served secretly in soup kitchens. The world has had more than three decades to assimilate this information of Warhol’s religiosity, yet for many it is a bitter wafer. His latest biographer, Blake Gopnik, tries to dismiss the idea of Warhol as a Catholic artist. “Warhol certainly lived a less holy life, made more profane art and committed more mortal sins than should have been on the conscience of any devout Catholic, as defined by his era.” But since when were Catholic artists pure? From Caravaggio, to the novels of Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene, the most powerful religious art is often driven by a sense of damnation. “Warhol was so spiritual about everything,” says Emin. You can go from seeing nothing but materialism in Warhol’s art to seeing the spirit everywhere. Soup cans? The sacrament. Marilyn’s mysterious face? A Byzantine icon; Warhol’s parents were from what is now eastern Slovakia and he was brought up in the Byzantine Catholic faith. And in the Marilyn diptych he explicitly uses the tradition of the medieval Christian altarpiece to depict Monroe as a modern martyr. If that all seems excessive, Warhol managed to leave a very clear final testament confirming his worldview: an epic series of paintings of The Last Supper, silkscreened from a cheap repro of Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece, in 1986, the year before he died. His life had been shadowed by frailty ever since he was shot, in 1968, by Valerie Solanas. He showed his wounded torso to be photographed by Richard Avedon and painted by Alice Neel, offering the image of himself as tortured saint, flagellated Christ. Emin, who is the same age now that Warhol was when he died, and who recently survived cancer after life-changing surgery, is particularly fascinated by the late Warhol. “I really respect what Andy Warhol did after he was shot. He said all the tax has got to be paid, we’re cleaning up … He just grew up. He got rid of the Factory and got an office and everybody wore suits and ties. He realised all he could really give was to be an artist.” In The Last Supper it is that moment we see. It is his own valedictory feast. For me, the disciples at the table are people from the Factory: Candy Darling, Edie Sedgwick, Billy Name, Ondine. The Factory was not just a party scene. It was Warhol’s most risky venture into the extremes of sin and salvation, a theatre of human possibility and suffering in which the actors didn’t go off stage after two hours but played out their parts to the sometimes awful end. To just see it as the beginning of multimedia art and the death of painting doesn’t quite capture the strange authority of this artist and the milieu he wove around him. When Warhol moved out of fine art it was to let in the life of the streets, where the choices you make are moral, not just aesthetic. “Andy Warhol made the real more real,” says Emin. He could do a very good impression of someone who didn’t give a damn. “Do you think when Edie jumps she’ll let us film it?” he is reputed to have said, apparently hoping Sedgwick would attempt suicide on camera. Yet he too was a character in this morality play, or Catholic novel. Is Warhol the devil leading sinners on an amphetamine-strewn path to hell, the bad Samaritan who does nothing – or rather, the recording angel who sees all? In his Screen Tests the camera is the eye of God. Nothing gets past it. If this all makes Warhol sound a bit romantic, that is exactly what he was. He is one of the few artists in recent times who lived up to the 19th-century cult of the artist as someone other, bohemian, able to see what others don’t. Adopting a distant mysterious persona, surrounding himself with people living on the edge, he took Romanticism into a new realm of modernity. He licensed such inspired chaos it got him shot. So it’s not surprising that this artist so full of mystery and surprise is poised to outsell Picasso and become, by commercial acclaim, the god of modern art. But could we end up killing the thing we love? There’s an edge to Warhol that doesn’t let him slide smoothly into the mainstream. Constant subversion of the pop culture he seems to crave is what makes him so enduring. Christie’s sale of one of his less emotional Marilyns celebrates a middlebrow saint, but he’s not that. “Andy Warhol was not a popular artist,” Emin points out. “He was always alternative: alternative to everything that was going.”",Arts/Art and design,Yours for $200m: how Warhol overtook Picasso to become the most prized artist of the 20th century,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/13/yours-for-200m-how-warhol-overtook-picasso-to-become-the-most-prized-artist-of-the-20th-century
4/13/2022,"When Edward Burtynsky and I first speak, he’s been organising a print sale for Ukraine: editions of two large-format photographs, which raise nearly C$750,000 (£455,000) in a matter of hours. It takes me a moment to remember that this is personal, very much so – Burtynsky may have grown up on the shoreline of Lake Ontario but his parents emigrated from Ukraine in the late 1940s. His mother fled starvation under the Soviets, before being forced into a labour camp by the Nazis. Now 97, she has been watching the news obsessively. Burtynsky’s sister has been fielding texts from relatives in and around Kyiv, with an eye to getting them to Canada if necessary. “It’s kind of surreal,” says the artist, his voice flat. “They’re frightened, they’re hearing bombs all the time. It feels very real, you know?” They’re OK? “Currently.” He should have been making photographs in Ukraine last year, he adds; a project exploring the country’s industrial history and his own roots. Perhaps even portraits – something he hasn’t done for ages. It’s not going to happen for the moment, though as soon as it’s safe he is determined to get out and collaborate with a Ukrainian photographer he admires, Maxim Dondyuk. He is shaking his head. “Unbelievable, the amount of hate and trauma that’s being inflicted. [Putin]’s destroying the future of a whole generation of Russians and traumatising the whole country of Ukraine. It’ll take generations to heal.” Burtynksy may generally focus on landscapes rather than faces, but trauma – and its lasting impact – is very much his subject. There is perhaps no greater chronicler alive of the injuries that humans have inflicted on the planet. From teetering tyre dumps to toxic lakes, oilfields stained acid yellow and hills stripped bare by drought, Burtynsky has crisscrossed the globe in search of images that show what we have really done to the world. The interesting paradox, though, is the epic allure he finds in such scenes. Looking at vertiginous quarries in Portugal (“inverted skyscrapers”, he’s called them) or green farmland somehow conjured out of the arid Texas plains, you don’t always know whether to feel awe at the ingenuity by which such resources are extracted, or despair at whether the damage can ever be healed. Sometimes, all you can do is admire the formal power of these photographs, which are now in major museums worldwide and as intricately composed as abstract paintings by Willem de Kooning or Clyfford Still. Other times, you need to look close to convince yourself they’re not actually paintings. Speaking as he’s about to receive a lifetime award from the World Photography Organisation, Burtynsky himself admits he doesn’t always know what to feel. On one level, his images are a “lament for loss”, but there’s also a kind of wonder at these scenes: at creation as well as destruction. “I don’t quite have an explanation for why it’s interesting, but I take the photograph anyway,” he says cautiously. “I trust my instincts.” Growing up in the blue-collar city of St Catharines, Ontario, during the 1960s, he saw industry everywhere. General Motors was the biggest employer, and noise from the car plant “pounded through the city all the time”. His father worked there until being diagnosed with cancer – a result, Burtynsky believes, of chemicals he’d been exposed to on the welding line. He was dead at 45. It was his dad who gave him his first camera, a 35mm Minolta. You don’t need to be a psychoanalyst to see some connection between what Burtynsky does and his father’s experience, or the fragile balance his images find between life and death, beauty and creeping horror. Later, to pay himself through art school, Burtynsky also worked at GM, helping clean up some of the toxic sludge that he suspects had killed his father. “Men were still working up to their elbows in the oil at the time,” he remembers, “which felt almost like a death sentence to me.” He also spent five months underground in a goldmine. “My dad worked on one side of this brick wall and I got to see the other side,” he reflects. “I felt, we don’t really understand the worlds that exist to make a car – the machines that make the machines, you know?” The colours he remembers especially vividly: “Guys in the forge plants wearing these aluminium suits, casting red-hot ingots.” After a few embarrassing attempts at street photography, Burtynsky was given a student assignment to search out “evidence of man”, and found it in an unexpected place: an abandoned shipping canal that once connected the Great Lakes. Yet it wasn’t until 1982, when he got lost on a trip through coal country in Pennsylvania and found the remains of a mine, that it all began to connect. “It was a rich world to take the camera into,” he says. Early on, Burtynsky knew that he wanted to shoot big and shoot slow, travelling with a galumphing 8x10 bellows field camera, heavy lenses, tripods – a car boot full of equipment that would enable him to make prints large enough to show these scenes in all their brutal majesty. Problem was, no one wanted to buy them. The few people who were interested in large-format colour photography (then largely used in advertising) didn’t want railway cuttings or contaminated watercourses on the wall, no matter how aesthetically impressive. With his then-wife Jeannie Baxter, he set up a specialist photo lab in Toronto to provide an income; it was only when a collector offered to bankroll him that he was able to devote himself to picture-making. He chose quarries as his first project: “I had never seen a picture of one, and that began my research. Where are these places? What do they look like?” Burtynsky’s work in the decades since has been patient and consistent, almost as relentless as the processes he documents. One strand has focused on mining – rock faces gouged by explosives and louring mountains of spoil from Montana to China to Australia. Another series (his most famous) visited the shipbreaking yards of Chittagong in Bangladesh: mighty rusted hulls being dismembered like dead whales, lit by Turner-esque oxyacetylene sparks. Turner, who was equally fascinated by what’s been called the “industrial sublime”, might be a suggestive comparison. Certainly, Burtynsky’s landscapes make those by romanticising photographers such as Ansel Adams, framed to exclude any hint of human involvement, seem chintzy. Multi-year, multi-continent projects on oil and water have led inexorably to the biggest subject of all, the climate crisis, which culminated in 2018’s Anthropocene, a photobook and film. Burtynsky’s current assignment, images from which will be on display in London, traverses Africa – a continent he has visited often – and includes landscapes more conventionally picturesque than many he has made before. Wherever you look, it’s impossible to escape climate, he says. “We’re on the very edge of losing it, whether it’s the corals, the ancient forests, flora and fauna in Africa, the oceans and fish.” What drives him? Sometimes his photographs echo those of socially concerned photojournalists such as Sebastião Salgado; sometimes they’re more formalist, closer to Düsseldorf photographers including Thomas Struth or Candida Höfer. Is he an activist? He doesn’t think so. He says his work is “revelatory, not accusatory”. He’s not a disaster photographer, he adds – or, if he is, we’re all implicated. “If this is a disaster, then look around your house, at your car and your fridge. What’s in there? Where does it come from? “We are all participating in these landscapes,” he says. “Including me.” These days he works with enough assistants and fixers to supply a Victorian expedition, but his workflow remains essentially the same: research locations (often using Google Maps), negotiate access (he’s relaxed if his prints of factories or refineries end up on boardroom walls, he says; it’s a price worth paying), hire drone operators or helicopter pilots to get his cameras to where he wants to get them, and then spend months editing. Though the technology he uses is state-of-the art – his current squeeze is a 150-megapixel Danish model that costs £40,000 – every print is meticulously produced by his team in Toronto, with Burtynsky controlling every aspect. Perhaps needless to say, these days he has no sales problems: his pictures go for tens of thousands of dollars, though Burtynsky seems discomfited by the glitzier reaches of the art world. “It gets a little distasteful,” he says. “The commoditisation of it.” The pandemic grounded him, but also forced him back to basics. He spent much of 2020 prowling the backwoods near his house in rural Ontario, camera in hand, working alone for the first time in many years. The pictures that resulted, a series he called Natural Order, seem quieter and more meditative than in a long time: tangled undergrowth, splodges of bright lichen on tree bark, crimson-coloured dogwood springing out of the tawny spring earth. I say I’m struck by the fact that, much like in his Africa photographs, the impact of humans is less obvious here; if there’s trauma in these images, it’s hard to detect. Is he softening in his late 60s? He chuckles. “I’ve always come back to this landscape to recentre myself and decide what’s important. Being in nature is not a cliche.

4/13/2022,"The evacuation train that was supposed to arrive in the Ukrainian town of Kramatorsk last Friday was late. Andrei Kovalov was standing on the busy platform waiting for the service that would take him west, far away from the fighting, which is on the verge of engulfing his home town of Bakhmut in Donetsk. The 45-year-old was among up to 4,000 other civilians at the train station that morning fleeing the advance of Russian troops across the country’s east. The station was hot and crowded, witnesses said; everyone was willing to stand on the long train journey, if it meant at least they could leave. The war managed to find them anyway. Before the train to Dnipro pulled in, two ballistic missiles exploded over the railway station building, dropping deadly cluster munitions – illegal under international law because of the indiscriminate damage they cause over a wide area – all over the concourse and baggage hall. “I remember it very clearly. I thought I could hear a plane, and then I was thrown on the floor,” Kovalov said from his hospital bed at a first line response hospital in the Dnipropetrovsk region. The Ukrainian authorities asked that the medical facility was not identified, as it is used for treating civilian and military casualties. “The first minute was total chaos. The emergency response tents caught fire, cars caught fire. There was blood and smoke everywhere. Then people started shouting for everyone to get out of the station. Everyone was running. I tried to run but I fell. I didn’t realise until then that I had blood all over me and holes in my body.” The leather worker was injured by shrapnel that hit his shoulder and lacerated both his legs. He was given first aid and taken to the hospital, and doctors there are hopeful he should eventually be able to walk again. Kovalov’s injuries are devastating and he is still in great pain, but he escaped alive; 57 people were killed in the Kramatorsk attack and another 109 were injured in one of the worst losses of life in a single incident in the six-week-old war to date. No soldiers were at the station at the time two Soviet-era Tochka-U missiles struck the area, Ukrainian officials said: most of those present were women and children. In the aftermath of the attack, footage from the station showed streaks of blood over the ground and large stacks of unclaimed luggage. Mobile phones rang from the bags as families tried to find out if their loved ones had survived. The casing of one of the rockets, which fell on the grass outside the front of the railway station, had been daubed in white paint with a message in Russian: za detei – for, or on behalf of, the children. But Moscow has denied it carried out the deadly strike, claiming instead that Ukraine’s armed forces are to blame. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called the Kramatorsk attack an act of “evil that has no limits”. “I have no doubt that Russia did this. I remember all the people around me. Someone died right in front of me,” Kovalov said. “One woman was screaming and dragging her child. He was missing body parts. Eventually I was able to message my mother to tell her I was OK. She had already called around all of the morgues in the region looking for me.” Volodymyr Vakulenko’s family also had a narrow escape. Vakulenko, 67, and his wife, Halyna, 63, were at the train station bidding goodbye to their grandson, his wife and their two-year-old son as they tried to get a train to the western city of Lviv. Feeling claustrophobic inside the busy baggage hall, Vakulenko had gone back outside to wait in the car when the missiles hit. Shrapnel pierced his lungs, and narrowly missed his heart, his surgeon said on Tuesday, after Vakulenko’s successful second surgery. Natalia, their grandson’s wife, threw herself over her child during the attack and was mildly injured, but the younger members of the family were soon able to leave for the west of the country. “Thank God for the doctors. [Volodymyr] is only here because of them,” said Halyna, wiping away tears at her husband’s bedside as she showed the Guardian one of the small, dense pieces of metal the doctors removed from his chest cavity. “Tiny children lying dead. Imagine living 63 years just to see this,” she said. “There were two trains coming that day, everyone knew there was going to be a lot of civilians. The Russians say they are helping us. Thank you for this kind of help.” The Kremlin has been accused by human rights organisations and war crimes investigators of carrying out airstrikes and shelling targeting civilian infrastructure in its “special military operation” aimed at overthrowing the pro-western Kyiv government. Summary executions, rapes and the torture of civilians in territory it controls have also horrified the world. According to estimates released by the Kyiv School of Economics on Monday, almost 600 educational institutions and 205 medical facilities have been damaged, destroyed or seized in the invasion so far. In addition to the airstrike on Kramatorsk’s train station full of fleeing civilians, Moscow has also targeted a maternity hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol, killing four and leading to one stillbirth, while an attack on a theatre being used as a bomb shelter in the same city is believed to have killed about 300 people. “The things the Russians are doing are shocking and cruel. It’s much worse than 2014,” said the director at the hospital treating Kovalov and Vakulenko, who has managed the facility in the eight years since conflict in the Donbas broke out. Her staff treated 85 people immediately after the Kramatorsk incident. Most patients have since been transferred to other hospitals around the country, but Kovalov and Vakulenko, along with a deeply traumatised woman who lost her child in the attack, remain in her care. “We are used to treating trauma, bullet wounds, shrapnel from mines and rockets,” she said. “But I still don’t understand how people can do this. I didn’t understand then, and I don’t understand now.”",News/World news,‘I had blood all over me’: Kramatorsk station attack survivors face long road to recovery,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/i-had-blood-all-over-me-kramatorsk-station-attack-survivors-face-long-road-to-recovery
4/13/2022,"Keen gardeners will be aware of snow mould, the fungal disease that causes off-white patches on the lawn in early spring after snow has melted. But then there’s this, a blanket-like cover of strange white material in a field below Screel Hill on the Solway Firth. In all my years of nature watching, I’ve never seen anything like it before. Initially, I sped past it to my favourite beach with Connie the springer, thinking the residue was salt, like the salt pans in Portugal. After all, this reedy hollow often has a pool of water in it. But on reflection, it was too far from the sea to be saltwater. On previous visits here I had assumed (always dangerous with unnatural history) that this pool fluctuated with the water table – either that or it just held rainwater. There are similar such small lakes on the west coast of Ireland, called turloughs; they appear and disappear according to whether the rainwater can drain into the ground. There is a turlough in Wales, one in Norfolk and three in Northern Ireland. There are, however, none in Scotland. On closer inspection, I discovered a vast, fibrous blanket with similar properties to handmade paper. It was smooth on the surface and rough underneath where the grasses and reeds clung to it, and you could even write on it. It crunched under my feet – and under Connie’s – and when I cut some bits out with scissors, it felt like cutting a cereal box; as a primary school teacher, it was like being back in the classroom. The natural sculptures it made were fascinating too: galleon-like, as it clung to the reed tussocks. Think lampshades with cheap paper stretched over the wire. So what is this mysterious substance? It appears to still be snow mould, only the fungal spores have multiplied at an unusually fast rate. It is likely that this spot had the perfect microclimate of initial snow cover, temperature and moisture for it to flourish. But why it is so papery is a puzzle and, on investigation, I have found no photographs, illustrations or indeed any written records of such a large covering. We don’t stay too long in the end because, as with other moulds, their spores can trigger an allergic reaction in some people, and indeed dogs – “Connie, come here now!”  Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",News/Environment,Country diary: What looks like snow but acts like paper?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/13/country-diary-what-looks-like-snow-but-acts-like-paper
4/13/2022,"The cost of renting a house has soared by up to 21.2% in Australia’s capital cities, with further rises expected as the national rental crisis deepens. Over the past 12 months, capital city house rents have recorded price increases of 14.7% while rental units have risen by 11.2%, SQM Research has found. Brisbane has experienced a 15.2% 12-month combined rental increase, with house rents rising the most, up 21.2% compared with this time last year. Adelaide and Canberra are the next worst hit, seeing a combined increase of 14.3%. Rental prices for houses in Sydney have gone up 19.1%, while Melbourne unit rents jumped the most, rising 11.5% in the past 12 months. Lauren Neiland recently decided to move, as her and her partner were expecting their first child and needed to upsize. They were able to break the lease of their Aspley property, north of central Brisbane, without having to pay fees. Neiland was lucky – her partner had just gotten a pay rise, and after eight rejections, they secured her “perfect home”. After moving out, the price of their former rental rose sharply from $420 to $525 a week. “We kept an eye on the listing out of curiosity to see how much they’d increase it by and was amazed,” she said. “They said they’d do all these repairs to it that it needed between tenancies but it was leased out the day after the bond clean. So clearly nothing was done.” SQM Research’s managing director, Louis Christopher, said the rental crisis had worsened in the past month with vacancy rates across Australia falling to just 1% in March, down from 1.2% in February. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It represents half the total number of vacant rentals reported a year ago and is the lowest national rate since 2006, at a time when cost of living is outpacing wage increases. The number of vacancies Australia-wide now stands at 36,868 properties, with smaller capital cities Hobart and Adelaide worst hit with a 0.3% vacancy rate. Sydney has a 1.6% vacancy rate, down from 3.4% in March last year, while Melbourne – hard-hit by Covid-19 lockdowns in the past two years – is sitting at 1.9%, down from 4.4%. “As a result, market rents have exploded,” Christopher said. “Some of our capital cities and regions are recording [as] asking rental increases in excess of 15% over the past 12 months … and the recent monthly data suggests we are still not at the worst point of the crisis. “It is likely homelessness will be increasing in this environment. Yet, when I consider the current election stances for the major and minor parties, there is a dearth of specific policy in addressing the issues surrounding housing affordability.” At the same time, expected relief for regional Australia as Covid restrictions ease and renters return to the cities has not eventuated, with many localities and townships recording zero vacancy rates. Parts of Ballarat, Gippsland, the Yarra ranges, the Dandenong ranges in Victoria and the Blue Mountains in New South Wales have no rentals available, as do suburbs in Hobart and Adelaide. Sonja Holness moved to Gippsland in regional Victoria with her family six years ago, when rental prices in the area were just starting to increase. “We were initially paying $250 a week for a four bedroom house with a decent yard,” she said. “We now pay $360 for a three bedroom home with no back yard and our landlord sharing the property. “We’re lucky, average rent here is $450 and above. My town has had a zero vacancy rate since 2018 … when we had to move in 2020 we applied for every property in a 50km radius, and were turned down for every one we applied for.” Holness says she only secured the property her family is in now as she knew the house was empty, and that the owners lived behind it. “We knocked on their door and were lucky they gave us a chance,” she said. “I was five days away from living in a caravan park with my partner and three kids. Things have only gotten worse. “There are more rentals now but people that rented here for their whole lives can’t afford them. It’s pushing people further out or back to the suburbs.” Rebecca Goldsmith has been applying for houses throughout regional Victoria since she was told her rental had been sold six weeks ago. Goldsmith was given a maximum 30 days’ notice to vacate her property, on the border of Victoria and New South Wales. “I’ve been applying for houses with no luck yet. I’m even applying for houses that are hours away,” she said. “I have three kids, I’m pregnant again and my youngest two are two and under. “The rental crisis is bullshit.” Goldsmith said she hadn’t been able to secure public housing, as none were vacant and her area had a significant waiting list. “Houses … aren’t really in my budget. A three bedroom in my area used to be around $250 a week. Now they are anywhere between $300 and $420 a week.”",News/Australia news,Rental prices in Australian capital cities spike by up to 21% as available housing plummets,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/13/rental-prices-in-australian-capital-cities-spike-by-up-to-21-as-available-housing-plummets
4/13/2022,"Authorities are investigating the death of a man who waited more than three hours on an ambulance stretcher for treatment at a regional hospital in Victoria. The 72-year-old man went into cardiac arrest and died on Monday afternoon after waiting about three-and-a-half hours for treatment at the Bairnsdale Regional Health Service in East Gippsland. Guardian Australia understands the man had been taken out of the ambulance and into the hospital at the time of his death. He was considered a low acuity case, but his condition deteriorated as he was left waiting in a corridor for a bed to become available in the emergency department. Bairnsdale Regional Health Service and Ambulance Victoria are conducting an investigation into the death. Senior Victorian government minister, Lisa Neville, said staff shortages due to Covid-19 have left the state’s health system “under huge pressure”. About 1,700 health workers were isolating on Tuesday, either having tested positive for the virus or as a close contact of an infected person, she said. “We also have had a number of staff who have left the service just because of the last couple of years,” Neville said. “We’re very conscious that our regional and rural hospitals are as under pressure as our metropolitan hospitals. We’ll have this investigation, but we’ll continue to support investment in rural and regional hospitals to make sure that people get the care that they’re entitled to.” The MP for Gippsland East, Tim Bull, said about 10% of staff at Bairnsdale hospital were off work due to Covid-19 at the time of the man’s death. “I know many people who work at the hospital, I know the sort of hours they’ve been working, the stress they’re dealing with and the strict framework of rules they’ve diligently navigated for more than two years – they’re our local heroes,” the Nationals MP said. “But they can only do so much when the rural health workforce is so underprepared and underresourced by state Labor – even before the massive strain and uncertainty of the pandemic. “They are just overwhelmed at the moment. Now we’ve got a local family in mourning.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Victorian Ambulance Union secretary, Danny Hill, said increased presentations at emergency departments across the state have meant ambulances are forced to wait – or “ramp” – outside hospitals for long periods of time with patients on board. “There’s ramping every single shift. There is no location where there isn’t ramping happening at some point over the last couple of months,” he said. Hill said most paramedics were treating patients who had deferred seeing their GP or having regular check-ups during lockdowns and are now experiencing more complex or critical problems. “They’re waiting until they’re critically unwell and then dialling triple zero. It puts much more strain on the system.

4/13/2022,"The full-time whistle had long been blown on the Matildas’ win over New Zealand when the emotion of Tuesday night reached its peak. On an empty pitch at Canberra’s GIO Stadium, players from both teams watched on in support as midfielder Aivi Luik’s head was shaved as part of a fundraising effort for brain tumour research. The 37-year-old had promised to go under the razor if she reached her target of $30,000 to honour her younger brother Noah Kerwick, 27, who was recently diagnosed with brain cancer. Having exceeded that amount after four days, she remained true to her word following Australia’s 3-1 win, allowing Football Ferns player Rebakkah Stott – herself a cancer survivor – to administer the haircut. Luik, who is based overseas and has not seen her brother since his diagnosis, had raised more than $37,000 for the Mark Hughes Foundation by Tuesday morning. “It’s so heart-warming to feel all that love and support,” Luik said. “Hair is always going to grow back, so why not? Honestly, every single person that donated is such a big hero.” Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson said the unusual scenes on the pitch at full-time were testament to the power of football and the unity of his team. “Apologies, I get emotional here because it’s so much more than football and this team shows that so much every day, and the way they came together with Aivi,” Gustavsson said. “She almost apologised a couple of days ago and said, ‘I don’t want this to be a disturbance’. And all of us said, ‘it’s never going to be a disturbance, this is what we’re about. We share our scars and we’re in this together’.” So much more than football ❤️#AUSvNZL pic.twitter.com/LGL4Bha0Ut Stott made an emotional return to football in December, less than a year after being diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma in early 2021. Her journey, which she chronicled in an online blog, drew huge support from the world of football. “We’re a big Matildas family, the past players, present players, the future players, their families, we’ve had babies in camp now,” Gustavsson said. “I’ve had the privilege at both games here to meet the family and friends group up in the stands when the team’s warming up and see how much they mean to these players. “And then to see Aivi doing that for her brother and do it with Stott as well, it’s so much more than football.” Ferns coach Jitka Klimková said it was an “incredible” moment to witness. “Being part of it and seeing how Aivi is approaching this hard, tough situation, it’s just unbelievable,” she said. “I’m just proud to be part of it. And I know Australian players and Kiwi players are very close, so I hope that everybody felt that kind of support from the Ferns.”",Sport/Football,‘So much more than football’: Matildas midfielder Aivi Luik shaves head for brain tumour research,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/13/so-much-more-than-football-matildas-midfielder-aivi-luik-shaves-head-for-brain-tumour-research
4/13/2022,"The news was delivered in just a few cold sentences. An appeal for clemency for Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, a man on death row whose case has prompted a global outcry, had failed. “Please be informed that the position...remains unchanged” wrote Singapore president’s principal private secretary, in a letter to Nagaenthran’s family: “The sentence of death therefore stands.” Nagaenthran’s relatives and supporters have campaigned tirelessly for his life to be spared. He was arrested in 2009, aged 21, for attempting to smuggle a small amount of heroin – about three tablespoons – into Singapore and has since spent more than a decade on death row. His lawyer has argued that he has an IQ of 69, a level recognised as indicating a learning disability, and should be protected from execution under international law. Nagaenthran has said he was coerced into carrying the drugs. Nagaenthran’s case has appalled rights groups, and provoked an outcry from voices around the world - from billionaire businessman Richard Branson, a critic of the death penalty, to EU representatives and UN experts. Domestically, it has also prompted some younger Singaporeans to question a system that the government has long claimed makes the city state “one of the safest places in the world”. “The death penalty is applicable only for a very limited number of offences, involving the most serious forms of harm to victims and to society, such as intentional murder and trafficking of significant quantities of drugs. We have put in place many judicial safeguards surrounding its use,” the government says. The Singapore government does not disclose how many people are on death row. Since 2019, eight death row prisoners have been given execution notices, placing them at imminent risk of hanging. One of these men was hanged last month. Death penalty cases are rarely reported in any detail in Singapore’s tightly controlled media, but Nagaenthran’s story has been shared widely online. Isaac Chiew, a 22-year-old university student, said he hadn’t thought very much about the death penalty, until he came across Nagaenthran’s case on Instagram. “Reading all the details really made me feel this sense of injustice,” he says. “It just made me feel - this could have been my friend or me in a different circumstance.” Nagaenthran was just a young man who had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, says Chiew. He began to read about others on death row, and was struck by stories of people who were condemned to death simply for falling in with the wrong crowd or making a mistake. Profiles of some death row inmates shared online by campaigners show they are not big time criminals, but rather men from marginalised communities who have faced poverty, or struggled with addiction. “Social media has allowed us to centre the voices of death row prisoners and their families,” says Jolovan Wham, a human rights activist. In a rare protest this month, more than 400 people turned out at Speakers’ Corner at Hong Lim park, the only place where demonstrations are permitted in Singapore, to call for executions to be halted. Kirsten Han, a journalist and activist who has spent a decade campaigning against the death penalty, believes its likely the highest turn out ever seen at such a demonstration. The message, too, was different. “Previously a lot of other death penalty events might have been focused on - give this person a chance,” said Han. But protesters were now critiquing the whole system. They weren’t, she added, just expressing pity for any one person; they were calling for abolition of the death penalty. Most of the attendees were young Singaporeans. The Singaporean authorities have shown no willingness to move towards dropping the death sentence, despite a global shift towards abolition, said Ariel Yin Yee Yap, a doctoral researcher and teaching associate at Monash University. “My research indicates a long pattern of state justification and legitimisation, to both the international community, and domestic audiences, [of] its continued practice of capital punishment,” she said. The government argues that capital punishment is the most effective deterrent against crime - an idea debunked by criminological research, she adds. Research suggests that the death penalty is supported by the overwhelming majority of Singaporeans - but that this is not an unconditional or strongly held view. A study by the National University of Singapore found that seven in 10 Singaporeans said they agreed with capital punishment in general, but that support fell when people were presented with different scenarios and asked to choose whether the person convicted should be executed. Support also depended heavily on the premise that it was a more effective deterrent than other forms of punishment, and that no errors were made when such sentences were administered. Research suggests the more information people have about the death penalty, the more their support wavers, said Han. “That’s part of the challenge. How do we give them these details when it can’t get into mainstream media?” Han hopes attitudes will change with time. But she adds that, public opinion aside, governments should still commit to abolishing the death penalty. “Human rights issues should not be subjected to whatever the majority votes for.” For Nagaenthran, there are no more procedural steps left. His last ditch appeal was rejected last month as baseless by Singapore’s top court. The clemency, now refused, was the only option left.",News/World news,Singapore hardens opinion against death penalty as ‘sense of injustice’ grows,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/singapore-hardens-opinion-against-death-penalty-as-sense-of-injustice-grows
4/13/2022,"Mathias Cormann has called on developed countries such as Australia to increase foreign aid funding, despite his previous role in a government that shaved billions of dollars from such assistance. Cormann, the former Australian finance minister who now leads the Paris-based OECD, said he wanted to deliver a “very strong message” to donor countries to increase official development assistance “and certainly not cut it”. The aid sector welcomed the comments on Wednesday and called on Australia’s major political parties to commit during the federal election campaign to increasing the aid budget. Australia ranks 21st out of 29 developed countries when foreign aid spending is measured as a share of gross national income, OECD figures released late on Tuesday showed. Australia’s offical development assistance (ODA) rose 4.5% between 2020 and 2021 due to an increase in bilateral grants amid renewed Covid-related support, but this still represented just 0.22% of Australia’s gross national income. The most generous countries analysed by the OECD were Luxembourg (0.99%), Norway and Sweden, while Australia was a few places behind New Zealand (0.28%) but slightly ahead of the US (0.18%). The figures were released by Cormann, who successfully campaigned for the post of OECD secretary general with the Australian government’s strong backing. In the Abbott government’s first budget, delivered in 2014 when Cormann was finance minister, the Coalition announced it would save $7.9bn from the aid budget over five years. That was achieved by maintaining ODA at $5bn a year, with plans to resume indexation from 2016-17. But the midyear update released by Joe Hockey and Cormann in December 2014 foreshadowed extra savings from the aid budget of $3.7bn over four years. In then treasurer Scott Morrison’s 2018 budget, the government announced it would freeze ODA spending at $4bn per year, before resuming indexation in 2022-23. Cormann was asked on Tuesday night whether he saw a danger that donor countries would cut development funds for poor countries in light of the war in Ukraine. “I hope not,” he said. “And so far, the evidence is to the contrary. I mean, so far, the evidence is that ODA funding has been very resilient, has continued to grow, despite some very serious fiscal constraints that have been faced by governments in donor countries.” Cormann said Russia’s “unprovoked war of aggression against the people of Ukraine” could lead to broader “negative consequences in terms of food security, food, affordability, and general impacts in terms of poverty across other parts of the world”. “So the need is going to be higher, not less,” Cormann said. Cormann said the latest OECD figures “give us a lot of hope that the trend is heading in the right direction, despite some of the challenges faced in recent times, and we would like to think that this will continue into the future”. The Australian Council for International Development said New Zealand, Iceland, Spain and Hungary all ranked higher than Australia in their contributions as a percentage of gross national income. The council’s chief executive officer, Marc Purcell, said Australia must put ODA increases on a long-term footing. “We need to return to investing 0.5% of our income in development cooperation and humanitarian assistance. This was once a bipartisan commitment,” Purcell said. “The Greens have committed to 0.7%, while Labor has vowed to reach 0.5%. While we have welcomed the Coalition government’s $1.5bn in extra investment in recent years, it has not set out where it wants to take the international development budget. We need all parties to agree to 0.5 and a timetable to get there.” Purcell said developing countries were “bearing the brunt of Covid-19 and the knock-on effects of crises like Ukraine”. He said this year about 274 million people would need humanitarian assistance and protection, with needs escalating in the Sahel, Yemen, Afghanistan and Myanmar. More broadly, the OECD data released by Cormann showed foreign aid from official donors rose to an all-time high of $US179bn in 2021, up 4.4% in real terms from 2020. Cormann defended aid cuts in December 2014, saying the government was doing so “reluctantly” and would “rather if we didn’t have to” but he blamed the Labor opposition for opposing other savings. “Essentially we didn’t have much choice,” the then finance minister said. In March 2015, Cormann said he thought the government had “done as much as we can” in making savings in foreign aid. However, the government continued to make further savings from this part of the budget. In May 2018, Cormann defended the budget decision to freeze spending at $4bn a year, saying this level was “appropriate” until “we are back in a strong and sustainable surplus position”. It is not the first pivot since Cormann assumed the OECD position. Last year, Cormann said carbon pricing and equivalent measures “need to become significantly more stringent, and globally better coordinated, to properly reflect the cost of emissions to the planet and put us on the path to genuinely meet the Paris agreement climate goals”. The Abbott government repealed Australia’s carbon pricing scheme.",News/Business,Mathias Cormann calls for greater foreign aid despite role in Australian cuts,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/13/mathias-cormann-calls-for-greater-foreign-aid-despite-role-in-australian-cuts
