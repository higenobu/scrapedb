5/12/2022,"Doctor Strange actress Zara Phythian and her husband, Victor Marke, have been convicted of multiple charges of child sex abuse in a British court. According to a document provided to EW by the Nottingham Crown Court clerk, 37-year-old Phythian — who was tried under the name Zara Marke — was convicted of 14 counts, with her 59-year-old husband convicted of 18. The counts for Phythian all relate to sexual activity with a child that occurred between December 2005 and December 2008. She is named alongside Marke in all of her charges, though he is individually included on four additional indecent assault charges (for actions dating back to September 2002) as an individual. Marke's offenses include indecent assault of a 15-year-old victim, while both were convicted of multiple counts of sexual activity with another underage victim beginning when she was 13. Their actions span multiple years and repeated occasions involving the same victim. Anthony Harvey/Getty Images Zara Phythian at the 'Doctor Strange' premiere in 2016. Phythian has two dozen credits listed on IMDb, the most notable being a small role in the 2016 Doctor Strange blockbuster opposite Benedict Cumberbatch as a ""Brunette Zealot."" She does not appear in the sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Per BBC reporting, Marke claimed that the sexual activity occurred on only one occasion, and that Phythian was not involved alongside him. Phythian reportedly denied any sexual activity with one of the victims. Judge Mark Watson remanded the couple into custody following the trial, ahead of their May 16 sentencing. ""Both of you know the sentence I pass on 16 May is likely to be measured by a considerable period of custody,"" he said at the trial. Nicole Hepburn from the Crown Prosecution Service said that Phythian and Marke were ""exposed as the true liars"" in the case, after the victims initially reported the pair years after the abuse began. ""This abuse may have occurred some years ago, but that makes it no less serious and nor is it a barrier to justice,"" Hepburn continued, according to the BBC. ""I would encourage anyone who has been abused in the past to come forward with the knowledge that the CPS will take your case seriously.""

5/12/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin had plans to take all of Ukraine, according to abandoned Russian documents which Ukrainian authorities reportedly found in the Ukrainian town of Trostyanets in Sumy Oblast. The documents, which Ukrainian authorities said they found while investigating Trostyanets, a northeastern Ukrainian town Russian troops occupied for a month during the war, suggest that while Russia is currently focusing its attacks on the Donbas in eastern Ukraine, Putin’s ambitions lie far beyond the east. “Investigators… found important documents of soldiers of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces that give a clear understanding that Russia was preparing to seize all the territory of Ukraine,” Ukraine’s State Bureau of Investigation Chief Oleksiy Sukhachev said in a statement. “All this information will be studied.” The Russian forces that occupied Trostyanets had set up a headquarters in the town’s train station, according to France 24. The Russian military was using Trostyanets as a passage route to make way for tanks to head towards the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in an effort to seize the capital, The New York Times reported. But the Russian military met a flurry of resistance from the Ukrainians on the way, and eventually backed off their plans to take the capital, making the plans to pass through Trostyanets transform into more of an occupation. As Russian forces regrouped and refocused their invasion on Eastern Ukraine, Ukrainians liberated the town. Top U.S. Spy Spills on Putin’s ‘Drastic’ Secret Plan to Win War The Daily Beast has not independently verified the documents. But Putin’s alleged plans to occupy all of Ukraine appear to confirm assessments from western nations and U.S. intelligence officials that the Kremlin’s plans in Ukraine have been expansive and aimed at overtaking more than just Eastern Ukraine. When Putin launched the invasion in February, he announced a “special military operation” aimed at Eastern Ukraine. But the announcement masked his true aims, according to U.S. intelligence community assessments. His aim was to take Kyiv swiftly and in a matter of days, CIA Director Bill Burns said in testimony on Capitol Hill in March. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has assessed that Putin planned to control all of Ukraine entirely. “We have seen no indication that President Putin has changed his ambition to control the whole of Ukraine and also to rewrite the international order,” NATO’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in April. Even Russian military leaders have admitted their goals in Ukraine are greater than the current fight in Eastern Ukraine and that they want “full control” of both the east and southern portions of Ukraine. “Since the beginning of the second stage of the special operation… one of the tasks of the Russian army has been to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine,” Central Military District Commander Rustam Minnekayev said in late April. “That will ensure the opening of a land corridor to Crimea and influence critical elements of the Ukrainian economy.” And while Russian forces had to refocus their efforts on just the eastern regions of Ukraine following a series of fumbles and logistical errors in efforts to take Kyiv and attack in the west of Ukraine, Putin will not be ending the fight in Eastern Ukraine, in all likelihood, top U.S. intelligence officials are warning this week. Just Tuesday, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers in a brief that Putin has his sights set on other regions beyond Eastern Ukraine. “We assess President Putin is preparing for prolonged conflict in Ukraine during which he still intends to achieve goals beyond the Donbas,” Haines said. A senior U.S. defense official said in a call Tuesday Putin may not have given up entirely on his original aims in Ukraine. “It’s not clear to us the degree to which any of Mr. Putin's strategic objectives have changed,” the senior official said. “We don't know that he's given up on Kyiv particularly.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/12/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee asked the Justice Departmen t on Wednesday to investigate whether a Trump administration interior secretary engaged in possible criminal conduct while helping an Arizona developer get a crucial permit for a housing project. The criminal referral says David Bernhardt pushed for approval of the project by developer Michael Ingram, a Republican donor and supporter of former President Donald Trump, despite a federal wildlife official's finding that it would threaten habitats for imperiled species. Bernhardt led Interior from 2019 to 2021. In 2017, he was the No. 2 official at the department when the Fish and Wildlife Service, an Interior Department agency, reversed its opposition to the Villages at Vigneto, the proposed 28,000-home development in southern Arizona, and allowed it to move forward. Democrat Reps. Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, the committee chairman, and Katie Porter of California, who leads a subcommittee on oversight and investigations. made the referral in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland. They said the committee has conducted an extensive investigation into the circumstances surrounding the 2017 decision. A high-ranking interior official had said issuing a Clean Water Act permit for the project could adversely affect endangered species or critical habitat in the area. The region is home to birds such as as the southwestern willow flycatcher and yellow-billed cuckoo, as well as the northern Mexican garter snake. In their referral, Democrats say Ingram met with Bernhardt in August 2017, two weeks before a Fish and Wildlife official received the phone call directing him to reverse the decision blocking the project. The meeting was not disclosed in Bernhardt’s public calendar or travel documents. Two months later, Ingram made a $10,000 donation to the Trump Victory Fund. The permit was approved later that month. At least nine other donors associated with Ingram also donated to the Trump Victory Fund in the days after Ingram's donation, Democrats said. “Evidence strongly suggests the decision was the result of a quid pro quo between Vigneto’s developer, Michael Ingram, and senior level officials in the Trump administration,'' including Bernhardt, who was then the deputy Interior secretary, the Democrats wrote. Ingram ""had frequent access to high-ranking officials across the Trump administration,'' including Bernhardt, then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and then-Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, Democrats said. Zinke, who led Interior from March 2017 to January 2019, met with Ingram in May 2017 and April 2018, the Democrats said in documents submitted with the referral. Zinke and his staff emailed Ingram multiple times, using personal email addresses, Democrats said. Bernhardt, now a lawyer in private practice, did not return calls and an email requesting comment. A Justice Department spokesman said the department received the letter and will review it. The lawmakers asked Garland to investigate and consider bringing criminal charges against Bernhardt or other officials. ""The findings of this investigation show us yet again that the previous administration cast career staff expertise aside while they handed out federal agency decisions to Trump’s buddies and big donors on a pay-to-play basis,” Grijalva said in a statement. Porter said that “an exchange of money for a specific government action is the clearest form of corruption there is, and Americans — Democrats, Republicans and independents — share an understanding that this kind of quid pro quo erodes our democracy.” Lanny Davis, a lawyer for El Dorado Holdings, a company owned by Ingram, called the referral by Grijalva and Porter “false, misleading (and) unfair"" and said it used ""innuendo as a surrogate for fact.'' El Dorado participated in multiple meetings with the committee, ""acted in full transparency and gave full cooperation without a subpoena,'' Davis said in a statement. Even so, the company was denied the opportunity to rebut the allegations in the referral or even a chance to speak to Grijalva, Davis said. ""Unfortunately, the American people have been numbed and accustomed to political attacks that have little to do with the truth, and there needs to be bipartisan outrage when this occurs,'' added Davis, a prominent Democrat who was special counsel to former President Bill Clinton. ___ Associated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.",Politics/Associated Press,Democrats seek criminal charges against Trump Interior head,https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-seek-criminal-charges-against-175807316.html
