5/15/2022,"Sometimes a miss really is as good as a mile. Wembley was a fevered place at the end of this gruelling, apparently endless FA Cup final. As the Liverpool players capered at the eastern end of the ground, lost in a fog of red smoke, tumbling and rolling on the grass in front of a stand that seemed a single mess of limbs and light and noise, the contrast in the other half of the pitch was unavoidably stark. Chelsea’s players sat, bereft, on the turf as the end behind them emptied out. And at that moment these two entities seemed to be heading in entirely opposite directions. For Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool this is now a definitive, era-marking season, two domestic cups in the bag and another final to come, the semi-impossible dream of the quad still there. For 120 minutes Wembley had provided a point of intersection for these two clubs, roped together once again on this stage, chasing the late afternoon sun. But like trains hitting the points and shearing off on their own arc, the sense of separation felt profound at the end. For Chelsea this was always a chance to say goodbye to something. The Age of Abramovich has been pegged out around these summer beanos, the Metropolitan line north thronged with blue shirts and pink flesh, the sense of a stroll, a spree, a flag day. There will be more of these days, other glories, other eras, other billionaires But nothing quite like that endlessly giving hand. And there would be no Viking funeral here. Whereas for Liverpool the Klopp supremacy keeps rolling on. This, it turns out, is the sweet spot. How far can it run on from here? There had been a sense that the thing Klopp has built needed a little filing at the edges. Up until the spring of this season a total of two trophies felt a little light for six years of furious progress, for the memories, the style, the imprint made on English football. An FA Cup win at Wembley feels like another shade in the palette, a rounding out. It also nudges the current season on to a genuinely thrilling denouement. What is this thing now? How high can it go? Scroll through the all-time lists and Liverpool’s greatest ever season is probably 1983-84, when they won the league, League Cup and European Cup. Three years previously they won a League Cup and European Cup double. In 2001 there was another treble, FA Cup, League Cup and Uefa Cup. Triumphing in the current title race looks a very long shot from here. But should Liverpool beat Real Madrid in two weeks’ time Klopp’s side are looking at a domestic cup double, plus champions of Europe, plus 90-odd points in the league. It would be one of the great Liverpool seasons; one of the great English seasons. That final European step looks more daunting after the loss of Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk to injuries here. But two weeks is a decent cushion. And victory here will also speak to Paris, and that shot at the sun. Liverpool will travel light. There is just something about this team and finals. The margins are, of course, fine: penalties at the end of 120 minutes, the width of a post, a one-handed save. But somehow it always felt like the day was heading that way. Wembley had been a delicious, sunlit spectacle before kick-off, the pitch jammed with so many pre-match sideshows – the band, a flag, some soldiers, Pete Tong and his record player. Last year had been a meagre, plague-football affair. This, by contrast, was all the toys in the bag, the full flush of smoke, noise, tongues of fire. But yeah, you kind of knew how it was going to the end, even then. Chelsea were poor early on, a team that didn’t seem to know how to move forward, how to take the ball up the pitch, where to make it stick. For Liverpool Luis Díaz was electric, skating inside with that easy gliding style, a footballer who is completely unafraid, who will take you into those horrible spaces and stretch you thin. The afternoon began to unwind from that point. By the end, two hours in, the sun had faded to a watery glaze. The players sunk into a huddle by the touchline, draping themselves in towels. The Chelsea physio pounded the thighs of Trevoh Chalobah like man kneading a batch of prized sourdough. And by that stage the rolling total stood at 420 minutes between these two teams, stretching back to August last year, without an edge between them, outside that extended penalty shootout in the spring. Liverpool had looked a little lacking in peak freshness, although they kept running even as the game began to set around them. It fell to Mason Mount to miss the decisive penalty, striking it well enough, but seeing Alisson make a brilliant one-handed save. Kostas Tsimikas rolled the ball into the corner and in that moment the day finally split in two. For Liverpool there is the delicious symmetry of a domestic cup double, a feeling of some marker left in the record books. Klopp finally has a toehold with domestic cups: this was his third in the last 10 years, his second in three months. Thoughts will now turn to the chance to gorge at the season’s end, and to a kind of ultimacy that is now within this team’s grasp.",Sport/Football,Chelsea match Liverpool but Jürgen Klopp’s side have sense of destiny | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/14/chelsea-match-liverpool-but-jurgen-klopps-side-have-sense-of-destiny
5/15/2022,"Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool’s “mentality monsters” filled him with pride after keeping hopes of an unprecedented quadruple alive by winning the club’s first FA Cup for 16 years. In a repeat of the Carabao Cup final, Liverpool beat Chelsea in a penalty shootout following a goalless 120 minutes to clinch an eighth FA Cup and second trophy of a remarkable season. Alisson and Kostas Tsimikas were Liverpool’s heroes in the penalty shootout. The Brazil international saved from Mason Mount before the “Greek Scouser”, as Tsimikas is known at Liverpool, converted his team’s seventh penalty. Sadio Mané had earlier missed the chance to win the shootout when his penalty, Liverpool’s fifth, was saved by Éduoard Mendy. The Liverpool manager said: “Outstanding, it was an incredible, intense game against Chelsea – they would have deserved it exactly the same way, like in the Carabao Cup – that’s how small the margins are. I couldn’t be more proud of my boys, the shift they put in, how hard they fought, early changes. All of these things, missing good chances, overcoming good moments from Chelsea, then having really good moments ourselves. “Then in the penalty shootout, it was nerve-racking, my nails are gone but I really feel for Chelsea – for the second time, 120 minutes and you get nothing, that’s too hard. But for us I’m pretty happy. We are mentality monsters but there were mentality monsters in blue as well – it was one penalty. Chelsea played outstanding but in the end there must be one winner and that was us today.” Alisson claimed the victory would help Liverpool in their pursuit of adding the Premier League title and Champions League to this season’s trophy haul. The Liverpool goalkeeper said: “That is part of the mentality monsters, going to extra time and keeping the high level, performing well. It gives us even more confidence to keep on going for the Premier League and also the Champions League final. This is a fantastic moment and now we just need to enjoy it.” Two key players for Liverpool, Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk, were substituted due to groin and knee problems respectively, although Klopp confirmed both were withdrawn as a precaution with the Premier League title and Champions League final still to play for. “Mo is a bit more than Virj,” said the Liverpool manager, who has now completed a clean sweep of English domestic trophies. “Virj has little problems. If he played 120 minutes that would have been really crazy. Mo said ‘I could carry on but I feel a little bit’ so I thought take him off.” The Netherlands international, who was replaced by Joel Matip ahead of extra time, confirmed: “I felt a little twinge behind my knee in the first half. I played on but I couldn’t risk it in extra-time. Hopefully it will be fine.” Chelsea, by contrast, set a new and unwanted record of three FA Cup final defeats in a row. Thomas Tuchel insisted he had no regrets about his side’s performance at Wembley, where Timo Werner suffered a hamstring problem in the warm-up and Kai Havertz was unavailable due to a similar injury. The Chelsea manager said: “Like in the Carabao Cup we have no regrets. I told the team I am proud. We were competitive and made life difficult for Liverpool. We struggled for the first 15 minutes but then we were excellent throughout the whole match against the most dangerous attacking team in the whole world. We lost on penalties. We are sad but at the same time proud. I was sure before and during the match that we would win. Unfortunately I was not right.” Tuchel introduced Ruben Loftus-Cheek in extra time as a makeshift forward only to substitute the midfielder 14 minutes later. “It was purely for penalties,” the manager confirmed. “Ruben doesn’t have a good history with penalties and Ross [Barkley] has.”",Sport/Football,‘It was incredible’: Jürgen Klopp proud of Liverpool’s FA Cup win over Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/14/it-was-incredible-jurgen-klopp-proud-of-liverpools-fa-cup-win-over-chelsea
