2/1/2022,"Production of carbon dioxide for use in producing meat, beer and fizzy drinks has been secured for at least three months under a new industry deal. Meat processors, brewers, bakers and soft drink producers all use CO2 in making and packaging their goods. It is also required for the humane slaughter of animals including pigs and chickens, and is used by hospitals and nuclear power plants.  A short government statement said a new deal would enable CF Fertiliser plant in Billingham, County Durham, to continue to operate. The plant was scheduled for potential shutdown this week after a three-month emergency deal brokered by the government came to an end on Monday. That deal was prompted by a crisis in CO2 supplies in late September as high energy prices combined with annual maintenance shutdowns to bring UK production to a near halt. The government was forced to use taxpayer money to fund a three-week bailout for CF Industries, which accounts for 60% of the UK’s CO2 supplies, to stave off supply chain chaos before the first three-month deal was agreed. The business department said in a statement: “The government welcomes the industry’s agreement which is in the best interest of businesses.” It added that in the longer term the government would “like to see the market take measures to improve resilience, and we are engaging on ways this could happen”.",News/Business,UK government agrees three-month carbon dioxide deal,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/01/business-department-agrees-three-month-carbon-dioxide-deal
2/1/2022,"Metropolitan police officers were caught sharing messages about hitting and raping women, and making racist and homophobic remarks, as part of a an offensive culture in Britain’s biggest force, an official report has revealed. The officers were based mainly at the Charing Cross police station in central London, with the offending behaviour taking place between 2016 and 2018.  The messages also included a reference to the Holocaust, deaths of black babies and violence against the public, with the conduct amounting to bullying and harassment, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) watchdog found. The messages were shared among a group of up to 19 officers, with the hateful and offensive remarks part of a Met culture that needed to be rooted out, the IOPC said. The revelations come as the Met faces pressure and inquiries into its culture after Wayne Couzens used his position as a police officer to kidnap, rape and murder Sarah Everard. It is also under pressure over its handling of investigations into Downing Street parties. The IOPC released extensive details of the messages shared via WhatsApp or Facebook among members of the squad, which has now been broken up. Examples of the offensive messages included: One male officer wrote to a female officer: “I would happily rape you … if I was single … if I was single I would happily chloroform you.” Another officer talked about getting women into bed and advocated violence: “Getting a woman into bed is like spreading butter. It can be done with a bit of effort using a credit card, but it’s quicker and easier just to use a knife.” Police officers wrote about attending a festival dressed as known sex offenders and a molested child. “Numerous messages about rape and ‘raping’ each other” were sent in two WhatsApp group and one Facebook group. One officer messaged another saying he was going to attack his partner and wrote: “Swear to got [sic] I’m going to smack her”. Another message shows an officer bragging about visiting a sex worker when he was using steroids. The IOPC said those officers who knew about the messages had been afraid to challenge or report it. Its report said: “Several spoke of how when people spoke out about this behaviour, they were harassed, humiliated and excluded. Challenging sexual harassment led to additional problems. “Female officers told us they would be treated as the ‘weary female’, told it was part of police culture, that they should accept, ‘play the game or stay quiet’, or leave. We also obtained evidence that reports of sexual harassment were not dealt with sensitively within the MPS [Metropolitan police service].” Messages sent between the officers threatened those who were thinking about breaking the silence, including: “There’s a few of those grassing c***s I would like to knife.” The IOPC said the messages showed attitudes that left ethnic minority and female staff in fear and could show officers being discriminatory to their colleagues and staff. The officers also shared a series of racist messages. These included: “PWPEHCLM – People with pre-existing heart conditions lives matter. Should of offered him a kit kat and a nice lie down. Murdering cunts” and “Bring all the lefties I say, we can sing ‘cum by ya’ and embrace our multi gender/ethnic and sexual backgrounds whilst denouncing all the fascists in the MET.” There were also messages containing abuse against Muslims and disabled people. The IOPC said the behaviour was part of an offensive Met police culture, not just rogue individuals. “We believe these incidents are not isolated or simply the behaviour of a few ‘bad apples’.” The watchdog added: “The culture of bullying appears to have been accepted and not challenged. A reason for not reporting such behaviour was a lack of confidence that it would be dealt with effectively and fear of repercussions. In one case, allegations of bullying were not dealt with effectively or promptly by the supervisor who was in a relationship with the person making the allegations.” Of 14 officers investigated, two were sacked for gross misconduct, and banned from being police officers again. Misconduct was proven against another two, with one officer receiving a written warning, while another four faced measures to improve their performance. Bas Javid, the Met deputy assistant commissioner, said: “I am angry and disappointed to see officers involved in sharing sexist, racist and discriminatory messages. It’s clear we have a lot of work to do to ensure bullying and discrimination does not exist in any part of the Met. “The actions of these officers between 2016 and 2018 were unacceptable, unprofessional, disrespectful and deeply offensive. I read their messages with increasing disgust and shame. We recognise that there is need for real change in the Met.” The IOPC said it reviewed thousands of messages and some officers tried to defend them claiming that they were “banter”, an excuse that was not accepted. Sal Naseem of the IOPC said: “The relationship between the police and the public is critical to maintaining the principle of policing by consent. The concerns about behaviour and culture addressed in our report, if allowed to continue and go unchallenged, risked causing serious damage to that relationship.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “I am utterly disgusted by the behaviour outlined in this IOPC report, which details the shocking evidence of discrimination, misogyny, harassment and bullying by police officers. The conduct of these officers was totally unacceptable and what has been revealed by these investigations will only further damage public trust and confidence in the police.”",News/UK news,"Met officers joked about raping women, police watchdog reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/01/met-officers-joked-raping-women-police-watchdog-racist
2/1/2022,"A man who stabbed to death his ex-partner in west London was wanted by the police for breaching a stalking prevention order, an inquest has heard. Yasmin Chkaifi, 43, died from multiple stab wounds when she was attacked by her former partner, Leon McCaskie, 38, at about 9am on 24 January in Chippenham Road, Maida Vale, the inquest into her death was told.  It also heard that McCaskie was then killed when he was driven into by a passing motorist who was trying to stop the attack. Giving evidence, DCI Neil Rawlinson said McCaskie and Chkaifi had been in a relationship that ended years ago after “allegations of domestic abuse”. He confirmed that McCaskie, who lived “very close” to his ex-partner, had been subject to a stalking prevention order and had been charged with breaching it. A warrant was issued for McCaskie’s arrest on 4 January when he failed to appear for his first court hearing about the breach, Rawlinson said. He also confirmed that the Metropolitan police’s handling of McCaskie’s case was being examined by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Reading his statement about the attack, Rawlinson said: “Leon accosted Yasmin in the street and repeatedly stabbed her with a knife. A member of the public, in a passing car, saw this, and used his vehicle to drive into Leon in an attempt to stop the assault. Both Leon and Yasmin were declared deceased at the scene.” Rawlinson, who leads the investigation, said police had secured CCTV footage of the attack and taken statements from several witnesses. The hearing was also told that Dr Simon Poole, a forensic pathologist, gave the interim cause of death as “multiple incised stab wounds”. Prof Fiona Wilcox, the senior coroner for inner west London, expressed her shock at the manner of Chkaifi’s death and conveyed sympathy to her family. Chkaifi’s two teenage sons, her husband, Joseph Salmon, and other members of the family were watching the proceedings via video link. Addressing the family, Wilcox said: “It is a truly shocking and distressing death, and I cannot imagine what you must be going through as a family at this time.” Wilcox formally opened and adjourned the inquest until 25 July. She said she hoped there would be a “significant update from the IOPC investigation” by then. Wilcox also opened and adjourned a separate inquest into the death of McCaskie. The interim cause of his death was given as “multiple injuries”, she said. Addressing McCaskie’s mother, Angela, who was listening to the proceedings remotely, the coroner said: “I am terribly sorry that you have lost your son in such awful circumstances.”",News/Society,"Maida Vale knife killer was wanted for stalking breach, inquest hears",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/01/maida-vale-knife-killer-was-wanted-for-stalking-breach-inquest-hears
2/1/2022,"Two points about the Ukraine crisis are crystal clear. First, Vladimir Putin wishes to reimpose Russian control over Ukraine, whatever the price. His political dream of restoring the Soviet sphere of influence is echoed in a wishlist of “security guarantees” presented to western governments by Russia in December 2021. Nato, he maintains, should return to the pre-1997 state of affairs; Russia, apparently, need not. Second, whatever Putin decides in the current crisis, there are real fears in central and eastern Europe that settled borders are now under threat. These fears are grounded in reason. What seemed unrealistic in the immediate post-cold war years is now again a real possibility. Questions about our collective safety and security have returned, along with memories of a traumatic and not so remote past.  More precisely, we are talking about more than one fear. Central and eastern European angst is existential in nature. In the 1980s, the Czech-French writer Milan Kundera wrote that small nations are constantly anxious about their existence, because their independence is repeatedly questioned. As doubt is cast even over their presence on the map, they experience their sovereignty in a fragile, nervous way. The Russian military menace to Ukraine reawakens old traumas and, paradoxically, not only those generated from the east. Another angst is, to put it bluntly, that the west will again abandon us. Historical precedent for western inaction is used in the current discourse to support doing nothing. The Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins, for example, noted, as he argued against Nato military intervention in Ukraine, that the west “wisely” did not intervene in Hungary in 1956 or in Czechoslovakia in 1968. For central and eastern Europeans, drawing such parallels proves that the Russians are not the only ones who persist with framing today’s events in terms of the cold war. The Ukraine crisis can be interpreted profoundly differently depending on which side of the old iron curtain you sit. This difference of perspective provokes its own misinterpretations and distrust. The evacuation of embassy staff from Kyiv may be understood as a “prudent precautionary measure” from the UK perspective; but for people in central and eastern Europe, it can have quite a different meaning. It suggests a readiness to withdraw that reawakens for us the trauma of being forced to be a part of the Soviet bloc. The instability of US foreign policy in recent years is another source of anxiety for central and eastern European countries, not least because the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan has forced many US allies to reconsider their strategic security priorities. But why should one listen to eastern Europeans’ anxieties, anyway, especially given the ambiguity their governments demonstrate towards the EU and the rule of law? It is worth remembering that the governments of Poland and Hungary have electoral legitimacy but don’t fully represent their polarised societies, not to mention the entire region. Yet, in Warsaw, Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn, the mood is full of anxiety. Nervous questions are asked: are western governments reliable allies? Why not defend Ukraine with full conviction? Why not rethink the geopolitical context of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if upholding “European” values means anything? Many citizens of central and eastern Europe have clear memories of living under Moscow’s rule. For them, 30 years of independence is not long enough to banish the worry that we are trapped in a cycle of ever-repeating history. A cold war framing of the Ukraine crisis undermines, imperceptibly perhaps, democratic legitimacy in the whole region. Thinking in terms of spheres of influence takes us back to a time when the Soviet Union’s satellite countries were unable to freely decide which military alliance or political regime they aspired to belong to. What should be remembered today is that, during the Euromaidan crisis in 2013 and 2014, there were Ukrainians ready to sacrifice their lives to join Europe. The EU and Nato were founded to prevent history from repeating itself: if the west is really committed to democratic values, it should defend Ukraine. Western countries should not accept a return to the outdated logic of spheres of influence. A decisive response to Putin’s belligerence is needed. At the moment, that is a diplomatic one. The so-called Normandy format talks, involving France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia, should continue in expanded form with the US, in an effort to de-escalate the crisis. But any western decision will have far-reaching consequences for Europe. Further geopolitical instability would affect central and eastern Europe militarily, economically and in terms of migration. There is also a risk that this geopolitical distress could reinforce the region’s turn towards nationalism. Fear, as Cardinal de Retz famously remarked, is the passion that weakens judgment most.

2/1/2022,"As winter approached the situation appeared perilous. Not only was the UK in the midst of a Covid pandemic, but experts feared familiar respiratory viruses could also hit hard. “I will emphasise that actually flu could be potentially a bigger problem this winter than Covid,” Prof Anthony Harnden, the deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme in June.  The concern was that lockdown and other measures had not only reduced coronavirus infection levels, but also the global circulation of influenza. According to the Royal College of General Practitioners, the prevalence of flu in the community in England was about 95% lower in the winter of 2020-21 than normal. The upshot, experts said, was that immunity in the population would have waned, leaving people more vulnerable to flu. And that could put further pressure on an already stretched NHS. Nevertheless, flu has yet to deliver on the threat. According to the latest report from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), “laboratory indicators suggest that influenza activity is very low,” with a similar picture seen in other metrics such as online searches for flu queries. One important factor is that in many countries, Covid measures have remained in place over the winter, and even where restrictions have eased, behaviour has yet to fully bounce back to pre-pandemic form. According to data from CoMix study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, on average adults had just below three contacts per day during December and January – compared with slightly more than 10 according to pre-pandemic surveys. “Maybe we’ve dodged the flu for now. But we’re now waiting for its inevitable grizzly return,” said Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group. “The flu stayed away because global application of social distancing measures and mask wearing have been enough to keep the virus at bay.” Another factor is that in the run-up to winter, the UK rolled out the largest flu vaccination programme in its history, with 35 million people offered the vaccine. According to latest UKHSA data, uptake among people aged 65 years and over is the highest on record at almost 82%. While low levels of flu means vaccines have had little opportunity to have a big impact, it is reasonable to assume they may have helped prevent some sickness. But the concern remains what will happens once society begins to return to something akin to “normal”. Pollard said: “That could mean that there is an unseasonal outbreak of flu that happens as all the social distancing and restrictions start to be released around the world if there’s enough susceptible individuals that the amount of flu can build up quite rapidly,” said Pollard, although he added outbreaks may not be seen until next winter when conditions are more favourable for its spread.” Dr Laurence Tiley, senior lecturer in molecular virology at the University of Cambridge, also urged caution. “The further we get into February, the more confident we can be that this season will turn out to be a good one,” he said, adding the situation seemed promising. But, he noted: “All bets are off for next season, of course.” Tiley said that, as well as the problem of waning immunity, the low prevalence of the virus made it harder to predict the best candidate for next season’s flu vaccine. “I think we have been extraordinarily fortunate how things have turned out this winter, with Omicron – and apparently for flu too,” he said. “Long may it remain so.”",News/World news,Has flu fizzled out?

If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email.  Despite the hundreds of happy hours I spent playing Guitar Hero in the late 00s, I feel slightly resentful towards it. In my late teens I was a decent player of the actual guitar, but Guitar Hero was so much more fun that I ended up ditching my actual instrument and playing that instead. I became superhumanly good at it, and meanwhile I remain an average player of the real guitar to this day. What might have happened if I’d spent all those hours learning my real instrument? Obviously Guitar Hero is the sole reason I’m not currently embarking on my seventh stadium tour. It’s rare that video game and real-world interests conflict. Most of the time the things we happily do in video games would be unbelievably boring in real life. Actual farming is arduous and complex and involves horribly early mornings; Stardew Valley or Minecraft farming is soothing and simple and can be done in bed at 1am when you can’t sleep. I would rather defenestrate myself than be an urban planner, and yet SimCity is ridiculously compelling. (Check out Dorfromantik if you liked those old city-planning games, by the way – it’s a similar principle but much more chill, getting you to create and expand idyllic rural landscapes.) This feels weird to admit in regular society, but I’ve built up a significant knowledge base of some sports and interests without ever having done them in the real world. I have an abiding love of golf that is confined exclusively to video games, for instance. It began with Mario Golf on the Nintendo 64 and continued through to Everybody’s Golf on various PlayStation consoles, via the fab little role-playing Mario golf games on the Game Boy (low-key some of the best sports games in history, if you ask me, because they let you write your own wee rags-to-riches story). I even became briefly obsessed with a Korean online golf game called PangYa in the early days of broadband internet, largely because my caddie was a paper bag with a cat face drawn on it. What I love about golf games is their calming predictability. You can make your calculations, know your drive distance, check the wind direction, add spin with a deft touch of an analogue stick, and send the ball rolling beautifully on to the green or into the hole. You rarely, if ever, mess up your swing. If you get into trouble in a bunker, you can usually get out of it without entirely ruining your round. I feel like I’m amazing at virtual golf. Oh, and the courses have interesting novelties like floating islands or moving platforms or piranha plants that gobble up your ball. Things are rarely boring. In real life? None of that holds true. Golf is awful in real life. I know because my dad loves it, and for my entire life he has come home on a Saturday afternoon after five pitiless hours on Scottish golf courses in a raging mood that morphed slowly into despair by Sunday morning. Unless, presumably, you are extremely good at it, real golf is boring, unpredictable and dispiriting. Even people who like golf know this to be true. See also: skateboarding. I met the directors behind the excellent new skateboarding game OlliOlli World last week – two guys in their 40s who’ve spent 15 years making skating games based around their experiences in their late teens. Making the first couple of OlliOlli games in 2014 and 2015 inspired them to get back into skating in real life, which is absolutely lovely. I, meanwhile, love skateboarding in video games but possess absolutely none of the coordination or flair to attempt it ever in real life. I am more than happy to stick to mad ten-thousand-point combos in Tony Hawk’s, where I can experience the thrill of pulling off a laser flip without repeatedly humiliating in myself in front of teenagers at a skate park or breaking any bones. OlliOlli World isn’t out until 8 February, but I’ve been playing it for a week and this seems like the ideal time to recommend it. I was really looking forward to this surreal skateboarding game, and yet I was not expecting it to be as welcoming and fun as it is – the previous two OlliOlli games were quite punishing, if also mega rewarding once you got into the flow. In OlliOlli World you create a little cartoon skater avatar and explore these far-out fantastical levels, flipping the board with the analogue stick to pull off beautifully animated tricks and clear huge gaps. There’s so much delightful visual detail in here – in the background of a beach-themed level I spotted a bunch of buff seagulls hanging out in sunglasses. It’s so cute, and yet also so rad.

This marks an escalation of the acquisitions arms race kicked off by Microsoft in recent years. Josh Wardle, creator of Wordle, has decided to hand it over to the New York Times, having been overwhelmed by its rapid spread. This seems like a good conclusion all round; it’s highly unlikely that the NYT will ruin it. Hello Games, known best for space exploration game No Man’s Sky and the saga around its development and release, has remastered its first ever game, a little stunt-bike puzzler called Joe Danger, and rereleased it on the App Store. This is nice, but what’s lovely about the story is what prompted them to get moving on updating the game: a plea from the dad of an 8-year-old with autism who really loves the game. A beautiful reminder of the significance that games can hold in people’s lives, and of the fact that pretty much any game out there will be hugely important to someone. Remember those Activision-Blizzard employees trying to form a union? The company has refused to recognise it, triggering a studio-wide election that has slim chances of success. I wish I could say I’m surprised. Oh god, British developer Team17 is launching a series of NFTs to commemorate the Worms games. They are called MetaWorms. I truly hope that nobody wants them; gamers have proven extremely resistant to attempts to inveigle NFTs into video games so far (though these digital collectibles won’t actually be used in games, it seems). Incidentally, since I wrote this despairing editorial about the hollowness of the “metaverse” idea last week, I have started receiving more press releases about soul-sapping crypto, blockchain and metaverse “initiatives”. I don’t want it. Please, video games industry, don’t make it my entire job to rage about this nonsense. Sony to buy video game maker Bungie for $3.6bn as takeovers continue Now that I’ve finally played The Last of Us, who wants to talk about that ending? Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection review – victory tour for feelgood blockbusters Something a little different for Question Block today from reader Joe Murray, who wants to know if anyone remembers a particular game from the mists of time: I would absolutely love to see a remaster of the PlayStation 1 game Pandemonium (also the sequel). When I was younger, I borrowed my uncle’s PlayStation 2 off him and found this PS1 game, popped it on and played it all night. I didn’t have a memory card, so to save my progress I had to write down the unique code given at the end of the level … This game was stressful and difficult, but also fun, vibrant and rewarding, with incredible bosses that used to scare the life out of me (see the Shroom Lord) and great dialogue that I still quote today, even if no one ever gets the references. I’d love if you could have a look through the game yourself and see if you can recall it. I’ve not seen it available anywhere and I don’t own any generation of PlayStation any more so I don’t know if I’ll ever play it again; I imagine the graphics do not hold up at all either, but it was a huge part of my childhood.” This is a game I never played, but I’ve just spent twenty minutes fascinated by clips of it on YouTube. Good news, Joe – you can play it on Steam, though apparently the port is terrible. And Toys for Bob, the original developer, is owned by Activision, which is now owned by Microsoft, which has brought back obscure games like BattleToads – so is it totally out of the question that it might be rereleased?

2/1/2022,"Spike Milligan spent the 1940s fighting the war – and the 50s fighting the BBC. That’s the argument ventured by Ian Hislop and Nick Newman in their play about the tormented comedian, who channelled his combat experiences into that “shellshock on radio” sensation, The Goon Show. Spike focuses on the early years of Milligan’s still-fragile success. Audiences love the show, it makes his co-stars Harry Secombe and Peter Sellers famous – but Milligan struggles with overwork, PTSD symptoms and the open disdain of the BBC’s top brass. It’s a sympathetic portrait, then, of the Anglo-Irishman, the more so for John Dagleish’s likably hangdog turn in the title role. It’s Milligan with a pinch of Harry Corbett thrown in: shabby, chippy and unable to stop cracking wise, even when there’s a noose around his neck. Director Paul Hart summons the spirit of the Goons with a fast-paced, capering production, one short scene after another hurling us from the Grafton Arms back to the battlefields of Monte Cassino and forward to the recording studios of the BBC.  The dash distracts you from the lack of depth. The play paints Milligan’s fraught psychology in broad brushstrokes. His encounters with broadcasting’s stuffed shirts, as represented by blithering Robert Mountford, are enjoyable but cartoonish. Vivid as they are, George Kemp’s smooth Sellers and Jeremy Lloyd’s hearty Secombe are only ever supporting – and supportive – roles. And there’s no real dramatic shape to the tale Spike tells. The BBC’s snobbishness and Milligan’s fatigue are constants. Milligan’s eventual triumph, as the Goons’ audience figures become irresistible, is told not shown: the battle of wills between corporation and comic lacks a climax. But as an overview of a revolutionary moment in comedy history, it’s nimbly done, with a fun role carved out for Margaret Cabourn-Smith’s Foley artist Janet (and a thankless one for Ellie Morris as Spike’s beleaguered wife). The impression is potent of a talent who needed pricks to kick against, and in doing so – notably here with a Goons Orwell parody mocking “the Big Brother Corporation” – loosed British entertainment from the chains of deference. For that, he deserves thanks – and this buoyant tribute.

2/1/2022,"Handel considered Theodora the greatest of his oratorios. Few today would disagree with him, though it was surprisingly unsuccessful at its Covent Garden premiere in 1750, and the Royal Opera’s new production effectively marks its overdue homecoming. Notoriety, however, began to cling to Katie Mitchell’s staging well before opening night, thanks to trigger warnings about “explicit violence” on the Royal Opera website, and the much reported employment of intimacy coordinator Ita O’Brien to ensure the performers felt comfortable with the sex scenes. All this has to some extent been a bit of a distraction, as the production is for the most part a reined-in affair, and neither particularly explicit (either sexually or in its depiction of violence) nor quite as inflammatory as anticipated.  Mitchell’s stance is typically probing and interrogative. Distrusting Handel’s supposed depiction of his heroine as stoic or passive (with which not everyone would agree) Mitchell makes her a fundamentalist revolutionary rather than a martyr and relocates the oratorio to a modern-day alternative reality, setting it in an embassy that has been infiltrated by Christian resistance members bent on destroying the male-dominated pagan Roman system. The interlocking rooms of Chloe Lamford’s set take us into the kitchen, where we find Julia Bullock’s Theodora and Joyce DiDonato’s Irene making bombs, then to a grand salon in which Gyula Orendt’s psychopathic Valens issues orders and holds official functions, and also into what turns out to be a state-run brothel, where Theodora is forced into prostitution. Mitchell makes more than most directors of the gender implications of the scenes in which Didymus (Jakub Józef Orliński) and Theodora exchange clothes, and presents Septimius (Ed Lyon) as a more duplicitous figure than the compassionate Enlightenment rationalist of Handel’s imagination. There’s a twist at the end that takes us far from the original narrative. The overriding problem, I think, is that fundamentalists are ultimately sympathetic only to other fundamentalists, and it was not always easy to feel involved. One of the finest casts ever assembled for the work, however, means that musically this is breathtaking. Quietly passionate, Bullock sounds lovely in her arias and her voice blends beautifully with Orliński’s in their duets. He sings ravishingly throughout, as does DiDonato: As With Rosy Steps the Morn is a thing of rapt, introverted pianissimos, exquisitely done. Lyon is forthright, handsome in tone and presence, while Orendt is all hauteur and malign intensity. There’s immaculate choral singing, superbly focused and balanced, along with fervour, grace and elegance in Harry Bicket’s conducting. You may be in two minds about Mitchell’s staging, but it’s one of the most beautiful things you will ever hear.

2/1/2022,"Some of the White House records turned over to the House committee investigating the January 6 attack were ripped up by Donald Trump.  The documents include diaries, schedules, handwritten notes, speeches and remarks. The supreme court rejected Trump’s attempt to stop the National Archives turning them over to Congress. In a statement, the Archives said: “Some of the Trump presidential records received by the National Archives and Records Administration included paper records that had been torn up by former president Trump. “These were turned over to the National Archives at the end of the Trump administration, along with a number of torn-up records that had not been reconstructed by the White House. The Presidential Records Act requires that all records created by presidents be turned over to the National Archives at the end of their administrations.” The Archives did not say how it knew Trump had torn the records but his habit of tearing up documents has been widely reported. In 2018, Politico spoke to Solomon Lartey, a records management analyst who spent time “armed with rolls of clear Scotch tape … sft[ing] through large piles of paper and put[ting] them back together … ‘like a jigsaw puzzle’.” Lartey and another staffer who taped records were fired by the White House that year, they said summarily. Lartey said: “They told [Trump] to stop doing it. He didn’t want to stop.” After a process that reached the supreme court, the Archives gave more than 700 documents concerning the Capitol attack to the House committee last month. More than 700 people have been charged over the riot, in which Trump supporters tried to stop certification of his election defeat. Eleven members of a far-right militia are charged with seditious conspiracy. More than 100 police officers were injured. Seven people died. The committee has recommended criminal charges for two Trump associates, former White House strategist Steve Bannon and chief of staff Mark Meadows. Bannon refused co-operation and pleaded not guilty to contempt of Congress. Meadows co-operated, then withdrew. He has not been charged. Speaking to the Washington Post, Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor, said destroying White House documents “could be a crime under several statutes that make it a crime to destroy government property if that was the intent of the defendant. “A president does not own the records generated by his own administration. The definition of presidential records is broad. Trump’s own notes to himself could qualify and destroying them could be the criminal destruction of government property.” Trump did not comment. Nor did the House committee. It was also reported on Tuesday that text messages were turned over to the committee by Kayleigh McEnany, Trump’s last press secretary. ABC News reported that McEnany appeared before investigators on 13 January. It also said the texts were the source for conversations with the Fox News host Sean Hannity which were quoted by the committee in a request for information from Ivanka Trump, the former president’s daughter and adviser. “1 – no more stolen election talk,” Hannity texted McEnany after the Capitol attack. Referring to possible attempts to remove Trump from power, he added: “2- Yes, impeachment and the 25th amendment are real and many people will quit.” McEnany replied: “Love that. Thank you. That is the playbook. I will help reinforce.” Trump was impeached but acquitted. The 25th amendment, which provides for the removal of a president incapable of fulfilling his or her duties, was not invoked. Trump continues to claim the election was stolen. McEnany is now a Fox News host. She and her employer did not comment.",News/US news,Trump tore up records turned over to House Capitol attack committee,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/01/trump-tore-up-records-turned-over-house-capitol-attack-committee
2/1/2022,"In all of the debate over “partygate” and Sue Gray’s investigation, very little has been said about how civil servants feel about the events that took place in No 10. Yet the consequences for the civil service, from plummeting public trust to Boris Johnson’s plans to restructure Downing Street, could be serious and long-lasting. After all, the prime minister’s term will come to an end at some point, but government will live on. In my time as head of the home civil service and during a long career of working with civil servants I found that the overwhelming majority believe in doing the right things in the right way. The institution’s core values – integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality – are imbued in every new recruit and are genuinely lived. This, of course, does not make the civil service perfect. It has been criticised, sometimes rightly, for paying too much attention to process, rather than outcome, and not responding quickly or decisively enough in an emergency. But doing things properly really matters.  The police investigation means that we only have an update from Sue Gray, not the full report we were anticipating. However, even with this limited scope, the picture at the heart of government is damning. For civil servants who set such a high store on good behaviour and doing the right thing, this is anathema. It damages their self-esteem – it wasn’t that long ago that we claimed to have the best civil service in the world – and, equally important, it damages the perception of the public. Trust is a precious commodity that takes a long time to build and is quickly lost. There is no doubt that partygate has significantly reinforced the declining trust between the governing and the governed. The job of being a civil servant has been made a lot harder. For civil servants working in Whitehall, this also applies to their relationship with ministers. To be effective, civil servants need to believe in ministers’ basic integrity. Their job is to help them deliver their policies regardless of their personal views. But what if that basic respect between minister and civil servant is undermined? Or, when push comes to shove, they are left to carry the can rather than ministers taking responsibility? Or, when ministers are found to have departed from the ministerial code, as was clearly the case for Priti Patel, no action will be taken? The most likely conclusion they will reach is that there are better opportunities outside government, which will deprive the government and country of much-needed talent. Gray’s update also points to the need for structural reforms to No 10. There is undoubtedly a good case for change. When Downing Street has worked well, it has often been in spite of rather than because of the way things are organised. The prime minister, in his response to the House of Commons, talked of creating an Office of the Prime Minister with a permanent secretary at No 10, and also of looking again at the code of conduct for the civil service and special advisers. Constitutionalists and former senior civil servants are likely to pile in with opinions on these proposals. It will add further uncertainty at a time when relations in N0 10 are already strained. Whatever the merits of changing structures and codes, however, I fear that they distract from the fundamental issues of leadership behaviour and culture. In government, even more so than in other organisations I have worked in, this culture is ultimately set at the top – in this case by the prime minister – and not by the principal private secretary or a special adviser. It may be that the Metropolitan police report and the full Sue Gray findings will shine a brighter light on who should properly take responsibility. Meanwhile, the public’s view as shown in numerous opinion polls is that the rules have been broken and those responsible will not be punished. This is bad news for believers in good government and for civil servants. It is important to remember, too, that most civil servants are based outside Westminster. They deliver public services such as paying benefits, running prisons, helping people into jobs and collecting taxes. Their response to partygate will be much the same as the general public – anger and disbelief when they themselves have made such huge sacrifices. There has been an effort by some politicians to dismiss the Downing Street parties as an irrelevance – that we are wasting our time talking about prosecco parties when we should be responding to Putin. But there are few things more important to our democracy than believing those are the top will follow the rules and tell the truth. Civil servants have particularly good reasons for understanding this fundamental truth.
