1/19/2022,"In 2014, Microsoft bought Minecraft’s developer Mojang for what seemed, at the time, an eye-popping figure: $2.5bn (£1.8bn). It was the first in a series of bullish video-game studio acquisitions by the tech giant, whose games division has been led by executive Phil Spencer, a long-time advocate for video games within Microsoft and the wider business world, for the past eight years. More studios followed, for undisclosed amounts: beloved Californian comedy-game artists Double Fine, UK studio Ninja Theory, RPG specialists Obsidian Entertainment. It seemed that under Spencer’s leadership, Microsoft was cementing its commitment to the Xbox console and the video-games business by investing in what makes games great: the people who make them. Then came 2020’s deal to acquire Zenimax (and with it Bethesda), for a properly astonishing $7.5bn. This was different. This wasn’t the Xbox division acquiring studios to make games for its consoles. This was an entire publisher, with several different studios and a whole portfolio of popular game series. At this point Microsoft’s spending started to look like a monopoly move – a bid to sew up the market by closing off hugely popular games behind Microsoft’s own consoles and services. When it was confirmed that Bethesda’s forthcoming games, including this year’s space role-playing epic Starfield and the next fantasy Elder Scrolls game, would be exclusive to Xbox and Microsoft Game Pass, I started to wonder whether Microsoft’s stated aim to make video games more widely available to everyone was lining up with its actions in the market.  But Zenimax is nothing compared with this week’s news that Microsoft is buying Activision Blizzard, for nearly $70bn. This latest acquisition – the biggest in video-game history by some margin, more than 17 times what Disney paid for Marvel – shows beyond doubt that Microsoft is extremely committed to dominating the video-game market, now and in the future. Its main competitor Sony has an exceptional stable of talented developers making games for its PlayStation 5 console – the latest of which, Insomniac Games, was bought in 2019 for “just” $299m. Though Microsoft hasn’t released exact sales numbers for its more recent Xbox consoles, it is widely thought that the PlayStation has outsold them by a significant margin. But without Call of Duty, just one of many giant games properties that Microsoft now owns, PlayStation is left even more reliant on its own studios to create games that people want to play. If all of Activision Blizzard’s games soon become Xbox and PC exclusive, as Bethesda’s now are, it will transform the console market, creating even more of a monopolistic environment. Right now, with Nintendo, there are only three big players in games consoles. Do we really want that to become two, or one? What would that mean for games, and the people who make and play them? It’s possible that studios will be largely left alone to create what they want, and that the creative diversity of games won’t be affected too badly. But one company then creams off a large percentage of all the profits. This is enough by itself to cause a huge stir in gaming, but it’s also only a narrow slice of what this deal means. When it goes through, Microsoft will also own King, creators of Candy Crush and several more of the most popular mobile games in the world. It will own World of Warcraft, one of the oldest and most beloved virtual worlds. It puts one company in charge of an enormous slice of people’s leisure time and money, the world over. Going by Phil Spencer’s past comments, Sony and PlayStation aren’t the only competition Microsoft is thinking about – it’s all games, all the virtual places where people spend their time and money, from Fortnite to Roblox. This is why the word “metaverse” is being thrown around by executives. It’s about more than Xbox v PlayStation. What Microsoft wants is to be where everyone goes to play games, of all kinds. Through its Game Pass service it has laid the foundations for it to become the Netflix of gaming, the hub for all content. But where Netflix has moneyed competitors in Disney, Apple and Amazon, no other company in gaming can compete with Microsoft. Even Nintendo, the longest running and best-resourced company in gaming, does not have $70bn to throw around. (Its entire war chest amounts to $9bn.) What’s happening here is akin to what happens when oil billionaires rock up to the Premier League, buy a team, and pack it with the best players. It is not a level playing field. Tech companies have, historically, never been able to buy their way to success in the video-game industry. Amazon has failed. Google has failed. Apple has only ever dipped a pinky into the waters. Microsoft itself has made several huge mistakes on this front in the past, buying up developers such as Lionhead only to shutter them later. The fact is that games are not tech products; they are not phones, which get incrementally better each year, or software, or services. They are entertainment; they are art. Technology is what enables games, what creates them, but it is not what they are. Microsoft sees games as content. It seems not so much interested in creating games – or selling consoles – as owning where and how we play them.",Arts/Games,Monopoly money: is Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard good for gaming?,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/19/monopoly-money-is-microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-good-for-gaming
1/19/2022,"Peter Robinson, the former Liverpool club secretary who played an instrumental role in the club’s rise under Bill Shankly and beyond, has died aged 86. ‘PBR’, as he was affectionately known at Anfield, was regarded as one of the finest administrators in the game over a 35-year career at Liverpool. His decision-making, innovations, transfer dealings and relationships with several managers helped transform the club into a dominant force in England and Europe.  Robinson joined Liverpool in 1965 after jobs at Stockport County, Crewe, Brighton and Scunthorpe. By the time he retired in 2000, having taken on the chief executive role in 1992, the club had amassed 29 major trophies on his watch, including four European Cups and 12 league championships. Alongside the chairman John Smith, Robinson modernised Liverpool internally and oversaw the redevelopment of Anfield and the construction of a new academy at Kirkby, which has since extended to become the first team’s training ground. More importantly, his highly successful working relationship with Shankly helped elevate Liverpool to a glittering era sustained under Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish. Robinson was involved in all of their appointments and behind many of the most important transfers in Liverpool’s history, and his tenure also covered the managerial careers of Graeme Souness, Roy Evans and Gérard Houllier. Houllier was considering offers from Celtic and Sheffield Wednesday when Robinson called on the pretext of congratulating him on the new role, and invited him to Liverpool instead. Several former Liverpool players paid tribute to Robinson on Wednesday. Jamie Carragher tweeted: “One of the most important figures in LFC success over many years. RIP PBR.” Dietmar Hamann, who played for the club from 1999-2006, tweeted: “Sad news indeed, a special man left us. LFC wouldn’t be where they are now if it wasn’t for him. He’ll be badly missed.” Jan Molby wrote: “LFC won 29 major trophies whilst Peter was pulling the strings upstairs. RIP Peter Robinson YNWA.” Liverpool said in a statement: “We are deeply saddened by the passing of former club secretary and chief executive Peter Robinson. The thoughts of everyone at Liverpool FC are with his family and friends at this difficult time.”",Sport/Football,"Peter Robinson, Liverpool’s influential former club secretary, dies aged 86",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/19/peter-robinson-liverpool-former-club-secretary-dies-aged-86
1/19/2022,"A second man has been arrested in connection with the killing of the schoolteacher Ashling Murphy while she was out jogging in rural Ireland. The man is reportedly known to the 31-year-old man who was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of Murphy’s murder. The second male was detained in relation to potential withholding of information contrary to the Offences Against the State Act and can be held for up to three days.  The first man, a father of young children with links to County Offaly, where Murphy was from, is still being held by Tullamore garda, who are leading the investigation into Murphy’s killing. He spent five days in a Dublin hospital after presenting himself with injuries that raised suspicion and was arrested on discharge while Murphy’s funeral was taking place. He can be held for up to 24 hours, excluding breaks including sleep, before being charged or released. Murphy was killed last Wednesday in what was described by the bishop of Meath at her funeral as a “depraved act of violence”. The scene along a canal path is still sealed off by gardai who are searching for forensic evidence and a possible weapon. They have searched nearby bottle and clothing banks and two houses of interest for potential evidence. They are also examining a Falcon Storm mountain bike that appeared to have been abandoned near the attack, and have seized two cars. The 31-year-old arrested on suspicion of murder was questioned for up to 11 hours on Tuesday, and interviews resumed on Wednesday morning. Under the rules, he must be charged or released by about 9pm on Wednesday.",News/World news,Irish police arrest second man in Ashling Murphy case,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/19/second-man-arrested-by-irish-police-in-connection-with-death-of-ashling-murphy
1/19/2022,"Mary can no longer see: her eyes are covered by a blindfold, blood is dripping from her sockets on to her cheeks. With this chilling image the movie begins; but only at the end do we learn how Mary has been blinded – and what she saw. Though by this point, there are cracks in the icy mood of this austere, slow-paced horror. It is set in 1840s rural New York where the story unfolds in flashback, claustrophobically confined to a single house. Young Mary (Stefanie Scott) has been caught in flagrante with the family’s maid Eleanor (Isabelle Fuhrman) and her God-fearing parents inflict “correctional” punishment on the girls: forcing them to kneel painfully on rice for hours. This all feels a bit familiar: fire-and-brimstone preaching; evil done in the name of our Lord; puritanical starched collars and severe hair partings. But first-time director Edoardo Vitaletti really stokes up the menace. Cinematographer David Kruta lights faces by candle; there are images here with the richness of portraits, characters’ eyes glistening with malignant fervour.  The family plan is to separate Mary and Eleanor, sending the maid away. But the girls are defiant. Mary plots revenge, lips twisted into a malicious smile. But this relationship at the heart of the movie fails to convince. These two girls are supposed to be fired up on me-and-you-against-the-world teenage love, but the chemistry is a bit underwhelming. And I must say, my tolerance for seeing women and girls abused on screen is at an all-time low. Stealing the film is Judith Roberts as Mary’s grandmother, named in the credits as the Matriarch, and possibly the source of actual ungodly acts. A terrific horror-movie villain, she is an evil Miss Havisham, with a coquettish smile and beady evil eyes. The trouble with the film is that beneath the surface lurks … well, perhaps not quite enough to keep the momentum going.  The Last Thing Mary Saw is available on 20 January on Shudder.",Arts/Film,The Last Thing Mary Saw review – fire-and-brimstone horror strikes a spark,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/19/the-last-thing-mary-saw-review-fire-and-brimstone-horror-loses-its-spark
1/19/2022,"Omar* worked for a UK-funded cultural programme, working on human rights and cultural projects. He lost his work when the Taliban arrived, and has applied to move to Britain. He has five daughters and is particularly concerned about their welfare. Afghanistan: the left behind The crowds fighting to get into Kabul airport for evacuation dispersed months ago, but while the scramble to leave Taliban-controlled Afghanistan became less visible when the last foreign troops left in August 2021, it got no less desperate. Since then, reprisal killings have regularly been reported from across the country, including dozens detailed in a recent report from Human Rights Watch.  For those still in Afghanistan, living in hiding or in permanent fear for months now, the dangers seem to be increasing as the options for escape narrow. The UK government has tightened rules for its ARAP visa programme for former employees. A second scheme offering a path to safety to a wider section of Afghans at risk was heavily promoted by the government but it only began operating this month, and there are no details of how individuals can apply. And while the Taliban have largely kept a promise to allow those with tickets and documents to fly out, Afghan passports are difficult to secure , visas are even more challenging, and flights are still prohibitively expensive. This series features the stories of those who are trapped, in Afghanistan or in limbo as they search for safe haven, fearing for their lives from Taliban attacks or through hunger because they cannot work. Emma Graham-Harrison  After the capture of Kabul by the Taliban, our lives changed completely because of my work for a British organisation. Although the Taliban said in a statement that they had declared an amnesty for government workers, they have not kept that promise. They are seeking revenge against those who worked with foreign institutions. I’ve heard reports of people being arrested at night and taken to unknown places. Two months ago, I heard that the Taliban were looking for me and they came asking for me at my previous house. After that, l hid. Whenever I feel [there is] a new threat, if I get an unexplained phone call, or a warning, we’re forced to move from one place to another. Sometimes we rent somewhere new, sometimes I move to the house of close relatives. In the past three months we’ve moved many times. My main concern is for my family and my daughters. We live like prisoners. My daughters need fresh air and sunshine, especially my youngest daughter, who’s eight; she cries a lot and wants to go out. She has bad nightmares and no longer sleeps properly. During the day, she is asking me and her mother the same questions over and again: “Why can’t we go out? Why do we have to keep moving?” It is very difficult to answer these questions. Women’s rights have been completely violated. My eldest daughter was studying to become a dentist, but she is no longer going to university and is stuck at home. She’s very depressed, feeling hopeless about her future. She says the Taliban have killed all her dreams. Two years ago, a member of the Taliban proposed to her, but she refused. I’m worried that refusal will have repercussions for her now; I fear they want to force her to get married. All my daughters are trying to keep up their studies at home, trying to learn English better through online programmes, but everyone feels depressed and tired of life. When you go out in Kabul you can see how our ordinary way of life has completely changed. A few moments ago, I went out to get bread and met people who were telling each other that today a young girl was beaten in the market for revealing her legs. People’s economic situation has completely disintegrated. People are out on the street selling their property and household items to make money to buy food. You see fear in the people’s eyes. We are managing with food because the UK-funded project I was working with sent money to cover our salary for six months. We’re still using the small amount of money left over for daily necessities, but other families are worried about their children suffering from malnutrition. Even though I think my life is in danger, I don’t worry so much about myself. For better or worse, I’ve lived a good part of my life. But as a father, I think more about the future of my family. It is very painful for me that my daughters are still very young and having to go through this. I can’t imagine what else they will have to endure. Even talking about it makes my voice catch in my throat. We are alive and yet we do not really live. *The name has been changed for this article.",News/World news,‘The Taliban are seeking revenge’: ex-cultural worker on a UK project,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/the-taliban-are-seeking-revenge-ex-cultural-worker-on-a-uk-project
1/19/2022,"From state surveillance of communists, to all women finally winning the vote, and a peek inside the No 43 Soho nightclub, a new exhibition on the roaring 20s aims to highlight a decade not just of postwar decadence but of huge discontent and social upheaval. Anchored on the recent release of the 1921 census, the free exhibition The 1920s: Beyond the Roar, which opens at the National Archives in Kew this week, covers international peace treaties, textile samples and lonely hearts adverts, alongside a reconstruction of the No 43, run by the “Nightclub Queen”, Kate Meyrick.  Visitors are led through a series of encounters, past a newsstand, a polling station, into a 1920s living room and finally to the No 43, with the story of the decade told through documents, posters, film footage, and audio of Meyrick, who was five times imprisoned for breaking strict licensing laws. Among highlights is an MI5 blacklist entry on Shapurji Saklatvala, one of the first MPs of Indian heritage and one of the first communists to enter the House of Commons. “He is a really interesting character because he is very vocal during his time as an MP. He made a speech during the General Strike, and got arrested for the speech he made,” said the exhibition’s co-curator Katie Fox. “He was interested in Irish independence, in decolonisation, and lots of the issues that are really prominent within the decade. He was a communist, and like a lot of communists at the time he was watched very carefully by the state, and the file we have on display is a security service file on him.” The 1920s saw huge political change, with four general elections held. “Whilst we think of the decade as the roaring 20s, actually it was a decade of discontent, high unemployment and protest. There were lots of people agitating for change,” said Fox. Posters, placards and film footage tell the story of strikes and protests. All women finally got the vote on the same terms as men. The polling station exhibit displays a copy of the 1928 act, next to an elector registration form for the so-called “flapper elections” of 1929. A copy of the postwar 1925 Locarno Pact is displayed next to a lonely hearts publication, where men and women had to describe themselves and who they were looking for in 75 words. It was also a decade where the authorities tried to impose strict morality. A poster for the 1923 film Maisie’s Marriage tells the story of how censors forced producers to rename it because they feared the original title, Married Love, based on the book by Dr Marie Stopes, was propaganda for birth control. “The book came out in 1918, and it was very popular and discussed birth control openly, which was a taboo subject at the time. It also touched on female pleasure,” said the co-curator Dr Laura Robson-Mainwaring. Capturing the style and atmosphere of the No 43 nightclub, which was based in Soho, is another highlight. Nightclubs were a new social spaces where men and women could mix. There was new music and new fashions. “The reason we are able to explore this at the National Archives is because within the collection we have police raid records, particularly relating to a number of clubs owned by Kate Meyrick, the ‘Nightclub Queen’ at the time,” said Hannah Fleming, an interpretation manager. “Kate was sentenced to five terms of imprisonment for breaking licensing laws. And we have pages and pages and pages of police records including the very first raid.” During that raid, police questioned Meyrick, asking: “Do you have a licence for selling intoxicating liquor.” “She smiled and said: ‘I’m not selling, I’m giving it away’. But that didn’t wash and she was repeatedly raided,” said Fleming. The 1920s: Beyond the Roar runs from 21 January 2022 to 11 June 2022 at the National Archives, Kew, Richmond, London.
