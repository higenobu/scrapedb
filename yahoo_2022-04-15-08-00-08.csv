4/15/2022,"Bill Maher continues to insist that his politics haven’t changed — but the landscape is shifting beneath his feet so fast that the prolific GOP-bashing host of HBO’s “Real Time” suggested on Joe Rogan’s podcast this week that even he may have a tipping point to cross over to the Republican Party. Maher, the staunch liberal who ushered politics into late night with “Politically Incorrect” and now “Real Time” on HBO, has had taken many sojourns into centrist and center-right thinking of late. He and Rogan likened their mutual centrism to a rare form of “common sense” on the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast that debuted Tuesday. Maher suggested that runaway government spending — and the grift that comes along with it — just might be the thing that changes his stripes. Rogan and Maher began by riffing on the enormous spending packages the federal government has floated of late, including the Democrats’ doomed “Build Back Better” package and the Trump-era COVID-19 stimulus packages, and how much of that money winds up in the hands of fraudsters and grifters. “People would say to me, ‘Oh, you’re complaining [like a Republican] about the government spending money,” Maher said. “OK, but is there any number at which I am not tipped over to the Republican side? That I can’t complain about money that’s just being stolen?” Like everyone, Maher apparently has a price. (Watch the video clip below). Maher went on to make the connection to California’s now-defunct Pacific Coast railroad line, which absorbed hundreds of millions of federal and state dollars only to break down and fade to oblivion. “As a good liberal, I totally accept the notion that ‘You cannot transfer money without a leaky bucket,'” Maher continued. “I get it. It can’t be perfect. But is there no number for which I cannot remonstrate against this?” “California tried to build a railroad,” Maher said. “Makes sense, cars, good for the environment, blah blah blah. When they finally pulled the plug, it was $200 million a mile. Now France, not unknown to have unions and workers’ rights, did it for like, one-seventh [of the cost].” Maher also acknowledged that had Build Back Better passed, it, too, would have been ripe for the picking. “When I hear about ‘Build Back Better,’ certainly the country needs to be rebuilt,” Maher said. “The infrastructure is a mess. But I’m always thinking like, when you give me a number [in this case, $1.5 trillion], it seems like you pulled it out of your ass. And it came in right at that round number, huh? … what if we only spend $1.2 trillion? What would we be saving? Because so much money is going to consultants — all the pigs at the trough.” Maher said that kind of thinking is not a Republican idea, it’s more like … “Common sense?” Rogan replied. “Common sense!” exclaimed Maher. “Yes!”",U.S./The Wrap,Bill Maher Reveals the One Thing That Might ‘Tip Me Over to the Republican Side’,https://news.yahoo.com/bill-maher-reveals-one-thing-152450182.html
4/15/2022,"(Reuters) -Russian officials on Thursday said Ukrainian helicopters had hit residential buildings and injured seven people in the Bryansk region, the latest of a series of cross-border attacks that Moscow has said may trigger a retaliatory attack on Kyiv. The governor of the Belgorod region said villages there were also attacked and one person had been injured. Ukraine's defence ministry, which has declined to comment on several border incidents including a strike on a fuel depot in the city of Belgorod earlier this month, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. The Ukrainian government's Center for Countering Disinformation accused Russia's intelligence services of implementing ""a plan to carry out terrorist acts to whip up anti-Ukrainian hysteria"" in Russia, according to a statement. It mentioned two purported attacks in the western Russian city of Bryansk but nothing about an air strike. ""On April 14, 2022, using two combat helicopters equipped with heavy offensive weapons, military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine illegally entered the airspace of the Russian Federation,"" Russia's investigative committee said in a statement. ""Moving at low altitude, they carried out at least six air strikes on residential buildings in the village of Klimovo,"" it said. Six buildings were damaged and seven people were injured, the statement said. A health ministry official said two people had been seriously injured, RIA news agency reported. Bryansk regional authorities closed schools for fear of further strikes, TASS news agency reported. Vehicles were damaged when a border post came under mortar fire from Ukraine near Klimovo on Wednesday, Russia's FSB security service told state television. Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday the continuation of ""sabotage and attacks"" by Ukrainian forces could prompt attacks on the capital Kyiv. ""If such incidents continue, then consequence from the armed forces of the Russian Federation will be attacks on decision making centres, including in Kyiv, which the Russian army has refrained from to date,"" the defence ministry said. Authorities in four Russian regions bordering Ukraine and in Russian-controlled Crimea announced they were increasing security measures on Monday over what they said were ""possible provocations"" from Ukraine. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, has seen more than 4.6 million people flee abroad, killed or wounded thousands and left Russia increasingly isolated on the world stage. The Kremlin says it launched a ""special military operation"" in late February to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext for an unprovoked attack.
