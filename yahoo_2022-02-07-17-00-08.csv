2/7/2022,"By Karen Lema MANILA (Reuters) -As frontrunner in the Philippines' presidential race, the son of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos appears poised to complete a remarkable rebranding of the family name 36 years after a ""people power"" uprising ended his father's autocratic rule. With official campaigning beginning on Tuesday, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., 64, holds a double-digit lead in the polls, three months ahead of the May 9 elections. His push for the presidency has been aided by what political analysts say has been a decades-long public relations effort to alter public perception of his family and supporters. Critics accuse the Marcoses of attempting to rewrite history. ""What we are witnessing right now is nothing short of a counter-revolution,"" said Richard Heydarian, an author and academic who specialises in politics. ""The Marcoses are here to erase the 1986 (people power) revolution, and to restore the glory and fully rehabilitate the image of the Marcos regime."" Since the family's return from exile in the 1990s, Marcos has served as governor and congressman of the northern Ilocos Norte province, his father's bailiwick, before winning a seat in the Senate in 2010. His sister is a senator and a former governor and former congresswoman, and his mother, Imelda, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1992, was elected to Congress for four terms. The return of a Marcos to Malacanang, the presidential palace, is unthinkable for millions of Filipinos, but over half the country's more than 60 million voters are 40 or under, and did not live through the Marcos regime and its oppression and plunder. Ferdinand Marcos Sr., with Imelda by his side, was president for nearly two decades, ruling as a dictator before he was ousted in the ""people power"" uprising in 1986 that has become renowned around the world. Marcos Sr. and Imelda, known for her vast collection of artwork, jewellery and shoes, were accused of amassing more than $10 billion while he was in office. During his rule, 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured, and 3,240 were killed, according to Amnesty International. More than 11,100 victims of human rights abuses during the Marcos regime were paid compensation using millions from Marcos Swiss bank accounts, part of the family's ill-gotten wealth recovered by the government. Among them was Loretta Ann Rosales, a political activist who was tortured and sexually abused during the Marcos regime and is now one of several complainants seeking to bar Marcos Jr. from the presidential race. ""We thought we had gotten rid of the Marcoses,"" said Rosales, who is also a former chairperson of the human rights commission. ""I want him disqualified."" 'LACK LEADERSHIP' Marcos Jr. has questioned the Amnesty data and rejected long-standing narratives of oppression and failed government in his father's rule. He and his family have shunned questions about past atrocities and instead touted what their supporters claim as a 'golden age'. The younger Marcos, also known as Bongbong, did not comment for this story. He has in the past spoken highly of his father, calling him his ""idol"", while expressing admiration for his ""style of work"", his qualities as a strong leader, and his ""love for the Filipino"" people, traits he said he has inherited. ""He had a very clear understanding of what needed to be done and how to do it, and that I think was his best quality as a leader,"" Bongbong Marcos said in a YouTube interview last year. ""The problem we have now is we lack leadership."" The YouTube interview titled 'The Greatest Lesson Bongbong Marcos Learned From His Father' has been viewed 13 million times since it aired in September. ""He is doing very well because we have this pandemic of disinformation,"" said Victor Manhit, an analyst with the Stratbase think tank. ""He has been dominating political discourse in social media."" Fact-checking organisation Vera Files said in a December report that Marcos was the ""top beneficiary"" of disinformation online to spruce up his image while discrediting rivals ahead of the start of the official campaign period. ""Because you are surrounded on social media by the same account saying the same things about Marcos (Sr.) being a good leader - benevolent, revolutionary, all those narratives - even if it sounds bananas and not grounded on facts, you are more likely to believe it is true,"" said Marie Fatima Gaw, communications research professor at the University of the Philippines. Marcos has said he does not engage in negative campaigning. He lost the 2016 vice presidential race to human rights lawyer Leni Robredo, who is also contesting the presidency, along with boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao, Manila Mayor Francisco Domagoso, and senator Panfilo Lacson, among others. For Raphie Respicio, 48, a tricycle driver and tour guide in the Marcos family bastion in Ilocos Norte, no amount of criticism against Marcos will weaken his support for the former senator. ""He has done plenty of things here ... and he helped tricycle drivers earn a living through tourism,"" Respicio said. ""We are 100% for Bongbong.""

2/7/2022,"By Neil Jerome Morales (Reuters) - Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the late dictator whose rule defined the Philippines' recent history, is leading opinion polls on the race to become president, three months ahead of a May 9 election. Below are some facts about the controversial frontrunner and his famous family. WHO IS FERDINAND MARCOS JR.? Marcos, known as ""Bongbong"", is the namesake and only son of the late strongman who ruled for almost two decades until overthrown in 1986 by a peaceful popular revolt. The family fled into exile in Hawaii, where the elder Marcos died. Since their 1990s return, the younger Marcos has been elected governor and congressman of Ilocos Norte, his father's bailiwick, and in 2010, a senator. He narrowly lost a 2016 vice presidential election and the Supreme Court ruled against his challenge. He is married to lawyer Louise Araneta-Marcos and has three sons, one running for congress. WHY IS HE RUNNING? The family has sought to rebuild its image and denies allegations it plundered a vast amount of wealth while in power, estimated in 1987 at $10 billion. Political analysts say at 64, his run could be the family's last chance to return to the Presidential Palace. Mother Imelda, a formidable force behind the Marcos political machinery, is 92. Marcos when filing his candidacy said he would be a unifying leader, but history could make that difficult. His critics argue his family has neither apologised for, nor properly addressed events of the past. He recently said he would not discuss it. WHAT ARE HIS CHANCES? He's the clear favourite, with a 20-point lead in a poll published in December. Having as running mate Sara Duterte-Carpio, daughter of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte, will be a boon. Her strong backing in the south - where the Marcos family historically has lacked support - could be a game-changer. Another advantage, political analysts say, is his strong social media presence aimed at young people born after his father's rule. The family also has influence, as one of the Philippines' most famous dynasties. Despite its fall from grace, it has retained far-reaching and powerful connections, and steadfast support in its Ilocos Norte stronghold. Sister Imee is a senator and former governor, and mother Imelda, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1992, was a four-term congresswoman. ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE MARCOS FAMILY ""There are many positive things to talk about from during that time,"" Marcos told Reuters in 2016, when asked about his father's rule. But later governments have documented 75,000 cases of torture, illegal detention and disappearances after martial law was declared, a time when Marcos Jr. was at school in England. His parents' rule has been called a kleptocratic ""conjugal dictatorship"". Thousands of martial law victims received compensation using about $600 million recovered from Swiss bank accounts. A government agency created to recover missing Marcos-era wealth, much via courts, has so far only recovered $3.41 billion in 33 years. Marcos has said his family respects court decisions on the matter. RESISTANCE TO MARCOS Opponents to the Marcos family have vowed to stop him from becoming president by whatever means possible. Some sought to disqualify him because of a tax evasion conviction three decades ago, which complainants said should have meant a lifetime election ban. However, in January, a division of the election commission rejected one such complaint. He faces at least four more over the tax offence, however, and it is unclear when those would be decided on. Losing parties can also appeal to the Supreme Court.

2/7/2022,"Donald Trump’s incendiary call at a Texas rally for his backers to ready massive protests against “radical, vicious, racist prosecutors” could constitute obstruction of justice or other crimes and backfire legally on Trump, say former federal prosecutors. Trump’s barbed attack was seen as carping against separate federal and state investigations into his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his real estate empire. Trump’s rant that his followers should launch the “biggest protests” ever in three cities should prosecutors “do anything wrong or illegal” by criminally charging him for his efforts to overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 victory, or for business tax fraud, came at a 30 January rally in Texas where he repeated falsehoods that the election was rigged. Legal experts were astonished at Trump’s strong hints that if he runs and wins a second term in 2024, he would pardon many of those charged for attacking the Capitol on 6 January last year in hopes of thwarting Biden’s certification by Congress. Related: ‘The walls are closing in’: Trump reels from week of political setbacks Former Richard Nixon White House counsel John Dean attacked Trump’s talk of pardons for the rioters as the “stuff of dictators” and stressed that “failure to confront a tyrant only encourages bad behavior”. Taken together, veteran prosecutors say Trump’s comments seemed to reveal that the former president now feels more legal jeopardy from the three inquiries in Atlanta, Washington and New York, all of which have accelerated since the start of 2022. Trump’s anxiety was especially palpable when he urged supporters at the Texas rally to stage “the biggest protests we have ever had in Washington DC, in New York, in Atlanta and elsewhere,” should any charges be brought, a plea for help that could boomerang and create more legal problems for the former president. Dennis Aftergut, a former federal prosecutor who is of counsel to Lawyers Defending American Democracy, told the Guardian Trump “may have shot himself in the foot” with the comments. “Criminal intent can be hard to prove, but when a potential defendant says something easily seen as intimidating or threatening to those investigating the case it becomes easier,” Aftergut said. Aftergut added that having proclaimed “his support for the insurrectionists, Trump added evidence of his corrupt intent on January 6 should the DOJ prosecute him for aiding the seditious conspiracy, or for impeding an official proceeding of Congress”. Likewise, a former US attorney in Georgia, Michael Moore, said Trump’s comments could “potentially intimidate witnesses and members of a grand jury”, noting that it is a felony in Georgia to deter a witness from testifying before a grand jury. Trump “is essentially calling for vigilante justice against the justice system. He’s not interested in the pursuit of justice but blocking any investigations”, Moore added. Trump’s angry outburst came as three investigations by prosecutors that could lead to charges against Trump or top associates all seemed to gain steam last month. A special grand jury, for example, was approved in Atlanta focused on Trump’s call to Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger on 2 January last year, asking him to just “find” enough votes to block Joe Biden’s Georgia victory, a state Trump lost by more than 11,700 votes. Trump’s call for huge protests prompted the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, who is leading the criminal inquiry, to ask the FBI to do a threat assessment to protect her office and the grand jury that is slated to meet in May. Last month too a top justice official revealed that DOJ is investigating fake elector certifications declaring Trump the winner in several states he lost, a scheme reportedly pushed by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani by which vice-president Mike Pence could block Congress from certifying Biden’s win. To Trump’s chagrin, Pence rejected the plan. Further, the New York state attorney general last month stated in a court document that investigators had found evidence that Trump’s real estate business used “fraudulent or misleading” asset valuations to obtain loans and tax benefits, allegations Trump and his lawyers called politically motivated. Related: Trump’s election advisers were like ‘snake oil salesmen’, ex-Pence aide says Ex-prosecutors say that Trump’s Texas comments are dangerous and could legally boomerang as the prosecutors appear to have new momentum. “Our criminal laws seek to hold people accountable for their purposeful actions,” Paul Pelletier, a former acting chief of the fraud section at DOJ, said. “Trump’s history of inciting people to violence demonstrates that his recent remarks are likely to cause a disruption of the pending investigations against him and family members.” Pelletier added: “Should his conduct actually impede any of these investigations, federal and state obstruction statutes could easily compound Mr Trump’s criminal exposure.” Trump’s remarks resonated especially in Georgia, where former prosecutors say he may now face new legal problems. Former prosecutor Aftergut noted that Willis understood the threat when she quickly asked the FBI to provide protection at the courthouse, and he predicted that the immediate effect on the deputy DAs working on the case would be “to energize them in pursuing the case”. In a similar vein, ex-ambassador Norm Eisen and States United Democracy Center co-chair said Trump’s call for protests in Atlanta, New York and Washington if prosecutors there charge him “certainly sounds like a barely veiled call for violence. That’s particularly true when you combine it with his other statements at the Texas rally about how the last crowd of insurrectionists are being mistreated and did no wrong”. In addition, congresswoman Liz Cheney, the co-chair of the House panel investigating the 6 January Capitol assault by Trump followers, has stated that Trump’s talk of pardons and encouraging new protests suggests he would “do it all again if given the chance”. On another legal front, Aftergut pointed out that some Trump comments at the rally might help prosecutors at DOJ expand their inquiry. “Trump handed federal prosecutors another gift when he said that Mike Pence should have ‘overturned the election’.” Some veteran consultants say Trump’s latest attacks on prosecutors shows he is growing more nervous as investigations appear to be getting hotter. “Trump’s prosecutor attacks are wearing thin with the broad Republican electorate,” said Arizona Republican consultant Chuck Coughlin “He’s trying to whip up the base for his personal gain. This is another iteration of Trump’s attacks on the government.” From a broader perspective, Moore stressed that Trump’s multiple attacks on the legal system at the Texas rally represent “just another erosion of the norms of a civilized society by Trump. The truth has taken a backseat to Trumpism”.",Politics/The Guardian,"Trump’s incendiary Texas speech may have deepened his legal troubles, experts say",https://news.yahoo.com/trump-incendiary-texas-speech-may-070005756.html

Pence last week broke with former President Donald Trump and said he did not have the authority to change the election results. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida said he was ""disappointed"" in former Vice President Mike Pence when he did not attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Gaetz, while speaking on Steve Bannon's ""War Room"" podcast on Saturday, detailed his final meeting in the White House with the then-vice president. He said those in favor of overturning the election had assembled ""substantive arguments that we thought would be persuasive to state legislatures who were looking for a signal to take more aggressive action to not maintain the fiction of elections that were not run fairly."" But, Pence did not bite, Gaetz said. ""I knew then that he was not going to show a great deal of boldness before the Congress,"" said Gaetz, who is under investigation by the US Department of Justice for potential violations of sex-trafficking laws, prompting Bannon to ask if it was because Pence ""didn't understand the content of what had gone on."" —Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) February 5, 2022 Despite claims from Gaetz, former President Donald Trump, and others in the GOP, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Biden won both the Electoral College and the popular vote, making Trump a one-term president. ""It was more just the defeatism in his eyes and the tone,"" Gaetz said on Bannon's podcast. ""It reminded me of those George W. Bush years, where there was just kind of an exasperation that we had to surrender to the frame of the media, the powers that be, and that we didn't have the ability to carve out our own destiny.""

""The presidency belongs to the American people, and the American people alone,"" Pence said last week. ""And frankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president."" On Saturday, Gaetz maintained he was disappointed in Pence. ""We put forward arguments and affidavits and evidence,"" Gaetz said. ""We showed him videos. We were in the cabinet room meeting with Mike Pence in the days leading up to January 6, and I left quite disappointed that he was not motivated by our argument.""
