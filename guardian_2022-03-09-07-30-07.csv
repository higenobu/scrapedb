3/9/2022,"As Bayern’s red shapes rampaged around the Allianz Arena, running rings around their traumatised opponents, it was easy to forget that this was a fixture they had approached with a certain foreboding. Salzburg are a dangerous team, and had played well enough in the first leg to raise the spectre of a calamitous defeat. By the time Leroy Sané was slamming in the home side’s seventh goal from a tight angle, all that seemed a very long way away. Instead it was a night simply to purr and to appreciate, and for Bayern’s prospective Champions League opponents to ponder on how they might be stopped. Sané was excellent, Kingsley Coman too, Thomas Müller burgled a couple of goals in the second half and Serge Gnabry showed flickering signs of a return to form. But for all Salzburg’s impressive industry and intent, they were ultimately beaten by a player currently without equal in world football, who at the age of 33 still seems to be honing and sharpening and adding new edges. The common theme running through Robert Lewandowski’s three goals in the first 23 minutes was that all three came from 50-50 challenges. But then the very concept of a 50-50 requires reassessment when it comes to Lewandowski, a striker who simply bullies the odds, relishes the head-to-head contest, wins loose balls with a combination of superior physicality, superior intelligence and superior will. Lewandowski’s hat-trick ended his shocking recent goal drought for the Bundesliga champions, a drought that admittedly stretched to all of two games. It was a vindication of sorts, too, for Julian Nagelsmann, who was rewarded for his brave tactical setup against an accomplished counterattacking side. Nagelsmann persevered with the three-man defence that has had mixed results of late, in the knowledge that defeat would almost certainly have invited speculation about his future. Such is the lot of the Bayern manager these days, a job whose success is measured not in domestic clout (their 10th consecutive Bundesliga is virtually certain) but European progress. And so Bayern began aggressively, certainly more so than they might have been in the away goals era. Kingsley Coman and Gnabry were genuine wingers rather than wing-backs, which allowed Bayern to launch lightning-quick one-touch attacks but left them incredibly open on the counter. Within one minute it had produced the first shot on goal through Lewandowski and within two minutes a fine chance at the other end for Nicolas Capaldo. The first goal felt crucial and in a game as open as this it never felt far away. On 10 minutes Lewandowski took in a low cross from Coman and shrugged off the challenge of Max Wöber with a thrilling 180-degree turn. Swindled and humiliated, Wöber was forced to hack Lewandowski down for the penalty. Nine minutes later it was a similar story: Sané with the pass this time, Lewandowski squirming away from Wöber and gratefully accepting the clip on his ankle. And then in a twinkling it was 3-0, Müller capping a decisive counter-attack with a lovely diagonal ball into Lewandowski’s path. Goalkeeper Philipp Köhn came out, only for his clearance to hit Lewandowski and loop amenably towards the empty goal. It’s worth noting that the move had begun with a smart long pass from Manuel Neuer, restored to the team after a month out with injury and immediately giving Bayern an assurance they have recently lacked. Weirdly, we didn’t learn too much else about Bayern here. We already knew what they could do going forward. But it is at the back where they still feel a little suspect, and by the time Salzburg finally broke through the game was already well beyond saving and Bayern playing at around half-intensity. Still, a record of one clean sheet in their last eight games will certainly interest their quarter-final opponents. The Allianz was still only a quarter-full, a result of Bavaria’s strict Covid regulations, and following Bayern’s fourth goal, buried by Gnabry after an error from Mohamed Camara, a good deal of the sting seemed to go out of the game. In a way you had to feel for Salzburg: a team with a Plan A and a Plan A+, whose only real response to adversity is simply to double down, throw more chips into the pot, commit ever more fully even as confidence drains from them. There was still time for Müller to make his mark, collecting Sané’s pass early in the second half, finishing low from 18 yards and celebrating with a feral roar, as if he’d just severed the head of an ox rather than scored the fifth goal in a routine demolition of a team named after a soft drink. The 18-year-old Maurits Kjaergaard, the latest off the famous Red Bull production line, reduced the deficit with a fine shot from a tight angle. But Bayern would have the last word, Müller finishing low in a packed penalty area and Sané issuing the final insult. Call it what you like: a demolition, a humiliation, a ruthless show of strength. Of course Bayern have their flaws. But there are few teams better at covering them up.",Sport/Football,Lewandowski’s 11-minute hat-trick puts Bayern on course for 7-1 rout of Salzburg,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/bayern-munich-rb-salzburg-champions-league-match-report
3/9/2022,"For Internazionale, it had the feel of an impossible job. In 34 previous European ties in which Liverpool had won the first-leg away from home, the Premier League team had never failed to progress. Liverpool had brought all-conquering form into the tie as they sought to confirm their place in the Champions League quarter-finals. Inter had been patchy. Yet the Italian champions had a blueprint to manoeuvre the ball efficiently and, when Lautaro Martínez aimed a firecracker into the top corner just after the hour – it had Alisson beaten from the moment of discharge – they had the scent of something more. Liverpool had hit the post twice – through Joel Matip and Mohamed Salah – and they faced a test of their nerve. To great delight and no little relief, they passed it. Their task was made easier when Alexis Sánchez was sent off almost immediately after the goal for a second bookable offence. Salah would rattle the upright again but, if the ball would not go in for him or his team, at least Inter could not find the equaliser. Simone Inzaghi had to find a way for Inter to trouble Alisson in the Liverpool goal much more than his team had managed to do three weeks previously. Alexis Sánchez in, Edin Dzeko out was his big move for the starting XI. The visitors had an easy confidence on the ball, able to find their men in their well-drilled 3-5-2 system and they wondered whether they could spring either Sánchez or Martínez in behind a Liverpool backline that was positioned typically high. Klopp could be grateful to the pace of Andy Robertson and a couple of important defensive interventions from Trent Alexander-Arnold in the opening quarter. Liverpool wanted to win the ball high up and they brought the pressure from the first whistle but Inter did not panic. The first goal always stood to be crucial and, in a strange way – despite Liverpool’s advantage from Milan – it felt delicately poised. There was a break in play on 25 minutes so that medics could attend to a medical emergency in the Kop and, as everybody hoped for the best and the home crowd sang supportively, their team took stock. Virgil van Dijk had headed straight at Samir Handanovic from a corner but that was it in terms of chances and there had been one or two mutters from the fans as moves broke down. Liverpool resumed with more force and, as in the first-leg, they threatened from set-pieces. If Inter were unhappy at how they had lost Roberto Firmino and Salah for the goals in Milan, they were relieved after they did the same thing with Joël Matip on a 31st-minute Alexander-Arnold free-kick and watched him direct a header against the crossbar. From the next action, an Alexander-Arnold corner, Van Dijk almost got in only to glance his header off Milan Skriniar and past the post. Alexander-Arnold would also whistle a free-kick wide in first-half stoppage-time. Inter have never lost a European first-leg at home by a two-goal margin and the set-back came during a string of poor results – four games without a victory in Serie A, a run that has seen them edged out of top spot by their city rivals, Milan, and which only ended last Friday with the 5-0 victory over bottom-of-the-table Salernitana. Could they get anything before the interval from a performance featuring plenty of polish in possession? The answer was no. Marcelo Brozovic tried to usher Martínez through only to see Van Dijk hoover up the ground and slam the door shut while their big moment came in the 41st minute when Hakan Calhanoglu whipped in a low free-kick from the right, bouncing it just in front of Alisson. The goalkeeper was not distracted by the onrushing Inter players and showed strong and safe hands to push the ball. Salah ought to have eased any potential for anxiety early in the second half when the ball broke to him inside the area. The chance had been sparked by a lob forward by Thiago and it led to a dramatic full-length dive by Handanovic, although he could not clear. Salah had plenty of the goal to aim at. He hit the post. Inter fashioned their life-line moments after Martínez had seen a shot deflected wide by Robertson when he had been well placed. Ivan Perisic collected a loose ball up the line from Matip and Sánchez worked it forward for Martínez. What followed was a celebration of technique and audacity, the right-footed shot from outside the area fizzing into the far top corner. Inter had hope. Then they had 10 men. Sánchez had been booked at the end of the first half for a horrrible lunge at Thiago, raking his studs down the lower leg of his opponent. The second yellow card was more contentious. Sánchez stretched to play the ball but he then caught Fabinho with his follow-through. According to the letter of the law, he was out of control. Liverpool pushed again and, when Sadio Mané crossed, Salah arrived to guide a first-time effort against the post. At the death, Arturo Vidal would somehow deny the substitute, Luis Díaz. Liverpool had done enough.",Sport/Football,Martínez cracker gives Inter hope but Liverpool advance after Sánchez red,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/liverpool-internazionale-champions-league-match-report
3/9/2022,"For the first time in over two years England’s army of travelling supporters took over a Test ground away from home, their St George’s flags draped all over the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium like towels on the beach well before a ball had been bowled. By the close, as a woozy sun began its final descent and thoughts turned to Antigua’s evening attractions, they had witnessed an absorbing first day of this three-match series against West Indies. It featured a sparkling unbeaten 109 from one of their long-time favourites, Jonny Bairstow, and saw England reach 268 for six. Equally there was a reminder that the post-Ashes “red-ball reset” may not be instant. Things had certainly begun in all-too familiar fashion after Joe Root won the toss on a beige pitch with barely a blade of grass to be seen, four wickets falling inside the first 16 overs as West Indies flew out of the traps. Kemar Roach led the charge in typically waspish fashion, ruining the debut of Alex Lees, lbw for four, and bowling Root on 13 without a shot offered when he got one to swing in, nip further and kiss the off bail. But from 48 for four resistance came from the engine room of a side that features six changes from the end of that sorry Australian campaign. First came a stand of 67 between Bairstow and Ben Stokes, the all-rounder personally chiselling out 36 either side of lunch, before Ben Foakes combined with the Yorkshireman for a 99-run partnership. Chris Woakes then held firm to walk off at the end 24 not out. This was a typically bristling, characterful innings from Bairstow, continuing the form witnessed during scores of 131 and 41 in Sydney and adding to the sense that a talent on the brink of being lost to white-ball specialism is being reborn. Determinedly moving to his half-century from 127 balls, Bairstow then spent the evening session wielding his bat like a blacksmith’s hammer every time the West Indies attack dropped short. There was one heart in mouth moment for the England supporters – if not the man himself – when Bairstow successfully overturned a caught behind off-spinner Veerasammy Permaul on 59. But come the 78th over they broke out into rum-fuelled song when the 32-year-old swept the shoddy off-breaks of Kraigg Brathwaite for Test century number eight and his latest look to the heavens above. That England didn’t fold also owed much to Stokes, even if he battled for rhythm and his eventual demise – bowled by Jayden Seales off the inside edge – frustrated. So, too, Foakes, with the wicketkeeping gloves having returned to a cricketer who wants to show his game is more than just silken work behind the stumps. Shirt sleeves buttoned down and with a smear of zinc cream across his bottom lip, the 29-year-old produced a gem of his own first-up, caressing eight fours in an 87-ball 42 that surpassed the best of Jos Buttler’s last 15 Test innings before the axe fell. A typically fine piece of bowling from Jason Holder eventually removed Foakes after tea, the former skipper jagging one in for a plumb lbw and finishing the day with standout figures of two for 15 from 16 overs. Seales, the young Trinidadian, also struck twice to show his promise but as the day wore on, he and the at-times unfortunate Alzarri Joseph (none for 69), began to look leggy. Roach’s best work came when the ball was at its hardest, enjoying lavish swing that should encourage England. This proved lethal first thing, with the only misstep from the hosts coming when the two teams lined up and the original upbeat version of Rally ’Round the West Indies, David Rudder’s seminal calypso, blared out of the stadium’s speakers, rather than its slow and stirring equivalent that serves as the cricketing anthem of this region. Perhaps this extra soca vibe put a spring in the steps of a West Indies team that has Holder slated at No 6 to allow four quicks plus a spinner; perhaps it further disorientated a visiting side that during the seven weeks between Test matches has lost its director of cricket, head coach, his assistant and seen eight players dropped, including two all-time greats in Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. Among the newcomers is Lees who, after receiving his cap from Bairstow before play, lasted nine balls before Roach found the pad of a leaden front-leg from around the wicket. Zak Crawley, among the survivors, lasted two balls more, with a couple of handsome fours followed by a loose on-drive off Seales that produced a sparkling one-handed reflex catch down leg from Joshua Da Silva behind the stumps. When Root was bowled offering no shot for the first time in his Test career – perhaps a recalibration issue after the bounce of Australia, but a fine victory for Roach nonetheless - and the recalled Dan Lawrence at No 4 edged to second slip on 20 during an impeccable spell of five overs, five maidens from Holder, alarm bells were ringing. But through the gumption of Bairstow and the rhyming triplets Stokes, Foakes and Woakes – playing in the same Test XI for the first time – England avoided a harrowing start to this new dawn and, who knows, may well now pass 300 for the first time this winter.",Sport/Sport,Jonny Bairstow rescues England with ton after West Indies strike early blows,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/08/jonny-bairstow-rescues-england-with-ton-after-west-indies-strike-early-blows
3/9/2022,"England are still hoping Tom Curry and Alex Dombrandt will be available to face Ireland after both forwards were included in a 26-man squad for Saturday’s penultimate Six Nations weekend. Wasps’ uncapped forward Alfie Barbeary, though, has been retained as cover with his clubmate Joe Launchbury poised for his first matchday involvement in this year’s tournament at the expense of Saracens’ Nick Isiekwe. Curry came off at half-time against Wales after failing a head injury assessment while Dombrandt has been in isolation since testing positive for Covid-19 last Friday. The absence of the fit-again Sam Underhill suggests England remain optimistic about Curry’s prognosis, with Exeter’s Sam Simmonds on hand to join the starting back row if Dombrandt cannot train on Thursday. It is more than possible England will field a mere four starting survivors from last year’s 32-18 defeat in Dublin when Ireland took a firm early grip and never let go. With the Vunipola brothers dropped, Mark Wilson having retired and injury having sidelined five others, it may be that only Curry, Kyle Sinckler, Maro Itoje and Charlie Ewels kick off both games. The hosts are already braced for a seriously physical encounter amid suggestions Twickenham could witness a “bar-room brawl” on Saturday. The former Ireland coach Eddie O’Sullivan believes the home side will be wanting to make a no-nonsense statement and England’s prop Joe Marler also anticipates a “ding-dong” contest this weekend. Scotland will complete their Guinness Six Nations campaign without Duhan van der Merwe [pictured]. The 26-year-old has been hit with a three-week ban after he was sent off for reckless or dangerous play during Worcester's defeat at London Irish in the Premiership on Saturday. He will be unavailable for Gregor Townsend's side's remaining games against Italy and Ireland. ""[Van der Merwe] accepted that foul play occurred but questioned whether the red card threshold had been met,"" read a statement. ""The panel upheld the red card and Van der Merwe received a three-week ban, however, subject to completing the World Rugby Coaching Intervention programme he will be free again to play against Gloucester on 25 March."" O’Sullivan’s view is that England are potentially dangerous opponents because they will be desperate not to finish in the championship’s bottom half for a second consecutive season. “If they lose their last two Six Nations games it will be very difficult,” O’Sullivan told BBC Radio Ulster. “They need a result and for that reason they are very dangerous. This will be a bar-room brawl and we need to be ready for it.” Marler, England’s most seasoned forward, does not disagree with him. “It’s probably a fair assumption. A nice, clean bar brawl, though, none of the dirty stuff. No gouging or glass-throwing, just the clean stuff. They are very aggressive at the breakdown and love chucking numbers in there. So it is going to be a ding-dong.” For that reason, according to the 31-year-old Marler, there has been an extra edge to England training in Bagshot with Eddie Jones’s side facing daunting fixtures against Ireland and France on successive weekends. “There’s definitely a bigger sense of ‘OK, Ireland are very good’. With the greatest respect Wales were missing a fair few names. There was probably a little more expectation on us to win that game whereas Ireland are full bore and have been together for some time now. It was definitely noticeable in training.” Marler, though, also says he can barely recall England not being the favourites to win at home, as Jones has been suggesting this week. ‘I don’t think I’ve ever felt like an underdog at Twickenham … maybe against New Zealand once. [But] we know how good they are so we have to be right on the money. We’ll have to be sugar-hot in order to get the win. Most games are won by the most physically dominant team. We’ll need to win that battle in order to put them under enough pressure to give us time to put our game on the park.” The Six Nations, meanwhile, is to stage an inaugural Under-18 women’s tournament in Edinburgh next month.",Sport/Sport,England hopeful Curry and Dombrandt will be fit to face Ireland in Six Nations ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/08/england-ireland-rugby-union-six-nations-alex-dombrandt-tom-curry
3/9/2022,"The eldest son of a Tory MP and former government minister is among a group of British ex-servicemen who have joined the war in Ukraine. Ben Grant, 30, who spent more than five years as a commando in the Royal Marines, is part of group of seven ex-servicemen who arrived in Ukraine over the weekend to fight invading Russian forces. His mother is Helen Grant, the Conservative MP for Maidstone and Boris Johnson’s special envoy on girls’ education. She is also a former minister for sport and tourism. The Guardian spoke to Grant in the ticket hall of Lviv station on Saturday as he waited to board a train for Kyiv. He said: “I haven’t been sent, nothing to do with the government, nothing to do with my mother. Just wanna make that clear, completely off my own back, I decided to do this. I didn’t even tell my mum, but it is what it is.” Grant, said he chose to head for Ukraine after seeing footage of Russian bombing of a house where a child could be heard screaming. He said: “I thought, I am a father of three, and if that was my kids I know what I would do, I would go and fight. Then I thought I would want another load of people who might be skilled enough to help me come and help me, come and help me, save my family.” Grant said he expects scores more ex-servicemen to join from the UK. He said: “In total we have another 100 people coming, so this will be really good when they all get here – different backgrounds, some of them are very, very specialist.” Last week the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, was criticised after saying the UK would she would back Britons going to Ukraine to fight Russia. And on Sunday the chief of the defence staff, Tony Radakin, urged the public not to head to Ukraine. He said: “We’ve been very clear that it’s unlawful as well as unhelpful for UK military and for the UK population to start going towards Ukraine.” The risk for foreign fighters in Ukraine was underlined last week when Russia threatened to bring “criminal” prosecution against them. Russian defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said: “None of the mercenaries the West is sending to Ukraine to fight for the nationalist regime in Kyiv can be considered as combatants in accordance with international humanitarian law or enjoy the status of prisoners of war.” Grant said he knows that Russia army is not sticking to the Geneva convention and is shooting journalists and civilians. He said he would rather take his own life than be taken prisoner. He said: “If it comes to me being able to end my life before getting captured, I probably would do that. I mentally prepared myself for that, but let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.” He added: “Yes, I am scared but I know it’s the right thing, pretty easy decision to make.” Asked about joining the Ukrainian army he said: “They are strong, they don’t look frightened, they look ready. Will be great to be part of a team that looks ready. They look great, they got fires in their bellies, I want to be part of that to help.” Grant also told Reuters that he would wait to see how he and his comrades would be deployed. “Who knows, maybe an independent unit is what gets formed,” he said as Ukrainians thanked him for coming. Grant, who has been working as a security contractor in Iraq, described how he broke the news to his family. He said: “I was over in Iraq and was there for few months and then flew home, saw my missus and kids, hadn’t seen them for a while, and basically said: ‘I’m going to Ukraine.’ So big shock, I feel a bit sorry for them to be fair … they were pretty upset, but people need me here.” One of Grant’s comrades, who identified himself only as Ash from London, said he wanted to go to Ukraine after seeing a video of a plane firing a missile at a family’s home. Another gave his name as Jax, and like Grant said he had worked in private security in Iraq. He said: “I left £4,500 a month to come here.” Jax said his family was supportive, and said they know that once he made up his mind, he “couldn’t be budged”. He added: “I’ll stay to the bitter end, even if I’ll take a bullet to the chest.” Helen Grant has been contacted for comment.",News/World news,Tory MP’s son among UK ex-servicemen heading to Ukrainian front line,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/tory-mps-son-among-uk-ex-servicemen-heading-to-ukrainian-front-line
3/9/2022,"Ukraine’s embattled armed forces desperately need combat aircraft to help the country fight off the Russian invasion. Its air force, though still flying, remains outnumbered by its opponent. However, any new planes need to be ones that Ukraine’s pilots are trained to use. That means they need to be Russian-made planes, principally the MiG-29 fighter. Some still eastern European countries have MiGs in their fleets, which a week ago, the EU said it hoped could be given to Ukraine. After a period where the deal seemed off, Poland said on Tuesday evening that it is willing to hand over its fleet of 28 MiG 29s to the US – which is in turn expected to pass them on to the Ukrainian air force. Poland is also expecting the US to supply it with more advanced F-16s to fill the gap. Western countries have been supplying increasingly sophisticated arms to Ukraine in so it can fight off the Russian advance. So far the anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles that have been supplied have irritated Russia, but not led to any direct retaliation against any country involved. Giving Ukraine fast jets is clearly a step up, and Poland is sufficiently nervous about the Kremlin reaction that it using the US as an intermediary to help get the combat aircraft to Kyiv, although the manoeuvre is hardly subtle. The Russian Ministry of Defence has warned that if warplanes based in another country were to attack Russian targets, then “could be considered as those countries’ engagement in the military conflict”. But if the US is transferring the fighters to Ukraine, Russia may not want to engage the Americans directly. It is still thought unlikely that Russia would want to retaliate against Poland militarily, on the grounds that it is a member of Nato. But Russia may consider other actions against Warsaw, perhaps special economic sanctions. Despite a spirited defence by Ukraine of its territory and the anti-tank and anti-air weapons already supplied by the west, Russia’s advance has ground on, although with heavier than expected losses of troops and material. If what is left of Ukraine’s air force were to sustain further losses it would soon reach the point where it is unable to defend itself from attack in the skies. A new fleet of aircraft would ensure the airspace above Ukraine remains contested at least for a time, and would make Russia think twice about airstrikes on Kyiv. But the main problem faced by Ukraine’s armed forces at present, is Russia’s preponderance in artillery. Russia has been shelling cities such as Kharkiv and Mariupol for several days in an attempt to force their surrender. Ukraine could try to use its planes to strike enemy convoys from the air, but that would be fraught with risk as Russia is thought to have brought air defence systems closer to the frontline in the past few days.",News/World news,Why is Poland giving MiG-29 fighter jets to the US – and is it a risky move?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/why-is-poland-giving-mig-29-fighter-jets-to-us-risky-move
