5/2/2022,"By Kantaro Komiya and Kentaro Sugiyama TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese mother of three Maiko Takahashi was never one to pinch pennies or accept hand-me-downs for her children even though circumstances for her single-income family have always been fairly modest. But times have changed. Nowadays, she has no trouble with used clothes and her pursuit of bargains and scrimping on the most trifling costs borders on the obsessive. ""I've started to pay close attention to tips on TV shows, like minimising the number of times you open the fridge to save electricity,"" said Takahashi, whose family of five lives in suburbs north of Tokyo. ""We've started to feel the pinch going about things the usual way so I've made adjustments."" Takahashi's behaviour is mirrored by a growing number of consumers and underlines a worrying trend for Japan. After lifting two years of on-and-off coronavirus curbs in March, the government was counting on what's known as ""revenge spending"", pent-up demand triggering a splurge that boosts consumption and a moribund economy, as has been seen in the United States, China and some other major economies. But with energy, food and other living costs soaring - exacerbated in recent months by a sharp decline in the yen and the war in Ukraine - those hopes are fading fast. Facing the prospect of struggling with rising prices, Japan's famously thrifty consumers are tightening their belts even as they sit on the remains of an estimated 50 trillion yen ($383 billion) - equivalent to 9% of the economy - in ""forced savings"", as the Bank of Japan calls it, accrued during the pandemic. Some bigger companies have answered a government call to raise wages but the gains of some 2% will be swallowed up by higher prices of everything from flour, to diapers and beer, economists say. In March, electricity prices in resources-poor Japan jumped 22% from the previous year - the most in more than four decades. The government recently upgraded its assessment of the economy for the first time in four months, citing an expected recovery in spending, but added a caveat that the outlook was clouded. ""The chance of a 'revenge spending' burst is becoming smaller than we had expected,"" a government official said in unusually candid remarks, noting that prospects were especially uncertain beyond the summer. FINAL FEAST With more than 90% of consumers saying in the latest government survey that they expected everyday goods to become more expensive over the next 12 months, economists say it is no surprise to see behaviour like Takahashi's. In addition to accepting used uniforms for her son entering kindergarten, and venturing further in search of discounts, the stay-at-home-mum said she has switched to lower-cost private brands (PB) for mayonnaise, ketchup and other food. She's not alone. The share of so-called PB items for mayonnaise purchases nationwide rose to 22% in March from 18% a year earlier, according to market research firm Intage Inc. Supermarket giant Aeon Co saw PB food sales jump 15% in the six months to February. The ""Golden Week"" holiday, which began on Friday, is the first in three years without COVID-19 restrictions, and the economy should see a dramatic improvement in spending but that is likely to be the high point for consumption this year, said Daiwa Securities senior economist Toru Suehiro. ""The full-fledged impact of rising costs will emerge in the July-September quarter and later, so the Golden Week will probably be the last feast of the year,"" he said. The number of holiday travellers is expected to grow about 70% from last year, but still a third short of pre-pandemic levels, according to JTB Corp, Japan's biggest travel agency. The yen's fall to two-decade lows would normally be a boon for in-bound travellers, but Japan, fearing COVID, has kept its borders closed to tourists. In 2019, almost 32 million foreign tourists contributed to the economy. Meanwhile, the weak yen has caused pain for many companies by increasing input costs, making them just as cautious as consumers - and reluctant to raise wages. ""Prices keep rising and rising for items we can't live without, while salaries are flat,"" Takahashi said. ""I'm constantly racking my brains over what I can skimp on next.""

5/2/2022,"Lindell was banned from Twitter in 2021 over election misinformation but rejoined the platform on Sunday. The account was quickly banned for violating Twitter's ban evasion policy. ""Jack Dorsey should be first in line for prison!"" Lindell told Insider via text. MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell was banned from Twitter on Sunday hours after making a return to the platform. Lindell, a supporter of former President Donald Trump, was banned from Twitter in January 2021 for spreading misinformation about the 2020 election. On Sunday afternoon, he posted to a new account announcing his return. ""Hello everybody, I'M BACK ON TWITTER. My only account is @MikeJLindell! Please RT and FOLLOW to SPREAD THE WORD,"" Lindell said in a tweet, Insider's Bethany Biron reported. The tweet also featured a video of Lindell confirming the account was in fact his. ""All those other ones are fake accounts and they've been using my name out there, so we started this account,"" he said. ""Please share with everybody you know, let everybody you know, so we can get the word out at Twitter in case they do take it down. Thanks a lot for helping out."" About three and a half hours later, the account was suspended. A Twitter spokesperson told Insider the account was permanently suspended for violating the platform's rules on ban evasion. Twitter's ban evasion policy prohibits anyone from trying to evade a previous ban, including by creating a new account. Lindell was initially banned from Twitter for violating the platform's rules on misinformation and its civic-integrity policy, which prohibits sharing false or misleading information about how to vote or election outcomes. Lindell told Insider Twitter did not give him a reason for the latest ban but called it a ""shame."" ""We need to melt down the voting machines and turn them into prison bars,"" Lindell said, referencing his own efforts to have voting machines blocked from use in US elections. ""Jack Dorsey should be first in line for prison!"" Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey stepped down as CEO in November. Dorsey is still on Twitter's board but has said he plans to leave when his term expires in late May. Lindell also said he decided to rejoin Twitter because others were creating fake accounts pretending to be him. ""I put up the Twitter account today to let the public know that none of the fake Mike Lindell accounts on Twitter are mine,"" Lindell said, adding that he is still on his own social media platform Frank Social. His attempt to rejoin the platform came after Twitter announced on Monday that Elon Musk was buying the platform in a $44 billion deal. The Tesla and SpaceX billionaire has said he is interested in promoting ""free speech"" on the platform, prompting speculation about potential changes to Twitter's content moderation policies and previous bans. Sources recently told The Wall Street Journal that Musk is dismayed that Trump is still banned from Twitter, but the former president previously said he does not plan to return to the platform even if Musk takes over. ""I hope Elon buys Twitter because he'll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on TRUTH,"" Trump told Fox News, referring to his own social media platform Truth Social.

5/2/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia believes the risks of nuclear war should be kept to a minimum and that any armed conflict between nuclear powers should be prevented, the TASS news agency quoted a foreign ministry official as saying on Saturday. Vladimir Yermakov, the foreign ministry's head of nuclear non-proliferation, said all nuclear powers must stick to the logic laid out in official documents aimed at preventing nuclear war. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday the West should not underestimate the elevated risks of nuclear conflict over Ukraine, although the United States subsequently said it did not believe there was a threat of Russia using nuclear weapons despite an escalation in Moscow's rhetoric. Yermakov on Saturday was quoted as saying that leading nuclear powers must adhere to the logic enshrined in documents they have jointly created. He was referring to a joint statement published in January by Russia, China, Britain, the United States and France, in which the five countries - which are the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council - agreed that the further spread of nuclear arms and a nuclear war should be avoided. ""The risks of nuclear war, which should never be unleashed, must be kept to a minimum, in particular through preventing any armed conflict between nuclear powers,"" TASS quoted Yermakov as saying on Saturday. ""Russia clearly follows this understanding.""

5/2/2022,"A pack of dogs killed an Alabama public health worker who was investigating a previous attack, officials said. Jacqueline Summer Beard, an employee with the Alabama Department of Public Health, was following up with the dogs’ owner on Friday, April 29, just outside Red Bay after an incident earlier in the week in which the dogs attacked a woman, according to a Facebook post from the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office. Investigators believe Beard was trying to contact the owner when the dogs attacked her, the sheriff’s office said. Deputies were called to the area about a suspicious vehicle, according to the sheriff’s office. When they arrived, they found Beard, and she was pronounced dead at the scene. While deputies were on the scene, the dogs started attacking residents in the area, including one person who suffered minor injuries, the sheriff’s office said. Some of the dogs were immediately euthanized. Brandy Dowdy, who WAFF reports is the owner of the dogs, was arrested and is accused of manslaughter and “dangerous dog law,” the sheriff’s office said. Beard’s death is under investigation. The Alabama Department of Public Health told AL.com that Beard had worked for the agency for about 17 years. “The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) extends our deepest sympathy to the family, friends, and colleagues of Summer Beard, after her tragic passing,” Ryan Easterling, a department spokesperson, said in a statement to the outlet. “Summer was known to her coworkers as an exceptional person. She was a tremendous team worker and was loved by those who knew her.” Red Bay is near the Mississippi state line, about 120 miles northwest of Birmingham.
