4/14/2022,"STORY: The presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia on Wednesday visited Ukraine in the latest show of support and toured the bombed-out ruins of buildings in the town of Borodyanka. This city bore the brunt of a vicious Russian bombardment and occupation before Ukrainian forces liberated it, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the damage to Borodyanka is ""significantly more dreadful"" than nearby Bucha with respect to suspected killings of civilians. Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia all share a border with Russia. Speaking in English, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda compared the cruelty of the Russian onslaught to that of Nazi Germany: ""It's even difficult to express in words, by seeing what has happened here, what are the damages and how cruel is this regime. I just cannot compare even with Nazis, I think this is worse than Nazis."" These four leaders join a growing number of European politicians to visit the Ukrainian capital since Russian forces were driven back by fierce Ukrainian resistance earlier this month. The visit comes the day after U.S. President Joe Biden said Moscow's invasion of Ukraine amounted to genocide. In a report issued Wednesday, a mission set up by Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said it has found evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 on what he calls a ""special military operation."" Russia has denied that its forces targeted civilians and has said Ukrainian and Western allegations of war crimes are fabricated. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression. The visiting Polish and Baltic leaders met with Zelenskiy, clapping backs and embracing. A spokesperson for the Estonian president said the meeting focused on military assistance and aid to Ukrainian civilians.",Politics/Reuters Videos,"Polish, Baltic leaders visit Zelenskiy, pledge support",https://news.yahoo.com/polish-baltic-leaders-visit-zelenskiy-201307084.html
4/14/2022,"Russia’s Vladimir Putin hailed his “brave” and “effective” troops in Ukraine on Tuesday, even as social-media posts surfaced showing the Russian military suffered yet another setback after more than 40 days of war. The Russian leader vowed that his “noble” war against Ukraine would be successful and defiantly said his country could not be isolated from the rest of the world. “There is no doubt that the goals and tasks of the operation in Ukraine will be fulfilled,” he said, claiming “confrontation with the growing anti-Russian forces in Ukraine was inevitable” and only “a question of time.” “The Russian Armed Forces have acted bravely, efficiently, and effectively in the course of the special military operation in Ukraine, using the most contemporary kinds of weapons,” he said. “What we are doing is helping people, saving people, on the one hand, and on the other hand—we are simply taking measures to ensure the security of Russia itself. It’s evident that we had no other choice, this is the right decision,” he said, according to Russia’s Interfax news agency. His glowing assessment comes amid reports that another high-ranking military official was killed in Ukraine. Lt. Col. Dibir Dibirovich Magomedovich, a Dagestan native, was killed on April 9, according to a now-deleted post on the VK page of a Russian military academy. A screenshot of the since-deleted post shared by Ukrainian media outlets shows that people were invited to make donations to Magomedovich’s family. Magomedovich was reportedly based in Chechnya with the 291st Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment of the 42nd Guards Motorized Rifle Division. No details were given on where, and in what circumstances, he was killed. His death adds to a long list of senior military brass killed in Ukraine, as Russia goes all in on drumming up support for the war at home, with huge “Z” symbols popping up on theaters and museums around the country, and schoolchildren instructed to write letters of support to Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Meanwhile, evidence of possible Russian war crimes in the country has continued to grow, as Ukraine’s human-rights ombudswoman told The New York Times and the BBC that Russian troops held more than two dozen women captive in a basement in Bucha while they occupied the devastated town. Nine of the women in that group—which included girls as young as 14—are now pregnant, according to the ombudswoman, Lyudmila Denisova. “Russian soldiers told them they would rape them to the point where they wouldn’t want sexual contact with any man, to prevent them from having Ukrainian children,” Denisova told the BBC. In one of the most heinous allegations against Russian troops so far, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday confirmed reports that a Russian soldier sent around video of himself sexually assaulting a baby. “That is such a Russian military ‘defender of children,’” Zelensky said in a speech before the Lithuanian parliament, quipping that Russian propagandists will likely claim the alleged abuse was “protecting Russian speakers.” According to Russian media reports, the soldier in question, Aleksei Bychkov, was arrested on Russian territory, where he serves in Pskov. It was not clear where the alleged attack on the child took place. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

4/14/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In anticipation of a new Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine, President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved an $800 million package of military assistance, including additional helicopters and the first provision of American artillery. The Ukrainians also will receive armored personnel carriers, armored Humvees, naval drone vessels used in coastal defense, and gear and equipment used to protect soldiers in chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological attacks. “This new package of assistance will contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine,” Biden said in a statement. “The steady supply of weapons the United States and its allies and partners have provided to Ukraine has been critical in sustaining its fight against the Russian invasion,” Biden added. “It has helped ensure that (Russia President Vladimir) Putin failed in his initial war aims to conquer and control Ukraine. We cannot rest now.” Biden announced the aid after a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. It is the latest in a series of U.S. security assistance packages valued at a combined $2.6 billion that has been committed to Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. The weaponry and support material has played an important role in Ukraine's successful defense thus far. Biden is under pressure from members of both parties in Congress to expand and accelerate U.S. aid. Robert Gates, a former CIA director and defense secretary, said Wednesday he believes the administration needs to push hard for weapon donations by NATO members in Eastern Europe, whose arsenals include Soviet-era tanks and other weaponry and equipment that could help Ukraine immediately. “The United States ought to be acting, 24/7 — how do we mobilize the equipment and how do we get it into Ukraine and into the hands of the Ukrainians,” Gates said in an online forum sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “It's critically important and critically urgent, and we ought to be sort of ransacking the arsenals of those states, and I think they would be cooperative, particularly” if they are given assurances that the Pentagon will provide American replacements for the donated weapons. The Pentagon said the $800 million package announced by Biden includes weapons and equipment that will require some training for a Ukrainian military not fully accustomed to American military technology. U.S. and allied forces had been present inside Ukraine to provide training for eight years before pulling out in advance of the Russia's latest invasion. The new arms package includes 18 of the U.S. Army's 155mm howitzers and 40,000 artillery rounds, two air surveillance radars, 300 Switchblade “kamikaze” armed drones, and 500 Javelin missiles designed to knock out tanks and other armor. Also included are 10 counter-artillery radars used to track incoming artillery and other projectiles to determine their point of origin for counter attacks. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said delivery of the material will be expedited, but he offered no specific timetable. “This list came directly out of multiple conversations with Ukrainians in the last few days as we began to see the Russians now start to reprioritize the Donbas fight,” he said, referring to Russia's shift from a failed offensive in Ukraine's north aimed at Kyiv, the capital, to a force buildup in the country's eastern Donbas region, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting since 2014. Ukrainian military personnel will need training on the radars as well as the howitzers and the Switchblade drones, Kirby said. He said the training may be done by U.S. soldiers in Europe and the arrangements are being worked out. “These are not highly complex systems,” Kirby said, and so extensive training will not likely be required. Among the other items in the package are 11 Soviet-era Mi-17 helicopters that the United States had planned to provide to Afghanistan before Biden last year decided to fully withdraw from the country. They are transport helicopters that also can function in an attack role. The Pentagon previously had sent five Mi-17s to Ukraine, Kirby said.",World/Associated Press,Biden approves $800M in new military assistance for Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-approves-800m-artillery-helicopters-181849360.html
4/14/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - Russia is beefing up its forces for a new assault on Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, setting the stage for a protracted battle that is certain to inflict heavy losses on both sides as the Russians try to encircle Ukraine's fighters, analysts said. Military analysts are wary of predicting who will win the battle for Ukraine's industrial heartland of Donbas, a crucial conflict that will likely be brutal and ultimately define the course of the war. ""The outcome of the battle could be that both sides will be battered to the point when neither one will be able to conduct an offensive or a counter-offensive,"" said Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy. ""Ukrainians will defend their land to the last man. The Russians will incur significant losses."" An uneasy ""frozen"" conflict could emerge and last for months with the constant threat of a fresh assault by Moscow, he said. Russia describes its campaign, which began in February, as a special operation to degrade Ukraine's military capabilities and root out dangerous nationalists. A protracted battle would frustrate any hopes that President Vladimir Putin has of declaring a significant victory in time for May 9 when Russia marks victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two with a huge military parade that the Kremlin leader oversees every year. Outgunned by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksiy has called on the West to help save his country. He wants NATO to help police its airspace and the West to ship more fighter aircraft, missiles and anti-tank rockets. Moscow began pulling out its forces from near Kyiv and Ukraine's north late last month in order, it said, to focus on taking the Donbas. Even without reinforcements now arriving, Russia's invasion has slowly pushed back Ukrainian fighters in some areas of the Donbas and secured around 90% of Luhansk region, said Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst at the RUSI think-tank in London. Ukraine's troops have held on more robustly in Donetsk, which together with Luhansk makes up Russian-speaking Donbas, a swathe of which was seized by Russia-backed separatists in 2014. A significant Ukrainian contingent has been dug in since then. Moscow could try to punch through Ukraine's eastern front while advancing with troops, tanks and armoured vehicles from the north and south in a pincer movement. That would seek to outflank and surround Ukrainian forces from behind, the analysts said. Ukraine will likely try to avoid open tank battles, using artillery to target supply lines and equipment, and send raiding teams to attack convoys and logistics lines, analysts said. Fearing that their forces could be encircled, Ukrainian strategists will have to evaluate constantly whether they should pull the fighters back to avoid a quick, chaotic retreat in which they could become separated or smashed by artillery and aerial fire. ""It's disengaging from ... the front line that's going to be the problem. That's one of the calls the Ukrainians are going to have to make,"" Reynolds said. CAN MARIUPOL HOLD OUT? At the southern edge of Donetsk region on the Sea of Azov, Russia looks poised to wrest full control of the besieged port city of Mariupol where exhausted Ukrainian marines have been desperately holding out, Reynolds said. ""Unless the Russian advance runs out of steam with logistics and morale, I think Mariupol is unfortunately done...If Mariupol falls, it frees up a lot of manpower for other parts of (Russia's) advance,"" Reynolds said. Russia could launch its fresh Donbas assault as early as the end of this week or next week when reinforcements have arrived from Russia and Belarus as well as Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy in Ukraine, Muzyka said. U.S. private firm Maxar released satellite images taken on Friday showing an eight-mile-long Russian military convoy of armoured vehicles and trucks towing artillery and support kit east of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv heading south towards the Donbas. Russia's northern pincer advance would likely push south from the town of Izyum that lies strategically on the road towards the Ukrainian-held towns of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. The governor of Donetsk region said on Tuesday that Russia looked like it was in the final phase of regrouping and was pounding the region with shelling around the clock. ""We are going to see a prolonged battle for Donbas. Russia has chances to prevail but only because of its preponderance of firepower and equipment and manpower, and not because of operational superiority,"" said Muzyka.

4/14/2022,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday issued a new English-language plea for heavy weaponry as Russia’s invasion enters its eighth week. Wearing his signature look — a military green short-sleeved T-shirt — Zelensky said since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his troops have learned they “had no idea who they were up against.” “Russia didn’t know how much we cherish our freedom — we’ve been defending ourselves against Russia much longer than the invaders planned,” Zelensky said in a video shared on Twitter. “We have destroyed more Russian weapons and military equipment than some armies in Europe currently possess. “But this is not enough,” the wartime leader — who has been compared to Winston Churchill — said as he went on to detail each weapon Ukraine needs in order to fight off Russia. “Artillery, 155 millimeters. Artillery shells, 152 millimeters — as many as possible. Multiple Launch Rocket Systems — Grad, Smerch, Tornado and M142 HIMARS.” Zelensky said Ukraine needs armored vehicles, APCs (armored personnel carriers) and infantry fighting vehicles, among others. “Tanks, T-72 or similar tanks from the U.S.A. or Germany,” are wanted too. Ukraine is also seeking air defense systems, including the S-300 and Buk missile systems, along with military aircraft that Zelensky said would “save millions of Ukrainians, as well as millions of Europeans.” The Ukrainian president said what his country has right now, nearly two months into battle, “is not enough” as “Russia still has the capacity to attack — and not only against Ukraine. Poland, Moldova, Romania and the Baltic states will become the next targets if the freedom of Ukraine falls.” “The images of Bucha and Mariupol have demonstrated real Russians’ intentions to the whole world. It could only be stopped by force of arms. It must be done now. Ukraine needs weapons supplies. We need heavy artillery, armed vehicles, air defense systems and combat aircraft — anything to repel Russian forces and stop their war crimes.” Zelensky concluded his plea by saying that “freedom must be armed better than tyranny. Western countries have everything to make it happen” and that “the number of people saved depends on them. Arm Ukraine now to defend freedom.” On Tuesday, President Biden said Russia’s war against Ukraine amounts to “genocide” — a declaration Zelensky called “true words of a true leader.” “Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil,” Zelensky tweeted. “We are grateful for US assistance provided so far and we urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities.” During his Sunday night address, Zelensky said that this week would be crucial to the war, with Russian troops expected to “move to even larger operations in the east of our state.” As he asks for more weapons to defend the people of Ukraine, Zelensky continues to push for peace with Russia — which has been accused of killing at least 52 people at a train station last Friday in Kramatorsk, where thousands had gathered to try to flee. In March, Sergei Ryabkov, a deputy foreign minister for Russia, said any arms shipments to Ukraine would be targeted. “We warned the United States that pumping weapons into Ukraine from a number of countries as it has orchestrated isn’t just a dangerous move but an action that turns the respective convoys into legitimate targets,” he said. But despite this, the amount of weapons the U.S. is sending to Ukraine is increasing. After speaking to Zelensky on Wednesday, Biden announced he had authorized another $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine that includes artillery and helicopters.",World/Yahoo News,Zelensky releases English-language plea: These are the weapons Ukraine needs,https://news.yahoo.com/zelensky-ukraine-war-plea-weapons-russia-164850618.html
