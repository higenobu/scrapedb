5/13/2022,"HELSINKI (AP) — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday that his country is “not favorable” toward Finland and Sweden joining NATO, indicating that Turkey could use its status as a member of the Western military alliance to veto moves to admit the two countries. “We are following developments concerning Sweden and Finland carefully, but we are not of a favorable opinion,” Erdogan told reporters. The Turkish leader explained his opposition by citing Sweden and other Scandinavian countries’ alleged support for Kurdish militants and others whom Turkey considers to be terrorists. He also accused Greece, a NATO ally, of using the alliance against Turkey, saying Ankara did not want a repeat of that “mistake.” Erdogan did not say outright that he would block any accession attempt the two Nordic nations might make, but NATO takes all its decisions by consensus, meaning that each of the 30 member countries has a potential veto over who can join. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said that Finland and Sweden, should they formally apply to join the world’s biggest security organization, would be welcomed with open arms. The accession procedure could be done in “a couple of weeks,” several NATO officials have said, although it could take around 6 months for member countries to ratify the accession protocol. Meanwhile. a report by the Swedish government on the changed security environment facing the Nordic country after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine says Moscow would react negatively to Sweden joining NATO and launch several counter-measures. The Swedish government’s security policy analysis, which will be used as a basis for Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson’s Cabinet to decide whether to seek membership in the Western military alliance, was presented to Swedish lawmakers Friday. Sweden’s governing Social Democratic Party, led by Andersson, is expected to reveal its decision on Sunday. The report pointed to NATO membership carrying a number of advantages for Sweden - above all the collective security provided by the 30-member military alliance. At the same time, it lists numerous tactics Russia is likely to take in retaliation. These would include cyber and different kind of hybrid attacks, violations of Swedish airspace or territorial sea. Other aggressive behavior including strategic signaling with nuclear weapons are also conceivable from Moscow, the report said. The report states that Russia’s war in Ukraine limits the possibilities for attacks on other countries but that Russia still has the capacity for a limited number of hostile measures against countries like Sweden. The report does not make recommendations whether Sweden should join NATO or not. Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde told lawmakers at the Riksdagen legislature that “an armed attack on Sweden cannot be ruled out” and pointed to the security guarantee that NATO membership would offer. The president and prime minister of Nordic neighbor Finland said Thursday they’re in favor of rapidly applying for NATO membership, paving the country’s way to formally announce membership bid in the coming days. ___ Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey.",World/Associated Press,"Turkey's leader opposes letting Finland, Sweden join NATO",https://news.yahoo.com/leader-says-turkey-opposes-letting-113050168.html
5/13/2022,"Melania Trump was offended Anna Wintour didn't contact her before visiting Donald, a new book says. Amy Odell's ""Anna: The Biography"" claims Melania was annoyed by Wintour's snub and didn't greet her. Wintour backed Hillary Clinton for the 2016 presidency but reached out to Donald after his victory. Melania Trump was offended Anna Wintour didn't inform her she was coming to visit Donald Trump after his 2016 presidential victory so she ignored the magazine editor, a new biography says. In ""Anna: The Biography,"" which was published on May 3, fashion journalist Amy Odell spoke to Melania's then-friend Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who said the former American first lady was ""so offended"" by the snub that she ""didn't even say hello"" when Wintour arrived at Trump Tower. According to Wolkoff, Melania hadn't heard about the visit, which was coordinated shortly after Hillary Clinton's presidential loss to Donald. Wintour had ""begrudgingly reached out"" to her long-term acquaintance Ivanka, Donald's 40-year-old daughter, to arrange the meeting, the book added. ""Melania didn't understand that she had been invited to Anna's events not because she was a friend, but simply because she had appeared on the February 2005 cover of Vogue,"" Odell wrote, referencing Melania's cover story released ahead of her marriage to Donald. Odell added that Wintour's team ""tried twice, once before Trump's inauguration and once after, to photograph Melania for Vogue. But in part since they wouldn't guarantee a cover, Melania wouldn't do it."" Wolkoff, who had been a close friend of Melania since 2003, took on an unpaid role as an advisor to Melania and helped to plan Donald's inauguration in 2016, Insider previously reported. She later wrote a tell-all book, ""Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady,"" in September 2020, in which she said they met while Wolkoff was a director of special events for Vogue. The book led to Wolkoff being sued by the Department of Justice, which claimed it breached a nondisclosure agreement she had signed. The lawsuit was later dropped in February 2021 by the DOJ without giving a reason. According to Wolkoff's book, when Melania was asked to appear in a Vogue profile, she said: ""I don't give a fuck about Vogue or any other magazine. They would never put me on the cover. All these people are so mad."" The book added that Melania claimed people said Vogue was jealous that she still looks good despite many designers refusing to dress her. Odell's biography also claims that Wintour cried in front of Vogue staff the day after Clinton's loss to Trump, after Vogue formally endorsed the first woman to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Odell said that the endorsement was ""the first of its kind in the magazine's 124-year history"" and that Wintour was ""angling"" to secure an ambassadorship to the UK in a Clinton administration that could have ended her tenure at the magazine. The book adds that an advisor to Clinton said that while the politician thought Wintour would make a great ambassador and ""nominating her was a possibility,"" no formal process had been undertaken before Clinton's election loss. Wintour's then-boyfriend, Shelby Bryan, told Odell: ""If she'd been offered the ambassadorship to the UK, I think she would have had to really think hard about that."" While addressing staff the day after Donald's victory, Odell wrote that Wintour defended her choices amid criticism from a WWD article questioning if she went too far in her endorsement of Clinton. According to the book, Wintour told staff: ""I would just like to say to everyone gathered here today, who works for me, that if supporting LGBTQ rights, if supporting women's rights, if supporting women running for office, if supporting immigrants, and if supporting people all over the country for equality means going too far, then I hope all of you go too far every single day."" Representatives for Melania and Wintour did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

5/13/2022,"Ukraine's military claims it destroyed dozens of Russian armored vehicles as they attempted to cross a river in eastern Ukraine. Photos posted on social media by Ukraine's ministry of defense show destroyed pontoon bridges as well as vehicles. Russia has struggled to achieve its objectives in Ukraine and has suffered significant losses. The Ukrainian defense ministry has shared images of the aftermath of a battle that it says left dozens of Russian armored vehicles that had attempted to cross the Siverskyi Donets River in eastern Ukraine by way of pontoon bridges destroyed or disabled. A collection of Ukrainian military photos posted on social media appeared to show not only destroyed pontoon bridges but also damaged or destroyed tanks and other armored vehicles on both sides of the river. Drone images of the battle, which took place over the weekend, show nearly three dozen broken vehicles, according to multiple reports. A tweet from the Ukrainian defense ministry said that the ""artillerymen of the 17th tank brigade of the #UAarmy have opened the holiday season for ruscists,"" adding that ""some bathed in the Siverskyi Donets River, and some were burned by the May sun."" —Defence of Ukraine (@DefenceU) May 11, 2022 In a separate social media post, the Ukrainian military's strategic communications directorate said the army had ""destroyed all attempts by the Russian occupiers to cross"" the river. Russia has struggled to achieve its objectives in Ukraine since it invaded Feb. 24. The Russians have suffered heavy losses, including thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks and aircraft. After its forces were stalled outside Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and ultimately forced to withdraw, Russia had no choice but to change its invasion tactics and focus on Ukraine's eastern region. The Siverskyi Donets River flows through eastern Ukraine, through the regions of Kharkiv and Luhansk, and the waterway has made it difficult for Russia to gain ground in certain areas of strategic importance. Pontoon bridges take time to erect and cross, and these choke points can leave forces vulnerable to attack. The British defense ministry said on Thursday that Russia was moving units to the eastern bank of the Siversky Donets to ""reorganise and replenish its forces following heavy losses."" Once the forces have been replenished, they will likely be used to protect Russia's main forces and supply routes, the ministry said.
