3/17/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -Russia warned the United States on Thursday that Moscow had the might to put the world's pre-eminent superpower in its place and accused the West of stoking a wild Russophobic plot to tear Russia apart. Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, said the United States had stoked ""disgusting"" Russophobia in an attempt to force Russia to its knees. ""It will not work - Russia has the might to put all of our brash enemies in their place,"" Medvedev said. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the United States and its European and Asian allies have slapped sanctions on Russian leaders, companies and businessmen, cutting off Russia from much of the world economy. President Vladimir Putin says that what he calls the special military operation in Ukraine was necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Russia had to defend against the ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people by Ukraine. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. The West says claims it wants to rip Russia apart are fiction. Russia says that despite sanctions it can fare well without what it casts as a deceitful and decadent West led by the United States. It says its bid to forge ties with the West after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union is now over and that it will develop ties with other powers such as China.

Gretta Vedler, 23, went missing a year ago after her anti-Putin social media rant, but the two events do not appear to be connected. ""Vedler's ex-boyfriend Dmitry Korovin, 23, has now confessed to strangling her to death before driving her 300 miles to the Lipetsk region and abandoning the body in the boot of a car.."" the Daily Star reports.

Korovin told authorities that he slept in a hotel room for three nights with her dead body, which was stuffed in a newly bought suitcase. The man then left her body in the trunk for a year but kept posting to her social media pages to make it look like she was still alive.

""I can only assume, in my opinion, clear psychopathy or sociopathy is seen in him.

3/17/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered an unsettling warning to any Russians who might be supportive of the United States and other Western countries. ""Any people, and particularly the Russian people, will always be able to tell apart the patriots from the scum and traitors and spit them out like a fly that accidentally flew into their mouths,"" Putin said during a televised address on Wednesday. ""I am convinced that this natural and necessary self-cleansing of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity, cohesion, and readiness to meet any challenge."" Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, anti-war protesters have been demonstrating in the streets, leading to thousands of arrests. Earlier this week, Marina Ovsyannikova, a producer at the state-run Channel One television station, held up an anti-war sign during a news broadcast. Putin mentioned in his speech the sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries, and said these ""steps are aimed at worsening the lives of millions of people."" Despite foreign countries withdrawing their business from Russia and Moscow's stock market remaining closed, Putin said having to deal with the repercussions is worth it because ""the struggle we are waging is a struggle for our sovereignty, for the future of our country and our children."" Russia's military actions in Ukraine, he declared, ""fully justified themselves."" Putin's speech was ""in part, an informal and indirect sanctioning of mass repression,"" Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the political analysis firm R. Politik, told The New York Times. She said the Russian president was making it clear to law enforcement authorities that ""all spheres of society that show any sympathy to the Western way of life"" should be targeted, and that ""was scary â€” very scary.""
