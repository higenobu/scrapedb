3/16/2022,"More than 100,000 Britons have expressed interest in hosting Ukrainian refugees, amid concerns that the new government scheme could lead to exploitation of vulnerable women and children. The figure was released by the government less than 24 hours after Homes for Ukraine programme was launched to take in those fleeing Russia’s invasion, most of whom are women and children. Under the scheme, UK householders will be given initial “light touch” checks and paid £350 a month if they take in named individuals. Lauren Agnew, human trafficking policy expert at Christian Action, Research and Education, said the scheme is “well motivated” but could lead to exploitation. “With large numbers of applications needing to be processed quickly, red flags could be missed in the vetting of potential hosts. “Recent statistics from the National Crime Agency estimate there are at least 6,000-8,000 modern slavery offenders in the UK. We can be certain that some of this number will be seeing the Homes for Ukraine scheme as an opportunity to turn a profit,” she said. Local authorities will also receive £10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services - with more for children of school age, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said. Local government leaders have warned that the quick turnaround of arrivals could mean that accommodation is unsafe and relationships between sponsors and new arrivals break down. James Jamieson, the chair of The Local Government Association, said: “With new arrivals possibly arriving as early as Sunday, councils are facing a very tight timeframe to make appropriate safety checks on accommodation being offered. “There is a limit to what can be achieved by councils in such a short space … Despite good intentions, there is a risk that some accommodation offered may not meet safety expectations when inspected by councils or sponsorships may break down.” Before the scheme launched, only Ukrainians with family links to the UK could apply for visas that would give them access to work and benefits. But on Monday, the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, announced that sponsors could bring any Ukrainian to the UK to live in their home for a minimum of six months. A Ukrainian family could become the first to be rehoused in Britain after they were offered a place at a six-bedroom mansion in Yorkshire. Lillia and Vitalii Kucher, along with their daughters Victoria, 14, and Ilona, six, have sought accommodation at Sabrina and Tony O’Brien’s home in Driffield near Hull, the Daily Mail reported. They are looking to get to the UK in the next week after fleeing to Moldova when Russia invaded their homeland last month. Almost 3 million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion, with more displaced within the country as cities are shelled. Concerns that Ukrainians fleeing the war are facing exploitation were also raised in the House of Commons on Tuesday by Theresa May. The former prime minister said: “This is happening in Poland. It’s happening in other countries where Ukrainian refugees are fleeing to. “It’s a sad reflection on human nature that the very point where these women and children are fleeing Ukraine for their safety to find refuge elsewhere, the criminal gangs have moved in to make money from the trafficking of what they consider to be yet another commodity, that is human beings, and they are attempting to make money out of this human distress and vulnerability.” The UK has faced criticism over its policy towards those fleeing the violence in Ukraine, with applicants required to apply for a visa. Boris Johnson has defended the scheme, insisting last week the country was “absolutely determined to be as generous as we possibly can be”. The government has previously come under fire for its response to the evacuation of Kabul after the Taliban takeover in August last year. Some 15,000 people were taken out of the Afghan capital but the rushed nature of the evacuation meant thousands of Afghans who had worked with the UK were left behind. The government has been under domestic pressure to do more to prevent migrants crossing the Channel on small boats, putting themselves at risk in the busy shipping lane. Reports claimed that 300 migrants crossed the Channel by boat on Tuesday, according to journalists monitoring activity off the Kent coast.",News/World news,"UK refugee scheme could lead to exploitation of Ukrainians, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/uk-refugee-scheme-could-lead-to-exploitation-of-ukrainians-say-experts
3/16/2022,"British Iranian dual nationals Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori could be freed and allowed to return to London within days under a deal in which the UK agrees to repay a £400m debt and release an Iranian prisoner. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has for months been at her parent’s home in Tehran awaiting news of whether she would have to serve a further one-year sentence in Iran handed down on top of the five years she had already served. Iranian diplomatic sources leaked news of the possible deal on Tuesday saying the UK had agreed to pay the debt, something London would only be doing if it had the agreement of the US to do so. The UK has previously said the debt payment could not be made because of sanctions on Iranian state banks. On Sunday, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was unexpectedly given her British and Iranian passports – a preliminary to her likely release. She has also been summoned to see officials at the ministry of intelligence and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to discuss her future behaviour. Confirmation of the return of her passport was published by Zaghari Ratcliffe’s MP, Tulip Siddiq. A UK government negotiating team is in Tehran. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said discussions were delicate, adding it was best “you should say as little as possible unless and until the thing is actually concluded.” Ashoori, it is understood, has also been told to make preparations for his likely release from Evin jail, Tehran. It is likely they will be flown out of Iran via Oman. One source said: “This is the closest we have come to her release in six years, but I do not expect to see either of them at Heathrow in the next 24 hours.” The deal could yet unravel as it has in the past if there is a last-minute hitch – either over the talks on the Iran nuclear deal in Vienna or if the US insists other detainees are released. The Vienna talks should see a swath of US sanctions lifted on Iranian state bodies and industries, in return for Iran coming back into compliance with the constraints placed on its civil nuclear activities, including uranium enrichment. Russia threw a last minute curve ball at the Vienna talks on 5 March by demanding written guarantees that any Iran-Russian trade unleashed by the lifting of US sanctions must be exempted from the US sanctions imposed on Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, met the Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss Russia’s demands, and appeared to have backed down. He claimed to have received guarantees, but they do not appear to be the broad exemptions Russia has been seeking. He added it was a lie that Russia had ever wanted to delay the nuclear agreement. His remarks led oil prices to fall. Some officials said it is possible the two British-Iranian dual nationals will be released prior to the conclusion of the nuclear deal since the key bilateral Iranian demand of Britain has been the repayment of the £400m debt that has been outstanding since the 1970s. The UK, in court cases and letters to the Ratcliffe family, have acknowledged it owes the debt. Both Ashooori, sentenced to 10 years, and Zaghari-Ratcliffe, have always protested their innocence, with their families claiming they were being used as state hostages, or pawns in Iran’s demand for the repayment of the debt. The deal appears to exclude Morad Tahbaz, a British-American businessman born in Hammersmith, London, who also has Iranian citizenship. A conservationist, Tahbaz was sentenced along with eight others to 10 years in jail in November 2019 for “contacts with the US enemy government”. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has tweeted frequently in support of his innocence, an acknowledgement that he is a British consular case. His family was in contact with both the foreign office and the US State Department on Tuesday, trying to find out if he had been excluded from any prisoner swap. A member of the Tahbaz family said: “I am asking the question ‘Why is it the only British-born UK citizen held hostage in Iran is being left out and abandoned? How is it that the UK is accepting Iran’s rejection of his nationality based on his birth?” She added: “In January 2021 the then foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had previously sought our consent to get a sanctions waiver from the US for payment of the Chieftain tank funds in exchange for release of Ashoori and Zaghari-Ratcliffe whilst Morad would get a partial furlough and then be treated as a USA problem to secure his complete release. Morad in a message from jail refused such a deal and so did the USA since they expected the UK to work as hard for him for his permanent release.” The Tabhaz family say they had closely followed Foreign Office advice not to go public about his plight, but now felt betrayed since they had found out from the media what was happening behind their backs.",News/News,Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori could be free in days,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/15/zaghari-ratcliffe-and-anoosheh-ashoori-could-be-free-in-days
3/16/2022,"Good morning. Talks between Russia and Ukraine have resumed. Russian forces are reported to have taken patients and medical staff of a hospital in Mariupol as hostages, as the conflict enters day 21 and more than three million people have fled the country. State Emergency Service units in some of the hardest-hit flood areas in northern New South Wales had warned in 2020 that the closure of regional offices would reduce their ability to respond to natural disasters. A dozen SES units wrote to the commissioner warning that a restructure “threaten[ed] the continued existence of units … and the future of the service”. Unions warned at the time the measure would cost jobs and hurt services, but the government justified it on the basis it would “reduce back-office costs and focus expenditure where it is needed most”. In the complaint, the SES units said the removal of regional offices had “pushed significant new administrative burdens on to volunteers, frustrating and demoralising dedicated members”. Almost half of all massacres of Aboriginal people were carried out by police and other government forces, according to final findings of the Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project. The report showed that conflict was widespread and most massacres were planned in a deliberate attempt to eradicate Aboriginal people. The final update of the project added a further 113 massacre sites, but many more attempts did not make the map because fewer than six people died. Historians say attempts at the mass killing of Aboriginal people were still being made as recently as 1981, when a mass poisoning killed two and left many in hospital in Alice Springs. Kyiv is facing “a difficult and dangerous moment” amid signs Russia was tightening its grip on the Ukrainian capital after airstrikes on civilian buildings killed at least five people and prompted a 35-hour curfew. The Polish, Czech and Slovenian prime ministers were due to arrive in the embattled city on Tuesday in a symbolic show of European solidarity. Talks between Russia and Ukraine have resumed, Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said, after negotiations had taken a “technical pause” on Monday. There are reports that Russian soldiers have taken medical and patients from a hospital in Mariupol as hostages. And a woman who protested the war during a live news programme on Russian state TV has been fined 30,000 roubles (AU$390) by a Russian court after she was found guilty of flouting protest legislation. Environment groups say the Morrison government plan to remove the need for federal environmental approval for developments in some regions is a “step towards an industry free-for-all” rather than an effort to protect nature. The government announced it would use a little-known law to create regional plans, which could exempt some developments – such as mining or agriculture – from needing federal environmental approval.

Is battling back-to-back disasters distracting us from fighting the climate crisis? Asks Jeff Sparrow. “If we once hoped that real-world manifestations of the climate emergency would, in and of themselves, force world leaders to change, we should quit kidding ourselves.

While The Cook Up is filmed in Sydney, Liaw’s pre-pandemic adventures took him around the globe.

Liaw tells us about the tea tray that got away, as well as the story of two other handy personal belongings. We’ve all seen the setup in the movies. The gates open slowly, a recently released prisoner walks out, looking dazed. But what happens after that? For prisoners without a home or family to go back to life outside can be a lot more precarious and unstable than life on the inside. One new solution to the lack of suitable accommodation is to place them for a few months in a house with a private citizen. That’s the setup in the new SBS three-part documentary Life on the Outside, an Australia-first experiment inspired by a US initiative. As climate change, natural disasters and other environmental concerns loom large over the next federal election, the Greens are hoping to move further from its status as a party of protest to become a third major political party.

3/16/2022,"In White Torture, a book about the horror of solitary confinement in Iranian jails, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe recalled her first night in jail following her arrest at Tehran airport on 3 April 2016. “The first night of detention I did not know where I was,” she explained. “I don’t remember what happened or what I did. I was shocked. I didn’t know why it had happened. No one gave me any explanations. Nobody told me why they were treating me like that, why they took my child away from me or where I was. The interrogation began.” The sense of bewilderment and injustice – and of wanting to interrogate her interrogators – has followed Zaghari-Ratcliffe in each of the 2,172 days that have passed since then; some of it in solitary confinement, often in a state of torment and unbearable psychological stress. Along with her fellow British-Iranian prisoner, a 68-year-old retired businessman Anoosheh Ashoori, that torment might just be about to end. It’s not a given – after six years of twists and turns, nothing can be taken for granted. But the developments on Tuesday were undoubtedly significant. During her ordeal, Zaghari-Ratcliffe felt suicidal , often only brought back from the brink by the campaigns that their extraordinary families have mounted in the UK to keep their names in lights, and expose what they regard as a systematic Iranian practice of cynical state hostage-taking designed to secure political ends. From her description of her first month in a cell in detention at Kerman detention centre, southern Iran, it is easy to understandwhy she felt so desperate. “The area of the quarantine cell was about two by one metres,” she wrote. “Inside the cell was a half-wall with a squash toilet on the floor behind it. Next to it was a sink and a trash can. The room had a fan. There was no natural light. There was a powerful light bulb in the middle of the cell that never went out. “My heart palpitated so hard that when I put my head on the blanket it was as if it would explode. I knew day from night by the light coming in from the sides of the fan blades on the window. At nights I couldn’t sleep and only by the sound of sparrows did I know it was dawn.” After a month of interrogation she was finally allowed to see her daughter. “After the meeting I felt awful. Gabriella had changed. She had teethed. She didn’t recognise me. I didn’t recognise her either when I first saw her. When they came in she was in my father’s arms. I was so weak that I could not stand. She clung to me and didn’t move at all for a few minutes.” She had been told her family had abandoned her as a spy. After a month she was moved from Kerman to Evin prison in Tehran. She had a cellmate and was able to see her mother and daughter once a week, but she never imagined her ordeal would last six years. In February 2017 she wrote a letter to Gabriella, or Gisou as is her Farsi name. “My sweet girl, the sound of your laughter, has been ringing in my ears these past months, becoming one with me. Caressing your hair and listening to your velvety voice have been denied to me for many days become months. As those moments piled up, they have turned into giant black clouds pouring every night and every day like monsoon rain, constantly with no power in me to stop. Did they not hear long nightly whimpers of a mother? – those who issued a guilty verdict and to achieve their ends accused me, reproached me and locked me up in solitary confinement?” But her story gradually became one of more than personal loss. Her husband, Richard, decided to overrule Foreign Office advice and go public about his wife’s arrest. He believed they felt he could not grasp the bigger picture of Middle East politics. Ironically by the end he was an astute reader not just of the British media and diplomacy but of Iranian politics too. He said: ”Instrumentally, who knows what works? But I do know that Nazanin is sitting in her prison cell knowing that people are shouting for her and rooting for her, and that’s profoundly important. So I do know I’m helping her to know she’s not alone.” Ratcliffe made three discoveries; first that her fate was linked to an unpaid £400m debt dating back to a deal to sell 1,500 tanks to the Shah of Iran; second, she was not alone, but part of an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps industry of hostage-taking; and finally that Boris Johnson as foreign secretary only responded to public pressure. It was after his mistake at the foreign affairs select committee where he said she had only been in Tehran to train journalists that Johnson started briefing that he had found a way to pay the debt. The briefing was premature - there was a Whitehall and transatlantic dimension that had not been cleared. In all his dealings with the Foreign Office, it has been the debt and the UK’s reasons for not paying it that officials and ministers have been most reluctant to discuss. On leaving his post, the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt took the bold step of saying British Iranian dual nationals would not be released until the money was paid. Ratcliffe’s lawyers sent repeated lengthy letters setting out how the debt could be paid and not face US sanctions. Ministers simply refused to discuss the issue. If the deal does go through – and there are many pitfalls ahead – it represents a remarkable change. It had only been last Friday that Ratcliffe and his advisers, Redress, had sent a long legal letter to the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, demanding the Foreign Office describe his wife openly as a state hostage, as opposed to a detainee. The 15-page letter complained that the Foreign Office’s handling had allowed her detention to become not merely a bargaining chip to regain the £400m debt, but also collateral in the grand bargain over the terms on which the US would lift sanctions on Iran and return to the deal signed in 2015 limiting Iran’s nuclear programme. But the Foreign Office only tells the families of the hostages so much, and did not reveal a British negotiating team was already on its way to Tehran. Looking at the sequence of events it was unlikely that the UK team would have travelled unless the UK had agreed to pay the debt, even if the conditions were for discussion, as well as its relationship to the completion of the nuclear deal. But to her astonishment on Sunday, the ministry returned her British and Iranian passports, the start of her release process. It was the first time she had seen them since their confiscation in April 2016 The Foreign Office swore her to secrecy. Early on Tuesday a well placed Iranian foreign correspondent revealed the debt had finally been paid. The Foreign Office was concerned by the leak, fearing it showed Iran might be using their possible release as last-minute leverage to secure better terms on the lifting of sanctions in Vienna. The nuclear deal was virtually complete, but some feared dangling the liberation of two high profile British detainees might be a way to extract some final concessions from the British or the Americans. In her letter five years ago to her daughter she wrote: “There will come a day when we will throw away all these bitter and old memories, all that are decayable and only keep the lessons we learned from them. You, I and your father will never succumb to this hurricane of fate. The love we share knows no boundaries and walls. It is our life. There will come a day that we will be able to live fresh all the days of our lives.” Perhaps that day is finally coming.",News/News,Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s six years of bewilderment and injustice,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/15/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffes-six-years-of-bewilderment-and-injustice
3/16/2022,"It is good practice for companies to change their auditors once in a while, and the same principle should probably apply to countries and operators of national lotteries. So yes, one can instinctively welcome the Gambling Commission’s surprise decision to ditch Camelot, which has had the national lottery gig since it was launched 28 years ago. No company should become part of the furniture. What, though, has Czech group Allwyn, the new “preferred applicant”, promised to do differently to Camelot? It’s impossible to tell because the commission, at this stage, insists on cloaking its decision-making process in secrecy. Assurances that the process was “fair, open and robust” don’t count for much unless the outside world can see the methodology. The clincher, we assume, was Allwyn’s idea that it can raise £38bn for good causes over the decade of the next licence which, even allowing for inflation and greater prosperity among punters over the years, would compare favourably against the £45bn-ish that Camelot has managed since 1994. But the £38bn figure is not yet endorsed by the commission, which merely referenced “increased contributions”. Camelot will probably also have promised to up its game in terms of sums raised, as the other bidders will have done. So how did the commission set about judging the credibility of the various boasts? We’re not told. A degree of paranoia on the part of commission is probably forgivable since the contract is lucrative for the holder (Camelot, owned by a Canadian pension fund, has made after-tax profits of £78m in each of the last two years) and legal challenges are possible, and perhaps likely. Even so, it’s hard to think of another piece of semi-public procurement with such minimal levels of disclosure at the point a victor is declared. Allwyn has assembled an impressive cast of business and fundraising grandees, led by 2012 Olympics guru Sir Keith Mills, but the company obviously had to clear higher hurdles to win. The commission should loosen up and remember that lottery players are interested in who’s running the show and why. More transparency needed. Every fresh sanction helps but, let’s be clear, the UK’s ban on exports to Russia of “high-end luxury goods” (precise definition not yet clear) is not a gamechanger. The Department for Business’s last monthly update of the size of UK-Russian trade already contained some small numbers in the grand scheme of UK exports. Total UK exports to Russia in the 12 months to the end of September 2021 amounted to £4.3bn, of which £2.6bn was goods. Cars, the biggest contributor at £386m, will be covered, one assumes, but pharmaceutical products, next in the list, probably won’t be. Either way, a focused hit to trade in the UK’s 26th largest export market, accounting for just 0.7% of total UK exports, is bearable. Similarly, the imposition of an additional 35% tariffs on £900m-worth of imports also needs to be seen in context. Total UK imports of Russian goods in the same 12-month period amounted to £10.8bn. None of which is to play down the effect of tariffs if they are replicated among all G7 countries, especially those with bigger export volumes to Russia. There will be an impact. But, from a strictly UK perspective, asset freezes on oligarchs remain the main event. UK firms with operations in Russia are a different matter and here, commendably, comes another departure. Imperial Brands, the JPS and Gauloises cigarette firm, will seek “an orderly transfer of our business”, which probably translates as giving it away to a local operator who will look after the 1,000 employees. There’s no surprise in that decision since Imperial had already suspended manufacturing and fellow FTSE 100 member British American Tobacco, after a rapid rethink last week, concluded that a full exit was the only credible course. But one hopes, again, that such examples are copied abroad. JTI, the main subsidiary of Japan Tobacco, and US group PMI, which sells Marlboro and other brands outside the US, are still in a halfway house. Both have suspended new investment in Russia and the latter has spoken about “scaling down” manufacturing operations, but those steps don’t match the ones now taken by the UK rivals. The calculation ought to be the same: tobacco duties flow directly to Kremlin coffers, so there’s every reason to leave.",News/Business,It’s time to come clean on why Camelot lost national lottery licence  | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/15/its-time-to-come-clean-on-why-camelot-lost-the-national-lottery-licence
3/16/2022,"My father, Peter Ackers, who has died aged 97, was a civil engineer and an expert in hydraulics. He worked on projects all over the world, involving hydropower, tidal energy, coastal protection, reservoir spillways and other hydraulic structures. Born in the Liverpool suburb of Bootle, he was the son of Mary (nee Jones), a supervisor in a quilt-making factory, and Peter Ackers, a carpenter/joiner in the Mersey docks. He attended Bootle grammar school, where he excelled at physics and mathematics. He studied civil engineering at the City & Guilds College (part of Imperial College), London. The course was compressed into two years because of the second world war, and its scope broadened to include air-frame design, useful for the war effort. He was also an air-raid warden, reporting to a unit behind the Royal Albert Hall, and suffered a near miss when a shell hit the road next to him, breaking the glass in a nearby telephone box. After graduating in 1944, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory and the Bristol Aeroplane Company, where he was involved in designing the Bristol Freighter and Brabazon aircraft. In 1946 he moved into civil engineering, with periods in local government in Preston and Stoke-on-Trent, during which time he obtained an MSc (Eng) from Imperial College. In 1956 he moved to the Hydraulics Research Station (now HR Wallingford), rising to the position of assistant director, and became active in the International Association for Hydraulic Research. In 1972 he started working as a consultant with Binnie & Partners and became a visiting professor at Imperial College. He worked on protection against typhoon wave attack on the sea defences at High Island reservoir, Hong Kong; the design of the Greater Cairo wastewater system; innovative siphon spillways at reservoirs in Hong Kong; a rough-cut unlined rock tunnel to supply water beneath the Andes to Lima; and many other projects. He was also an expert adviser to the committee that investigated the feasibility of a Severn estuary tidal energy scheme, which could have provided 7% of the UK’s electricity generation as “green” and predictable energy. The committee, led by Sir Hermann Bondi, reported to the government in 1981. It was a huge disappointment to him that this project, much larger but similar to the successful tidal energy barrage on the estuary of the Rance river in France, was not taken up. He also wrote or contributed to about 70 technical papers and publications, and retired in 1994. Then he worked on improving his French – he enjoyed travelling, especially on cultural guided tours and river cruises – and raised money for the RNLI. He donated his library of technical books to a university in Ethiopia. In 1949 he married Margaret McGeagh, who was born in Bootle on the same day as him. She died in 2015. He is survived by their three children, Sheila, David and me, by four grandsons and by two great-grandchildren.",News/Technology,Peter Ackers obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/15/peter-ackers-obituary
3/16/2022,"Tony Blair believes that the next fortnight could be the last chance for the west to agree a peace deal with Russia to end the Ukraine invasion before the conflict escalates. The former prime minister said that Nato should not rule out intervening in the war but has also called on the west to not give up on the prospect of negotiating a peace deal with Vladimir Putin. Moscow and Ukraine officials held a further round of talks on Tuesday in an attempt to end the conflict which has entered its 20th day. In a lengthy essay on his thinktank’s website, Blair believes that the next two weeks may be the last chance to agree a negotiated settlement “before the assault on Kyiv becomes worse, the Ukrainian people become hostile to any negotiation, or Putin faces a binary choice between “‘double down’ or retreat”. He wrote: “And we should not underestimate the real economic price the world will pay for continued conflict with steep rises in fuel prices, food prices, global trade and inflation, as ever hitting the poorest in our society the worst ...” The former Labour prime minister also believes that it is a mistake for Nato to be as specific as it has been about not getting involved in the conflict. He argued that the future status of Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine could be part of successfully brokering a peace deal with the Russian president. Blair – who served as prime minister between 1997 and 2007 and took the decision for the UK to join the 2003 Iraq war – said that he understands and accepts there is not any political support for direct military engagement by Nato but the west should be “clear-eyed about what Putin is doing.” He wrote: “He is using our correct desire not to provoke escalation alongside his willingness to escalate as a bargaining chip against us. “When he is threatening Nato, even stoking fears of nuclear conflict, in pursuit of his attempt to topple by force a peaceful nation’s democratically elected president and wage war on its people, there is something incongruous about our repeated reassurance to him that we will not react with force. “I accept the reasoning behind our stance. But suppose he uses chemical weapons or a tactical nuclear weapon, or tries to destroy Kyiv as he did Aleppo in Syria, without any regard to the loss of civilian life – is it sensible to tell him in advance that whatever he does militarily, we will rule out any form of military response? “Maybe that is our position and maybe that is the right position, but continually signalling it, and removing doubt in his mind, is a strange tactic.”",News/World news,Tony Blair: west has fortnight to help end war in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/tony-blair-west-has-fortnight-to-help-end-war-in-ukraine
3/16/2022,"Russian oligarchs will no longer have access to baubles such as the cars, artworks and designer handbags sold by British companies, after the government blocked exports worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Last year, UK firms in total sold £2.6bn worth of goods to Russia, the biggest slice of which was cars, at around £400m, as wealthy Russians splashed out on prestigious marques such as Aston Martin, Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Many luxury goods companies have already voluntarily stopped doing business in Russia but the ban would “make sure oligarchs and other members of the elite are deprived of access to luxury goods”, the government said. Helen Brocklebank, the chief executive of Walpole, the trade body for the UK luxury sector, said it was “fully supportive” of the sanctions. “All of our members have immediately complied with the sanctions imposed and are working to support local employees in any way they can,” she said of its 250 members which include Bentley, Burberry and Rolls-Royce. The clampdown on Kremlin-linked wealth has thrown the spotlight on Britain’s art market amid fears Russian oligarchs could use legal loopholes to evade sanctions. Sotheby’s said it had already stopped the import and export of artefacts to and from Russia and its office in Moscow was currently closed. The company, which does not conduct auctions in Russia, promised to “rigorously follow the sanctions and regulations”. Christie’s, which has also shut its office in Moscow to the public, said it had taken the decision to cancel its Russian art sales which were due to take place this summer in London. Cars are the UK’s number one export to Russia with annual sales of £386m – or nearly 15% of all exports to the country - according to the most recent data from the Department for International Trade. The other big markets are for medicine, machinery and power generators, the data showed. Despite its prominence in the export data, Russia is relatively small market for UK car plants – it is thought that the UK exports fewer than 10,000 cars a year to Russia out of an annual production on 860,000 in 2021. However, there are Aston Martin, Bentley and Rolls-Royce showrooms in Moscow and St Petersburg, as well as dealers stocking cars from BMW-owned Mini. Although overall sales volumes in Russia are low, the expensive cars being sold there have high profit margins, said David Bailey, professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham. The export ban was “another hit” for British carmakers who, he said, are already facing difficulties due to ongoing shortages of semiconductor computer chips. Bailey said British brands such as Range Rover sold well in Russia in part because of the “state of the roads”. It is “partly about the premium and luxury nature of British cars but also their off-road capabilities”, he said. “Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) pulled out basically because they thought was the right thing to do,” said Bailey, who added that the collapse of the rouble would also make it difficult for companies to price expensive cars. “It’s not good news for the likes of Jaguar Land Rover, Bentley and Rolls-Royce.” JLR and Aston Martin have already paused deliveries to Russia. A spokesperson for Bentley Motors said it too had also stopped the export of cars destined for Russia “until further notice”. The scale of spending on luxury goods in Russia is not of the same magnitude as in countries such as China and the US. The annual spend on cars, jewellery and designer fashion is put at about £7bn – a figure split between the domestic market and high-end stores of London and Dubai – by analysts at the investment bank Jefferies. Earlier this month Burberry, one of Britain’s most famous exports, temporarily closed its three outlets in Russia which includes a shop in Moscow’s famous Red Square. The UK government is yet to provide a detailed breakdown of the luxury goods covered by its export ban but analysts think it will be similar to the EU’s, which includes clothing, accessories, precious stones and works of art. It is not clear if Scotch whisky will be on it too; while famously vodka drinkers, Russians are also partial to a malt, with 42m bottles, worth nearly £28m, exported there last year.

3/16/2022,"My colleague and friend Eglé Laufer, who has died aged 96, was a psychoanalyst who worked for more than 50 years at the Brent Centre for Young People (BCYP) in north west London, where she was president. Eglé began providing psychoanalytic therapies to adolescents at BYCP when it was created by her and her husband, Moe (Moses) Laufer, in 1967. She remained completely dedicated to psychoanalysis, and even into her 90s was participating in two weekly clinic meetings at the centre. Over the years Eglé also carried out important research into adolescent breakdown that identified the importance of having dedicated spaces, such as BCYP, to consider teenage development. With Moe she suggested that mental breakdowns among teenagers were often related to a rejection of the adolescent body. She was born in Vienna to Sigrid, an Austrian child psychiatrist, and her husband, Imre Vajda, a Hungarian economist. Her parents divorced in the early 1930s when Eglé was still young, and when her mother married ​Edwin Pribram, an aircraft engineer, she moved to London at the age of seven with her new family. Eglé graduated in mathematics and physics at King’s College London, but then decided to become a psychoanalyst, and did her training at the Institute of Psychoanalysis during the 50s. First she worked with young women in the obstetrics department at University College hospital, and then became a training analyst at the British Psychoanalytical Society. In 1947 she had married Sigurd Zienau, a theoretical physicist, with whom she had a child, Nick. They divorced in 1960, and she married Moe in 1965. Two years later, with a group of psychoanalysts led by Moe, Eglé founded the BYCP to provide free psychotherapy and to focus on adolescent breakdown – at a time when mainstream psychoanalysis was disregarding the treatment of adolescents. Together, Eglé and Moe created Adolescent Exploratory Therapy (AET), a tailored version of traditional psychoanalytic psychotherapy for vulnerable, hard-to-engage young people. With her work at the BCYP, which provided AET for 374 young people last year alone, Eglé and Moe’s reputation spread further afield, and and similar services for adolescents have been created in Geneva, Milan and the US. Moe died in 2006. Eglé is survived by Nick and by four grandchildren, Jenny, Eva, Emilie and Raphael.",News/Society,Eglé Laufer obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/15/egle-laufer-obituary
