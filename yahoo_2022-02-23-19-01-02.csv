2/23/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. faces a wild ride over the next few days, with options pricing pointing to huge swings in the stock as investors brace for a drop in earnings and further regulatory scrutiny.

That would be the second-sharpest earnings reaction for Alibaba since 2015, following an 11% slump on its revenue miss in November. Investor sentiment to Alibaba is becoming increasingly fragile, with Beijing telling the nation’s biggest state-owned firms and banks to start a fresh round of checks on their financial exposure and other links to Ant Group Co., Bloomberg reported Monday. Alibaba owns a third of Ant. A lower profit for the three months through December would be the third straight drop for the company and its longest stretch of declines since 2015, Bloomberg data show. Its U.S.-listed stock is down 64% from its October 2020 peak as Ant Group, in which Alibaba holds a one-third stake, was forced to scrap its initial public offering amid Beijing’s crackdowns on private enterprise. On Wednesday, the firm’s Hong Kong-listed shares advanced 0.9%, snapping three consecutive days of declines. The expected move is based off implied one-day volatility that uses two option market expiries closest to the earnings date. Fresh worries over Beijing’s regulatory plans for the sector saw Chinese technology shares slip for a third straight session on Tuesday. The Hang Seng Tech Index fell 1.9% to the lowest close since its inception in 2020, with Alibaba among the biggest losers.

2/23/2022,"Gold is trading at its highest levels in over a year, with inflation high and commodities volatile amidst Russia’s potential invasion of Ukraine. Spot gold, the price at which gold is being sold at a specific time, hit a high of $1,912 per ounce on Tuesday morning. It is a huge rise from the $1,800 that gold was trading for at the beginning of February, and may be close to surpassing $2,000 per ounce for only the second time in the yellow metal’s history, after having done so in August 2020 for the first time. But despite the rise, one UBS strategist does not believe the surge will last. “We are expecting gold prices to head lower towards the end of this year,” Joni Teves, precious metals strategist at the investment bank, told CBS Tuesday morning from Singapore. “We do think that this strength should ultimately be short-lived.” Teves’ prediction matches a forecast for gold prices in 2022 that UBS issued last October. The Swiss investment bank foresaw gold gradually lowering in price throughout the year, hitting $1,700 per ounce by the end of March, down to $1,650 by June, and rounding out the year at around $1,600. In its initial forecast on gold’s upcoming year, UBS advised “curbing tactical holdings and hedging strategic ones,” but unforeseeable events have dominated the early months of 2022 and reignited an interest in gold. The main driver of higher gold prices has been Vladimir Putin’s threat of a forthcoming invasion of Ukraine. On Tuesday, the Russian president formally recognized two separatist states in eastern Ukraine and ordered troops to move into the regions, an act that world leaders took as a bellwether for a coming military campaign. Russia’s threats have already incurred reactions by the U.S. and western European countries, who have announced a series of sanctions and economic measures to penalize Putin, one of which involves the development of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a planned natural gas link between Russia and western Europe worth $11 billion. The sanctions have spooked investors and sent U.S. stocks rolling. The Nasdaq Composite was down almost 2% Tuesday, while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were down well over 1.5%. In times of market volatility, gold tends to be a safe investment and a desirable asset for investors. During periods of high inflation, like the pandemic-induced one we are living in right now, gold has been seen as a safe bet to guard against rising prices and unpredictable stock markets, as the asset has a history of delivering higher-than-inflation returns. Gold’s traditional status may explain the current surge in trading activity, but gold's rate of growth relative to inflation has slowed in recent years, diminishing its role as a long-term hedge. Teves and UBS predict that a similar trend will play out over the next few months: an intense but brief surge followed by a cooling period as investors quickly turn to other desirable assets. “We do think prices can stay elevated as geopolitical risks linger,” Teves said. “But our expectation is that ultimately, as geopolitical risks fade, the gold market should revert back to focusing on macro drivers such as real rates, Federal Reserve policy, and the growth outlook.” The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by March, the first of what may be several rate hikes to occur this year to counter runaway inflation. Teves believes this will likely put a negative pressure on gold and bring its price down closer to UBS’ forecast.

2/23/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Latin American e-commerce retailer MercadoLibre Inc. grew its revenue more than expected and gained market share in Brazil even as Asian players continue to strengthen their footprint in the company’s largest market. Most Read from Bloomberg Blinken Says Meeting With Lavrov Is Canceled: Ukraine Update Porsches, Lamborghinis Lost at Sea May Cost VW $155 Million U.S. Condemns Russian Move at UN, Reassures Kyiv: Ukraine Update Stocks Decline as Biden Proposes Russia Sanctions: Markets Wrap Leissner Says Lover Blackmailed Him Into Buying $10 Million Home MercadoLibre posted a net revenue of $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, a 61% increase from a year earlier and slightly above analyst estimate of $2 billion, according to a statement Tuesday. The company reported gross merchandise volume of $8 billion, roughly in line with expectations, fueled by growth in Brazil, where firms including Sea Ltd.’s Shopee e-commerce platform have been building up their local operations. “We’ve gained share in Brazil, even with the Asian players,” said Andre Chaves, a senior vice president at the Buenos Aires-based firm, in an interview. “We look at competition carefully and we try to learn, but that shouldn’t change our strategy. Everything in the quarter points to a sustainable growth path.” Despite strong revenues, MercadoLibre posted a net loss per share of 0.92 cents on the dollar, below analyst expectations of gains of 0.73 cents per share. The results reflect that the fourth quarter is a time of year that concentrates high sales volume but also high expenses, such as marketing, discounts and rebates, Chaves said. “We share this with our sellers but we have to put some of the investments ourselves.” Read More: MercadoLibre Is Changing the Way Latin Americans Shop—and Pay The firm’s credit portfolio grew to over $1.7 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.1 billion in the previous three months, while non-performing loans improved at a moment when investors are concerned about potential deterioration in credit quality in Brazil amid rising inflation and rates. The company is managing default risk levels in its credit book “very closely,” Chief Financial Officer Pedro Arnt said in the company’s earnings call. MercadoLibre acquired Brazilian logistics firm Kangu last year and recently announced the purchase of stakes in two crypto firms. Chaves declined to comment on possible merger targets and on how the company may further incorporate crypto functionalities in its back-end or its user-facing products. Shares in MercadoLibre were up 10% in after-market trading. The stock is down 55% since peaking in January of 2021, battered by rising U.S. rates and fears over fierce competition. MercadoLibre has 24 buy-equivalent recommendations from analysts, five holds and no sell, Bloomberg data show. Other key points from the earnings call: MercadoLibre is “encouraged” by the number of Brazilian users transacting with crypto through the company’s digital wallet The company will continue to invest in key areas that are part of its strategy including logistics, category expansion, roll-out of fintech products and credit The advertising business relative to total gross merchandise value has crossed the 1% mark, a milestone for the company It’s a high-margin business and MercadoLibre has seen good progress on that front so far (Updates with CFO comments and stock move starting in sixth paragraph.)
