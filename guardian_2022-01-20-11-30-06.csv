1/20/2022,"Senate Democrats failed again to pass sweeping new voting protections on Wednesday, in what may be the most brutal blow yet to efforts strengthen protections for voters at a perilous moment for US democracy. Just as they have done four other times in recent months, all 50 Republicans united in their opposition to the measure. They relied on the filibuster, a Senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance legislation to a final vote.  Despite heavy pressure from Joe Biden and fellow Democrats, two senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have dug in defending the measure, preventing Democrats from getting rid of it. The measure has failed before, but this time marks a profound setback for Biden’s presidential agenda. The president spent an enormous amount of political capital in recent weeks pressuring Manchin and Sinema to support rule changes to the filibuster, giving a speech in Atlanta and traveling to Capitol Hill to try to get support. Democrats threw out a number of proposals that would have tweaked the filibuster rules, and were set to take a vote on changing the rules as soon as Wednesday evening. But in the end, Manchin and Sinema made it clear they were opposed to it. In a clear rebuke to Biden, Sinema gave a speech on the Senate floor last week making it clear she would not support changes to the filibuster. Manchin has also consistently made his support clear. The bill that failed on Wednesday, Freedom to Vote: John R Lewis Act, combined two major voting rights bills into a single mega bill. It would have set a national baseline for election access, guaranteeing 15 days of early voting as well as online voter registration. It protected local election officials from harassment and partisan interference in their jobs and curbed gerrymandering, the severe distortion of partisan district lines. It also restored a key piece of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required places with a history of voting discrimination to get their changes approved by either the justice department or a federal court in Washington before they go into effect. The bill’s failure comes as states across the US have waged an aggressive effort to restrict voting access after the 2020 election, which saw record turnout. In total, 19 states have passed 34 bills that restrict voting access, making it harder to request and return a mail-in ballot, among other measures, even though there was no evidence of fraud, either in mail-in voting or otherwise, in 2020. Many of those efforts are obviously aimed at Black and other minority voters who helped Democrats win in 2020, activists say. As state legislatures reconvene, Republican lawmakers are proposing even more new restrictions. At the same time, Republicans in state legislatures are redrawing electoral districts at the state legislative and congressional level to virtually guarantee their re-election for the next decade. Seeing Democratic gains in traditionally Republican districts, Republicans have redrawn the lines to simply make many districts uncompetitive for the next decade, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. It’s a strategy that has blunted the growing power of Black, Hispanic and Asian voters in places like the suburbs, which are rapidly diversifying. In North Carolina, for example, Republicans lowered the Black voting age population of a district long represented by GK Butterfield, a former judge who is Black. It will be harder for Black voters in that district to elect their candidate of choice and Butterfield has since announced he is retiring from Congress. There is also growing concern about what experts call election subversion – efforts to inject more partisanship into election administration and counting votes. Republicans are passing laws that give them more partisan control over key administrative roles and Trump allies who have embraced the myth of a stolen election are running for secretary of state in places such as Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada – a perch from which they could exert enormous unilateral control over election rules. Civil rights groups have waged an aggressive campaign, privately and publicly, trying to get Manchin and Sinema to support a filibuster change. “Let’s be honest, every voter suppression bill passed in the 19 states across the country has been passed by Republicans alone. If one party can dismantle our democracy on its own, the other party should muster the courage to safeguard it,” Derrick Johnson, the president and CEO of the NAACP, wrote in a letter to senators.",News/US news,Democrats fail to advance voting rights law as Senate holdouts defend filibuster,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/19/voting-rights-senate-democrats-filibuster
1/20/2022,"A proposal by Scott Morrison to allow children to drive forklifts appears to have caught the states by surprise, with the Queensland, Victorian and NSW governments saying they have no plans to lower the current age of 18. Unions have also criticised the proposal, saying forklifts are dangerous machines that require skilled operation.  Speaking on Wednesday ahead of a meeting of national cabinet on Thursday, Morrison said he wanted to further reduce regulation in the transport and other sectors in order to ease a staffing crisis that has crippled supply chains and stripped supermarket shelves of staples including pork and some fresh vegetables. “There are other changes that need to be made and they’re at a state level, and I’m continuing to pursue those with the states,” Morrison said. “There are changes that we need to make around the age of forklift drivers, to get quite specific.” Forklift drivers in Queensland, NSW and Victoria require a special “high risk work” licence, which involves doing a short course and sitting a test, and is only available to people who are 18 and over. Morrison did not say what age minimum he wanted instead of 18 and a spokesperson for the prime minister did not provide an age when asked. As a former warehouse worker, I am truely baffled by Morrison’s forklift announcement. I’ve know adults who were dangerous behind the wheel of a forkie, let alone young people.Makes me wonder what they’re trying to distract us from, with this ridiculous announcement. A spokesperson for Queensland’s industrial relations minister, Grace Grace, said there had been “no contact” from the prime minister on the idea with either the minister’s office or at the departmental level with the Office of Industrial Relations. “It’s certainly not something Queensland is considering independently,” the spokesperson said. Under the Palaszczuk government, Queensland has taken a hard line on safety at work. In 2017 it became the second state or territory, after the ACT, to introduce industrial manslaughter laws. The first industrial manslaughter conviction under the new law, in 2020, involved a man crushed between a forklift operated by an unlicensed driver, and a stationary truck. Tim Lyons, who conducted the review that resulted in the industrial manslaughter laws, said that “letting kids whizz around on forklifts is insane”. “They are not dodgem cars,” he said in a Twitter post. “The kids are very likely to kill or injure themselves or someone else.” I worked in warehouses at Uni. Had a forklift licence. I organized in warehouses for more than a decade. Letting kids whizz around on forklifts is insane. They are not dodgem cars. The kids are very likely to kill or injure themselves or someone else. pic.twitter.com/bU6ZKwTM8s A spokesperson for NSW’s minister for customer service and digital government, Victor Dominello, said: “at this stage, NSW has no plan to change the current law”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said he was not aware that the proposal to lower the age for forklift licences would be up for discussion at national cabinet. “With no disrespect to the PM or anybody else, I’m always up for new ideas and being creative, but I’ve had two meetings these last two Mondays with supermarket CEOs and they haven’t suggested that,” Andrews said. Premier Daniel Andrews says he’s not aware of reports the PM will propose to lower the age of forklift licenses to ease supply chain issues at national cabinet today. Godfrey Moase, an executive director at the United Workers Union, said he had seen “a couple of fatalities” involving forklifts during his time as a union official. “It’s as dangerous or can be as dangerous as a motor vehicle,” he said. “You’re driving … a piece of heavy equipment that can cause severe trauma injuries to people on impact.” He said the age should not be reduced. “It’s a piece of heavy machinery that needs to be treated with due care and respect,” he said.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison proposal to allow under-18s to drive forklifts catches states by surprise ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/20/scott-morrison-proposal-to-allow-under-18s-to-drive-forklifts-catches-states-by-surprise
