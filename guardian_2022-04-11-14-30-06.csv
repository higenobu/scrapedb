4/11/2022,"Six new alpine species of New Zealand’s most unusual and beloved insect – the wētā – have been discovered, but it is a bittersweet victory, with another piece of research describing the threat global heating poses for their snowy mountain habitat. Wētā belong to the same group of insects as crickets and grasshoppers, and there are between 70 and 100 species of wētā endemic to New Zealand. They are wingless and nocturnal, and some, including the wētāpunga, are among the heaviest insects in the world – comparable to the weight of a sparrow. Forests, grasslands, caves and alpine terrains once crawled with wētā, but their populations have suffered with the introduction of foreign pests and increasing habitat decline due to dairy farming. Sixteen of New Zealand’s wētā species are at risk and the rest are classified as threatened or endangered. Now, global warming is speeding up their decline, particularly for the elusive alpine wētā who live in the mountains – a terrain that is gradually disappearing and becoming more isolated. “We knew that there are wētā up there in the high elevation, but the description of their variation has never been done, because although we knew they were there, they were not getting a lot of observation,” said Steve Trewick, a Massey University ecologist and wētā expert. The alpine wētā are agile (one is nicknamed the Mount Cook flea, despite its much larger size) and have an impressive ability to freeze themselves solid during the harsh winter months before thawing out again in spring. But within the excitement of the “fantastic” discovery comes a grim a realisation: “now we know they are there and can sit back and watch as they go extinct,” Trewick said. “We’re still discovering what we have, and at the same time as we’re discovering that, we know that biodiversity is more threatened than ever before,” he said, adding that alpine habitats were top of the list for destruction. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report found it was now “almost inevitable” that temperatures would rise above 1.5C – the level above which many of the effects of climate breakdown will become irreversible. A paper Trewick helped author, published in the Royal Society, looks at climate change and alpine insects, including the wētā’s cousin, the grasshopper. It shows that global warming is seriously threatening the alpine environment, which will have devastating consequences for biodiversity. “As the planet warms, the alpine zone moves up mountain, so the cold conditions become more and more attenuated for the tops of mountains – and mountains are a finite height.” When those alpine environments shrink, they become isolated from other similar terrain, creating small, isolated, populations of animals, which then become more prone to extinction. While the research is focused on New Zealand biodiversity and terrain, Trewick said it had wider applications, and demonstrated that “no part of the planet is exempt from global climate change”. “All those taxa that are associated with those habitats are going to increasingly feel the pinch over the next 30-50 years – we are talking within human lifetimes.”",News/World news,"Six new wētā species found in New Zealand, as their habitat slowly disappears",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/six-new-weta-species-found-new-zealand-as-their-habitat-slowly-disappears

4/11/2022,"Nearly half of LGBTQ+ psychiatrists have experienced hostility at work because of their identity, according to a survey. The study by representative body the Royal College of Psychiatrists found that 48% of respondents said they had received negative treatment because of their sexuality or gender identity. A total of 2,282 people responded to the survey, 572 of those identifying as LGBTQ+. The amount facing abuse was higher for LGBTQ+ psychiatrists from Black, Asian and other minority backgrounds. The report found 58% saying they had experienced bullying, harassment and microaggressions. Hostile comments or behaviours, also known as microaggressions, were the most common form of hostility. They included derogatory comments about LGBTQ+ people and other minority groups in their presence. Two-fifths reported it to their employers, with one in 10 making a formal complaint. Dr Pavan Joshi, who chairs the college’s rainbow special interest group, said nobody should be bullied because of their identity. “Like racism, LGBTQ+ discrimination can be subtle and disguised,” he said. “Discrimination against LGBTQ+ people will continue unless we each speak up and call it out. “Staying silent emboldens perpetrators. Discrimination in all its forms damages mental health. It has no place in our society including the workplace.” The report has been released a week after the government did a U-turn on including transgender people in a ban on conversion therapy. On Sunday the prime minister’s LGBT adviser, Nick Herbert, said he was “dismayed” by the decision, and called for a royal commission on the policy. The government’s LGBTQ+ adviser Iain Anderson had already resigned after the reversal. It had been understood that a policy to outlaw the practice would include attempts at conversion therapy for transgender people, but the government later said it would only apply to those trying to alter people’s sexuality, rather than their gender identity. The government’s flagship LGBTQ+ conference, Safe to Be Me, has also been cancelled after organisations pulled out and Anderson accused ministers of waging a “woke war”. It had been scheduled to take place in June.",News/World news,"Almost half of LGBTQ+ psychiatrists report hostility at work, finds survey",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/almost-half-of-lgbtq-psychiatrists-report-hostility-at-work-finds-survey
4/11/2022,"On a muggy night in a Taipei park, its concrete pavilion lit by the glow from nearby lampposts, a dozen people spread yoga mats and plastic bags on the floor. The atmosphere is convivial and relaxed as they warm up, taking turns to lead the group through exercises copied from US army basic training videos online. They practise drills, dragging each other as injured deadweights, out of the way of a fictional harm. The scene, inside the charming Da’an Park, is made all the more incongruous by the pavilion’s other visitors: young people on dates or in study groups, a couple practising bachata dancing to tinny Latin music. But there is a seriousness among those here. The group is preparing for, well, anything. Taiwan has been under the threat of invasion for decades, but the ratcheting up of Chinese military missions and government rhetoric in recent years, and last month’s attack on Ukraine by Xi Jinping’s key ally Vladimir Putin, have set nerves on edge. Beijing claims Taiwan as a Chinese province and has sworn to “unify” it, by force if necessary. Those gathered on this night – a mix of men and women of various ages and occupations including market researchers, tour guides, landlords and digital designers – joined the group months ago, but membership has tripled since the Ukraine invasion. They are learning first aid, self-defence and military fitness, but others practise firearms drills with airguns. “It feels like the end of the world,” says 34-year-old Lin. (Few participants opt to give their full names.) “It was just fitness [when we started], but then we added first aid … A lot of people want to learn these skills but don’t have access, so this is a start.” The invasion of Ukraine has provided a powerful lesson for people in Taiwan: that a smaller party can resist, and even fight back against a mightier invading force. Residents who spoke to the Guardian said Taiwan shouldn’t rely on others for its survival, pointing to the lack of international boots on the ground in Ukraine, and early delays in coordinating sanctions and other responses. Before the war, a 2021 survey found public support for better training, longer national service and even conscription of women across demographic and political groups. Anecdotally there is an even greater hunger for civilian defence programs. Existing community groups and courses have reported three- to 10-fold increases in inquiries, and new grassroots initiatives have sprung up across cities. Enoch Wu, the founder of one of the more high-profile and professional civil training courses, says the undercurrent of demand was there for some time, but “the events in Ukraine gave us an opportunity to express that desire more urgently, and drove more people to take immediate action”. Taiwan has spent billions on weapons purchases from the US and has strengthened its international relationships and partnerships. It is reforming its reservist program, and last week the defence minister flagged a return to a full year of conscription for young Taiwanese men and the abolition of a non-military public service alternative that many had sought out as an easier term. Domestic polling found the proposals were welcomed by the community, who also showed an increased willingness to fight in Taiwan’s defence. But Taiwan’s military is no match for China’s, with well-reported issues with its resources and training and troop levels reportedly as low as 60-80%. . Despite this, the government appears resistant to the growing calls for training civilians. Admiral Lee Hsi-ming, the former navy chief and chief of the general staff, is among those who have called for a government-backed territorial defence force. Lee’s proposal, written with Michael Hunzeker, a military expert at George Mason University, suggested Taiwan should develop a force made up of civilians of any age and gender. The force could be deliberately decentralised, trained in small but powerful arms such as javelin missiles and small drones, with hyper-local leadership and access to weapons and first aid caches. “They can conduct guerrilla warfare, hit and run – they can be kinds of logistical force,” Lee tells the Guardian. He acknowledges the proposal would require a dramatic and unlikely shift in the government’s current stance and direction, including changes to gun laws. “The Territorial Defence Force in Ukraine destroyed a lot of tanks and armoured cars,” he says. “It’s time for the leadership to change [its thinking].” Huang Kwei-bo, a professor of diplomacy at the National Chengchi University and former deputy director of the KMT opposition party, doesn’t think a European-style civilian force would work well in Taiwan. “A territorial defence force [TDF], all voluntary and part-time, is not impossible in Taiwan, but if not trained and equipped well, it will become both a branch and a burden for the armed forces,” Huang says. Both Admiral Lee and the creators of, and participants in, existing civil groups stress they are not just about preparing for war. Taiwan is a land of frequent disasters, both natural and manmade. A year ago this week, 49 people were killed and more than 200 injured in a horrific train derailment in Hualien. Unable to access crushed carriages, first responders were luckily able to rely on communication with some uninjured passengers who had trained or served with the military and fire departments. People like Enoch Wu want to broaden these skills out to everyone. But the government, which recently drew up a civilian defence handbook instructing people on evacuation routes, does not appear supportive yet of any level of civilian combat force. The defence minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, has fended off calls from fellow legislators, saying he was unaware of desires for a “citizen army” and needed more time to examine it. He told reporters last week the existing system of reservists and armed forces was the priority. “If you want to be included in the training, you need to join the whole process, not just two days,” he was quoted by local media as saying. Not everyone who wants more training believes in a formalised citizens’ army. One of the Da’an Park group’s organisers, Tân Lê-i, is adamant that the benefit of their program is its volunteerism, and any government involvement – even support – would diminish it. “The spirit of our program is autonomy. People need free will to realise what they want to achieve,” Tân says. Some other members say they would relish weapons and tactical training. Chen, a middle-aged woman in North Face activewear, is sweaty and laughing after the drills but sombre when asked about her reasons for being here. She spent a decade as a carer for family members and knows being healthy and safe is not guaranteed. “My job was dealing with life and death, and I understood how things can change in a short time,” she says. Chen joined the group several months ago and felt vindicated after Russia’s invasion, when she saw videos of older Ukrainians “saying if they hold a weapon it lessens the burden on young people”. “Maybe one day I can use this – the preparation isn’t perfect but you have to prepare.” Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin",News/World news,‘It feels like the end of the world’: Taiwan civilians practise for war as Ukraine revives China fears,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/it-feels-like-the-end-of-the-world-taiwan-civilians-practise-for-war-as-ukraine-revives-china-fears
4/11/2022,"Homebuyers wanting to take out a mortgage could soon struggle to get the size of loan they need, as banks begin taking into account the cost of living crisis when calculating how much they can lend. Mortgage brokers have said soaring energy bills, the national insurance rise and a big increase in the cost of household goods are set to prompt banks to tighten their mortgage affordability tests, making it harder for consumers to borrow as much as previously. Santander is now updating its affordability models as households experience a surge in the cost of living. Mortgage brokers told the Guardian that they expect the other big lenders – HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and NatWest – to follow suit. Any significant reduction in the size of loan offered would be expected to slow the property market, as buyers would be forced to downgrade their ambitions. Since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, mortgage applicants have had to undergo strict affordability checks. Borrowers typically have to fill in long documents in which they state all their significant outgoings, including monthly expenses on childcare, car repayments and even how much they spend on the gym. Ray Boulger, a senior analyst at the broker John Charcol, said: ‘This is arguably the biggest tightening in mortgage lending since 2009 because interest rates are increasing, and we are experiencing the largest rise in the cost of living since the 1980s. The difference between now and back then is that banks had a huge shortage of funds then, whereas now the banks are looking at what their customers can afford.” David Hollingworth, a director at Bath-based mortgage brokers, L&C, said: “As customers face soaring energy bills and big hikes in other household costs, it is inevitable that lenders have to start factoring this when calculating how much to lend to a customer. It comes at a time when mortgage rates have pretty much doubled in just over six months, albeit that they are still at historically low levels.” Many banks rely on household spending figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to judge a borrower’s spending – even if an applicant’s actual monthly outgoings are lower – to see if borrowers can afford their monthly mortgage after bills and expenses. However, this ONS data will soon include higher energy costs, with the result that some people might not be allowed to borrow as much in the coming months. Santander told mortgage brokers last week it was updating its affordability test to reflect the latest ONS data. It will also take into account – albeit to a lesser extent – the increase in national insurance contributions and various tax rates. Banks have already begun to implement more stringent “stress tests” on lending as interest rates increase. These are designed to check if borrowers can afford a standard variable rate plus 3%. Tougher affordability checks and heightened stress tests could hit house prices. Halifax said the average house price hit a record £282,753 in March, a tenth higher than the previous year, marking the biggest annual jump since the financial crisis. Russell Galley, a managing director of Halifax, said: “Buyers are dealing with the prospect of higher interest rates and a higher cost of living. With affordability metrics already extremely stretched, these factors should lead to a slowdown in house price inflation over the next year.” Boulger said he expected prices to cool somewhat as consumers reassess their finances. “I expect prices to remain flat by the third quarter of the year,” he said. Hollingworth echoed this sentiment and said one of the biggest drivers in price growth in recent months was the lack of supply, a factor that would “likely remain for some time”. This is certainly the story in London right now, where analysts say rising demand has bumped against a shortage of properties for sale. In the first quarter of this year, London house prices grew at 7.4%, up from 4.8% in the same period last year, according to Nationwide.",News/Business,Homebuyers could struggle with mortgages as UK banks tighten affordability tests,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/11/homebuyers-could-struggle-with-mortgages-as-uk-banks-tighten-affordability-tests
4/11/2022,"The UK has nearly a million graduate-level jobs without qualified staff filling them, according to a report for universities that predicts the labour market’s appetite for graduates will remain strong in the near future. Using data from official sources, the report published by Universities UK found there were 15 million people with degrees or equivalent qualifications working in the UK at the end of 2020 – and nearly 16 million positions in managerial and professional occupations defined as graduate-level jobs. The figures are supported by data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which show that while 14% of the UK’s workforce are overqualified for their current jobs – including graduates working in non-graduate occupations – more than 27% are classed as “underqualified”, including non-graduates filling graduate-level roles. The UUK report is an attempt to rebut misconceptions about graduate employment, such as that undergraduate degrees can be poor value or that too many graduates are unable to find skilled employment. But demand for graduates remained high during the Covid pandemic, according to the Institute for Student Employers. It says the number of graduate vacancies is now 20% higher than before the pandemic in 2019. Job vacancies for graduates are expected to increase again this year compared with 2021. Prof Steve West, UUK’s president and the vice-chancellor of UWE-Bristol, said: “Despite some questioning the value of graduate skills, this report shows that employer demand for UK graduates is significant – it has increased year on year and is likely to grow in the future. “It is important that the UK government develops the right conditions for universities to fully support business growth and skills development for learners of all ages. To be clear, this means that the UK government must invest in a sustainable long-term funding solution for higher education.” Michelle Donelan, the higher education minister for England, said the figures “show just how important higher education and skills are for the UK’s future”. Donelan said the government was “taking forward the biggest reforms to post-18 education in a decade” in England. “We aim to further improve graduate outcomes and continue to drive up quality to deliver the highest-quality education for students from all walks of life,” she said. The government’s recent proposals include increasing the cost of undergraduate student loans for students in England, so that lower and middle income earners are likely to have to find £30,000 more to repay their loans from next year. The government is also consulting on the introduction of minimum GCSE grades required to qualify for student loans, which critics say would largely stop some school-leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds going on to higher education. The UUK report shows that the number of UK workers in professional occupations rose by 647,200 in 2020, while those in other roles fell by 817,000 during the first year of the pandemic. Stephen Isherwood, the chief executive of the Institute of Student Employers, said: “In both the short and long term the demand for skilled graduates is only going to increase. To ensure that employers can access the talent they require right across the UK economy, it is imperative that we continue to invest in graduate talent.”",News/Education,"UK graduate jobs outnumbered graduates by 1m in 2020, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/11/uk-graduate-jobs-outnumbered-graduates-by-1m-in-2020-study-shows
4/11/2022,"Pensioners and benefits claimants will see the value of their payments fall to the lowest point in 50 years on Monday, anti-poverty campaigners have said, as Britons grapple with the worst cost of living crisis since 1972. Despite everyday prices rising as much as 8%, and gas and electricity bills almost doubling to £2,000 a year, the state pension and most other state benefits will rise by 3.1% on Monday. Charities, Labour and others have called on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to do more to help those on middle and low incomes get through the crisis. So far ministers have resisted calls to restore the £20-a-week uplift to universal credit that was introduced during the pandemic but then removed just as prices started rising dramatically last autumn. The money-saving expert Martin Lewis said on Sunday that the UK could experience “civil unrest” later this year if the government fails to take decisive action. Ministers announced in November that the state pension, universal credit and a host of other benefits would rise by 3.1%. The figure was calculated according to the consumer price index (CPI) for the year up to September 2021. The increase means that the basic state pension will rise by £4.25 to £141.85 per week, while the full new state pension will rise by £5.55 to £185.15. A single person aged 25 will see their universal credit allowance rise from £324.84 to £334.91 per month, totalling £4,019 a year. Child benefit rises 68p per week for the eldest child. However, since September the price of most essentials has rocketed. According to the latest UK economic outlook report from PwC, British households are set to be £900 worse off this year in a “historic fall” in living standards. It found that inflation will hit 8.4% later this year. Helen Barnard, the associate director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty group, told Sky News that pensioners and benefits claimants had seen the value of payments fall in real terms in eight out of the last 10 years. “It means that in terms of their values, how much bread and milk you can buy in the shops, it is the biggest fall in value since 1972.” She added: “We know the majority of people in poverty now are in working households. One of the problems is that too many jobs are not just low paid, but they’re insecure – you don’t know what money you’re getting one week to the next, you don’t get sick pay; you don’t get protection if something goes wrong. People are struggling to afford the basic essentials and having to rely on charities for toothpaste and toilet rolls. It’s humiliating for a lot of people.” Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said Sunak had imposed the deepest real-terms cut to the state pension in 50 years and a second deep cut to universal credit in six months. “These severe real term cuts are a direct consequence of his point-blank refusal to take into account current price rises in setting rates,” he said. “His decision will help push an extra 1.3 million people including 500,000 children into absolute poverty. It’s now clearer than ever that the working people, disabled people and pensioners are worse off under the Tories.” A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we’re providing support worth £22bn across the next financial year and, as was approved by parliament, benefits are being uprated by the usual measure, September’s inflation figure. “Our package of support includes putting an average of £1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families via changes to universal credit, cutting fuel duty and helping households with their energy bills. We have also boosted the minimum wage by more than £1,000 a year for full-time workers and are raising national insurance thresholds so people keep more of what they earn.”",News/Business,Cost of living crisis: UK benefits plunge to lowest value in 50 years ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/11/cost-of-living-crisis-uk-benefits-plunge-to-lowest-value-in-50-years
4/11/2022,"A federal judge has indicated that an attempt to stop the far-right Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene running for re-election will be allowed to proceed. The challenge from a group of Georgia voters says Greene should be disqualified under the 14th amendment to the US constitution, because she supported insurrectionists who attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. A similar challenge in North Carolina, against Madison Cawthorn, another prominent supporter of Donald Trump, was blocked. But on Friday Amy Totenberg, a federal judge in Georgia, said she had “significant questions and concerns” about the ruling in the Cawthorn case, CNN reported. Totenberg said she was likely to rule on Greene’s attempt to have her case dismissed on Monday, two days before a scheduled hearing before a state judge. The 14th amendment was passed by Congress in 1866, a year after the end of the civil war, and ratified in 1868. It says: “No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” Congress can reverse any such prohibition. In March, the challenge to Cawthorn was shut down by a Trump-appointed judge with reference to a civil war amnesty law passed by Congress in 1872. According to CNN, Totenberg said she thought that law was retroactive and not meant to apply to future insurrectionists. A bipartisan Senate committee connected seven deaths to the Capitol riot, in which Trump supporters sought to stop certification of Joe Biden’s election victory. Greene has been widely linked to events on January 6. In one example, an organiser of pro-Trump events in Washington that day told Rolling Stone Greene was among a group of far-right Republicans who coordinated with protesters. “I remember Marjorie Taylor Greene specifically,” the anonymous source said. “I remember talking to probably close to a dozen other members at one point or another or their staffs.” A spokesperson for Greene said she and her staff “were focused on the congressional election objection on the House floor and had nothing to do with planning of any protest”. In the immediate aftermath of the storming of Congress, in the last legalistic gasp of Trump’s attempt to stay in power, 147 Republicans voted to object to results in key states. Greene has said she does not encourage violence. Her attorney in the Georgia case is James Bopp Jr, who cited the 1872 amnesty law in his successful attempt to have the Cawthorn challenge dismissed. Like the challenge to Cawthorn, the challenge to Greene is backed by Free Speech for People, a group which seeks election and campaign finance reform. Responding to the Cawthorn dismissal, Ron Fein, legal director of Free Speech for the People, told the New York Times: “According to this court ruling, the 1872 amnesty law, by a trick of wording – although no one noticed it at the time, or in the 150 years since – completely undermined Congress’s careful decision to write the insurrectionist disqualification clause to apply to future insurrections. “This is patently absurd.” In January, Fein told the Guardian his group aimed to set “a line that says that just as the framers of the 14th amendment wrote and intended, you can’t take an oath to support the constitution and then facilitate an insurrection against the United States while expecting to pursue public office”. He added: “The insurrection threatened our country’s entire democratic system and putting insurrectionists from any state into the halls of Congress threatens the entire country.” Writing for the Guardian, the Princeton academic Jan-Werner Muller said: “Whether a heavily right-leaning US supreme court will uphold disqualifications is a very open question indeed – but there is every reason to try enforcing them.”   ",News/US news,Marjorie Taylor Greene: judge mulls move to bar Republican from Congress,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/11/marjorie-taylor-greene-judge-ruling-far-right-republican-reelection
4/11/2022,"The number of GPs in England has fallen every year since the government first pledged to increase the family doctor workforce by 5,000, a minister has admitted. There were 29,364 full-time-equivalent GPs in post in September 2015, when the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, first promised to increase the total by 5,000 by 2020. However, by September 2020 the number of family doctors had dropped to 27,939, a fall of 1,425, the health minister Maria Caulfield disclosed in a parliamentary answer. And it has fallen even further since then, to 27,920, she confirmed, citing NHS workforce data. In the 2019 general election campaign, Boris Johnson replaced Hunt’s pledge with a new commitment to increase the number of GPs in England by 6,000 by 2024. However, Sajid Javid, the health secretary, admitted last November that this pledge was unlikely to be met because so many family doctors were retiring early. Organisations representing GPs say their heavy workloads, rising expectations among patients, excess bureaucracy, a lack of other health professionals working alongside them in surgeries, and concern that overwork may lead to them making mistakes are prompting experienced family doctors to quit in order to improve their mental health and work-life balance. The British Medical Association (BMA) said the figures Caulfield cited showed that the lack of doctors in general practice was “going from bad to worse for both GPs and patients”, and it warned that patients were paying the price in the form of long waits for an appointment. “Despite repeated pledges from government to boost the workforce by thousands, it’s going completely the wrong way,” said Dr Kieran Sharrock, the deputy chair of the BMA’s GP committee. “As numbers fall, remaining GPs are forced to stretch themselves even more thinly, and this of course impacts access for patients and the safety of care provided.” Dr Dan Poulter, the Conservative MP who tabled the question, said: “These figures are hugely worrying because they show that GP numbers in England have been falling, despite ministerial pledges to increase them. “GPs’ relentless workloads are clearly a major factor here. Patients and the entire NHS desperately need more family doctors, in order to reduce waiting times and ensure people who are ill get care, and referral on to hospital if needed, as soon as possible.” Although record numbers of young doctors are choosing to train as GPs, the persistently high rate of early retirement means moves to increase the workforce are faltering. Hunt has cited that as the key reason his pledge of 5,000 more family doctors was not fulfilled. Poulter, a former health minister who works part-time as a psychiatrist in the NHS, urged the government to push through changes to help ease the pressure on GPs. “As an immediate step, the pension penalties that see many GPs, hospital doctors and other healthcare professionals penalised simply for working should be scrapped to avoid many deciding that early retirement is the best option. “In addition, as has been done successfully in Australia, incentives and relocation support packages need to be put in place to attract GPs to work in parts of the country where there are acute shortages.” Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the Covid pandemic had exacerbated the existing “intense workloads and workforce pressures” that GPs face. “GPs and our teams make the vast majority of NHS patient contacts, in turn alleviating pressures across the health service. But with the service buckling under staffing and resource pressures, workload is unsustainable, and this is leading to GPs burning out and leaving the profession earlier than planned,” he said. “Good progress is being made recruiting more doctors into general practice but, if more GPs are leaving the profession than entering it, we’re fighting a losing battle.” Marshall urged Javid to deliver as soon as possible on a separate government pledge to increase the number of pharmacists, physiotherapists, mental health therapists and other health professionals working in GP practices by 26,000 by 2024. Sharrock said the growing population and workforce shortages meant that each GP in England was responsible for 300 (15%) more patients than they were in 2015. The Department of Health and Social Care said Caulfield’s figures only related to fully qualified GPs, and that once trainees were included there were 1,672 more full-time-equivalent family doctors in December 2021 than December 2019. A spokesperson said: “We are committed to growing the general practice workforce to ensure everyone receives the care they need and there has been an increase of more than 1,600 doctors in general practice over the past two years. “To boost recruitment, we have increased the number of GP training places and in 2021/22 we saw the highest ever number of doctors accepting a place on GP training – a record-breaking 4,000 trainees, up from 2,671 in 2014.”",News/Society,GP numbers in England down every year since 2015 pledge to raise them,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/11/gp-numbers-in-england-down-every-year-since-2015-pledge-to-raise-them
4/11/2022,"This Saturday there will be the first full moon of northern spring. According to the Old Farmer’s Almanac, the traditional name for the April moon is the “pink moon”. It derives from the fact that at this time of year in eastern North America, the Phlox subulata wild flower comes into bloom, spreading carpets of pink flowers across the ground. Many other names are also known, based on what Indigenous inhabitants traditionally observe in April. For example, to the Algonquin people of Canada, who live along the Ottawa River, it is known as “breaking ice moon”. This year, the pink full moon is also the Paschal full moon. The word derives from Pascha, which in Greek and Latin means Passover. This is the time of year that Christians believe Jesus was crucified and so the Paschal moon is used to fix the date of Easter, which occurs on the following Sunday. The Paschal moon itself is defined as the first full moon after the spring equinox, which can take place any time between 19 and 21 March. To keep things simple, however, the Church defines “ecclesiastical equinox” as 21 March, so the Paschal full moon is alway the first full moon after 21 March.",News/Science,Starwatch: April pink moon to coincide with Passover moon,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/11/starwatch-april-pink-moon-to-coincide-with-passover-moon
4/11/2022,"Women and children living in some of the hardest-to-reach camps in north-west Syria face chronic and high levels of violence and depression, with some women forced to engage in “survival sex”, a new report has revealed. Children in so-called “widow camps” have been found to be severely neglected, abused and forced to work while mothers are at “breaking point” psychologically. More than 80% of women say they do not have adequate healthcare and 95% expressed feelings of hopelessness. About 34% of children said that they have experienced one or more forms of violence and 2% said they married young. Child labour is a big problem with 58% of boys and 49% of girls aged 11 or older forced to work. Of the 419 people interviewed by the NGO World Vision in 28 camps, home to tens of thousands of single women – including those who are divorced or whose husbands are missing – and their children, approximately one in four women said they had witnessed sexual abuse in the camp on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. About 9% of respondents said they themselves had been sexually abused. Women are not allowed to freely leave the camps, said the NGO. Unable to seek paid employment or support their families, some find they have “no choice” but to engage in so-called survival sex with male guards and camp managers. Alexandra Matei, a lead author of the report, said: “We are seeing the world, rightly, express solidarity with the victims of the conflict in Ukraine and governments generously committed to do whatever it takes to meet the humanitarian needs there. But Syrian widows and their children deserve the same level of empathy, compassion and commitment. Their pain, their desperation, their need is no less than anyone else who is fleeing conflict.” Fatima (not her real name), a mother of three in one of the camps, suffers from severe back pain but is unable to access healthcare. “We do not even have bread and water,” she said. “When [children] ask for bananas, I ask them to be patient. There is nothing we can do. Water and bread are more important.” She said it was not safe for women and girls to go to the mountain to fetch wood to heat themselves or cook. “It is not safe at all. I have to take my neighbour or anyone with me just to not go alone. I cannot send my children on their own either, because it is not safe. I do not have anyone.” Nearly 7 million Syrians have been displaced internally since conflict erupted in 2011. About 2.8 million are living in an estimated 1,300 camps for internally displaced people in the north-west of the country. Widow camps in Idlib and Aleppo are managed by the Syrian opposition and the Turkish military. Conditions there are deemed “drastically” worse than in general camps. There is little or no delivery of essential services for residents, who are experiencing what aid workers have described as “a shocking crisis within a crisis” and “the worst of the worst’’ protection challenges. Access has been restricted to local NGOs. World Vision’s report comes before the government pledging conference on Syria in Brussels in May. Funding has dropped to its lowest level since 2015 due to what the report said was “donor fatigue and Covid-19”. Less than half of the Syria humanitarian response plan was met last year. More than 14 million Syrians were in need of some form of aid as of last month, according to the UN.",News/Global development,"Women face chronic violence in Syria’s ‘widow camps’, report warns ",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/11/women-forced-into-survival-sex-in-syria-widow-camps
4/11/2022,"You think you may have Covid, but after taking a RAT, you find that you are still negative despite exhibiting symptoms. What is going on? The good news is that you are not alone; many people have been reporting dubious test results. The bad news, well … you may actually have Covid.Prof Alexandra Martiniuk is an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney. She has been receiving countless questions about RATs as cases soar and people scramble to keep their families safe. RATs have a much lower accuracy than PCR tests, but are still vital detection tools thanks to their accessibility. “Most are probably around a 75% sensitivity,” said Dr Michael Lydeamore, an infectious disease modeller at Monash University. “Meaning if you have Covid … you have a 75% chance of testing positive. Compare that to PCRs, which are about 99%. So there’s a big gap there.” He says that the lower sensitivity of the tests isn’t too much to worry about as we enter a new stage of the pandemic, where missing some cases a day will not affect overall health outcomes too drastically. By avoiding some common mistakes and following some important tips, you can get the best out of your RATs. There are many different tests on the market, but not all RATs are created equal.Martiniuk recommends only using approved tests sold in Australia, as they will have been assessed by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). Different brands of RATs have different levels of accuracy. The TGA has a list of all of the approved tests sold in Australia, rated in terms of their sensitivity. A good way to ensure your tests are accurate is by checking the list. Currently, the TGA supports three types of tests: nasal swabs, saliva and oral fluid. Dr Martiniuk says that there is no “clear-cut pattern” of which test is most effective. She suggests focusing on brand name when looking for the best test. Most of the tests with a “very high sensitivity” rating tend to be nasal swabs, but some saliva tests also have high rankings. RATs come in different forms, with some being administered through the nostrils and others through the mouth. Martiniuk says one of the most common mistakes people make is not reading the instructions carefully. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Make sure to read the fine print. Most tests provide detailed instructions, including the number of swabs, the method of swabbing (some ask you to spin the swab) and where to take the sample (mouth, nostril, throat). For nasal samples, low and slow is the motto. If unsure, some pharmacies provide supervised RATs. Also make sure your RATs are kept in a cool dry place. If you have symptoms, or have been a close contact, the best thing to do is test again. Doing multiple tests will increase your chances of getting a correct result. The incubation period for Omicron is about two to four days, so doing a test on the day of contact may result in a negative test despite infection occurring.Martiniuk urges everyone to remember to report their positive RATs online or by phone. This helps keep track of the case numbers, but more importantly connects you to health services. Lydeamore’s advice was straightforward. “If you have a negative RAT and have symptoms, and you truly think that it’s a false negative, then my recommendation would be to go and get a PCR.” No test is required to leave isolation in all states except for SA and WA. However, a mask should be worn around other people and high-risk places such as aged care facilities and hospitals should be avoided for at least the next three days. In WA and SA a negative RAT on the seventh day or a negative PCR on the sixth day are required to leave isolation. Regardless where you are, if you still have symptoms after seven days, it is best to remain in isolation until at least 24 hours after your symptoms have resolved. Martiniuk recommends telling people who you spent time with from the two days before you started having symptoms or the two days before you tested positive (whichever came first) that you have Covid.After your Covid infection and your seven-day isolation you don’t need to test or self-isolate for the following 12 weeks. If you are due for a vaccine, the recommendation is to wait about four to six weeks to give your body a chance to recover.",News/World news,Negative RAT but still have Covid symptoms?

4/11/2022,"A 28-year-old Dane is battling storms, snow, and waves several metres high in an attempt to become the first person to make his way around his home country on a stand-up paddleboard (Sup). Casper “The Viking” Steinfath, a six-time Sup world champion, set off from his home beach in Klitmøller – known as Cold Hawaii – on 2 April with nothing more than a tent, a sleeping bag, a cooking set and some meal packages. He plans to camp inland each night and rely on the kindness of strangers to help him get through the 870-mile (1,400km) journey around Denmark’s jagged coastline in some of the worst weather Danes have encountered all year. “Growing up by the North Sea in Jutland, I’m used to playing in any type of conditions,” Steinfath said. “But yesterday was pretty horrendous … I’m currently sunburned, windburned and I have frozen fingers. It’s a weird combination.” He said his strategy for coping was “chapstick, SPF 40 and dancing to Rage Against the Machine every 45 minutes to stop my feet going numb.” Steinfath was inspired to take on the challenge while grounded during the pandemic. “Before corona, I spent 10 years travelling the world for watersports competitions and was away for at least nine months of every year, so the pandemic is the longest period I’ve spent at home since I was a child.” After a brief “rest”, he said, he became curious about Denmark and the Danes. “I dreamed of rediscovering my back yard and the hidden gems of it I haven’t seen yet.” He was most looking forward to seeing South Funen, or the Danish Caribbean as it is optimistically known, and Møns Klint, the 70m-year-old chalk cliffs crumbling into the Baltic Sea two hours south of Copenhagen. Would-be Vikings can follow the progress of what’s being called The Great Danish Paddle via a live GPS map or via @cj_steinfath on Instagram, and then join Steinfath to sail, row or paddle along with him. “I loved watching Forrest Gump as a kid and the scene with the running really stuck with me,” Steinfath said, recalling the 1994 film in which the title character is joined on a cross-country run by others who see him as a guru. Steinfath’s hopes are more humble. “I don’t mind if one person, 10 people or 100 people join me, I’ll just be stoked with any company. Danes come out of their winter caves in spring and there’s a real energy in the air, so it’s a great time to see Denmark.” He aims to paddle about 25 miles a day, carrying 30kg of equipment on his board. On a calm day this means paddling for six or seven hours and taking on in the region of 6,000 calories. “I’m about to eat my second lunch,” he said. While Steinfath was looking forward to the rest of the trip, he was also nervous. “Denmark seems tiny on a map, but there’s a long way to go to get around it on a Sup.” The Great Danish Paddle is expected take between 40 and 50 days. “But who knows, with the Danish weather,” Steinfath said. “There is one immovable deadline on the horizon: ‘I’m getting married in August so I have to be on dry land by then.”",News/World news,"Snow, sunburn and second lunches: Danish paddleboarder’s 870-mile odyssey",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/danish-paddleboarder-870-mile-journey-coast-casper-steinfath
4/11/2022,"Surrounded by a scrum of reporters with a backdrop of bombed-out apartment buildings and rubble in Borodianka, a town in the Kyiv region, stood Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor general. Venediktova is carrying the weight of bringing almost 2,000 cases of war crimes committed by Russia’s occupying forces to court at home and abroad. Her office is the only body in Ukraine with the power to investigate. It is through her office that information relating to war crimes is being collected, investigations will be conducted and domestic and international cases will be built. Reminiscent of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s trip to newly liberated territories outside Kyiv, Venediktova walked around Borodianka with her subordinates observing the damage, wearing an army flak jacket and baseball cap. “I watched while the bodies were exhumed in Bucha,” Venediktova, who was appointed in 2019, said, describing one of the mass graves in the neighbouring town of Bucha, which is being investigated as a war crime. Investigating war crimes is difficult. It involves teams of different experts who can collect and analyse physical, oral and open-source evidence that will stand up against the defence. International criminal law prosecutes individuals, not states, and so prosecutors must link the crime to the perpetrator. “Before the war, the majority of Ukrainians did not trust the state,” said Venediktova. “There were grounds for this: the other general prosecutors and the way they behaved.” The office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general has been dogged by accusations of corruption and inefficiency since the country declared independence. There have been almost no successful major prosecutions over the last 30 years, with the shooting of dozens of protesters in February 2014 in central Kyiv, the murder of two prominent Ukrainian journalists, the poisoning of Ukraine’s third president, and countless instances of state corruption and bribery all failing to result in convictions. Ukrainian NGOs, state workers and civilians involved in gathering evidence to build the cases hope that things will be different this time because of how the war has penetrated the entire society. But doubts remain over whether the war will change Ukraine’s infamously murky judicial system by itself or whether civil society will need to exert pressure. “Some people think it’s going to be the same story with these [war crime] cases. I have my doubts too,” said Svitlana Shevchenko, the head of the Kyiv region administrative courts, on a trip to Borodianka. “But I don’t even want to think about it.” On the second day of the war, legal professionals, the Kyiv region judges and court employees created a Telegram chat where they started to upload videos of alleged war crimes from across the area, being sure to preserve the metadata. Out of 28 judges, clerks and courthouse employees in Boradianka, 25 had their houses destroyed, said Shevchenko. “That’s a statistic for you,” said Shevchenko. The head of the Borodianka court, Hennadiy Stasenko, was still visibly shaken as he showed the Guardian the completely blackened courthouse building and stood in the spot where his office used to be. They now plan to submit the reams of evidence they have collectively gathered to the war crimes website set up by the prosecutor general’s office. Also contributing to the building of war crimes cases is the NGO Truth Hounds, which has been trained by former prosecutors from the international criminal court (ICC) to collect testimony that will be admissible. Truth Hounds started documenting war crimes in 2014 in eastern Ukraine. Now it is trying to train more staff to add to its body of investigators. “After [Venediktova] was appointed, she rehired a lot of the prosecutors who had been fired as part of the reform process,” said Yaropolk Brynykh, a board member of Truth Hounds, who was on the lustration board involved in interviewing and firing prosecutors. “She had to build a loyal team.” “But I hope that the war will change this behaviour. She has no other option,” said Brynykh, speaking from Stara Basan, a village 62 miles (100km) west of Kyiv where he was conducting interviews with residents who said one villager was shot for looking out the window and two more were taken to a neighbouring village and executed. “After the war, can you imagine the level of radicalisation of society, the demands they will make to the authorities?” Truth Hounds says it is aiming to help at least 10 foreign countries build national cases on Russian war crimes, including in Asia and Latin America. Other countries can launch their own criminal cases if their citizens were victims or if they house refugees who were affected. Wayne Jordash, a barrister whose legal firm has been almost the only one working on war crimes in Ukraine since 2014, said Venediktova was the first general prosecutor his firm had had direct contact with. “That was the kind of hands-on approach which was needed,” said Jordash. “Because, you know, if you look at the way the Ukrainian judicial system works, there’s a lot of different actors, and if they’re not coordinated from the top down, it’s difficult to investigate anything.” Jordash said there was a recognition inside and outside Ukraine that the scale of the events meant prosecutors needed support. He said there were plans to create mobile justice teams of foreign experts to mirror the work of Ukrainian investigators gathering evidence on the ground. aVenediktova has also set up an international advisory board to Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office that includes well-known international criminal lawyers such as Amal Clooney. “The international response has been unprecedented,” said Anna Neistat of the Clooney Foundation for Justice, which has announced that it too will be conducting its own investigations into war crimes in Ukraine. The ICC opened an investigation just days after the invasion, said Neistat, after 39 countries supported Ukraine’s request. “Every day we hear of new countries opening proceedings under universal law, extraterritorial jurisdictions,” said Neistat. Over a dozen countries had now launched their own investigations into Russian war crimes, said Neistat. Russia does not recognise the ICC and is unlikely to participate in proceedings launched in other jurisdictions. Nevertheless, said Neistat, there was the possibility that other countries would hand over indicted suspects who ventured outside of Russia in the future and would be on Interpol’s red notice list or an ICC indictment. Venediktova said that in the first days of the war she and the European court of justice created a joint investigation team, and that the first delegation of dozens of experts would arrive from France on Monday. “We feel we have real support right now.” “I’m not working for likes on Facebook,” said Venediktova. ”I am demonstrating to Ukraine and the international community the work of our entire law enforcement system. “You have to do your work first and foremost. Ukrainians can judge me once the work is done.”",News/World news,Prosecution of Russian war crimes is ultimate test for Ukraine’s state,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/russian-war-crimes-prosecution-ukraine
4/11/2022,"Things change fast this time of year. One moment it feels like summer, the next like deepest winter. New migrants arrive every day. One morning this week I found that the muddy area by the gate in the horses’ field had morphed overnight into a thriving colony of common frogs. What had been a marshy, trampled patch of wet ground was now heaving with life; the standing water had become a thick broth of frogspawn, gelatinous and quivering in an unhealthy khaki green. At first I couldn’t see the frogs themselves, but as I clattered by, headcollar in hand, they revealed themselves: glossy and dark, palm-sized, moving with deliberate slowness, concealed up to their necks. Though disturbed, they were reluctant to leave the pool if I didn’t pose an immediate threat. Some lifted their heads to watch for movement, their eyes glassy and gold-rimmed, expressionless. Others clambered laboriously over one another in a half-hearted effort to get away, turning their leopard-spotted backs to me, fat thighs glistening in the April sun. This was a foul gathering. Nearby, a fat plastic pipe protruded from a bank, trickling drainage water from the upper fields. Green algae feathered the edges. Some kind soul from the stables had made an attempt to dam the pool with rocks, containing most of the water and the frogs out of the path of the horses’ clumsy hooves. Still, to my eyes it seemed neither a safe nor salubrious spot to bring up one’s children. Never mind. The frogs will soon be gone, leaving the tadpoles to cope alone, as they always do. Last year I watched through my fingers as a batch of tadpoles squirmed and writhed in a ditch at the edge of the golf course. They faced a nail-biting race against time – those who could not metamorphose in time would suffocate and die as the water evaporated around them. But frogs have evolved to deal with exactly these conditions. If tadpoles sense their puddle to be drying out, they will rapidly assume form as tiny froglets, days ahead of schedule. It’s a hard life, and many won’t make it. But though it might be tempting to move them to a “more suitable” location, it’s best not to interfere. Ugly it may be, but the frogs know what they’re doing.

4/11/2022,"Plus-size clothing will have a dedicated runway show at Australian fashion week this year, for the first time in the event’s 26-year history. “I’ve been fighting and working for this for 20-something years now,” said CEO of size-inclusive modelling agency Bella Management, Chelsea Bonner, who will be staging The Curve Edit: one of 50 fashion shows and presentations taking place in Sydney in May. “If I had pitched this idea even five years ago, it never would have happened,” Bonner said. “It’s a whole new world. The way we think about bodies, the way we think about ourselves is so different now.” Diversity has become a watchword for the fashion industry in recent years. But at the higher end of the market, size inclusivity is a particular sticking point. In Australia, many of the designers who show their collections at fashion week do not make clothing above a size 12 or 14. Last year’s Australian fashion week drew significant criticism for its lack of larger bodies on the runway, with model Kate Wasley branding size diversity “non existent”. After the 2021 event, artist and model Basjia Almaan, who walked in several shows, also spoke out. “Yes I’m a curve model but I’m still palatable. I’m a size 12-14,” she wrote on Instagram. “Where were the BIGGER bodies.” Bonner pitched the idea for a plus-size runway to IMG, the US-based events company that owns Australian fashion week. She says the concept was welcomed with open arms. “We’re working to create a more accessible and equitable industry by ensuring talented designers, creatives and fashion professionals of all identities have the opportunities and resources they need to succeed,” Natalie Xenita, who heads IMG’s Australian fashion events, said. The Curve Edit is not the only first for the event. Adaptive fashion – clothing designed for customers with disabilities – will also be featured in a stand-alone runway show. “People with disabilities deserve more than basics,” said Molly Rogers, of Jam the Label, who will be staging the show with fellow adaptive designer Christina Stephens, under the banner Adaptive Clothing Collective. “It’s super important to show that people with disabilities can look … runway ready,” Rogers said. The Adaptive Clothing Collective will custom-make every runway look specifically for the needs of their models. Adjustments include magnetic fastenings in place of buttons, and higher seat rises in pants, for wheelchair users. “It’s amazing to have diversity and representation [at fashion week],” Rogers says. “But … [creating] items that actually cater for people’s needs is more than tokenistic.” Australian fashion week’s consumer-facing closing show in 2021 received criticism on social media for failing to consider the needs of model and Paralympian Rheed McCracken, who had to push his wheelchair down a runway covered in streamers and confetti. “Being an adaptive clothing brand I was across all those sort of things,” Rogers said of that incident. “And the main thing I would say from that is that they [fashion week’s organisers] are not shying away and are not disheartened.” Australian fashion week is traditionally a trade event, where designers present samples of their upcoming collections for wholesale buyers and media. The Adaptive Clothing Collective and the Curve Edit will both break fashion week’s usual business model. Rather than selling the clothes on the runway, showcasing a collection of entirely custom-made garments is about demonstrating proof-of-concept, Rogers explains. “We would love if media, and fashion retailers, can come and learn.” For a modelling agency like Bonner’s to stage and pay for a runway show is also unusual. “Why is the owner of a modelling and talent agency presenting the show?” Bonner said. “I don’t know the answer to that.” “I don’t know if it’s because designers are terrified to put anyone over a size 12 or 14 on the runway, or if designers who cater [to those sizes] don’t know how to apply, or don’t have the funding,” Bonner said. Timothy Hugh Nicol, of fashion brand Nicol and Ford, gives some insight into why designers might avoid size-diverse runways. Committing to it is “committing to double the work”. In 2021 Nicol and partner Katie Louise Ford staged their first runway show, the week before Australian fashion week. In a single presentation, it featured a greater range of body shapes than most of the following week’s shows combined. “We design for our community, [so] we cast from our community,” said Ford. This year, the pair will be joining Australian fashion week’s official lineup. Nicol said the show will “be very diverse in terms of physicality and gender expression”. “We do work backwards, we start with our casting,” said Ford. “It’s the only way we would do it, but it takes more lead time.” “It means that we make a second and custom version of every garment,” Nicol said. “It is complex, it takes a certain amount of pattern making and production.” But, “it’s a labour of love”. Nicol and Ford are not currently a wholesale business. The pair sew all of their garments themselves, out of their studio in Newtown. While Nicol said wholesaling is something they may explore in the future, the presence of small labels like theirs on fashion week’s lineup suggests the event is becoming less about trade, and more about public interest. “IMG used to be all about media and buyers,” said Nicol. But now Nicol believes IMG “can see a public interest in less commercial work”. Bonner, on the other hand, believes that committing to body diversity on runways is a commercial decision. “It doesn’t make any sense not to cater up to at least a size 18,” she said. “That’s where most women live and sit.” The Curve Edit will feature six designers – 17 Sundays, Saint Somebody, Embody Women, Vagary, Harlow and Zaliea Designs – who Bonner describes as long-term clients of her agency. Bonner says designers who do not cater to larger sizes are spending 100% of their energy on 20% of the population. “There’s a huge market they’re missing out on, of beautiful, fashionable, forward thinking women. I am that woman,” she said. “We know how much retail’s been struggling. We’ve seen so many top designers go under, and I feel like if they’d been more inclusive, that might not have happened.” Australian fashion week runs in Sydney from 9 to 13 May",Lifestyle/Fashion,‘It’s a whole new world’: Australian fashion week to feature first plus-size runway,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/11/its-a-whole-new-world-australian-fashion-week-to-feature-first-plus-size-runway
