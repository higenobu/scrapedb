3/29/2022,"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Rowdy spring break crowds have forced curfews and led some establishments to close their doors from Miami Beach to Florida's Panhandle. Law enforcement officials in Bay County, Florida, said Sunday that they won't tolerate the bad behavior from spring breakers after a 21-year-old from Alabama was shot in the foot Sunday during a shooting in Panama City Beach. ”The crowd that has been here this weekend, there are no words that can describe the way they have behaved themselves, conducted themselves and the amount of laws they have broken,” Panama City Beach police Chief J.R. Talamantez said during a news conference on Sunday afternoon. “We are doing the best to manage this situation.” Police received word that the large crowd was out of control just before the shooting happened on Sunday afternoon. Three people were detained and officials said they could be charged with attempted murder. Some 50 to 60 guns have been confiscated from spring breakers, according to Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford. Some local nightclubs volunteered to close their doors on Sunday night, Panama City police Chief Mark Smith said. “They are not catering to the spring break crowd,"" Smith said. “It just can’t be tolerated."" In South Florida, raucous crowds, public drinking and growing violence associated with the city’s world-famous South Beach neighborhood led officials to impose a midnight curfew over the weekend. The action followed shootings that injured five people on South Beach last week. The 10-block stretch of Ocean Drive known for art deco hotels, restaurants and bars lies between areas that cater to more affluent tourists, as well as locals. Many longtime residents have learned to treat spring break like a hurricane: Stay inside and hunker down until it’s over. When asked about a possible curfew in Panama City Beach, Talamantez said “nothing is off the table."" He said officials are evaluating the situation. “I know the citizens are frustrated. Trust me, we are frustrated too,"" Talamantez said. “The harsh reality is we cannot control who comes to town. But what we can control is what happens to you if you commit a crime in this town. We will hold you accountable.""",U.S./Associated Press,Florida officials fight back against rowdy spring breakers,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-officials-fight-back-against-154118405.html
3/29/2022,"By Kantaro Komiya TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will revise its foreign exchange law to prevent Russia from evading Western financial sanctions following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine through cryptocurrency assets, top government officials said on Monday. The government will submit a revision of the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act to the current parliament session to strengthen protections against potential sanction-busting by Russia through digital assets, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said in a press conference. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also called for the law to be amended in a Monday parliament session, where he stressed the need for coordinated moves with Western allies after attending last week's Group of Seven summit in Belgium. A finance ministry official told Reuters discussions were under way about the proposed amendment, saying he could not provide further details. The revision ""presumably enables the government to apply the law to crypto-asset exchanges like banks and oblige them to scrutinise whether their clients are Russian sanction targets,"" said Saisuke Sakai, senior economist at Mizuho Research and Technologies. Following the invasion of Ukraine, the Japanese government has slapped asset-freeze sanctions on more than 100 Russian officials, oligarchs, banks and other institutions. Japan has also banned high-tech exports and revoked the most-favoured nation trade status for Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"". Earlier this month, Japan's financial regulatory body demanded about 30 crypto exchanges in the country not to conduct asset transactions with sanction targets. A legislative revision is a stronger step to implement such regulations. According to economist Sakai, Kishida's government probably developed the legal revision plan given Western authorities' stricter rules on the subject, as well as high Japanese public support for sanctioning Russia.

3/29/2022,"The silence of the Polish countryside is shattered by the piercing rattle of heavy artillery fire. A smokescreen obscures the horizon, and suddenly, the soldiers swarm. Moving in on armored vehicles, in helicopters, and atop assault watercraft, more than 2,000 soldiers combine to form a united front on the battlefield against an imagined enemy. This is a NATO exercise--preparation in case these troops are called upon to defend the alliance's territory. While it's a scenario that once seemed unthinkable, here—just 10 miles from the Belarusian border and against a geopolitical backdrop dominated by rapacious Russian aggression, this is more than just a drill. MORE: Biden admin avoiding 'red line' over any Russian use of chemical weapons in Ukraine ""It's a show of force,"" Lt. Karol Frankowski of Poland told ABC News, adding that Belarus—Russia's staunchest ally—is likely watching over them via aircraft or drone. Soldiers from Poland, Croatia, Romania, the U.K. and U.S. make up the battle group, one of four that received a surge of manpower to defend the eastern front in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Their American commander, Lt. Col. Trevor Phillips, said today's practice feels ""absolutely"" different, colored by the crisis. ""It's difficult to watch and not be able to do anything about it. We're direct action type people. Our whole motto while we are here is 'stronger together,'"" Frankowski said. ""No nation should stand alone. That's why this is so important to us."" Even the objective of the practice is shaped by the warfare in Ukraine. The scenario--troops facing off against rival forces who attempt to barricade a bridge—recreates the challenges of modern warfare, officials said. ""The idea is to destroy the enemy and make free passage for the troops,"" Col. Piotr Fajkowsli, the leader of the Polish brigade, told ABC News. MORE: Full transcript of President Biden's speech in Warsaw on Russia's invasion of Ukraine  ABC News' Martha Raddatz asked Fajkowsli if he believed Russia would ever strike inside his homeland's boundaries. ""Anything can happen,"" said Fajkowsli, saying that not long ago, the thought of Russia descending on Ukraine with such brute force would have been considered by most to be ""impossible in the 21st century."" ""Now we can see destroyed towns burning. It is crazy,"" he said. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during Friday's press briefing it's an assessment the president and the White House believe as well. ""We do believe Russian aggression in Ukraine shows a willingness by the Russians to disregard international borders and to disregard the basic rules of the road of the international community that have been built in sustained over the course of seven decades,"" he said. Fajkowsli said they are ready to face anything the opposition throws at them. The people he is sworn to protect are a different story. MORE: Ukrainian forces on offensive, Russian combat capability falls below 90%: Pentagon update ""We as soldiers are ready to fight against chemical weapons. We have protective gear. The civilians, they don't,"" he said. ""This is the danger."" After the bridge is won, the troops break. With the day's mission completed, they stand temporarily at ease. They will convene again tomorrow to once again play out these war games that now seem all too real. Phillips hopes the conflict doesn't spill over NATO's borders. ""But if it does, we're ready,"" he said.
