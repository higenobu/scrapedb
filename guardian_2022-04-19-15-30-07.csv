4/19/2022,"In the 1950s and 60s, nearly every singer of Latin descent who pined to become a star in the US or UK had to eradicate any trace of ethnicity from their name. Thus, Richard Valenzuela became Ritchie Valens, Domingo Samudio morphed into Sam the Sham, Baldemar Huerta reimagined himself as Freddy Fender, and Florencia Cardona simply became Vikki Carr. In the most extreme example, a five-man Chicano band led by Rudy Martinez wound up hiding under the anonymous moniker Question Mark and The Mysterians before releasing their garage-rock classic 96 Tears. Given all that, the choices Trini Lopez made about his moniker back then seem especially principled and brave. “Trini said to the world, ‘This is my heritage. I’m Mexican and there’s no reason I should have to erase that,’” said P David Ebersole, co-director of the new documentary My Name Is Lopez. “He was willing to walk out on a record deal if they wouldn’t use his real name. Back then, that was phenomenal.” While that decision, along with his music, made Trini Lopez a revered figure in Latin cultures around the world, today he is little remembered by the majority of music fans. In fact, even most of those who do recall his hits from the early to mid-60s are unaware of the trends Lopez anticipated or the innovations he helped forge. Lopez, who died of Covid in 2020 at age 83, was instrumental in the creation of folk-rock, having electrified, and sped-up, acoustic ballads a year before Dylan plugged-in. He was also key to the formation of Latin-rock, as one of the first Latin stars to score hits by injecting the hoots and trills of traditional Mexican music into rockabilly. More, he anticipated a trend in live albums as career-defining works by issuing his million-selling collection Live at PJ’s in 1963, years before conical concert recordings by The Allman Brothers, The Who and Peter Frampton. More, he was the only Latin member of Frank Sinatra’s Rat Pack, and the first with a name like Lopez to headline Las Vegas. As a musician, he had the rare honor of being asked by the Gibson Guitar company to consult on the design of two signature instruments, both of which have become collectors’ items prized by stars like Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters and Noel Gallagher of Oasis. In the film, Grohl points to his ruby-red Lopez Gibson before announcing, “This is the sound of the Foo Fighters.” So, why is so little of his legacy acknowledged or remembered? “Trini outlived his fame,” said Ebersole. “He was white hot in his moment but music changed in the 70s and 80s and a lot of the artists of his time became outmoded.” More, “Trini got stuck in what he did well,” said the film’s other director, Todd Hughes. “He never had that reinvention.” At the same time, Lopez made a miraculous transformation from the impoverished environment of his youth. His parents, who met and married as teenagers in the poor town of Moroleon, Mexico, came to Texas as illegal immigrants seeking a better life. Settling in the “Little Mexico” ghetto of Dallas, they struggled to raise six kids in an area ruled by Black and Mexican gangs. To keep Lopez from getting involved, his father, an aspiring musician himself, bought the boy a $12 guitar from a pawn shop. Guided by his dad, Lopez learned traditional Mexican folk songs like El Rancho Grande and Cielito Lindo, whose fluid melodies and broad cadences would inform his later work. But he struggled at school, hobbled by the long hours he had to spend picking beets and potatoes in local fields to help support his family. Still, Ebersole said, “it would be hard to call his childhood unhappy. He had a beautiful family situation. They all took care of each other. And his parents had a great belief in their boy’s star quality.” By 10, Lopez led his first combo; by high school he was playing Dallas nightclubs. Following a performance one night, he was introduced to a fellow Texan who had already made it big: Buddy Holly. “Buddy was the first one who didn’t look down on him as a Mexican,” said Lopez’s longtime companion, Oralee Walker, in the film. In fact, Holly introduced Lopez to his producer, Norman Petty, who landed his band a deal with Columbia Records. But there were serious caveats: he couldn’t use his own name and he could no longer lead the band as singer. In a move that proved characteristic, Lopez politely thanked Petty for the opportunity before bowing out. “Trini always had an attitude of gratitude and respect,” Hughes said. It helped that he soon got his own deal with the Dallas-based Volk Records. Again, however, they told him to hide his heritage. But, this time when Lopez politely declined, the company caved, allowing him to record a song in 1958 whose key lyrics expressed his faith in his talent and his identity – “I’ve got the right to rock.” After hearing that recording, King Records, then home to artists from James Brown to Little Willie John, signed Lopez but the songs he cut for the label never ignited. A fresh opportunity grew out of a historic tragedy. In February of 1959, a plane carrying Buddy Holly, Valens and the Big Bopper crashed, killing a whole swath of the era’s pop talent in an instant. Later, Holly’s producer, Snuff Garrett, asked Lopez to become the new front man of the late star’s band, the Crickets. Upon arriving in LA to join them, however, he found the other members had far more interest in partying than music. Since Lopez needed money to send back to his parents, he bowed out of the group to seek work as a solo performer in the nightclubs of Beverly Hills. After a year spent building his reputation as a live act, Lopez was awarded a regular gig at the hot club PJ’s, where stars like Steve McQueen and Frank Sinatra hung out. The buzz on Lopez’s shows there inspired Sinatra to send his producer, Don Costa, to sign him to his label, Reprise. At the time, the imprint was burdened with stars well past their sales prime, including Dean Martin and Sammy Davis. With Lopez, Reprise got a rising star whose sound straddled two of the most popular genres of the day – folk and rockabilly. A third element, Latin music, awarded his sound a whiff of the “exotic.” Recognizing the excitement Lopez was stirring at PJ’s, Costa had the idea to record his debut album in the club with his core trio. For an immersive effect, he placed a microphone on the floor to capture the sound of the audience dancing and clapping along. The result, Live at PJ’s, soared to No 2 on the Billboard album chart. Its material emphasized Lopez’s lineage by opening with America from West Side Story, (even if it did conflate his Mexican background with the characters’ Puerto Rican identity). The set also featured Cielito Lindo and a take on La Bamba, which Valens had turned into a pop smash five years earlier. Even so, Lopez’s version wound up outselling it internationally. Likewise, two socially-conscious songs on the album had already been hits for Peter Paul and Mary: If I Had a Hammer and Lemon Tree. But Lopez’s more rhythmic take on the former reached No 3 (compared to the folk trio’s 10), while his version of the latter broke Billboard’s Top Ten (besting PP&M’s recording which stalled at 35). Dylan must have been impressed by Lopez’s new folk-rock sound because he later hired his drummer, Mickey Jones, for his band. In 1964, Lopez became the only artist ever asked by Gibson to help design two new guitar models at the same time. The first, based on a fat-bodied jazz guitar, has become a collector’s item. The second, a thinner-bodied Trini Standard, returned to production in the ’90s after Grohl loudly touted it. ZZ Top front man and fellow Texan Billy Gibbons calls it “a very fine instrument. Most players of that guitar favor the low string action, the balanced feel of the body and the beefy neck,” he wrote in an email. Despite earning such cred among the rock cognoscenti, Lopez’s role in the Rat Pack made him uncool to rock fans for decades. Not that Lopez minded. He idolized Sinatra. At the same time, his relationship with Sinatra was complex. His mentor always made sure to emphasize his superior role and, in 1968, he wound up derailing Lopez’s budding acting career. That year, Lopez landed a plum role in The Dirty Dozen, a movie bound to become a major hit. When production ran months over, however, Sinatra told Lopez to quit so he could go back into the studio to earn more money for Reprise. “Frank ruined Trini’s movie career,” Hughes said. Even so, he continued to soar on TV, appearing on all the big variety shows and even hosting his own series in 1969. The documentary features many clips of his time on TV. Some are uncomfortable to watch. To stoke laughs, Lopez often relies on Mexican stereotypes making fun of the food and the water. But, said Ebersole, “that was his survival technique. He would make fun of himself before they could make fun of him. He used charm as a weapon.” In fact, whenever Lopez talks in the film about the racism he faced, he shows no rancor. His longtime companion Walker, who was interviewed extensively for the film, expresses it for him. According to the directors, Lopez never wanted to say anything negative in public during his lifetime. Only after he died, when Walker felt free to speak, did the film-makers have access to a fuller picture of the man. According to the directors, Lopez’s death came as a surprise. Though he was in good health for his age, he needed a minor operation in the summer of 2020. After leaving the hospital, he began to feel ill and, so, went back in. Ten days later he died, suggesting that he may have picked up a virulent strain of Covid during his earlier stay. To honor the legacy Lopez left behind, the directors hope their film educates people about his many accomplishments. “Just saying, ‘no, I won’t change my name,’ created ripples in the culture that have led us to where we are today,” said Hughes. “He really did change the world.” My Name Is Lopez will be available to rent digitally in the US on 26 April and in the UK at a later date",Arts/Film,‘He really did change the world’: the incredible story of musician Trini Lopez,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/18/trini-lopez-mexican-american-singer-my-name-is-lopez
4/19/2022,"“You can just see the buoys of the seafarm,” Dr Sophie Steinhagen yells over the high whine of the boat as it approaches the small islands of Sweden’s Koster archipelago. The engine drops to a sputter, and Steinhagen heaves up a rope to reveal the harvest hanging beneath: strand after strand of sea lettuce, translucent and emerald green.“This is one individual that we would collect now and keep as a parent, because it’s growing very fast,” she exclaims. In summer, these waters teem with sea kayaks and yachts from neighbouring Norway, but for Steinhagen and the seafarming group at the Tjärnö Marine Laboratory, spring is their peak season. For one thing, it means less animal and plant life on the seaweed.“When you buy a lettuce, you don’t want to have a caterpillar in there. The same is true for seaweed: you don’t want a crab or snail eggs”. More importantly, spring is also when sea lettuce yields the most protein. In fact, experts believe that seaweed could be a key crop in the “protein shift” away from meat. Some of last spring’s harvest here hit about 30% protein, close to the level that would make it compete against the world’s other big protein sources like meat and soya. Steinhagen also believes passionately that this plant – long eaten as “green laver” on the coasts of Britain – can be a more sustainable alternative to soya. Sea lettuce doesn’t draw on scarce resources of land and fresh water.“There is no other option,” she says later, on a bench outside the Tjärnö Marine Laboratory’s greenhouses. “Climate change is affecting most of our crop systems and we are in urgent need of new production. We cannot extend terrestrial farmland – so we need to go into the ocean.”It’s not just a protein source. As we shift to a bio-based rather than fossil-fuel-based economy, seaweed could provide a lot of the compounds we need. For example, Ulrica Edlund, Steinhagen’s collaborator at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, is a professor of polymer science who has used polysaccharides extracted from seaweed to make plastic films, filaments and other plastic materials. “It’s circular because it provides a route away from fossil-based plastics. It allows you to use biomass that can be produced at a really high rate in the oceans,” Edlund says. “You don’t have to wait 50 years for the forest to grow until you can harvest those polymers.” New startup packaging companies are using these advances to develop seaweed-based plastics, such as the UK’s Notpla or the US company Sway, though there are challenges, too: unless you take steps to alter their chemical structure, seaweed plastics absorb rather than repel water, turning them into a formless slime. Seaweed farming is also, outside Asia, in its infancy. But the techniques Steinhagen’s team have helped develop are beginning to be applied more widely. Nordic Sea Farms, a company spun-off from the laboratory, has long been growing sugar kelp, and has seen soaring demand from local restaurants and biomaterials startups. In October, it launched an EU-funded programme to develop commercial sea lettuce cultivation at Otterön, or Otter Island, 20km down the coast towards Gothenburg.“As far as we are aware, there’s no sea-based cultivation of Ulva [sea lettuce] up-and-running on a commercial scale,” says Göran Nylund, a former researcher at the marine laboratory, who co-founded the company.The first seeded ropes – 20km of them – will be set out this autumn, with the first harvest expected next spring. Seaweed plantations are beginning to pop up all along Europe’s Atlantic and North Sea coasts. There are now at least seven seaweed farming companies in neighbouring Norway. In the Faroe Islands, there is Ocean Rainforest, perhaps Europe’s leading seaweed producer. Others have sprouted in Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, the UK, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. There are even emerging multinationals: Dutch-owned The Seaweed Company operates farms in Ireland, Morocco and India.Despite all this, Europe still produces only a tiny fraction of the world’s seaweed: 90% of the estimated £14bn seaweed market is produced in Asia, where entire bays in China, Indonesia and Japan are taken up by seaweed farms. The EU currently produces only a tiny 1,000 tonnes of seaweed a year, against 35m tonnes of global production, although a report by the advisory firm Systemiq argues that it could potentially hit 8m tonnes a year by the end of this decade.“First of all, you need to find the water area, and – compared to Asia – that’s pretty complicated,” Nyland says of the barriers. “Another challenge is that we need some technical development. [Asian countries] have been doing this for a long time, but [some] are also low-income countries, so their methodologies are not suitable for us, because our salaries are too high.” One way to find more sea access is The Seaweed Company’s experiment in growing seaweed between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea. Meanwhile, some companies are developing their own seaweed harvesting machinery to make the job less labour intensive. But there’s still no seaweed equivalent of a combine harvester or tractor you can buy off the shelf.At Tjärnö, which is part of the University of Gothenburg, Steinhagen is working hard to improve seaweed strains to make them more productive, just as terrestrial crops have been improved over centuries. “We want to find strains which have a high growth rate and simultaneously a high protein content,” she says. “This can be done by genetic selection or strain selection – the usual horticultural methods – but we can also select for different nutrients which could enrich the protein content.” In the laboratories, she shows her “seaweed kindergarten”: rows of bubbling cylindrical tanks where she breeds new varieties, clones new plants, and seeds plants on rolls of twine which are then wrapped on the ropes and laid out to sea. “You see that the outer margins are brownish – that’s where they release the swarmers,” she says, showing me a container of sexually mature sea lettuce. “It’s just like sperm: they have flagella, they can move.”This is only half of the puzzle. In the city of Gothenburg, a team at Chalmers University of Technology is looking at how to most efficiently and economically extract the protein. Prof Ingrid Undeland, the research coordinator for Blue Food, Sweden’s “Centre for Future Seafood”, says that seaweed is getting ever more “trendy” but she wants it to escape from high-end New Nordic restaurants and vegan food stores and be sold as a commodified bulk protein powder – like the ones derived from soya, whey or pea that are used to make vegetarian mince. The new product will, she concedes, have “a little bit more of a marine flavour profile” than the almost tasteless whey and soy protein. “If you want to make a vanilla smoothie that doesn’t taste of anything, that might be challenging,” she says. “But if you want to make a savoury product, with some umami, saltiness and marine flavour, it could be an advantage.”Unlike soya and pea plants, where protein is concentrated in special bodies in the cells of the bean or pea, seaweed protein is spread much more widely, both in the plants and inside their cells, making the protein harder to reach with the weak alkali used in extraction. João Trigo is a PhD student in Undeland’s lab, working on improving extraction techniques. At best, he says, he can now extract about 10% of the protein in sea lettuce. Given that dried sea lettuce is at best 30% protein, that means only three grams of protein would come out of 100g of dry sea lettuce.In his office, he holds up the end result of his labours: a test tube containing a small amount of green crystalline flakes which took a whole sack of sea lettuce to produce. “Let’s say if we start with 10kg of fresh sea lettuce, we might end up with around 40g of dried protein isolate,” he says. “So that tells you that we still have some way to go.” The solution, he and Edlund agree, might be a biorefinery approach, with the protein removed first, then other useful substances such as thickening agents already used in the food industry, then polysaccharides for plastics. The remainder could then be burned as biofuel.“It would be a shame to throw this biomass away,” Edlund says.“There are so many sophisticated molecules in there that nature made, so why not make the most of them?” Steinhagen is confident that her pilot farm is the start of a new industry. “People always laugh at the person doing new things,” she says. “But look today, we have electricity and we have cars. It takes time.”",News/Environment,Sea-farmed supercrop: how seaweed could transform the way we live,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/19/sea-farmed-supercrop-how-seaweed-could-transform-the-way-we-live
4/19/2022,"This time two years ago, as the country went into lockdown, the neighbourhood WhatsApp group came into its own. It often just spanned a couple of streets – but the shock of the moment and the surge of civic spirit delivered at least one adult in any 40-m radius, prepared to do the legwork of tracking down every phone. And it would be stupid to the point of deliberate amnesia to pretend that it didn’t, at the time, seem like something genuinely beautiful was happening – solidarity, care, mutual aid, respectful watchfulness, a forest of collective responsibility springing up overnight, where previously there had only been the odd tendril of “do you have my parcel?”, and “did you hear that last night – do you think it was a fox or a murder?” My group fell apart over low-traffic neighbourhoods. That’s not quite right; it would be more accurate to say it split irretrievably, divided by the most profound ideological differences, but stayed together on the tacit understanding that LTNs would never be spoken of again, except when they were, and the fight would be more brutal every time. It was a lot like the Labour party. In more Tory areas, they mainly fell out over cats. So, it turned out that there was an upside to the era when nobody knew anyone else’s phone number: you might suspect that your cat had gone to live at number 42, but would be unlikely to confront them over it. And if you did, it would only be in the mildest possible terms, certainly without the audience of the entire rest of the street, and these conventions were a vital protection for civility because – newsflash – your cat doesn’t care where you think it lives. Teenagers were another flashpoint. There is a very clear social dividing line, which I’m sure could serve as a useful tool of psephological analysis, between people who think of adolescents as large children, warranting care and protection, and people who think they are waging a deliberate war of provocation just by wearing a jumper, the threat-level rising to imminent if they put the hood up (even when it’s raining). A friend’s neighbourhood group disintegrated when some teens were observed smoking weed; the emergency services were called and the operator got the wrong end of the stick, summoning an ambulance instead of the police. A bitter row ensued over the teens’ punishment. One person wanted them to go and apologise to the paramedics. Another said, “You want them to atone for wasting paramedics’ time by wasting more of their time?”, and a third said, “the time-waster here is the person who called 999.” Social attitudes, on the matter of soft drugs, are quite divergent, though such a total disintegration is pretty rare. Normally, after a storm, the group stays together but everyone goes silent, except for the three people who always need a cardboard box, and the one person who always has one. There’s surely a market for some kind of cardboard box Tinder. While we thought we were doing something quite simple and blitz-spirited – meeting a moment of timeless challenge with new tools and fresh selves – in fact, what we were doing was incredibly complicated. We were trying to take our meat-world selves – where we are generally emollient, guarded, always looking for the subtlest clues to an acquaintance’s worldview and pre-emptively avoiding saying the opposite – and merging them with our virtual-world selves, where we are absolutely full of views, and will spend hours or at least minutes crafting them into their strongest possible expression. It’s enough to start a war between your own two selves, let alone you and your neighbour, who’s trying to lard some casual snobbery into a conversation about dogs (the time-honoured route is “I’ll never understand why those young men need to have dogs like that”). Yet it hasn’t been a failure: that early promise of a new Eden. When the chips were down, we cared about each other. It just hit a hump in the road. The management cliche about groups – form, storm, norm, perform – is as true of neighbours as it is of an underperforming sales team. We’re currently in the “storm” phase.

However, that trip too was cancelled (by us) and at the time we accepted a voucher to the value of £1,654 – the cost of the original trip, minus the £200 upgrade cost. Last week I tried to use the voucher to book a new trip, only to be told it had expired. It turns out that it had an expiry date of just six months. This seems very harsh to me. It had only expired 16 days before I tried to use it – but the company is refusing to budge. We received no warning that it was due to expire. Is this fair?

However, this does feel rather harsh. In this case you opted to cancel the trip, as was permitted by the travel firm. You are 79 and were understandably fearful of travelling last September. Last week I received an email from easyJet telling me that a £30 voucher I still had as a result of a Covid cancellation was about to lapse, and I would have thought other firms would be doing the same thing – particularly where the balance is for a significant sum.

4/19/2022,"Every now and again, a first novel appears in a flurry of hype and big-name TV deals, and before the end of the first chapter you do a little air-punch because for once it’s all completely justified. Lessons in Chemistry, by former copywriter Bonnie Garmus, is that rare beast; a polished, funny, thought-provoking story, wearing its research lightly but confidently, and with sentences so stylishly turned it’s hard to believe it’s a debut. Since the success of The Queen’s Gambit and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, there’s been a renewed interest in stories of pioneering women fighting to prove themselves in traditionally male arenas in the years – late 50s and early 60s – before second-wave feminism took off. Elizabeth Zott, the heroine of Lessons in Chemistry, follows firmly in their footsteps; the book also nods to the rediscovery of TV chef Julia Child as a trailblazer, and even echoes Breaking Bad’s Walter White in Elizabeth’s mantra: “Chemistry is change.” As the novel opens in 1961, Elizabeth is a 30-year-old single mother and the reluctant, “permanently depressed” star of a cooking show for housewives called Supper at Six. By training she is a research chemist, though her academic career has foundered despite her obvious talent, and as the narrative jumps back 10 years we understand why. Female scientists are viewed with suspicion by their male colleagues; from her earliest undergraduate days, Elizabeth has been subject to attacks on her reputation and her person, from the major – sexual assault and theft of her work – to the casual everyday misogyny meted out by people, including other women, who see her independence and single-mindedness as a threat. Even when she finds her soulmate, Nobel-nominated chemist Calvin Evans, their happiness is a further spur to jealous rivals and doomed not to last. Though she takes the TV gig to pay the bills after being fired from her research institute, Elizabeth initiates a quiet revolution, using her platform to speak directly to millions of housewives about their own capacity for change. Garmus’s great skill here is to create a richly comic novel around a character who is entirely deadpan, and to whom some pretty dreadful things happen: “She’d been defined not by what she did, but by what others had done.” The comedy exists in the gap between Elizabeth’s calm but dogged refusal to be anything less than herself, and the determination of those around her to squeeze her into an acceptable mould. There are, inevitably, a few first-novel flaws: the narrative perspective hops around too often, dallying with minor characters when its strength is in Elizabeth’s inner life. There’s a semi-magic-realist strand from the viewpoint of Elizabeth’s unnaturally perceptive dog, which some readers may find charming and quirky and others somewhat grating. But Garmus understands the importance of a satisfying resolution; if her revenge comedy relies a little too heavily on coincidence, that’s all part of the larger-than-life, Technicolor world she has created. It’s easy to see how fluently the story will translate to the screen, but the real pleasure of the novel is in the dry wit of Garmus’s writing.

4/19/2022,"Online casinos face a crackdown on exploiting gamblers’ superstitions, after the advertising regulator launched an investigation into one firm’s claims about certain games being “hot or cold”. The Guardian understands the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) is likely to uphold a complaint lodged seven months ago against PlayOJO, which advertised a feature last year that offered gamblers a “unique chance to see the games on winning streaks”. “Switch between HOT or COLD to reveal the MOST and LEAST profitable games of the hour, updated every 5 minutes,” the website told players. The online casino, which is licensed by the Gambling Commission and owned by the Malta-based company Skill On Net Limited, suggested they could either play “hot” games to see if they continued paying out or try to “change the luck” on games that were not. The page on PlayOJO’s website that included the promotional material was not available at time of publication but could be found via cached versions. The feature was also promoted via a TV ad in which a tarot card reader gave a customer advice while secretly using the PlayOJO mobile phone app to inform her predictions. Although the ASA has yet to make a final decision, a draft version of its recommendation seen by the Guardian indicates it will uphold a complaint that promoting the feature was “misleading” and “irresponsible”. The ruling, if confirmed, will affect whether firms can exploit the “gambler’s fallacy”, the false notion that previous outcomes have any effect on what will happen next. An example of this is the mistaken belief that a roulette ball is more likely to land on a number because it has not done so for a while. The ASA’s draft ruling warned that PlayOJO’s marketing did contain elements that suggested players could exert control over game outcomes, including the exhortation to “choose your destiny”. Bookmakers have previously come under fire for advertising “hot” and “cold” numbers on fixed-odds betting terminals, the controversial digital roulette machines whose stakes were slashed from £100 to £2 after an outcry about their links to addiction. However, the ASA’s draft ruling against PlayOJO is thought to be the first time a regulator has specifically targeted the feature, with potential implications for the wider gambling industry. PlayOJO said it had not been requested to remove the page on its website offering the “hot” or “cold” feature and had not done so. However, it said it was “in the process of tweaking certain marketing materials” and had “therefore removed these pages from our site, to address specific concerns”, and would replace them soon. It added that the ASA may yet agree that the marketing did not breach the advertising code. An ASA spokesperson said it did not comment on individual cases. A spokesperson for the Betting & Gaming Council, a lobby group of which Skill On Net is a member, said it could not comment on individual cases.",News/Society,Online casinos face crackdown on exploiting gamblers’ superstitions,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/19/online-casinos-face-crackdown-on-exploiting-gamblers-superstitions
4/19/2022,"A group of climate scientists, archaeologists and those familiar with the museum industry have written to the British Museum’s board of trustees to urge them to sever a sponsorship deal with BP, arguing that it goes against the museum’s own policies and that a renewal would damage its reputation. The submission, put together by the group Culture Unstained, is part of an escalating campaign against the oil firm’s sponsorship of the museum, which is expected to make a decision about renewing the deal imminently. It is signed by Sir Robert Watson, the former chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services; Naomi Oreskes, a professor of the history of science at Harvard University; and Rodney Harrison, a professor of heritage studies at University College London (UCL). Other signatories include Willow Coningham, from the UK Student Climate Network; Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, which represents many British Museum staff; Paul Ekins, a professor of resources and environmental policy at UCL and the former co-director of the UK Energy Research Centre; Jonathon Porritt, the founder director of Forum for the Future; Hilary Jennings, the director of the Happy Museum Project; and Dr Chris Garrard, the co-director of Culture Unstained. They highlight the many ways in which BP’s record regarding the climate crisis “clearly falls short of the scale and ambition of corporate responses that are now required”. They call on the museum’s board of trustees to “fulfil their legal duties” by ensuring a due diligence process is undertaken before a decision is made about any new deal with the company. Trustees, they say, have “the capacity to reject a proposed partnership with BP because it would not conflict with their fiduciary responsibilities”. They allege that a failure to do so “could leave the museum exposed to regulatory intervention”. The submission also calls for George Osborne, the museum chair, and Philipp Hildebrand, a board member, to recuse themselves from discussions on BP sponsorship “due to their conflict of interest” – BP is a client of Osborne’s banking firm Robey Warshaw, while Hildebrand is the vice chair of BlackRock, one of BP’s largest shareholders. “The majority of UK cultural organisations, including the National Portrait Gallery, Royal Shakespeare Company, Tate, Edinburgh international festival and Scottish Ballet, have now ended their sponsorship agreements with BP, while the National Theatre, National Gallery, Southbank Centre and the British Film Institute have all ended their partnerships with Shell,” the submission continues. “The British Museum would be isolated both in its continued acceptance of sponsorship from a fossil-fuel-producing company and its lack of a clear ethical stance on this issue.” BP has been a sponsor of the British Museum for years and is a supporter of its Stonehenge exhibition. The current five-year contract was signed in May 2016 and extended for a year due to Covid. Harrison said the British Museum’s relationship with BP was “clearly out of step” with the rest of the cultural sector. He added: “BP’s well-publicised involvement in fossil fuel lobbying and ongoing oil and gas exploration, which threatens the world’s attempts to meet agreed global heating targets … clearly makes it an inappropriate partner for a museum which purports to act for the preservation of the world’s cultures. “At a time when national and international codes of ethics for the sector urge museums to ensure they work in the public interest, uphold the highest level of institutional integrity and maintain transparent relationships with partner organisations, the British Museum’s conduct raises questions of international concern which the trustees must address.” A recent freedom of information request made by Culture Unstained revealed how leading figures from large corporations, including BP, are members of an “influential but almost entirely unaccountable” group advising the British Museum. The museum has said claims it is inappropriately influenced by any donations or sponsorship “are simply incorrect”. The museum’s deal with BP has been the subject of numerous protests over the years, as part of a high-profile campaign against big oil’s involvement in the arts. Earlier this year, more than 300 archaeologists and historians wrote to the museum’s trustees calling on them to cut ties with the company, while activists presented fake “Stonehenge drilling plans” to visitors. In 2020 the museum was occupied for three days during its BP-sponsored Troy exhibition. The relationship between the British Museum and BP has also drawn condemnation from the museum’s staff and led in part to the resignation of one of its trustees, the novelist Ahdaf Soueif. Actors including Emma Thompson, Mark Ruffalo and Mark Rylance called on the museum’s director to drop BP as a commercial sponsor. Last month, the British Museum became the latest cultural organisation to remove the Sackler family name from its galleries and rooms. In recent years, the name has become toxic, with some branches of the family accused of making a profit from the US opioids crisis. A spokesperson for the museum said: “The British Museum receives funding from BP, a longstanding corporate partner, to support the museum’s mission and provide public benefit for a global audience through its support of our temporary exhibition programme. Without external support much programming and other major projects would not happen. The British Museum is grateful to all those who support its work in times of reduced funding.” The spokesperson said that the director and trustees “think carefully about the nature and quality of sponsorship before accepting”, adding: “The museum is run solely by its trustees and staff as set out in the British Museum Act 1963. All decisions are made by the trustees and staff through our governance structure and in the best interests of the museum as a charity.”",Arts/Culture,Climate and heritage experts call on British Museum to end BP sponsorship,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/19/climate-and-heritage-experts-call-on-british-museum-to-end-bp-sponsorship
4/19/2022,"Onshore windfarms need not blight the most beautiful parts of England because there is plenty of room for them next to rail lines and on brownfield land, leading scientists have said. The government decided to keep the curbs on onshore wind, introduced by David Cameron, in the recent energy strategy. This means that it will be difficult to expand onshore wind in England. It came after the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the turbines were an “eyesore”. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, emphasised his support for offshore wind but did not noticeably back onshore wind. Scientists have said that the contrast between policy in England and Scotland, which has devolved and less strict regulation of onshore windfarms, is made clear when travelling between the two countries. Dr David Toke, from the University of Aberdeen, said: “As you go from England to Scotland by road or rail you will notice a definite increase in the use of land close to transport corridors for windfarms. The rules effectively banning windfarms in England are unique to planning in the UK. They are a testament to the government’s political inability to mobilise this very cheap and clean source of renewable energy to reduce our energy bills.” Relaxed planning rules more akin to those in Scotland would not allow windfarms to be built in areas of outstanding natural beauty or other protected landscapes, researchers said. Dr Rebecca Windemer, a lecturer in environmental planning at the University of the West of England, said: “If the planning rules on windfarms in England are changed then designated landscapes that are traditionally regarded as beautiful, ie national parks, would remain protected by their designations. Also, as windfarms can only be developed in areas with adequate wind resources, we would not see windfarms being developed everywhere. “A revised planning policy should also give local communities the opportunity to say whether they feel that their local landscape is suitable for windfarms and to judge if the benefits outweigh the visual impact.” A recent study by scientists at the University of Sussex and Denmark’s Aarhus University has found that if windfarms were established on the available and appropriate land, they could meet 140% of the UK and Ireland’s energy demand. Although not all of this land would be used, in the interest of preserving biodiversity, the researchers said that the research showed how much potential onshore wind has to solve the energy crisis. Prof Peter Enevoldsen, who worked on the report, said: “Our study revealed that the UK and Ireland had the potential to generate 2,150 TWh of energy from onshore wind, assuming a realistic capacity factor of 28%, which was the mean capacity factor of onshore wind turbines in the UK in 2020.” He added that the UK and Ireland’s combined onshore and offshore wind generation in 2020 only met 4% of the onshore energy potential shown in the study. “Meeting the onshore potential would equal 140% of the UK and Ireland’s entire energy demand in 2020,” he said. However, onshore wind is being ignored by policymakers in favour of nuclear power. Co-author Benjamin Sovacool, a professor of energy policy at the University of Sussex Business School, said: “The study is not a blueprint for development but a guide for policymakers indicating the potential of how much more can be done and where the prime opportunities exist. Our study suggests that the horizon is bright for the onshore wind sector and that European aspirations for a 100% renewable energy grid are within our collective grasp technologically. “Obviously, we are not saying that we should install turbines in all the identified sites, but the study does show the huge wind power potential right across Europe which needs to be harnessed if we’re to avert a climate catastrophe.” Experts have also said that expanding onshore wind could empower communities by reducing their bills and giving them a stake in their local infrastructure. Jake Burnyeat, the managing director of Communities for Renewables CIC, said: “Onshore wind is low-cost generation – less than 5p per kilowatt-hour compared with 9p for nuclear and current wholesale electricity prices, which are more than 12p. Polls and citizens’ assemblies show broad public support for onshore wind. Given onshore wind is cheap and popular, why is the government preventing it in England? “If we are going to reintroduce onshore wind, how can the host communities benefit? Low-cost electricity is a good idea, but our energy market currently makes that very difficult. We think local communities should have a right to buy a meaningful share of any windfarm – maybe 20% or one in five turbines. The community could then use surplus income (after operating and finance costs) to fund net zero transition and fuel poverty projects in the surrounding locality. “The ‘right to buy’ should be at cost, so that the community can make surplus, and the local ownership should be by an asset-locked not-for-profit body with a local purpose. Rather than just offering cheap electricity, we’d like to see windfarms funding the low-energy retrofit of the houses surrounding them; providing long-term bill reductions and energy savings; and creating local jobs.”",News/Environment,Scientists urge government to relax England’s onshore windfarm rules,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/19/scientists-urge-government-to-relax-englands-onshore-windfarm-rules
4/19/2022,"Holding her phone at arm’s length, a crowd gathered behind her, Amreen Khan speaks into the camera. “Today, I am in Chandpura village,” she says, “where the government is trying to drive out residents from their homes, claiming the land belongs to the state.”Over the next few minutes, Khan details the story of this village in Chhatarpur district, Madhya Pradesh, where she found dozens of people at risk of losing their homes. It is the kind of social injustice that the former nursery school teacher has long wanted to bring to light, but didn’t know how. Now, newly graduated from India’s first digital journalism school for rural women, she knows exactly how to do it. “I always wanted to do something to improve the condition of my village. I finally feel like my dreams are coming true.”Khan, 35, is one of 270 women from villages in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar states who joined a pilot programme at Chambal Academy. The academy has sprung from the success of Khabar Lahariya, the rural, female-run news organisation that was the subject of award-winning documentary Writing with Fire in 2021. Khabar Lahariya employs 40 women. With the academy it will reach hundreds more women, teaching reporting skills, and also an awareness of digital security, fake news, social media and how to document the impact of global issues including the climate crisis on their communities.“We designed Chambal Academy’s training programme as an online-only platform to make it accessible to more women, who can do it from home on their mobile phone at their own pace,” says Suneeta Prajapati, 25, coordinator and the face of the academy’s video tutorials in Hindi.India is the second-largest online market in the world, with half of the projected 900 million active users by 2025 expected to come from rural areas, but women are at a huge disadvantage. According to government data, only 25% of women in rural areas have ever accessed the internet. Chambal Academy, which officially launches in May, is about tackling that gap, says Priya Thuvassery, director at Chambal Media. “We are not just building reporters but active digital consumers. It is about who has the power to tell stories. Through the academy, we can multiply our work at Khabar Lahariya and replicate this successful business model of storytelling through a gender, feminist and caste lens.” Before students are trained in writing news stories, the month-long course introduces the role of journalism in a democracy, and gender and caste biases in the media. “I learned that things that were normalised in our homes are actually discrimination against women,” says Khan, who is now reporting for Khabar Lahariya. Though her mother was initially opposed to her joining a male-dominated profession, her mother-in-law was supportive, encouraging her to report on issues such as the condition of local schools and gaps in education. “We need more women journalists in the field, so that the female population here is able to speak openly about the problems they face. What we bring to the table is empathy, relatability, a comfort level and a safe space for women to voice their concerns,” Khan says. Another graduate, Suman Diwakar, 28, from Banda in Uttar Pradesh, agrees: “Men have been telling stories through the male gaze, featuring the voices of powerful men. What about women’s perspectives and how issues affect them differently? Now we have a chance to forefront them through a feminist lens and the change those narratives can bring.” Diwakar says the training helped her overcome her shyness and gain the confidence she needs to push her way through a crowd to get interviews. “Through the course, I have found immense courage. I am not scared of anyone any more.

4/19/2022,"If you’re a millennial or have parented one, you know the look: advertisements with shirtless men, sculpted abs above low-cut jeans, a melange of thin and tan and young white bodies in minimal clothing. A store at the mall mostly obscured by heavy wooden blinders, music pulsing from within. Faded jeans and polo shirts in middle and high school, all featuring the ubiquitous moose. White Hot: The Rise & Fall of Abercrombie & Fitch, a new Netflix documentary on the ubiquity of a once zeitgeist-y brand’s limited vision of “cool” and its culture of discrimination, is easy catnip for adults re-evaluating the influences of their youth. The brand of barely there denim miniskirts and graphic T-shirts was “part of the landscape of what I thought it meant to be a young person”, the film’s director, Alison Klayman, told the Guardian. (Klayman, a millennial, grew up in Philadelphia.) That’s true for many US adolescents in the late 90s through the 2000s, as Abercrombie stores anchored most mainstream malls across America, including my hometown middle school hangout in the suburbs of Cincinnati, Ohio. Anytime Abercrombie comes up in conversation, “you immediately cut right to stories about people’s identity formation”, said Klayman. How much money you could or could not spend on clothing, body insecurities, memory imprints from hangouts at the mall. The overpowering smell of its cologne, Fierce, liberally applied to every surface. The messages one received on what was cool, on whose bodies met the right standards and whose did not. As White Hot traces through a succinct and wide-ranging survey of the brand’s evolution and sales tactics, Abercrombie & Fitch, a company hinged on a vision of “preppy cool”, kept those messages pretty overt. To quote former CEO Mike Jeffries, who oversaw the brand’s precipitous rise in the late 90s and 2000s, in a now infamous interview from 2006: “We go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong [in our clothes], and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.” Translation: a brand that was “white hot” not only in a financial sense, during a period of cultural ubiquity at the turn of the millennium, but also one that promoted, internally and externally, an exclusively white vision of beauty and style. That “all-American” is doing a lot. (The brand also famously refused to carry plus sizes for years, until after Jeffries departed in 2014.) As White Hot recounts through first-person interviews with several former staff members and cultural academics, this is a brand that once sold graphic tees branded with a racist depiction of Asian people and the words “two Wongs can make it white”. The brand that, in corporate materials, banned store staff from having dreadlocks, that ranked employees on appearance and skin tone, faced a class action racial discrimination case in the early 2000s and argued before the supreme court in 2015 that it was legal to deny employment to a woman with a headscarf because the religious garment violated its “look policy”. (The company lost in a 8-1 ruling.) The 88-minute film offers its fair share of nostalgia bait – the opening sequence plays alongside Lit’s My Own Worst Enemy, and the signature scent is subject to plenty of good-natured ribbing – but focuses on taking scalpel to the company’s finely tuned, if now stale, image. “We wanted to focus on the everyday people who were affected by this company,” said Klayman. Taking a more objective look at Abercrombie offered the opportunity to examine “abstract forces that impact us in life, things like beauty standards or structural racism”, and peek behind the curtain to see “exactly how this was a top-down system that relied on existing biases”. That system, the film explains, was both a reflection of American culture and executed under the exacting watch of Jeffries, who took over as CEO in the early 1990s. The Abercrombie & Fitch name was established (as the shirts often boasted) in 1893 as an elite sportsman’s store (think a Teddy Roosevelt-esque gentleman hunter). It became the famous moose polo version after retail magnate and Jeffrey Epstein financier Les Wexner purchased it, moved its headquarters to Columbus, Ohio, and handed the reins to Jeffries. It was Jeffries – a mercurial and reclusive figure who declined to participate in the film – who masterminded Abercrombie’s transformation into a clothing brand that united Calvin Klein sexy and Ralph Lauren Americana, sold at aspirational but accessible prices, marketed primarily to adolescents. Jeffries was, by numerous accounts from former corporate employees in the film, demanding, obsessed with youth and a micro-manager who emphasized appearance – as in, thinness, whiteness and Eurocentric features – at the company’s stores. In 2003, under Jeffries, the company faced a class action racial discrimination lawsuit from California which alleged that the company turned down minorities for sales positions, relegated them to stockrooms, and had their hours reduced when managers heard their looks weren’t Abercrombie enough. (Three of the class-action plaintiffs testify to such discrimination, and its emotional damage, in the film.) The company settled the lawsuit for $50m without admitting wrongdoing. As part of the deal, Abercrombie & Fitch was subject to a consent decree and required to hire a diversity officer – Todd Corley, who appears in the film but defers from revealing his full opinions on the brand’s controversies. As White Hot explains, the consent decree had no enforcement mechanism, and though representation increased behind the scenes, the brand’s exclusionary vision under Jeffries continued. “Discrimination was their brand,” says Benjamin O’Keefe, who started a viral petition to boycott the brand in 2013 until they made their clothing for teens of all sizes. “They rooted themselves in discrimination at every single level.” Jeffries certainly meets the “eccentric bad CEO” criteria now popular in TV shows, from WeCrashed to The Dropout to Super Pumped, and its depictions of millennial hustle culture (“Abercrombie was definitely doing work hard, play hard,” said Klayman.) But as titillating as it can be to focus on his oddities (his comically exaggerated plastic surgeries, for example), such focus can end up being “exculpatory”, said Klayman. “It kind of lets all of us, the collective, off the hook, not to mention the entire company that was facilitating this exclusionary vision for decades. “It’s really convenient to put all the sins on Mike [Jeffries] and that era because he was so closely associated with the company’s rebirth in the 90s and early aughts,” she said. “And he definitely deserves real criticism, but it takes more than one guy to do what A&F did.” Since Jeffries left in 2014, the company has changed tack. Under CEO Fran Horowitz, appointed in 2017, the company’s sales have rebounded from its mid-2010s nadir and a rebrand of its image to one of inclusivity, one more in line with the politics of Gen Z. “We run a company very focused on diversity and inclusion,” Horowitz has said. The company has developed a cult following for its Curve Love jeans in a range of sizes. Their marketing now “puts them in line with what good business looks like today”, said Klayman. But “it’s important to talk about it holistically, and I don’t know how much they’ve truly reckoned with their past”. That reckoning, the film ultimately argues, goes beyond a corporate rebrand; the brand was not so much exceptional as illustrative. It was not the pioneer of exclusivity nor whiteness but, for a time, one of the best at profiting on it – which, to be fair, is pretty classically all-American.
