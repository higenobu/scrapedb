2/5/2022,"Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor says Meta should have stayed around longer in the crypto space. ""The mistake [they made] was not getting into the crypto space. They wasted many, many years of their time with the project they invested in,"" the MicroStrategy CEO and founder said on Yahoo Finance Live. This week, Diem — Facebook's one-time crypto venture — said it sold its assets and intellectual property to crypto bank Silvergate Capital. Sale price: $182 million. The sale effectively ends Facebook's push into the crypto space as it focuses resources on building out the metaverse. Adds Saylor, ""They have not embraced bitcoin. That is the problem."" Well, that is one problem indeed in terms of Meta's lack of diversification, which could have been helped by a push into crypto. The other ones being Apple iOS privacy changes and the surging TikTok, as seen through the prism of a shockingly bad fourth quarter and outlook from Meta. Facebook added just 2 million monthly active users in the quarter, barely moving the needle from the prior quarter. In the third quarter, the platform added 15 million monthly active users. Daily active users fell by 1 million. Operating profit margins in the Family of Apps segment declined 600 basis points from the prior year. Meta shares were rocked to the tune of 25% on Thursday's session. The company warned the Apple iOS changes would hit revenue by a whopping $10 billion this year. ""There is now a dramatic fundamentals gap between Google and Facebook. And one could argue that Facebook is now facing a Netflix-like negative inflection point,"" warned EvercoreISI tech analyst Mark Mahaney.

2/5/2022,"ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — The United States on Thursday delivered two Black Hawk military helicopters to Croatia, which is engaged in a mini arms race with neighboring Russian ally Serbia amid simmering tensions in the post-war Balkan region. The U.S. Embassy in Croatia’s capital, Zagreb, said the donated UH-60M multi-purpose helicopters will contribute to Croatia’s growing defense capabilities and military preparedness in support of NATO. “The Black Hawk provides capabilities across a range of possible missions, from special operations to tactical troop transport to aeromedical evacuation,” U.S. Chargé d’Affaires Mark Fleming said as the helicopters arrived on a U.S. Air Force transport plane to Zagreb. “Croatia has earned a reputation as a committed and capable NATO ally, and the introduction of Black Hawks will further boost the capacities of the Croatian Armed Forces,” Fleming said in the statement. Defense Minister Mario Banozic thanked the U.S. for the donation. ""It represents evidence of strong, friendly and allied relations, which are progressing every year,” he said. Croatia last month reached an agreement with the U.S. to buy 89 Bradley fighting vehicles as part of cooperation with Washington and plans as a member of NATO to form an infantry brigade. Croatia, which is also a member of the European Union, last year agreed to purchase 12 Rafale fighter jets from France. Serbia, which was at war with Croatia in the 1990s over its secession from the Serb-led Yugoslavia, has lately been arming itself mostly with Russian and Chinese warplanes, drones, and anti-aircraft systems. In recent months, Russia has handed over to Serbia 30 battle tanks and 30 armored personnel carriers. Serbia has also recently purchased sophisticated Russian Pantsir air defense systems, as well as attack and transport helicopters and Chinese drones. Although formally seeking EU membership, Serbia has refused to fully align its foreign policies with the 27-nation bloc and has worked on strengthening its relations with Russia and China in parallel. With Croatia firmly standing by its NATO allies in the current tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Serbia said it will remain neutral.",World/Associated Press,"US gives military helicopters to Croatia, Russia arms Serbs",https://news.yahoo.com/us-gives-military-helicopters-croatia-163708651.html
