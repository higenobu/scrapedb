1/3/2022,"Several hospitals in Lincolnshire have declared a “critical incident” over “extreme and unprecedented” staff shortages. The United Lincolnshire hospitals NHS trust (ULHT), which includes four hospitals across the county, told its sites it was unable to maintain safe staffing levels, leading to “compromised care”.  An internal memo dated Sunday, leaked to the media, said the biggest factor was the rapid increase in staff sickness across two of its sites, Lincoln county hospital in Lincoln and Pilgrim hospital in Boston. Figures showed the number of staff members absent because they were ill or quarantining with Covid-19 had doubled in the month before Christmas, with 150 staff isolating on Boxing Day. The trust insisted “essential services remain fully open for anyone who needs them” as it urged people “to come forward for care” if they needed. The memo said the increasing numbers of Covid-positive patients was also adding to the pressure, with “a number of nosocomial infections on some ward areas” – people who had caught Covid since being admitted to hospital. Staff ratios have been increased – the number of patients each nurse looks after – and NHS staff are being asked to volunteer to work extra hours. The memo reiterated its “full support to those taking a risk-balanced approach to patient care at this difficult time”. One of the largest acute hospital trusts in England, ULH includes Lincoln county hospital, Grantham and district hospital, Pilgrim hospital in Boston and County hospital Louth. In a statement, ULHT’s medical director, Dr Colin Farquharson, said: “As a result of significant staffing pressures due to absence related to Covid-19, we are having to take additional steps to maintain services. “Our staff continue to work exceptionally hard and we would like to reassure our patients and the public that in spite of the challenges faced, essential services remain fully open for anyone who needs them, so people should continue to come forward for care.” He added that people could help by getting their Covid booster vaccine “to protect themselves and their families and reduce pressure on health services”.",News/Society,Lincolnshire hospitals declare ‘critical incident’ over staff shortages,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/03/lincolnshire-hospitals-declare-critical-incident-over-staff-shortages
1/3/2022,"Fifty years ago, the entire Creole population of the Chagos Islands were forcibly removed from their own homes by British forces in order to make way for a US military base. Families were torn apart, scattered between the Seychelles and Mauritius, where they endured enormous economic hardships and discrimination. In Olivier Magis’ documentary, the horrors of those nights are painfully alive. Over atmospheric shots of rippling ocean waves we hear shocking first-person accounts of people throwing themselves overboard and small babies dying during these arduous journeys. Sabrina, a second-generation Chagosian exile, carries this startlingly recent legacy on her indefatigable shoulders as she fights for the rights of her people to return to their homeland. Perpetually displaced, many of the Chagosian refugees currently living in England face insurmountable financial precariousness and get little state support. Their fervent protests outside the House of Lords also seem to fall on deaf ears: in 2016 the UK government decided against a resettlement of the islands, citing monetary costs.  While Sabrina’s campaign is hampered by endless obstacles, moments of solidarity shine through; a major section of the film is dedicated to the camaraderie of a Chagosian football team who participate in the 2016 World Cup for stateless and diaspora groups. As a Chagosian song is played before a match, it not only rouses the spirit of the young athletes but also becomes a searing proclamation of statehood. There are some clumsy formal choices – Sabrina’s meetings with activists in the US are inexplicably scored to a jazzy improvisation – but this film is a damning reminder of a cruel imperialist intervention whose ramifications remain largely unfamiliar to the general public.

1/3/2022," In my first class on an archaeology course at Lund University in Sweden, I stood out more than usual. It was not just that it was full of blond and blue-eyed students, more than in any other class I had ever attended – it was that archaeology is not a field that many migrants study.  My teacher and classmates were lovely, yet I still had this feeling of “What am I, a Somali refugee, doing here?” Furthermore, I had never even seen an archaeologist before, or held an archaeological object. But I had read a sentence in a book (Africa: history of a continent, by Basil Davidson) which said that to write African history we need to do archaeological research. As this first class was on European stone age archaeology, stone implements were handed out. An axe was passed to me. To my astonishment the label read “Somaliland”. Wow: an axe from my own country. The moment was like a message. It was as if someone was saying to me: “Yes, you belong in this classroom”. I bombarded our teacher with questions about the axe. He had no idea where it was from – he did not seem to care. Why would he? Stone age artefacts are mostly the same. No, he did not think there was any further documentation: only that they were palaeolithic objects. I later discovered that these objects were extraordinary. It turns out the axes were in fact history-making implements, taken out of my country in the exciting days when the idea of human evolution was taking shape. Fast-forward 20 years from that day in Lund and I’m creating a new global initiative, a digital museum to bring together in one platform all Somali objects and materials. I want people across Africa to feel the same connection to the subject as I did. In archaeology, context is everything: if your bones are found with those of extinct bears and mammoths, then you’ve probably been dead for tens of thousands of years and are most likely not even a Homo sapiens. In 1856 the first Neanderthal was discovered in Neander Valley in Germany. The Neanderthal would understandably not have liked to be thought of as the only link between modern humans and the great apes – they were too sophisticated. So it must have been a relief when, in the 1890s, Homo erectus came into the picture. The Java man, as this find came to be known, was labelled the “missing link”. Soon this “upright-ape-man” was joined by more hominids discovered in Asia. These discoveries reinforced the theories of Charles Darwin, first set out in 1859 in On the Origin of Species, and his idea of natural selection gained more ground. This was further evidence for the idea that humans had evolved from one common ancestor. Archaeologists didn’t bother to look to Africa until 1896, when Heywood Walter Seton-Karr, a Scottish game hunter, returned to London with hundreds of stone implements from British Somaliland. He proclaimed, to global attention, that he had found the garden of Eden: “Here it was, in my opinion, that the human race originated.” Major museums – one of which must have been the Lund natural history museum – lined up to acquire Somaliland artefacts, including stone tools. More discoveries on the continent followed, such as Kenya’s “Turkana boy” or Ethiopia’s “Lucy”. I have spent the past year surveying the same area where Seton-Karr stumbled on the stone axes. I asked village elders about him, hoping for some lingering generational memory. And though the name did not ring a bell – why should it – they told me the Ingriiskii (the British) used to come looking for macdan (gems) here. Often, foreign archaeological missions failed to tell the locals what they were really doing – indeed sometimes this still happens. The village chief vowed to me to protect his area, which also includes newly located 5,000-year-old rock paintings. By uncovering the hidden history of African collections long forgotten in museums in the west, the founders of our new archive have unearthed a wealth of art, technology and human history. With the application of technology, things of the past can come alive – through photogrammetry and 3D virtual tours – and feel more relevant to modern-day societies. We are collaborating with major western museums that hold African collections, including a number of UK institutions (the British Museum and Powell-Cotton Museum among them). But with all our digital work being carried out by African local teams, we are tapping into a new tech-savvy generation. The idea is to inspire Africans to be the owners of their heritage and its narratives. This is not just about the past. Our fast-growing demands for goods have put huge pressure on climate and resources and also made us forget our traditional ways of resource management and interacting with nature. One of the most extraordinary individuals we worked with was a blind potter. She had been trained by her mother who was in turn trained by her mother. Now she was with her own daughter who was training her daughters. This lineage of female potters will die out after surviving so many adversities just because so many people now opt for machine-produced pottery and imported plastic goods. Our museum aims to revitalise craft technologies such as pottery and iron-making. With objects often locally neglected, or forgotten in the storage departments of major museums, this heritage is at risk for the first time in history. If we do not bring together the people and stories that reflect what is most beautiful about human life – the ability to adapt to change and challenges – we may well lose sight of humanity itself.

1/3/2022,"The Mower’s Song My mind was once the true surveyOf all these meadows fresh and gay,And in the greenness of the grassDid see its hopes as in a glass;When Juliana came, and sheWhat I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me.  But these, while I with sorrow pine,Grew more luxuriant still and fine,That not one blade of grass you spy’dBut had a flower on either side;When Juliana came, and sheWhat I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me. Unthankful meadows, could you soA fellowship so true forgo?And in your gaudy May-games meetWhile I lay trodden under feet?When Juliana came, and sheWhat I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me. But what you in compassion ought,Shall now by my revenge be wrought;And flow’rs, and grass, and I and all,Will in one common ruin fall.For Juliana comes, and sheWhat I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me. And thus, ye meadows, which have beenCompanions of my thoughts more green,Shall now the heraldry becomeWith which I shall adorn my tomb;For Juliana comes, and sheWhat I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me. The Mower’s Song is one of four “Mower” poems by Andrew Marvell (1621-1678), complementing his most substantial work in the country house genre, Upon Appleton House. All date from the period he spent at Nun Appleton House (1651-2) as tutor to Mary, the daughter of Lord General Thomas Fairfax. The English civil war and the impending first Anglo-Dutch war enrich Marvell’s view of Arcadia. Lord Fairfax had laid out the gardens at Appleton “in the Figure of a Fort”. Upon Appleton House develops a brilliantly extended metaphor of the horticultural battleground, producing one of the most unusual and moving anti-war meditations of any age. Images of wounding, physical and psychological, recur in the Mower quartet. Perhaps Damon the Mower provides the most relevant and helpful context here. Damon, in love with Juliana (whose name is associated with July and thus the high summer heat of Damon’s desires) suffers not only the flames of love but accidentally wounds himself in the ankle with his own scythe. The theme of being “mown down” by love might suggest satire (for which Marvell certainly had no little talent) but its treatment is scarcely light-hearted, any more than the Mower is simply a figure of rustic innocence. The Mower imposes his will on nature like the more sophisticated, commercially motivated horticulturalist excoriated in The Mower Against Gardens. Intrinsic to banishment from Eden, the war between nature and unnaturally greedy humanity further infects the vision of the garden as redemptive pastoral. Lost clarity of understanding is proclaimed by the Mower in the first verse of his song, where the noun “survey” suggests a once informed, rational perception of the landscape. His hopes have similarly been decimated. The meadows are the subject of the second stanza, flourishing with new spring grass and a proliferation of wild flowers. Envious of the “gaudy May-games” the singer turns on these “unthankful meadows”, addressing them directly in stanza three. He goes on to declare that he will vengefully enforce the meadows’ withheld “compassion” (they should have wilted in sympathy with the lover) and ensure that “flow’rs, and grass, and I and all, / Will in one common ruin fall.” Marvell’s refrain suggests, perhaps, a rustic style of diction. The grammatical jolt between the two lines, “For Juliana comes, and she / What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me”, brings the violence of the scythe into the syntax, and turns the poem away from any potential comedy. Juliana’s verb, “came”, changes tense as the poem continues, while the narrative remains in the present continuous. When “came” shifts to “comes” in the last two stanzas, we can imagine the mower’s grass-like trembling at the approach of footsteps. In the final line of the refrain’s couplet, the two half-lines seem to swing like a scythe, the separating comma suggesting the pause between one keen stroke and another. Lightest of the Mower poems, The Mower’s Song still leaves us in no doubt about the speaker’s sense of devastation, and that these represent the general state of the fallen human world and its relationships. For a detailed examination of the Mower poems and their relation to Marvell’s other work, this thesis is well worth a look.",Arts/Books,Poem of the week: The Mower’s Song by Andrew Marvell,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/03/poem-of-the-week-the-mowers-song-by-andrew-marvell
