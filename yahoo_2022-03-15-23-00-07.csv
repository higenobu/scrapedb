3/15/2022,"Spencer Platt The image of 31-year-old Eva Lopez was falsely used in a wanted poster by the New York Police Department back in August. Now, the Instagram influencer is suing the department for $30 million. NYPD officials had been searching for a “thieving” prostitute when the mix-up occurred, according to the New York Post. The escort in question was reportedly involved in a theft incident at an East Village apartment, where she was accused of stealing a $13,000 Rolex and Chase credit card. On Aug. 16, Lopez said that she and her boyfriend were coming back from Florida when she received a startling text from a friend about the wanted poster, court records revealed. “I thought it was something fake. I really couldn’t believe the police would put me on a wanted poster,” she recalled. Initially, Lopez didn’t think anything of the mistake until her boss urged her to notify the NYPD about the error. Lopez contacted the 9th Precinct, where a detective named Kevin Dwyer, appeared to have been already notified about the bogus wanted poster. According to court filings, he “knew it was an issue before she called.” Dwyer reassured Lopez that the wrongfully used poster had been taken down, but sadly, the image had already begun to circulate across social media. “…. It was still being passed around, still being talked about, still making me look like a thief and a prostitute,” Lopez told The Post, noting that on Facebook the false image had been shared over 10,000, 20,000 times. The poster also appeared on Instagram where the young woman boasts a large following of nearly 862,000. In the photo, Lopez wore a sexy tube top, high heels, and tight leggings. Lopez said she was dressed up for her friend’s birthday party in the image used. The poster bore the words “Wanted for Grand Larceny,” along with “Perpetrator — probable cause to arrest.” Lopez vehemently denied the allegations, telling the publication that she had never had a prior history of arrests and had never engaged in prostitution work.  Since the image went viral, Lopez said the damaging situation has impacted her ability to work. “People didn’t think I was being honest. It was just really, really embarrassing, not only for me but for my family as well.” she added. “I just really want people to know that’s not me, in any way, shape or form. The girl has nothing to do with me.” Dwyer and the NYPD declined to comment about the suit to The Post.

3/15/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — The U.S. says Russia has asked China to provide military assistance for its war in Ukraine, and that China has responded affirmatively. Both Moscow and Beijing have denied the allegation, with a Chinese spokesperson dismissing it as “disinformation.” Still, the claims have generated conjecture over how far Beijing would be willing to go in backing its “most important strategic partner,” as China’s foreign minister recently described Russia. WHAT DID THE U.S. SAY? Following initial reports that Russia had asked China for military aid, unnamed U.S. officials said that Washington had determined that China had sent a signal to Russia: Beijing would be willing to provide both military support for the campaign in Ukraine and financial backing to help stave off the impact of severe sanctions imposed by the West. At a meeting in Rome on Monday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi against providing such support, even as the Kremlin denied requesting military equipment. The U.S. is wary of China's intentions because the government of President Xi Jinping has refused to criticize the Russian invasion, even as it seeks to distance itself from the Kremlin's war by calling for dialogue and reiterating its position that a nation's territory must be respected. WHAT MIGHT CHINA OFFER? If anything, smaller items such as bullets and meals are more likely than fighter jets and tanks, experts said. China “probably wants to avoid high-profile or big-ticket arms sales to Russia in the midst of a conflict which would expose Beijing to international sanctions,” said Drew Thompson, a former U.S. Defense Department official currently at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. Beijing would be more willing to provide spare parts, consumables, ammunition, and dual-use items that don’t contravene sanctions and could fall below the threshold of international reprisals, Thompson said. For example, Russian helicopters are likely using up their flares to counter portable short-range missiles like the Stinger. China could conceivably sell Russia some of its flares, if they are compatible with Russian systems, Thompson said. China might also share surveillance and intelligence, he said. Given Washington’s warnings, any Chinese aid would likely involve “very basic stuff,” such as ration packs for soldiers, said Sam Roggeveen, director of the International Security Program at Australia’s Lowy Institute. He added that Russia would find it virtually impossible to integrate Chinese armaments into its armed forces on such short notice. WOULD CHINA DO IT? While not impossible, both Chinese and non-Chinese experts say there are several factors working against it. For starters, it could look bad. “China will be very careful trying its best to avoid its aid and other assistance being used on the battlefields of Ukraine,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. He added that China “has no motive to provide any assistance to Russia’s operation in Ukraine.” Roggeveen concurred that there is no “obvious upside” for China in aiding Moscow, adding that a weakened Russia could work to China’s strategic and economic advantage. Chinese officials have also said throughout the crisis that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all countries should be respected — though critics say its refusal to criticize Russia's invasion is in fundamental contradiction to that position. “Russia’s military operation in Ukraine has in nature become an invasion, and China will never provide arms to help a country attack another sovereign county and that is not in accordance with international law,” said Li Xin, director of the Institute of European and Asian Studies at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. China also does not want to see the conflict worsen or be dragged in as a co-belligerent, so any Chinese support “would be measured and carefully calibrated,” Thompson said.",World/Associated Press,EXPLAINER: How plausible is Chinese military aid for Russia?,https://news.yahoo.com/explainer-plausible-chinese-military-aid-092727148.html
3/15/2022,"A Republican group is running an ad on Fox News that calls out members of the GOP who recognize the danger of Donald Trump but plan to vote for him if he’s the party’s nominee in 2024. The spot from the Republican Accountability Project is meant to resemble the old ASPCA ads featuring singer Sarah McLachlan. Except instead of a plea to help animals escape abusive environments, this one’s a mock PSA for Republicans suffering from “Partisan Derangement Syndrome” who are “too far gone” to be saved: The ad is set to run nationally on “Fox & Friends” next week ― reportedly one of Trump’s favorite shows. “This ad shows the ridiculous lengths these Republicans will go to try to remain in Trump’s good graces,” Sarah Longwell, the organization’s executive director, said in a news release. “They know Trump’s lies about the 2020 election and actions on January 6 were wrong, but they lack the courage to take a stand and say they won’t support him.” The Republican Accountability Project, a group of “never Trump” conservatives, has been calling out members of the GOP who enabled the former president, especially during and after the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol that was carried out by his supporters. The group has taken out ads against House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) and others, and has vowed to support candidates who challenge Trump’s enablers in the primaries.

3/15/2022,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - The prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia were travelling to Kyiv by train on Tuesday to show support for the country on behalf of the EU, the first foreign leaders to visit the Ukrainian capital since Russia invaded last month. Kyiv has been under Russian attacks: two powerful explosions rocked the capital before dawn on Tuesday. Emergency services said two people died when an apartment building was struck. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Facebook the trip took place on the 20th day of Russian President Vladimir Putin's Putin's ""criminal aggression against Ukraine"". ""At such breakthrough times for the world, it is our duty to be where history is forged. Because it's not about us, but about the future of our children who deserve to live in a world free from tyranny,"" he said. Top aide to Morawiecki, Michal Dwoczyk, told reporters the delegation had crossed the Polish-Ukraine border by train after 8 a.m. (0700 GMT). ""The purpose of the visit is to confirm the unequivocal support of the entire European Union for the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,"" Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said in a statement also released by the Polish government. ""The aim of this visit is also to present a broad package of support for Ukraine and Ukrainians."" Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa was also taking part in the trip, which Fiala said was taken in consultation with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The idea of the trip was agreed at an EU leaders' summit in Versailles in France last week, Dworczyk said. Morawiecki was to be joined by Polish Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the country's ruling PiS party. The Czech Republic and Poland, former communist members of both the EU and NATO, have been among the strongest backers of Ukraine in Europe since the Russian invasion. Russia calls its actions a ""special military operation"" to ""denazify"" Ukraine, which Kyiv and its Western allies reject as a pretext for an unjustified and illegal attack.
