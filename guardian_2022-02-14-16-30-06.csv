2/14/2022,"The home affairs department paid $16,000 to a senior official to rent his house through Airbnb for staff who needed to quarantine after returning from overseas. The deal was part of a $522,000 program to accommodate returning staff and comply with Australian Capital Territory Covid quarantine requirements.  In Senate estimates on Monday the Labor senator Raff Ciccone said it was “mind-blowing” the department rented a house from the unnamed first assistant secretary on the basis it was the only suitable property available. But departmental secretary, Michael Pezzullo, defended the official’s conduct as “proper” because he identified the conflict of interest and offered to opt out of the program. According to officials, the department intended to use accommodation at the Australian National University for quarantine from September 2021, but was advised by ACT Health on 23 August to find alternatives. The deputy secretary, Justine Saunders, said that the department contacted owners of suitable properties through Airbnb “without knowing who the owners of the properties were”. Only “freestanding houses” were considered suitable under ACT guidelines, Pezzullo said, and there were “no other properties available” that fit the bill, according to Saunders. After he was contacted by a government department to rent his house, the home affairs officer contacted a senior member of the department to seek advice in relation to a conflict of interest, said Saunders. Pezzullo said: “The officer in question … went out of his way to suggest ‘this is going to be an issue in Estimates and elsewhere – best if I don’t participate in the program’. I think that’s exemplary conduct.” But due to the lack of accommodation available at short notice, the department proceeded with the rental, paying $15,981 to rent the employee’s property from 12 September to 30 November. Pezzullo said he had inquired into the contract and he was satisfied that “unless something else comes to my notice there was proper conduct engaged in”. Pezzullo said that if the officer attempted to disguise the transaction, or had not drawn it to the department’s attention, or had not offered to opt out of the program, he “might have a similarly jaundiced view” of it as Ciccone, but “those conditions aren’t apparent”. In total, 72 federal government officials including ministerial staffers returning from overseas were housed at a cost of $522,067. The department gave details of 18 properties ranging from one at Kaleen costing $155 a night to a $390-a-night rental in Kambah, but declined to identify which was owned by the first assistant secretary. Saunders said the department “explored hotels and apartments knowing they would be lower cost options, but they weren’t agreed by the ACT government due to the higher Covid risk”. “The other option we explored was … for officers to share facilities, noting they were homes – that wasn’t agreed to in all instances,” she said. “So as a result of our understanding of the demand, and meeting ACT government requirements, the option that was agreed to by the ACT government and home affairs as the most suitable was properties that could be identified through Airbnb.”",News/Australia news,"Home affairs department paid $16,000 to rent senior official’s ACT home through Airbnb",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/14/home-affairs-department-paid-16000-to-rent-senior-officials-act-home-through-airbnb
2/14/2022,"Underdogs win Super Bowls by creating turnovers, playing clean and entering the fourth quarter within a score with a quarterback capable of creating some off-script magic. The Bengals hit on all three on Sunday. The game was right there for Cincinnati to close out. Then the Rams’ stars took over, and the flaws in a far-from-flawless Cincinnati roster were ultimately exposed – with a dose of help (as ever) from the league’s officials. The Bengals couldn’t tackle Cooper Kupp, at least not in time. And they could not block Aaron Donald, who led a defensive front that wound up dropping Joe Burrow seven times, a Super Bowl record. Sean McVay coached his Rams team into a hole, and his players dragged him out.  What now for Burrow and the Bengals? There is a feeling when a new team rises that they will be plenty more chances for them to win a Super Bowl. Once they break through, it is believed, they will continue to do so as long as the foundations remain in place. “We’re a young team,” Burrow said after the game on Sunday. “You like to think that we’ll be back in this situation multiple times over the course of the next few years. We’ll take this and let it fuel [us] for the rest of our careers.” By any objective measure, the Bengals are primed for long-term success. They have one of the most promising, young rosters in the league – an all-world wide receiver room and talent dripping all over the defense. In Burrow, they have one of the NFL’s most valuable building blocks: a true franchise quarterback who can elevate average players into difference-makers. They head into the offseason with the third-highest amount of cap space in the league and a bevy of draft picks with which to try to upgrade a roster with obvious defects. This was not a team that was perfectly constructed to challenge for this title. They were two to three years ahead of schedule, at minimum. Only two quarterbacks in the salary cap era have been selected first overall in the draft and guided the team that drafted them to a Super Bowl: Peyton and Eli Manning. On average, it takes seven years. Burrow took the Bengals to the promised land in two. Burrow posted the second most valuable season of any quarterback in the league by EPA, a measure of a player’s down to down efficiency. He led crucial come-from-behind victories and piloted the team through the playoffs. And he did so while playing behind a gaggle of saloon doors. Burrow was pressured on nearly 40% of his dropbacks over the course of the season. The Bengals’ finished 30th in the league in pressure rate, the lowest ranking for any team that has reached the Super Bowl since such records began. Few quarterbacks have ever done so much with so little help. An MVP-caliber quarterback on a rookie-scale deal represents the greatest market inefficiency in the NFL. Land someone like Burrow and you’re able to reshuffle, re-enforce and beef up the roster in all three phases, adding depth and top-tier talent through free agency. Burrow and his receivers wreaked havoc over some of the league’s finest defenses in just their second season together. Can you imagine what they will do when Burrow gets some protection? What about if a Bengals defense loaded with B-pluses could sprinkle some stardust on its secondary? Sunday should, by all indications, be the first waypoint on a trip to championships, plural. But NFL championship windows are always shorter than anyone anticipates. Teams splinter. They become mired in cap hell. They lose key contributors, get sapped by injuries, or fall prey to the Disease of Me. Cam Newton’s Panthers disintegrated in record time. Russell Wilson and the Seahawks have not been back to a championship game since losing on the one-yard line in Glendale in 2015. Aaron Rodgers has not been to the Super Bowl in more than 10 years, and may retire with only one title to his name. The Bengals have cracks. Head coach Zac Taylor was not presiding over a 13-win juggernaut, rather a 10-win team that snuck into the playoffs on the back of a pair of late-game comebacks, then rolled past a pair of competent-to-bad teams in the playoffs, before upsetting the Chiefs with a one-off, second-half masterplan. Everything had to go right just to make the final dance. The path to the Super Bowl through the AFC next season and beyond is sticky. Even with fresh additions, the Bengals will trail the Chiefs and Bills as the favorites in the conference. Then there’s Justin Herbert and the Chargers to worry about, and Lamar Jackson and the Ravens. The league’s top, young quarterbacks are all concentrated in the same conference – and that’s without factoring in the looming specter of trades for Wilson, Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, and perhaps even Kyler Murray. For the next 10 years or more, the path to the Super Bowl in the AFC will run through the best and brightest that the league’s most important position has to offer. And there are only so many seasons and championship berths to go around. In the immediate aftermath of a Super Bowl defeat, it’s natural to look forward. To think of the next opportunity, the next shot at a title. But winning is hard. It requires skill and luck, for your starting right guard to stay healthy and your secondary to coalesce in time for the postseason; to find four quality pass-rushers, and your holder not to bobble any snaps. All the little things went Cincinnati’s way throughout the postseason, but they ran out of the players to push them over the line at the very end. Burrow and the Bengals should be back. But it’s hard to imagine a team getting a better crack to win the whole thing than leading late in the fourth with a quality defense against an ailing, stale offense. Two things can be true: the Bengals are years ahead of schedule; they missed a crucial opportunity to win it all. One final stop, one more explosive play, and the Bengals would be champions. Now, they’re back on the merry-go-round with everyone else.",Sport/Sport,Burrow’s Bengals are a great young team.

2/14/2022,"Ahidden forest of algae sponges and hydroids photographed at low tide; a stunning night image of green button polyps under ultraviolet light; and a beautiful shot of a honeycomb moray eel stuck on a ledge on a rocky shore. Mumbai may be a bustling metropolis, but photographer Sarang Naik’s aesthetic and vibrant images of marine life show a different side of the city. When Naik first started exploring the coast of urban Mumbai, India’s financial capital and home to Bollywood stars, he was astounded by the diversity of creatures that he came across – from hermit crabs, barnacles and a baby octopus to zoanthids (colourful disc-shaped relatives of coral) and prickly sea urchins. The intertidal zone or foreshore – where the land is exposed at low tide and is under water at high tide – is home to diverse marine life over different terrains, from mudflats to beaches and mangroves.  “Most of my images have the creatures against the city in the background, reminding us that these creatures have been here way before us,” says Naik. “Even after three years of taking these shore walks, I am often blown away by the sight of some new coral or rare species. You don’t expect this kind of biodiversity in this concrete jungle.” Clockwise from top: a honeycomb moray eel stranded at low tide at Breach Candy; a nudibranch sea slug on coralline algae; zoanthids glowing in UV Light at Malabar Hill rocky shore; squid babies inside an egg mass; an Elysia sea slug feeding on algae in a tide pool Naik, who was born in the city, is a member of the Marine Life of Mumbai (MLOM), a collective of volunteers, marine biologists and enthusiasts co-founded by Pradip Patade, who played on Girgaum Chowpatty beach in southern Mumbai as a child. After he quit his job in human resources, Patade started teaching water sports and would walk along the shore taking pictures of the creatures he found there. He started MLOM with Abhishek Jamalabad, a marine biologist and certified diver, and Siddharth Chakravarty, an independent researcher in industrial fisheries, in February 2017. Exploring Juhu Beach at low tide Members upload their findings to iNaturalist, a biodiversity database accessed by expertsand have logged more than 484 species to date. MLOM’s Instagram page has records of sightings from common hairy crabs to pistol shrimp, nassa mud snails and even portuguese man o’ war. An octopus at Juhu Beach Jamalabad, who was born and raised in Mumbai, believes the intertidal zone has been largely neglected, not only in India, but across the world. “This is ironic because it’s one of the most accessible of all marine habitats and has a multitude of unique creatures. It also plays an important part in the ecology and lifecycle of creatures which live in the deeper parts of the ocean. “The Indian Ocean squid, a commercially important species, breeds and lays its eggs in the intertidal zone. Many reef fish spend their juvenile period in this zone to avoid predatory creatures. Many fishermen not only depend on the high seas for their catch but also on the intertidal zone. Oyster picking is restricted to this zone and is a female-dominated occupation, unlike fishing. It is also important for the physical integrity of the coast, as it keeps it safe from the impact of storms,” he says. Sejal Mehta, editor at MLOM, says that the resilience of the creatures found on Mumbai’s shores is constantly surprising. “As I started discovering the shores on different walks, from Haji Ali to Nepean Sea Road, what hit me was how prolific the marine life was in spite of all the plastic, sewage and marine pollution. It reminded me of the resilience of Mumbaikars who, despite all odds, thrive in this crowded and chaotic city. “Some creatures, like the gorgonian sea fan corals, which you expect to only see in crystal clear pristine waters, are found here along the shores. Every time the tide recedes, it’s a new world that you are looking at. It’s as dynamic as the ebb and flow of the tides,” she adds. A sea fan coral at Breach Candy; sponges, zoanthids, hydroids and algae at the Marine Drive shore; colourful nudibranch sea slugs Shaunak Modi, director of Coastal Conservation Foundation, a nonprofit organisation that evolved from MLOM in 2019 to extend the model beyond citizen science and take it to other parts of India, says: “Though I grew up close to Juhu Beach, the narrative was always about the pollution, dirt and garbage, and I never expected to find any life on these shores. On one of my shore walks, I saw a cratena sea slug, an alien-looking creature that wowed me and cemented my place in MOLM. I was amazed at how much biodiversity existed on these shores.” The diverse marine life exists despite the constant onslaught of development in the city. “We clearly should not build over the intertidal zone, but over 200 to 300 years this has been happening in Mumbai, with the shores getting landfilled for development,” says Jamalabad. The controversial Coastal Road project, which will run alongside the Arabian sea for 18 miles (29.2km), threatens corals and olive ridley sea turtles among other creatures, say campaigners. “There was a lot of noise about the corals and some of it was translocated, but what about the other creatures and their habitats that would be affected by this development?” says Modi. “The people who come on our walks are an extremely diverse bunch – from graphic designers to doctors and architects. All want to get to know their city better,” says Mehta. “Hopefully, this will translate into an increasing awareness and desire to protect the precious shores so that future generations can enjoy them.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,"‘Every time the tide recedes, it’s a new world’: Mumbai’s marine life revealed",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/14/mumbai-marine-india-life-revealed-aoe
2/14/2022,"For two straight days, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has fronted reporters to fend off questions after being drawn in to a slow-burning public service integrity saga. The complex story involves the removal and alleged wiping of an Integrity Commission employee’s laptop, amid questions over how to ensure the independence of the body charged with regulating lobbying in Queensland.  The situation, which is largely separate from recent issues with the state’s Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC), has blossomed into what the state opposition and some media outlets are calling an “integrity crisis”. And now Palaszczuk is in their sights. Last month the state’s integrity commissioner, Dr Nikola Stepanov, announced her resignation amid complaints about interference in her office by the Queensland Public Service Commission (PSC). The integrity commissioner is an independent statutory office, whose responsibility is to advise MPs and public servants on ethics matters, and to regulate lobbying activities. The PSC – which is a central government agency assisting departments with managing their workforce – controls the integrity commissioner’s budget and staff. Stepanov raised concerns last year about interference in her office by the PSC, and complained thatthe PSC had gradually stripped her of resources and key staff. The Courier-Mail reported that in late 2020 Stepanov also raised concerns about the way an employee in her office had handled confidential documents. She requested a forensic examination of the employee’s laptop. In March 2021, the PSC removed and allegedly wiped the contents of a laptop. The CCC is currently investigating a complaint related to the deletion of files from the laptop. The Australian has claimed in a report that while Stepanov was unable to comment on what material was on the laptop “given the contents were subsequently deleted without my knowledge or consent”, the laptop contained documents relating to former Labor lord mayor of Brisbane, Jim Soorley and that, at the time, Stepanov was delving into a complaint that he had been involved in unlawful lobbying. Guardian Australia has been unable to independently verify those claims and understands that Soorley denies the allegations. In April last year, Stepanov met with the former Department of Premier and Cabinet director-general Dave Stewart to raise concerns about interference by the PSC and the seizure of the laptop. Stewart agreed to commission an investigation. On Sunday it was revealed that about two weeks after this meeting, Palaszczuk referred historic complaints about Stepanov’s own conduct to a parliamentary committee that has oversight of her office. Those complaints were initially made in January 2019 and previously dismissed by the CCC. No, though the timing of the referral has certainly amped up the “integrity crisis” rhetoric that has dominated political debate in Queensland in recent weeks. “Stepanov Affair explodes at the top of Queensland corridors of power,” read the front page of the Sunday Mail this week. Stepanov told the Australian the timing of the referral was “of great interest to me, particularly in light of the fact I had raised formal concerns about conduct I was suspicious of through to the Public Service Commission in late 2020”. “I was dissatisfied with how those concerns were handled by the PSC and I escalated the matter to the Department of Premier and Cabinet.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It is unclear who brought the matter to Palaszczuk. She says she sought the advice of the solicitor general and was legally required to refer the matter to the committee, regardless of the seriousness. “I can’t discuss who made the complaint,” Palaszczuk said on Monday. “I pride myself in acting in accordance with the law and discharging my legal obligations according to that. “I have absolutely discharged my obligation that I was required to do.” Palaszczuk told reporters on Sunday she “never, never, never” wanted Stepanov to resign. The CCC investigation into the alleged deletion of documents from the laptop is ongoing, and for the moment, that process provides some cover to calls for a more broad-ranging inquiry. Guardian Australia understands the fundamental issue raised by Stepanov is not that she believed direct political interference had occurred, but that interference in her office was part of a broader culture of opposing activities that might undermine public confidence in agencies or reflect poorly on governments. Key questions remain about the PSC’s effective defunding and alleged interference in the integrity commissioner’s office, which is supposed to be independent.",News/Australia news,What’s driving reports of an ‘integrity crisis’ in Queensland?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/14/whats-driving-reports-of-an-integrity-crisis-in-queensland
2/14/2022,"Garth: “You ever get the feeling that Benjamin is not one of us?” Wayne: “Good call. It’s as if Benjamin wants us to be liked by everyone. I mean, Led Zeppelin didn’t write tunes that everyone liked. They left that to the Bee Gees.”  Thirty years later, that exchange in Wayne’s World seems both righteous and quaint, a cultural relic from a time when battle lines were drawn more sharply between independents and mainstream “sellouts”. After all, young adults of today have more consequential things to worry about than whether their favorite indie band signed to a major label. But as Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey), the hosts of a freewheeling cable access hit in suburban Illinois, fret about Benjamin (Rob Lowe), the corporate slickster imposing changes on the show, the point still stands. Not all art needs to have universal appeal. Nor does stupid nonsense. How the premise of Wayne’s World might land with different people of different generations and backgrounds is a fascinating litmus test, but a large part of the film’s enduring appeal is its 1992-ness. All movies are destined to become period pieces no matter when they’re set, of course, and there’s no doubt director Penelope Spheeris, the brilliant creator of the Decline of Western Civilization documentary trilogy, had a better sense than anyone about what independence stood for at the time. Yet Wayne’s World is a wondrous repository of pop arcana, with carbon-dated references to the babes of the day (Heather Locklear, Claudia Schiffer), Robert Patrick in Terminator 2, and commercials for Grey Poupon, Nuprin, Chia Pets and “The Clapper”. The extreme self-awareness owes something to the roots of the film itself, which began as a wildly popular recurring segment on Saturday Night Live, a mainstream institution if there ever was one. Wayne’s World frequently reminds the audience that it knows about the inherent hypocrisy of celebrating integrity and outsidership through a Paramount Pictures adaptation of an SNL skit. In the middle of Wayne and Garth’s tussles with Benjamin over the creative direction of the show, there’s a whole sequence where Wayne looks into the camera and says: “Contract or no, I will not bow to any sponsor” while smiling over Pizza Hut and Doritos. They will have their cake and eat it, too. And they will tell you about it with cake in their mouths. Still, selling out isn’t a binary proposition, but a matter of degrees. And Wayne’s World, both the movie and the show-within-the-movie, has a canny sense of what’s essential to its point of view. When Wayne first breaks the fourth wall and confides to the camera – a device the film uses to varied and hilarious effect – he confesses to still living with his parents and shares his “extensive collection of name tags and haircuts”. Wayne and Garth are thrilled to take real money for hosting the show out of a suburban basement and desperate enough not to bother sweating the details of the contract. They unwittingly sell their souls for two $5,000 checks and an oversized rum cocktail. Benjamin isn’t one of them. Lowe plays him as a corporate alien worthy of The Man Who Fell to Earth, the type of guy who would turn up at a football game wearing an NFL hat. He needs his latest girlfriend to explain the appeal of the show, just as he needs his advertising partner (Brian Doyle Murray), the owner of arcade chain, to explain the appeal of video games to him. (“Gelatinous cube eats village. I think it’s terrific.”) Benjamin thinks in demographics and dollar signs, glomming on to whatever hip widget keeps him in his Chicago high-rise apartment, a “fully functional babe lair”, as Garth puts it. And even then, he needs to consult multiple books on how to pick up chicks. For SNL fans who already knew Wayne’s World as a skit exactly as silly and low-rent as the show Benjamin acquires, the plot confronts the question that hovered over the film: can this work at longer than five minutes? The answer would be an emphatic no every other time producer Lorne Michaels would try it: Coneheads, Stuart Saves His Family, A Night at the Roxbury, Superstar, The Ladies Man. But Spheeris and the screenwriters, Myers and Bonnie and Terry Turner, not only excel at supplying enough quality gags to fill 90 minutes, but sketch out Wayne’s actual world with more care and detail than expected. Their Aurora may be a suburban dead end, but it has character. The famed Bohemian Rhapsody singalong in Garth’s AMC Pacer represents everything the film does well: the camaraderie between friends, a genuine love of music and popular culture, and an eye for the redeeming quirks of suburbia, even though the Illinois landmarks were piped in via second unit. In order to sell out, you have to have something of value, and Spheeris finds it in the chemistry between Wayne, Garth, and their long-haired buddies in the crew, and how the show speaks to other humble bros who dream of partying with Alice Cooper, but are stuck ranking supermodels on the “stroke-ability scale”. Wayne’s World is about the fantasy coming to life, including Wayne winning romantic interest from a singer (Tia Carrere) several galaxies out of his league. It’s also aware that such fantasies only happen in the movies, no more plausible than a “Scooby-Doo ending”. Though Wayne’s World unloads an exhausting battery of catchphrases (“Schwing!” “… NOT!,” “Party on!” “That’s what she said”), most of it is still hilarious, particularly anything to do with Garth, who Carvey plays as a burnout and tech savant who thrives on the margins. Garth cannot function without Wayne – when he tries to do the show solo, he shrinks from the camera like the victim in a slasher movie – but Carvey uses his sidekick status to drift off into an unpredictable stream of consciousness. (“Did you ever find Bugs Bunny attractive when he put on a dress and played a girl bunny?”) Selling out does nothing for an authentic weirdo guy like Garth. No matter what happens, he’ll always be in a forest with Heather Locklear.",Arts/Film,Wayne’s World at 30: the rare Saturday Night Live movie that could,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/14/waynes-world-snl-mike-myers-dana-carvey
2/14/2022,"Alexis Danielsen sat down and rolled up her sleeve. When the shot went into her arm, one thought flooded her mind: “Finally!” It was May 2021, and she was receiving her first Covid shot – in fact, her first immunization of any kind. She was 39.  Danielsen grew up in an anti-vaccine household, views she held well into adulthood. When her son was born, she declined all vaccines for him. Then she hit a personal crisis, and started rethinking all of her beliefs – including on vaccinations. It was like pulling on a thread and watching an entire sweater unravel, she said. “The Covid vaccine was the only logical choice after really re-evaluating what I believe in, what I actually believe is true,” Danielsen said. Danielsen partly credits her about-face to Lydia Greene and Heather Simpson, the Canada-based founders of Back to the Vax, a support group for people like themselves: one-time vaccine skeptics who’d had a change of heart. “I want to be able to help stop people from going down that road, having been down it myself,” said Greene, now a nursing student. They say their goal is to help families find evidence-based answers to their questions. Vaccine hesitancy was a growing problem even before the pandemic, particularly among parents. Now, nearly one-third of American parents are opposed to vaccinating their children against Covid-19. Although parents still have a lot of questions about vaccines, advocates say that answering them can help. Online support and in-person community groups can help address longstanding hesitations, some of which arise from poor experiences in the medical system. For example, parents tell Greene they are still waiting for more information to come out on the Covid vaccines before deciding whether to vaccinate their children. “What’s missing is that, in the US right now, millions of children in that age group have been vaccinated and are followed closely with V-Safe and other databases to show the safety of the vaccine,” Greene said. Parents also believe that Covid is mild in children and poses a low risk to them. But kids can suffer from long-term effects – and continued transmission also affects their emotional wellbeing. In the US, more than 167,000 children have lost a caregiver to the virus, Greene said. “We’re seeing this massive epidemic of not just Covid but kids becoming orphans before their time.” Her two older children are vaccinated, but her three-year-old isn’t eligible yet, and when Covid struck their household the older children developed mild cases, but the younger boy needed to be taken to the hospital. “It affected everything,” Greene said: his lungs, his eyes, his ears. The decision isn’t between getting vaccinated and doing nothing, she said. It’s between getting vaccinated and getting Covid. “The question is, do you want to be vaccinated before you go through it?” Still, she understands exactly how vaccine hesitancy can be driven by the healthcare system. Back when she was anti-vaccine, Greene said she remembers doctors reacting with vitriol when they found out. “It just made me close myself off further – I felt really judged and upset and hurt and embarrassed.” Many people feel that way about the healthcare system, particularly those who haven’t ben well-served by it in the past, said Jason Autar, chief operating officer of Oyate, a non-profit that has vaccinated 30,000 people in underserved communities in New York City. If you don’t have a regular physician or pediatrician, it’s difficult to find good answers to your questions, he pointed out – which is often the case due to “decades of negligence within our communities”, especially among communities of color, where Covid vaccine hesitancy is built upon years of inadequate healthcare and other systemic issues. “That’s what’s leaving us behind, and that’s what’s causing that hesitancy.” Being consistent and visible within the community is important, Autar said. “It can’t be just a moment here and now type of thing – ‘When we have a surge, we’re going to come back out and galvanize all those resources.’ No, we still are in a pandemic. And we need to still remain visible within hesitant communities. And that’s hard work.” He added: “Our approach has always been ‘we’re here to educate you about the vaccine, your options, your choices’, rather than take the approach of ‘you need to get this vaccine’.” Greene echoes that. Reaching hesitant families means withholding the kind of judgment that kept her ashamed, and understanding that people have legitimate concerns that need to be addressed. “It’s almost a knee-jerk reaction to just stop them in their tracks and correct them, but that’s only going to further alienate them. You have to listen to them with an open mind,” Greene said. And then health workers can start responding to those specific concerns and opening the lines of further communication. “Hear them out fully and say, ‘Oh, let me look into that for you.’ “They may not change their mind overnight, but by taking your time, you’re ensuring that they could change their minds,” Greene said. “But if it becomes this conflict and it’s a negative experience, you’re basically closing that door off completely.” Women make about 80% of health care decisions for families, on average, and vaccination decisions frequently fall to mothers. “There’s so much pressure for moms to do everything perfectly,” Greene said. Among middle-class mothers, for instance, there’s a message that “you can afford all these products to do better, and so you don’t need vaccines – vaccines are for poor people. “There’s so much influence on social media, on how to parent. Everyone wants to do their best. And it’s easy to kind of hack that desire to profit.” While social media has played an outsized role in driving this misinformation, it can also be used to provide accurate information, Greene said. “You can text a pediatrician or tweet at an infectious disease pediatrician who actually knows about kids and infectious disease, and they will answer your questions. It’s amazing.” When Danielsen told the public health nurse giving her the Covid shot that it was her first ever vaccination, the nurse was thrilled. “She was super excited for me,” Danielsen said. They kept in touch, and the nurse gave Danielsen and her son all of their vaccines over the next few months. For people who have skipped vaccinations in the past, building relationships like these can be incredibly helpful, Greene said. That way, “you’re not having to re-explain why you’re catching up on all these vaccines – because even just explaining yourself can bring a lot of anxiety”. Danielsen agrees about the importance of medical professionals creating a bond with patients. “Doctors and nurses need to know that there’s a lot of people who are really scared of them,” she said. “So many people have bad experiences in the medical system … [which] makes it really hard to trust them.” As for her own decision to finally get vaccinated, she was embarrassed to have waited so long, and worried she might face mockery, or contempt for putting her son at risk. Instead, she’s been surprised to be welcomed into the scientific community. “Everyone is like, ‘Yeah, you changed your mind. That’s fucking awesome.’”",News/US news, ‘The only logical choice’: anti-vaxxers who changed their minds on Covid vaccines,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/14/covid-anti-vaxxers-changed-minds
2/14/2022,"Families bereaved by Covid want Boris Johnson to relinquish control over which issues will be investigated in the pandemic public inquiry, alleging he is compromised by allegations of lockdown-breaking at Downing Street. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group fears the current arrangement, where Johnson has a final say over inquiry topics, could allow him to water down examination of how his own conduct and that of senior officials may have undermined public trust in infection control measures that the bereaved say cost lives.  The group, which represents more than 6,000 families, is calling on the prime minister to commit to accepting terms of reference presented by the chair to the inquiry, Lady Hallett, after a public consultation. Under the Inquiries Act it is for the minister in formal charge to set the terms of reference, in this case the prime minister. “It’s becoming increasingly clear that it’s not good enough for him to just take the chair’s recommendations for the terms of reference as advice and he needs to commit to implementing them in full,” said Hannah Brady, a member of the bereaved group. “The fact his office is under police investigation for breaching the rules shows he is compromised and cannot be allowed to have a final say on what the inquiry looks into.” More than 159,000 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test and more than 180,000 had Covid on their death certificates. The call for control over the inquiry’s terms of reference to be handed to Hallett was backed by the Labour party. “This inquiry is one of the most important in living history yet it is being supervised by a government paralysed by total chaos,” said Fleur Anderson, the shadow paymaster general. “If the prime minister had any respect for the bereaved families he would accept and implement the chair’s recommendations in full, not half-heartedly or under advisement. We cannot allow an administration currently under police investigation to mark its own homework on how it handled the pandemic.” A government spokesperson said: “As the prime minister has previously stated, the Covid inquiry is set to begin its work in spring 2022. Bereaved families and the wider public will be consulted on the inquiry’s terms of reference before they are finalised.” Johnson wrote to Brady on Thursday reiterating his apology over the Downing Street gatherings. The death certificate of Brady’s father, Shaun, was signed on 20 May 2020, the same day a “bring your own booze” party was held in the Downing Street garden. Downing Street officials and Johnson have received questionnaires from the Met police as part of “Operation Hillman”, an investigation into events on eight dates between May 2020 to April 2021. Brady wrote to Johnson on 11 January after he claimed he did not know if he had attended the garden party. He later admitted he had. Brady accused him of treating it as “one big joke”. His reply, a month later, said: “Following the publication of Sue Gray’s report on 31 January, I apologised personally for the things that we simply did not get right and how this matter has been handled. I want to reiterate that apology to you.” But he said it would be “inappropriate for me to comment on particular dates while the Metropolitan police is currently carrying out its investigation”. The call for Johnson to step aside from setting the public inquiry terms of reference comes amid signs of slow progress in setting up one of the most wide-ranging and politically challenging public fact-finding processes in British legal history. In May 2021 Johnson announced that a statutory public inquiry would begin in spring this year and on 15 December he named Hallett chair, but it is looking increasingly unlikely that proceedings will start anytime soon, with some observers believing it may not begin until late summer. In December Johnson told parliament that after consulting the devolved administrations on the terms of reference for the inquiry – with Scotland having already announced its own inquiry – he would publish these in draft “in the new year”. Two months later they remain under wraps.",News/UK news,Bereaved families call for PM to lose say over UK Covid inquiry topics,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/bereaved-families-call-for-pm-to-lose-say-over-uk-covid-inquiry-topics
2/14/2022,"When Sandya Narayanswami was invited to a dinner by a friend who worked at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, she was excited. Many of the guests flew planes. “I must have expressed some yearning,” she says, because someone told her: “You should join the flying club!” The next day Narayanswami, who was 57 at the time, arranged to meet an instructor. “I said: ‘Aren’t I too old?’ He said: ‘We’ve got students in their 80s.’” On her trial flight, her instructor took her over Pasadena. “You are very close to the air, because the plane is really small and the windows are big. I felt the air, I felt the motion. I felt as a bird might feel,” she says.  Narayanswami first flew when she was eight. Her mother worked for British Overseas Airways Corporation at Heathrow, her father for Global Air Freight. Every summer they visited family in India. “Flying in the 60s was like private flying,” she says. Her mother made her a “beautiful fitted dress of white lace”. At fuel stops in Zurich, Tel Aviv or Frankfurt, Narayanswami got “a feel for what it was like to be in a different country”. Back then, “children were invited into the flight deck to meet the pilots”. Narayanswami remembers looking out at “vast clouds”; the plane appeared not to be moving. “The captain explained that the clouds were so vast, it took a long time to fly past them.” Narayanswami’s own logbook notes that she needed 423 flight hours to earn her pilot’s licence. She was 64. “It took a long time because I had a lot of confidence issues,” she says. At the time, she worked as a fundraising director at California Institute of Technology (which runs the flight club), and now consults for other institutions. But she grew up in Southall, west London, and at grammar school suffered horrific racist bullying. The library provided sanctuary. But, as she reached her late teens, she felt family pressure for an arranged marriage to a south Indian; her parents were from Kerala. Southall was mostly Punjabi. “I really protested,” she says. “‘But I want to be an astronaut! I don’t want to marry a boy from the village.’ “My mother made a promise. ‘As long as you are getting an education, we will not look for a husband for you.’” Narayanswami studied biological studies at Leicester University, then did a PhD at St Andrews, followed by postdoctoral research at the University of Strasbourg and the University of California. “Every time you move you get further away,” her dad remarked on the phone. “I didn’t feel I would be able to escape unless I did that,” she says. “I felt I was a pioneer … When I was young I wanted to be able to look back on my life and realise I had seen the world. It has been that way. But it has been quite hard because I am Indian and I’m a woman, and I never got married and I had no children.” These days, she says, she does “sort of hanker” for marriage. As for the astronaut career, in 2020, aged 64, she finally applied to Nasa’s astronaut corps, and received a very appreciative rejection. Even now, at 66, she says: “I haven’t been able to figure out how to deal with [rejection]. It doesn’t go away.” The racist bullying she received as a child has cast a very long shadow. Flying has helped. It is a workout: she has to tow the plane out to the taxiway. And being airborne offers a different perspective. “You can see eagles, bears, coyotes, mountain lions, birds of prey. “I love the beauty of the clouds. They are like hills. Vaster than our hills,” she says, recalling the pilot’s words on those childhood flights. “It gives me a sense of freedom.” New possibilities have arisen – Narayanswami chairs the board of the General Aviation Awards in the US – but she finds relaxing difficult. “I can’t switch off. I’m always churning something, something. But when I’m in the plane I focus totally on flying.” In flight, she is “part of a huge network of people who are communicating by radio frequency. There is no sense of skin colour. We are all tied together by our voices.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?

2/14/2022,"Q I am nearing the end of the fixed-rate deal for the mortgage on my flat. My partner and I are planning on moving in together sometime in the next 12 months. My flat doesn’t suit both of our needs, so we would probably need to rent a new property together. Am I better off selling my flat and having the equity (and existing cash savings) ready to put down as a deposit on a new home, either jointly or independently, in a year or two; or should I seek to rent out my flat? I don’t have much knowledge of agents’ fees, and other costs and taxes associated with renting it out; what can I expect? Based on my initial workings, I suspect I would be hoping to at best break even rather than to make a profit from renting it out.  If I decided to (and was able to) rent it out, I would want to be a good landlord, including by offering the option of longer-term tenancies. Regardless of any changes to my relationship status, I do not want to remain living in my flat for the long term. Selling the flat seems like the simplest option, and would give me a bigger deposit for my next home, but what are the risks in doing so? Would keeping my flat serve me better as a long-term investment?SH A Given that you don’t want to stay in your flat long term and are going to sell it at some point, I wondered why you don’t just sell it now and buy another property that does suit both of your needs. But maybe your partner doesn’t want to live in a property that is owned by you (not that I can think why that would be a problem). If that is the case, then your choice, as you have laid out, is between selling your flat and renting it out. Selling is, as you say, the simplest option but if you are not planning to buy somewhere else straight away, you’ll miss out on any growth in the flat’s value in the next year or two. Any interest you earn on the cash made by selling is unlikely to match property price growth. This would not be the case if you chose to rent the property out. Taking that option would also mean that you had somewhere to move back to if living together doesn’t work out. But that assumes you can let your flat. It could well be that your lease says that you’re not allowed to. Even if you can, you will need to establish that you are able either to convert your mortgage to a buy to let or get permission from your current lender to let the flat. Converting to a buy-to-let mortgage is only an option if the mortgage would represent 75% or less of the value of the flat. If your current mortgage is more than 75% of the flat’s value you’ll have to hope that your current lender will give you permission to let the property. There is another potential barrier to getting a buy-to-let mortgage: the rent you get from the flat must cover the mortgage payments by 125%. The other factors to take into account are agents’ fees – which can be as much as 20% (including VAT) of rent paid if you choose a full management service, the cost of safety checks and income tax on the rent less expenses.

2/14/2022,"Sometime in January someone started falsely using my car’s number plate. The first I knew about it was a parking charge at Stansted airport, which was quickly sorted out when I explained it wasn’t me or my car. However, shortly afterwards I received two charges from Transport for London for supposedly driving in the ultra low emission zone. At the time of the violations, I was alone in my flat in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, and my car was in a nearby car park. Due to my schizoaffective disorder, I spend a lot of time alone in my flat. As a consequence, there are no witnesses who can vouch for me and no evidence I can provide to prove my whereabouts.  This is fairly normal for my type of disability and doesn’t usually cause any problems. I explained all this to TfL via an online form but it is demanding more evidence, including photographs of my car. I tried to upload the photos but can’t find the online button to do so. TfL is now demanding I post them but I don’t own a printer and my agoraphobia and paranoia are such that I can’t access anywhere to print them. It seems someone else with the same Peugeot car as me is driving around with cloned number plates. Can you help? RM, St Ives For most of us, having a car number plate cloned would be hard enough but it has been particularly challenging for someone in your position. Car cloning seems to be a growing problem in this country. Fraudsters and criminals spot a car of the same, make, model and colour, and get a fake set of number plates made up. It saves them having to buy insurance or tax and to pay parking fines and other charges, as the bill is sent to the real owner, who then faces a battle to show it wasn’t them. I took up your complaint and was able to email the photos of your car which has slightly different wheels to the one caught driving in London. TfL now accepts it wasn’t your car. It has dropped the two £80 demands, and has noted the cloning on its database. The DVLA advises those in your shoes to contact the police. You should also write to the DVLA with the crime reference number, allowing it to “keep a record of the matter for future reference”. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

2/14/2022,"Michael Tonkovich spent the week after Thanksgiving at deer processors around Ohio, swabbing the carcasses to test for Sars-CoV-2, the virus that can cause Covid-19. When he explained his goal to hunters, a common reaction was: help yourself. And perhaps you can butcher it too, they joked.  Whether or not the hunters saw the utility of a study testing deer for the Covid-causing virus, Tonkovich, deer program administrator for the Ohio department of natural resources division of wildlife, certainly did. White-tailed deer infected with the virus have been found in 15 states, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Scientists working in Staten Island, New York, also recently discovered the highly contagious Omicron variant circulating among the species for the first time. Although Covid-19 itself has not been found in deer, how serious the presence of the virus in deer could be for humans remains unclear. Whether anything could even be done to limit its spread is equally uncertain. “If they are getting it through sewage or garbage or runoff … there is likely nothing we can do about that,” said Tonkovich. Scientists nevertheless think the surveillance is urgent. Deer could act as large reservoirs for the virus, and serve as a source for new variants that could then spill over into humans. If you don’t know where the virus is, they reason, the already difficult task of managing it becomes impossible. “When you have a population as large and as close as it is to humans” as white-tailed deer that serves as a reservoir for the virus, “it just makes sense to keep an eye on it”, said Tonkovich. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, illustrates the need for “more targeted surveillance to better understand the circulation of Sars-CoV-2 in wild animals,” said Suresh Kuchipudi, a veterinary microbiologist at Penn State University who led the Staten Island research team. “Before we can conclude whether or not something can be done, we need to define the problem first.” Researchers also recently found that pet hamsters and mink were capable of catching the virus from humans – and spreading it to them. While there is no evidence that deer are capable of infecting humans with the virus, they could infect other animals – and because they are in the wild, rather than in captivity like hamsters and mink, that risk “is much more significant”, said Kuchipudi. But controlling the spread of a virus among animals is often difficult or impossible, said Sarah Olson, an epidemiologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society. She points to how Covid-19 has been able to spread among humans despite visits to health providers and tools such as vaccines. She also cited the devastating impact of diseases such as white-nose syndrome, which, despite scientists’ protection efforts, has killed more than 90% of three North America bat species, according to a study in the journal Conservation Biology. As for addressing the spread of the virus among deer, Olson does not think that applying our standard responses to Covid in people – such as trying to vaccinate them – is realistic. Instead, the research is “a call to redouble our efforts, to pay attention to wildlife health, to understand what is going on in these spaces that are currently kind of black boxes”, Olson said. One goal for scientists is to learn whether the virus spread from human to deer via wastewater, which would then allow public health officials to consider: “How are we protecting waste sites to prevent spread of diseases from people to wildlife?” Olson said. Prevention efforts could get a boost after the House on 4 February passed the America Competes Act, which calls for the US government to work with other countries and NGOs to close commercial wildlife markets – where some scientists think the pandemic originated – and to end the trade of terrestrial wildlife for human consumption, aiming instead to reduce the demand for wildlife as food. But only one Republican voted in favor of the bill, and it is unclear if it will die in the Senate. In the meantime, Kuchipudi said uncertainty about the spread of the virus among deer and other animals means that talk of the end of the pandemic is premature. “The Omicron variant could continue to spill over into animals and evolve, and therefore we can’t let our guard down and must continue to follow the precautions,” such as masking and social distancing, he said. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to emphasize that the risk of catching Covid from animals is very low. Jennifer Ramsey, wildlife veterinarian with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, fields calls from hunters about it, whom she urges to wear gloves and use good hygiene when handling carcasses. Indeed, for many hunters, talk of a potential virus in deer is nothing new. The CDC has long urged people hunting in areas with chronic wasting disease (CWD) to test the deer or elk before eating the meat, but there is no evidence of infection in people. The same appears clear with Covid, at least for now. “It doesn’t seem like it’s anything to panic about – but just something to be aware of,” said Ramsey.",News/World news,How serious is the presence of the Covid virus in deer for humans? ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/covid-virus-in-deer
2/14/2022,"The prosecution of a New York husband and wife arrested last week on suspicion of stealing $3.6bn in bitcoin in what has been described as “the heist of the century” may test US authorities’ ability to crack down on cybercrime. It may also test the bounds of believability as more and more colorful – and downright bizarre – details emerge of the couple at the heart of the saga which seems to lie at an unlikely nexus between the cryptocurrency, rap, self-help advice and New York eccentricity.  The couple targeted in the sting, Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, a self-described “badass money maker”, were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the United States. They are currently on $5m and $3m bail, respectively, but held in custody after a judge in Washington granted an emergency request by the government to keep them detained. But prosecutors are not trying to tie them to the actual theft from a Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange in 2016. Instead, the case unveiled by the Department of Justice on Tuesday alleges that the couple used a complicated web of transactions to transfer about 25,000 of the 119,754 bitcoin stolen by hackers. The couple’s lawyer, Samson Enzer, argued in a court filing on Wednesday there are “significant holes in the government’s case against them”. But according to Money Laundering News, the case may be the first time the government has brought a case not on the basis of an alleged theft, but on the couple’s alleged efforts to conceal their identity from virtual currency financial institutions with obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) to report transactions to regulators. At the time of the heist, the coins were valued at $71m but are now worth about about $4.5bn – to various virtual currency exchangers. According to the government’s Statement of Facts, the stolen bitcoin was “layered” and “chain-hopped” through a series of virtual wallets to the “darknet market AlphaBay” and then back, and finally on to accounts where it was converted into fiat currency, gift cards and precious metals and withdrawn as cash from bitcoin ATMs. What may be more fascinating is that the couple at the center of what US prosecutors have described as the largest financial seizure in the history of the Department of Justice were able to utilize so little of the stolen cryptocurrency. Authorities said more than 80% of the stolen currency remained untouched in accounts associated with the couple and money laundering allegations against them identify only small sums, including the purchase of a $500 Walmart gift card and gift cards for Uber, Hotels.com and PlayStation. Indeed the entire lifestyle of the pair hardly matches what one might imagine criminals whose alleged theft has such an astonishingly high value. Their Manhattan apartment was rented and cluttered with cat toys and exercise equipment. They walked their Bengal cat named Clarissa on a leash. The pair had a huge social media and internet presence with many hours of video and other postings. In one, unearthed by Vice, Lichtenstein apparently was filmed eating cat food. Morgan presented herself variously as “the Crocodile of Wall Street”, “Razzlekhan”, a surrealist artist and rapper with “more pizzazz than Genghis Khan”, as well as the “Turkish Martha Stewart” and the “Waffle Queen of Korea”. She wrote on her website that she was always pushing the limits. “Whether that leads to something wonderful or terrible is unclear; the only thing that’s certain is it won’t be boring or mediocre,” she said. In that respect she was not wrong. In a column for Forbes magazine that reeks with cheeky hindsight she wrote about “Experts Share Tips To Protect Your Business From Cybercriminals” accompanied by an author biography that puffed “when she’s not reverse-engineering black markets to think of better ways to combat fraud and cyber crime, she enjoys rapping and designing streetwear fashion”. She posted singles and videos on YouTube, including a 2019 song, Versace Bedouin – described as an “anthem for misfits and weirdos” – while dressed in a gold lamé jacket in front of a statue of George Washington in New York’s financial district. She gave a talk at the Williamsburg hotel in Brooklyn titled “How to Social Engineer Your Way Into Anything”. Her husband disclosed in a Facebook post that he’s planned his marriage proposal around “a weird, creative multi-channel marketing campaign” that featured posters and digital ads that “captured the essence of Razzlekhan: surreal, mysterious, creepy and sexy”. But their downfall may have come because bitcoin is more easily traced on blockchain – a financial ledger – than other cryptocurrencies and because they simply had too much of it. “It [would be] mindbogglingly stupid to steal this much bitcoin,” Frank Weert, the co-founder of Whale Alert, a blockchain tracking and analytics company, told the Financial Times. “If they had stolen 500 bitcoin, no one would have bothered trying to find them, but this was the heist of the century.”",News/Law,‘Heist of the century’: US bitcoin case tests ability to crack down on cybercrime,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/14/us-bitcoin-case-cybercrime
2/14/2022,"The reputation of the Canadian writer Sheila Heti, who came to prominence amid the reality-hungry vogue of the last decade, rests largely on a pair of candid comic novels mingling philosophy, performance art and self-help. In 2013’s How Should a Person Be?, a divorced playwright, Sheila, is kept from her work by an alarmingly submissive sexual liaison; in Motherhood, from 2018, the Heti-adjacent narrator, nearing 40 in a long-term relationship, doesn’t want kids (“I don’t care about passing on my genes! Can’t one pass on one’s genes through art?”). In both books, an ambling narrative drew a measure of urgency from a dilemma that turns on stubbornly cleft logic: to be a writer, or a lover? Make art, or a baby? More either/ors drive Heti’s brazenly strange new novel, less openly autobiographical than her past work. It follows Mira, a young female student infatuated with a standoffish peer, Annie, whose eye Mira is busily out to catch when her father dies, unleashing a psychodrama of regret that she didn’t spend more time with him. The stuff of a normal, if momentous, rite-of-passage tale, you might think, except that these events unspool retrospectively from the vantage point of an imminent apocalypse as God contemplates a “second draft” of creation, and that’s just for starters. Mira’s cohort, living in a kind of bizarro version of Toronto, are all in training to become art critics, a uniquely sought-after occupation (one of the novel’s many hard-to-parse jokes), and everyone in the book is said to resemble a bird, fish, or bear, a strict taxonomy conferring pivotal personality traits. And halfway through the novel, Mira finds herself trapped inside a leaf, talking to her father, thanks to the transmigration of souls…  Getting the measure of all this is like trying to weigh a gas. Initially the narration seems whimsical and fey, caught between cosmic musing in a lofty first-person plural and the fable-like timbre of Mira’s story, although Heti’s metaphorical range keeps you on your toes, to say the least: when Mira first meets Annie, we’re told their horizons widen “like a vagina… stretching for a very large cock”, and when her father dies, she feels “his spirit ejaculate into her, like it was the entire universe coming into her body, then spreading all the way through her, the way cum feels spreading inside, that warm and tangy feeling”. Still, I was losing faith that Heti had any kind of purpose in sight by the time the leaf business came along to put a welcome rocket up all the meandering drollery, allowing the novel to work an impressive spectrum of meaning and feeling, both abstract and tangible, solemn as well as silly, hitting notes that recall Ovid, Kafka and, oddly, the climax of Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar. The wacky metaphysics generate a what-if? comedy that gains voltage from Heti’s refusal to milk it for allegory, as grieving Mira, shut off from humanity, tries to signal to Annie as she passes her tree in the company of another woman. You might see Pure Colour as the last in a tragicomic trilogy of fretful overthinking: after sex and potential procreation, now comes mortality and the fate of childhood. Puberty, here, is provocatively figured as betrayal (“the body becomes a grown-up and it cannot turn back”), an opening salvo in a ceaseless push-pull of filial obligation and independence. Freedom, previously a Heti watchword, in this book tastes of guilt, not least when Mira wonders why it was only when her father lay dying that she felt free to embrace him. Heti’s questing idiosyncrasy means there’s little time for any of this to get treacly. “In the next draft of existence, everyone will love everyone, and they will consider our lives and think with a shudder, Until they pushed a person out of their dirtiest parts, they had no one they could truly love, and no one who could truly love them – except for their own parents, who also pushed them out of their dirtiest parts.” How about that for another crack at outlining the ambivalence behind Motherhood? And amid the weirdness, it’s also very funny: we’re told that the reason we lose touch with what’s cool, the older we get, is that God “doesn’t want the criticism of the most dynamic parts of culture coming from someone in the middle of life… God doesn’t care what you think about a band.” At one point, we’re told that Mira doesn’t know “why she spent so much of her life… looking at websites, when just outside the window there was a sky”. The ensuing riff earns a bittersweet laugh, but the thought nags: why not both? Online and outside, sex and writing, art and a baby? Yet while Heti’s binary-mania isn’t always persuasive, this one-of-a-kind novel, curious in two senses, still feels nothing less than vital, even if only because, in tackling the bond between the living and the dead, she now has the mother of all either/ors on her hands.

2/14/2022,"Warren Entsch has come under fire for abandoning an offer to help first-term Liberal MPs vote up religious discrimination bill amendments to protect LGBTQ+ students. A Liberal MP told Guardian Australia that Entsch had “promised the ‘youngsters’ in the party that he would provide them cover” to stand up to the Morrison government before refusing to join five colleagues who crossed the floor.  The comments are the latest salvo in a battle over the government’s decision to ditch the bill due to amendments preventing religious schools discriminating on gender and sexuality. On Friday, Entsch and the defence minister, Peter Dutton, accused unnamed Liberal MPs of breaching commitments to the government. As Guardian Australia revealed, while Bridget Archer and Trent Zimmerman were the first two to cross, Fiona Martin provided the crucial third vote. They were then joined by Dave Sharma and Katie Allen who had said they would cross if the government were already set to lose the vote. Entsch expressed concerns about the religious discrimination bill, but told the House of Representatives on Wednesday he had chosen to “bank the successes” of improvements removing the Folau and conscientious objection clauses. Entsch also secured a shorter six-month timeframe and broader terms of reference for a review into gender and sexuality discrimination in schools. But a Liberal MP told Guardian Australia Entsch had “loudly and proudly claimed last year that after 19 years of defending the LGBTIQ+ community he would not sell them out on religious freedom”. “But once he got his North Queensland reinsurance scheme, his objections evaporated.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Entsch rejected the charge, noting the reinsurance pool was announced in the May 2021 budget, shortly after he promised to recontest the 2022 election. Details of the design of the scheme were finalised and announced on 7 February, with minor changes to benefit strata properties and provide small business marine property insurance. “I’m not going to perpetuate this bullshit,” Entsch told Guardian Australia. “People can do their mischief but it has nothing whatsoever to do with the religious discrimination bill.” Asked if he offered “cover” to junior MPs, Entsch said he “did, over time” but decided to bank successes on the religious bill because he could see his own party room wouldn’t shift and Labor would support the bill anyway. “They were trying to jam us – and that’s exactly what they did. You’ve got to know when you’d be able to win and when you’ll lose.” On Sunday Scott Morrison said he was “devastated” by the failure to deliver the religious discrimination bill, claiming the government had shelved it because he “would rather lay down our attempt to secure those additional [religious] protections than see them compromised or undermined” by protections for LGBTQ+ students, which conservatives claim would harm schools’ ability to set rules enforcing their religious views. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said on Monday that Labor would “deal with” religious discrimination legislation if elected. “We think that everyone should be free from discrimination. That includes people of faith,” he said. “You can do that without increasing discrimination against others.” Albanese said the government legislation “was not consistent with what the prime minister himself said would happen last year and put in writing to me in December” when he promised to prevent “any form of discrimination against a student on the basis of sexuality or gender identity”. On Monday the assistant attorney general, Amanda Stoker, confirmed the religious discrimination bill was “something we’ll have to revisit post-election”. Stoker said she was “certainly surprised to find that people other than Ms Archer and Mr Zimmerman acted as they did” in crossing the floor. The deputy Liberal leader, Josh Frydenberg, told ABC Radio he had consulted Martin “ahead of that vote” and acknowledged she was in a difficult position. “I would like all our members of our team to stick together when it comes to votes on the floor of the house – but at the same time I want to see her re-elected in her seat.” Frydenberg confirmed “there was an understanding that there would be more support than there was on the floor of the house, but that’s now behind us”. On Friday Martin responded to claims she had breached a commitment to the government by saying: “I protected the human rights of our most vulnerable in our parliament. I did what was right. I supported the religious discrimination bill, I supported people of faith and I protected the rights of vulnerable young students. To me, that was the right balance.”",News/Australia news,Warren Entsch accused of failing to back Liberal MPs on religious discrimination amendments,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/14/warren-entsch-accused-of-failing-to-back-liberal-mps-on-religious-discrimination-amendments
2/14/2022,"Three candidates have emerged as frontrunners to replace Leigh Sales as the host of 7.30 – David Speers, Bridget Brennan and Sarah Ferguson – as the ABC prepares its flagship current affairs program for a new era. Speers, the current host of Sunday morning’s political panel show Insiders, and Brennan, the broadcaster’s Indigenous affairs editor, are two contenders the ABC is seriously considering alongside Ferguson, Guardian Australia understands.  ABC chiefs have approached potential hosts after Sales announced on Thursday she would step down as 7.30’s anchor in late June following the federal election – some 12 years after taking over from Kerry O’Brien. Speers, who joined the ABC from Sky News in early 2020 when he was picked to replace longtime Insiders host Barry Cassidy, is understood to be viewed as a safe option for the broadcaster. This is in part because of his two decades in the federal parliamentary press gallery as political editor of Sky and his reputation as a sharp interviewer. However, Brennan – a former Europe correspondent for the ABC based in London – has already been unofficially approached about replacing Sales. A source says a senior ABC figure discussed the role with Brennan in recent days and asked her to consider throwing her hat into the ring. Ferguson, a longtime ABC journalist who has worked as a foreign correspondent for the broadcaster as well as prominent international outlets, has also been widely floated as a potential replacement. Ferguson is without a permanent role given she has been unable to take up the position of Beijing bureau chief due to diplomatic tensions. Laura Tingle, the veteran chief political correspondent for 7.30 who has become a regular fill-in host for Sales, is not currently understood to be a top contender. However, if Tingle remains in her prominent role on 7.30 with Brennan as host, it could be seen to bolster the political credentials of the team while gaining from Brennan’s experience as Indigenous affairs editor. A little bit speechless at @leighsales news, enormous congratulations to you for an incredible 12 years at @abc730 Despite Speers’s senior status and the fact Brennan has not worked in a dedicated political reporting role, her experience across various ABC bureaux – including covering Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities for more than a decade – has her well-placed to assume the position. Brennan – a Dja Dja Wurrung and Yorta Yorta woman – has been a regular fill-in host on ABC TV’s breakfast program since returning from a two-year stint with the broadcaster in London. She first joined the ABC in 2010, when she began a cadetship, before moving to its Darwin bureau. Speers is based in Melbourne, where he moved with his family from Canberra to take the Insiders job. Sales has lived and worked in Sydney, where 7.30 is filmed, however, it is understood that would not be a deciding factor in selecting a new host. Guardian Australia understands the ABC is unlikely to make an official decision on Sales’ replacement until after the broadcaster announces its new director of news. The ABC is yet to announce who will take over from Gaven Morris more than four months after he resigned after six years in the job. Guardian Australia asked the ABC if it had a timeframe to appoint replacements for Morris and Sales but a spokesperson declined to comment. Stan Grant, the ABC’s international affairs analyst, and Virginia Trioli, the host of mornings on ABC radio in Melbourne and a former News Breakfast host, have also been touted as potential new anchors at 7.30.",News/Media,Bridget Brennan joins David Speers and Sarah Ferguson as top contender to host 7.30,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/14/bridget-brennan-joins-david-speers-and-sarah-ferguson-as-top-contenders-to-host-730
2/14/2022,"Friends has been stripped of its lesbian storyline for the Chinese re-release of the sitcom, prompting censorship concerns. On Friday a number of entertainment platforms including Tencent – which made headlines earlier this month for carrying a version of Fight Club with a totally different ending – began airing the first season of Friends, which was originally broadcast in 1994.  Fans who had seen the programme before were quick to notice the absence of several scenes, including those relating to the character Ross explaining that his ex-wife, Carol, is gay. Other viewers reported cuts or mistranslations of lines by LGBTQI characters or scenes that included mildly suggestive references to strip clubs and orgasms. On China’s Weibo the apparent censorship became a trending topic, with tens of millions of views of related hashtags and comments. “Covering your mouth and ears does not mean non-existence,” said one user, while another wondered how the censors would treat a storyline in later seasons, of Phoebe acting as a surrogate for her brother and his partner. One viewer praised the show for having portrayed LGBTQI characters in “a natural and normal way” at a time when few other pop culture products were. “On the other hand, in today’s China, under a similar environment, not only is there no TV drama with high popularity and high reputation, which can insert gay characters into the play in a similar way, but even introduced foreign TV shows don’t dare to completely show gay content,” they said. “I don’t understand why this line was cut, why it’s still the same here after 30 years, we are even going backwards.” The backlash was itself soon censored and replaced with a more positive “why is Friends so popular” hashtag. Friends is hugely popular in China and was previously streamed online and uncensored until 2018. DVDs of the show are also widely available. However, there has been an apparent rise in censorship of entertainment in recent years, in an increasingly politically sensitive environment under Xi Jinping, which has also targeted non-traditional family values and culture. Guidelines first introduced in 2016 banning the depiction of gay people on TV, as well as presentation of extramarital affairs and one night stands, have tightened further. Last year regulators ordered broadcasters to avoid what it called “abnormal aesthetics”, and “sissy men”. LGBTQI online accounts, university groups, and publications have been shut down. Foreign productions have also struggled to gain access to China. Major Hollywood blockbusters, including the recent Marvel film Shang-Chi, have been denied releases apparently over perceived slights to China or its government. Earlier this month the discovery that the plot of Fight Club had been changed on Tencent to tell viewers police had “rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals” sparked widespread backlash and subsequent restoration of the original ending. Scenes were also cut from Bohemian Rhapsody, the 2019 film about Queen and Freddie Mercury, before its theatrical release in Chinese cinemas.",News/World news,Chinese fans claim censorship as gay storylines removed from Friends,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/chinese-fans-claim-censorship-as-gay-storylines-removed-from-friends
2/14/2022,"When I first saw Eugene Ashe’s Sylvie’s Love at the Sundance film festival in January 2020, I remember not so much exiting the theater as floating. “That,” I said to anyone listening, “will surely be a smash, and end up swimming in Oscar nominations.” Well, I was right to a degree on the first part – critics did praise the film – but the coronavirus pandemic nixed its theatrical release, and its end-of-year debut on Amazon Prime did not connect on a mainstream level as it should have.  But one good thing about movies that are owned (and not merely licensed) by the major streamers is that they never go away. To that end, if you subscribe to Amazon you’ve done more than just underwrite Jeff Bezos’s jaunts to space. You’ve secured yourself access to one of the loveliest films of the last five years. Sylvie’s Love is made for people who watch older movies and sigh “they don’t make ‘em like that any more”. Its classic nature is woven into its very look, shot, as it is, on the Super 16mm film format, and on backlot sets that clearly aren’t New York City, but not in a hyper-stylized or campy way. Put bluntly, it looks the way films looked when this story is set, the late 1950s and early 1960s. There is, of course, one major differentiator: the lead performers are Black. Tessa Thompson and Nnamdi Asomugha star as the cosmically misaligned lovers hit with unfair obstacles separating them from the happiness they deserve. Even though this is a period piece, the struggle of living in a racist country during the civil rights era is only part of the din of these character’s lives, not the focus. As Ashe put it in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, “all I have to do is open up my family photo albums to see a very different depiction of Black life in the 60s.” It’s a film that, tragically, would have never gotten the funding back then, so it has to be made now. When we first meet Thompson’s Sylvie, she is working in a Harlem record shop owned by her father (Lance Reddick, who really lights up the room in every scene he’s in). One day in walks Robert, a young saxophonist, looking for the album Brilliant Corners by Thelonious Monk. (He’s heard that “Newk” – a nickname for Sonny Rollins – is on it.) Soon he’s working at the shop and, in classic sitcom fashion, the pair end up connecting while locked in the basement after hours. That may sound corny, but it’s driven by the script. As much as Robert is destined for greatness with his music, Sylvie has her own dream of becoming a television producer. Thompson and Asomugha’s romantic sparkle would make a stone swoon, and as their summer fling grows more passionate (mirrored by supporting players Aja Naomi Kim and Regé-Jean Page), the film makes great use of chaste dissolves. It’s not that I’m a cinematic prude, it’s just that some movies call for a little tact. This is nothing if not a classy production. For 45 minutes or so, Sylvie’s Love is a warm, blissful bath of to-die-for costumes, heart-melting glances, and loads of great music. There’s original small combo jazz written by Fabrice Lecomte and performed by Mark Turner, plus hits of the era from people like Nancy Wilson, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Jackie Wilson. Even a corny, early rock’n’roll track by Bill Haley and His Comets (See You Later, Alligator) is, begrudgingly at first, given its due for being a snappy, catchy tune. (Its silly lyrics eventually become poignant, and if that isn’t a testimony to the magic of this film, I don’t know what is.) But then complications set in, with miscommunication and bad timing the cause of it all. The rest of the film’s running time is spent wondering just when the heck fate will cut our two lovers a break and let them have their happily ever after. One of the many things I love about this movie (and I know I mentioned the costumes, but, oh man, the costumes) is how true to itself the film’s style remains. It could have easily devolved into hammy, over-the-top performances, but Thompson and Asomugha are committed to playing it cool. He’s a sensitive guy who’d much rather express himself with his instrument than his words (I was surprised to learn he had a previous career playing American football) and she’s simply luminous in every scene. It doesn’t take much for you to root for these people. Though it is set in the worlds of classic jazz and early television, Ashe doesn’t waste time with any thinly veiled references to real life figures. There is only one exception, a bit of a gift to jazzbos, with Jemima Kirke’s patron character “the Countess” – a sly reference to Baroness Nica de Koenigswarter. The aim to become an instant classic is achieved, and without any shortcuts. You’ll love it.
