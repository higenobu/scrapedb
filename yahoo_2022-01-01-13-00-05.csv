1/1/2022,"DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran's space launch on Thursday failed to put its three payloads into orbit after the rocket was unable to reach the required speed, a defence ministry spokesman said in remarks carried on state television on Friday. The attempted launch, which came as indirect U.S.-Iran talks take place in Austria to try to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal, drew criticism from the United States, Germany and France. ""For a payload to enter orbit, it needs to reach speeds above 7,600 (metres per second). We reached 7,350,"" the spokesman, Ahmad Hosseini, said in a documentary about the launch vehicle broadcast on state TV and posted online. On Thursday, Hosseini did not clarify whether the devices had reached orbit, but suggested the launch was a test ahead of coming attempts to put satellites into orbit. Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programmes in the Middle East, has suffered several failed satellite launches in the past few years due to technical issues. Washington has said it is concerned by Iran’s development of space launch vehicles, and a German diplomat said Berlin had called on Iran to stop sending satellite launch rockets into space, adding that they violated a U.N. Security Council resolution. [bL1N2TF0B4] France said on Friday the rocket launch aimed at sending three research devices into space violated U.N. rules and was ""even more regrettable"" as nuclear talks with world powers were making progress. Iran's foreign ministry rejected the U.S., German and French criticism of Tehran's launch of the satellite-carrying rocket. ""Scientific and research advances, including in the field of aerospace, are the inalienable right of the Iranian people, and such meddling statements will not undermine the Iranian people's determination to make progress in this field,"" it said in a statement carried by state media. Tehran denies that its space activity is a cover for ballistic missile development or that it violated a U.N. resolution. A U.N. resolution in 2015 ""called upon"" Iran to refrain for up to eight years from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons following an agreement with six world powers. Some states said the language did not make such a pledge obligatory. Iran says it has never pursued the development of nuclear weapons and, therefore, the resolution does not apply to its ballistic missiles, which Tehran regards as an important deterrent and retaliatory force against U.S. and other adversaries in the event of war. Iran launched its first satellite Omid (Hope) in 2009, and its Rasad (Observation) satellite was sent into orbit in 2011. Tehran said in 2012 that it had successfully put its third domestically made satellite, Navid (Promise), into orbit. In April 2020, Iran said it successfully put the country's first military satellite into orbit, following repeated failed launch attempts in previous months. The United States imposed sanctions on Iran's civilian space agency and two research organisations in 2019, saying they were being used to advance Tehran's ballistic missile programme.

1/1/2022,"If you have a truck with a ""squat"" modification, the look is now illegal in North Carolina as of Dec. 1 and owners have already been sent to court if in violation. Craven County Sheriff's Office is buckling down on the new law and owners of these custom vehicles have been issued warning and court citations from deputies. Maj. David McFadyen of the sheriff's office said it is unclear how many citations or court orders were given because the office does not keep those statistics. ""Every time an individual is observed operating a vehicle in violation of the statute, they're gonna receive a citation,"" he said. ""If they get that first citation and they don't correct it and they're caught on the road again, they're gonna get another citation."" Two citations have been issued with the New Bern Police Department, said Lt. Donald McInnis by email. Anyone who violates the statute three or more times risk having their driver's license revoked for a year minimum. McFadyen said individuals could be fined in court or sent with a warning that requires the truck owners to provide proof the modification was corrected. Blake Peffley, salesman of Jacksonville's OCC Auto Truck Accessories, said people have called to remove the modification, but not as much as he expected. ""Some of those trucks that were squatted weren't the safest,"" he said. ""A lot of them weren't built correctly and they weren't really safe on the road, but people are gonna do what they want to do."" Peffley said shops normally do not ""squat"" trucks and instead drivers achieve it themselves. ""They would just remove some of the components at the rear of the truck and make it squat,"" he said. ""It’s pretty easy to do. All you do is remove the block out of the rear of the truck and then it makes it sit lower in the back."" Gov. Roy Cooper signed the ""Carolina Squat"" law in August, which passed on Dec. 1 making the after-market popular modification banned in the state. The law states this prohibits a private passenger vehicle, including those registered out of state, from being driven on a highway or public vehicular area if the height of the front fender of the car is, by alteration of the suspension, frame, or body, 4 or more inches greater than the height of the rear fender as measured from the ground, through the centerline of the wheel, to the bottom of the fender. The safety problem with the modification is when the front of the vehicle is raised, drivers vision is limited causing them to not see down the road or cars in front of the truck. ""I'm surprised we did not see more vehicle accidents than we did with those vehicles,"" McFadyen said. One year ago a petition was created to make the truck modification illegal and it has over 71,000 signatures. Their goal was 75,000. The petitioners argued ""these trucks blind people with their headlights pointed to the sky and show zero care for others safety."" Another petition was created going against making the ""squat"" look illegal stating ""we like it and if it (ain't) tooted up we don’t want it."" The petition almost reached it's 25,000 signature goal with over 24,000 people who agreed. Drivers can still have the squat look in private lot areas, such as a car show. ""They can have the modification as long as they don't operate it on the highway or public vehicle area,"" McFadyen said. ""A lot of the modifications are done from folks who like to enter their vehicles in these car shows with modified vehicles."" McFadyen said months before the law passed, he has seen fewer lowered trucks on the road than he has in the past, but they are still an issue of concern. ""We will be working with the owners of those vehicles to ensure they comply with the law,"" he said.
