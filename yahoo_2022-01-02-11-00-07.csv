1/2/2022,"Rapper Kodak Black was arrested on a trespassing charge Saturday in South Florida, authorities said. The Broward Sheriff’s Office said Black was taken into custody in his hometown of Pompano Beach early Saturday morning, according to the South Florida SunSentinel. Investigators did not immediately release details about what prompted the arrest. Black, whose legal name is Bill Kapri, later posted bond and was released, the newspaper reported. Neither his publicist nor his attorney immediately returned an emailed request for comment. Black had a three-year federal prison sentence for falsifying documents used to buy weapons at a Miami gun store commuted by President Donald Trump on his last day in office in 2020. He had served about half his sentence. He was later sentenced to probation last April for assaulting a teenage girl in a South Carolina hotel room. Black was originally charged with rape, but accepted a deal and pleaded guilty to first-degree assault. Black has sold over 30 million singles and has had several multiplatinum and platinum-certified singles, including “Zeze,” “No Flockin’” and “Roll in Peace.”",U.S./Associated Press,Rapper Kodak Black arrested on trespassing charge in Florida,https://news.yahoo.com/rapper-kodak-black-arrested-trespassing-000633284.html
1/2/2022,"CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Members of the Russian and Czech Republic world junior hockey teams were removed from a New Year’s Eve flight from Calgary to Frankfurt, Germany, with fellow passengers saying the Russian squad caused a disturbance by smoking and refusing to wear masks. Calgary Police said in a statement Saturday that its Airport Unit officers responded at 5:45 p.m. Friday to reports of a disturbance on an Air Canada flight. The statement did not say who caused the disturbance or if there were any arrests, and police did not respond to requests from The Canadian Press for further information. Air Canada also had yet to respond to a request for information. The team members were heading home from the junior championships in Red Deer and Edmonton that were canceled Wednesday because of COVID-19 outbreaks. “The team of the Czech Republic and Russia was removed from the flight for violating the mask regime. Very strict rules,” Russian coach Sergei Zubov told Russian newspaper Izvestia. Czech team manager Otakar Cerny said his team was likely coupled in with the Russians by the flight crew because of the similarity of their gray sweatshirts. “And practically only for that reason, they threw us into the same bag as the Russians and told us that the entire Czech and Russian expedition could no longer board the plane,” Cerny told Czech media. “Air Canada representatives apologized to us and at their expense arranged a hotel and a flight to Frankfurt at the same time a day later. They also assured us that we would not fly the same flight as the Russian hockey players.” Eoin Kenny, a passenger on the flight who was in business class, said one Russian official who was seated near him was vaping in the cabin and refused to put his mask up over his mouth and nose. The flight attendants tried over and over to get him to comply with the rules, Kenny said, but the man refused. “He was blaring Russian rock music on his phone,"" Kenny told The Canadian Press from the airport in Madrid. “They kept trying to get him to turn it off but he wouldn’t. I think they were over-refreshed.” The players on the Russian team, Kenny said, were seated back in economy and at one point another Russian man came forward and embraced the passenger who was causing the disturbance. Dr. Kathleen Scherf was among a number of passengers who tweeted during the disturbance that delayed the flight three hours. “Two hours late so far on Calgary to Frankfurt flight. The Russian Juniors team was in back, trying to smoke cigarettes, not wearing masks, not listening to attendants,” Scherf tweeted. “Cops swarmed the plane. We all had to get off while they and their luggage were removed.”",World/Associated Press,"Russian, Czech junior hockey teams removed from plane",https://news.yahoo.com/russian-czech-junior-hockey-teams-005023720.html
1/2/2022,"The chief medical officer for Johnston Health and his family got an unwelcome COVID-19 surprise over the Christmas holidays, and he’s using the experience to remind colleagues how tricky the illness can be and how important it is to get vaccinated. In an email sent to about 2,200 Johnston Health employees, Dr. Rodney McCaskill said that in almost two years of the pandemic, he and his household masked, social-distanced, got vaccinated and boosted to the degree possible, and managed to avoid getting COVID-19. Then the holidays hit. “My son, like many invincible 26-year-olds, drove all night from Florida and arrived last Saturday morning, a week before Christmas,” McCaskill wrote. The son was tired for the first couple of days of his visit, then developed congestion the family attributed to allergies. But his symptoms worsened through the week with the onset of a cough and chills. “He began to feel better on Christmas Eve but then I developed a dry throat,” McCaskill wrote, adding that he still didn’t suspect COVID. Only after his son returned to Florida and McCaskill developed other mild symptoms, including achy joints, fatigue, congestion and a slight hoarseness in his voice, did he get tested at his wife’s urging. “I had convinced myself that because my symptoms were minimal that most likely this was Adenovirus or some other mild viral cold,” McCaskill wrote. On getting a positive COVID test result, McCaskill said, “I must say that I was a bit shocked. I immediately went home to quarantine. I actually felt fairly normal and had lots of nervous energy so I decided to paint part of the deck. At that point my only symptoms were slight nasal congestion and mild hoarseness of my voice. Since then I have been mostly asymptomatic so I have been working out in the yard during my quarantine.” In the email and in a phone interview, McCaskill said that over the course of the holiday, his two youngest children also developed minor symptoms, while an older, unvaccinated son had been sick for several days. “I share this story because I feel that the vaccine and booster shots are most likely the reason why I and my vaccinated family have had minimal symptoms,” McCaskill said. “My son from Florida had been vaccinated in January but did not get the booster shot and he is still coughing and feels short of breath when going up stairs. My other son who chose not to be vaccinated is still sick in bed. I have minimal symptoms and feel great. My vaccinated family is well. “My advice to all of you during this new surge is to get the vaccine and booster shot,” McCaskill said. Johnston Health, in Smithfield, is part of UNC Health. Alan Wolf, spokesman for the system, said its hospitals were caring for 355 COVID patients as of Saturday morning, up from a low of 77 just before Thanksgiving. Johnston Health had increased from a low of six COVID patients in November to 45 on Saturday, Wolf said. Health officials say that most of those hospitalized with COVID have not been fully vaccinated. On Friday, the state Department of Health and Human Services reported 19,174 new COVID-19 cases, up from 18,571 the day before. The highest single-day jump in cases was previously recorded at 11,581 in January. As with the original form of COVID-19 and the delta variant, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has said scientists believe that anyone with the omicron variant can spread the virus to others, even if they are vaccinated and have no symptoms.",Health/Raleigh News and Observer,Local hospital’s chief medical officer got COVID-19 for Christmas and urges vaccination,https://news.yahoo.com/local-hospital-chief-medical-officer-222508541.html
