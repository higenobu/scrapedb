2/6/2022,"South Dakota Republicans haven’t lost a statewide election since 2008. They have slapped Democrats around in just about every campaign, even running unopposed for a U.S. Senate seat in 2010 and U.S. House seat in 2020. Now it seems like they’re so desperate for a good fight that they’ve picked several among themselves. Gov. Kristi Noem, who has been riding high in polls in her state, has never lost an election. She served four terms in Congress before being elected governor in 2018. The South Dakota legislature has supermajorities in both chambers, with Republicans holding 94 of 105 seats. No Democrat holds statewide office. But Noem has suddenly found plenty of opponents with whom to wage bitter political battles: fellow Republicans. Conversations with experts and political insiders from both parties suggest that while it’s far too early to suggest she’s in danger of losing her re-election bid this fall, Noem may emerge bloodied, with any national ambitions in some jeopardy. University of South Dakota political science professor Michael Card told The Daily Beast that Noem has raised hackles in part by the very nature of how she performs duties essential to her job. Specifically, he pointed to her repeatedly referring to South Dakota issues with terms like “my bill” and “my budget” in a state with old-school lawmakers who like to maintain their fiefdoms. When one of her staff members referred to the “governor’s budget” this week, Card noted, a normally mild-mannered lawmaker “snapped” and said it was the legislature’s budget, not her own. “I think that’s symptomatic of a lot of what’s going on,” he said. “It’s her brand, not the state.” A spokesperson for Noem declined to comment for this story. State political insiders suggest Noem is basically alone in Pierre, and that even if she remains beloved by large swaths of the Republican base, her image has taken a serious dent among the very people she needs to get things done. “She doesn’t have any friends,” a longtime Republican insider and observer of South Dakota politics told The Daily Beast. Perhaps most remarkably, Noem is sparring with the current GOP speaker of the state legislature, Rep. Spencer Gosch. Kristi Noem Still Doesn’t Understand How COVID and Vaccines Work Last Wednesday, Noem asked for a “heartbeat bill”—a far-right project that purports to ban abortion if a fetal heartbeat can be detected and has notoriously become law in states like Texas—to be introduced. Lawmakers declined, saying they wanted to see the outcome of pending litigation before federal courts. Noem called the move “unprecedented” and a betrayal of the pro-life movement. But Gosch argued the package presented by the governor wasn’t a bill in final form, referring to it as “notes,” even as Noem insisted it was a bill ready for introduction onto the House floor. On Thursday, Noem told reporters that she and Gosch had a personality conflict and she wasn’t sure how to resolve it. “I’m screwed either way, no matter what I say,” Noem said. “He’s looking for a reason to blame me for everything and it’s weird because we agree on probably 90 percent of policy issues. There’s something, some reason this guy doesn’t like me and it seems like a personal agenda, but I don’t know what it is.” In a Thursday press conference, she said she gets along with other legislative leaders but has a “strained” relationship with the speaker. In his own statement Thursday, Gosch referred to Noem’s congressional career and her reputation as a fierce political fighter. “As for the personal attacks, D.C. politics are not welcome here,” he said. “South Dakotans deserve better from their elected officials, and that’s what they can expect from their legislature as we continue the crucial work of ending abortion in America.” Policy fights aside, Noem is also under pressure thanks to a pair of investigations into her past conduct—some of which have been set off by members of her own party. An ongoing Government Accountability Board investigation requested by GOP Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg has two prongs. One is Noem’s use of state airplanes for multiple trips out of state to appear at conservative political gatherings. For months, the governor has claimed she needed to keep details of her travels private for security reasons. Now the Republican-dominated legislature is interested in digging into those trips. Noem also has taken heat for her involvement in her daughter Kassidy Peter’s efforts to obtain a real estate appraiser license from the state. That led to a meeting between the governor, the state employee who oversaw the process, that employee’s boss, and other officials—as well as Noem’s daughter—as the Associated Press reported. Sherry Bren—the employee who ran the state agency in charge of certifying licenses—claimed she was told to retire later that year. She subsequently filed an age discrimination lawsuit against the state, but dropped it after receiving a $200,000 settlement. Card argued the entire process just “fails the smell test.” And he’s far from alone in suggesting the governor’s tactics are catching up with her. Northern State University political science professor Jon D. Schaff told The Daily Beast that, based on what he is told by people in Pierre, Noem has brought a lot of this on herself. “To use a basketball term, it seems from the beginning Kristi Noem has had wide elbows. She’s been aggressively pushing her agenda and is willing to ‘throw elbows’ to get it done,” Schaff said. “Perhaps she is a bit indiscriminate in who she’s elbowing, including members of her own ‘team.’” The tension in Pierre has pulled back the curtain on a broader dynamic of Noem’s relationship with state officials. She keeps odd hours, does a lot of work in her official residence, and doesn’t invest much time or effort in getting to know legislators, multiple sources told The Daily Beast. State Sen. Reynold Nesiba, a Sioux Falls Democrat, argued the feuding and bickering among Republicans has served to expose Noem’s basic weakness. ""She’s not very good at being governor,” Nesiba, the lawmaker who asked Attorney General Ravnsborg to investigate Noem’s use of state airplanes last year, told The Daily Beast. The perception that her ambitions go well beyond the confines of the state may also be hurting Noem among key players in both parties. That tension is a rite of passage for any politician with national aspirations, but insiders say Noem is having a rough go of it so far. The governor has raised eyebrows by touring the country, appearing at conservative gatherings and being interviewed on national TV shows, according to the Republican insider. It’s seen as a way for her to boost her national profile in hopes of landing on the Republican ticket in 2024 or down the road. At the same time, the South Dakota GOP veteran said, she doesn’t invite legislators over to her Pierre house for steaks, drinks, and political gabfests. It’s a change in how previous governors operated, the insider argued. Lawmakers hungry for personal attention aside, Noem’s beef with Attorney General Ravnsborg somehow keeps getting worse. Ravnsborg is himself caught up in an impeachment process because he killed a man with his car in 2020. If he is removed from office, Noem would name his replacement. That’s one reason the legislature has been slow to act on impeachment, not wanting to give Noem more power, the Republican insider suggested. But Noem has aggressively called for Ravnsborg to resign since his role in ending another man’s life became clear, and also has urged the legislature to move forward on impeachment. The push to remove him took on a new tenor in recent days when Gosch and other legislators said they were deluged with scores of phone calls urging them to impeach. The calls were traced to Grand Solutions, Inc., in Warren, Ohio, a telemarketing company. A recording from one of the Grand Solution callers to a South Dakotan also included an odd discussion, apparently in the Ohio firm’s boiler room, during a call that mentioned Ravnsborg. “I don’t know. I was on the phone. I just gave him an update and the governor called. They’re going to call me back,” the caller was heard saying. “The governor is actually involved in this so that is why it is more specific. But it is nice because this person is running for president, I don’t know if they’re running for Democrat or Republican …” It is not clear that the “governor” referred to on the call was Noem. Jonathan Petrea, a spokesperson for Angel Kane, who is listed as having incorporated the telemarketing firm, told Dakota News Now that no politician or political organization was behind the calls. He declined to say who paid for them when contacted by The Daily Beast. “I don’t have anything more to add,” he said. A phone number for Grand Solutions had been disconnected. Gosch, in a statement issued Jan. 27, said the calls were highly suspicious. “It is clear to me that whoever is behind this movement is trying to impede, influence, or taint the ongoing investigation of this committee,"" he said. ""We are looking into who is behind this.” Noem has insisted she had no involvement with the calls, and has no idea who is behind them. “I don’t, other than the speaker is the one who told me about them and made me aware,” she said on Jan. 27. Noem campaign manager Joe Desilets has likewise said neither the governor nor her campaign were linked to these calls. “There is no wiggle room, no doubt, [that neither] the campaign nor the governor directed this, wanted this, authorized it, paid for it, anything at all,” Desilets told Dakota News Now. A state House special investigative committee considering impeachment proceedings against Ravnsborg has announced plans to investigate the calls. The head of that committee? Speaker Gosch. Still, Noem remains a popular figure among the general public in the state. A poll conducted last fall showed her with a solid base of support, with 61.2 percent approval. South Dakota State University political science associate professor David L. Wiltse said Noem’s “feud” problem was not unique to South Dakota politics. He noted that polling he has done shows deepening partisan divides in the state, with the majority of Republicans strongly supporting Noem. So even as her fellow political elites may be turning on her, Wiltse advised critics to go slow on preparing her political obituary. “It is clear that she is in good standing, and I doubt her re-election is in jeopardy,” he said. Card, who served in state government under four-term Republican Gov. Bill Janklow, said he, too, believes Noem remains a favorite to win a second term. But, he argued, that is no longer a “slam dunk.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

2/6/2022,"As board-certified pain medicine specialist Dr. Ari B. Lerner explained to BuzzFeed, ""When pain is sustained in this way due to a known or unknown cause, it can become chronic."" The experts are: • Dr. Ari B. Lerner, board-certified pain medicine specialist and board-certified anesthesiologist at Pain Management Specialist of New York. • Dr. Carla Marie Manly, clinical psychologist and author of Joy from Fear. • Dr. Mary Charles Haigler, doctor who specializes in orofacial pain and obstructive sleep apnea treatment. ""In short, a chronic pain condition affects all aspects of a person's life from their physical well-being to their social and spiritual life,"" Dr. Lerner told BuzzFeed. ""There is a feeling of isolation and loneliness when trying to cope with the condition. With the support of friends, family, and caring professionals, they should feel a sense of hope knowing they are not in this alone."" Dr. Manly refers to this as a type of ""healthy emotional support."" Since chronic pain can affect one's self-esteem and feelings of general self-worth, Dr. Manly says, ""Offering nonjudgmental emotional support is often the most critical component of supporting someone who lives with chronic pain."" So while you may have the itch to throw every solution you know out there, it can become overwhelming for your loved one to hear. Yes, it might be coming from a thoughtful place, but sometimes, loved ones with chronic illnesses just need to feel validated — and the best way to do this is by simply listening to their worries and concerns. According to Dr. Lerner, while being sympathetic with your words is nice, showing ""empathy with action"" is more meaningful and can even ""enhance a chronic pain patient's life and interpretation of their pain."" You can do this by ""helping them with basic tasks that they may find difficult,"" she explains. ""If the person has a physical disability coinciding with their pain, you may need to make things more accessible in their home and environment so they can continue to care for themselves. If they're unable to care for themselves, they may need assistance from their medical doctor and possibly a social worker to obtain the support they need, such as a home health aide or in-house therapy and nursing care."" Dr. Haigler adds by saying that you can even offer a specific gift or service: ""[You can] provide a meal, offer to pick up their children, or run an errand. [This] may be easier [for them] to accept than an open offer of 'let me know if you need anything.'"" However, make sure to check in with your loved one before doing these tasks to see if they would actually like or need help in these areas of their life. While some chronic pain sufferers would appreciate the help, others might prefer to reach out themselves if they need anything. ""Don’t assume that I can’t do something, whether it's a physical task. For a physical task, I’ll ask if I need help,"" says Megan, 34, from Chicago. The only way you'll know how to best support them this way is by simply asking them what they prefer, and then continue doing that requested boundary. One of the toughest things people with chronic pain — especially those who are living with invisible illnesses — go through is being invalidated by others about their pain and life. ""I think people with chronic pain, like myself, worry a lot about whether or not others in our lives believe us or think we're exaggerating,"" said a BuzzFeed reader who wanted to remain anonymous. ""It's the opposite. We're downplaying our pain....We're so used to coping that we might seem fine even when we're in a lot of pain."" According to Dr. Haigler, these assumptions about pain tend to happen because ""most people have trouble understanding that pain can affect life on many levels."" That's why she suggests letting your loved one know that ""you care, that you believe that their condition is real, and that you see how it's affecting them."" Even though you may know your loved one like the back of your hand, it's important to be curious about how they feel and not assume what their pain feels like on any given day. ""Since those who live with chronic pain may feel very different on a day-to-day basis, it’s wise to do gentle check-ins,"" says Dr. Manly. One of the ways you can do a gentle check-in is by simply asking about their pain level. ""I find it helpful to use rating systems, such as a 0 to 10 pain scale (0 = no pain, and 10 = the highest pain imaginable) that can be used to gain objective insight into a person’s needs,"" says Dr. Manly. Being aware of the amount of pain they're feeling will not only give you insight on how to best support them but also give you awareness of when not to take things too personally if they're not feeling 100 percent. Supporting a loved one often means becoming curious about their lives and their struggles. Rather than asking the go-to ""how are you"" question, Dr. Manly suggests asking open-ended questions to get a further understanding of how they are truly feeling. If you're not sure what kind of questions you should ask, Dr. Manly provided a few below. • Would a little bit of exercise make you feel better or worse? • Is your appetite strong today? Would you like a bowl of soup? • When your pain is high, what could I do to support you? • Do you prefer to be alone and quiet when you’re hurting so much, or do you prefer company? It's also important to keep in mind how they're responding to some of these questions. If they're changing the subject or keeping their answers short and sweet, it just might mean they're not in the mood to discuss their pain right then and there — and that's completely okay. Just respect their boundaries and talk about something else. ""In truth, those who suffer from chronic pain often have limited emotional energy and may feel depleted when asked to talk and engage,"" Dr. Manly says. ""That said, on 'up' days, there may be a desire for more engagement than on days that are particularly difficult and draining."" However, if you want to take things up a notch, you can also educate yourself about their chronic illness on your own time to help you further understand what they are going through. ""Feel free to educate yourself on our chronic illness,"" said a BuzzFeed reader who wished to remain anonymous. ""The fact that you have an idea of the condition we are dealing with for the rest of our lives, shows us you care about us."" While it's incredibly important to offer support, you also want to be mindful of how often you're offering advice or help, since, according to Dr. Manly, it's common for chronic pain suffers to become stressed about their ongoing health issues — and we, as loved ones, don't want to accidentally make things more stressful. ""A chronic pain sufferer can feel flooded or overwhelmed if offers of support are too frequent, intense, or demanding,"" says Dr. Manly. ""As such, it’s very important to tailor offers of support to the individual’s current needs and mental state."" Some of the ways you can tailor your support are by being mindful of their boundaries, asking open-ended questions, or asking about their pain level using the pain scale technique. When you're talking with a loved one who lives with chronic pain, try to remember to be mindful of discussing certain topics. For instance, Dr. Lerner says, ""This may not be the best time to talk about your latest vacation or activity you enjoyed, as it could only contribute to their sense of isolation as they may not be able to participate."" She adds: ""You should also avoid discussing that friend or acquaintance who had an injury but eventually recovered. Although this may seem like [you're] offering hope, it can be interpreted as them being the one poor soul who suffers while others recover."" Of course, this doesn't mean you can't talk about the happy things that are going on in your life, as your friend most likely wants to hear about them, but Dr. Lerner just emphasizes that when you're talking about their condition, it's can be more helpful to focus on how it's affecting them (if they feel comfortable talking about it), which can provide insight on how you can continue to provide support and take action. When someone develops chronic pain issues later in life, not only does their relationship with their body changes but also, the relationships they have with their loved ones can, too. That's why it's so important to still invite them out — even if you believe they will turn the event down. Why? Because it's not your job to make the choice for them. They're equipped to make this call themselves and they still want to feel included in your life. ""Please don’t stop inviting us to outings, even if it’s basically guaranteed we won’t feel like going,"" said Brittany. ""Losing that inclusion is a whole other pain that adds on to how much we struggle daily.""  If they do turn down an invite, please don't get upset. Having empathy and understanding for their pain is incredibly important not only for your relationship but also for their mental health, too. ""I've lost a lot of friends after they got annoyed because I kept canceling plans — they assumed I was just avoiding them,"" said knightowl86. ""I'm not just struggling to function because I'm in constant pain, [but I'm also] battling mental health issues."" Even though there are dozen of things you can do for someone who is living with chronic pain, one of the best things you can do is to simply show up again and again. According to the chronic pain sufferers who responded to a previous chronic pain post, one of the most common things that was said was that they don't want to feel like a burden to their loved ones. ""It can be hard to let friends and family in to support you without crossing the line of feeling like a 'burden,' explained Ari Negri, 26, from San Diego. ""Remember to check in. It can get really lonely dealing with [chronic pain] from day to day. Sometimes we just need to know that we’re still on our loved one’s minds."" But what exactly does ""showing up"" mean? To put it simply, it means not giving up on them. Period. ""I want people — mostly my parents right now — to stop giving up on me every time it gets hard,"" says a 30-year-old female from Chicago. ""It’s awful when your loved ones say: 'Maybe we’ll never get answers.' But that can never be an option for me. I’ve been fighting for two-thirds of my life to not feel this way. To accept that I will just have to live like this is unacceptable...So when my own family gives up like that, it’s really hurtful."" So instead of giving up — show up. ""Watch my stupid shows with me on bad days, don't judge if I haven't been able to shower or straighten my apartment for a few days, and offer to cook and or clean up a little bit.,"" said Chelsie Cash, 30, from Georgia. ""Small help goes SO far, and so much of chronic illness feel isolating.""",Health/BuzzFeed,"""Don't Say 'Let Me Know If You Need Anything'"": 9 Ways To Help A Loved One Who Is Living With Chronic Pain",https://news.yahoo.com/heres-support-partner-friend-loved-191602913.html
2/6/2022,"Last year was a breakthrough time for UFOs, as a landmark government report prompted the possibility of extraterrestrial visitors to finally be taken seriously by everyone from senators, to a former president, to the Pentagon. But 2022 could be even more profound, experts say, as the clamor for UFO disclosure and discovery continues to grow, and as new scientific projects bring us closer than ever to – potentially – discovering non-Earth life. Related: I’ve seen the saucers: Obama weighs in as US interest in UFOs rises In June, the Pentagon released a highly anticipated report on unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP), the now preferred nomenclature by some in the extraterrestrial community, which found more than 140 instances of UAPs that could not be explained. The report came after leaked military footage documented seemingly otherworldly happenings in the sky, and after testimony from navy pilots helped to somewhat destigmatize a subject that has long been defined by conspiracy theories and dubious sightings. All in all, the newly sincere approach to UFOs has longtime sky-watchers excited. “I’m confident that 2022 is going to be a seismic year for UFOs,” said Nick Pope, who spent the early 1990s investigating UFOs for the British ministry of defence. In Congress, where a bipartisan group of senators has been pushing for years for the government to release more information on UFOs, and from the US defense department and intelligence community, Pope said he senses “a genuine desire to grip the issue”. “I think we’ll see congressional hearings on UFOs,” Pope said. “I also think we’ll see the release of more US military photos and videos of UFOs, and associated documents. Some of this may come via whistleblowers, but much of it may be released by the government itself, either proactively, or in response to requests under the Freedom of Information Act. “Finally, I think we’ll see more high-calibre witnesses coming forward, including commercial airline pilots, military aircrew, radar operators, and intelligence officers with direct knowledge of this subject.” It was a group of pilots who brought the issue to the fore in 2021. In a breakthrough interview with 60 Minutes, members of the US Navy lined up to recall their experiences of encountering UFOs on America’s coasts. It happened so frequently that the encounters became commonplace, Ryan Graves, a retired navy pilot, told the CBS show. “Every day,” Graves said. “Every day for at least a couple years.” For years, pilots had refused to share tales of their UFO experiences, worried of being labeled kooks or being passed over for promotion. The account of the navy pilots was given credibility, however, by leaked military footage which showed an oval flying object near a US navy ship off San Diego, and separate videos which showed triangular-shaped objects buzzing around in the sky. The US government’s UFO report, released in June 2021, fueled more interest. The Pentagon studied 144 incidents reported by military pilots between 2004 and 2021 in preparing the report. Officials were able to explain one of the incidents – it was a balloon – but the rest remain a mystery. Since then the Pentagon, pushed by US senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Marco Rubio, has launched a new office for reporting and analyzing UFO reports, although some in the UFO community suspect the government to be less than forthcoming with its findings. Still, as the clamor for information has grown, so has interest from the scientific community, and in 2022 a slew of new projects will launch, specifically aimed at detecting alien life. Avi Loeb, the Frank B Baird Jr professor of science at Harvard University, is behind one of those. He is the head of the Galileo Project, which aims to establish a network of sophisticated telescopes which will scan the skies for extraterrestrial objects. The privately funded project, which involves more than 100 scientists, is building its first telescope system on the roof of the Harvard college observatory, and it will begin operating this summer. Loeb plans to make the projects’ findings publicly available. The telescope will use infra-red cameras to take 24/7 video of the sky, and is equipped with a radio sensor, an audio sensor and a magnetometer to detect non-visual objects. A computer will use artificial intelligence to analyze the data, ignoring objects like birds, drones, planes, and meteors, and paying extra attention to any objects “that are not human-made”, Loeb said. “We’re taking a road not taken so there may be low hanging fruit, that nobody else picked because it was not taken,” Loeb said. For all that UFO research may be becoming destigmatized, Loeb said the field is still looked down upon by some astrophysicists and other academics, which can turn off young scientists. “I really want the next generation to be free to discuss it, and for it to become part of the mainstream,” Loeb said. “My hope is that by getting a high resolution image of something unusual, or finding evidence for it, which is quite possible in the coming year or two, we will change it.” The Galileo Project also hopes to use data collected by Planet Labs, which uses a fleet of miniature satellites to image the entire Earth once a day. By both looking up and down, the likelihood of discovery is increased. Collaboration is important, Loeb said, as the search for UFOs to date has been quixotic at best. But those who claim the lack of evidence of extraterrestrials means that alien life does not exist are misguided, Loeb said. “It’s just like a fisherman on the beach, looking at the ocean, saying: ‘Where are all the fish? I don’t see anything?’” he said. “And obviously if you don’t use a fishing net you will not find anything.” Long-time space enthusiasts are also hopeful about the impact of the James Webb space telescope, the largest and most powerful of its kind, which Nasa launched in December 2021. When it begins operating this summer, the Webb telescope will enable astronomers to scan the skies, peering back to when the universe was first beginning to form, as well as help study exo-planets: worlds that circle other suns. These concerted efforts could make 2022 “a banner year”, Leonard David, author of Moon Rush: the New Space Race, and a journalist who has been reporting on the space industry for more than five decades, said. “It’s a great time to be alive. The bottom line is something’s coming. You can’t have that many people doing that much research and come up dry,” David said. “At some point we’re going to have a confluence of scientific data that supports the likelihood that we’re a pretty mundane place here on earth, and there’s a lot of alien civilizations that are out there. “We’ve got to start thinking we’re not alone. It’s: how crowded is it up there?” A frequent backdrop to any discussion of alien life is how it would affect humans here on earth. Some speculate that religions could be shaken to their core, or that there could be a mass existential crisis. David said that extraterrestrials, however, could be aware of us and be deliberately ignoring our planet, which would represent an equally devastating blow to the human sense of self-importance. “I don’t know exactly where the Earth fits in and why we would be on the receiving end of any attention,” he said. “We could be the dolts of the universe.”",Science/The Guardian,‘Something’s coming’: is America finally ready to take UFOs seriously?,https://news.yahoo.com/something-coming-america-finally-ready-080002526.html
