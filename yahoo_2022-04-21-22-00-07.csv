4/21/2022,"A Ukrainian military official said Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov's troops killed three Russian soldiers who rioted. Kadyrov's militia has a reputation for brutality and is reported to be fighting in Ukraine. Insider was unable to verify the claim, though it is one of numerous similar reports on low Russian morale. A Ukrainian official said that troops working for Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen Republic leader and ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, killed three Russian soldiers who did not want to fight in the Ukraine war. A number of Russian soldiers had rioted over a lack of promised pay in Polohy, a district in the southeastern Ukrainian region of Zaporizhzhia, according to an official statement attributed to regional military spokesperson Col. Ivan Arefyev. The statement, posted to Telegram on Wednesday, said that Ukrainian intelligence found that the soldiers in question ""were ready to surrender their weapons and go home."" But fighters answering to Kadyrov ""brutally killed"" three of the Russian soldiers, Arefyev's statement said. Insider has been unable to verify the incident, and did not immediately receive a response to enquiries to the Russian embassy in London and Chechnya's parliament. Kadyrov is a Putin loyalist who runs the quasi-autonomous region of Chechnya with an iron fist. His private militia — ""Kadyrovites"" as per the statement — are widely reported to have been fighting in support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Arefyev's report, if verified, would give a rare insight into the relationship between Kadyrov's forces and the Russian rank and file in this conflict. Kadyrov's troops have a reputation for ferocity that is frequently leveraged in Kremlin propaganda, according to the New Lines Institute think tank. Arefyev's statement follows a string of reports that a proportion of Russian soldiers are suffering low morale and reluctant to carry out Putin's military objectives in Ukraine. Some such reports originate with Ukrainian officials and are amplified as part of the country's war effort, and not all have been independently verified. Ukraine's Security Service on Wednesday tweeted audio purporting to be intercepted telephone conversations between frustrated Russian soldiers. In the audio, the voices suggest shooting a former colonel. They said they were left in a precarious situation with no weapons or supplies, and that they had been ordered to fire on civilians. ""We were like what the fuck, you know?"" says one voice. ""Fucking bastards … shoot that wanker first, right now, motherfucker,"" said another, in apparent reference to the colonel. The other can be heard agreeing, saying he would write ""a massive report"" when he got home. As with the report from Arefyev, Insider was unable to verify the authenticity of the recording. But others have emerged from independent sources. On March 23, the Ukrainian journalist Roman Tsymbaliuk reported that frustrated members of a Russian battalion ran over their colonel's legs in a tank, hospitalizing them. A senior Western official later told The Washington Post that they believed the colonel had been killed ""as a consequence of the scale of the losses taken by his own brigade."" In early April, lawyer Mikhail Benyash told the Financial Times that more than 1,000 Russian service members had contacted him after he agreed to represent three Russian national guardsmen who refused to fight in Ukraine. The Russian newspaper Pskovskaya Gubernia also reported on April 7 that 60 Russian paratroopers had refused to join the invasion. The paper has a reputation for independence within Russia's repressive media environment.

4/21/2022,"REYNOLDS COUNTY, Mo. — Don Kory owns 600 acres on either side of Johnson's Shut-Ins State Park. What was supposed to be a farm to enjoy retirement quickly turned into a nightmare 15 years ago. The culprit? Feral hogs. ""They destroy everything, literally, destroy everything,"" Kory said. Kory used to tend gardens on his farm. While others may lament about rabbits, squirrels or deer making off with a few vegetables, Kory said hogs would remake the land. ""You know what happens when the pigs come in?"" Kory asked. ""The whole entire garden is destroyed and plowed under in one night. We just gave up on gardens because you just couldn't have them anymore."" Kory called the Missouri Feral Hog Elimination Partnership and the Department of Conservation to tell them there were pigs on his property. ""If somebody would have told me I'm just gonna take 726 pigs off my property, I'd told them they were nuts,"" Kory said. ""But, since we started, that's how many I've taken off there."" When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Kory started gardening again. He built a corral and laid fencing to keep the feral hogs out. ""They come right out and root up into the fence and try to get through to the garden, but they don't get in,"" Kory said. While the garden is thriving now, Kory's diligence against the feral hogs remains constant. ""It's been a long, hard battle,"" Kory said. ""I didn't retire to become a pig trapper."" The Missouri Feral Hog Elimination Partnership includes more than 15 federal and state agencies along with agriculture and conservation organizations. The partnership killed 9,857 feral hogs in 2021, bringing the total number of hogs killed since 2016 to more than 54,000. For 2019, 10,495 hogs were killed and 12,635 in 2020. The partnership employs 10 full-time trappers along with educators through the University of Missouri's Extension Program. ""Whatever you do, don't give up,"" Kory said during a field day with the partnership in early April. ""Don't let loose now. It's not time to be complacent because in 18 months or two years, they will be right back to where we were and 10 years of hard labor is wasted."" Jason Jensen, incident commander of Feral Hog Operations for MDC, said the strategy to allow hunters to tackle the invasive species on their own wasn't working. ""The message that we delivered to shoot a hog on sight basically resulted in a hog-hunting culture that developed around that,"" Jensen said. More: Feral hogs wreak havoc on land, carry disease. Officials aim for 'elimination' of species. In 2016, the strategy changed. Jensen said MDC re-evaluated its messaging and closed its public land to feral hog hunting with the Corps soon following suit. The Forest Service closed Mark Twain National Forest to feral hog hunting in 2020. There are exceptions. Mark Twain and MDC property gives hunters a chance at bagging a feral hog if they have an unfilled deer or turkey tag, which is called an incidental take. Private landowners can hunt feral hogs on their property. ""There is a lot of art in trapping pigs,"" Jensen said during a field day at Johnson's Shut-Ins State Park. The art comes in the form of technology. Luke Miller is a USDA wildlife biologist and drone pilot. He pilots the drones to scout out where sounders, or herds of feral pigs, are located. This helps with targeted helicopter hunts. ""In a two-and-a-half-hour drone flight at night, I can scout thousands of acres where it would take months to go in there and bait and look for cameras or walk the mountain on foot and look for signs,"" Miller said. ""I can reduce that into one night what would take a couple, three, four months time of boots on the ground."" There are limits to using drones. Battery life lasts about 30 minutes and if it's too windy, the drones are grounded, Miller said. In addition to feral hogs being able to trigger traps, cameras are helping as well, Jensen said. ""Most of the traps we're currently using are mechanically activated, but we are using technology to our advantage,"" Jensen said. ""We're figuring out ways where we are able to use cellular enabled cameras more and more."" Jeff Reed owns 4,000 acres of farmland for row crop and cattle in Williamsville. The farm's own history involved raising pigs spanning a few decades. About 10 years ago, he noticed damage to his crops from feral hogs. Then, the problem exploded. Through the efforts by MDC trappers and the House Bill No. 369 being passed, Reed has seen a significant decrease to the number of feral hogs on his property. In 2021, Missouri lawmakers passed House Bill No. 369, which redefined feral swine and increased penalties for possessing, transporting and releasing feral swine, per MDC. In order to protect landowners, the bill specifically prevented criminalization of accidental escapes, transportation of domestic hogs, farming or raising domestic hogs. Reed used to allow people to shoot feral hogs on his land, but those methods stopped with the addition of trappers. It used to be that the sounders would spot a truck approaching and they'd take off. ""Now, when they see a truck coming across a field to set a trap to catch them all at one time, they're not wigged out,"" Reed said during the feral hog field day at Johnson's Shut-Ins State Park. Reed said he has mixed feelings on closing the national forests to hunting for feral hogs, but in the past couple of years, he's seen a shift from conservation officials and others to mend relationships between them and landowners. There have been 252 feral hogs killed on Reed's property so far. There are several reasons why feral hogs aren't recommended to be eaten, including that they carry diseases. Feral hog samples tested in Missouri have revealed at least three diseases: swine brucellosis, pseudo-rabies, and classic swine fever. Swine brucellosis: a bacterial disease that is spread among feral swine through close contact. Infected swine carry these bacteria for life, according to the CDC. This disease can cause severe, long-lasting health problems, and even death, if it is not diagnosed and treated quickly. Pseudorabies: a disease of swine that can also affect cattle, dogs, cats, sheep, and goats, according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Pseudorabies virus is a contagious herpesvirus that causes reproductive problems, respiratory problems and occasional deaths in hogs. Classic swine fever: a highly contagious and economically significant viral disease of pigs, per the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The severity of the illness varies with the strain of the virus, the age of the pig, and the immune status of the herd. MDC asks that you report all hog sightings online mdc.mo.gov/feralhog or call 573-522-4115 ext. 3296. MDC-affiliated trappers will help remove hogs from your property.

4/21/2022,"MONROE, Ga. (AP) — Opponents trying to derail a $5 billion, 7,500-job electric truck plant in Georgia dominated a state meeting this week that was meant to gather suggestions on how to design the plant to mitigate any impact on the environment. The state assumed oversight over the Rivian Automotive project after opponents overwhelmed Morgan County planning and zoning officials. The plant was announced by the company and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in December, and is the biggest single industrial project in state history. The first meeting of one of the oversight committees was Monday in the city of Monroe. The Irvine, California-based electric vehicle manufacturer announced last year that it would build the facility on a 2,000-acre (809-hectare) site in Morgan and Walton counties about 45 miles (72 kilometers) east of Atlanta along Interstate 20. It plans to produce up to 400,000 vehicles a year there. Rivian, which also has a plant in Normal, Illinois, said it hopes to break ground as early as this summer and begin production in 2024. The state panel, led by John Eunice, deputy director for the state Environmental Protection Division, did not get much cooperation from a hostile crowd that gathered at Athens Technical College in Monroe, news outlets reported. Opposition to the plant has been heavy from Rutledge-area residents who say the plant will spoil their rural quality of life. Residents criticized the meeting as a sham, saying it's impossible to make meaningful suggestions when there's not yet a plant design and saying the state is only working to get the plant built. “I was sitting at home and I saw my governor get on TV and say Rivian, 2,000-acre plant, coming to Rutledge, Georgia and it’s a done deal,"" said Pam Jones. Many speakers Monday voiced concerns about possible well-water contamination, light pollution, and the disruption of wildlife habitats and farmland for heavy industry. “I don’t understand why you are sitting on that side of the table, which is the Rivian side of the table and why you’re not sitting over here asking Rivian and Gov. Kemp to explain this environmental project and how it’s a disaster,” said Edwin Snell of Oconee County. A Rivian executive was present via video conference but did not speak during the hearing. A spokesperson for Rivian said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for the company to gather input and that the company is committed to sharing details of their plans for the site once they are complete and “meet our own high design and environmental standards.” The plant is a subject of contention in Georgia's Republican primary for governor, with former U.S. Sen. David Perdue attacking Kemp for agreeing to the Rivian location without support from neighbors. Eunice said he does not know when Rivian will file for environmental permits needed to build the facility. He said the division will take public comment on the permits. Monday's meeting was the first of four planned for the site design and environmental committee. The state plans four meetings each with three other committees tasked with examining quality of life, workforce and local business engagement issues.",U.S./Associated Press,Rivian electric car plant blasted by foes at Georgia meeting,https://news.yahoo.com/rivian-electric-car-plant-blasted-143253746.html
