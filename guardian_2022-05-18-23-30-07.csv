5/18/2022,"The chief executive of Shell is facing an investor revolt over his £13.5m pay packet, as oil and gas firms battle growing calls for a windfall tax on their profits. The investment adviser Pirc has urged shareholders to vote against Ben van Beurden’s pay packet at next week’s annual general meeting, calling it “excessive”. The Dutchman picked up £6.3m last year, up from £5.2m a year earlier. The company has given him a 3.5% increase in salary to £1.42m and he has the opportunity to land a further £12.1m in cash and shares by hitting company targets. Pirc said the chief executive’s salary was in the top 25% of a peer comparator group “which raises concerns over the excessiveness of their pay”. It also called for “the fallacy of alignment with shareholders to be retired”. Companies typically argue that large share awards incentivise executives to increase the stock price for investors. Van Beurden, who relocated to London from The Hague this year, has seen the value of his stock in the company balloon from £14m a year ago to £23m now as investors have piled into oil and gas stocks during the energy crisis. Reports of bumper profits and pay at oil companies have sparked calls led by the Labour party for a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators to pay to reduce household energy bills. Boris Johnson has said he believes a one-off levy would deter investment into the UK by energy companies. His Labour counterpart, Keir Starmer, on Wednesday urged the prime minister to “make up his mind” and said a U-turn on the tax was “inevitable”. Van Beurden has raked in more than £70m in pay and bonuses since taking the job in 2014. He suffered a shareholder revolt over his £8m pay packet in 2018. His pay has significantly diminished since the £17.8m he landed before Covid lockdowns hit oil stocks. Van Beurden was docked £132,283 – 10% of his base salary – last year after the firm recorded eight deaths. The fatalities included six workers at an engineering contractor killed when gunmen attacked a bus convoy en route to a gas project in Nigeria. The investor advisory service Glass Lewis said not reducing his payout by more “risks sending a mixed message to the executives as to the company’s overarching safety goal” but still suggested shareholders should vote in favour of Shell’s pay proposals. The company’s long-term plan to reduce its emissions will also be discussed at its annual meeting, which takes place in London on Tuesday. The Shell investor Royal London said it intends to abstain on a vote on the firm’s climate transition proposals. “There is not enough certainty in the plan that it aligns with the goals of the Paris agreement and the global necessary efforts to constraint temperature increases to below 1.5C,” Carlota Garcia-Manas, the head of engagement at Royal London Asset Management, said. The Dutch activist group Follow This wants the company’s policies to be more consistent with the Paris climate accord. Shell’s board has told investors to reject the group’s resolution that asks it to set more stringent climate goals. The Follow This founder, Mark van Baal, said: “We hope investors do not give in to the narrative from oil companies that the crisis created by the war in Ukraine overrides the climate crisis.”",News/Business,Shell boss faces investor rebellion over £13.5m pay package,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/shell-boss-faces-investor-rebellion-over-pay-package
5/18/2022,"Ilearned photography through workshops and forums in Hanoi, Vietnam. This is where I fell in love with documentary-style photography. It had a creative freedom I couldn’t find in other forms. Feeling inspired, in the summer of 2010 I went to a documentary workshop in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Participants had seven days to come up with a project, and five days in I was the only one who didn’t have any pictures. My idea was to do something around culture, and while researching this, I came across a website called thepinkchoice.com, a travel guide for the LGBTQ+ community listing gay-friendly hotels and cities. At the time, I didn’t know much about homosexuality, but I wanted to learn and understand more and I decided to document the people who stayed at these hotels. When I returned to Vietnam, I learned more about the LGBTQ+ community in Hanoi, and thought about how they were portrayed in the media. Although homosexuality is legal and generally accepted in Vietnam today, there were, and still are, negative stereotypes in TV and film. Gay characters are either tragic or comic, nothing in between. In photography, it was no better. Pictures documenting LGBTQ+ stories hid faces or showed only small details of intimacy, such as holding hands. It made me feel like being gay was a taboo, and I felt these representations didn’t empower the LGBTQ+ community. The reality was different. My gay friends lived happily and were open about their sexuality. But wider society was only open to a degree. I found that I got negative reactions to pictures I took of gay couples being intimate, which really motivated me to continue with my project. I wanted to show gay relationships in a natural and beautiful way. By capturing couples in familiar, everyday activities, I hoped to open the eyes of Vietnamese society to the intimacy and love that these couples shared. I met Phan Thi Thuy Vy and Dang Thi Bich Bay, the couple in this picture, through some other people I had photographed for the project. They were university students, full of life and madly in love. Like a lot of the younger couples I met, they weren’t concerned with neighbourhood talk – they were just excited to have their photograph taken. I always spend time with the people I shoot to get to know them a little before taking their picture, and I met Phan and Dang two or three times for coffee before I went to their house, without my camera, to get a feel of their place and how they spent their time. You have two times when you can naturally capture people: the beginning of the day when they don’t care yet, and the end of the day when they’re most tired. On the day of the shoot, I only had the afternoon, as the two were busy with university much of the time and worked weekend mornings in a coffee shop. The girls were play-acting as soon as I got there – cooking, showering and talking with friends on the phone. I knew the frame I wanted, so I had to be patient. I sat behind the TV, somewhat hidden but able to capture them from different angles. Then, as the sunset lit the room, Dang lay down eating lychees, and Phan came and sat with her. Their tiredness had caught up with them, and as they gently comforted each other, my presence was barely felt: I knew I had the shot. This was the last picture I took that day, and the final of the whole series. I find the charismatic simplicity of their home powerful, and their young love and carefree nature, not knowing what the future holds, extremely comforting. Working on the Pink Choice changed me. The couples I photographed gave me strength to not care what other people think. My photos don’t provide all the answers, but I hope that they ignite a curiosity, a feeling that inspires me whenever I start a project – a curiosity to question and learn.

5/18/2022,"Finland and Sweden have submitted their applications for Nato membership triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Seven people share their thoughts on what Nato membership would mean for them, and how they feel about the Russia-Ukraine war. I feel I speak for many Finns when I say we are choosing the lesser of two evils. I have never been a fan of Nato but Putin has left us no option. He trashed the trust and made it clear that Russia is not only callous and cruel, but its regime is also highly unpredictable in its irredentist adventures. Some Finns have always wanted to join Nato. I can understand that, but I think neutrality served us well over the years. Russia just made it impossible to carry on.One problem is that because these seismic shifts have been so fast, we’ve never had the time to properly discuss what our role or place in the alliance would be: should we follow the US interests as closely as possible, like Denmark? Or build closer ties with Estonia and Baltics? Or try to build on a similar peaceful mediator role as before? Mikael Viljanen, 45, teacher, Helsinki, Finland We should have joined Nato as early as the Baltic countries did. In Finland we are used to trusting what has been agreed – even someone’s spoken word is enough. The leaders of Russia have shown now very clearly that they act just the opposite. At the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war I felt deeply desperate and even paralysed. I experienced similar things when I was a child when my father fought against Russians on the frontline as a medic in the war between the Soviet Union and Finland. In Finland there are a lot of people of Russian origin – most of them do not want war. I feel deep sorrow for the ordinary people in Ukraine and Russia who are suffering. Juhani Viherlahti, 80, chief executive and entrepreneur, Espoo, Finland It’s all happened too fast as if there was absolutely no other choice. I feel we’ve missed out the possibility of peace. Joining Nato seems very shortsighted from the point of a view of a humanist and pacifist. I feel our country will be less safe and Helsinki could become an easy target for Putin. Katja, 56, psychotherapist, Helsinki, Finland My preference is for Finland and Sweden to remain independent from Nato, have no US troops or other weapons as they are not needed or wanted. But with the Russia-Ukraine war it was time to apply to join. I don’t think highly of Nato or what it does. If Finland is allowed to become a member I think there should be no Nato base in the country. Finland has to state that it will remain as a defensive country within Nato, as we’re not into war like the UK, US and others. Russia has complained and made threats since Finland became independent. Sometimes we think Russia should shut up, have a sauna, a beer, and relax. Leif Väisänen, 42, property renovator, Oulu, Finland Sweden has been neutral for more than 200 years. I think it’s a mistake to break that neutrality; a Nato membership will not be good for us in the long run. It seems the decision is either out of fear of a Russian invasion, or out of spite because Russia told us not to. Either way, fear or spite is not a good enough reason to make such a major decision this quickly. I would not want to be responsible should one of the other Nato nations do something stupid. It would be scary to have such a close military relationship with a country such as Turkey. Maria, 22, works for a textile company, Gothenburg, Sweden I think that the decision has been taken far too rapidly and without real possibility of democratic influence from other political parties. Firstly, the social democrats do not want the Nato question to be a question under debate in the run-up to the election in September. Secondly, they have been successful during Covid to portray themselves as the party that acts appropriately in times of crisis and they want to continue doing so. Nevertheless, they are abandoning 200 years of neutrality which has served Sweden well. I feel like this is the last part of an ongoing abandonment of the Swedish folkhemmet in which a strong and alliance-free state took care of its citizens. I feel a longing for a society that is now being lost. I also think that there will be a price to pay for Nato protection. Statements by [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan are already signalling what that might be. I think Russia has little interest in Sweden besides if we join Nato – not joining is probably more secure. Karolina Enquist Källgren, 30s, associate professor, Stockholm, Sweden As a Finn residing in Sweden with a Swedish spouse, we are both sad that Nato wasn’t buried simultaneously with the Warsaw pact. They are both products of a bygone era. EU should have developed a strong European military union already back then. Regrettably, it’s too late for that now. Neighbouring countries such as Iceland, Norway and Denmark have participated in a military alliance led by Washington – for what appears to be no visible benefit to any of them. Today’s situation is awful but we have no choice but to take the leap into Nato because some people in the west have allowed the dictatorship in Russia to flourish. Of course, Putin’s guilt is indisputable. Russia must be stopped.

5/18/2022,"Our energy system is crucial to two of the biggest issues facing the British public: the cost of living crisis and the climate and environment emergency. Yet we are leaving this sector to be inefficiently and exploitatively run by private companies. Electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels or by renewable technology such as wind turbines; then it is distributed along the national and regional grids, and finally sold to us by energy suppliers. In the UK, there is no public sector role in this: every part of the process is privatised. Right now, Britain needs to address three things to deal with the crises at hand: we need to transition to generating renewable energy, we need to make sure our national grid is ready for this change, and we need to reduce the prices charged by energy suppliers. The latter issue has become particularly acute since global gas prices spiked due to an uptick in economic activity after pandemic lockdowns ended, and supply restrictions by Russia. Smaller energy suppliers went bust as their wholesale costs exceeded the price cap – the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge households. In April this year, the price cap rules allowed private suppliers to increase bills by an average 54% , and further increases are certain later this year. The government has provided temporary rebates on energy bills and tax relief to customers. The customers of 29 failed energy suppliers have been rescued by transfer to other companies, at the expense of a £2bn surcharge on all energy consumers. Bulb, regarded as too big to fail, is being supported by the Treasury at a cost of £2.2bn. Thus all of the costs of the energy crisis are falling on to the public, either directly through their bills or indirectly through their taxes. None of these costs are borne by the owners of the private companies: quite the opposite. In the last six months, the value of shares in National Grid and Centrica have leapt 20% above the general trend – it’s a good energy crisis for their shareholders. In comparison, in France the system remains dominated by EDF, which is 85% owned by the French state. This has enabled the government to directly control prices by imposing a cap of 4% on EDF’s price rises at a cost of €10bn, which has been financed by halving the company’s profits. The private shareholders of EDF have seen the value of their shares fall 25% below the general trend of share prices. The lack of public sector energy companies also hinders the transition to renewable energy. International evidence shows that “state-owned utilities have a higher tendency to invest in renewables”, because public bodies can insist on the implementation of policy objectives, and that this investment encourages further private investment. In the UK, contracts for offshore wind generation, the biggest single opportunity for renewable generation, and the associated profits and employment opportunities, are all given to commercial companies – which include, paradoxically, large publicly owned European companies Ørsted (of Denmark) and Equinor (Norway). In Germany, where much of the energy sector is in the hands of regional and local government, the city of Munich has stopped trying to persuade reluctant private companies and has instead decided that the municipal utility company would make the investments needed “to produce so much green energy that the entire demand of the city can be met [by 2025]”. The private owners of the transmission and distribution grids provide continuing proof of the 200-year-old economic observation that “natural monopolies” are exploited for excessive gain in private hands, and so should be publicly owned. The National Grid alone extracted £1.4bn in dividends in each of the last two years. They even create further problems for the transition to renewable energy, which offers an opportunity for further extraction of monopoly profits, by making excessive charges for connections to the grid, delaying renewable projects by up to 10 years. A more effective approach would be to enable consumers to sign up to a publicly run energy supplier, by properly nationalising Bulb; to bring the grid into public hands so we can upgrade the system to deal with renewable energy, and stop the extraction of billions in dividends; to create the capacity for more government- and community-owned renewable energy generation; and to open energy policy to public participation by creating regional energy agencies. British people are shouldering the burden of the energy and climate emergencies while private companies profit. The case for public ownership is now being made on a daily basis by the failures of our current system. As we see in Europe, there are much better, public, alternatives.

5/18/2022,"I didn’t love reading at all when I was young. As a teacher, I loved it, and now as a reader, I love it. But I was put off the whole idea of words very early on. Some years ago, I was made to do a key stage 2 (seven to 11 years old) English test. I don’t even want to tell you how I did, but it wasn’t good. I find expressions such as “fronted adverbials” and “subordinate conjunctions” extraordinarily abstract and difficult to get my head around. But we’re stuck in the Michael Gove era, in which children are trained in analysing language in a way that seems to me to restrict and inhibit, rather than to encourage creativity. So I was glad to discover that someone has done some proper research on this part of Gove’s education reforms; UCL and University of York have found that this emphasis on grammar in primary school does not improve six- and seven-year-old children’s writing. When I was a primary school teacher in the 1970s, in a village called Wickhambreaux, just outside Canterbury, we were free of such burdens. I was able to concentrate on encouraging children to find their own voices. That is what literacy is for – to express your thoughts, to discover the music in language, the joy of reading, and all the interest, knowledge and understanding we can gain through that. It is not the analysis of a sentence – that comes later. As you read one story, they pick up a book by the same author or a similar book with a similar subject, and extend their reading on their own. And I extended their writing by saying to them: “Look, Roald Dahl was your age once. He sat down and wrote his first story. Why don’t we go and write our stories?” I would never make them sit down with a blank sheet of paper, and then say: “Do it”, which is what happens time and time again in tests up and down the country to this day. It’s an impossible task to set a child. You have to inspire them; you have to go out and trigger it somehow. We would go for long walks up to the nature reserve, look at herons standing in the reeds, and we would be quiet. Then we would go back and write down what we felt about what we had seen. Some children would be descriptive; most were very thoughtful. But each of them was beginning to find their voice as a writer. They weren’t cramped by anything I was trying to teach them. This is the opposite of how I was taught, at St Matthias primary school in London, which was very punishment-driven. There was fear in the classroom, and grammar and punctuation were part of that. It is now a wonderful school, where kindness and creativity go hand in hand. I came from quite a bookish family. I was read to every night by my mum, who was an actor. She was guided by the instinct that if she loved a poem or a story, she wanted to tell me that story, or read me that poem. So I was handed the love of stories by my mother, but then went off to primary school, where I learned that words were not for storytelling, or music or fun. They were about spelling and punctuation, and if you got things wrong, you were in trouble. I didn’t want to go into detention, but I did spend an awful lot of time there because I found the more red marks I got, the more I was scared. And when you’re scared, you don’t do things very well at all. I knew I was pretty good at telling lies, but I didn’t know I could be a storyteller until much later, when I was a teacher. On World Book Day this year, a pupil asked me: “Do you ever make mistakes?” Of course I make mistakes. When I’m working on my own books, I often slip into a slack way of saying things, which is too oral, if you like. I’m reminded about it fairly firmly by good editors, and that’s fine – it’s a way of improving what’s already there, and refining it. My spelling isn’t that great, either; I’m quite ashamed of that sometimes. My grandson can spell things better than me. But that’s OK. It’s just a side of me that needs improvement. At 78, I’ve got plenty of time left. I tell children to look at the manuscripts of writers far greater than I shall ever be, and the amount of crossings out that they do. Children are concerned about not getting it right, and that is part of the problem. But actually, it’s really good fun telling a story. I’ve been working on a new one this morning. I started the day thinking it was going to be one kind of a story. I started the first three or four sentences, which didn’t seem to go that well, so I crossed them out. That’s what you do – you judder and judder until you find the right tone for the story and a path seems to open up through the undergrowth in front of you, and you find a way to go. But it’s not going to be helped by a constant worry that the sentence you have just written is not correct. I grew up with people telling me: never, never start any sentence with “and”; I start huge numbers of sentences with “and”. I’m not just trying to get back at some English teacher I had when I was 10. While I can see how you could overdo it, sometimes there’s a really good reason for doing it. And sometimes there’s a very good reason for having a comma rather than a full stop. It’s a matter of judgment, and not just rules. I think today’s rules are a misunderstanding of language. Grammar, punctuation and spelling are guidelines about how we frame our language, and very important in terms of communication, for accurately reflecting what it is we wish to say and how to be understood. But they’re not supposed to tie us up in knots. It is important to keep our focus on every child becoming a reader, and having the experience of falling in love with Philip Pullman and Jane Austen and Shakespeare. It is not about teaching something that’s then got to be tested. If you do that, what will happen – and what has always happened in our system – is that those who succeed at that level are fine and go on their way towards university. And those who don’t succeed begin to feel that they’re failures and that language and books aren’t for them, because they’re not enjoyable, because they keep getting bad marks in tests. The problem with testing is that there are winners and losers and we have an education system that divides people very early on. More and more, what has been lacking in our primary schools is space in the curriculum for creativity, for exploring the potential of children in terms of the way they use language. I often get letters from teachers and children correcting the grammar in my books, and they are quite right. But people can be over-obsessed by it. If you look at some of our great writers and you start analysing sentences, the poetry is what counts, the sound, the meaning. The grammar is supposed to be what serves that. It’s not what you start out with in the first place.

5/18/2022,"Paul Verhoeven’s Dirty-Harry-Frankenstein’s-monster goes clanking and wheezing out into the Detroit streets once more, with his humungous exo-skeleton, thigh-mounted handgun case, killer-marionette walk and the balletically defined 45-degree head-swivels that precede a change in direction. This sci-fi action satire from 1987, wittily scripted by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner, is now rereleased in its original director’s cut, with the gruesome violence and its attendant black-comic queasiness restored. But the gore was never, for me, entirely the point. RoboCop looks more than ever like Verhoeven’s masterpiece, a classic of 80s Hollywood and apart from everything else a brilliant commentary on the city of Detroit; hi-tech RoboCop is a harbinger of the decline of the automotive industry and the ruin-porn wasteland to come. And America’s automated “Star Wars” defence system of the Reagan age comes into discussion: in a throwaway aside, the film imagines it accidentally zapping Planet Earth, killing two former presidents as it does so. Murphy (Peter Weller) is a cop in Detroit who is assigned to a new partner: Lewis (Nancy Allen). But Murphy is butchered and left for dead by a drug gang led by ruthless mobster Clarence (Kurtwood Smith), who is laundering his coke profits through a creepy corporation led by chilling CEO Mr Jones (Ronny Cox). Jones happens to be developing “RoboCop” technology for the city’s police department: a cyborg officer which will be cheaper to run and impossible to kill, but which needs a cop’s body. Poor Murphy is chosen as the first bionic officer. And so the terrible beauty of RoboCop is born. When Murphy is in his comatose state, and then operated on by the tech boffins so that he can be reborn in robo-evolutionary form, there are some great point-of-view scenes as the white coated people peer callously down into this face. Then, of course, there are Murphy’s agonised memories of his own near-death, and of his wife and child, which the scientists have not been able to erase. We get some outrageous 80s-style action explosions and people perpetually getting thrown through plate-glass windows (the fake sugar-glass was a novelty that action directors hadn’t yet got used to) but there are also some great touches: the ramp that leads from the station-house out into the street is so steep that the bodywork of every squad car bashes sparks out of the concrete on their way up. The film is full of set pieces which have become classics: perhaps especially the boardroom scene at the very beginning, in which an early, quasi-quadruped version of RoboCop is demonstrated, and a luckless executive has to pretend he’s the surrendering robber who has only to throw down his weapon in front of the armed automaton to be peacefully arrested. The prototype doesn’t work out. There are droll clips from the TV news and ads for toys like the board game Nukem (a genuinely disturbing moment). RoboCop was obviously inspired by that other 80s classic, The Terminator – but The Terminator didn’t have this sophisticated, subversive element. The thrillingly impassive RoboCop still creates a frisson.  Robocop is released on 20 May in cinemas.",Arts/Film,"RoboCop review – thrilling, subversive 80s masterpiece from Paul Verhoeven",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/18/robocop-review-thrilling-subversive-80s-masterpiece-from-paul-verhoeven
5/18/2022,"Ihave never forgiven myself for attending the 1991 FA Cup final. Tottenham Hotspur versus Nottingham Forest. I had broken my leg very badly playing football a year earlier, and a blazer-wearer I knew at the Football Association had kindly sent me a ticket to cheer me up. I am a fan of neither Spurs nor Forest but, having never been to an FA Cup final, I was excited to be there. Well, I was excited until the moment I took my seat, whereupon my feelings turned to something more like guilt or shame. I was sitting between an ardent Forest fan and an ardent Spurs fan. Both were telling me of the lengths to which they had gone to score their tickets – and how many of their fellow fans were missing out. I felt terrible. As a neutral, I had no business being there. Football is no place for neutrals. If my team ever got to a major final, I would be livid to have to share the experience with someone who didn’t care either way about the result. I was deeply uncomfortable about being that someone. Spurs won 2-1; it felt like being at the wedding celebration of strangers or, in Forest’s case, the funeral of someone I didn’t know. On Wednesday night, 43,883 people will watch Glasgow Rangers and Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League final at Seville’s Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán stadium. Only 19,000 of them have been allocated their tickets as supporters of the two teams. The other 24,883 tickets have gone to corporate guests and neutrals associated with various other clubs. Those 24,883 people need to take a long look at themselves. If they’re Rangers or Frankfurt fans who managed to wangle a seat from somewhere, fair enough. But the rest of them won’t be getting into footballing heaven, at least if I’m manning the pearly gates. The neutral fan or, even worse, the corporately entertained, there-for-a-night-out non-fan has been killing football for a good while now. The further your team goes in tournaments and cup competitions, the worse it gets. Working at the 2006 World Cup final in Berlin, I shared a coach from the park-and-ride at the Olympic stadium with a bus full of Samsung executives. They were all in suits, accessorised with lanyards – their golden tickets into suites wherein they would find huge tables groaning under the weight of mountains of fine food and drink. Outside the ground, I bumped into a guy I had met filming on a gas rig in the North Sea a couple of years earlier. The thing was, I remembered him telling me that day he wasn’t into football at all. I asked him what he was doing there. He told me his son’s girlfriend’s dad had been given some tickets; he was high up at McDonald’s, you see. In the stadium, proper fans of France and Italy were jammed into shamefully small areas behind each goal. It all felt terribly wrong. It was just as wrong – worse, actually – when I next went to a World Cup final: France versus Croatia in Moscow in 2018. This time, having Croatian heritage, I had a dog in the fight. I was there as a fan, and a fervent one at that. But next to me I had a sharply dressed middle-aged bloke who had plainly never been to a football match before. His lanyard told me he was Mexican. He celebrated goals for both sides with equal enthusiasm. He did so by standing up and dad-dancing while taking selfies. On the final whistle he celebrated France’s victory in the same way, if a little more vigorously. I glowered darkly, murderously, at him. Honestly, I would have been less offended by a jubilant Frenchman dancing triumphantly in front of me, playing an accordion and blowing Gauloises smoke in my face.

5/18/2022,"The prices of fuel at UK forecourts have hit record highs, as the cost of living crisis intensifies. The average pump price for petrol reached 167.64p a litre, the RAC said, surpassing the previous record of 167.30p set on 22 March. Diesel prices rose to an average of 180.90p a litre at the end of Tuesday, passing the previous peak of 180.29p reached on Monday. The prices of both fuels could be pushed higher by a full EU ban on Russian energy imports. The highs come amid accusations that petrol retailers have been profiteering by not passing on the 5p a litre cut to fuel duty announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in the spring statement in March. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said the cut did “not appear to have been passed through to forecourt prices in any visible or meaningful way”. He urged retailers to rectify this, and said he had asked the Competition and Markets Authority to look into the matter. Consumers are facing a squeeze on household budgets, with the price of food rising and energy bills soaring. Inflation hit 9% in April, the highest level for more than 40 years. The AA has calculated that the cost of filling the typical 55-litre tank has risen during the year from £70.61 to £92.20 for petrol and from £71.94 to £99.48 for diesel. Luke Bosdet, a spokesperson for the motoring group, said: “Despite his best efforts, the chancellor must feel like King Canute having tried to reverse the tide of rising pump prices. At least … he can say that UK drivers would be £2.75 a tank even more worse off now had he not tried to take action in March. “He hasn’t been helped by a fuel trade that, despite a 16p-a-litre fall in petrol costs that coincided with the spring statement, couldn’t even pass on the full 5p fuel duty cut and the 1p VAT reduction that it brought with it.” Simon Williams, a spokesperson for the RAC, said: “While the average price of both petrol and diesel would have been far higher without the historic duty cut, it’s also unfortunately the case that drivers haven’t seen the full benefit at the pumps due to major retailers upping their margins.” Petrol and diesel retailers are facing an increase in logistics and refining costs as a result of a multitude of global factors including the war in Ukraine.

5/18/2022,"The Russian Grand Prix will not be replaced on this year’s calendar after the Formula One race in Sochi was cancelled in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. The F1 season, which had been set to host a record 23 meetings, will now revert to 22 races. F1 had been looking at potential alternative venues to stand in for Russia but concluded that the additional costs and burdens another race would have placed on teams and personnel were not warranted. The race was due to take place on 25 September as the first leg of a triple-header with Singapore and Japan. It is understood that Qatar, which hosted its first GP last year, and a second race in Singapore were in contention to replace the Russian GP but organisers have confirmed the schedule will be shortened. Freight and logistical costs this year are already a major issue in F1, with a potential increase to the budget cap to deal with them under discussion. Adding an additional European race before Singapore was also ruled out because of EU freight rules that would have required teams to return to their factories, unpack and repack to meet regulations after a European meeting. This was considered untenable from a logistical perspective, with two races in Asia and two in the Americas to follow. The Russian GP was scrapped by F1 during testing at Barcelona in February this year, within just over 24 hours of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine starting and under the clear threat of a driver boycott. F1 has terminated its contract with the Sochi race promoter and made it clear it has no intention of racing in Russia in future. The sixth round of the world championship takes place this weekend in Barcelona, which follows races in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Italy and the United States.",Sport/Sport,F1 season cut to 22 races after Russian GP not replaced on calendar,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/18/f1-season-cut-22-races-after-russian-gp-not-replaced
