3/17/2022,"The first attempt to launch Melbourne’s Rising festival – an amalgamation of the Melbourne International Arts Festival and White Night – was cancelled in 2020 due to the first coronavirus wave. The second attempt lasted just one day, when the Victorian government enforced a seven-day lockdown; within five days, it was extended and the festival was shut down entirely. So is the third time the charm? On Thursday, Rising announced its 2022 program, which includes 801 artists – including 685 Australian artists, mostly Victorian – presenting 84 projects, including 14 world and 16 Australian premieres. When Rising was cancelled last year, more than 750 Victorian artists had been ready to present 133 projects – including 36 world premieres. Festival co-directors Hannah Fox and Gideon Obarzanek were “devastated” on their behalf, but there was not enough time to pick up the phone to everyone. “We had a big email list to give everyone the same message at the same time,” Fox says. “Cancelling a festival is as much work as putting one on. We really didn’t have the capacity to have those one-on-one conversations [until] a little while later.” Obarzanek says that for some artists, “this would have been the fifth, eighth, tenth cancellation” during the various restrictions and lockdowns. “We were devastated, but we knew we were on to a good thing,” he says. “We ran three public art pieces that became a beacon along the [Birrarung/Yarra] river – Wandering Stars, The Rivers Sing, and Maree Clark’s work Ancestral Memory on Hamer Hall – that we got permission to run throughout the lockdown, and which became a great place of solace for Melburnians.” Now for their third attempt, Fox and Obarzanek are crossing from pandemic darkness into a new light. Throughout the festival, there will be a new city beacon from sunset until late as artist Robin Fox’s audiovisual installation Birrarung Monochord shoots powerful beams from Immigration Bridge in the west and Birrarung Marr park in the east. “Lasers of this power have never been used in Victoria before,” says Obarzanek. International musicians including Scottish band Arab Strap, British singer Baxter Dury, US singer Lucy Dacus and soul musician Masego will take part in the festival, as will Australia’s rapper Tkay Maidza, punk musician Ed Kuepper and drummer Jim White. Malthouse theatre, whose seasons were severely impacted by lockdowns, has a strong showing at Rising, especially of First Nations works. These include the premiere of The Return, about the pillaging of ancestral remains, a First Nations cast including Jimi Bani, Ghenoa Gela and Guy Simon; and a one-woman show from Elaine Crombie, Janet’s Vagrant Love. At Arts House, dance company Marrugeku will finally bring Jurrungu Ngan-ga (Straight Talk) to Melbourne, in which nine culturally diverse performers explore the idea of Australia as a nation of jailers, with input from Yawuru law man Senator Pat Dodson and Kurdish-Iranian writer Behrouz Boochani. Also at Arts House’s Meat Market venue, Danish choreographer Mette Ingvartsen’s 21 pornographies is a one-woman show exploring power and submission. At the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Emmy-winning Australian film-maker Lynette Wallworth will give a live performance lecture called How To Live (After you Die), which had been programmed last year; the film version premiered at Sundance in January. In both versions, Wallworth recounts her teens and early adulthood as part of a radical Christian cult, referencing “the increasing lobbying power of evangelicalism”, says Obarzanek, “and its influence in current popular politics, specifically in regards to Trump, and probably in regards to [Scott] Morrison as well”. The Golden Square program will return to Chinatown with artist Paul Yore creating Seeing is Believing, a rooftop structure that riffs on shrines, funhouses and megachurches. Taiwanese artist Sui Hui Yu’s The White Waters reinterprets a Ming dynasty folk story through a lens of queer and Taiwanese history. And US artist Jenny Holzer’s text-based projections I Conjure, cancelled last year, will return, beamed on to the Queen Victoria Women’s Centre building. Few of the previously announced shows have been dumped entirely; others, such as This, by David Woods of Ridiculusmus fame, have been pushed back. The challenge for artists creating new shows is that they must now compete with a backlog of postponed events. There are fewer projects planned in 2022 than 2021, largely because some works have since premiered at festivals in cities with fewer restrictions than Melbourne – and others are still regrouping.

3/17/2022,"Plans to cap MPs’ earnings from second jobs have been dropped months after the issue provoked a sleaze scandal that plunged Boris Johnson’s government into crisis, the Guardian can reveal. Ministers told the Commons standards committee that a time limit or ceiling on such earnings would be “impractical”. The prime minister pledged last year to clamp down on MPs’ second jobs after the Owen Paterson lobbying scandal and a furore over Geoffrey Cox being paid nearly £6m as a lawyer since joining parliament, voting by proxy on days he was undertaking paid work. At the time, Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister, said the government would back reasonable limits on MPs’ outside earnings, saying: “You could do it in one of two ways, you could do it by the amount or you could do it by the number of hours. We’ve asked the committee on standards to work up the detail by January.” Another minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, suggested that around 10-15 hours a week would be reasonable. However, the government revealed that it no longer backs such limits in its submission to the current consultation by the Commons standards committee, seen by the Guardian. The conclusion, from Steve Barclay, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and Mark Spencer, the leader of the House of Commons, said: “It is the government’s initial view that the imposition of fixed constraints such as time limits on the amount of time that Members can spend on outside work would be impractical. “The imposition of time limits would not necessarily serve to address recent concerns over paid advocacy and the primary duty of MPs to serve their constituents. It could be possible, for example, for a Member to conduct work within the accepted time limits but that does not necessarily mean such work is ‘appropriate’ even if it did not constitute ‘paid advocacy’.” They add: “In respect of a cap on earnings from outside work to impose such a limit could serve to prohibit activities which do not bring undue influence to bear on the political system. Earnings from activities such as writing books for example, would not preclude Members from meeting their principal duty to their constituents.” During his time as an MP, Johnson registered £88,000 as an advance from the publisher Hodder & Stoughton for a book “as yet unwritten” in 2015. The government said it would support reforms to “restrict the type of outside work which MPs are able to undertake” but did not set out what these should be beyond supporting the current proposal to ban “paid parliamentary advice, consultancy, or strategy services”. It will make its final decision after the consultation is concluded and the committee has produced its final report. In contrast, the Committee for Standards in Public Life put forward a suggestion of an “objective means of setting reasonable limits” on earnings by MPs from second jobs. “We believe the Standards Committee and the House should set an indicative limit of hours and remuneration, with a rebuttable presumption that paid outside employment exceeding those limits would be considered unreasonable,” its chair, Lord Evans, said in his submission. The government also took issue with a number of other suggested changes, including the idea that MPs could be referred to the standards commissioner for behaviour in the Commons. It opposed changes to the MPs’ code of conduct to make it an offence for any member to “subject anyone to unreasonable and excessive personal attack in any medium”. The government said this could have a chilling effect on free speech and unduly stop MPs from expressing their views. Numerous – largely Conservative – MPs also responded to the consultation on their standards regime with a wide range of criticisms. Tory MP Craig Whittaker described some of the proposals on limits and declaring contracts for second jobs as “more nonsense! Bureaucratic, burdensome and just plain ridiculous” and “another ‘barking mad’ idea!”. Philip Dunne, a Tory MP and former minister with a second job that pays him £3,400 a month as a non-executive director, warned that a system to ban paid parliamentary consultancy had “led to the loss of experienced and qualified experts from parliamentary discourse” from the House of Lords. The committee on standards released its proposals for the code of conduct in November. It said MPs should face a complete ban on working as paid consultants and ministers should be more open about any potential conflicts of interest. Other recommendations included an obligation for MPs to have a written contract for any outside work, available for inspection if needed, and which would spell out that they cannot lobby on behalf of the employer. It also raised the possibility of limits on how much time MPs can spend on outside jobs or other interests, and how much they can be paid for them, but said this would need cross-party support.",News/Politics,Plans to cap UK MPs’ earnings from second jobs dropped,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/17/plans-to-cap-uk-mps-earnings-from-second-jobs-dropped
3/17/2022,"Ministers are coming under growing pressure to intervene to soften the impact of the cost of living crisis amid fresh warnings that millions of low-income households risk sliding into further debt, hunger and poverty. More than 50 charities have warned that the consequences of driving through a below-inflation benefit pay rise in April will be “unthinkable” for households already struggling to cover soaring food and energy costs and a rise in national insurance. They urged ministers to scrap plans to uprate all benefits by 3.1% and instead use the spring statement next week to help struggling families by pushing up benefits in line with inflation, which is projected to be running at 7.25% by April. Meanwhile, the former prime minister Gordon Brown warned on Wednesday that anxiety over the cost of living crisis had replaced the pandemic as the biggest source of worry in the public’s minds. “The cost of living crisis has really taken over from the Covid crisis as a real catastrophe for people. What you can see from the polling is that the cost of living crisis is by far the biggest priority for people,” Brown said. The government is understood to be reluctant to commit to extra spending but is said to acknowledge concerns over the critical “starve or freeze” choices faced by low-income families as energy and food bills soar way beyond incomes. A letter signed by charities including the Child Poverty Action Group, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), Citizens Advice and Save the Children UK warned that a 3.1% uprating would amount to the second real-terms cut to universal credit in six months, after the withdrawal in October of the £20-a-week Covid uplift. “A second cut to benefits in six months is unthinkable. The government should increase benefits by at least 7% in April to match inflation, and ensure support for housing costs increases in line with rents. All those struggling, including families affected by the benefit cap, must feel the impact,” the letter said. Nine million low-income families will be £500 a year worse off on average if the planned below-inflation increase in universal credit and other means-tested benefits is introduced as planned in April, according to the JRF. Separately, an open letter signed by seven City mayors and more than 50 local authority leaders warned that the number of people in fuel poverty will rise by 3 million to 7.7 million by April – and could rise to as many as 12 million by October if the chancellor does not take remedial action. Meanwhile, the UK’s largest food bank network, the Trussell Trust, said the cost of food and bills had forced two in every five universal credit claimants into debt, with one in six reporting they had had to rely on a food bank at least once since December. Its survey found that 33% of universal credit claimants surveyed had gone at least one day in the past month either without eating or restricting themselves to a single meal. A third said they had been unable to afford to heat their home for more than four days over the past month. Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “Tory ministerial decisions mean families are now left struggling with rising energy bills so unaffordable, tax rises so punishing and universal credit cuts so severe that hundreds of thousands will be pushed into poverty, facing impossible choices between heating and eating.” The Department for Work and Pensions was approached for comment.",News/Business,UK ministers under pressure to ease impact of cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/uk-ministers-under-pressure-to-ease-impact-of-cost-of-living-crisis
3/17/2022,"After Russian missiles began falling on Ukraine in the early hours of 24 February, much of Europe’s media reported the bloody details of Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked all-out attack. In Hungary, however, the state news agency, the Hungarian Telegraph Office (MTI), took a different line. Instead of using the word “war”, it described a “Russian military operation”, wording close to the Kremlin-mandated phrase special military operation. During the first five days of the war, the influential agency referred to a “Russian military operation” (orosz hadművelet) 431 times, according to Zsuzsanna Wirth, a journalist with the investigative media outlet Direkt36, who has studied how the government controls MTI. Only after criticism, did MTI begin to use the word “war” in its coverage. For years Viktor Orbán’s government has been Vladimir Putin’s staunchest ally in the EU, with Kremlin talking points relayed across Hungarian state media. Now the Hungarian government faces a stark choice between Moscow and the EU, although it appears Budapest is trying to have it both ways. Through a series of leaked memos, Wirth uncovered how the government had long told Hungary’s main news agency what to write, from covering the opposition to the Covid pandemic – and Russia. Sensitive topics were off limits, including the difficulties Russia’s Sputnik vaccine encountered in getting an EU licence, Russia’s loan to fund the expansion of the Paks II nuclear power plant and Putin’s time in quarantine. When Russia invaded Ukraine, that pro-Kremlin stance came under fire. Opposition politicians organised a demonstration outside the headquarters of the MTVA, the umbrella organisation for Hungarian state TV, radio and the news agency. At another anti-war protest, people shouted “Russians out” at the gates of the Russian-backed International Investment Bank, an institution with Soviet roots that opened a headquarters in Budapest in 2019. “There was an outrage in Hungary because of how the public media reacted to this war of Russia and there were also protests, real crowds showed up and there were people protesting against the media,” Wirth said. “I think that must have played a role in this switch [calling the invasion a war]. I think they must be more careful than they used to be before. They could do Russian propaganda on public media quite openly, now it’s a bit more difficult for them.” The message from Orbán was more consistent. The Hungarian prime minister condemned Russia’s “military action” within hours of the invasion, although he declined to criticise Putin personally. Nor did Orbán block EU sanctions, although there was a wobble. Two days before the invasion, Hungary angered other EU member states when it was not ready to sign up to sanctions against Russia. At a meeting of senior diplomats, Hungary’s representative neither supported, nor opposed the sanctions, pleading the need for further talks with Budapest. “To consult with [the] capital is a pretext of face-saving vis-a-vis the EU and ass-saving vis-a-vis Russia,” one diplomat commented acidly at the time. After a half-day delay, Hungary fell into line. Orbán was said to be touched by a dramatic appeal for support from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, at an EU summit. Speaking over video link, Zelenskiy told the leaders it might be the last time they saw him alive. “He [Orbán] is not pretending, he was touched by what is happening. Of course he is not super happy to have to do this, but he is not blocking,” said a senior EU diplomat. Daniel Hegedüs, a policy analyst at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, said many people had expected much more trouble from Orbán. Instead, he said, “we were able to see an unexpected realignment with the EU and Nato over Russia over the past couple of weeks.””. Hungary, however, has declined to support a ban on Russian oil and gas exports, although it is hardly alone. Germany, Bulgaria and other EU member states that depend on Russian fossil fuel flows also oppose an immediate ban on oil and gas exports. Budapest also did not block EU funding for lethal weapons for Ukraine, although it will not finance such equipment itself, nor let arms pass over its territory. It argued that sending weapons to Ukraine would endanger people in Transcarpathia, a region in western Ukraine with a large Hungarian minority. Speaking to tens of thousands of flag-waviing supporters on Tuesday, Orbán said Central Europe was only a “chessboard” for big powers and if Hungary did not stand up for its interests, it could easily fall victim of the crisis. “Russia looks at Russian interests, while Ukraine looks at Ukrainian interests. Neither the United States, nor Brussels would think with Hungarians’ mind and feel with Hungarians’ hearts. We must stand up for our own interests,” Orbán said at an event to mark the start of the 1848 uprising, when calls for Hungarian self-determination were brutally crushed by the Russian Tsar. Hungary’s support for the EU common line was not a surprise to some officials in Brussels. While Budapest has blocked other EU foreign policy decisions, it has never stood in the way of sanctions against Russia. Similarly, talk of Orbán blocking the Brexit process, a move some British commentators believed could help the UK secure a better deal, was never anything more than that: talk. EU officials believe Orbán is treading a fine line, as Hungarian public opinion swings against Russia in the final weeks of the Hungarian election campaign. Although the united opposition is trailing the government in the polls, Orbán is seen as seeking to avoid criticism of his pro-Russia policy before voting on 3 April. His leading rival, Péter Márki-Zay, a conservative supported by six opposition parties, has accused Orbán of being too accommodating towards Russia and China. “We only have one choice: we must choose Europe instead of the east and freedom instead of authoritarianism,” Márki-Zay said at an opposition rally on Tuesday. While Orbán wants to stay on board with the EU and Nato, there is a different message for his domestic audience. The Hungarian state media machine continues to regurgitate Kremlin talking points, while downplaying the brutality of the war. One national security “expert” on state TV compared Zelenskiy to Adolf Hitler; another talking head on Pesti, a private network that receives state funding, said there was no such thing as the Ukrainian people and culture, while the language was just a dialect of Russian. Both examples were collated by the NGO Átlátszó, which also reported how Hungarian state TV described Russian-controlled territories in east Ukraine as “areas between Russia and Ukraine”, a description that chimes with Moscow’s narrative, although not Hungary’s official policy. “Hungarian pro-government media, but also public media is still overly dominated by pro-Russian narratives, and even pro-Russian disinformation is prevalent in the Hungarian media space,” Hegedüs said. “Changing the narrative harshly or making a U-turn could pose some very uncomfortable questions to the governing party in the middle of the election campaign, which they would like to avoid.”",News/World news,Orbán treads fine line as Hungarian opinion swings against Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/orban-treads-fine-line-as-hungarian-opinion-swings-against-russia
3/17/2022,"The federal government’s announcement of funding to help build the Urannah Dam in north Queensland would direct $500m to a company run by people with links to the Liberal National party, and to a project facing serious questions about its economic benefit. Guardian Australia reported in 2020 that an economic analysis, commissioned by local environmental groups, found the Urannah project could return as little as 26c for every dollar invested. A subsequent Guardian investigation found that $12m in federal funding announced since 2018 ultimately flowed to Bowen River Utilities, which is run by prominent Queensland Liberal National party figures and donors. The Australian reported the $500m grant would go to that same company. The sole director of Bowen River Utilities is John Cotter Jr, a former member of the LNP’s governing state executive and a former regional party chair. Under a complicated corporate structure, subsidiary companies of Bowen River Utilities are run by people who include two LNP donors. The suite of companies proposing the Urannah scheme were – until July 2019 – previously mostly owned by Initiative Capital, a venture specialising in public-private partnerships that is owned by Cotter and his wife, Regina. Profiles of Bowen River Utilities staff on LinkedIn previously listed their employer as Initiative Capital. Guardian Australia makes no suggestion Bowen River Utilities or any associated individual has acted improperly, or that the company and its proposal should not be eligible to receive federal grant funding. Cotter was quoted by the Australian – which did not mention his or the company’s LNP connections – as saying the $2.9bn dam would be able to provide water to coalmines in the Bowen Basin, supply water for irrigation and would include a pumped hydro-electric scheme. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, on Thursday said the $483 million investment in the 970 gigalitre dam project would help nearby producers develop 20,000 hectares of irrigated land, and deliver more infrastructure to regional centres such as Mackay and Gladstone. But studies have raised serious questions as to whether the project carries the sort of economic benefit suggested. A preliminary business case for Urannah, submitted to the Queensland government in 2019, claimed the project would return a benefit of $1.70 for every dollar invested. It is understood a final business case has been developed but that it has not been released publicly. A review of the preliminary business case by an economist, Andrew Buckwell of Altus Impact, found the benefits were significantly overstated, based on “flawed assumptions” and did not take into account environmental costs, including additional carbon emissions created by the inundation of 6,099 hectares of forest. The economic assessment was commissioned by the Mackay Conservation Group. In each of five scenarios modelled by Buckwell, the project was measured as having a net social cost to the community. In the worst-case scenario, the total benefit of Urannah was equivalent to about a quarter of the cost. “From an economic perspective, the construction of the Urannah Dam should not be supported,” the report concludes. “It will come at a net social cost to the community. “From a policy perspective, the construction of the Urannah Dam should not be supported. It will not achieve the stated goals of cost recovery from water users.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While much of the public discussion about Urannah has focused on how the project might boost local agriculture, the bulk of any water transported to Moranbah would be used for coalmining. Documents submitted by Bowen River Utilities to the federal government for environmental assessment show it has consulted major coalmine operators in the Bowen Basin about buying water from Urannah. “Community and stakeholder consultation has been targeted and conducted at a regional level as part of the feasibility studies for the project,” the referral document says. “The focus of stakeholder engagement, to date, has been on water infrastructure and potential customers of a large-scale water solution. Consultation with the following stakeholders has been undertaken … Rio Tinto, Glencore, QCoal, New Hope, BMA, Peabody, Anglo American, Stanmore, Fitzroy Resources.” John Cotter Jr has been approached for comment.",News/Australia news,Urannah Dam funding would direct $500m to company run by LNP-linked figures,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/urannah-dam-funding-would-direct-500m-to-company-run-by-lnp-linked-figures
