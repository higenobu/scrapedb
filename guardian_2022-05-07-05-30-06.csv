5/7/2022,"Take a wrong turn on the back roads through central Queensland, about 40km from Banana (population 354), and the road turns to gravel. A few clicks further on, over a couple of cattle grids, there’s a bright yellow United Australia party sign – but not another driver to see it for miles. This particular spot is close to smack bang in the middle of the 133,000 sq km electorate of Flynn. Three years ago, Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party polled about 20% of the primary vote in the seat. This time around, minor party voters in some places appear to be coalescing around Clive Palmer’s big-spending UAP. Outside the area, the narrative around the rightwing minor parties seems clear enough. Hanson, Palmer, Campbell Newman and Bob Katter’s parties are competing for the same subset of voters in Queensland (and likely a single senate seat), with One Nation the most likely to prevail. The recruitment of LNP defector George Christensen – though he’s running in an unwinnable place on the One Nation ticket – was thought to boost Hanson’s own chances of returning to the senate. A preference deal with the Liberal National party (one that has the potential to backfire on the LNP with city voters) has also played into Hanson’s hands. But what One Nation doesn’t seem to have – at least in comparison to the UAP – is much money. A One Nation candidate, speaking on condition of anonymity, says her campaign is self-funded. Corflutes for supporters’ front yards costs her $8 each. Meanwhile Palmer’s UAP has bought every available billboard space, and has signs on dusty dirt roads in the middle of nowhere. In bigger towns and tiny towns, Guardian Australia spoke to more than a dozen disaffected voters. Most say they are leaning towards the UAP. In Biloela, Cass Sorensen and Tamara Francis were about to drive 90 minutes to attend a rally with UAP MP Craig Kelly. “It’s the very first time in my life where I have joined a political party,” Francis says. Both say they like One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts and that Hanson’s party would get their preferences. Neither had seen or heard much from the seat’s One Nation candidate. This seems to underscore a problem for Hanson. A significant number of people who are ideologically close to her party might put their first preference elsewhere in lower house seats. If the UAP manages to cement itself as the rightwing party of choice in electorates that attract significant minor party vote – or in places One Nation candidates are not active – Palmer would then become the logical frontrunner for the last Senate quota. That possibility would be particularly acute in places like Townsville, where One Nation has always had significant support, but where the party’s candidate for Herbert actually lives in Melbourne. There are few things conservative voters in north Queensland would dislike more. While conversations about coal and climate have noticeably changed in regional Australia, some LNP voters told Guardian Australia this week that they are leaning towards the United Australia party because of mixed messaging within the Coalition on net zero. In Gladstone – an industrial, Labor-voting town – some of the campaigning at the Labor Day march this week seemed to acknowledge Palmer and the UAP as a tangible electoral factor. In her speech to about 1000 unionists, the Australian Council of Trade Unions president, Michele O’Neil, singled out Palmer over the failure of Queensland Nickel and payout contracts that gagged workers from criticising the billionaire, in exchange for their outstanding entitlements. Political billboards calling Palmer “a distraction” were driven around the rally. On past history, it’s easy to dismiss the UAP as a non-entity. Palmer spent $80m on the 2019 election, for a return of about 3.4% of the national vote. He later claimed that he decided to “polarise the electorate” with anti-Labor ads rather than win seats in 2019. A former UAP official, Jen Sackley, called the party’s 2019 iteration “a lobby group for the Liberal party in yellow shirts”. The UAP advertised heavily ahead of the Queensland state election in 2020 and won 0.62% of the statewide vote. Those joining up, if they read the party constitution, will find that its branches, committees and state executive have little effect, due to an “interim” arrangement –running to 2026 – giving all power to an executive controlled by Palmer. Prof Graeme Orr, an expert on political funding at the University of Queensland, told the Guardian last year the party was “designed to create the veneer of a genuine party, but also effectively so he and his family can never be voted out of office”. And yet, having spent the best part of the past week on the ground in central Queensland, it’s clear there is at least some real-world momentum this time around to justify the massive typeface on the billboards. That may have little impact on the broader election story. Voters leaning towards the UAP – at least the ones we spoke to – had already parted ways with the major parties. But it would be particularly worrying for Hanson, whose political career would be all but over if she can’t finish ahead of Palmer, Newman and Katter in the four-way contest for the rightwing fringe.",News/Australia news,"How Clive Palmer’s deep pockets are building a yellow, slick road straight through One Nation’s heartland",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/07/how-clive-palmers-deep-pockets-are-building-a-yellow-slick-road-straight-through-one-nations-heartland
5/7/2022,"Property is Australia’s default religion. As of early 2022, the total value of residential real estate was about $9.8trn, two-thirds of total household wealth of $14.7tn. This affluence is increasingly problematic. In Australia housing is no longer simply shelter but an investment and store of savings. Like a magic pudding, home equity (current value less any mortgage) is expected to fund consumption, provide for retirement and be passed on to your progeny. Property’s attractiveness is understandable. It provides secure shelter, converts rent to a form of savings, and rising values have historically protected purchasing power. It creates well-paid, difficult-to-offshore, local construction jobs. Policymakers can influence activity through zoning laws, land releases, home ownership incentives, interest rates and loan availability. It is popular with voters. But the resulting over-investment creates several problems. Household savings become concentrated in a single, illiquid asset. Volatile property prices pose risks, especially as purchases typically involve substantial borrowing. Exceptional price rises reflect the confluence of strong population growth, land shortages around major cities, generous tax regimes, incentives, favourable regulatory treatment of mortgages, ultra-low interest rates and abundant credit. This past performance is no guarantee of future values. Across the economy, it ties up a large amount of capital, which does not generate ongoing income, as business investments would. High house prices limit wage flexibility and contribute to Australia’s uncompetitive cost structures. It impedes labour mobility. Households cannot relocate where they cannot find suitable affordable accommodation or trade their existing houses on acceptable terms. Governments become dependent on real estate revenue. Property taxes account for probably more than 30% of state government revenues. Local municipalities rely almost exclusively on this source of income. At 130% of GDP, Australia’s household debt is among the highest in the world. Household borrowing to disposal income on average exceeds 200%, four times that of the 1980s. The Australian banking system is heavily exposed to property prices, with residential mortgages constituting more than 60% of total loans, one of the highest levels globally and more than double that in the US and UK. Maintaining house prices and ensuring the ability to meet mortgage repayments disproportionately influences interest rate settings at the expense of managing inflation or properly compensating savers. This is because, despite record low interest rates debt servicing takes up approximately 13% of income, above the levels of three decades ago when interest rates were near 20%. Immigration and environmental policies must factor in the impact on housing. Elevated prices risk financial instability. History shows that managing runaway property markets without a severe economic slump or financial crisis is difficult. High house values hide stagnant wages and moribund living standards. Housing unaffordability exaggerates inequality, which perpetuates across generations. High prices mean that many homebuyers will never pay off their mortgages, instead effectively paying a monthly fee in perpetuity – a “housing-as-a-service” model. Even owners who bought their houses in earlier, more fortunate times, may find that their gains are modest. A quadrupling of house prices over 20 years equates to 7% annually, before annual occupation and interest costs. Owners find themselves asset-rich but income poor. Residences do not provide cashflow and instead necessitate expenditure on rates, utilities, insurance and maintenance. Accessing paper wealth for living expenses requires borrowing against housing equity or downsizing to release cash. But selling may net less cash than expected as the replacement accommodation will have increased in price. The exchange requires available creditworthy buyers and willing lenders. If a large proportion of baby boomers try to down-scale simultaneously, house prices will adjust, reducing the money freed up. Transaction costs of 3% to 5%, such as agent fees, stamp duty and conveyancing, also reduce gains. Major political parties have sought to increase access to housing. While welcome, their policies only assist a limited number of individuals. The additional demand further increases prices and competition for properties, negating benefits. They do not deal with the fundamental problems, failing to address home ownership’s function in our society and economy. While integral to the Australian dream, home ownership has created low-quality, unbalanced growth and deceptive prosperity while contributing to the nation’s structural problems and rigidity. Australia’s reliance on property is now deeply entrenched and probably irreversible. As Winston Churchill observed: “We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us.” Meaningful debate is difficult. The two-thirds of Australians who own houses, outright or with a mortgage, will not entertain measures, no matter how well-conceived, that might threaten the value of their principal asset and wealth.

5/7/2022,"Anthony Albanese has left open the possibility of changing his cabinet lineup if he beats Scott Morrison and the Coalition on 21 May, noting the mix of senior personnel will ultimately be a decision for the caucus post-election. In a wide-ranging interview with Guardian Australia on the hustings this week, the Labor leader said all of his colleagues were worthy of their current roles, “but we are certainly not getting ahead of ourselves”. Asked whether the current lineup would remain if he won, Albanese said: “Caucus determines our frontbench. We have democratic processes.” Kevin Rudd altered Labor’s historical practice in 2008 by insisting the leader and not the factions should have the power to appoint his or her frontbench team. Rudd later reflected: “I think that might have been the wrong call because it did add to a sense of powerless on the part of various members of the parliamentary party and, as I’ve reflected on this and discussed it with ministers, a lack a sense of independence on the part of ministers as well.” The power reverted to the caucus in 2013. While the factions now select their candidates for the frontbench, the party leader can and does exercise significant leverage in the event they want a redux of key personnel. If Albanese wins, he will need to balance experience with renewal. Several Labor frontbenchers are veterans of the Rudd and Gillard governments, but the Coalition’s three terms in government have necessitated an influx of newer MPs in the outer shadow ministry and junior assistant shadow minister positions. There has been sustained speculation about whether or not the current shadow defence minister, Brendan O’Connor, will remain in his role post-election. Albanese’s deputy leader, the rightwinger Richard Marles, is said to want the job. Asked specifically about O’Connor’s future during an appearance on the ABC on Thursday night, Albanese said the Victorian leftwinger, who squared off against Peter Dutton in a National Press Club policy debate this week, was “doing a fantastic job”. Albanese said as a “starting point” his view was “those people who have their existing portfolios will continue in those roles”. Two weeks remain until the election. Albanese will face off against Scott Morrison in the second leaders debate of the campaign on Sunday night, with a third debate in the middle of next week. National opinion polls suggest Labor is in front of the Coalition as the campaign enters the home stretch. But with high voter interest in alternatives to the major parties, backroom strategists aren’t sure how the contest will ultimately break. Liberals are pessimistic about the chances of holding some city seats currently under challenge from teal independents, but MPs say Morrison and the Coalition continue to track well in Queensland, where the government enjoys a significant electoral buffer, and in outer suburban areas. Labor holds a notional 69 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives, so Albanese will require a net gain of seven seats to form majority government. But Labor could form a minority government with a gain of five seats. The Liberals hold 75 seats and will need to offset any losses with gains elsewhere. Albanese told Guardian Australia he is not prepared to make Labor’s climate policy more ambitious to secure confidence and supply agreements from any teal independents that ultimately make it to the crossbench, but he can deliver another key item on their wishlist – a federal anti-corruption body. As the campaign enters the final fortnight, neither side is prepared to countenance concessions in the event of a hung parliament. Morrison is also ramping up pressure on Albanese over his performance during the campaign. Ahead of the opening of pre-poll voting on Monday, the Liberals have kicked off a grassroots fundraising drive focusing on Albanese’s missteps on the hustings. In a call to action to supporters, Liberal campaign director Andrew Hirst said on Friday: “In the last three weeks, Mr Albanese has got the unemployment rate wrong, he didn’t know the RBA cash rate, he fibbed about his policies being formally costed, and he flip-flopped on our border protection – not once but twice.” Hirst said ahead of early voting opening on Monday, he needed donations to “help to raise awareness about the risks Mr Albanese poses to Australia and our future”.",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese open to cabinet reshuffle if Labor wins election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/07/anthony-albanese-open-to-cabinet-reshuffle-if-labor-wins-election
5/7/2022,"Until now, the contest between Liberal MP Jason Falinski and former middle distance runner and local GP Dr Sophie Scamps for Sydney’s northern beaches seat of Mackellar has been dismissed as a case study in optimism over hard facts. The Liberals have held Mackellar for an unbroken 73 years. Falinski holds the seat with a whopping 13.3% two-party-preferred margin and in 2019 won 53% of the primary vote. He’s personable, moderate, believes in climate change and knows his electorate. But something seems to be happening in Mackellar that is turning it into a contest to watch. Mackellar borders Warringah, the seat where independent Zali Steggall made history in 2019 by defeating former prime minister Tony Abbott. Most have dismissed Scamps’ chances because the contest lacked that emotional frisson that Abbott, a very public climate change sceptic, generated among moderate Liberal voters concerned about the climate crisis. But Scamps has the current prime minister, Scott Morrison. His attacks on the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption coupled with a perception that the Liberals have taken Mackellar for granted (the flipside of pork-barrelling) have added the zing to her pitch about real climate action. “I think I will probably go independent. She seems pretty capable,” said Peter, who was waiting outside the pharmacy at Dee Why for his flu shot when approached by Guardian Australia. “Plus neither of the majors have impressed me, particularly on climate change – it’s the biggie,” he added. Another voter, Mark, who was outside the coffee shop at Narraweena, said it was the federal integrity commission “and the dishonesty of Scott Morrison” that had swayed him toward voting independent. A UComms poll of 833 voters in the seat in early April by Climate 200 found Scamps had 23.9% of the primary vote, while Falinski’s vote had been pared back to 35.2%. New polling done in the past week, after Scamps’ campaign launch, is said to have showed her gaining ground (seat polling is generally considered less reliable than national polling though, because of the difficulty in getting a representative sample). Over 1,500 people turned out for Scamps’ launch at Avalon last weekend, drawn in part by performances by Aria-winning musicians – Angus and Julia Stone and Lime Cordiale – who are supporting Scamps’ campaign. In contrast, the Liberals have struggled to get more than a couple of hundred to campaign launches. Recognition is essential for any politician but particularly for an independent. As a doctor in the community, Scamps has been capitalising on her role. “Dr Sophie” corflutes in are highly visible around the northern parts of the electorate but have now spread further south. So visible, in fact, that a dirty tricks campaign has begun in the last 24 hours with doctored posters appearing claiming she is running for the Greens. Scamps and her friend Leonie Scarlett set up Voices of Mackellar more than two years ago to encourage greater participation in politics and to give the community a voice. Out of their kitchen table discussions and surveys Scamps said she realised Mackellar wanted better and different representation through an independent and after a hunt, the group decided on Scamps herself. “I would never have imagined that I would end up as a candidate in a federal election,” she said. “I loved my role as a GP. I spent my days advocating for them [my patients] and their needs. But I had this sense of unease because the biggest thing that was going to affect their health in the future would be climate change,” she said. The group has built a massive volunteer movement with over 1,000 people. There is the “A team” – a group of silver-haired men who build A-frame stands for corflutes – and a group of women who are sewing bunting for events out of reused fabrics in the campaign’s sky blue and yellow. Hundreds of the volunteers have completed training for door-knocking and the campaign estimates that they have already visited about 12,000 homes. As we sit at a coffee shop in Terrey Hills, one of her door-knockers, a woman in her 60s, comes up to thank her for running and to introduce herself. “That happens all the time. People are so grateful there is another voice,” said Scamps. The campaign also has money and expertise. Scamps said it had now raised $600,000, which will be matched by Climate 200, the group run by Simon Holmes à Court. This means the campaign has access to polling, digital advertising, brochures and professional campaign skills, including that of Anthony Reed, a former Labor staffer turned campaign professional who advised Steggall in 2019 and Louise Hislop, who set up Voices of Warringah. Falinski has been highly critical of Climate 200’s funding, warning that it will lead to “dark money funds” being set up by the major parties and an Americanisation of the political process here. “The problem with Climate 200 is we don’t know who’s donated what they are spending their money on. They put up a group of names, no addresses, no amounts and they admit that some are anonymous because they fear losing government contracts,” he said. (Climate 200 publishes the names of most donors on its website and like other campaign organisations will be required to publish all donations over $14,500 in its return to the Australian Electoral Commission.) Falinski is running on his record of pushing for more action on climate change within the Liberal party, his local achievements of getting the government to repeal an offshore drilling licence known as PEP-11, and his success in getting $150m for the widening of the Wakehurst Parkway, a major artery through Warringah and Mackellar. But he is also warning about what would happen if independents defeat moderate Liberals: “It would be a more conservative party. You would not have net zero if you didn’t have Tim Wilson, Katie Allen, Dave Sharma, Jason Falinski and Trent Zimmerman – and there are others too. “People say Matt Canavan is a bad person but he’s representing the concerns of the people he represents in northern Queensland. Ours is to represent the interest of people who live in urban centres such this. That competitive tension within a political party leads to the best outcomes over time.” Taking the temperature in Mackellar is not simple. It is a seat in three parts. The northern part is millionaires territory, with Porsches and Range Rovers more common on Barrenjoey Road than just about any other part of Sydney. In the hinterland of Duffys Forest and Terrey Hills there is more wealth on acreages. There are also middle-class families, mainly of Anglo-Celtic background, who moved there 20 to 30 years ago for the lifestyle, but now find themselves living in houses worth millions. One senior Liberal told the Guardian they would not be surprised to lose to Scamps every one of the booths north of “the bends” that lead up to Avalon. But as Falinski explains, other parts of the seat are different. The western areas include Davidson, Cromer and Narraweena, which are a mix of older people, successful tradies and young families. Many have large mortgages, and the cost of living and the economy looms large. In Dee Why, in the southern end of the seat, there is a younger crowd again: young families who live in the new apartment blocks in the area, professional migrants and young people who rent or have bought their first home. When the Guardian visited this week, it was clear that many people in the southern end of the seat were only just tuning in to the election. In Dee Why, Fiona, who was out walking with her baby, Jasmine, said she had not yet made up her mind. “I’m looking at candidates who are family orientated. I care about schools, rectifying teacher shortages, community and family support. I am also interested in environmental issues, the beaches, fuel prices and interest rates going up,” she said.",News/Australia news,Mackellar malaise: could an independent GP cause an upset in Liberals’ beachside bastion?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/07/mackellar-malaise-could-an-independent-gp-cause-an-upset-in-liberals-beachside-bastion
5/7/2022,"Even their fiercest critics would likely concede that John Barilaro and Barnaby Joyce have been vocal and energetic advocates for regional Australia. As the former deputy premier of New South Wales, Barilaro wore his ability to secure funds for regional parts of the state as a badge of honour, even when done in ways that have exposed him to criticism. Under his leadership the government established a department for regional NSW, and splashed hundreds of millions of dollars around the state in grant funding. And he was never shy about butting up against his Liberal colleagues if he thought it was in the best interests of regional NSW. Barilaro ​​threatened to tear up the Coalition agreement and move his party to the crossbench over a policy to protect koala habitat. He made similar threats over a candidate dispute ahead of the Wagga Wagga byelection in 2018, and over planned regional job cuts at Essential Energy. In Canberra, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, managed to extract something to the tune of $34bn in funding for road and rail projects, water infrastructure, and the vaguely titled “regional accelerator program” in this year’s budget in exchange for the Nationals’ less-than-enthusiastic support for the Coalition’s net zero emissions reduction commitment. In terms of both media coverage and political leverage, it’s been a period of high power for the party of the bush, especially in NSW. Meanwhile, however, their constituents have been suffering horrendous health outcomes, laid bare by the findings of an inquiry into regional health in NSW announced this week. Following 15 months of public hearings and hundreds of submissions, the inquiry’s findings were stark. People who live outside the state’s three main metropolitan areas – Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong – face “significantly poorer health outcomes, greater incidence of chronic disease and greater premature deaths” as a result of chronic underfunding, critical staff shortages and “significant financial challenges” to accessing diagnosis and treatment. The report will be of no surprise to those who have followed the inquiry’s progress, or read the work of Sydney Morning Herald investigative journalist Carrie Fellner. Public hearings have revealed cases in which cooks cared for patients at Condobolin hospital because of a lack of staff. Lack of resources meant patients were increasingly being flown to larger regional hospitals in places such as Dubbo, placing additional strain on an already stretched system. What’s galling is that so many of the stories heard by the inquiry seemed to mirror the findings of the 2008 inquiry by Peter Garling SC. That inquiry led to the establishment of 15 local health districts which were meant to tailor services for the communities they served. But key findings from the latest inquiry relate to the operation of those districts. There is a “lack of communication and genuine consultation” between local health boards and the communities they serve, the inquiry found, and a “culture of fear” within NSW Health in relation to speaking out about patient safety. At its core the inquiry found both a need for a substantial increase in funding for regional health and systematic reform of the way both state and federal governments attract and keep doctors and nurses in rural areas. After much criticism, the Coalition has committed some $900m to capital works in regional health this financial year. The government has also funded millions of dollars in hospital redevelopments in places such as Wagga Wagga, Tumut and Albury in recent years. But the extent of the problems revealed by the inquiry into regional health show mere capital expenditure is not sufficient. The inquiry has recommended a review of current funding models for all of the state’s rural and regional local health districts, as well as ministerial engagement with the federal government to address confusion over governance arrangements and doctor workforce shortages. The Nationals have proved they can use their influence to generate headlines and pressure the Coalition to invest in regional areas, particularly around easy “announceables” such as new infrastructure. Whether they can extend that to force the government to make the sorts of complex changes this report recommends shapes as a key test for the party going into next year’s state election. One imagines it will certainly be a focus of the party’s growing rival, the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party.",News/Australia news,Damning report on NSW regional health a test of Nationals’ power of persuasion,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/07/damning-report-on-nsw-regional-health-a-test-of-nationals-power-of-persuasion
5/7/2022,"Exorbitant rent increases, no-grounds evictions only weeks after moving in, fungi and mould infestations, and scores of denied applications. Renters have shared their horror stories of the crisis in Australia’s housing market. Guardian Australia received more than 110 responses to our series on the national rental crisis. They painted a picture of devastating failures of basic maintenance from broken stairs to rotting cupboards and rental homes without usable cooking appliances. Many renters described feeling disrespected by their landlords, the real estate agents paid to manage the property, and a society that allows the living conditions of so many people to be so precarious. Rent hikes on existing leases was by far the most common complaint, with renters reporting increases from an extra $45 per week on a two-bedroom townhouse to an additional $240 per week on a house. “Two days ago I received an email from the real estate agent notifying me that my rent would be increased from $450pw to $550pw,” a 27-year-old student in inner-city Sydney wrote. A 48-year-old aged care worker and mother of three wrote: “We previously lived in Box Hill, Sydney, and were given an eviction notice due to the owners wanting our rent of $540 per week to [be raised to] $700 per week due to market rents sky-rocketing.” Renters in coastal regions of New South Wales and Queensland, in particular, described struggling against a combination of hiked-up rental prices thanks to an influx of residents, a rush to sell that has seen owners issuing no-grounds eviction notices in order to capitalise on inflated house prices, and large-scale displacement due to natural disasters. Rental bidding is rife, with many renters looking for a home reporting they were told that offering over the advertised price was the only way to secure even substandard properties. A 44-year-old Sydney resident described inspecting the house he and his family eventually rented out of desperation, by offering $150 per week over the advertised weekly rent. “On our first walk through, the house was a disgusting mess and it smelt of damp so bad we had to cover our noses, but we were assured of a deep clean,” he wrote. “We found out quite quickly that the smell was due to a rising damp problem as well as leaky roofs, which we could live with by opening windows and constant cleaning. But with the recent rains there is mould all over the ceiling which keeps coming back. We’ve had so many leaks I can’t count and the carpets are black around the edges in some rooms.” Maintenance issues were common, including urgent repairs going unaddressed, resulting in houses that were only partially habitable. A woman in her 20s wrote about her rental in Melbourne’s west: “There was a water leakage issue in the shower which caused the tiles underneath to be inundated with water, causing mushrooms to grow in the bathroom crevices (on multiple occasions).” For those with a disability or access needs, these issues were compounded. A 46-year-old woman who is also the carer for her autistic son wrote she had recently been diagnosed with cancer. “When our lease came up for renewal we explained our situation and asked for two more years to give stability. The landlord came back with a $60 a week increase even though the agent agreed with us that it was significantly over market value.” They eventually agreed on a $30 per week increase with a year-long lease, but that it would rise again by $30 the following year. She felt taking it to the tribunal was impossible. A 39-year-old woman from Sydney, who was disabled after a car accident that left her with nerve damage, said her current home was “an overpriced one-bedroom granny flat” that she had lived in since her previous rental was sold, only two weeks after she had moved in. “This place is not suitable for my needs,” she wrote. “There’s a steep gravel walkway (I have mobility challenges) and the bathroom is so small that the door doesn’t open wide enough to get a shower stool in there. There’s an issue with landlords conducting repairs in a timely manner. I was without a cooking method for over a year, the front door can’t be locked from the exterior and the showerhead broke a week after moving in and still hasn’t been repaired.” She had been looking for a new house, she said, but there were almost no affordable options. Even the unaffordable ones were not feasible. “Suitability is still an issue and these properties are still miles away from my healthcare providers. There are images of these properties showing their need of repairs, kitchen cabinet doors falling off the hinges, lack of silicone around sinks and bathtubs, damage to the exterior of the oven, some are clearly filthy,” she wrote. “The other issue is the number of agents now asking for months of rent upfront. For people like me, whose rent is more than 75% of my income, how am I supposed to save up to provide months of rent upfront?” Many older renters expressed concern about their future. Some said they were currently homeless – and in some cases, they had been so for years, living out in the elements or out of camper vans or cars – as they had been unable to find a new home before losing their previous one. “As someone on the cusp of the fastest-growing demographic of homelessness, I’m terrified of what the future holds,” a 49-year-old woman wrote. It’s not just Australia’s most vulnerable who are feeling the screws tighten: renters with secure jobs and support networks who wrote to Guardian Australia said they have been startled by the sudden precariousness of their situation – and expressed concern for those less fortunate. “We’re in our 30s and 40s, in secure salaried positions with positive rental histories and I’ve never felt this vulnerable as a tenant before,” wrote a music teacher from Melbourne. A 48-year-old writer said her family had spent months searching for a new house for their family of four. “As a family with two full-time incomes, we thought we would be at some advantage, but found that this is no longer the case at all. Houses in Melbourne’s inner suburbs are now priced at around $300 [per week] per bedroom, minimum. This is hugely expensive for anyone – but for parents who have to cover the entire rent on their own (around $1200 for a four-bedroom house), this is a significant weekly outlay – easily putting us in the rent/mortgage stress category. I have no idea how single parents are coping!” Single parents say things are impossible. A 42-year-old single mother with four children described how she had spent time in emergency accommodation, the criteria of which was to apply for at least 10 rental properties per week. “When I turned up to most inspections there were single couples with no children applying for four-bedroom homes, as there’s also a shortage of smaller properties,” she wrote. “Some of these rental properties were putrid. I wouldn’t let a dog live in [them]. One place had the kitchen and bath taps hanging off, a bathtub with spilled black paint in it … ​​Another place had missing kitchen cupboards and drawers. And these were rentals asking $400 a week and upwards.” In another house, she said, the tenant was still there while the house was open for inspection, as they were sick in bed with Covid-19. After months of knock-backs, the woman was told by real estate agents that if she could offer up to six months’ rent in advance, and show she had at least $30,000 in savings, she would be a more desirable tenant. “I would have my own house if I had that sort of money,” she said.",News/Australia news,‘I’ve never felt this vulnerable’: Guardian readers share their rental crisis horror stories,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/07/ive-never-felt-this-vulnerable-guardian-readers-share-their-rental-crisis-horror-stories
5/7/2022,"Two medical professionals who were responsible for conducting Veronica Nelson’s medical assessment on her first night in prison have presented contradictory evidence at an inquest into her death. The 37-year-old Yorta Yorta, Gunditjmara, Dja Dja Wurrung and Wiradjuri woman died at Dame Phyllis Frost Centre on 2 January, 2020, less than 48 hours after her arrival at the Melbourne women’s prison. At the coroners court in Melbourne this week, an inquest into her death has heard that while the nurse who undertook her initial medical assessment was “concerned” and suggested Nelson be sent to hospital, the doctor who conducted the same assessment said she looked “well” — and called the nurse a liar. Stephanie Hills, a registered nurse, gave evidence at the inquest on Monday and Wednesday. She told Sharon Lacy, the counsel assisting the coroner Simon McGregor, that she was “concerned” at Nelson’s appearance. She said Nelson was at times incoherent and appeared unwell, sitting “draped” in the chair. She was “too unwell or incoherent to be weighed,” Hill said. Hill said she had to “physically support Veronica upright in the chair in order to apply the blood pressure cuff,” and that Nelson’s blood pressure and heart rate readings were low. She said she suggested to the doctor leading the intake assessment, Dr Sean Runacres, that Nelson be taken to hospital. Hill told Lacy that she first raised the issue after taking Nelson’s blood pressure. “Once I got the blood pressure and heart rate reading, that taken into consideration with how I had to support her to obtain that with her physical presentation of slumping over the chair, all of that combined, I expressed my concern and stated: ‘Do you think we need to send her to hospital?’” She said Runacres responded by saying something along the lines of “I’m the doctor. I will make the decisions.” “I believe there was a, ‘you’re just a nurse’ thrown in there as well,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Hill questioned information input into the prison’s health records from that assessment, which included Nelson’s weight, when she was not weighed, and information about her teeth, which she says were not examined or discussed in the intake assessment. It also included information about her chest and heart, but Hill said Nelson’s chest and heart were not examined. She said Runacres remained sitting throughout the examination, leaving her to take the observations as required. “I undertook everything but none of that [listening to airways] was done,” she said. Hill said she was not able to challenge Runacres, because he was senior to her. “I can’t demand that a doctor perform an abdominal assessment or listen to a heart rhythm or listen to lung capacity,” she told the inquest. “I can’t demand that of a doctor. I’m a nurse.” Dr Sean Runacres gave evidence on Thursday. He told the court he had no recollection of assessing or meeting Nelson and was relying on his notes to give evidence. He also said he could not recall when told of her death, and later told the court he made it a point not to recall patients, for his own mental health. “Prior to training as a medical practitioner, I was a paramedic,” Runacres said. “I’ve seen more dead people than I care to remember … I make it a conscientious effort not to remember so I can sleep. I choose not to remember my patients.” Asked to respond to Hill’s claim that he did not get out of his chair during Nelson’s intake assessment, Runacres said: “I think nurse Hills is a liar.” He added: “I found nurse Hills to be excitable, easily alarmed, I don’t place a lot of value on her clinical judgment.” Hills earlier told the inquest they had worked together on maybe 60 to 7o occasions. Runacres’ notes from the assessment stated that he found Nelson to be “generally well” and “not toxic looking”. He repeated that assessment after being shown CCTV footage of Nelson’s arrival at the medical unit, saying in the inquest: “an extremely unwell person wouldn’t walk down a corridor with their hands on their hips”. “I’ve seen a lot of sick people in my time as a paramedic and a doctor,” he said. “If they’re able to present like that down a corridor … heart rate in normal range. I’d call that well.” Christine Fenech, a prison officer who was working in the medical unit on the night that Nelson arrived, told the inquest on Monday that she did not have medical qualifications but was “concerned” about how Nelson looked. “I’ve never seen anyone as thin and frail as Veronica looked,” Fenech told Stella Gold, counsel for Nelson’s mother, Aunty Donna Nelson. Gold asked if Nelson needed urgent medical attention. “I’m not qualified to say that but, yes,” Fenech said. Nelson was found dead in her cell about 7.50am on 2 January, after making repeated calls on the intercom complaining of severe cramps. She had vomited repeatedly since being taken to prison and complained of dehydration. Her cause of death at autopsy was found to be complications of Wilke’s syndrome in a setting of acute opiate withdrawal. Both Hill and Runacres were granted legal immunity for evidence given at the inquest, a common practice in coronial courts. The inquest continues next week.",News/Australia news,Veronica Nelson inquest: nurse and doctor give contradictory evidence on prison medical assessment,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/07/veronica-nelson-inquest-nurse-and-doctor-give-contradictory-evidence-on-prison-medical-assessment
5/7/2022,"With just two weeks left in the federal election campaign, the Coalition and Labor have promised billions of dollars in local funding projects as they battle for key marginal electorates. But some neighbouring safe seats have so far received no funding promises at all. An analysis of data from Guardian Australia’s pork-o-meter lays bare the seats being targeted by the major parties, with commitments to pour billions into one side of the electoral fence while neglecting the other. By 2 May, about halfway through the election campaign, $8.4bn had been promised for local projects, with $7bn coming from the Coalition and $1.4bn from Labor. Analysing the election promises by location, it is clear some seats have missed out entirely. Western Sydney is considered a key election battleground, but the contrast in promises for the seats of Werriwa versus Lindsay shows there are particular pockets of the west that the Coalition and Labor are focused on. The Liberal party seized Lindsay from Labor at the 2019 election, holding it by a margin of 5%. Desperate for first-time MP Melissa McIntosh to retain the seat, the Coalition have so far promised about $247m in funding for local projects within Lindsay, including $232.5m towards upgrading Mulgoa Road, $12m to upgrade a commuter car park at Kingswood Station, $2m for a new assistance dog training facility in Orchard Hills, and $590,000 towards upgrading Bennett Park. Meanwhile, Labor has so far vowed to spend $8.5m in Lindsay if it wins government, which it will spend upgrading Cook Park. On its south-eastern flank, on the other side of Elizabeth Drive, is Werriwa, held by Labor’s Anne Stanley. While she holds the seats by a relatively slim margin of 5.5%, Werriwa has never left Labor hands and is not considered to be in play this election. The Coalition has not announced any projects or funding in Werriwa, while Labor have announced a Headspace centre for Edmonson Park without pledging a specific amount. In Melbourne’s north the electorate of Scullin has always been in Labor hands, and its current MP, Andrew Giles, the opposition cities and urban infrastructure spokesman, holds the seat by a massive 21.7% margin. Scullin has received no funding promises from either political party. The story couldn’t be more different once you cross Craigieburn Road – the northern boundary of Scullin – into the marginal seat of McEwen. Before Labor’s Rob Mitchell won the seat in 2007, retaining it with a 5.3% margin in 2019, McEwen had been a Liberal seat for 10 years. The Coalition has so far splashed $15.3m in its attempt to snatch the seat, promising $15m for a Macedon Ranges Regional Sports precinct and $345,000 for local youth support services. Labor has already announced $150m to be spent on the Camerons Lane interchange in McEwen, as well as $15,000 on celebrating cultural events for the local Nepalese community if it wins government. The Coalition has also listed the Camerons Lane interchange as part of its proposed Melbourne intermodal terminal infrastructure upgrades to support inland rail, with $280m set aside in the budget for the interchange and road upgrades leading to the proposed freight terminal. In Adelaide’s outer northern suburbs, Labor has held the seat of Spence since 2007, and it’s considered a very safe seat given the 14.1% margin it enjoyed at the last election. Spence has received no funding promises from either party. While Spence is Labor heartland, its eastern border hits the genteel Adelaide Hills and the electorate of Mayo, a formerly blue-ribbon Liberal seat that is now held by crossbench MP Rebekha Sharkie of Centre Alliance by a margin of 5.1%. At the 2019 election the Liberal candidate received the most first-preference votes, but Sharkie was elected on preferences. While Mayo stretches as far as Kangaroo Island, booth-by-booth results at the 2019 election show Sharkie is popular in parts of the Adelaide Hills – an area the Coalition party appears to be targeting, announcing a $120m roads package named the Adelaide Hills Productivity and Road Safety Package. A key question this election is can the Morrison government hold on to its seats, but Gilmore, on the New South Wales south coast, is shaping up as one of the few seats the Liberals could win off Labor. Fiona Phillips, who holds the seat on a 2.6% margin, is being challenged by the Liberal candidate Andrew Constance, the former NSW transport minister and popular local voice following the Black Summer bushfires that devastated the region in 2019. The spendathon in Gilmore is well under way, with more than $500m so far promised for projects in the electorate from both parties. The Coalition’s commitment far outweighs Labor’s, having promised $352m towards the Milton Ulladulla bypass, $40m to improve local road safety, and $32m for planning of the Nowra bypass. Labor has announced $81m for eight smaller projects spread across the electorate, including $25m for an emergency operations precinct in Moruya, $22m for a birthing on country centre of excellence, $7m for a new library district at Sanctuary Point, $6.5m to improve mobile black spots in Gilmore, $5m for planning on the Nowra bypass, and $345,000 for outdoor shade and rain protection areas at two different high schools. Labor has also said it will match the Coalition’s $40m commitment to improve local roads. The funding focus on roads in Gilmore appears to come to an abrupt end once the Prince Highway runs north past the Minnamurra River in Kiama Downs, and into the electorate of Whitlam. Whitlam, held by Labor’s opposition assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, on a 10.9% margin, has never left the party’s hands. Whitlam received no funding announcement for the first few weeks of the campaign, and besides a recent Labor promise for a regional art gallery at a cost of $459,000, neither major party has unveiled a substantial project for the electorate. The funding disparity between the neighbouring Melbourne seats of Hotham and Chisholm goes some way to illustrating the Coalition’s planned path to electoral victory on 21 May. Labor’s Clare O’Neil holds Hotham on a margin of 11.2% (redistributions have made it even safer seat than the 5.9% winning margin at the last election). Hotham – which has been held by Labor since 1980 – has received no funding promises by either party so far this election. In the ultra-marginal seat of Chisholm, just north of Hotham, political parties have been spruiking candidates with local funding announcements since mid-March. Held by Liberal MP Gladys Liu by a razor-thin 0.5% margin, the Coalition have so far announced $13.7m, comprising: $7.5m to redevelop Box Hill City Oval (which is actually in Menzies, but on the border of the Chisholm electorate), $3m to upgrade Mirrabooka Reserve, $1.25m to upgrade the Blackburn Cycling clubhouse and $315,000 to upgrade ground lighting at Caloola Reserve. Outside of local sports funding, the Coalition has also promised $700,000 for a Sikh volunteer community kitchen in Chisholm, $570,000 for a migrant information centre and $360,000 for a local breast cancer survivor group, Knitted Knockers. Labor’s commitment of $22.7m so far dwarfs the Coalition’s, with $13.6m promised to redevelop Box Hill City Oval (almost double what the Liberal party will spend on the project), $3.6m for a new Headspace centre (which Liu has said the Coalition will match but hasn’t costed), $5m for new pavilions and female change rooms at Mount Waverley and Mirrabooka reserves, and $500,000 for a station safety precinct. Retiring Liberal MP Nicole Flint held the Adelaide seat of Boothby by 1.4%, and Labor sees this election as an opportunity to seize the seat from the Liberals for the first time. Independent candidate Jo Dyer is also running in Boothby. So far, Labor has made $12.3m in funding promises for Boothby, including $6m to upgrade facilities at the South Adelaide Basketball Club, $3m to modernise the Marino Community Hall, $1.935m to upgrade two natural reserves, $1m for a hockey club and $544,000 to redevelop a tennis club. The Coalition has announced $6m for Boothby, which also includes a $6m pledge for South Adelaide Basketball Club, $40,000 towards a veterans support centre. Funding to upgrade Collins Class submarines is also set to benefit Boothby. Meanwhile, in neighbouring Hindmarsh, considered to be safely held by Labor’s health spokesman Mark Butler by 6.5%, neither party has announced any funding promises.",News/Australia news,A tale of two electorates: the marginal seats basking in election funding promises while neighbours ignored,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2022/may/07/a-tale-of-two-electorates-the-marginal-seats-basking-in-election-funding-promises-while-neighbours-ignored

5/7/2022,"It’s an overcast Sunday afternoon at Ron Barassi Snr Reserve, a small community ground tucked away in Melbourne’s Docklands. On its lone pitch, two teams of women are approaching the 20th minute of their Victorian Women’s State League Four West clash. Both have had their chances, but the score remains goalless. Aside from the larger than average crowd and a handful of cameras scattered around the touchline, it’s a scene largely archetypal of community football. The only seats to be found are the portable plastic variety; laid out as rudimentary benches for the two sets of substitutes. A few hours earlier, coaches had been putting up the nets, driving the corner flags into the turf and cleaning up dog refuse that had been left on the pitch by apathetic dog walkers. It’s all very mundane, a typical autumn Sunday in Melbourne. Yet for the Afghan women’s national team that is in action for the first time at their new Australian home ground, resplendent in new red kits, there is beauty in the benign. “[Returning to play was] a moment of pride for me, I am proud of my teammates; that they have managed to stand on their feet,” says Fatima*, who captains the side. “I back myself as well to be able to stand on my feet again after all that we went through.” These players’ lives have come under threat simply due to a desire to play football. That they could simply jump on a bus and play a game that wouldn’t draw a second glance from an uninformed passerby is a novel experience for them. Routine for others, the chance to play football with friends or to dance to music blaring out from a portable speaker before heading to the dressing room is cause for celebration. This team has been held up as an inspiration and a symbol around the world. They are a group who’s mere existence constitutes resistance. Fleeing their homeland in the face of the Taliban’s takeover last August, every game they play in exile is a reminder of the agency they refuse to surrender, a spirit that won’t be broken, and a reminder to the world to not forget the women that now exist under the Taliban’s rule. They want to pressure Fifa to uphold gender equality standards and restore their international status. But what cannot be forgotten is that within all these moments of global significance are wrapped smaller, individual achievements; deeply personal milestones that come from living life the way they choose – be it attending school, going to work, or playing football in State League 4. “The moment I was at the Kabul Airport and saw all the incidents and tragedies I could not dream and imagine for this day and be able to return to the football field,” says Fatima, who has been emotional in past interviews recalling her evacuation from Afghanistan. “But, the moment I got on the plane, I got the courage and confidence that I have overcome so much, saw such a grim state of my country and got the determination to strive and earn back all that I have lost. I will never forget those experiences, but now I want to bring pride and privilege to my country together with my teammates, who were crying and sad back then.” When Nilab* broke through 18 minutes into last weekend’s game and coolly slotted into the bottom corner, there was only pure, unadulterated joy. The team had played their first competitive fixture since arriving in Australia the week prior, but that game ended 0-0. This was the first time they had been able to celebrate a goal since arriving in what, at least for now, is home. Sprinting away in celebration, Nilab slid on her knees before kissing the turf and pointing to the sky. Adeba* arrived with a pack of teammates that surrounded and embraced her in a moment of joy. It was a scene that was simultaneously for the entire world to celebrate and one just for members of the national team in exile. “The entire team – I could see everyone since I was the goalkeeper – I saw everyone extremely excited, supporting each other on the field and from the fence,” says Fatima. “I can’t explain and paint a picture of my emotions at that moment – only if someone could have seen all that. “The joy the girls experienced after such a long time, being away from the motherland and family. It was the best day, the best thing that happened to the girls in such a long long time.” One of a number of figures who had sprung into action to help evacuate the team from Afghanistan was Craig Foster, and the former Socceroos captain and human rights campaigner was on hand to witness the goal. “You can see the sheer delight to again be scoring goals,” he said as he watched on. “For them to just be taking the park is already a triumph. But then to see the goals they’re scoring, the great job Jeff [Hopkins, Melbourne Victory’s championship-winning A-League Women’s coach who is leading the team] has done with them and just to see them with their smiles and enjoying themselves so much is very powerful.” Sunday quickly became a day of firsts; the team poured in nine more unanswered goals as they recorded their first win in Australia. They thought it could have been more. “When the girls later spoke with me, to each other with joy and laughter – it was priceless,” Fatima says. “For me, my team is like a second family, I was so happy to see everyone content, happy and smiling.” * Names withheld to ensure player safety ",Sport/Football,‘The best day’: Afghan women’s football team find back of the net and rediscover joy,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/07/the-best-day-afghan-womens-football-team-find-back-of-the-net-and-rediscover-joy
5/7/2022,"As three new Omicron subvariants – BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 – begin to spread in Australia, health authorities are warning of winter surges in both Covid and the flu. Reported Covid infection rates in Australia are already among the highest in the world. As of data from 2 May, Australia’s average daily infection rate is 1,515 cases per million people – the second-highest in the world for countries with a population greater than 1 million, after New Zealand (1,566 cases per million). On Wednesday, Western Australia recorded its highest-ever daily Covid figures with 9,782 cases. Despite its dominance in people’s lives and daily press coverage over the past two years, Australia’s response to the Covid pandemic has not featured prominently during the election campaign. Why are reported infection rates in Australia so high compared with other countries – and despite sustained transmission of the virus, why do many now feel apathetic about Covid? Prof Catherine Bennett, the chair in epidemiology at Deakin University, said Australia’s high reported infection rate may be the result of high “case ascertainment”. Although PCR testing rates have dropped off in Australia, “we’re probably still doing it more so than anywhere else in the world”, Bennett said. “We still have free PCR testing. A lot of countries don’t.” The number of confirmed Covid cases shouldn’t be relied on in isolation, Bennett said. “If you compare us to, say, the UK, they look much better for infection rates,” she said. “The UK’s confirmed case rate is 128 cases per million – less than a tenth of Australia’s 1,515 figure. “Yet their hospitalisation rate per million is 209, and ours is 124. It suggests that they probably have twice as many [true] cases [as Australia].” Prof Adrian Esterman, the chair of biostatistics at the University of South Australia, said the actual case numbers in Australia are still many times the number of reported cases. “If we look at our PCR test positivity rates, they’re still very high,” he said. “In the whole of Australia … 20% of all PCR tests are coming out positive. It tells us that there is an awful lot of Covid that isn’t being diagnosed and we do require more testing – the World Health Organization wants that percentage to be less than 5%.” Esterman believes the sustained high transmission is due to the removal of public health measures across the country. “It’s a ‘let it rip’ policy,” he said. “We’re getting more and more people reinfected.” Three new subvariants of Omicron – BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 – have been detected in Australia for the first time. “All three subvariants are about 25% more transmissible than BA.2,” Esterman said. Figures from South Africa and the US – where reported Covid cases have risen in the last month – suggest that the rates of hospitalisation from the new subvariants are roughly the same as for BA.2, Esterman said. The new subvariants “will almost certainly take over”, he said. Covid numbers have plateaued at high levels around the country, and may subsequently rise again as the new subvariants take hold, Bennett said. “There is the real risk of reinfection with these new variants.” Peter Lewis, the executive director of the research company Essential, said there seems to be “a broad desire for people to move on from Covid even as numbers rise”. Essential polling from August last year showed that only 15% of Australians would find it acceptable to live with more than 1,000 Covid deaths annually as lockdown restrictions were removed. In 2022 to date, there have already been more than 5,000 Covid deaths. “What we said we couldn’t contemplate we’re now shrugging our shoulders about,” Lewis said. Aliza Werner-Seidler, an associate professor at the University of New South Wales and the Black Dog Institute, said Covid fatigue had been a major factor. “Over the last few years, there was a very genuine and appropriate fear and focus on Covid because of the potentially catastrophic outcomes.” Now that the vast majority of the population is vaccinated, and many have also had Covid, “some people are checking out of the conversation”, Werner-Seidler said. “The message that we’re getting in the day to day from our lack of regulation around this now … is that things are back to normal. People are booking cruises, people are planning weddings … if you don’t have a high-risk profile, it’s quite hard to resist this sense that this is something that we’re just going to live with now.” In the shift to living with Covid, Werner-Seidler believes there needs to be more conversations about the impacts of the virus for high-risk groups, such as those who are immunocompromised. “It’s really important not to undermine the validity of these people’s concerns,” she said. “The responsibility has been placed back on to the individual and in some ways I think it’s rather unfair.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Werner-Seidler, a clinical psychologist, emphasises that social isolation is a risk factor for many mental health problems, and encourages at-risk people, if they are comfortable, to make plans for interacting with family and friends in Covid-safe manner. “The general public has, by and large, said: no more of this, fed up, not interested,” Esterman said. “The trouble is we’re still getting hundreds and hundreds of deaths and each one of those is a grieving family.” Bennett said it was important to reduce the number of cases and deaths. “Every time we learn something more about long Covid it’s a reminder that if you can avoid infection, do.” But she believes Covid policies should encourage people to minimise individual and collective risk by wearing a mask or social distancing, without forcing requirements upon them. “Public health messaging shouldn’t be about fear – either fear of the virus or fear of fines. In an emergency you might revert to that … [but] rules are not the way we manage infectious diseases normally.”",News/World news,Explainer: why are Covid infection rates in Australia so high compared with other countries?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/explainer-why-are-covid-infection-rates-in-australia-so-high-compared-to-other-countries
5/7/2022,"Jordan Gogos is doing the most. The 27-year-old multi-hyphenate is bouncing across a cluttered room in Powerhouse Museum’s Ultimo workshop. From overflowing boxes of offcut denim to hat sculptures in the shape of birds (made from retrieved ocean fishnets), he shows off everything with equal enthusiasm. “What do you do before you go to a club?” he says. “You smack together! You cut your T-shirt up before you go out, you make this thing, say, ‘That’s kind of cool.’ I guess what we’re doing: we’re smacking things together.” When we talk, he is two weeks away from his second Australian fashion week show under the label Iordanes Spyridon Gogos, which will take place on 12 May. His first fashion week outing in 2021 was one of the season’s most talked-about collections, a mixture of paper-mâché, technicolour corsets and witch’s hats, all made from recycled and repurposed materials. Gogos’s background is in industrial design, but the show was made with a large team of collaborators. Some garments, made in lockdown-induced free time, took as long as 10 weeks to construct. It was an act of pure spectacle – none of the clothing on show was for sale. That big experiment paid off though. Last December, Gogos was given a workshop space at Sydney’s Powerhouse Museum as part of a partnership to deliver the museum’s first runway show, the beginnings of a $500m redevelopment plan to transform the Ultimo space into a design hub. “I have had so many editors being like, ‘Nobody wears your stuff, and you’re getting all this attention,” Gogos says. “‘And you’re still taken as a proper brand in Australia. What is happening?’” This year, Gogos has enlisted 56 collaborators, ranging from established international labels to collectives such as Yarrabah Arts and Cultural Precinct in tropical north Queensland, and emerging talents such as Julia Baldini, a local cobbler who is creating 27 pairs of handmade felted shoes. This time, there’ll be some commerce in the mix: a collaboration with veteran Australian designer Jenny Kee featuring more conventional “wearables” including jeans, jackets and silk shirts. The public will be able to purchase these clothes, but the construction will still include recycled materials, including some remnants from Kee’s 2019 Powerhouse Museum exhibition with Linda Jackson. Gogos is just one of a set of queer emerging Australian designers showing this fashion week. Melbourne designer Erik Yvon and Sydney’s Alix Higgins will both stage their first standalone runway shows at the event. They also credit the pandemic with their current sense of momentum. Higgins, who collaborated with Gogos in 2021, created his label during lockdown (“I was bored and wanted attention and got it,” he jokes). Yvon has had his label since 2017, but noticed an uptick in interest since 2021’s long lockdowns. “We were all dragging,” he says. “It was really grim. My design, it’s all bright and bold and colourful … After Covid, I feel like people are a lot more receptive.” While Yvon and Higgins’s labels are more traditional (ie commercial) than Gogos’s, their designs carry the same sense of exuberance and gaudiness, a queer sensibility that goes beyond genderless design (though all three do that too). Where Gogos brings a club kid mentality to his creative ethos, Yvon and Higgins have already found a home in the queer nightlife scenes of Sydney and Melbourne. It is rare to attend an event such as Sydney’s House of Mince, Loose Ends and Athletica or clubs like Melbourne’s Miscellania or Rainbow House without spotting their creations. Inspired by his Mauritian heritage, Yvon’s beaded handbags, crochet jumpers and mesh-camo dresses exude “main character” energy. When describing the ideal place to wear his clothing, he imagines Rihanna lounging on a boat in the Caribbean. Rather than a “traditional catwalk”, he’s promising a “celebration”, working with Sydney ballroom figure Jack Huang to provide “an extra bit of character”. “I just want to make [the audience] feel happy, because that’s what the label is about,” he says. But Yvon recognises there’s more at play than a need for happiness in terms of larger trends, noting that amid the bubbly, Y2K references there’s a harder, more “apocalyptic” mood. “Everyone’s embracing the destroyed look,” Yvon muses. “We were confined – so all the [design] students used their own resources, what was around them.” A glance through the racks at Sydney shop Distal Phalanx and Melbourne’s Error 404, boutiques known for stocking bleeding-edge emerging designers, illustrates Yvon’s point. From Yvon’s beaded handbags to fellow Melbourne label Maroske Peech’s tie-dye blouses and Wackie Ju’s G-strings with a flower at the back, the look is not so much a coherent trend as a DIY demand for attention. “There’s that term, post-lockdown hedonism,” says Error 404’s Anjelica Angwin. “There’s a real resurgence in club culture, fashion and design here in Melbourne because we can finally access it. I think that comes from a yearning to express the fact that we’re still alive and kicking ... And in the club scene, in particular, there are a lot of people embracing their bodies. It’s really beautiful to see.” Higgins’s work literally and figuratively embraces the body with skin-tight nylon shirts and shorts. His designs feature bold text printed over bright, barcode stripes, making them easy to spot on a dancefloor. With lines of poetry and phrases taken from Higgins’s diaries – such as “fairy type” or “baby i’m so scared” – it looks like a nihilist meme account made flesh. It’s emotionally indulgent, which is why Higgins was surprised to learn his customers mostly feel sexy in his clothes. “I think I’ve made myself that crazy girlfriend nobody wants – cause I’ve just rambled shitty poetry not only on the internet, but all over a wardrobe. It’s cringe, but it’s freeing.” Higgins describes his upcoming collection as “even more unhinged”, due in part to the fact he created the 30-look collection predominantly alone in his studio apartment. “I consider my work quite romantic and poetic, introspective, like an armour,” he says.

Albanese says people have criticised him for a lack of ambition in the Labor program, but when he took the party leadership he wanted a set of measures that could be plausibly implemented in one term. He said he’s always had two dates in his head – 2022 and 2025. “In the first term of a Labor government, if we’ve done childcare reform and made it cheaper, if we’ve fixed the NBN, if we are reorienting infrastructure investments toward productivity, if we are making a difference in terms of security at work, if we are establishing a change to close the gender pay gap, if we’ve advancing the constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament, if we’ve [moved on] climate, establishing the policy for 43% by 2030, and updating transmission into the 21st century, allowing renewables to fit into the grid, creating more energy security, lowering energy prices … that’s an ambitious, big agenda for a new Labor government.” He says if all that can be implemented in three years, that will be a firm foundation for Labor to seek a second term, and the longer the government lasts, the harder it becomes to repeal or erase various reforms. Start with telling the truth, Albanese says. “You deal with that by being honest and straight about it. We haven’t said we will do anything we can’t do. We will always want to do more on health and education but we also have to be economically responsible. We have been very disciplined [fiscally]. We’ve assessed spending against what it delivers for productivity.” The short answer is no. “We are at 43%. Our policy that we are going to the election on is very clear and it’s ambitious, it’s achievable, it’s costed, it’s detailed, and it will make an enormous difference.” What if that’s not enough? “Our policies are clear, and coherent and achievable and they’ll end the climate wars, they are supported by the business community, the National Farmers’ [Federation] and the unions … they can support that, or not. That’s a decision for them. We didn’t come up with a number and work out how to get there. We are the only party that has a plan to get to net zero.” Will there be any detailed minority government agreements? “No,” Albanese says. “What I will do regardless of circumstances is always treat people with respect.” He said the crossbenchers supported Julia Gillard and not Tony Abbott in 2010 because Labor had been courteous and inclusive in the previous parliament. “We engage with people. Morrison has contempt for other views. Part of his objections to a voice to parliament is the only voice he wants to hear is his own. He doesn’t allow private members bills to come forward, he doesn’t treat the parliament with any respect at all. He actually ridicules the concept of parliament. He sees my knowledge of the parliament as a subject of abuse. But that’s how laws are made in this country.” Albanese says the Australia-China relationship “will continue to be difficult”. Is there any opportunity for a reset? “I support the Biden administration’s perspective which is competition without catastrophe. We need more considered responses to China’s more aggressive positioning in the region than just ramping up rhetoric. We need to consider the failure of our foreign policy – the Solomons [security pact with China] was a serious failure. We have been the security partner of choice in the Pacific. We need to not compromise on our values at all. We need to build with our allies … in a coherent way to get a stronger presence in the region. Not just in the Pacific, but the Indian Ocean and countries to our north.” He says Australia needs more enhanced defence capability. “National security is about defence hardware but it’s also about our diplomatic capability in the foreign service, it’s about aid and outreach, and our actions in international forums and working with our neighbours.” He says opportunity lies in Australia jointly hosting a conference of the parties climate conference with the Pacific. He adds it will be important to mend fences with the French president Emmanuel Macron. “What’s important about the French is this isn’t just their position in Europe, they are our near neighbours [in the Pacific]. The breakdown in relationships is more than just France. The decision to leak a text message from the leader of France to the leader of Australia, with spin that distorted that exchange is reprehensible. It’s done extraordinary damage and other leaders will be conscious that happened. I can’t recall a similar event happening between two friendly nations that have been allies and fought in two world wars next to each other.” Albanese says the question of who would lead the Coalition after potential loss is ultimately up to the Liberal party. He says it’s pointless to speculate because at this point, we aren’t sure whether or not Josh Frydenberg will see off what looks to be a serious challenge from a teal independent, or if Peter Dutton holds his Queensland seat. But if Albanese wins, he wants a partner to recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution. Albanese notes Scott Morrison has “walked away” from the recognition agenda. “On issues like constitutional recognition, we will have a very clear and explicit mandate to take it forward. This is unfinished business for the country. It should not be partisan. It needs to get done. It diminishes us as a nation to pretend that our history began in 1788. It neither began then, nor ended then.” Albanese says the voice to parliament is a “generous offer” from Indigenous people and it needs to be met by the major parties in the same generosity of spirit, and soon.",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese: five key questions for the Labor leader ahead of the 2022 election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/07/anthony-albanese-five-key-questions-for-the-labor-leader-ahead-of-the-2022-election
5/7/2022,"Images of queues of idle ambulances outside hospitals are everywhere. They are published and shared on social media, broadcast in news coverage and featured in political campaign advertisements. They are visceral, able to trigger thoughts about what could happen if a person or loved one was stuck outside a hospital, on a stretcher, when emergency care is needed. Ramping is now providing ammunition to opposition parties – in multiple states – that have struggled to cut through to the public throughout the Covid pandemic. South Australia’s new Labor premier, Peter Malinauskas, won a landslide victory in the state’s March election after running a campaign on health and ramping. In Queensland – where ramping times are the worst in the country – the Liberal National party is pledging to improve triaging when ambulances arrive at hospitals and collect real-time data on the system if it wins power. Dr Rob Manwaring, a public policy and politics expert at Flinders University, says ramping is an emotive issue that resonates with voters. It also allows political parties to leverage the power of ambulance unions. “It can be quite effective,” Manwaring tells Guardian Australia. “Because in any given weekend, it’d be easy for the media to find a case of somebody who’s waited a very long time to receive medical attention within a certain time limit and there have been quite extreme cases. “It’s harder to visually represent, for example, delays in-kind of cancer treatments.” While the politicisation of the issue has brought it into the public consciousness, it can also downplay the structural problems that cause ramping and the subsequent policy problems. In simple terms, “ramping” is the delays experienced by ambulances at hospitals which ties up crews, meaning there are fewer ambulances available to respond to other emergencies. It can see paramedics doing the work of emergency departments due to staff shortages. Queensland ambulance service figures for December show the proportion of ambulance trips that resulted in waits of more than 30 minutes before hospital admission reached 46% in the heavily populated south-east region of the state. Data for the quarter ending in December 2021 showed 38% of Queensland ambulances waited over 30 minutes to hand patients over to emergency staff. It was a similar situation in Western Australia, where 37.3% of crews waited 30 minutes, and in Victoria, where 33.9% of ambulances waited over 40 minutes for access to hospital beds. In New South Wales, 16.8% of ambulances wait over 30 minutes due to ramping delays. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While problematic on its own, ramping is symptomatic of deeper issues in the health system. As the chief executive of the Australasian College of Paramedicine, John Bruning, puts it, it is the “end result of a health system in distress.” Ambulance ramping predates Covid – but the pandemic has placed unprecedented demand on healthcare systems. The Australian College of Emergency Medicine’s president, Dr Clare Skinner, says a recent literature review she conducted revealed the first reference to “ramping” in Australian medical journals appeared in 1998. “Covid has only uncovered the cracks that were already existing in the system, and have been for many years,” she says. Skinner says that at the heart of ramping is “access block” at emergency departments. This is when people have been admitted to emergency, but then cannot be transferred to another ward because of a lack of beds there. This means new patients are forced to wait inside ambulances or hospital corridors. She says hospital bed shortages are not always due to physical capacity, and stresses the need to ensure there are adequate nursing stuff and appropriately trained specialists. Other contributing factors include a lack of nursing care in aged care facilities, deferred care that has build up through Covid, nursing & GP shortages, burnt-out healthcare staff leaving the system and Covid furloughing rules depleting staffing workforces. Skinner also points to Australia’s state-federal divide of the health system, resulting in a lack of coordination between different sectors and the structure and financing of primary care. Bruning says quick-fix approaches – increasing the number of paramedics, or creating more hospital beds – are not a silver bullet. The population is growing and ageing, so “that new ward will just fill up unless you deal with the issues of how you transition patients back into their community”. He believes the issue must be fixed by looking holistically at how patients flow in and out of the health system, and at preventive care via GPs or other services.

The secretary of the Victorian Ambulance Union, Danny Hill, is most excited about that program – more than any other part of the budget’s $12bn in funding to repair the state’s battered health system – given the large volume of recently discharged hospital patients that paramedics deal with. Hill uses the example of someone who has had back surgery. “They go home, they’re experiencing pain, but it’s pointless to call triple zero and go back into an emergency department when someone can come out and actually provide the sort of treatment they might need,” he said. Next on Hill’s wishlist is an expansion of the state’s secondary triage system – a separate call system staffed by nurses and paramedics for emergency systems to reduce the burden on the system. In NSW, many health workers, like the rest of the public sector in the state, have wage increases capped at 2.5% – a Covid budgetary measure the union is seeking to scrap. “We are losing staff at an incredible rate to other states and jurisdictions purely because the conditions and the pay in Queensland, Victoria and South Australia are better,” says the Australia Paramedics Association’s NSW delegate, Brett Simpson. “It’s an economic argument because NSW is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars training these staff for the benefit of other states.” The union has also called for an extra 1,500 paramedics to ease some of the pressures on the system. Skinner says a structural reform of primary care in Australia – primarily through the Medicare rebate system to incentivise GPs and reduce shortages – is key. She says Medicare rebates have failed to keep up with the increased cost of living. “A far [greater] problem is the people who haven’t been able to see a GP regularly with what might have been an easily managed problem. They then have a problem that becomes harder to manage and require hospital care,” she says.",News/Australia news,‘Health system in distress’: how ambulance ramping became a major problem,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/07/health-system-in-distress-how-ambulance-ramping-became-a-major-problem
5/7/2022,"We are waiting for Anthony Albanese in a suburban backyard on the New South Wales Central Coast. There’s a Hills hoist, but no trees. At first the bright autumn sun is welcome – a reprieve from the stale air of hotels, planes and buses. But as the sun tracks higher in the sky, the heat becomes oppressive. Tender pale skin stings, and the men in TV-ready suits sweat. The cameramen debate the relative merits of various football songs to lighten the mood. The Labor leader finally emerges from the house to spruik his shared equity housing scheme. In his dark suit, he’s a bit pale, still depleted from the bout of Covid that took him off the hustings for a week. It’s clear he’ll be sweltering within minutes, and he’s not carrying any water. A lack of hydration isn’t the only irritation waiting for him under the Hills hoist. The travelling media are positioned there too. The dynamic on Albanese’s campaign media bus is combative. There are productive stretches, but anyone watching can see a chunk of the combat is performative. In the era of 24/7 media, press conferences are broadcast live, and the cameras point both at the candidate and the camera-ready inquisitors chasing their TV moments. That fishbowl incentivises clickable, shareable jousts. Policy gets short shrift, and dignity, detachment, sobriety and nuance can feel like antiquities from another age. Aggression during campaigns comes with the territory; it thrives like a hothouse plant. The current level of aggro is analogous to the dynamic in 2019, but a lot of the questions are observably dumber. Albanese has always been a broad-brushstrokes politician rather than a wonk or a detail obsessive. Campaign hunting packs always develop a sixth sense about a candidate’s weakness. Sensing potential for “Albanese moments” from a lack of preparation or sharp recall, the 2022 contest has been running like pub trivia without the beers. What’s the cash rate? What are the six points of your NDIS plan? What does a head of lettuce cost? Scott Morrison is more practised at smothering these narcissistic heaves in a press pack he largely holds in contempt. He sets his jaw and asserts his top dog status, barrelling on relentlessly and blanking interlocutors he regards as trouble. Albanese doesn’t shun or subdue, but in the olden times, pre-glow-up, he bristled at media questions he considered trivial or absurd. This is one of the habits the Labor leader has excised in his quest to assume the aerodynamic form of a putative prime minister. He’s clearly unimpressed with the posturing, but by and large, he lets aggressive inanity pop and crackle around him. In the backyard, we are only a couple of questions in when it becomes clear that Albanese needs water. He signals to one of his advancers. A glass is procured from inside the house and ferried down to him. Albanese is standing up with frontbencher Jason Clare, who swerves between housing policy facts and cheesy bon mots while watching for cues about Albanese’s physical wellbeing out of the corner of one eye. Albanese and Clare are with the candidate for Robertson, Gordon Reid, who is an emergency physician. Albanese chugs a mouthful of water and relays the glass back to Reid, who cups it carefully behind his back. In a couple of hours from now, the Reserve Bank will increase the official cash rate for the first time since 2010. That development will render anything that’s transpired in the morning entirely redundant. It is clear Albanese’s head is already in what Philip Lowe will do in a couple of hours. This is typical. Albanese might not have much talent for hustings vaudeville, but strategically, he’s two steps ahead. Perhaps this is a survival skill you learn coming of age in the Labor left in NSW, back when the right faction were the untrammelled masters of the political universe. Albanese rose in Labor politics as a resourceful inner-city activist. He didn’t roll off the production line of the union movement. He’s always had to scrap – find his own numbers, build a power base, construct the network that sustains him personally and professionally. He’s loyal to his people, because he knows nothing can be taken for granted. Nothing was gifted. Everything is earned. But I suspect Albanese’s front-running impulse was formed much earlier. He spent chunks of time alone as a kid because his mum battled crippling rheumatoid arthritis. He had to learn to be resilient and self-reliant, and trust his own instincts and judgments. Kids who want for nothing can live in the moment, but kids who deal with adversity learn to play three-dimensional chess. Life teaches them to anticipate what’s coming, because if you do that, you can control your environment. Mostly, these qualities serve Albanese’s interests. But sometimes they wall him off. They prevent him from focusing or listening when people are trying to help. In any case, Albanese is spruiking his new housing affordability policy in this backyard in Gosford because he’s personally invested in it. This policy speaks to the circumstances of his own life, and it unfurls his conviction that government is a tide that lifts all boats. But the campaign vignette is a placeholder – a curtain raiser to the Reserve Bank. So if a Sky News journalist wants to get personal, chipping at him about why he hasn’t sold his investment property to increase Australia’s housing stock – go ahead. Do your worst. Albanese sips his water and conserves energy while the daily hustings ordinance screams and explodes overhead, showering him in embers. A sharp-eyed political friend of mine in the first week of the campaign characterised the contest as a tussle between a bloke who doesn’t deserve it (Morrison) and one who isn’t up to it (Albanese). This pithy framing goes to the heart of Albanese’s challenge. To win, he has to convince the voters tired of Morrison that he represents safe change. Albanese was a late convert to his own manifest destiny. Leading, craving the Lodge, wasn’t his original plan. Albanese’s preferred candidate for that position was Greg Combet. But Combet burned out and destroyed his health implementing a carbon price, and he suffocated in the toxicity of the Rudd-Gillard civil war. When his Combet plan flamed out Albanese faced a choice: step up when the moment presented, or remain forever counsellor and kingmaker. The moment presented. He stepped up, and Albanese wants to win. He wants it enough to drink and eat sparingly, to try to listen more, lose his temper less, to ask for what he needs and sometimes imagine he doesn’t know it all. Having gone into the contest believing he was completely match fit and would enjoy six weeks of conversations, answering every journalist’s question, he crashed inelegantly into the asymmetric warfare of a national campaign, in the process remembering why Labor has only won a handful of federal elections since the second world war. He was sufficiently humbled by his opening day hustings stumble to ask for more targeted support. The contest in 2022 is very hard for strategists to read. There is significant voter disenchantment. The mood is very different in different parts of the country. Polls suggest major party support is bleeding to populist micro-parties and integrity independents, and no one is sure how that protest vote ultimately distributes. The national polls have Labor in front. Labor is tracking better than it was at the same point in 2019, but not as strongly as 2007. But national poll metrics are useless. Ten byelections in different parts of the country will decide the 21 May result, and Albanese’s date with destiny is now all very real. There’s a cop at the front gate on the rare nights he gets home, and another in the front seat of the car when I’m bundled into the back to have a conversation for this piece. Everybody is rallying. His partner, Jodie, makes sure he has Panadol, Hydralyte and a bite of lunch. As the election clock counts down, the praetorian guard is out in force – Jim Chalmers, Penny Wong, Kristina Keneally, Katy Gallagher, Mark Butler, Tony Burke. Two of the “roosters” who made and broke Labor leaders back in the day are also supplying counsel in the background – Stephen Smith and Wayne Swan. Kevin Rudd and Paul Keating came to the campaign launch and they are on the phone. He has an able national secretary and campaign director in Paul Erickson. Just before the campaign, Albanese scheduled an extended session with Bill Kelty in Melbourne. Kelty, the mercurial, intense, at once visionary and pugnacious labour movement veteran, coached him to look for common interest, for “structural ways of bringing people together”. Kelty talked to him about how Labor governments achieved economic reform. Albanese and Bill Shorten are not close, but he says he’s spoken to his predecessor about campaigns. He’s in contact with old mates, including a friend from primary school who is now a wharfie in Perth – with business leaders and union officials he trusts. He’s exchanged messages in the course of this week with Mike Cannon-Brookes, a sometime tennis partner who has launched a raid on AGL, and with Alan Joyce, the Qantas boss. Albanese is assuming nothing, but planning for everything. Morrison paints his opponent as a hapless parliamentary tragic with no grasp of the practicalities of running a government or an economy. This is ridiculous, given Albanese sat at the heart of two governments and steered an agenda through the 43rd parliament when Labor lacked a majority in both houses. He understands governing is an institutional game, and he understands just how fast a transition from opposition to government goes – and how events can blow your agenda off course. He’s reflected deeply on what went wrong in the Rudd-Gillard period. He’s proud of those two parliaments, and the Labor achievements, from the NDIS to paid parental leave. But he says one of the reasons the wheels came off was the government trying to do too much too quickly, and sometimes without proper deliberation and process. When he took the party leadership, he distilled his objectives: “What is a Labor program of achievable reforms in our first term that make a difference to people’s lives?” He needed to triage and prioritise. “We are very consciously clear about what we are doing. I have in mind the 2025 campaign, not just 2022.” Albanese knows if he wins on 21 May, he’ll be in Japan within days, meeting Joe Biden, Fumio Kishida and Narendra Modi. His team are mapping a potential transition that will include a restructure of the public service and personnel changes “to reflect where our priorities are”. Shadow ministers are already reaching out to senior public servants, and the elite of Canberra’s bureaucracy during the caretaker period thinks about how to implement an alternative program. As we speed towards Sydney this week, Albanese tells me that when parliament resumes, any new government will need the “structures in place to drive the change, the creation of Jobs and Skills Australia, the creation of the National Reconstruction Fund” and to make sure bodies like Infrastructure Australia have serious boards. Past experience tells him “the structural things need to be put in place early”. “One of the first things I’ll do is get the premiers and chief ministers around the table, not to make decisions, but to open up genuine dialogue,” Albanese says. “I need to convene a full employment summit with employer organisations, unions and civil society. How we get productivity will be a big focus, how do we get more secure work.” He wants to revive a process the Morrison government started with business and unions during the pandemic to find common ground with industrial relations reform. He says small businesses need a seat at that table. He notes there was productive dialogue under the Coalition’s process “and then nothing happened”. He says positive change “doesn’t have to start from zero because there are productive relationships there”. So Albanese’s got a mud map of his first 100 days, a strong support crew and a personal network he’s spent a lifetime accumulating. But winning or losing – that is on him. Albanese has two weeks to circumvent or crash through the sideshow of the hustings and persuade voters he’s the man for the times. Psychologically, emotionally, practically, this campaign puts Albanese back in the house of his childhood, a place where people love you unconditionally but they can’t always help you. It’s all on him. Albanese is looking out of the car window as we close in on Sydney’s inner west. “We are back in Albo country,” he says. His sense of place – this distinctive urban topography, the diverse community, the grasslands where he gets out of his head and walks the anxious dog he’s besotted with, this neighbourhood where his mother lived and died, where he grew to adulthood, where his son grew up, where his marriage ended, where his new relationship began – is one of the great anchors of his life. It has shaped him as a person and a politician. “Albo country” is sacred land. Albanese learned his political skills in this neighbourhood before he hit his teens – how to organise, how to connect with people, build a network – how to value what you have, and get what you need. In a dehumanised profession, Albanese is master of the political transaction, but he remains emotional and empathetic. Believing in things and accumulating the power you need to deliver them sometimes involves hiding until you are strong enough to prevail, and sometimes brawling until your knuckles bleed. Now that we are back on familiar territory, I point out that Scott Morrison believes he’s in a message war, not a conversation. Morrison won in 2019 by treating the campaign as a message war, and he’s adopted the same approach this time. Albanese isn’t communicating as though he’s in a message war. He’s in a dialogue with voters. I’m not sure that conversations win elections, not in an age as cluttered and superficial and dangerously untethered as this. Albanese says he wants to be prime minister, not chief tactician, or a campaign director in exile, like Morrison. What he’s trying to do is show people how he would lead. “Part of what you have to do from opposition is reflect the character you would be in government,” he says. “You can’t just flick a switch.” Albanese says Tony Abbott’s style of opposition leadership – reductionist, brutal, hyper partisan – changed Australian politics fundamentally, and not for the better. “You have to treat the Australian people with respect,” he says. “You have to give them more than a slogan and spin. I think that’s an investment in national cohesion.” But what if it’s not possible to win that way? He shrugs. “I am who I am. I’ve led Labor in a way in which I’d want to lead government … One of the problems of this government and the reason for this failure this term is they went through an election [in 2019] bagging us and not having any coherent policy agenda. That’s reflected in a government that is incoherent and idling. There is no reason [for this government] to exist other than Scott Morrison being able to occupy a position. That’s not my objective. My objective is to leave a legacy, to make a difference, otherwise I don’t know why anyone would do this.” I leave his campaign bus on Wednesday. On Thursday, the pub trivia is whether Albanese can name the six points of his disability policy. He can’t. A sonic boom of Albanese’s new brain fade ensues on the nightly news and colleagues fight despair about the vacuousness of these tests, raging at the gap between the stagecraft and the gravity of the challenges the country faces. They fear the impossibility of the task. The Labor leader disappears into a huddle of preparation for an appearance on the Q&A program. The audience lifts him. He steps through that unscathed. By Friday morning, Albanese is back in his neighbourhood, back with the hunting pack. This time he’s brought his water and he’s sheltered in shade. He sips at the start of the press conference. From my desk in Canberra, I can see his brain working; something gathering. When the questions start, I see an Albanese I’ve lost sight of as he’s tried to be better, tried to do what the party needs him to do. I see the person who feels as much as he calculates. I see a person who didn’t find his father until his mother died because he didn’t want to hurt her. I see a person who wants to be prime minister to give battlers the same opportunities as he had. He probably should be in a marginal seat, kissing a baby, talking about the childcare policy. But he’s home in Grayndler, renewing his purpose by following the breadcrumb trails of his life. The citizens of “Albo country” are milling around the edges of this press conference, willing him to succeed. This morning, Albanese hasn’t got Labor’s six point NDIS plan, or the price of a lettuce, or a slick soundbite. But he’s got lived experience. Fire in the belly, heart on the sleeve, film of moisture in the eyes. Albanese can tell the journalists what disability support services are for. Services restore dignity to people like his mother, who had to bump down a flight of steps on her backside because she couldn’t walk. This isn’t soundbite politics. This isn’t the package, but politics with purpose. Politics about something. Politics with some skin in the game. Before I left him, I asked Albanese what he would do if he lost. He hopes he can win this, but he doesn’t know if he can. He knows his game plan has kept Labor in this contest, but he doesn’t know if he can close it. “I’m focused on getting a majority Labor government on the 21st of May,” he says. But what happens if you lose? “I am focused on that. That’s my sole focus.” You aren’t having nightmares about other possibilities? Morrison’s second late May miracle? “I’m just focused. I’ve been focused for three years on a strategy I outlined on the day I became Labor leader.”",News/Australia news,‘I am who I am’: Anthony Albanese rushes towards his date with destiny,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/07/i-am-who-i-am-anthony-albanese-rushes-towards-his-date-with-destiny
5/7/2022,"It was the worst of times. And it was also the worst of times. It is easy – and also probably best – to forget the most recent spike of Premier League Covid chaos, a febrile few weeks of Omicron-mayhem either side of Christmas that has now dissolved into just another note in the mildly hallucinogenic flipchart of crises and collapses that comprises the last two and a half years. Scroll back five months and those dark December weeks were deeply unsettled. There were whispers of another cancelled Christmas, of surges and spikes and circuit-breaker lockdowns. And of course in the middle of all this football kept trying to happen. Seventeen Premier League games were postponed between mid-December and New Year’s Day. The 20 Premier League managers met to discuss a “firebreak” in the Premier League. Antonio Conte used a set of mannequins to make up the numbers in Spurs training, with no obvious falling away on the standards set during the Nuno Espírito Santo era. Jürgen Klopp began to talk about clubs not signing vaccine refuseniks as Covid blanked players’ names out of the squad lists. And in the middle of all this Tottenham Hotspur hosted Liverpool on a dark, slightly crazed Sunday afternoon, with a feeling of mix and match teams, players picked out of a hat, tactics improvised on the hoof, and everyone just glad still to be out there moving around before the world closed in again. As Spurs travel to Anfield on Saturday night for a game that could provide a decisive edge in the closing spasms of both the Premier League title race and the Battle For Fourth Place, there are two things worth remembering about that December fixture. First, it was a stone-cold forgotten classic, a ragged startlingly carefree game of football, and the most outrageously loose and wild Premier League game of the season. Neither team had been able to train properly. Klopp seemed to be taking daily Covid hits to his stricken squad. Conte had been around for only seven games anyway. Both teams might have scored eight but ended up with two. Andy Robertson was sent off. Harry Kane should have been. The whole game was a constant whirl of frantic, skittering movement. At the end Klopp came on to the pitch and told Paul Tierney: “I have no problems with any referees, only you; you have never played football.” And somehow five months on, in a league that has resumed its orderly state, its fine-point details, that unbound 2–2 draw could end up having a decisive effect on the season’s final standings. Liverpool had come into that game on a run of eight wins. They left the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium having entered their one real wobble of the season. A draw with Chelsea and defeat at Leicester followed, seven points dropped in two weeks. By the middle of January Liverpool were 11 points behind Manchester City. Thirteen league wins in 14 games since then – the other a 2-2 draw at City – have transformed that two-hander at the top into the more familiar shared neurosis of tiny details, pegged out around constant high-wire weekly victories. In a title race with no air and no space those dropped points in the time of Covid look crucial. Fittingly Saturday’s return, another slightly ominous looking night game, also has an epic feel. For Liverpool this is surely the toughest remaining league fixture. Win this one and the run-in looks doable. But they will face opponents whose own season is still entirely in the balance, and whose progress to this point has in many ways revolved around that first game in December. It was Conte’s fifth league game in charge, and the first real sign of substance, of wheels starting to move behind the scowling, the barking, the performative energy. Looking back there was even a tactical element to the chaos. Spurs played a deep, flat back five that day, and channeled their attacking transitions through long diagonal passes beyond Liverpool’s high defensive line, another bespoke Conte tactic. The results highlighted some obvious strengths. Kane had one league goal and one assist in 13 games to that point. He has 12 goals and seven assists in 20 since. Son Heung-min, who was Spurs’ best player in December, has been in revelatory form since, and is now only three goals behind Mo Salah for the season. Liverpool are too good, too efficient, too hot right now to approach a league game at Anfield in anything other than blitzkrieg mode. Klopp is unlikely to alter his tactics, beyond applying greater pressure to the Spurs midfield and cutting off the supply into those spaces. There is a sense that their peak levels, the constant physical pressure, the rotations of the forward players will eventually overwhelm any opponent. But the fact is Spurs have the weapons and the attacking patterns to find space behind the Liverpool full-backs. This is how they beat Manchester City in February. Kane’s ability to find passes into space for runners behind the defence is an ideal weapon against teams that condense the backline and midfield into a zone of control around halfway. They have the capacity to score at Anfield. There have been clean sheets, too, for Conte’s team on the current mini-run. If this sounds like a rather hopeful prognosis for a team that lost the seven games against Liverpool before December’s meeting, then Spurs can reflect that they have been significant opponents in other ways in recent times. Klopp’s first game in English football was a furious 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane against an early Mauricio Pochettino vintage. The 4-1 defeat at Wembley in October 2017 was a kind of flick of the switch on the full-blown Klopp era. Spurs had finished second, 10 points ahead of Liverpool the season before. Virgil van Dijk arrived three months later. Salah ended the season on a wild scoring run. And those positions have been decisively reversed ever since, Klopp’s Liverpool entering their imperial phase. They have a quadruple in their sights now. Jordan Henderson and Joël Matip are both likely to return to a full-strength team. There is a sense of irresistible momentum around this team right now, of destiny, fate, willpower and all the other things that seemed to spook Manchester City in midweek. One thing does seem certain. It’s quite likely to be wild again.",Sport/Football,Wild draw shows how Conte’s Spurs can derail Liverpool quadruple hopes | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/06/contes-spurs-have-attacking-weapons-to-derail-liverpool-quadruple-hopes
5/7/2022,"Spending time in the great outdoors is good for your mental health, according to a growing body of research. For example, getting out and about in forests and parks has been shown to increase happiness and alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. But are the benefits universal? A review paper notes that most studies in this field look at rich, white, western populations, and scientists say this results in an incomplete picture of the health benefits. Carlos Andres Gallegos-Riofrío, of the University of Vermont’s Gund Institute for Environment, whose findings have been published in Current Research in Environmental Sustainability, says indigenous populations like those he studies in South America have different relationships with nature to other people. He says it is important to learn how their mental health is affected by this different rapport. Gallegos-Riofro and colleagues at the University of Vermont examined 174 peer-reviewed studies from the last decade and found more than 95% of research was conducted in high-income western nations of the US, Europe and east Asia. Only 4% of studies looked at nations of medium income, such as India, and no low-income countries featured in the studies. Only one study took place in Africa and one in South America. Of the participants whose ethnicity was known, most were white. Rachelle Gould, a researcher at University of Vermont’s Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, said: “There’s nothing necessarily wrong with the existing findings, those findings are important, but we have reason to believe they may not apply to the entire population. In order to allow this work to influence sustainability action and to move us towards sustainability, we need to know which of these effects are universal and which are culturally specific.” Making this distinction can lead to fair policy changes, Gould says. The study builds on the concept of “Weird psychology”, a term coined by the evolutionary biologist Joseph Henrich. The acronym refers to how experiments that focus mainly on college students from western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic (Weird) parts of the world cannot allow scientists to draw universal conclusions about human behaviour. “This research strikingly demonstrates a massive bias in the sampling of global populations towards those that are Weird,” said Henrich, who was not involved in the study. “This limits our ability to generalise about the phenomenon under investigation.” Henrich said it would be useful to expand research to include more diverse populations and use culturally sensitive tools adapted to the people being studied.",News/World news,Studies on nature’s mental health benefits show ‘massive’ western bias,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/studies-on-natures-mental-health-benefits-show-massive-western-bias
