1/4/2022,"Police in India have arrested a woman accused of organising a fake online auction in which hundreds of prominent female Muslims were put up “for sale” on a website. There were shock waves of anger and disgust in India after it emerged that a website calling itself Bulli Bai, an offensive term for Muslims, had set up a pretend auction of more than 100 Muslim women, including journalists, academics, activists, scholars and artists, where they were to be “sold” as servants for negligible sums.  Although no real transactions took place, the Bulli Bai website featured photos of the women, many taken from their social media and manipulated. A large number of the women targeted have been vocal critics of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government and many said the purpose of the site was to humiliate and silence outspoken Muslim women and help fracture India down sectarian lines. It is the second recent attack where Muslim women in India have been harassed by being “sold” online, and comes after a similar fake auction held online last July. Though several police complaints were filed in that case, no one has been arrested. The Bulli Bai website was removed within 24 hours, and several police complaints were filed by victims in Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad. On Tuesday, Mumbai police said they had arrested two people in connection with setting up the website, including a woman in Uttarakhand who is the main accused, and a male engineering student in Bengaluru. Sayema Rahman, a popular radio DJ, found out she was among those featured on the website when a screenshot of her name and face was sent to her by a journalist. “The most shocking part is that I’m not shocked any more because this has been happening relentlessly to women for quite some time now, especially with this communal angle,” said Rahman. It’s Islamophobia coupled with misogyny. I was targeted, and a whole lot of other women were targeted, because we are the vocal voices, we are the liberated voices, and they want to silence us by commodifying us, humiliating us and trying to scare us.” Rahman said victims were still waiting for the prime minister, Narendra Modi, or the central government, in particular the home ministry and the ministry for women, to condemn the Bulli Bai website. “This is a massive national scandal but we are yet to hear a word from the central government condemning this or offering assurances, and that is very unsettling and very unnerving for the safety of women in this country,” she said. Speaking to the Guardian, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the IT minister, said his department’s investigative unit had looked into the website, and those responsible would be prosecuted. “The government of India is committed to ensuring the internet is open, trusted and safe for all Indians. We take this responsibility very seriously,” he said. Khalida Parveen, 67, a veteran activist, was also among the women targeted. On Monday, she filed a police complaint in her home city of Hyderabad against the perpetrators, and the GitHub platform that had facilitated the site. A GitHub spokesperson said it had taken down the user account that had hosted the website, and would cooperate with investigating authorities. Parveen, in her police complaint, called for the perpetrators to be charged with “harassing me, horribly sexualising me, a senior citizen, and casting aspersions on me, and my character, and the community to which I belong” and also to be charged with human trafficking. She said she had been “sad and angry” when she learned she was among those targeted. “What kind of mindset do these people have, selling me, an old lady, and other women online?” Parveen asked. “They are trying to silence our voices on social media. We see again how under this government, Muslim women are targets.” Parveen said she felt the auction aimed to punish prominent female Muslim voices, including journalists and activists, who had called out hate speech against Muslims – such as a recent call by Hindu religious leaders, during a religious event in the Hindu holy city of Haridwar, in Uttarakhand, for a genocide of Muslims in India. “Many of us were on social media, drawing international attention to this hate speech and demanding police cases be filed against the perpetrators,” she said. “Then we are all put up for sale on this auction. I think it is an attempt to scare us, make us fearful to raise our voices so we keep quiet. But we are all fighting this together, we will be aggressive for justice.”",News/World news,Arrests after female Muslim activists put up for sale in fake auction in India,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/arrests-after-female-muslim-activists-put-up-for-sale-in-fake-auction-in-india
1/4/2022,"The extremist Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene “might be a Democrat – or just an idiot” – according to a fellow hardline conservative.  Dan Crenshaw, a Texas congressman and former Navy Seal, threw the barb back at the Georgia congresswoman in a spat over his support for using the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to operate Covid testing sites. The US is experiencing a crippling surge of Covid cases thanks to the infectious Omicron variant, with more than 1m recorded on Monday and lack of access to testing hampering state and federal responses. Greene has consistently spread Covid conspiracy theories. On Sunday, she was permanently suspended from Twitter, for spreading misinformation. That drew support from Donald Trump, who without discernible irony called Twitter “a disgrace to democracy”, said Greene had “a huge constituency of honest, patriotic, hard-working people”, and added: “Keep fighting, Marjorie!” Regardless, on Monday Greene was temporarily suspended from Facebook, for spreading misinformation. She took aim at Crenshaw on Instagram, writing: “No Fema should not set up testing sites to check for Omicron sneezes, coughs and runny noses.“And we don’t need Fema in hospitals, they should hire back all the unvaccinated [healthcare workers] they fired.“He needs to stop calling himself conservative, he’s hurting our brand.” Crenshaw responded on Instagram, saying: “Hey, Marjorie, if suggesting we should follow Trump policy instead of Biden mandates makes you mad, then you might be a Democrat – or just an idiot.” Greene has been repeatedly fined for failing to wear a mask on the floor of the House of Representatives. Crenshaw, however, has his own history of provocative behaviour. As the Houston Chronicle pointed out, “Before calling for federally funded testing sites, Crenshaw used to share wild posts to social media, before Greene took office, including posting action movie-style videos of him beating up Antifa members.” More than 827,000 people have died in the US from Covid-19.",News/US news,"Marjorie Taylor Greene a ‘Democrat or an idiot’, fellow Republican says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/04/marjorie-taylor-greene-spat-republican-dan-crenshaw

1/4/2022,"A suspected member of the group involved in the murder last year of Haiti’s president, Jovenel Moïse, has been detained while transiting through Panama after his release by a court in Jamaica. Mario Antonio Palacios, 43, a former member of the Colombian military, is accused by Haitian authorities of being part of a mercenary group that tortured and killed Moïse and wounded his wife, Martine, during an attack on Moïse’s private home in July.  Palacios has admitted in a media interview being in Moïse’s bedroom during the assault in which the president died, but has denied being involved in the killing. Palacios entered Jamaica illegally and was detained in prison after his arrest in October while the courts considered an application from Haiti for his extradition. Jamaica instead ordered his deportation to Colombia, but while transiting to his home country via Panama he was intercepted at the airport and is believed to have been put on a flight to the US, which, like Haiti, has issued an Interpol red notice requesting his arrest. Panama authorities have issued no public comment on the affair but a person familiar with the matter in Panama confirmed that Palacios had been detained. A video shared with Reuters by the source, who declined to be identified, showed two immigration agents escorting a man, whose face was not shown, through what appeared to be Panama’s airport. The Colombian television channel Noticias RCN also reported the detention. An official source quoted by the Colombian news site El Tiempo said: “It seems very certain that Palacios will be sent to the United States because the [legal] process there was pushed forward urgently and they have a plane ready for him.” According to some reports, Palacios was being taken to Miami. Palacios’s detention in Panama marks the latest twist in the saga of the investigation into Moise’s assassination, which remains largely mired in mystery. Jamaican authorities ruled that Haiti’s request for Palacios’s extradition did not meet its legal requirements. “This request, as a matter of law, could not proceed, could not be processed and was destined to fail,” said Paula Llewellyn, Jamaica’s director of public prosecutions (DPP), on Friday. According to reports, Palacios had not been named as a suspect in the murder but was instead being sought on a charge of armed robbery. It appeared at the weekend that the Colombian would be allowed to travel home after he was photographed shaking hands with the Colombian ambassador to Jamaica, Jairo Clopatofsky Ghisays. Palacios is believed to be the last of the alleged group of mercenaries to be detained. In an interview given while he was still in hiding, he insisted he had no knowledge of who killed Moïse. “I don’t know who killed him. I say it from the heart for my family, for my children,” he told the Week, though he did admit he had entered Moïse’s house. According to a report prepared by the Haitian police and leaked to various media outlets, Palacios – also known by his nickname of “Floro” – is accused of being one of the instigators of Moïse’s assassination on 7 July. He is accused of being one of 26 Colombians and two Haitian Americans who made up a hit squad that stormed the president’s private residence in the middle of the night claiming to be part of a US Drug Enforcement Administration operation. Moïse was shot a dozen times and also appeared to have had an eye gouged out during the assault. None of the surviving Colombians captured in Haiti have yet been put on trial, and the motivation behind the assassination remains unclear amid contradictory claims. On Saturday, gunmen tried to kill Haiti’s prime minister, Ariel Henry, during an event to mark the anniversary of the country’s independence, officials say. The incident happened at a church in the northern city of Gonaïves. Video posted online showed the prime minister and his entourage scrambling toward their cars amid intense gunfire.",News/World news,Suspect linked to killing of Haiti’s president is detained in Panama,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/suspect-linked-to-killing-of-haitis-president-is-detained-in-panama
1/4/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s brand new gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email.  Well done everyone, we made it through to 2022. Has anyone else’s brain lost the ability to distinguish between “holiday at home with the kids” and “lockdown at home with the kids”? After 14 days ‘off’ I am very ready to be somewhere completely silent, and perhaps be able to play a video game for longer than 20 minutes without either being asked for a snack, or falling asleep. There’s a lot to look forward to this year, not least all the big games that we were supposed to be playing in 2021. There are so many open-world timesinks, especially, that I don’t know how anyone is supposed to fit all of them in. If you want to know what I will be doing in late February and the entirety of March, the answer is Elden Ring. Dark Souls meets Breath of the Wild! Get it in my veins! Speaking of Breath of the Wild, the sequel to the most expansive (and, in my opinion, the greatest) Zelda game will be out sometime this year as well. Then there’s Horizon: Forbidden West, a game about a flame-haired female warrior fighting robot dinosaurs, a game that I’m pretty sure I made up in my dreams at the age of 11. Somehow I almost forgot about Starfield, the first big Bethesda game since Fallout 4, an explorable sci-fi universe that I still know tantalisingly little about. Will Mass Effect finally have some competition? – – – Traditionally it takes a few years for new games consoles to bed in, and for developers to really explore what they can achieve with the technology. Though the Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5 had a few standouts last year, by the end of 2022 there’s going to be a proper catalogue of new blockbusters. Of course, actually buying a new console to play them on is still, more than a year after launch, a total scramble. Supply-chain issues and huge demand as a result of ongoing global lockdowns have contributed to a scarcity that has had people frantically hitting refresh on Amazon and Game restocks, mindful that they’ll all be sold out again in minutes (or snapped up by bots, to be resold on eBay at an infuriating mark-up). This problem is likely to persist through 2022, Sony’s CFO Hiroki Totoki has admitted. It’s never been so difficult to buy into the next generation of video games. But then: do you really need to? I have always felt that buying a games console in the first year or two of its life is only necessary if you get a real kick out of technological novelty. For most people, there is no rush. We are long past the time when games became unplayably aged after a few years on the shelves. Though only a few games from my 90s childhood could be unreservedly recommended today – pity anybody coming fresh to GoldenEye on the N64, with its bizarre single-stick controls and muddy graphics – pretty much all of the best games of, say, 2010 are a) still just as good and b) still available to buy. Sometimes I rather miss the thrill I used to get from tracking down a coveted retro game on eBay, or from digging through baskets of cartridges in Japanese game stories in the late 00s and coming across a copy of some obscure sumo-wrestling game I once saw in a copy of Super Play. But it’s also undeniably a good thing that you can instantly download or even stream the vast majority of games released in the last decade, when we used to have to go to such lengths. The video games industry is obsessed with the new. As a technology-driven art form, new tech has always been part of the deal. But now more than ever, it’s not what defines games. If you’ve not got a next-gen console yet, you’re not missing out on much. 95% of the joy of this medium is available to you regardless. Over the Christmas break I dipped into a few games that I hadn’t found time for over the course of the year, and one that stood out was Unpacking, the story of a life told through the act of moving house. Each chapter presents you with a diorama of a home (a childhood bedroom, a college dorm, a cosy one-bed), into which you must somehow fit all of the stuff jumbled into your cardboard boxes. I found this game soothing – it has an implied narrative that is quite sweet, if also very predictable – until I started playing with my partner, who methodically Tetrised everything on to shelves and surfaces however they would fit, like a psychopath. Given that one of this game’s themes is how to fit your possessions (and therefore your life) in around someone else’s, it felt appropriate that we were low-level arguing about how to arrange a virtual kitchen. Available on: Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One/Series X/S, PCApproximate playtime: 3.5 hours The games industry is busy in-fighting over NFTs, the latest solution-to-a-problem-that-doesn’t-exist from the techbro universe, and also one of the most depressing trends I have encountered in all my years covering this business. Ubisoft has introduced them to its games, but nobody wants to buy them. Square-Enix’s CEO has declared his hopes that they become a major trend, which seems rather ambitious as they have yet to be proven useful for anything except Internet flexing. Having spent several months gaining a better understanding of NFTs and cryptocurrency this year, and listened to a few developers evangelise them (and more developers spit fury over them), I have found no better summary than this Gawker piece about the total soul-deadening dumbness of the entire scene as it stands: “world-altering technology is now in the hands of a culture so aesthetically and spiritually impoverished that it should maybe go back to telling stories around the cooking fire for a while, just to remember how to mean something.” You’ve read the Guardian’s 10 games to look forward to in 2022, right? It is becoming a running joke that every year, about half of the games on it fail to actually come out in the year they’re supposed to. A full 6 of the 10 games I picked for the 2021 list are still unreleased, and one of the 2020 games to watch still isn’t finished. Anyway, if you are looking for more games to look forward to and then be disappointed by when they entirely fail to materialise, Polygon has put out a list of 50.

This week, reader Lawal Muhammad asks: Which recent games made you feel happiest/most content while playing them? For me there are three kinds of game that give me happy brain chemicals: anything involving playing to music (Guitar Hero, Tetris Effect, Rez), which induce a kind of flow-state euphoria; games with predictable, repetitive, gentle rhythms that you can sink right into (Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, old-school Harvest Moon), which create a sense of safety; and absolutely mad nonsense that makes me laugh and gives me something unexpected, feeding my insatiable need for novelty. So the games that made me happiest recently were Psychonauts 2, a game about delving into people’s brains that brought a delightfully weird buffet of different game concepts, visual gags and in-jokes to the table, and It Takes Two, a genre mashup about a divorcing couple that completely changes itself around every hour or so.

1/4/2022,"I have enjoyed a long-distance relationship with my partner for five years. We are both male and used to enjoy a healthy sex life, often enjoying the time we were together, knowing we would not see each other for a few weeks. Sex seemed to be a reciprocal, affectionate adventure that occasionally included a third person to spice things up. We have since moved in together and now it seems that I am the one doing all the work. Most of the initiation and certainly all of the imagination, seems to be coming from me. I don’t feel he is attracted to me or interested in me physically any more. This weekend, he wanted to go out to a gay sauna, but I didn’t, so he went alone. Which would be fine if we were enjoying a healthy sex life, but we’re not. So the open part has now replaced our own intimate life. I feel that this is a significant change. He won’t talk about it, other than to say I am being insecure, hypocritical or unreasonable. To be honest, I have doubted myself because I too have enjoyed the benefits of the open relationship but only when they were the icing on the cake, not the cake itself. How do I reignite our own sex life? Your disappointment at the lack of ease you are experiencing in segueing into this new phase is understandable, but, for now, you will have to lower your expectations. Such a significant change in a relationship typically requires time and careful negotiation. There is probably nothing wrong with your sex life itself – you just need to discuss your individual needs and desires and try to reach a workable understanding. Some couples are better off not living together, but it is too early to know if you meet that criteria. In addition, all kinds of extra issues arise in open relationships and you will have to tackle these one at a time. Be very specific in your negotiations: you could suggest for example, “Could we agree to take turns initiating sex?” Many relationships – of all types – fail when one partner feels the unspoken contract is an unfair one. And sexual interest can be lowered due to the accompanying underlying resentment. It would be best to address it, gently, as soon as possible.

1/4/2022,"The French government has heavily criticised opposition MPs after a parliamentary debate on the proposed introduction of a “vaccine pass” was unexpectedly suspended after members of the Assemblée nationale voted with a show of hands to go home. The move came after seven hours of often-heated exchanges on Monday, when ministers clashed with critics over the controversial measure due to be introduced on 15 January, but now postponed.  Government spokesperson Gabriel Attal on Tuesday accused opposition MPs of playing politics and halting the adoption of what he said were “essential measures … in an urgent situation”. He said the government would push on with the controversial legislation. The proposal is to turn the current “health pass” requiring either vaccination, recovery from Covid or a negative Covid test into a “vaccine pass” requiring people to be fully vaccinated if they wish to access restaurants, bars, museums, cinemas, theatres, long distance trains, hotels and many other public places. Hospitals and health establishments would not require a “vaccine pass”. The debate, which began on Monday afternoon, was due to continue into the early hours of Tuesday and there were more than 500 amendments still to be debated when the parliamentary session was suspended shortly before midnight. Earlier, the prime minister, Jean Castex, had told the house the government could not accept that 5.3 million people remained unvaccinated in France. The new pass was intended to introduce “heavier constraints on the non-vaccinated”, he admitted. France is currently reporting an average of around 160,000 new Covid cases a day. “The tidal wave has indeed arrived. It’s enormous, but we will not give in to panic,” the health minister, Olivier Véran, told MPs. Facing vehement attacks from the far right Rassemblement National (RN) and far left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed – LFI) over the infringement of civil liberties, Véran added “selfishness often hides behind talk of supposed liberties”. Most MPs from Emmanuel Macron’s centrist La République en Marche (La REM) party and the mainstream opposition Les Républicains (LR) support the measure. “Last night we saw a form of irresponsible friendship being formed with the MPs of La France Insoumise, the Rassemblement National and LR to derail the timetable for the adoption of the vaccine pass,” Attal told France Inter radio. “The vaccine pass has to come into effect as quickly as possible,” Attal added. Far left presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon of LFI, who had called for the new legislation to be rejected, accused the government of having “sown indescribable chaos because of your short-sightedness” and accused Véran of “arrogance”. He called for “a global plan” and poured scorn on “measures on those who have the right to eat popcorn or drink their coffee standing or sitting”. Critics also accused the government, which is one-seat short of an absolute parliamentary majority, of amateurism after it found itself without enough MPs present in the lower house to defeat the vote to suspend. Alexis Corbière of LFI said members of the governing party were to blame for the stalemate. “LREM MPs weren’t sufficiently mobilised last night and found themselves in a minority. It’s absolutely their fault,” he tweeted. The new legislation would also introduce heavier penalties for those using fake vaccine passes or venues that fail to check people’s vaccine status of up to five years in prison and €75,000 (£63,000) fines.",News/World news,French opposition MPs criticised after Covid vaccine pass debate suspended,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/french-opposition-mps-criticised-after-vaccine-pass-debate-suspended
