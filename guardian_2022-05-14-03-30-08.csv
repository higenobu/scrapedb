5/14/2022,"Coleen Rooney has been told she cannot provide “one shred of evidence” that Rebekah Vardy leaked stories from a private Instagram account to the Sun – but insisted she has strong reason to “believe” Vardy was responsible based on circumstantial clues. Rooney told the “Wagatha Christie” libel trial that leaks from her private Instagram account to the Sun caused issues when she was dealing with difficulties in her marriage to the former footballer Wayne Rooney. She said one private Instagram post in 2017 made its way to the tabloid at a time her and Rooney were “trying to figure out our relationship” and they were spending time apart, after he crashed his car while drink-driving with another woman. She said it was upsetting when the Sun learned of the private photo, which suggested the family were back together. “I didn’t know how my marriage was going to work out and whether I was going on with my relationship,” she told the high court in London. “We needed to try and work things out.” Vardy’s lawyer, Hugh Tomlinson QC, put it to Coleen Rooney that there was not “a shred of evidence” that Vardy had leaked private Instagram material about the couple to the Sun. He suggested that another one of Rooney’s 300-plus followers may have been responsible for passing information to journalists at the tabloid. Rooney said: “It was someone who was on my Instagram account and I believe that it was Mrs Vardy.” Tomlinson replied: “I didn’t ask what you believe, I asked if you could be sure.” He repeatedly told Rooney that beliefs do not count as hard evidence: “You might believe Derby County might win the Premiership in two years’ time. It’s not evidence is it?” Wayne Rooney, the Derby County manager, did not react when he heard the jibe about his football team, who have been recently relegated to League One – the third tier of English football – amid financial difficulties. Coleen Rooney is being sued for libel by fellow footballer’s wife Vardy, who denies Rooney’s public accusation that she passed stories from Rooney’s Instagram account to the tabloid newspaper. Vardy is married to the Leicester City striker, Jamie Vardy. Rooney insisted there is overwhelming evidence that Vardy’s Instagram account was accessing the leaked material. “I thought a lot about this,” she said. “I’ve been in the public eye for 20 years. I’ve become quite savvy to the way people work and journalists work. I hate gossips, I’m not a gossip. It all added up to me that it came from this account.” She said she became “really suspicious” that Vardy was leaking to the Sun because Vardy actively sought publicity for herself, had previously provided exclusives to the Sun and had exchanged unusual messages with Rooney. Early in 2019 Rooney blocked Vardy from viewing the account, only for Vardy to message her and ask for access to be restored. Rooney said this complaint made her even more suspicious that Vardy was responsible for the leaks – leading her to run a now-infamous sting operation where Rooney posted fake updates in order to see which ended up as stories in the Sun. Under cross-examination, Rooney repeatedly detailed her strong dislike of the Sun newspaper and said her life “has been picked apart by the media for the last 20 years”. In an early pretrial hearing a judge ruled that the true meaning of Rooney’s 2019 public accusation that “it’s ……… Rebekah Vardy’s account” leaking to the Sun was a direct allegation against Vardy herself – rather than simply anyone with access to Vardy’s account. As the person who made the accusation, it is up to Rooney to prove that her claim was truthful or in the public interest. For her part Vardy has argued that her agent, Caroline Watt, may have been leaking the material to the Sun without her knowledge. Although Vardy has acknowledged that her agent was discussing private information about Rooney with a Sun journalist, she has insisted that she was not the original source of any leaks. Rooney told the court that paparazzi take pictures of her “most days” and her life in the US, where she moved to be with her husband in 2018 while he played for DC United, had been miserable. She said she “cried every night” while living overseas because she missed her family and the leak of a private Instagram story about a supposed car crash to the Sun made it harder. She told the court: “I don’t understand why the press are interested in most things – I wouldn’t want to read the stuff they write about me because most of what they write about me is ridiculous.” Vardy’s lawyer replied: “That may be something we can agree on.” Earlier in the day Vardy finished being cross-examined after four days of evidence in which she was accused of habitually leaking information to the Sun, destroying evidence on purpose, and helping journalists obtain information about Rooney. Vardy said the experience of being cross-examined was “exhausting” and “intimidating”. But stood by the decision to bring the case in order to restore her public reputation. “I didn’t do anything wrong and I want to clear my name, not just for me but for my family and my children,” she said.

5/14/2022,"There’s bad luck in store this Friday the 13th. Not just for all those involved with Blumhouse’s limp new take on Stephen King’s Firestarter but also for the cursed few who’ll end up watching a misbegotten theatrical release wisely coupled with a more modest US streaming launch on Peacock. Whatever the screen size, it’s a non-starter. Based on one of the author’s less engaging yet still successful books, mixing elements of Carrie and The Dead Zone, straddling sci-fi, adventure and horror, Firestarter modernises a story that we now see far, far too often. Since its release in 1980 and the first adaptation in 1984, Hollywood has been consumed by the possibilities of superpowers, mostly on an increasingly, dizzyingly large stage but also in smaller self-contained stories. As Everything Everywhere All At Once continues to ride high, alongside the release of Marvel’s Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness and Eskil Vogt’s The Innocents, we’re reminded that both arthouse and multiplex have reached superpower saturation. It’s perhaps why the arrival of Firestarter is even more of a bore, retelling a story we know all too well and don’t need to hear yet again. After some promising credits, stylishly filling in the backstories of college student couple Andy (Zac Efron) and Vicky (Sydney Lemmon) and the nefarious testing they choose to take part in, we fast forward to see the family they’ve now made with 11-year-old daughter Charlie (Ryan Kiera Armstrong). They live remotely without any phones or wifi, moving when needed, a constant shroud of mystery to hide their identities and powers. Vicky has a mild, untrained form of telekinesis, Andy has psychic abilities and Charlie has pyrokinesis, turning things and people into fire when her emotions are at their most extreme. After an accident at school, things start to fall apart at home and their cover is blown. What follows is a maddeningly tension-free chase narrative as the family tries to evade capture from another superpowered test subject gone rogue (Michael Greyeyes) and the malevolent agent (Gloria Reubens) who hired him. Director Keith Thomas’s pacing is as flat as his visuals, a shame given the buzz that surrounded his 2019 horror The Vigil, his latest a dramatic downturn for a genre film-maker already consumed by the system. Firestarter is as anonymous and unnecessary as they come, the kind of dated “just because” remake that cluttered up cinemas in the 2000s. While the original is far from indispensable (it’s also rather dull), at the very least it provided a showcase for a young Drew Barrymore, who gave a typically precocious and persuasive performance. There’s nothing even close to that here although Efron, smoothly graduating to dad roles, uses his easy movie star charisma to rise above the lethargy of the film surrounding him. Scott Teems’s drearily perfunctory script is at least not as howlingly bad as his script for Halloween Kills, a small mercy, although both films bizarrely share John Carpenter in charge of the music, his throwback synth score working at odds with Thomas’s pedestrian aesthetic. No one here seems to know what they’re doing and, more importantly, why. A strong contender for 2022’s most pointless movie. Firestarter is now out in UK and US cinemas and is also available to stream in the US on Peacock",Arts/Film,Firestarter review – soggy Stephen King remake struggles to ignite,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/13/firestarter-review-stephen-king-zac-efron-sydney-lemmon-ryan-kiera-armstrong
5/14/2022,"Households have been warned that the UK’s “golden era” of cheap food is over, as official figures published on Friday pointed to the toll of the cost of living crisis, with two in five people buying less food to get by. The former Sainsbury’s boss Justin King said shoppers now faced hard choices over how to spend their money as the financial shock, caused by the war in Ukraine, pushes up prices on supermarket shelves. “We have been perhaps through a golden era,” said King , a senior figure in the retail industry who also sits on the board of Marks & Spencer. This would now have to change, he added, with people forced to rethink priorities in their family budgets. “I suspect what we will see is a higher proportion, across the piece, spent on food for the longer term.” His concerns were echoed by senior figures across the retail and farming industries, as households prepare to weather a surge in inflation. Economists believe official statistics next Wednesday will show that overall prices increased 9% in April, while the Bank of England is forecasting the rate will pass 10% later this year, the highest since 1982. The head of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents all the major supermarkets, agreed that “consumers are in for a difficult time”. Global food prices are at a record high, propelled by growing energy and transport costs, as well as an extremely tight labour market, its chief executive Helen Dickinson said. Fierce competition among supermarkets has so far limited price rises on essential products, but Dickinsonsaid pressures in the food industry “do not look to be easing anytime soon”. The cost of living crisis is already forcing people to make big changes. Two in five adults are buying less food when they go shopping, according to the latest public opinions and social trends survey published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday. The figure is double the reading at the start of 2022. Nine out of 10 of the adults polled told the ONS their outgoings were higher this month than last. When they were first asked, back in November, just 62% of adults said this was the case. The three big worries were food and energy bills, and the price at the pumps. People were cutting back spending on non-essentials, trying to use less power and heating, and avoiding unnecessary trips in their cars. They had also started shopping around more to find the cheapest prices. Two in five did not think they would be able to save any money in the next 12 months. Runaway prices were forcing people to make some “really horrible financial decisions”, said Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The number of people having to spend less on food was “alarming”, she added. “It’s no wonder that a third of us are so anxious.” Coles said the ONS survey showed “alarm bells ringing over food”. “The proportion buying less is growing, and while this will include some people who are giving up expensive treats or cutting down on waste, there’s a real risk that some are having to go hungry.” Research for the Guardian by price analysts Assosia last month showed big jumps in the cost of everyday foods, with the price of basic pasta up 45%, tinned tomatoes and eggs up by 13%, and dog food up by more than 40% in the past year. Official data points to a near-20% rise in the price of a pint of milk. Food producers, from pig farmers to cucumber growers, have been warning for months that a surge in the cost of energy and basic commodities, such as wheat and cooking oil, was pushing up their costs and they would have to be passed on. Last week, the National Pig Association said four out of five producers would go out of business within a year unless their finances improved, with farmers losing in excess of £50 a pig. Hundreds of egg producers are also facing collapse as rising fuel and energy costs were exacerbated by the additional cost of keeping hens indoors during a bird flu outbreak. Minette Batters, the NFU president, said egg, chicken and pork producers were among those operating at a loss due to soaring farm costs. The price of energy, fuel, feed and packaging were all “spiralling upwards”, she said. “For all of these input costs, whether it’s packaging or feed, we’re seeing rising inflation. It is costing more, a lot more, to produce the food than it can be sold for. “The question is how we receive fair returns for everybody and make sure that the consumer can still afford to buy,” she added. “The danger is, if you put all of these costs on to the consumer, are they going to be able to afford to buy it?” King told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that supermarkets could not be expected to absorb the extra costs entirely or protect consumers from rising prices, despite having announced higher earnings. Last month, Tesco and Sainsbury’s reported a doubling in their annual pre-tax profits to £2bn and £730m respectively. “The headline profit numbers are of course large in the context of any household budget,” King said. “But the margins in supermarkets are around 3%. So even if supermarkets made no profits at all, they wouldn’t really be able to make a huge dent in the cost inflation that is coming through the system.” The war in Ukraine has added to problems that were already building up in the food industry due to upheaval caused by the pandemic and Brexit as well as crop issues linked to the climate crisis. The recent heatwave in India and dry spells in parts of the US, for example, both of which are large grain producers, have contributed to surging wheat prices around the globe, alongside the squeeze on exports and reduced production in Ukraine. Richard Griffiths, head of the British Poultry Council, which represents producers behind 85% of the chicken sold in the UK, said he couldn’t see “an easy way for food prices to come down again”. “We have seen cost of production increases that mean we are expecting to see food inflation at 15%,” he said. “It’s not just energy prices rises, it is increases in feed costs and labour, the effects of Brexit on trade. If it is was one of those it may be manageable and recoverable, but as it is all of them, it makes life increasingly difficult.”",News/Business,‘Golden era’ of cheap food over as two in five Britons buy less to eat,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/13/cost-of-living-golden-era-of-cheap-food-over
5/14/2022,"Blessed are the Blokes, for they shall inherit the earth. There has been a steady evolution in the governing class of English cricket. For many decades the sport was ruled by the Blazers. The Blazers were faceless. They smelt of crusted port and Chesterfield sofas. They ruled the committee room with an iron liver-spotted fist. Over time they staked out the summer sport as their own private fiefdom. The Blazers were eventually flushed out by the Marketing Men. The Marketing Men were rainmakers and deal-brokers. They didn’t wear blazers. They wore ties and suits. They knew about revenue streams. They made deals and monetised the product. Over time they staked out the summer sport as their own private fiefdom. And now we have the start of something else. Shrunken back, sandblasted by confusing cultural forces, English cricket has entered a new managerial age, at least in its visible faces. Tom Harrison is still hanging in there. But around him there is at least the appearance of change. With the appointment of Rob Key as managing director and Brendon McCullum as Test coach, English cricket is no longer fronted up by blazers or wonks. It is instead being run by … guys. The future is here – and it’s wearing Stan Smiths and tweeting memes. Welcome to the rise of the Blokes. Keysey, Baz, Morgs, Stokesey. This is the new world order in English cricket. Informal, matey, dressed down, banterish. Dudes. Bros. Dudes with views. The Blokes are in the house, and they’ve junked the standard interview process. They know a guy. A really cool guy. And the clincher, the real key, is they’re not like those other people. That’s the big thing. Or at least that seems to be the spin. Perhaps the greatest achievement of the new order to date is convincing the world that this is something new. That, as Key has suggested, the Blokes are in some way outsiders, mavericks, an astringent alternative to the usual “choir boys” who fill leadership roles. In reality of course this is simply a different clique, wearing trainers not brogues, and presenting its lack of qualification and experience as an act of liberation, a tearing down of the barricades. How did we get here anyway? Key didn’t actually apply for the job of managing director of English cricket. He was approached by his golf partner, Andrew Strauss. McCullum was approached in turn by Key, having been recommended by Eoin Morgan, who is one of McCullum’s best mates. McCullum has never coached a red-ball team. Key has never managed anything. Old thinking bro-skis! Key has also never overseen an interview process, but he knew enough to declare that McCullum had “smashed” his one by having vision, vibes, mad energy and the like. So it came to pass. The cool guys are staking the summer sport out as their own private fiefdom. And to be fair these blokes, with their skinny trousers, their cool shades, their everyman vibe, do represent a current version of sporting masculinity: the sensitive alpha guy, banterish and clubbable, but also tattoo-sleeved and gym buffed and, like, totally down with mental health and cool views, more aggressively inclusive than you, high on big no-dickheads energy, on artisan coffee, on semi-ironical yoga, on just being a great guy. And who’s to say it won’t be a success. This is undeniably an exciting time, and a super-talented lineup. What’s not to like about Key? He knows cricket from the ground up. He’s intelligent and strong willed. People who know him seem to adore him. The same goes for McCullum, who is a really impressive person, who knows about teams and systems, and who was a very good orthodox Test cricketer. It’s a change too. We’ve not really had blokes before. We had Peter Moores, who was bright and capable but also resembled a minor Doctor Who seeing out his final series. Trevor Bayliss was good but almost laughably relaxed, basically a hat on a stick. Chris Silverwood tried hard, but was more dad-at-a-barbecue than cool guy head coach. Bring on the bros. This feels, at the very least, like the modern world. And yet, we should be wary of confusing it with something new, or indeed a setup that seems to have any obvious answers beyond hopeful window dressing. McCullum is going to “give England an identity”. That identity will, we hear, be vibrant, and brave and forward looking, because those are words that sound good. Key, meanwhile says he will appoint “the best people”. But who are the best people? There have already been some scathing comments about things like coaching qualifications. Perhaps elite England cricket well now be run on a kind of strongman model, a world of populism and personal appointments. Is this good? Does it make cricket seem more likely to survive and grow? Because beneath the dude-ness of it all there are some uncomfortable truths here. Most obviously, it is laughable that English cricket can preach about inclusion and opening up to new people, and then set up its seat of power in this way, by avoiding due process in favour of phone calls from mates and people who are good on TV. This is the problem, right there: closed shops, invisible barriers, hiring based on good feelings and whoever is in your eyeline. Even odder, those inside this process don’t seem to see any problem with parcelling out power in this way. Er, bros? Not cool. What will success look like from here? Winning games? Playing exciting cricket? Getting people to care? It is telling that such is the sense of doom around this team, this format, that the general response is a kind of hopeful shrug. Keysey has jumped down out of the comms box. The Spice Girls are presenting Top of the Pops. But there is at least talent and energy and charisma here. Like a military coup in a failing state, the Blokes have taken over. We wish them well. Just don’t call it a revolution.",Sport/Sport,The Blazers usurped by the Blokes in English cricket | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/13/the-blazers-have-been-usurped-by-the-blokes-in-crickets-corridors-of-power
5/14/2022,"The biggest civil service union has warned of strike action over Boris Johnson’s “P&O-style” approach to cutting 91,000 Whitehall jobs, with ministers also seeking to reduce staff redundancy terms by up to a third. The plan to cut one in five civil service jobs caused alarm and dismay across government departments, after Johnson told his cabinet to spend the next month finding ways to cut the civil service back to pre-Brexit levels within three years. He claimed it was necessary to shrink the size of central government to tackle the cost of living crisis. The combative move by Johnson, briefed to the Daily Mail, comes on top of existing civil service anger over pay increases less than half of the current 7% rate of inflation, the Cabinet Office drive to get them back into the office and overwork from Covid backlogs. At the same time, ministers have told trade unions that they are also trying to return to previously defeated plans to cut redundancy packages in the civil service by up to 33%. In a further shake-up, Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister and No 10 chief of staff, said all senior civil service jobs would in future have to be advertised externally as well as internally. Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the PCS, representing about 180,000 public sector workers, warned that the civil service had reached the “tipping point” of national strike action being realistic. “We have our conference in 10 days’ time where I’m as certain as I can be that we will move to a national strike ballot, probably in September,” he said. “That was originally because they’re giving a 2% pay rise on average and robbing us of pensions. But this leak adds to it. We think the tipping point has now come. We did a consultative ballot at 45% turnout of which 98% voted for a 10% pay rise and 82% said they’d go on strike for it.” He said the civil service in reality needed thousands more in resources at a time when staff were struggling with backlogs of passports, driving licences, court cases, and pension payments, which is “driven by chronic understaffing, and a recruitment crisis”. “Six weeks ago we were all outraged about P&O and now half a million civil servants have woken up to the media saying one in five jobs must go,” he added, referring to P&O Ferries’ recent sacking of 800 crew. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, which represents 19,000 senior civil servants, said it had been like a “kind of P&O: civil servants finding out about one in five jobs having to go via the Daily Mail”, adding that there was “exasperation with all of this in the civil service”. He said this programme of cuts felt even less thought-through than previous rounds of job losses during the years of austerity, with the 91,000 number “plucked out of thin air”. He added: “In 2016, it was the lowest point of the civil service since the second world war, ravaged by cuts and yet what they’ve done is added all this work to the civil service since in relation to Brexit and Covid.” Kevin Brandstatter, a national officer at the GMB, which represents large numbers of Ministry of Justice staff, said: “This is a complete bombshell for the civil service and it’s not clear yet where the axe will fall. But if the cuts hit GMB members in the Ministry of Justice it will have a massive impact on legal aid and everyone’s right to proper representation in a court of law. “If the government go down the outsourcing route, the numbers of employed civil servants might fall, but all this will do is fill the wallets of the senior executives and shareholders. Ultimately it will cost the taxpayer more.” Permanent secretaries wrote to their departments on Friday, with some expressing regret at the way the news of cuts had been conveyed. Jim Harra, the permanent secretary at HM Revenue and Customs, sent a message to staff saying: “I am sorry that you have learned this from the media rather than from me or civil service leaders.” Defending the plans, the minister for Brexit opportunities, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said it was not a return to austerity because 2016 levels were “reasonable”. Downing Street also did not rule out compulsory redundancies, though No 10 said it was hoped many of the cuts would come through “natural wastage”. Experts also questioned the prime minister’s claim the cuts would help with the cost of living. Richard Murphy, professor of accounting at Sheffield University, said: “Cutting employment does not cut the cost of living. It just makes the cost of living crisis very much worse for some, and for the rest of us it deprives us of the benefit of their spending – meaning we’re worse off too.” Johnson’s plan was also challenged by Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and former public accounts committee chair, who said it was a “telling sign of a government flat out of ideas”. “While the cost of living crisis rages on, you can put their plans for real reform on a cigarette paper. Our hollowed-out civil service is in dire need of more expertise, not less,” she said. Tony Wilson, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said ministers should reduce the number of civil service jobs created to cope with the pandemic, but the scale of the cuts was “fanciful and damaging to the ability of the civil service to develop policy”. Two-thirds of all Whitehall employees worked in the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence, HMRC, the Home Office and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), he said. He added: “If the government wants to deny the Ministry of Defence some of the 50,000 civilians who support the work of the armed forces, cut the number of tax collectors employed by HMRC, reduce the Home Office’s Border Force and hit the courts system with yet more cuts, it should go ahead. “The cuts would also damage the DWP’s ability to find people made redundant new jobs, including civil servants put out of work by the new plan.” Jonathan Portes, an economist at King’s College London, said: “The cheapest and least painful way to reduce numbers is a hiring freeze – but that is also a recipe for inefficiency and poor resource allocation, with too many people in some areas and not enough in others, often meaning higher consultancy bills. Redundancies, on the other hand, cost money and reduce morale.”",News/Politics,"Civil service union warns of strike over Boris Johnson’s plan to cut 91,000 jobs",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/13/civil-service-pcs-union-warns-of-strike-over-pms-plan-to-cut-91000-jobs-boris-johnson
5/14/2022,"Six short years ago, Iga Swiatek arrived on the clay courts of Budapest for the Junior Fed Cup and in her first match she stared down the court at a Canadian opponent called Bianca Andreescu. As she won in three tough sets, it would be one of the formative results of Swiatek’s junior career, a win that imbued her with the belief that she could take on players from the bigger, more famous tennis nations. She finished the week by leading Poland to the title. It has been a long journey for both players since, and in the quarter-finals of the Italian Open, their paths finally crossed in singles competition for a second time, now as grand slam champions who have watched each other from afar with immense mutual respect. This matchup may one day stand as a defining rivalry of the era, but for now this is Swiatek’s time. After a bruising opening set, Swiatek efficiently separated herself as she breezed to an incredible 26th consecutive victory, defeating Andreescu 7-6(2), 6-0. “I feel like every match I’m playing better and better,” Swiatek said. “Even though the first set was pretty tight, I had some ups and downs, I feel like I could play well in important moments and break back anytime.” The opening set was tense, filled with high-octane exchanges as both players tried to smother the other’s second serve while looking to control the baseline. From early on, Swiatek challenged Andreescu to keep up with her intensity, athleticism and ball-striking. She established a 5-3 lead thanks to her superior movement, her backhand reeling off down-the-line winners and by cleaning up all short balls. Although still adjusting to such intensity so soon into her return, Andreescu slowly grew into the match and she fought desperately. She played her clearest spell of attacking tennis with her back to the wall, breaking Swiatek as she served for the set and then holding a break point at 5-5. But Swiatek’s confidence is stratospheric and she was present for all of the big points, arresting Andreescu’s momentum and then playing a flawless tie-break. Like in so many of her recent matches, Swiatek opened her shoulders and relaxed in the second set, the match swiftly falling away like so many of the 25 before them. With 26 consecutive wins, this incredible run now moves Swiatek level with Victoria Azarenka’s 2012 winning streak and in the 21st century, only the three greatest players of this period have compiled more wins: Venus Williams (35), Serena Williams (34) and Justine Henin (32). Swiatek has also won 40 of her last 41 sets and this year alone she has inflicted 13 bagel (6-0) sets on her opponents. “I needed time to learn how to do that properly, how to use the streak or ranking to put pressure on my opponents,” said Swiatek, who plays Aryna Sabalenka next. “I feel like I’ve done that pretty well last season and this season at the beginning, just learning how to use it in a positive way. Last year when I had better ranking, it felt like it’s something that’s pressuring me down. This time it’s totally different.” Even though Andreescu was unable to keep up, this has been another extremely positive week as she recovers her level and ranking after a six-month mental-health layoff. She has put herself in a good position for a deep run in Paris with the right draw and anticipation for the next meeting between herself and Swiatek has only grown. In the men’s draw, Stefanos Tsitsipas defeated Jannik Sinner 7-6(5), 6-2 to set up another meeting with his bitter rival Alexander Zverev, their third consecutive Masters 1000 semi-final match of the clay season. “For me, I have respect for him,” said Tsitsipas. “I don’t know if I’ve shown it or not, but I do have respect for what he has achieved in the sport so far. Every time I go out there to play him, I really want to bring out the best out of my game and really show what I’m capable of in terms of my tennis, handling the difficult situations.”",Sport/Sport,Iga Swiatek beats Bianca Andreescu to reach Italian Open semi-finals,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/13/iga-swiatek-beats-bianca-andreescu-to-reach-italian-open-semi-finals
5/14/2022,"The shooting of Al Jazeera’s Shireen Abu Aqleh – one of the Arab world’s best-known journalists – is not only a sad and devastating blow to friends and admirers, but a deadly reminder that press freedoms in the Holy Land are under attack. Abu Aqleh was among a group of journalists covering a raid by the Israel Defense Forces in the West Bank city of Jenin on Wednesday when, according to the reporters present, soldiers shot her in the head. She and her producer (who was shot in the back) were wearing vests marked with the word “press”. Her Qatar-based employer accused Israeli soldiers of shooting Abu Aqleh “in cold blood”. Israel’s response was a familiar one: claim the shooter was a Palestinian. This approach was largely abandoned when the army’s evidence was debunked. Israel now says its troops may have “accidentally” shot her. But public arguments over ballistics suggest Israel thinks guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt – or blame for the killing cannot be assigned. The argument, however, is not being played out in a court of law but in the court of public opinion. The EU and the US – Abu Aqleh was an American citizen – called for a probe. Disgracefully, the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, did not. There should be an investigation. Whoever shot Abu Aqleh ought to be held accountable. But the Israeli army investigating itself will not have the trust of Palestinians, or the wider world. At least 47 journalists have been killed by Israeli forces since 2000. Palestinians are particularly vulnerable, too often treated not as impartial observers but as partisans – rarely receiving official accreditation, having their movements restricted and being assaulted with impunity. No one has been held to account in Israel for media deaths. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, wants to go to the international criminal court over Abu Aqleh’s death. Prior to her killing, the International Federation of Journalists had already submitted claims to the court that Israel’s targeting of the media amounted to war crimes. Last May, Israel bombed the Gaza City media building – home to Palestinian networks and the Associated Press – claiming (without offering evidence) that it was being used by Hamas. The Israel-Palestine conflict is simmering and threatens to boil over. Since the current Israeli government took office last June, Israeli forces have killed 76 Palestinians, including at least 13 children, in the occupied territories. It is a concern when international law is disregarded in Israel. Mass expulsion and the demolition of Palestinian villages have been greenlit. Illegal settlements on occupied land are being expanded. Israel is seeing its worst wave of terror attacks in years; a spate of knife, gun and axe assaults have left 18 Israelis dead. This Sunday marks Nakba Day, when Palestinians mourn the loss of their homeland to a newborn Israel. Temperatures ought to be lowered. But Israeli authorities raised them.
