3/15/2022,"“Destruction of the Steamboat Sultana” by Gene Eric Salecker (Naval Institute Press) Nearly 1,200 people perished when the steamship Sultana exploded and burned in the early morning hours of April 27, 1865, in the Mississippi River. It's the worst maritime disaster in United States history, yet it's not as well known as other doomed ships such as the Titanic or the Lusitania. In “Destruction of the Steamboat Sultana,"" Gene Eric Salecker offers a comprehensive and at times compelling account of the disaster. The book is the second written on the Sultana by Salecker, a retired police officer and teacher who is a consultant for the Sultana Disaster Museum in Marion, Arkansas. The Sultana's sinking occurred in one of the most momentous months in the nation's history, just days after President Abraham Lincoln's assassination and the end of the Civil War. Most of the passengers on the overcrowded ship were Union soldiers who had been held as prisoners of war, finally on their way home after being in captivity. Not surprisingly, the most gripping sections of Salecker's book are descriptions of the ship's destruction and its aftermath. Salecker deftly lets the accounts of the survivors, rescuers and witnesses speak for themselves. These accounts leave readers with haunting images that will stay with them. Though not as dramatic as the descriptions of the disaster itself, Salecker's book also takes a detailed look at the mechanical causes as well as the human factors that contributed to so many perishing. He further debunks already disproven yet persistent conspiracy theories that the explosion was caused by Confederate saboteurs. The book is a must-read for Civil War buffs and those wanting to learn new details about the Sultana. Though it's a challenging read at times for those not familiar with the event, Salecker's account is a solid introduction to an oft-overlooked piece of history.",U.S./Associated Press,Review: 'Sultana' revisits a little-known American disaster,https://news.yahoo.com/review-sultana-revisits-little-known-155400657.html
3/15/2022,"BEIJING (Reuters) -Mainland China reported 1,807 new local symptomatic COVID-19 cases on Sunday, the highest daily figure in two years and more than triple the caseload of the previous day, as surging infections in a northeastern province squeeze health resources. The number of domestically transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms reported for Saturday spiked from 476 the previous day, data from the National Health Commission showed on Sunday. The daily count included 114 people initially classified as asymptomatic who later developed symptoms. China's case count is far lower than those of many other countries, but the growing number could complicate Beijing's ""dynamic-clearance"" ambition to suppress contagion as quickly as possible. The surge prompted health authorities to allow the public to buy rapid self-test kits for the first time to help detect infections quickly, as some experts said China's earlier strategy based on nucleic acid test - requiring medical workers to take samples - had become harder with the fast-spreading Omicron variant. The northeastern province of Jilin reported 1,412 new local symptomatic cases on Saturday, accounting for 78% of the national total and up from 134 a day earlier. The increase ""showed that some local areas, facing a rapid rise of the epidemic, lacked the capacity to expand medical resources, resulting in limited admission of infections to centralized facilities within a short period of time,"" a Jilin provincial official told a news briefing. Authorities in Changchun, the provincial capital already under lockdown, have been conducting mass testing and working on turning an exhibition centre into a temporary hospital with 1,500 beds, according to the local official and state media reports. The southern tech hub of Shenzhen reported 60 new local cases with confirmed symptoms for Saturday, the city's highest since China contained the first outbreak in early 2020. Shenzhen will suspend public transport including buses and subways from Monday, and residents have been told not to leave the city unless necessary, as the city conducts three rounds of mass testing, the authorities said in a statement. All nine districts in Shenzhen have halted dining in restaurants, closed indoor entertainment venues and demanded that companies should have employees work from home this Monday to Friday if remote working is possible, with exceptions for those in essential sectors. Six officials with local government or Communist Party authorities in the southern city of Dongguan have been removed from their roles for doing a poor job in COVID prevention and control, state media said on Sunday. The China Development Forum, a high-level business gathering in Beijing that was originally scheduled for March 19 to 22, will be postponed indefinitely due to the COVID situation, the organiser said in a statement. The number of new locally transmitted asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, rose to 1,315 on Saturday from 1,048 a day earlier, the fourth consecutive day of increases, the NHC data showed. There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636. As of March 12, mainland China had reported 115,466 cases with confirmed symptoms, including both local ones and those arriving from outside mainland.

3/15/2022,"Roman Abramovich's private jet flew from Israel to Istanbul on Monday, flight tracking data indicates. The UK froze the Chelsea FC owner's assets last week as part of sanctions against Russian oligarchs. Abramovich has citizenship in Israel, where planes owned by other oligarchs have landed. A private jet said to be owned by the sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich flew from Moscow to Israel to Istanbul on Monday, according to multiple reports. Data from flight-tracking website Flightradar24 showed Abramovich's plane make the short trip from Tel Aviv across the Mediterranean Sea earlier on Monday. Reuters reported that the jet left from Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport. Monday's flight to Turkey comes a day after the Gulfstream G650ER jet with the registration LX-RAY took off from Moscow on Sunday afternoon and landed in Tel Aviv in the evening, data from Flightradar24 indicates. The flight to Istanbul lasted a little under two hours, while the flight to Tel Aviv lasted 5 1/2 hours, the Flightradar24 data shows. It's unclear whether Abramovich was onboard. The jet had previously flown to Moscow from Istanbul on Saturday, the Flightradar24 data indicates. Various reports have identified Abramovich as the owner of the plane. A Twitter user who made headlines tracking Elon Musk's jet and now tracks the whereabouts of jets owned by Russian billionaires has also identified Abramovich as the jet's owner. Gulfstream says its G650ER jet can seat up to 19 passengers and sleep up to 10 people. A private-jet comparison site suggests it costs $65 million. Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, was among the seven Russian oligarchs the UK sanctioned on Thursday. The sanctions include freezing the oligarchs' assets and barring them from doing business with the country. Abramovich has an estimated net worth of $13.6 billion, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. He announced earlier this month that he would sell Chelsea FC, but the UK's sanctions mean he can't go ahead with the sale. The billionaire was reportedly granted Israeli citizenship in 2018 after facing delays in renewing his UK visa. Over the past two weeks, at least 14 private jets from Russia are said to have landed in Israel, whose government has not sanctioned any Russian oligarchs, The Times of Israel reported.
