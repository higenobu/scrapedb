1/10/2022,"(Reuters) - Police in Los Angeles, California, pulled the pilot from a crash-landed Cessna seconds before the aircraft was hit by a train on Sunday, sending debris flying in all directions. Dramatic video obtained by Reuters shows several officers freeing the man from the downed plane, which had crashed shortly after takeoff in the Pacoima neighborhood, according to local media. The officers and pilot are just a few feet away from the tracks when the passing train destroys the plane. ""The plane had a failed takeoff and landed on the train tracks at a popular intersection,"" said Luis Jimenez, the 21-year-old music composer who filmed the video. ""Just seconds before impact police officers saved the pilot, and a piece of debris almost hit me."" The pilot was treated for cuts and bruises and is in a stable condition, according to local media. No one on the train was injured, local media reported. Video footage posted on Twitter https://twitter.com/LAPDHQ/status/1480363436311670784 by the Los Angeles Police Department showed bodycam footage of officers pulling the bleeding pilot from the plane. The department applauded its officers, saying in the tweet they had ""displayed heroism and quick action by saving the life of a pilot who made an emergency landing on the railroad tracks.""

1/10/2022,"Former President Donald Trump received a dose of truth from an unexpected place on Sunday: Fox News. “In life, you have to learn to lose,” the network’s Brian Kilmeade told “Media Buzz” host Howie Kurtz when asked about Trump’s complaints of the 2020 election. “Hillary Clinton has to learn that,” Kilmeade added. “Al Gore pretty much did learn that. Stacey Abrams didn’t learn that.” Later in the segment, Kurtz noted that Clinton did concede her election loss, something Trump has yet to do. Kilmeade, one of the hosts of “Fox & Friends,” also bluntly dismissed Trump’s cries of election fraud, telling him to put up or shut up. “If you did, in fact, get screwed out of this election, put together an A-team list of lawyers ― not the ones we witnessed ― and show us the districts and show us how,” Kilmeade said. “I have not seen any of that.” See their full conversation below: Brian @Kilmeade says Jan. 6 was ""the worst day in Republican history,"" but that even if Trump ""did in fact get screwed out of this election,” he needs to show us the proof and it isn't helping him or the country to keep talking about it #Mediabuzzhttps://t.co/olW3e0wxw8 — #MediaBuzz (@MediaBuzzFNC) January 9, 2022 This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",Politics/HuffPost,Fox News Host Has Some Blunt Talk For Trump: 'You Have To Learn To Lose',https://news.yahoo.com/fox-news-host-blunt-talk-060112925.html
1/10/2022,"Rioters stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an attempt to overturn the presidential election. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson condemned the events of January 6 but did not call it an insurrection. January 6 was an ""interference with the lawful transfer of power using violence,"" the governor said. During a Sunday interview with Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson was reluctant to label the January 6 attack on the Capitol an insurrection, yet described it as one by definition. ""Some people are going to call it an insurrection. Some people are going to call it terrorism. I call it interference with the lawful transfer of power using violence, and that's wrong,"" Hutchinson said. The Republican governor paraphrased the definition for insurrection provided by dictionary publisher Merriam Webster: a usually violent attempt to revolt against or take control of a civil authority or established government. On January 6, violent protesters attempted to enter the Senate chamber, forcing US lawmakers to evacuate and abandon the task at hand: certifying President-elect Joe Biden's 2020 election win. While members of Congress were eventually able to return and finish the certification, it took authorities several hours to regain control of the Capitol building, which resulted in multiple deaths. Despite his indecisiveness on how to label the events of January 6, Hutchinson told Tapper that what happened should not be minimized. ""Let's accept what it is. Let's don't run from it. Let's learn from it and let's make sure that we don't fall down that path again. For the long term, we have to show to the world that we're not going to accept that as how we transfer power in elections in America,"" Hutchinson said.

1/10/2022,"""I rang up the county council and I said I think I've found a dinosaur,"" explained Joe Davis, who works at Rutland Nature Reserve near Leicester. During landscaping work at the reserve's reservoir in February 2021, he'd spotted something unusual poking out of the mud. It wasn't a dinosaur. But it was the fossilised remains of a ten-metre long sea predator called an ichthyosaur. And it was the largest of its type ever discovered in the UK. ""I looked down at what seemed like stones or ridges in the mud and I said this looks a bit organic, a bit different,"" Mr Davis told BBC News. ""Then we saw something that looked almost like a jawbone."" The council said to Mr Davis: ""We don't have a dinosaur department at Rutland County Council so we're going to have to get someone to call you back."" A team of paleontologists were brought in for a closer look. They concluded it was an ichthyosaurs - they were warm-blooded, air-breathing sea predators not unlike dolphins, and could grow up to 25 metres long. They lived between 250 million and 90 million years ago. Dr Dean Lomax, a palaeontologist from Manchester University, was brought in to lead the excavation effort. He called the discovery ""truly unprecedented"" and - due to its size and completeness - ""one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history"". ""Usually we think of ichthyosaurs and other marine reptiles being discovered along the Jurassic coast in Dorset or the Yorkshire coast, where many of them are exposed by the erosion of the cliffs. Here at an inland location is very unusual."" Rutland is more than thirty miles from the coast, but 200 million years ago higher sea levels meant it was covered by a shallow ocean. When water levels at the Rutland reservoir were lowered again in the late summer of 2021, a team of palaeontologists came in to excavate the remains. Special attention was paid to the removal of the huge skull. A large block of clay containing the ichthyosaur's head was carefully dug out before being covered in plaster and placed on wooden splints. The block, weighing almost a tonne, was raised out of the mud and will now be examined further. ""It's not often you are responsible for safely lifting a very important but very fragile fossil weighing that much,"" said Nigel Larkin, palaeontological conservator and Visiting Research Fellow at Reading University. ""It is a responsibility, but I love a challenge."" Anglia Water, which manages the Rutland reservoir, is now looking for funding to enable the ichthyosaur to stay in the area and be enjoyed by the general public. ""A lot of people thought I was pulling their leg when I told them I'd found a large marine reptile at work,"" Mr Davis said. ""I think a lot of people won't believe it until the TV programme goes out."" That TV programme is on Tuesday 11 January at 8pm on BBC Two. ""Digging for Britain"" will then be available on the BBC iPlayer.",Science/BBC,Huge fossilised ‘sea dragon’ found in Rutland reservoir,https://news.yahoo.com/huge-fossilised-sea-dragon-found-060118433.html
