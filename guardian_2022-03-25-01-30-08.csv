3/25/2022,"The Spanish government is meeting transport associations in a fresh attempt to end an enduring lorry strike over high fuel prices that has disrupted restaurant menus and led to food shortages in supermarkets. The action, which began last week, comes as surging energy costs are exacerbated by Russian’s invasion of Ukraine and consumer prices rise to their highest level in more than three decades. Drivers and lorry owners belonging to the Platform for the Defence of Transport have been blocking roads and ports, and conducting noisy go-slow protests to draw attention to their demands. Spain’s transport minister, Raquel Sánchez, said the government was addressing the problem and would seek “a clear and concrete solution” in Thursday’s meeting. Transport associations rejected the €500m (£417m) aid package the government offered on Monday, and the effects of the strike are already being felt by consumers. Hostelería España, an association representing more than 315,000 bars and restaurants across Spain, said its members were experiencing differing levels of shortages. “It varies from neighbourhood to neighbourhood and region to region, but we’re seeing supply problems when it comes to fresh fish and vegetables such as tomatoes and lettuce,” the association’s president, José Luis Yzuel Sanz, said. “In some regions, people are having to do a lot of juggling to put together their menú del día because a lot of the products just aren’t getting to them. “We hope it’s a temporary problem that will be over soon. If it doesn’t get fixed, it’s going to be very serious.” The multi-national food company Danone said on Tuesday that it could be forced to cease production and halt distribution, and the pasta firm Gallo has said the strike and the attendant difficulties in getting stock out of warehouses may oblige it to bring “a temporary halt to production activity”. The AECOC, one of Spain’s largest manufacturing and distribution associations, has said the situation could result in the need for furlough schemes. “As the strike stretches on, it’s clear that there will be no choice but to use this tool,” the head of the AECOC, Jose María Bonmati, told a press conference on Wednesday.",News/World news,Spain tries again to end 10-day lorry strike over high fuel prices,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/spain-tries-again-to-end-10-day-lorry-strike-over-high-fuel-prices
3/25/2022,"Billionaires are not usually happy to play second fiddle, but Eugene Shvidler has for decades operated under the shadow of his more famous (not to mention richer) business partner, Roman Abramovich. That close association has now caught up with him, with Shvidler added to the UK’s sanctions list on Thursday as part of the response to Russia’s war on Ukraine. The UK government said Shvidler, whose fortune is valued at $1.6bn by Forbes, was a “longstanding business partner” of Abramovich, and that through his shares in the oligarch’s Evraz metals and mining business, he had “been involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia”. Shvidler had two weeks’ notice that he could be in the government’s sights, after he was named in Abramovich’s designation for sanctions on 10 March. A day earlier, the UK impounded a Bombardier Global 6500 private jet thought to be linked to Shvidler because of suspected ties to Russia. The UK is uniquely placed to target Russia’s oligarchs, given their attraction to trophy properties in “Londongrad” and the home counties. Like several others on the sanctions lists, Shvidler is the owner of a Surrey mansion beside the exclusive St George’s Hill estate, and he is thought to have sold another £22m property in Belgravia, central London. Yet Shvidler also has an unusual distinction among the oligarchs hit by sanctions: he claims to be a citizen of the US and UK since 1994 and 2010 respectively and never to have held a Russian passport. His homeland was called the USSR when Shvidler was born in 1964 to mathematician parents in Ufa, 700 miles east of Moscow. He grew up and studied engineering and applied mathematics in the capital. “I grew up with communism, and if you live through communism you don’t love it,” he told the Observer in 2009, over a duck foie-gras lunch at his French vineyard. Shvidler briefly left for the US to study business at Fordham University, before rejoining his childhood friend Abramovich in the oil-trading business. Their timing proved fortuitous, with huge sums made by businesspeople in allegedly underpriced privatisations of some of Russia’s most valuable mineral wealth. The company that made the fortunes of Abramovich and Shvidler was Sibneft, one of Russia’s most valuable oil producers. Shvidler served as its president between 1998 and 2005. Since then their business interests have remained closely intertwined. In 2005, the Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom paid $13bn for 73% of Sibneft, to companies controlled by Millhouse Capital, a management company that Abramovich used to manage his financial interests. Shvidler is chair of another Millhouse company. Abramovich is a large shareholder in the London-listed steel company Evraz; Shvidler served on its board until sanctions were imposed on Abramovich and trading was suspended this month. Abramovich bought Chelsea football club in 2003; Shvidler briefly served as a director of the club. A spokesperson for Shvidler declined to comment on his addition to the UK list. Before the sanctions, Shvidler’s spokesperson said he “is not a public person and is not party to the current events”. He added: “Mr Shvidler would like to make it clear that, like the rest of us in Europe, he is hoping and praying for peace and an end to the senseless violence in Ukraine. We all hope that the war can be brought to an immediate end.”",News/World news,Eugene Shvidler: oligarch pays high price for close ties to Abramovich,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/eugene-shvidler-oligarch-abramovich-chelsea-russian-billionaire-uk-sanctions
3/25/2022,"It’s nearly nine years now since David Cameron was asked, at the height of austerity, the price of a loaf of bread. His immortal reply was that he didn’t really know as he made his own loaves in a breadmaker, preferably with fancy Cotswolds flour. Neither he nor George Osborne ever really recovered from Nadine Dorries calling them “two posh boys who don’t know the price of milk” so maybe that’s why, when Rishi Sunak was asked on breakfast television what he’d personally noticed about the soaring cost of living, his earnest answer was the price of bread. And that’s where things fell apart. What kind of bread did he buy, the presenter demanded? A Hovis seeded thing, said the chancellor, before confiding that due to varying levels of healthiness within the family (the Peloton-toned chancellor doesn’t look like a carbs man) they “all have different breads” in their house. Or perhaps, houses. The swimming pool and gym complex the Sunaks are building at their place in Yorkshire is the talk of the Westminster tearooms, which is presumably why when the SNP’s Treasury spokesperson Alison Thewliss raised the plight of families on pre-payment meters in parliament this week, she added snippily that you can’t get them for heated pools. It shouldn’t matter, of course, that the chancellor is loaded. It wouldn’t matter whether sourdough or brioche graced his own breakfast table if he’d just risen to the challenge of a moment where – according to the managing director of Iceland – food bank users are rejecting potatoes because they can’t afford the energy to cook them. But he didn’t, and now it’s just a question of how quickly he realises it. There’s an unfortunate pattern emerging to Sunak’s decision-making, as the former shadow Treasury aide James Meadway pointed out this week, and it’s one of initial underreaction followed by frantic running to catch up. Sunak came to parliament on Wednesday determined to clear up the mess left by the last guy, and equally determined not to mention that the last guy was Rishi Sunak. The national insurance hike to fund health and social care, that everyone warned Old Rishi would hurt low earners? New Rishi granted a reprieve. New Rishi’s spring statement boasted of introducing the biggest single personal tax cut in a decade, without acknowledging that this was only because Old Rishi had previously announced a record-breaking tax rise and was now reversing. The shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves’s best line was that this was the spring statement of a man essentially locked in argument with himself. He’d got it wrong in last autumn’s budget, then corrected himself, and will surely be back soon to correct the new mistakes made this week – primarily the baffling decision not to raise benefits in line with the soaring cost of living, but more broadly the failure to recognise that this was a moment for ripping up the rulebook. It’s not Sunak’s fault that as a relatively inexperienced chancellor he has now been hit by two impossible once-in-a-generation emergencies in two years, with the pandemic followed by a war in Europe pushing already high energy prices to stratospheric levels. There is no escaping the fact that both will leave us poorer, especially when coupled with Brexit (perhaps New Rishi could have a word with leave-voting Old Rishi about that one too). But unfortunately for people like the single mother who confronted him on an LBC phone-in, saying she’d had to turn the boiler off and the house was so cold she could see her breath indoors, he drew the wrong lesson from handling the pandemic. The right lesson should have been that, faced with an overwhelming but hopefully time-limited crunch, boldness saves money in the long term; that it’s cheaper and quicker, as well as kinder, to stop people falling into a giant economic hole than to dig them out later. Sunak took a while to be persuaded of the merits of a furlough scheme keeping people attached to their jobs but once he made the leap, was rightly praised for it. Furlough helped worried people sleep at night, but it also kept consumer confidence high enough to sustain the wider economy and almost certainly helped us bounce back faster after lockdown. Helping people cope with the sharpest forecast drop in living standards since records began in the 1950s, and possibly the worst since the 1920s, demanded a similar leap of imagination. Oil and gas prices won’t be this high for ever, because the war in Ukraine can’t (please God) last for ever and because, as Sunak himself rightly says, in a year or two we could have weaned ourselves off Russian fossil fuels. So if this is a big but relatively short-lived crisis, why not do something big but relatively short-lived to help? That something should have been heavily targeted at people with no way of paying rocketing fuel bills, but should also have nodded to those who can pay, but only by cutting out the kind of discretionary spending – taking the kids out for a treat, or those lunches from Pret that Boris Johnson was once so desperate for us all to return to a Covid-riddled office and buy – that keeps the economy afloat. Without that, we’re all at risk of sliding back towards a recession. But instead Sunak came up with an expensive nod to everyone, spread so thinly that it will barely be felt – 5p off a litre of fuel costs the Treasury a fortune but doesn’t even take pump prices back to where they were a fortnight ago – and virtually nothing for those in most need. As the Northern Echo’s front page headline crisply put it, Is That It? The government seems to have concluded post-pandemic that raising universal credit in a crisis only makes it more painful to take the money again afterwards, which is the only conceivable explanation for why the entire spring statement felt like a torturous exercise in dodging the most obvious way of helping the poorest people cope with rocketing inflation: just raise benefits in line with the cost of living, for heaven’s sake. But the outcome is so eye-poppingly at odds with what the times demand – the Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that the poorest fifth of families got £136 out of Sunak’s package, and the richest £475 – as to be baffling. All of which means New New Rishi will probably be back at the dispatch box before too long, earnestly undoing the mistakes the last guy made, but just that bit too late. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. But it’s no substitute for judgment.

3/25/2022,"The Duchess of Sussex will present a podcast investigating the stereotypes and labels that have held women back from the past to the present, ranging from physical weakness to promiscuity and hysteria, as the first series in the Sussexes multimillion-dollar deal with Spotify. The podcast, named Archetypes, will launch on the streaming service later this year after the deal was first announced in December 2020. Through conversations with historians and experts it will explore the origins of stereotypes and how they influence women’s lives. The trailer for the podcast starts with a series of quotes citing stereotypes that have held women back, including “She’s a slut”, “She’s emotionally unstable” and “People thought I should be quiet and submissive.” This is followed by Meghan saying: “This is how we talk about women: the words that raise our girls, and how the media reflects women back to us … but where do these stereotypes come from? And how do they keep showing up and defining our lives.” She then adds that the podcast will “dissect, explore and subvert the labels that try to hold women back” through conversations with “women who know all too well how these typecasts shape our narratives” and with historians explaining the background. The project is the first series to emerge from Archewell Audio, which was set up by Meghan and Prince Harry, and has an exclusive partnership with Spotify to produce programmes featuring a diverse range of perspectives. It will be produced in association with the award-winning podcasters Gimlet Media. The couple previously released a special in 2020 featuring their son, Archie, and celebrity guests. Meghan has previously indicated that women’s rights is an issue that is close to her heart, and pledged to continue her campaign work when she joined the royal family, which she has since left. She previously worked as UN Women’s advocate for women’s political participation and leadership, and has said she is “proud to be a feminist”.In 2018, she was praised for delivering a passionate speech about women’s suffrage in New Zealand in commemoration of the 125th anniversary of women achieving the right to vote in the country.",News/UK news,Meghan to host Spotify podcast on how stereotyping affects women’s lives,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/24/meghan-duchess-sussex-host-spotify-podcast-stereotyping-womens-lives
3/25/2022,"Rocketing global food prices as a result of the war in Ukraine could trigger riots from those going hungry in poor countries, the head of the World Trade Organization has said. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned food-producing countries against hoarding supplies and said it was vital to avoid a repeat of the Covid pandemic, when rich countries were able to secure for themselves the bulk of vaccines. In an interview with the Guardian, the WTO director general expressed concern about the knock-on effects of Russia’s invasion – stressing the dependence of many African countries on food supplies from the Black Sea region. “I think we should be very worried. The impact on food prices and hunger this year and next could be substantial. Food and energy are the two biggest items in the consumption baskets of poor people all over the world,” Okonjo-Iweala said. “It is poor countries and poor people within poor countries that will suffer the most.” Okonjo-Iweala, a former Nigerian finance minister, said 35 African countries were dependent on food imported from the Black Sea region, adding that Russia and Ukraine were responsible for 24% of global supplies of wheat. Agriculture has always been a vexed issue at the WTO, with continual rows about governments subsidising their own farmers while restricting access to their markets. “Discussions are pretty heated. They are always heated because these are huge issues,” she said. Okonjo-Iweala has just completed her first year as head of the WTO, having been appointed to provide some political impetus to an institution beset by disputes over how to liberalise trade and the mechanism for settling disputes. The WTO director general said progress was being made but admitted: “Since I got here things have been quite tough. It is not an easy job.” After being strongly critical of the “vaccine apartheid” that affected Africa during the pandemic, she said WTO member states had to resist the temptation of protecting their own food stocks. “It is a natural reaction to keep what you have – we saw that with vaccines. But we shouldn’t make the same mistake with food.” The WTO estimates 40% of the increase in global wheat prices during the food crisis of a decade ago was the result of hoarding. Only 12 countries currently have trade restrictions on food in place, Okonjo-Iweala said, including El Salvador, Cambodia and Egypt. “Other countries are trying to do things that are positive and we should learn from their best practice. “We must make sure we learn the lessons from vaccines and previous food crises. I am not sure we can fully mitigate the impact of the war in Ukraine because the numbers involved are huge, but we can mitigate some of it.” The WTO director-general said she was worried Ukraine’s planting season would be disrupted by the conflict and that supplies of fertiliser would also be limited. Ukraine typically provides half the wheat to the World Food Programme, the UN agency that provides emergency supplies to countries in conflict or experiencing natural disasters such as famines. “If we don’t think about how to mitigate the impact of the war that will be another catastrophe not just this year but next year,” she said. There was a danger of a repeat of the food riots that marked a previous period of rapidly rising prices in the late 2000s, she added. “We are talking to our members and urging them not to compound this crisis by having export restrictions on food.” Russia and Ukraine are among the 164 members of the WTO, a body founded on the idea that trade would lead to greater prosperity and peace. “This model has delivered for years and lifted people out of poverty” Okonjo-Iweala said. “The war doesn’t undermine the fact that trade can help build resilience and achieve peace.” Countries including the US, the UK, Canada and the 27 countries of the EU have imposed tariffs on Russia by removing its most-favoured country status, a WTO rule that means the same trade terms should be offered to all member states. Okonjo-Iweala said she could not envisage Russia being thrown out of the WTO because the process would be complicated, convoluted and require 75% of members to approve.",News/World news,"War in Ukraine could lead to food riots in poor countries, warns WTO boss",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/war-ukraine-food-riots-poor-countries-wto-ngozi-okonjo-iweala-food-prices-hunger
3/25/2022,"A jury has been shown video footage of the man accused of murdering the Conservative MP David Amess clutching a knife and being detained by unarmed police and later saying the offence he was arrested for was “terror” related. Ali Harbi Ali, 26, denies the murder of Amess, 69, as he held a constituency surgery in a church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, in October 2021. The jury at the Old Bailey were played footage from body-worn video cameras from the first two officers to arrive, who detained Ali. In it they plead with him to drop the knife, calling him “mate” and saying “please” as they confront a man they have been told will stab them. Ali, from north London, is alleged to have posed as a constituent to get a meeting with Amess, the MP for Southend West. Ali is alleged to have stabbed him 21 times, claiming it was revenge for western actions in Iraq and against Islamic State in Syria. An aide to Amess and a member of the public called police after Ali allegedly started his attack just after midday on 15 October 2021. First on the scene were PC Scott James and PC Ryan Curtis, who heard on their radio of a stabbing at the church. Both officers were in plainclothes and unarmed. Arriving at the scene, they had an extendable baton and PAVA spray, which can incapacitate a suspect. The footage shows them first waiting briefly outside the church, believing a unit armed with Taser was close by. They are told: “He’s stabbed David. The man is still inside the church and he is brandishing a knife, waving it around. He will stab you if you go in, he will stab you.” Then they go in, telling members of the public to stay back. The prosecution say that when the officers entered, Ali was speaking on the phone, it is believed to his sister. In his other hand he had a knife with a 20cm blade. Once they spotted Ali, it took officers just over 30 seconds to detain him. In the footage, the officers see Ali and shout “drop the knife” repeatedly. An officer shouts: “Listen to me, listen to me. It’s only going to go one way. Just drop that knife. Please drop that knife for me.” Also heard is an officer shouting: “You don’t want to do this.” Ali goes to ground, is told he is being arrested for murder and is read his rights while being handcuffed. He is told to stop moving and replies: “I’m not moving.” The jury were told earlier in the trial that Ali hoped the first officers on the scene would be armed and shoot him dead so he would be a martyr. In the footage, the suspect is taken to a police station where he gives his name. He helps the custody officer to spell the name of Amess, as she fills in paperwork. As Ali is being booked into custody, the person behind the desk asks whether the arrest was “domestic or hate-related”. Ali jumps in answering: “terror” before the officers who detained him can reply. Asked on what basis, Ali answers: “Religious”. Ali also denies preparing acts of terrorism. The jury heard that on a phone he was arrested with at the church were details of planning for a potential attack on the cabinet minister Michael Gove. The trial continues.",News/UK news,David Amess stabbing: jury shown video of unarmed police detaining accused,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/24/david-amess-stabbing-jury-shown-video-of-unarmed-police-detaining-accused
