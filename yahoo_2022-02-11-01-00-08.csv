2/11/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — A remote-controlled robot has captured images of what appears to be mounds of nuclear fuel that melted and fell to the bottom of the most damaged reactor at Japan’s wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant, officials said Thursday. A massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011 damaged cooling systems at the power plant, causing the meltdown of three reactor cores. Most of their highly radioactive fuel fell to the bottom of their containment vessels, making its removal extremely difficult. A previous attempt to send a small robot with cameras into the Unit 1 reactor failed, but images captured this week by a ROV-A robot show broken structures, pipes and mounds of what appears to be melted fuel and other debris submerged in cooling water, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings said Thursday. About 900 tons of melted nuclear fuel remain inside the plant’s three damaged reactors, including about 280 tons in Unit 1. Its removal is a daunting task that officials say will take 30-40 years. Critics say that’s overly optimistic. The robot, carrying several tiny cameras, obtained the internal images of the reactor's primary containment vessel while on a mission to establish a path for subsequent probes, TEPCO said. TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara said the piles of debris rose from the bottom of the container, including some inside the pedestal — a structure directly beneath the core — suggesting the mounds were melted fuel that fell in the area. Takahara said further probes will be needed to confirm the objects in the images. At one location, the robot measured a radiation level of 2 sievert, which is fatal for humans, Takahara said. The annual exposure limit for plant workers is set at 50 millisievert. The robot probe of the Unit 1 reactor began Tuesday and was the first since 2017, when an earlier robot failed to obtain any images of melted fuel because of the extremely high radiation and interior structural damage. The fuel at Unit 1 is submerged in highly radioactive water as deep as 2 meters (6.5 feet). TEPCO said it will conduct additional probes after analyzing the data and images collected by the first robot. Five other robots, co-developed by Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning, a government-funded consortium, will be used in the investigation over the next several months. The investigation at Unit 1 aims to measure the melted fuel mounds, map them in three dimensions, analyze isotopes and their radioactivity, and collect samples, TEPCO officials said. Those are key to developing equipment and a strategy for the safe and efficient removal of the melted fuel, allowing the reactor's eventual decommissioning. Details of how the highly radioactive material can be safely removed, stored and disposed of at the end of the cleanup have not been decided. TEPCO hopes to use a robotic arm later this year to remove an initial scoop of melted fuel from Unit 2, where internal robotic probes have made the most progress.",World/Associated Press,Robot photos appear to show melted fuel at Fukushima reactor,https://news.yahoo.com/robot-photos-appear-show-melted-134212334.html

2/11/2022,"Trump denies Maggie Haberman's report that he would clog toilets by trying to flush documents down them. Trump also says he was ""told I was under no obligation"" to promptly turn over his records, which isn't how the law works. There are now at least four reported ways Trump tried to destroy documents in the White House. Former President Donald Trump on Thursday denied reports that he flushed documents down a White House toilet and said he was told he was under ""no obligation"" to turn over his administration's records, a claim that flies in the face of presidential records law. ""Also, another fake story, that I flushed papers and documents down a White House toilet, is categorically untrue and simply made up by a reporter in order to get publicity for a mostly fictitious book,"" Trump said in a statement released by his Save America PAC after Axios reported on excerpts of New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman's upcoming book, ""Confidence Man."" Bloomberg White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs said Haberman's reporting about the documents in toilets is ""100% accurate"" and that sources at the time confirm that staff found torn up pieces of papers in toilets and thought that Trump was behind it. Trump has now faced days of questions and reports over his apparent flouting of the Presidential Records Act, which requires every White House to preserve memos, documents, and other memorabilia that is considered the property of the American people. ""In actuality, I have been told I was under no obligation to give this material based on various legal rulings that have been made over the years,"" Trump claimed in his statement. The National Archives, which collects, sorts through, and later releases presidential records, has asked the Justice Department to investigate if Trump broke the law when he took documents to Mar-a-Lago, The Washington Post reported. In another sign of the seriousness of the situation, The Times reports that officials found possible classified information in the documents Trump belatedly handed over. There are now at least four reported ways Trump sought to destroy documents while in the White House: He ripped them up (as Politico first reported in 2018). He ate them. He dropped them on the floor. And he flushed them down the toilet. Axios, citing Haberman's book, reports that ""staff in the White House residence periodically discovered wads of printed paper clogging a toilet — and believed the president had flushed pieces of paper."" Historians and experts have pointed out that the Presidential Records Act is relatively toothless in punishing those who fail to comply with it. But, as The Daily Beast reported, one federal law dealing with the mutilation or destruction of documents carries the possibility that Trump could be barred from ever holding office again.

2/11/2022,"Courtesy of University of Tübingen / Marcus Müller Archaeologists make new and incredible discoveries all of the time, but their latest finding gives us insight into the daily lives of ancient Egyptians, from their shopping lists to the type of schoolwork they did. According to a report by Smithsonian Magazine, researchers excavating the city of Athribis, an ancient settlement in lower Egypt, have discovered more than 18,000 pieces of inscribed pottery shards. The inked pottery pieces are known as ""ostraca,"" an affordable and more accessible alternative to papyrus. The remains of broken jars and other vessels were inscribed by dipping a reed or hollow stick in ink to detail receipts, record trades, lists of names, copy literature, and teach students how to write and draw. Related: Archaeologists Discovered an Ancient Ring That Was Once Used to Ward Off Hangovers A large number of the fragments appear to have originated from an ancient school. In fact, more than a hundred of the ostraca are covered in repetitive writing exercises, thought to be a form of punishment for students that misbehaved. ""There are lists of months, numbers, arithmetic problems, grammar exercises, and a 'bird alphabet'—each letter was assigned a bird whose name began with that letter,"" says Christian Leitz in a statement. Leitz is a professor at the University of Tübingen in Germany and led the excavations alongside Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. Nearly all (80 percent) of the pottery pieces are written in demotic, an administrative script used during the reign of Cleopatra's father, Ptolemy. Greek is the second-most common script, but hieroglyphics, Arabic and Coptic—a mix of Greek and Egyptian languages—also appear, hinting at the city's robust multicultural history. While Athribis has been at the forefront of various excavations for over 100 years, more rigorous research began in 2003, when the Athribis Project was launched. Discoveries have included multi-story buildings with staircases and vaults, but unearthing the inscribed pottery is one of the team's most notable findings. The University of Tübingen said it was ""very rare to find such a large volume"" of ostraca. A similarly sized collection has only been discovered once before.",Science/Martha Stewart Living,"Archaeologists Discovered 18,000 Ancient Egyptians Notepads, Which Include Shopping Lists and Schoolwork",https://news.yahoo.com/archaeologists-discovered-18-000-ancient-150927958.html
2/11/2022,"Pete Davidson is officially moving out of Staten Island! The Saturday Night Live star confirmed as much in an interview with NBCLX's Tabitha Lipkin, saying “Sorry I'm moving so my place is disgusting. I'm moving to Brooklyn. I am very excited. I love Staten Island, but it takes too long to get over the bridge."" This is a curious turn of events since an Us Weekly source had previously indicated that Pete was looking to move to California to be closer to Kim Kardashian, saying “Pete’s been spending more time in L.A. to be close to Kim, and he’s looking to find a place there. They’ve definitely gotten serious.” Hmmm. Anyway, before we move on plz not that Pete appears to have moved his Kim Kardashian candle into view before formally kicking off this interview: Which is of course noteworthy since elsewhere in the same day of press, People host Kay Adams asked Pete if she was correct in noticing that he had a Kim candle in the background, and he responded, “Yes, it is. That is. That is exactly what that is.” Anyway! TBD on how Staten Island, as an island, will take the news of Pete heading to Brooklyn, but the entire city of Syracuse is still upset about Pete calling them ""trash"" so he has a history of various locations in New York state taking things v personally. Though, to be fair, Pete did literally say ""Syracuse, you know, it’s trash. Worse than Staten Island. The nicest hotel in Syracuse is, like, a fucking Ramada.” Anyway, hope Pete enjoys Brooklyn!
