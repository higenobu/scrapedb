4/4/2022,"Ukraine's president condemned European leaders for their 2008 decision to not let Ukraine join NATO. Zelenskyy's comments followed shocking reports of mass casualties in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv. Germany and France shot down Ukraine's bid to join NATO during a summit in 2008. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited former German Chancellor Angela Merkel to look at the mass graves in Bucha, saying they were the result of her 2008 decision not to let Ukraine join NATO. Zelenskyy's comments came in a Sunday address to the nation after shocking reports and images emerged of mass civilian casualties in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv that was retaken by Ukrainian forces last week. In his speech, Zelenskyy accused Russia of ""genocide"" and singled out Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France, for their roles in a 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania. ""Under optimistic diplomatic statements that Ukraine could become a member of NATO, then, in 2008, refusal to accept Ukraine into the alliance was hidden. The absurd fear of some politicians toward Russia was hidden,"" Zelenskyy said. ""They thought that by refusing Ukraine, they would be able to appease Russia, to convince it to respect Ukraine and live normally next to us,"" he said. ""I invite Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy to visit Bucha and see what the policy of concessions to Russia has led to in 14 years. To see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women."" During the 2008 summit, NATO leaders discussed requests by Ukraine and Georgia to join the Membership Action Plan, which is required for any country that wants to qualify for NATO membership. While then-US President George W. Bush pressed for both countries to be given the MAP, Germany and France argued that such a step would increase friction with Russia, which had strongly opposed Ukraine's request. In the end, the alliance did not take any immediate action but pledged that Ukraine and Georgia would eventually become NATO members, according to an official summary of the talks. They reiterated this promise at another NATO summit in Brussels in July 2021. Russia has continued opposing NATO's eastward expansion, and cited it as a reason for invading Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. Last month Zelenskyy said he had accepted that his country could not join NATO at the moment, telling Western officials: ""It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of NATO. We understand this."" Ukraine also offered to never join NATO during peace negotiations with Russia last week.

4/4/2022,"The captain of a detained superyacht said its Russian owner was ""guilty by association of his passport only."" Guy Booth, captain of the Phi, told Stuff the yacht's owner wasn't an oligarch and hasn't been sanctioned. The $50 million Phi was detained in London by the UK government on Tuesday. The captain of a $50 million superyacht detained by the UK has hit out at ""blatant racism"" shown toward Russians who don't want to be linked to the Ukraine war. Guy Booth, captain of the 192-foot Phi, which has been linked to a Russian businessman, told New Zealand publication Stuff that the yacht's crew was ""100% British and always has been"" and they opposed Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Putin's actions. ""However, we do not condone the blatant racism shown towards those Russians that wish to not be associated with the conflict,"" Booth said. Booth said the owner of the Phi was ""guilty by association of his passport only,"" adding that they hadn't been sanctioned and had ""never been connected with anyone who is."" The West has been sanctioning Russian elites and seizing their assets to put pressure on the country to halt its invasion of Ukraine. Phi was detained by the UK on Tuesday in Canary Wharf, London's eastern financial district. The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) has declined to name Phi's owner, describing them only as a ""Russian businessman"" who had ""deliberately"" kept their ownership of the vessel secret. However, UK transport minister Grant Shapps referred to the yacht's owner as a ""Russian oligarch."" Booth told Stuff that the vessel's owner wasn't an oligarch and said that Shapps' use of the term ""puts all the crew at an unnecessary risk of harm from those that are angry about the war."" Some vessels owned by sanctioned oligarchs have been targeted by anti-war activists. A group of protesters in an inflatable dinghy reportedly tried to stop Roman Abramovich's $600 million superyacht Solaris from docking in Turkey. The Financial Times earlier reported Phi's owner as Vitaly Vasilievich Kochetkov, founder of Motiv Telecom. Kochetkov has not been sanctioned by the UK, and The FT reported that he didn't appear to be close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. On March 1, the UK banned all Russian-owned or operated ships from its ports and gave authorities the power to detain such vessels. Four weeks later, Phi became the ""first ever"" superyacht to be detained in UK waters, the National Crime Agency said. Officials told the yacht's staff that Phi had been detained ""on the grounds that it is owned, controlled, or operated by a person connected with Russia,"" Booth told Insider. Shapps said that by detaining Phi, authorities had ""turned an icon of Russia's power and wealth into a clear and stark warning to Putin and his cronies."" Booth has said previously that Phi's detention was ""government overreach and nothing more than a publicity stunt."" Phi has been moored in Canary Wharf since December after it made its maiden voyage there from the Netherlands. An NCA spokesperson told Insider that because the vessel ""isn't seized, merely detained,"" it remains the property and responsibility of the owner, but can't leave the dock. Booth told Insider that Phi Phantom, Phi's support ship, was inspected by Italian authorities on Thursday, who requested ""comprehensive documents"" before telling the vessel's staff that all appeared to be in order.

4/4/2022,"If mortgage rates continue on their current trajectory, some experts predict 30-year fixed rates could hit 5% within the next month or so. Whenever rates hit this benchmark, one thing is clear: Though a 5% mortgage rate is still considered historically low, it would signify the highest level for rates in about the last decade. “While rates got very close, reaching as high as 4.94% in November 2018, they did not reach 5%, according to data from Freddie Mac,” says Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.

4/4/2022,"BUCHA, Ukraine (AP) — Russia faced a fresh wave of condemnation on Monday after evidence emerged of what appeared to be deliberate killings of civilians in Ukraine. Some Western leaders called for further sanctions in response, even as Moscow continued to press its offensive in the country's east. Germany's defense minister suggested the European Union discuss a ban on Russian gas imports, but more senior officials indicated an immediate boycott was not possible — a sign that leaders could struggle in the short-term to ramp up already severe sanctions on Russia. Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians were found in towns around the capital, Kyiv, that were recaptured from Russian forces in recent days. In Bucha, northwest of the capital, Associated Press journalists saw 21 bodies. One group of nine, all in civilian clothes, were scattered around a site that residents said Russian troops used as a base. They appeared to have been shot at close range. At least two had their hands tied behind their backs. In Motyzhyn, to the west of Kyiv, AP journalists saw the bodies of four people who appeared to have been shot at close range and thrown into a pit. Residents said the mayor, her son, and her husband — who had been bound and blindfolded — were among them. The images of battered corpses lying in the streets or hastily dug graves unleashed a wave of outrage that could signal a turning point in the nearly 6-week-old war. But sanctions have thus far failed to halt the offensive, and rising energy prices along with tight controls on the Russian currency market have blunted their impact, with the ruble rebounding strongly after initially crashing. Western and Ukrainian leaders have accused Russia of war crimes before, and the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor has opened a probe to investigate the conflict. But the latest reports ratcheted up the condemnation even further, with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some Western leaders going so far as to accuse Russia of genocide. In a video shown during the Grammy Awards in Las Vegas for musicians and other artists, Zelenskyy implored them to support his nation and “fill the silence with your music.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov rejected the allegations, describing the scenes outside Kyiv as a “stage-managed anti-Russian provocation.” He said the mayor of Bucha made no mention of atrocities a day after Russian troops left last week, but two days later scores of bodies were photographed scattered in the streets. He said Russia is pushing for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the matter, but the U.K., which currently chairs the body, has refused to convene it. The United States and Britain have accused Russia in recent weeks of using Security Council meetings to spread disinformation. European leaders, meanwhile, left no doubt about who they thought was behind the killings. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said “the Russian authorities are responsible for these atrocities, committed while they had effective control of the area.” “The perpetrators of war crimes and other serious violations as well as the responsible government officials and military leaders will be held accountable,” he added. French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that there is “clear evidence of war crimes” in Bucha that demand new measures. “I’m in favor of a new round of sanctions and in particular on coal and petrol. We need to act,” he said on France-Inter radio. Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki described Russia as a “totalitarian-fascist state,"" saying “the bloody massacres perpetrated by Russian soldiers deserve to be called by name: This is genocide."" Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez also used the word “genocide,” saying those responsible should answer for their crimes. The crime of genocide is difficult to prove, as prosecutors would have to show that the killers or their commanders had a “specific intent” to partially or wholly destroy a group of people. In the meantime, the U.S. and its allies have sought to punish Russia for the invasion by imposing sweeping economic sanctions. But they may be reluctant to impose measures that cause further harm to a global economy still recovering from the coronavirus pandemic. As a major oil and gas exporter, Russia stands to benefit from any rise in already high global energy prices. Europe is in a particular bind, since it gets 40% of its gas and 25% of its oil from Russia. Governments have been scrambling to find ways to reduce that reliance without causing a substantial loss of economic output. German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, who is also the economy minister and responsible for energy, said Europe can go “significantly further” in imposing sanctions against Russia. But he said Germany is right to take a longer-term approach to abandoning Russian energy imports. Germany has faced criticism for opposing an immediate halt to Russian energy deliveries. The country says it hopes to end Russian coal imports this summer and oil imports by the end of the year, but halting gas will take longer. “We are working every day on creating the conditions for and steps toward an embargo,” Habeck said. ""We are on the right track.” Wolfgang Buechner, a German government spokesman, meanwhile said Putin and his supporters “will feel the consequences,” of additional measures to be approved in the coming days, without elaborating. Asked on ARD television Sunday evening whether there should be a halt to gas deliveries, German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht replied that “exactly that” should be discussed by EU ministers. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s Feb. 24 invasion  has killed thousands of people and forced more than 4 million Ukrainians to flee their country. Putin has said the attack is aimed at eliminating a security threat and demanded that Ukraine drop its bid to join the NATO military alliance of Western countries. Ukraine insists it never posed any threat but has offered to officially declare itself neutral. The head of Ukraine’s delegation in talks with Russia has said Moscow’s negotiators informally agreed to most of a draft proposal discussed during talks in Istanbul, but no written confirmation has been provided. While Western officials initially said they believed Putin's goal was to take Kyiv and potentially install a Kremlin-friendly government, Russian forces faced stiff resistance outside the capital and on other fronts, and have now retreated from some areas. Moscow says it is currently focusing its offensive on the Donbas in the country’s east, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for years. Britain’s Defense Ministry said Monday that Russia continued to flood soldiers and mercenaries from the Wagner private military group into the Donbas. It said Russian troops are still trying to take the region's strategic port city of Mariupol, which has seen weeks of heavy fighting and some of the worst suffering of the war. “Mariupol is almost certainly a key objective of the Russian invasion,"" the ministry said, ""as it will secure a land corridor from Russia to the occupied territory of Crimea,” in the south, which Moscow annexed in 2014. On Monday, the Ukrainian military said its forces had retaken some towns in the northern Chernihiv region and humanitarian aid was being delivered. ___ Qena reported from Motyzhyn, Ukraine.
