3/23/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - One of President Vladimir Putin's closest allies warned the United States on Wednesday that the world could spiral towards a nuclear dystopia if Washington pressed on with what the Kremlin casts as a long-term plot to destroy Russia. Dmitry Medvedev, who was president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, said the United States had conspired to destroy Russia as part of an ""primitive game"" since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. ""It means Russia must be humiliated, limited, shattered, divided and destroyed,"" Medvedev, 56, said in a 550-word statement. The views of Medvedev, once considered to be one of the least hawkish members of Putin's circle, gives an insight into the thinking within the Kremlin as Moscow faces in the biggest confrontation with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. The United States has repeatedly said that it does not want the collapse of Russia and that its own interests are best served by a prosperous, stable and open Russia. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside usual business hours. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced nearly 10 million and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Putin says the operation was necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the ""genocide"" of Russian speakers by Ukraine. Ukraine says Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. Medvedev said the Kremlin would never allow the destruction of Russia, but warned Washington that if it did achieve what he characterised as its destructive aims then the world could face a dystopian crisis that would end in a ""big nuclear explosion"". He also painted a picture of a post-Putin world that would follow the collapse of Russia, which has more nuclear warheads than any other country. The destruction of the world's biggest country by area, Medvedev said, could lead to an unstable leadership in Moscow ""with a maximum number of nuclear weapons aimed at targets in the United States and Europe."" Russia's collapse, he said, would lead to five or six nuclear armed states across the Eurasian landmass run by ""freaks, fanatics and radicals"". ""Is this a dystopia or some mad futuristic forecast? Is it Pulp fiction? No,"" Medvedev said.

3/23/2022,"Hillsong megachurch founder Brian Houston has resigned amid allegations of inappropriate behavior. Houston was the subject of two complaints, including a 2013 incident involving inappropriate texts sent to a staffer. The second incident involved a 2019 complaint regarding a hotel room encounter with an unnamed woman. Brian Houston, the founder of the Australia-based Hillsong megachurch and also one of its pastors, has resigned following the church's revelations that he behaved inappropriately with two women. ""We would like to advise you that Pastor Brian Houston has resigned as Global Senior Pastor of Hillsong Church and the board has accepted his resignation,"" said the church's board in a statement on Tuesday. In a separate statement on Friday, the Hillsong global board detailed the two incidents that resulted in complaints against Houston. Multiple news outlets have reported that both incidents involved women. The first incident in 2013 involved Houston sending inappropriate text messages to a staff member, which resulted in her resignation. ""At the time, Pastor Brian was under the influence of sleeping tablets, upon which he had developed a dependence. He immediately apologized to the person,"" the board wrote in its statement. During a global staff meeting held hours before the statement's release, the church's acting head Phil Dooley described Houston's text messages as essentially saying, ""If I was with you, I'd like to kiss and cuddle you,"" and other ""words of that nature,"" per ABC News. The second incident took place in 2019 and involved Houston becoming ""disoriented"" due to consuming an excessive dose of anti-anxiety medication along with alcohol. According to ABC News' coverage of the staff meeting, Dooley said Houston had been ""drinking with a group"" on one of the nights of a Hillsong conference in New South Wales. ""This resulted in him knocking on the door of a hotel room that was not his, entering this room and spending time with the female occupant,"" the board wrote in its statement, noting that Houston's actions had breached the church's code of conduct for pastors. During a staff meeting on Wednesday, Dooley said the church would be launching an ""independent review"" of its structure. Hillsong is known to be a megachurch that was at one point attended by celebrities like Chris Pratt, Justin Bieber, and Selena Gomez. It attracted controversy in 2020 when volunteers accused church leaders and pastors of elitism and exploitative behavior, racism, and anti-LGBTQ behavior. During his time at the church, Houston oversaw the firing of Pastor Carl Lentz in 2020 over the latter's ""moral failures"". Lentz, who was known for being Bieber's spiritual adviser, later revealed that he had cheated on his wife of 17 years. Houston also admitted in May 2021 that the church had a ""culture"" in which A-listers were given preferential treatment over other congregants. Separately, Houston has been accused by the Australian police of concealing the sexual abuse of a young boy. The case involved Houston's father allegedly confessing to him that he had sexually abused a seven-year-old boy. Houston has denied the charges.

3/23/2022,"The filmmaker Maxim Pozdorovkin said Donald Trump fit ""neatly"" into an anti-West Kremlin narrative. He said Trump was portrayed as the only US leader not ""trying to destroy the Russian way of life."" He described Russia as ""fully and artfully"" waging an information war for the past decade. A filmmaker who has extensively documented Russian propaganda said this week that of all the US leaders, former President Donald Trump fit ""neatly"" into the Kremlin's anti-West narrative. In an interview with The Washington Post, Maxim Pozdorovkin — whose award-winning documentary ""Our New President"" follows Trump's election in 2016 as depicted by Russia's state-linked media — gave his take on Moscow's long-standing propaganda campaign against the US and the West. Pozdorovkin told The Post that in the decade leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russians had been fed the same message ""over and over"" by President Vladimir Putin's government that the West was constantly attempting to ""stifle and destroy"" their society. He said Trump ""fits neatly"" in Moscow's propaganda efforts because he could be portrayed as the ""one American leader who wasn't trying to destroy the Russian way of life."" In the context of that narrative, Pozdorovkin said, the domestic backlash that Trump faced in the US — no matter the real reason — could be framed as being fueled by anti-Russia interests. ""It's been an information war — a totally one-sided information war — and it has been waged so fully and artfully that it's made a lot of what's happening now preemptively possible,"" he told the outlet. ""The Russian media has been totally shadowboxing for years; no one was fighting back,"" he said later in the interview. ""But that doesn't really matter. If you ingrain this message of victimhood so completely, what it does is when there's any kind of Putin aggressive action, as there is now, a lot of people in Russia don't see it as aggressive. ""They just see it as standing up for their way of life."" Trump and Putin met five times during Trump's presidency, though details of these meetings were handled secretively, as The New York Times reported in 2019. Trump's dealings with Russia and apparent openness toward Russian help during his 2016 presidential campaign attracted wide scrutiny during much of his presidency. Amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Trump has made several statements about Putin and Russia. Most recently, Trump said if he were still president, he would send nuclear submarines to go ""up and down"" Russia's coast to pressure Putin. He has also suggested in a speech to Republican donors that the US put Chinese flags on its fighter jets to ""bomb the shit out of Russia."" Soon before the invasion, Trump praised Putin's justification for sending his forces into Ukraine, calling the Russian leader ""savvy,"" ""smart,"" and a ""genius.""

3/23/2022,"It took one look for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to put Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) firmly in his place. After answering questions for hours from the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, the Supreme Court nominee gave a withering look to Cruz when he sought to cast doubt on her membership on the board of a liberal private school that proudly promotes “social justice.” The conservative senator tried to paint fellow Harvard Law alum, Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as a proponent of so-called critical race theory because Georgetown Day School had placed books including “How To Be an Anti-Racist” in its curriculum. Jackson, who would become the first Black woman to ever serve on the nation’s top court, took a long measured pause before answering. “Senator, I do not believe that any child should be made to think that any child is racist or less than,” Jackson said. The poised jurist looked incredulously over her glasses as Cruz claimed that another book was inappropriate for recommended summer reading because it suggested that America is not a color-blind society. “This book says the exact opposite of what Dr. King spoke about,” blustered Cruz. “Are you comfortable with these ideas being taught to children?” Jackson wasted little time shutting down his argument, which echoes GOP campaign complaints against white kids being taught about the history of racism. “Senator, I have not reviewed any of those books,” she said matter-of-factly. “They don’t come up in my work as a judge, which respectfully, I am here to address.” Cruz quickly backed down, returning to other lines of attack, like criticism that she gave sentences that were too lenient to sex offenders.",Politics/NY Daily News,Supreme Court Judge nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson shuts down Sen.

3/23/2022,"Local governments in Florida rarely declare states of emergencies. Miami Beach, using the standard of “clear and present danger of a riot or other general public disorder,” has previously employed such declarations for hurricanes, a global pandemic and the catastrophic collapse of a condo tower in neighboring Surfside. So the decision to elevate spring break crowd control into a community emergency has earned quick backlash from critics who charged that city leaders are overreacting, again, to large — mostly Black — crowds that have mostly been peaceful so far during this year’s gathering. “The only emergency is that Black people are on the Beach,” said Stephen Hunter Johnson, a member of Miami-Dade’s Black Advisory Board, adding: “I don’t understand how this town has been doing spring break for at least 25 years and can’t figure it out.” Michael Grieco, a state lawmaker and former Miami Beach commissioner, also said the step was heavy-handed: “The state of emergency is an abuse of governmental power, and it scares the crap out of me.” Spurred by two shootings that injured five people, Miami Beach announced this week that it would institute a state of emergency and a 12 a.m. curfew to curtail crowds on South Beach. The exact details of what powers Miami Beach plans to flex remain unclear — the government has yet to release a copy of the state of emergency order, which must be signed by City Manager Alina Hudak. So far, officials say the city will implement a midnight to 6 a.m. curfew, for areas between South Pointe Drive and 23rd Street, and set up traffic barricades to deter non-residents from entering some neighborhoods. After 2 shootings, spring break gets curfew and state of emergency in South Beach City officials on Monday said the state of emergency was necessary because of the two shootings over two nights. “There are cowards out there toting guns,” Hudak said during Monday’s press conference. Miami Beach commissioners, during Tuesday’s commission meeting, voiced support for extending the curfew through at least Monday. “It’s literally by the grace of God that we haven’t had a tragedy in our city. I can’t think of a more fitting public safety emergency than this one,” Commissioner Steven Meiner said. Initially, Miami Beach’s police chief said officers would set up a checkpoint entering South Beach to turn away non-residents or people who weren’t staying in the city. But with the city determining that checkpoints might not be legal, Chief Richard Clements backed away from that plan on Tuesday, saying officers will instead tell crowds to leave or go back to their hotels. The declaration is but the latest escalation in the city’s larger campaign to tamp down the partying that for years has defined South Beach’s nightlife. Last year during spring break, with a state of emergency in effect because of the COVID-19 pandemic, rowdy crowds vandalized property, jumped on police cars and blocked streets to party. That later spurred the Miami Beach City Commission to pass a controversial law that gave cops greater power to arrest people who get too close to them, a law that is now the subject of litigation over its constitutionality after it was used to arrest mostly Black people filming officers. As part of its tough-on-crime approach, the commission has also expanded its municipal prosecution program. And, in its most visible effort, Miami Beach has sought to curtail booze in the entertainment district. In the past year, in a lawsuit brought by the famed Clevelander hotel, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Beatrice Butchko has twice struck down temporary bans on liquor sale after 2 a.m. Grieco, the former commissioner, described the optics of the state of emergency order and curfew as “terrible.” “It can be interpreted as a way to do an end-around on the recent order by Judge Butchko,” Grieco said. This month’s crowds — and racial tensions between residents and mostly Black visitors — are nothing new. Since the early 2000s, mostly Black crowds have flocked to South Beach for hip-hop events during the holiday Memorial Day, leading to criticism of heavy-handed police tactics. But even then, city officials never instituted a state of emergency. And this year, officials vowed to take a softer approach, hiring social-media influencers and instituting a concert series that included acts such as Juanes and Alanis Morissette. “We decided this year we wanted to welcome visitors to Miami Beach rather than have too much of an authoritative or dictatorial tone,” Matt Kenny, the city’s assistant director of marketing and communications, said in January. “We wanted to welcome them first and foremost to Miami Beach, make them feel welcome in our community while promoting local offerings and reminding them of our regulations to enjoy the city safely.” Since the end of February through last weekend, the measures had largely been working, said members of Miami Beach’s Black Affairs Advisory Committee. “Everything I’ve observed has been peaceful, just kids trying to have a good time, that’s all I’ve been seeing,” said Melba Pearson, a civil-rights lawyer and committee member who was speaking as a Miami Beach resident. Pearson said she thought the concert series, Goodwill ambassadors and lower arrest numbers had showed progress. But she was dismayed when the city announced the curfew in response to the two shootings. “It’s an absolute overreaction,” Pearson said. “Not to trivialize people being harmed or shot, but you have to have a balanced approach to issues of criminal justice and law enforcement.” Not everyone is against the curfew. Glendon Hall, who lives on Miami Beach and chairs the advisory committee, said he’s on board with the curfew. “I understand the issues the city is facing with the crowds and the shootings that have occurred,” he said. “A shooting with these crowds and the first instinct of everyone is to run and start a stampede. For me, as a longtime resident, there has to be something done.” And Hall said, if the curfew is handled properly, there aren’t likely to be many issues. He suggested telling volunteer “Goodwill Ambassadors” to tell the partiers to disperse, instead of cops in riot gear, for instance. “It can be done,” he said. “I was there last year. And as long as you don’t send a damn SWAT truck, it’ll work.” Miami Herald staff writer Martin Vassolo contributed to this story.",U.S./Miami Herald,‘Only emergency is that Black people are on the Beach.’ Critics blast spring break curfew,https://news.yahoo.com/only-emergency-black-people-beach-221047979.html
3/23/2022,"By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday urged an end to the ""absurd war"" started by Russia's invasion of Ukraine one month ago, warning that the conflict is ""going nowhere, fast"" and that the Ukrainian people are ""enduring a living hell."" ""Continuing the war in Ukraine is morally unacceptable, politically indefensible and militarily nonsensical,"" Guterres told reporters in New York. Russia is pounding the besieged Ukrainian port of Mariupol into the ""ashes of a dead land,"" its local council said on Tuesday, describing two more huge bombs that fell on the city that has been sealed off for weeks. ""Even if Mariupol falls, Ukraine cannot be conquered city by city, street by street, house by house,"" Guterres said. ""This war is unwinnable. Sooner or later, it will have to move from the battlefield to the peace table."" ""It is time to end this absurd war,"" he said. Russia launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24 to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure. Ukraine and its Western allies have accused Moscow of attacking civilians indiscriminately. Moscow denies attacking civilians. Guterres said some 10 million Ukranians have fled from their homes and warned the reverberations of war were being felt globally ""with skyrocketing food, energy and fertilizer prices threatening to spiral into a global hunger crisis."" ""There is enough on the table to cease hostilities - now ... and seriously negotiate - now,"" Guterres said.

3/23/2022,"Ukraine is believed to be running out of weapons as it continues to hold off Russian forces, amid warnings some countries have failed to send promised aid. Western nations have thrown their support behind the war-torn nation following Vladimir Putin's invasion on 24 February. According to The Times, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told Boris Johnson that his country was getting through a week's supply of weapons in just 20 hours as the Russian attack and constant shelling comes on multiple fronts. But while many countries have promised weapons to help bolster the Ukrainian arsenal, some have not kept up the supply. Paul Grod, president of the Ukrainian World Congress, told the newspaper that some nations – including Germany and France – had not delivered promised arms.

Some countries have sent extra weapons in previous days, which he said has only “partially improved” the situation. Ukrainian troops are also said to have resorted to using captured Russian “trophies”, such as vehicles and other equipment, to boost its own supplies and use against the invading force.

The Ukrainian armed forces have put up a fierce defence of their country, which is said to have taken Putin by surprise. Western intelligence officials believe Putin could be forced to resort to even more brutal tactics, including the use of chemical weapons. Western intelligence has suggested they may be opting to use more offensive tactics as the war goes on. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said on Thursday: ""We have seen indications that the Ukrainians are going a bit more on the offense now. ""They have been defending very smartly, very nimbly, very creatively in places that they believe are the right places to defend and we have seen them now in places particularly in the south, near Khersan, they have tried to regain territory.
