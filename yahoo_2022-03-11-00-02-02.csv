3/11/2022,"(Reuters) - Shares of Amazon.com Inc jumped 5% after the e-commerce giant's massive share split and buyback drew more investors to a stock that has seen its price skyrocket since going public 25 years ago. The company's 20-for-1 stock split is its first since 1999 and is in addition to a $10 billion share buyback. It also comes on the heels of a similar split announced by Alphabet Inc earlier this year. ""Amazon's management is looking to instil fresh confidence,"" AJ Bell Investment Director Russ Mould said, adding that the buyback was the company's first direct distributions of cash back to its shareholders since its stock market debut. The company's stock closed near a two-year low at $2,785.58 on Wednesday after riding a pandemic-induced rally in tech shares that brought it within striking distance of a $2 trillion valuation mark. Amazon's stock ticker was trending on investor focused social media site stocktwits.com and was among the most discussed on Reddit's wallstreetbets, according to sentiment aggregator Swaggystocks. Shares of Apple Inc and Tesla Inc rallied sharply after their stock splits in 2020, with Tesla eventually joining the S&P 500 by the end of the year. Amazon's stock split ""just makes inexperienced investors and traders feel better"", said Perri Dong, a China-based portfolio manager at Redwood Winslow LLC, who said he owns Amazon shares. ""It's just psychological. Some people believe the shares will have more liquidity but I argue it doesn't matter."" The company went public in 1997 at an IPO price of $18, or $1.50 when adjusted for stock splits that occurred in 1998 and 1999. The latest stock split will take effect on June 6. Amazon's share surge on Thursday was a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy market, where shares of mega cap companies such as Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp were trading lower.

3/11/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Locking in a price to sell coal at $84 a metric ton must have seemed like a good bet a year ago for Peabody Energy Corp. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Open to Russia's Neutrality Demand But Won’t Yield Territory, Aide Says China Warns U.S. Over Forming Pacific NATO, Backing Taiwan Ukraine Update: Turkey to Host Highest-Level Talks So Far Owners Fear Planes ‘Are Gone Forever’ After Russia Shields Them From Seizure China Pushes Conspiracy Theory About U.S. Labs in Ukraine Back then, many factories and offices were still shuttered, demand for electricity was weak and while vaccines were starting to be distributed, it was unclear when the world economy would mount a fuller recovery. Lining up hedge contracts for Peabody’s Wambo mine would ensure the Australia site would be profitable at a time when global leaders seemed committed to shifting away from the dirtiest fossil fuel. The world is, of course, significantly different today. Russia’s war in Ukraine has further fueled a rally in coal driven by a squeeze on global energy supplies. The Australian benchmark coal price is up more than 400% in the past 12 months, hitting $425 on Wednesday. And instead of reaping rewards from those hedges, Peabody got slammed with a $534 million margin call. The sum is more than half the cash the U.S. coal giant had at the end of December, and it prompted the company to arrange a $150 million credit line with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. That deal is now raising eyebrows for both its eye-popping 10% interest rate and for the fact that the bank announced in 2019 that it would phase out financing for coal. “It’s a lot of cash that has to go out the door now,” said Andrew Blumenfeld, data analytics director for McCloskey. “That’s why they had to do the deal with Goldman.” He said the 10% rate is unusually high, and compared it to “a payday loan” that’s needed to cover immediate expenses. Peabody shares plunged 17% after announcing the margin call, taking a chunk out of the gains they had made in recent months as the coal market boomed. The shares, which remain at their highest level since 2019, rose 6.3% at 9:36 a.m. Thursday. It could be just the beginning of the blow for Peabody, the biggest U.S. coal miner. Margin calls could increase if the coal market moves higher. Prices could reach $500 a ton this year, said Steve Hulton, senior vice president for coal markets at Rystad Energy in Sydney. The Goldman deal will give the company some breathing room, he added. “That’s what they're actually worried about,” he said, referring to the possibility of more margin calls. Peabody didn’t respond to calls and emails seeking comment. Goldman responded with its policy statement regarding financing coal, but didn’t provide further comment. Peabody’s margin call is one of the flashiest examples of how the volatility sweeping commodity markets will slam companies that are holding wrong-way bets. Prices for oil, metals and grains have surged since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which threatens to disrupt supplies at a time when many raw materials were already in production deficits. Chinese nickel company Tsingshan Holding Group Co. faces billions of dollars in potential losses on short positions in the metal, while commodities trading houses are being forced to seek additional financing as the historic price surges stretch credit limits. Coal’s Rally Coal prices started climbing in the middle of last year as the global economic recovery led to surging electricity consumption and unexpectedly revealed a global shortage of fuel for power plants. The Australian benchmark price almost tripled from the first quarter of 2021 to the third. The war in Ukraine has further spooked market fears over scarcity. Russia supplied almost 18% of global coal exports in 2020 and was the top supplier to Europe. Nations around the world are now seeking to line up other supplies, but that’s going to be tough. Few miners have been investing in new capacity to deliver a commodity that has a grim future in a world committed to fighting climate change, and they have limited ability to ramp up output. There was already a global shortage six months ago when countries were clamoring for fuel for power plants, and if Russia’s tons are taken off the market, that will only get worse. “This is more black swans than I’ve ever encountered,” said Blumenfeld of McCloskey. “I’ve never seen this kind of market.” In the long run, higher prices will be good for coal companies — even Peabody. The company has hedged 1.9 million tons from the Wambo mine, and has derivative contracts for a total of 2.3 million tons. Most of the deals were signed in the first half of 2021. Its seaborne thermal unit, comprising Wambo and another Australia mine, exported 8.7 million tons last year, and most of the output that’s not covered through the hedges is unpriced. That means the company can eventually take advantage of a market that’s never been higher. ‘Pure-Play Dinosaur’ The margin call is “short-term pain,” said Rystad’s Hulton. But the company will likely see significant revenue gains later on that will help it cover the expense of the financing from Goldman, he said. The $150 million credit line matures in 2025, and Peabody said the cash would “support the company’s potential near-term liquidity requirements.” For Goldman, providing financing to the biggest U.S. coal miner may seem to contradict its 2019 pledge. A close look at the details of its policy, though, shows that the bank said it would decline deals for “directly financing” new coal mines, leaving the door open for other arrangements. The bank has said it would phase out financing for thermal coal mining companies that don’t have a diversification strategy “within a reasonable timeframe.” Peabody has been mining coal since it was founded in 1883, making it a “pure-play dinosaur,” said Justin Guay, director of global climate strategy for Sunrise Project. While the company announced this month a joint venture to develop solar farms, he said the venture isn’t significant enough to shift the nature of Peabody’s business, and shouldn’t be seen as a diversification strategy. Goldman has “written themselves a weak policy, and now they’re driving a coal truck through those loopholes,” Guay said. “They just can’t help themselves.” (Adds shares in the sixth paragraph.)

Russian forces intensified their bombardment of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, the U.S. said. That’s even as Moscow announced a pause in fighting for Wednesday to open humanitarian corridors from cities including Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Sumy and Mariupol, according to Interfax. President Vladimir Putin signed an order restricting trade in unspecified goods and raw materials. Russia’s ruble was quoted lower versus the dollar in the offshore market before foreign-exchange trading resumes in Moscow after an extended break.

Inflation risks put sovereign bonds on the back foot. Crude climbed but at a slower pace, as the market digested the U.S. move to ban imports of Russian fossil fuels to punish the nation for the war. The U.K. will prohibit Russian barrels too but spare natural gas and coal. West Texas Intermediate oil was around the highest since 2008 at close to $125 a barrel. Wheat Tumbles as Traders Weigh Supply (3:12 a.m.) Wheat futures slumped by almost 5% as traders assessed the global supply outlook with war ravaging one of the world’s top grain-growing regions. The war in Ukraine has effectively shut off more than a quarter of the world’s supply of a food staple used in everything from bread to cookies and noodles. Ukraine and Russia are also major suppliers of corn, barley and sunflower oil. Wheat Tumbles as Traders Weigh Supply With War Raging in Ukraine Defense Secretary Speaks with Counterparts (2:12 a.m.) Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin discussed how NATO members can strengthen the alliance’s eastern flank on separate calls with his U.K., French and Slovak counterparts, according to a Pentagon statement. Congress Puts Off Vote on Russia Oil Ban (1:15 a.m.) A planned House vote on legislation banning the imports of Russian oil into the U.S. has been delayed even as President Joe Biden moved ahead with executive action amid growing political pressure to do so. Democrats now expect to hold the vote Wednesday, bringing it to the floor alongside a $1.5 trillion omnibus spending bill, a Democratic aide said. Squabbling between the two political parties emerged late Tuesday and slowed passage of the bipartisan bill. Pelosi Delays Vote on Banning Russian Crude Oil Imports Fitch Cuts Russia Bond Rating, Sees ‘Imminent’ Default (11:39 p.m.) Russia’s sovereign debt rating was cut to the second-lowest level by Fitch Ratings, which said a bond default is “imminent” because of the country’s financial isolation after the Ukraine invasion. Fitch cited a Russian measure that would require some creditors who hold foreign-currency-denominated Russian bonds to be repaid in rubles, which have plunged in value since the war began. Russia Central Bank Imposes New Foreign-Exchange Curbs (11:27 p.m.) Russia’s central bank banned banks from selling cash currency to citizens who do not already have FX accounts for a period of six months starting March 9, as it seeks to halt the ruble’s plunge. FX account-holders can take out up to $10,000 in cash, but additional withdrawals will be in rubles at market exchange rates. The move comes after Bank of Russia last week ordered brokers to charge 30% on currency conversions and banned cash transfers out of Russia above $10,000. Russians have rushed to take out cash in both foreign currency and rubles as markets slumped. Paypal Suspends Russia Service After Starbucks, Coca-Cola (11:09 p.m.) PayPal Holdings Inc. said it’s suspending services in Russia, joining U.S. companies including Starbucks Corp. and Coca-Cola Co. on the list of businesses to pull out of the country. The coffee chain’s licensee will provide support to the almost 2,000 partners in Russia who depend on the company for their livelihood, Starbucks said Tuesday in a statement posted on its website. The company had said last week that it would donate royalties from sales in Russia to relief efforts in Ukraine. U.S. May Hit Chinese Firms That Defy Sanctions (10:12 p.m.) The U.S. could take “devastating” action against Chinese companies that defy sanctions on Russia, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told the New York Times in an interview. She said the administration could “essentially shut” down firms such as chip-maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. if they continue to supply advanced technology to Russia. The U.S. and allies have imposed export curbs in response to the invasion of Ukraine that aim to cut Russia’s access to such equipment. Russia Issues Vague Order About Export Restrictions (9:05 p.m.) Putin signed an order to restrict trade in some goods and raw materials in response to sanctions from the U.S. and other countries, but left out key details about which products might be affected. The president said his cabinet still needs to define such items, according to a government statement. The Kremlin instructed the government to prepare a list of countries that the restrictions will apply to in two days. Apart from limits on taking currency out of the country, Russia’s retaliatory sanctions have so far been vague, including the creation of an ‘unfriendly country’ list and a threat to cut off natural gas supplies to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Russia is a major shipper of oil, gas, grain and metals. Poland Says It Could Send MiG-29 Jets to U.S. Base (9:02 p.m.) Poland’s Foreign Ministry said the government is ready to transfer all its MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S. air base at Ramstein, Germany, and place them at the disposal of the U.S. The move would presumably be part of a plan to eventually get the jets into Ukrainian territory. But it’s not clear that the U.S. or NATO nations would support such an effort because moving the jets into Ukraine from Germany would likely be seen by Russian President Vladimir Putin as an act of aggression. Pentagon officials didn’t immediately comment on the proposal. Some Progress With Civilian Evacuation in Sumy (8:45 p.m.) Evacuations in the northeastern town of Sumy have included 61 busloads of civilians to Poltava, while 1,000 foreign students are traveling by train to the border city of Lviv, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a top Ukrainian official, said Tuesday on Telegram. Some Sumy residents have also been able to drive out. Russia announced a ‘silence’ period on Wednesday to open humanitarian corridors from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Sumy and Mariupol, Interfax reported, citing an official at Russian humanitarian coordination headquarters. Congress Readies Billions in Ukraine Aid (8:38 p.m.) Congress plans to boost Ukraine aid to more than $13 billion. The money, an increase from the Biden administration’s initial request for $10 billion, will help deal with a mounting humanitarian crisis affecting Ukraine’s neighbors and bolster funding for the Pentagon, which will help replenish weapons and other material provided to Ukraine. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the funding includes loan guarantees to countries such as Poland to buy U.S.-made warplanes after they donate their Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine. The funding is to be included in an estimated $1.5 trillion annual budget bill the House is expected as soon as Wednesday. Russian Forces Intensify Kyiv Bombardment, U.S. Says (8:04 p.m.) Russian forces have intensified their bombardment of Kyiv, a key strategic target in their invasion, with isolated fighting inside the capital city, a senior U.S. defense official told reporters. But the bulk of Russian forces are still about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Kyiv, the official said. Russia has also succeeded in isolating Mariupol, a southern port city, but hasn’t taken it yet, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Zelenskiy Calls NATO ‘Afraid of Controversial Things’ (7:13 p.m.) U.S. stocks gained after Agence France-Presse re-reported comments from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he made late Monday in an interview with ABC News. AFP reported that “in a nod to Russia, Ukraine says no longer insisting on NATO membership.” In the interview with ABC News, Zelenskiy said: “Regarding NATO I have cooled down regarding this question a long time ago after we understood that NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine. The alliance is afraid of controversial things and confrontation with Russia. I never wanted to be a country that is begging something on its knees. And we’re not going to be that country, and I don’t want to be that president.” Zelenskiy’s comments don’t indicate he has abandoned the country’s hope of one day becoming a member of NATO. The military alliance says it has an open-door policy but has made clear that major obstacles remain to Ukraine joining and it won’t happen anytime soon. BBC to Resume English-Language Reporting From Russia (6:31 p.m.) The British broadcaster suspended English-language reporting from Russia at the end of last week. The BBC said in a statement it had since considered the implications of recently-passed media laws in Russia alongside the “urgent need” to report from inside the country. Swedish Premier Says a Push to Join NATO Would Add to Instability (5:30 p.m.) “If Sweden would choose to file an application to NATO in this situation it would further destabilize this part of Europe,” Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said at a briefing. “My assessment is clear: sticking to Sweden’s long-standing, consistent policy is what serves our security best.” Italy Prepared to Back More EU Sanctions Against Russian Banks (5:20 p.m.) The goal with a third package of EU sanctions would be to pressure Russia into a cease-fire, Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said an interview with Bloomberg. The EU won’t give in to “Russia’s blackmail” on energy, Di Maio said, referring to a threat to cut natural gas supplies via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Di Maio has traveled to Algeria and Qatar in recent days to discuss more gas supplies from those countries. Italy gets 40% of its gas imports from Russia.
