5/16/2022,"An Arkansas town is upset after someone shot a hole in their water tower in a very specific, and unfortunate location. The water tower in Kingsland, the birthplace of Johnny Cash, bears a painted silhouette of the famous Man in Black — but an unknown person recently took careful aim at Cash’s crotch and pulled the trigger. Now the mural is perpetually leaking from that spot, video shared May 11 by the Cleveland County Herald shows. Kingsland, population around 400, is 72 miles south of Little Rock. Betty Graham, water office manager, told the Herald it could take as long as a week to fix the damage. She saw the leak when she went into the office early that morning but assumed it was “routine overflow,” until sunrise, when the cold light of day revealed the work of the crude vandal, the Herald reported. Kingsland spent almost $300,000 last year improving the water tower. “Someone here knows who did this,” a comment read. “I hope they’ll come forward and turn the vandal in.” “This is just terrible. If they find out who it was they need to give them the max punishment. This is people’s livelihood, their water source,” said another. While not condoning vandalism, some felt that the perpetrator displayed a certain degree of panache. “Shouldn’t have done it, but as far as creativity goes its 1st class,” a comment said. Seeing harm come to the freshly refurbished water tower isn’t anything to laugh about, Graham said in a Facebook post. “People think it’s funny but a lot of hard work and effort went into getting the grant to get this painted,” Graham said. “It’s sad that someone could do this. Please if anyone heard the shot and knows the time or was out last night and saw something suspicious please let me or someone with the water Dept or the sheriff Dept know.” Triassic park theft: Someone cut fossil footprints from stone at Utah national park Teens poisoned fish during $380,000 vandalism spree to new Colorado homes, cops say Man scared locals, campers for 15 years with ‘acts of terror,’ Louisiana sheriff says Sprawling graffiti plagues Zion National Park as visitation booms, video shows",U.S./Kansas City Star,Johnny Cash mural is leaking from a crude spot after Arkansas water tower gets shot,https://news.yahoo.com/johnny-cash-mural-leaking-crude-211135756.html
5/16/2022,"  Putin ally Vladimir Potanin is reportedly snapping up Russian banks at a discount rate. Western businesses fled the country en masse following Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Per Forbes, Potanin is said to be Russia's richest man – worth just shy of $30 billion. Russia's richest man has been snapping up domestic banks at a discount rate, after their Western owners ditched the country, reports say. The Russian economy has been in freefall since the invasion of Ukraine, after Western powers issued sanctions against a number of President Vladimir Putin's closest allies, seizing and freezing their assets, and a host of leading businesses – from McDonald's to Goldman Sachs – shut down operations in the country altogether. Metals tycoon Vladimir Potanin, a long-time Putin ally, has largely avoided Western sanctions, despite his close personal ties to the regime. Experts say Potanin, who has played ice hockey with Putin in the past, has largely remained off the West's radar due to his personal importance to global metals markets. On Thursday, the Financial Times reported Potanin, who is said to be worth $30 billion, had been tapping into his estimated $30 billion fortune to obtain stakes in major Russian banks, which have seen their value dwindle after Western stakeholders abandoned the country. The billionaire's Interros group is said to have acquired Rosbank after Société Générale (SocGen), a French bank that bought the business from Potanin in 2008, opted for a quick exit from Russia. Insider previously reported banks still operating in Russia were preparing to lose huge amounts of money for exiting. Potanin reportedly obtained Oleg Tinkov's stake in TCS Group Holding, for which Tinkov, who said was forced to sell his stakes after he criticized the war, complained that Potanin paid only 3% of the actual stakes' worth, per the newspaper. Insider reached out to TCS and SocGen but did not immediately get a response. Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of political analysis firm R.Politik told the FT: ""The Kremlin had a geopolitically problematic asset [in Tinkoff] and Potanin had a solution."" Potanin's recent acquisitions make him a key individual in the banking sector. In February, Rosbank and Tinkoff, TCS's main assets, combined assets of almost $45 billion (RBS3 trillion). Someone involved in the negotiations for SocGen told the FT: ""We wanted to find a way to exit in the most orderly way while preserving our 12,000 staff."" They added: ""Potanin… says he wants to preserve the bank and its culture,"" that's why they decided to accept his offer that was quick and he knows the bank, per the report. Potanin founded Interros – a conglomerate with stakes in industries including mining, energy, and real estate – in 1990, and is the richest man in Russia, per Forbes. But he is mostly known for mastering the ""loans-for-shares"" programs, which many other oligarchs, including Roman Abramovich, have made their fortune through the programs. Under the ""loans-for-shares"" programs, wealthy entrepreneurs and banks loaned money to the Russian government in the 1990s in exchange for equity in the country's natural resource companies. The government often could not repay these loans, leaving many of the natural resource companies in the hands of wealthy individuals.
