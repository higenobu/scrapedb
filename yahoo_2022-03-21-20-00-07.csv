3/21/2022,"By Sabine Siebold and Robin Emmott ON BOARD THE SUPPLY SHIP ELBE, Latvia (Reuters) - Hours after Russian missiles first struck Ukrainian cities on Feb. 24, German naval commander Terje Schmitt-Eliassen received notice to sail five warships under his command to the former Soviet Republic of Latvia to help protect the most vulnerable part of NATO's eastern flank. The hasty dispatch was part of Germany's scramble to send ""everything that can swim out to sea,"" as the navy's top boss phrased it, to defend an area military strategists have long deemed the weakest point for the alliance. The vessels' sudden departure demonstrated how NATO, and Germany, were propelled by Russia's invasion into a new reality and face what officials, diplomats, intelligence officials and security sources agree is the most serious threat to the alliance's collective security since the Cold War. Schmitt-Eliassen, who is based in the German Baltic port of Kiel, spoke to Reuters on the flight deck of the supply ship Elbe. Moored next to it, within sight of the church towers of the Latvian capital Riga, were a Latvian and a Lithuanian ship, and vessels and sailors from nations including Denmark, Belgium and Estonia were due to join the group later. A total of 12 NATO warships with some 600 sailors on board are due to start a mine-clearing operation in the coming days. On Feb. 16, when intelligence showed an invasion was imminent, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called the current era a ""new normal."" It looks a lot like a return to the past. Founded in 1949 to defend against the Soviet threat, the NATO alliance is facing a return to mechanised warfare, a huge increase in defence spending, and potentially a new Iron Curtain falling across Europe. After struggling to find a new post-Cold War role, countering terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 and a humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, NATO is back defending against its original nemesis. But there's a difference. China, which split with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, has refused to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation."" And the old Cold War blueprints no longer work, as NATO has expanded east since the 1990s, bringing in former Soviet states – including the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in 2004. In early February, China and Russia issued a powerful joint statement rejecting NATO's expansion in Europe and challenging the Western-led international order. Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia could touch off a global conflict. ""We have reached a turning point,"" said retired German general Hans-Lothar Domroese, who led one of the highest NATO commands in the Dutch town of Brunssum until 2016. ""We have China and Russia acting in concert now, boldly challenging the United States for global leadership ... In the past, we have been saying deterrence works. Now we have to ask ourselves: Is deterrence enough?"" This is underscored by Schmitt-Eliassen's mission – a regular exercise that was brought forward by Russia's invasion. The issue is access. Before the Soviet Union was dissolved, NATO could have moved to contain the Soviet Union by blocking the western entrance of the Baltic Sea. That would seal in the Soviet Union's Baltic Fleet to prevent it from reaching the North Sea where its warships could attack U.S. supply convoys. Today, NATO's and Russia's roles have been reversed: An emboldened Moscow could encircle NATO's new Baltic members, and cut them off from the alliance. If a new Iron Curtain is to fall, NATO needs to ensure its members are not behind it (see map https://tmsnrt.rs/3tnekaO). The three tiny countries, with a combined population of some six million people, have a single overland link to the alliance's main territory. A corridor of some 65 km (40 miles) is squeezed between the heavily armed Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the west and Belarus on the east. So Schmitt-Eliassen's goal is to keep the waterway open, as a supply line also for non-NATO states Finland and Sweden. Millions of tons of old mines, ammunition and chemical weapons are believed to lie on the bed of the shallow Baltic Sea, a legacy of two World Wars. Mines – whether old and unexploded or freshly laid – can have an impact beyond destruction, Schmitt-Eliassen said. A mine sighting, or rumoured sighting, can close harbours for days while the area is swept. If that happens in the Baltic, there's a risk ""the supermarket shelves will remain empty."" Even commercial ships can become a military factor in the narrow western entrance to the Baltic, he said, referring to scenarios such as the March 2021 incident when the Ever Given container ship blocked traffic through the Suez Canal for days. ""You cannot blame anybody for this (kind of incident), it is not attributable,"" the chief of the German navy, vice-admiral Jan Christian Kaack, told Reuters. NEXT TARGET? Crucial for the Baltics is the land link between Kaliningrad and Belarus. Called the Suwalki Gap, its seizure would cut the Baltic states off. ""Putin could quickly seize the Suwalki Gap,"" said Domroese, the retired German general, adding this will not happen today or tomorrow, ""but it could happen in a few years."" Putin's recent actions have not all been predictable. He put Russia's nuclear forces on high alert on Feb. 28, with rhetoric that Stoltenberg told Reuters is ""dangerous, it's reckless."" The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment. Putin says Russia's concerns expressed over three decades about NATO's expansion were dismissed by the West, and post-Soviet Russia was humiliated after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. He says NATO, as an instrument of the United States, was building up its military on Ukraine's territory in a way that threatened Russia. On March 11, Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Putin the West was beefing up military forces close to Russia's Western borders. Putin asked Shoigu to prepare a report on how to respond. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelinskiy has warned that the Baltic states will be Russia's next target. The Baltic Sea is a large and busy shipping market for containers and other cargo, connecting Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia with the rest of the world. It ""has gone from being a normal peaceful area, to an area where you tread carefully,"" said Peter Sand, chief analyst at the air and ocean freight rate benchmarking platform Xeneta. With demand and logistics disrupted, the fees shippers pay to move cargoes from Hamburg to Saint Petersburg and Kaliningrad are down 15% since the invasion, according to Xeneta data. For almost 25 years, the West believed Russia could be tamed by diplomacy and trade to maintain stability and security in Europe. In 1997, NATO and Russia signed a ""founding act"" that was designed to build trust and limit both sides' force presence in eastern Europe. The alliance also sought to build a partnership with Russia, which took part in NATO exercises in the Baltic as recently as 2012, according to retired U.S. Admiral James Foggo, who commanded U.S. and NATO fleets in Europe for almost a decade until 2020. After Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, NATO created small, multinational combat units in Poland and the three Baltic states, which serve as a forward presence to deter Moscow. But the force numbers are designed not to violate the ""founding act,"" which has hindered NATO's ability to move troops into the Baltics and Poland on a permanent basis. ""We all thought that there wouldn't be an enemy anymore,"" Admiral Rob Bauer, the chairman of NATO's military committee, told Reuters. ""We now are confronted with a nation that is showing that it is aggressive, that it has forces that we thought were not going to be used anymore."" While the numbers are changing all the time, the number of troops under the command of NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe (SACEUR) Tod Wolters has more than doubled since Russia's invasion, to around 40,000, according to NATO diplomats and officials. NATO allies have also moved five aircraft carriers into European waters, in Norway and the Mediterranean, increased the number of warplanes in the air in NATO airspace and more than doubled the size of the combat units in the Baltics and Poland. Host nation forces number some 290,000 in the region, but mainly under national control. GERMANY'S MOMENT The biggest shift in NATO's ""new normal,"" diplomats, former officials and experts say, is Germany's reversal of a decades-long policy of low defence spending. Held back by guilt over its wartime past and resulting pacifism among its population, Germany resisted pressure from the United States to increase this to a NATO target of 2% of economic output. France and Britain both meet the goal, but Germany's defence spending was only 1.5% in 2021. With ageing equipment and personnel shortages, Berlin had been seen for decades as a weak partner because of its reluctance to send troops to combat operations. But on Feb. 27, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Berlin would now meet the 2% target - and promised a 100 billion euros ($110 billion) injection into the military. Germany has been concerned by Moscow's presence in the Baltic Sea for a while. After Russia's annexation of Crimea, Berlin forged an alliance of the western navies on the Baltic Sea. ""We simply had to take note of the fact that - whether we like it or not - we are the 900 pound gorilla in the ring,"" said navy chief Kaack. ""The way we look up to the United States as a smaller partner, that's how our partners here look at us."" Soon after Russia's invasion, Berlin announced it would buy 35 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets from the United States to replace its ageing Tornado fleet. NO MORE CONSTRAINTS The United States is also moving more military equipment into Europe, including vehicles and weapons to Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland that could be used immediately by newly arriving U.S. troops, rather than waiting weeks for tanks and trucks to be shipped from U.S. bases. Douglas Lute, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, told Reuters that NATO's ""new normal"" should be a step up from what the alliance agreed after Crimea. It is likely to be set down in writing in NATO's official master strategy document, known as its ""Strategic Concept,"" which will be agreed at the next NATO summit in Madrid in June. ""You'll see a push forward of combat capability to both reassure eastern allies and to make an even more prominent deterrence message to Russia,"" Lute said. He said NATO's existing multinational combat units in the Baltics and Poland – originally some 5,000 troops in total - should be significantly increased in size. He said he expected ""more sophisticated air defence systems postured forward,"" including Patriot and other systems in the Baltics and Poland. And he expects more U.S. weapons and military equipment to be pre-positioned in Europe. More NATO troops could be stationed in Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary. The U.S. delegation to NATO declined to comment. Its envoy, Julianne Smith, said on March 15 the alliance was making commitments to ""have more force posture in Central and Eastern Europe and develop new policy tools."" But – just as in the Cold War – NATO will need to keep communicating with Russia to avoid risking accidents with potentially devastating consequences. ""NATO has some responsibility to do more than just trying to keep Russia out,"" said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO and now director of the European Leadership Network think tank in London. ""It's about the management of an unavoidable strategic instability.""

3/21/2022,"""Russia is suffering troop losses and has been unable to take Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv as of yet, but the Russians are expanding their attacks,"" trying to break out of their current stalemate, CNN's Jake Tapper said Sunday. ""What is going wrong for the Russians?"" he asked David Petraeus, the retired four-star general and former CIA director. ""Well, an awful lot, actually,"" Petraeus said.

""It's very, very uncommon"" for U.S. generals to die in battle, Petraeus agreed, and ""this is in the first three weeks, and these are quite senior generals."" ""The bottom line is that their command and control has broken down, their communications have been jammed by the Ukrainians, their secure coms didn't work, they had to go to single channel,"" then cellphones, then stolen cellphones, Petraeus explained. ""So what happens is the column gets stopped, an impatient general is sitting back there in his armored —or whatever — vehicle, he goes forward to find out what's going on because there's no initiative"" among junior officers, ""he gets up there, and the Ukrainians have very, very good snipers, and they've just been picking them off, left and right. And at least four of these five are absolutely confirmed, and I think the fifth we'll hear today."" Petraeus also gave a broader overview of the Ukrainian war, including the strategic importance of Mariupol, Odessa, and ultimately Kyiv for both Ukraine and Russia. Mariupol ""is the first place where the Russians are having to do no-kidding urban fighting,"" at great cost, he said. And how long the besieged Ukrainians can hold out is ""very important,"" because ""if they do surrender, these forces will be freed to go back up"" to try and capture Kyiv or join other key battles.

3/21/2022,"(Reuters) - Gennady Timchenko, a long-time ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, resigned from the board at gas producer Novatek on Monday after he was targeted by sanctions over Russia's military campaign in Ukraine. Novatek, Russia's largest private natural gas producer, did not provide a reason for his resignation. A representave of Timchenko, who had served on the company's board of directors since 2009, declined to comment. The European Union and Britain last month imposed sanctions on Timchenko and other billionaires with ties to Putin. Timchenko, already on a U.S. sanctions list over Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea, was Russia's sixth-richest billionaire last year with a net worth of $22 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it said were dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces. Timchenko, who sits on the board of petrochemicals producer Sibur, was co-founder of Switzerland-based oil trader Gunvor. Timchenko sold his stake in Gunvor in 2014 after the United States imposed sanctions against him. Timchenko has said he owned a few trading companies in and near St Petersburg in the 1990s, when Putin worked in the office of the city's mayor.

3/21/2022,"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Lagging behind Russia in developing hypersonic weapons, the U.S. Navy is rushing to field its first, with installation on a warship starting as soon as late next year. The United States is in a race with Russia and China to develop these weapons, which travel at speeds akin to ballistic missiles but are difficult to shoot down because of their maneuverability. The Russian military says it already deployed hypersonic missiles, claiming on both Saturday and Sunday to have deployed them against targets in Ukraine marking the weapon's first use in combat. The Pentagon couldn’t confirm a hypersonic weapon was used in the attacks. The American military is accelerating development to catch up. The U.S. weapon would launch like a ballistic missile and would release a hypersonic glide vehicle that would reach speeds seven to eight times faster than the speed of sound before hitting the target. In Maine, General Dynamics subsidiary Bath Iron Works has begun engineering and design work on changes necessary to install the weapon system on three Zumwalt-class destroyers. The work would begin at a yet-to-be-named shipyard sometime in fiscal year that begins in October 2023, the Navy said. Hypersonic weapons are defined as anything traveling beyond Mach 5, or five times faster than the speed of sound. That's about 3,800 mph (6,100 kph). Intercontinental ballistic missiles far exceed that threshold but travel in a predictable path, making it possible to intercept them. The new weapons are maneuverable. Existing missile defense systems, including the Navy’s Aegis system, would have trouble intercepting such objects because maneuverability makes their movement unpredictable and speed leaves little time to react. Russia says it has ballistic missiles that can deploy hypersonic glide vehicles as well as a hypersonic cruise missile. The U.S. is “straining just to catch up” because it failed to invest in the new technology, with only a fraction of the 10,000 people who were working on the program in the 1980s, said U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat who's chair of a subcommittee that monitors the program. “If we want to pursue parity, we will need to back this effort with more money, time, and talent than we are now,” he said. The Russian invasion of Ukraine serves as a backdrop as the Pentagon releases its budget proposal that lays out its goals for hypersonics and other weapon systems later this month. The three stealthy Zumwalt-class destroyers to be equipped with the new weapons have plenty of space to accommodate them — thanks to a design failure that works to the Navy’s advantage in this instance. The ships were built around a gun system that was supposed to use GPS-guided, rocket-boosted projectiles to pound targets 90 miles (145 kilometers) away. But those projectiles proved to be too expensive, and the Navy canceled the system, leaving each of the ships with a useless loading system and a pair of 155-mm guns hidden in angular turrets. The retrofit of all three ships will likely cost more than $1 billion but will give a new capability to the tech-laden, electric-drive ships that already cost the Navy $23.5 billion to design and build, said Bryan Clark, a defense analyst at the Hudson Institute. “The engineering is not that hard. It’ll just take time and money to make it happen,” Clark said. The Navy intends to field the weapons on the destroyers in the 2025 fiscal year and on Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines in the 2028 fiscal year, the Navy said. The destroyers would be based in the Pacific Ocean, where they would be a deterrent to China, should it become emboldened by Russia's attack on Ukraine and consider attacking Taiwan, Clark said. The U.S. focus on hypersonic weapons represents a pivot after hesitating in the past because of technological hurdles. Adversaries, meanwhile, continued research and development. Russia fired off a salvo of Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles in late December, heralding the completion of weapon testing. But Russia may be exaggerating the capability of such super weapons to compensate for weakness in other areas, said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute. For the time being, Russia doesn't have many of the weapons, and it's unclear how effective they are, he said.",World/Associated Press,Ukraine war is backdrop in US push for hypersonic weapons,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-war-backdrop-us-push-113007790.html
3/21/2022,"The United States’ reactionary moves to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine suggest that it does not have an adequate plan in place to respond if Russian President Vladimir Putin decides to use a nuclear weapon, a former U.S. intelligence officer told Fox News. Rebekah Koffler, a former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency agent and author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America,"" explained to Fox News that while the U.S. certainly has a strategic plan in place if Putin uses a nuclear weapon, recent responses to Russia’s aggression instill little confidence that the United States is doing the necessary preparation for such an outcome. RUSSIA CLAIMS TO HIT UKRAINE WITH HYPERSONIC MISSILE, EXPERT WARNS IT IS PART OF PUTIN’S ‘STRATEGIC PLAN’ Koffler said that ""the fact that we have not responded in a methodical manner to any of Putin’s actions nor have we deterred any of his actions"" is reason to be concerned that the United States does not have a coherent plan to respond to a potential nuclear attack. ""Judging by our overall response and that we put all our eggs in one basket with sanctions and we were caught off guard regardless of the fact Putin never made it a secret what he was going to do yet we are grasping at straws,"" Kofffler said. ""Given that, it doesn’t seem that we are prepared for the possibility of him using nuclear weapons."" ""The minute that Putin said he changed the combat readiness status we didn’t say anything,"" Koffler said. ""This whole confusion seems like a haphazard approach on our side."" Koffler says that the United States should be very active in putting together a contingency plan and establishing back channels to prevent Putin from de-escalating the war through escalation, a strategy Putin has developed over his years in power. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES As far as the likelihood that Putin would resort to using a nuclear weapon, Koffler says that Putin is capable of making such a drastic decision. ""He has high risk tolerance,"" Koffler said of Putin. ""I believe that it is within his frame of mind."" Russia claimed on Saturday that it deployed a hypersonic missile that destroyed a munitions warehouse in Ukraine, which Koffler said is part of a strategic plan Putin is using to show the world he has a ""high tolerance for warfare."" ""It's a game-changer in the geopolitical realm, not unlike in the military realm, because they're trying to [send a] strategic message,"" she said. ""In my assessment, [Putin] is climbing small steps in the escalation ladder on the trajectory to nuclear warfare."" ""We are so focused on thinking that it's so crazy and outside the realm of possibility,"" Koffler said about the potential use of a nuclear weapon. ""But think about all the crazy things he has already done. ""He invaded Crimea. He is now attacking Ukraine in the most brutal manner possible."" Koffler explained that the nuclear option isn’t necessarily one of the next steps Putin will take but that it can’t be ""ruled out"" because the further you ""drive Putin into the corner"" the more the ""probability increases because he has everything at stake right now.""",World/Fox News,US doesn't 'seem prepared' for possibility that Putin uses nuclear weapons: expert,https://news.yahoo.com/us-doesn-apos-t-apos-005448621.html

3/21/2022,"Tasmanian tigers, also known as Tasmanian wolves or thylacines, hold a special place in the history of conservation. They were the only member of their family, thylacinidae, which made it to modern times. They were strange looking animals, an amalgamation of features from animals we’re more familiar with today. They shared some features with wild dogs, though their bodies were comparatively squat, and they had a series of 15 to 20 stripes along their back half. They were also one of the only marsupial species in which both the males and females had pouches. Evidence suggests the species appeared about 4 million years ago and the last confirmed thylacine died in a zoo on Sept. 7, 1936. That date has been observed as National Threatened Species Day in Australia since 1996. The species wasn’t officially recognized as extinct until 1982 and there are unconfirmed sightings of the species, even today. Though, most scientists don’t give those reports any credit. The fate of the Tasmanian tiger can be traced directly back to human interference. A combination of habitat loss and a directed hunting and bounty program resulted in the decline and disappearance of the species. All these years after the last Tasmanian tiger died, we have an opportunity to reverse course and bring them back. A team of scientists at the University of Melbourne, lead by Professor Andrew Pask, recently received a philanthropic gift of $5 million AUD to be used for the Thylacine Integrated Genetic Restoration Research Lab, TIGRR for short. The goal of the project is to develop a program for the resurrection of the species. Conversations around the resurrection of extinct species often center on whether or not a population could exist in a world which may no longer resemble the one they used to inhabit. The historical habitat of the Tasmanian tiger has remained largely unchanged, making them a good candidate for de-extinction. To that end, Pask and colleagues have outlined a nine-step process for returning the Tasmanian tiger to its previous niche. The monetary gift the lab received should fund 10 years of research, which is roughly how long Pask believes it should take, and the program is already off to a good start. The first two steps involve sequencing the thylacine genome and the genomes of its closest living relatives. Those two steps have already been completed. A high-quality thylacine genome was sequenced in 2018, and we’ve also sequenced the genomes of the fat-tailed dunnart and the marsupial mouse, two of the thylacines closes living relatives. The genomes of the dunnart and the marsupial mouse will provide a foundation upon which a Tasmanian tiger embryo could be constructed. The next step in the process is comparing the thylacine genome to its living relatives to identify the genes which would need to be edited to make an embryo. From there, scientists will need to get stem cells from model species, at present they are targeting the fat-tailed dunnart for this step. The next steps involve developing assistive reproductive technologies, essentially nailing down the process of embryo creation and transfer to a living surrogate. The team believes that marsupials have a particular advantage for resurrection, owing to their comparatively short gestation periods. Anyone familiar with kangaroos knows that joeys are born very early in the development process and spend the remainder of their development in the pouch. Tasmanian tigers had a similar reproductive process, meaning the amount of time the embryo would need to develop inside a surrogate is brief. The final steps involve developing a process for taking newborns from the surrogate and raising them to independence, probably via bottle feeding away from the surrogate. We may even be able to grow newborns without using a surrogate at all. The road ahead is long and complex, but advances in de-extinction technologies have become more common in recent years, as evidenced by efforts around the black-footed ferret and the northern white rhino. In the meantime, Pask and colleagues believe these technologies will have benefits for living and threatened species. We should make every effort to minimize our negative impact on the species which share our planet, but it’s nice to know that if all else fails, we might be able to undo our mistakes.

Ukrainian officials have reported that five high-ranking officers within the Russian army have been killed since the country began its invasion of Ukraine last month, though only one has been confirmed by Moscow.
