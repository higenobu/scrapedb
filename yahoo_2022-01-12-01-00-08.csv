1/12/2022,"Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary may be bulking up his portfolio with cryptocurrency these days, but he is slimming down his weight. The 5’10” millionaire businessman is currently 164 pounds, after dropping 20 pounds late last year. O’Leary tells Yahoo Finance Live he was incentivized to shed those pandemic pounds after his annual medical checkup revealed he had high blood pressure. “My doctor said you’ve got to lose 20 pounds, your blood pressure is way up. It’s been going up every year because you’ve been gaining weight,” said O'Leary, chairman of O'Shares Investment. ""That happens to a lot of people, over time, you become more sedentary and put on pounds."" At his doctor’s recommendation, the 67-year-old began intermittent fasting, and he says the pounds started melting off. “I fast for 16 hours everyday so basically, I don’t eat breakfast,” O’Leary said. “I have my meal at 7 or 8 at night, maybe a little later, and then I don’t eat again until around 1 in the afternoon the next day. It was hell for the first 3 weeks, and now I’m never hungry,” he said. “It’s a remarkable thing what your body can do if you get used to it.” A passionate wine drinker and investor, O’Leary has even cut back on drinking alcohol, despite owning the the award-winning wine label, O’Leary Fine Wines. He admits reducing his wine intake hasn’t been easy but says it quickly eliminates a few hundred daily calories from his diet. On average, there are 200 calories in an 8-ounce glass of red wine. O’Leary also says he makes an effort to eat right, which means plenty of salads and fresh fish and makes time for physical activity every day — even if that just means going for a walk.

Enako has lots of costumes. Enako, Japan’s most famous and successful cosplayer, has a whole bunch of costumes. How many? An entire storage room full of them. Cosplay has become big business in Japan—and Enako has been, no doubt, the most successful cosplayer the country has seen. So, no wonder she needs a warehouse for all her threads!

By 2016, she was making around $9,000 a month from cosplay. But that number soon shot up. By 2019, she was making over $90,000 a month. At that time, Enako said she was being hired as a spokesperson for anime and game companies, and was also earning income from streaming.
 
This is a good way to organize your costumes. Now, she appears on the cover of numerous Japanese magazines, acts in movies as well as providing voice acting, and has even recorded pop music. According to the Japanese media, Enako currently rakes in the equivalent of around one million dollars a year. Her success has been big news in Japan, with some smarting from the idea of a cosplayer making so much money. According to Enako, “Some people say, ‘Pay taxes,’ and I reply, ‘I’m freaking paying ‘em.’” In the clip below, Enako shows off her costume warehouse. It looks to be an entire apartment filled with storage containers.
 When asked how many costumes she has, Enako replied, “I wonder. I’ve never counted them, but I think around 400 to 500 [costumes].” With that many costumes, you must be organized.
 
This is a good way to keep track of the outfits, too. Each container has a photo of the contents, with some labels featuring an image of the character that Enako will bring to life.  コスプレイヤーえなこの衣装倉庫！奥にウィッグや造形(剣とか杖とか)を管理する部屋もあるよ(*⁰▿⁰*)オタクなら絶対テンション上がると思う…✨ pic.twitter.com/iMOrr5ntxt — えなこ (@enako_cos) January 5, 2022 In the back, there’s a room for wigs along with props like swords and canes.  Last year, Kotaku reported that the Japanese government mulled copyright law changes for those who made big money from cosplaying, that would require professional cosplayers to pony up a licensing fee. Note that the proposed legislation would not impact fan cosplayers.  At that time, Enako discussed the issue, explaining that when she goes on television or appears at paid events, she dresses as original characters to avoid copyright infringement. Moreover, she adds that she also gets permission when she cosplays as characters created by others. As mentioned above, cosplay is big business.

1/12/2022,"In an audio interview with Chinese filmmaker Li Xuezheng, Chinese actor Zhang Zhehan spoke up about his Yasukuni Shrine scandal for the first time, explaining what has been happening these past few months.  Li posted the 10-minute interview on his Weibo page page on 1 January. “I am certain that building is not Yasukuni Shrine, as I went to Japan during the cherry blossom season with my friends to see cherry blossoms,” Zhang said, regarding a photo of him with cherry blossom trees and a building at Yasukuni Shrine. “I did not enter the Yasukuni Shrine, nor did I offer my prayers at the shrine.” Based simply on the pictures that made the rounds on the internet, Zhang was in fact in the well-known sakura tree courtyard inside the sprawling Yasukuni Shrine compound.  However, it would not be wrong to say that the photo circulated does not show Zhang inside the main worship hall of Yasukuni Shrine.  Yasukuni Shrine has long been a flashpoint of conflict between people in China and Japan because the shrine commemorates the war dead during World War II, including Japanese war criminals.  The location where Zhang took his photo appears to be outside a management building of the shrine, just outside the Nakamon Torii gate, which is the entrance to the main worship hall of the shrine. However, the area around Yasukuni Shrine is a tourist hotspot as it features the key cherry blossom tree used by the Tokyo District Meteorological Observatory to determine the cherry blossom flowering period. Here is the Google Street View of the management building where Zhang took his photo: Zhang also went on to explain the cyber harassment he has been facing, “Both my mother and I fell into a state of panic. I didn’t dare to go out and even started to doubt myself. I’ve been very patriotic but suddenly, after the incident, people are calling me a traitor. They even called my mum the mistress of a Japanese and insulted my dad, who actually passed away in 2016. I’ve been living in fear and don't dare to go out.” After the controversy broke last year, Zhang had released a statement of apology in August, stressing that he loves his motherland. Here’s the full audio interview with English subtitles by Zhang’s fan: Zhang said his mother, on several occasions, even asked him whether she had to jump off a building to prove her innocence. Zhang also wondered if he had to dig out his heart to show his love for his country. To make things worse, haters allegedly sent him funeral wreaths and created his mourning portraits. At the end of the interview, Zhang said, “I’m willing to be investigated and questioned, and I hope to prove my innocence.” Zhang became popular last year for his role in the BL drama, Word Of Honor, before his Yasukuni Shrine scandal broke.  The China Association of Performing Arts put him on a blacklist of undesirable celebrities and Zhang was dropped as ambassador for brands like Longines, Pandora and Lanvin.  Filmmaker and producer Li Xuezheng previously criticised the China Association of Performing Arts, questioning whether it had the right to blacklist disgraced celebrities before they go through the legal system. Li was banned by Weibo from making further posts after he uploaded his interview with Zhang.

1/12/2022,"A hungry hyena in Botswana was in no mood to abide by the finders-keepers rule of the wild as a python constricted an impala lamb. (Watch the video below.) In viral footage posted recently by Latest Sightings, the hyena eventually picked up the impala ― with the snake coiled around it ― and attempted to tote the bounty away. That didn’t appear to do the trick, though. The hyena continued to harass the python to surrender its prey, and the snake finally slithered away. “The hyena devoured the impala lamb in minutes as the mother impala looked on in agony,” videographer Mike Sutherland of the Escape Safari Co. told Latest Sightings. “We were all intrigued by what was happening, and we all felt quite distraught and in shock by the scenes that unfolded. It took some explaining and guiding to get the guests to understand fully the fact that nature can be cruel, but also has strange ways that we can learn from it.” The hyena, a scavenger and hunter, does sometimes kill and eat snakes, according to National Geographic. But this one appeared more interested in the snake’s quarry. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.
