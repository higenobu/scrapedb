1/28/2022,"Elon Musk compared the toilet paper shortages to global chip shortage during Tesla's Q4 earnings call. Musk said he took his children to Walmart and H-E-B to see the shortages for himself. He said toilet paper is an ""odd choice"" of item for people to panic-buy. Elon Musk went to witness pandemic panic-buying of toilet paper for himself, the billionaire told investors. Musk revealed the excursion while discussing the global chip shortage during Tesla's Q4 earnings call on Wednesday. On the call, Musk compared the global chip shortage to toilet paper shortages that hit stores and supermarkets early in the pandemic. ""I think there's some degree of the toilet paper problem as well where there was a toilet paper shortage during COVID. Obviously, it wasn't really certainly a tremendous enhanced need for ass-wiping. It's just people panicked and got every paper product you could possibly wipe your ass with basically,"" Musk said. He then told investors he had been so intrigued by the toilet paper shortages, he had gone to see them for himself. ""I wasn't sure, is this like a real thing or not? I actually took my kids to the H-E-B and Walmart in Texas to just confirm if it was real. Indeed, it was. And there's plenty of food and everything else but just nothing, no paper products,"" he said. Musk said toilet paper was an ""odd choice"" of item for people to panic about. ""If [the] end of the world is coming, I think toilet paper is the least of your problems,"" he said. Musk expressed skepticism over the severity of the pandemic in its early stages. In March 2020 he tweeted ""the coronavirus panic is dumb."" He also raged against stay-at-home orders, describing them as ""fascist"" and saying they amounted to ""forcible imprisoning of people in their homes against all of their constitutional rights"" during a Tesla earnings call in April. The Tesla billionaire told Time magazine in December 2021 that he and his children are vaccinated, and he opposes mask mandates.

1/28/2022,"Security footage now has been made public showing a Black student being ordered by a white lunch monitor at a school in Lorain, Ohio, to eat food the girl had thrown in the trash. After asking for months to see the video of the incident at Palm Elementary School, the parents of the child, who’s also suing the school, says the footage confirms everything their daughter told them. The Lorain City School District released surveillance footage of the act on Wednesday, Jan. 19. The school district blurred the students’ faces out before its release to the public. The incident, captured in a 34-minute full-length video released by the district, happened in November 2021. In the upper left corner of the abridged video, the camera shows a child throwing her finished lunch into the garbage can, telling the principal she did not like the waffles. A white adult woman wearing a T-shirt and blue jeans pulled the food out of the trash can, wiped off the package of food and told the female student to eat what had been thrown into the garbage. The video shows the 9-year-old fourth grader refusing to do what the adult aid asks, but eventually acquiesce. At one point the aid sits next to the student to ensure she eats the food. Jared Klebanow, one of the attorneys representing the interest of the girl and her family, stated that the video validates the student’s recollection of the events. He also said the family has asked for months to see the video, but did not see it until the public release. Upon seeing the video, the child reportedly was retraumatized, reliving the feelings of embarrassment and humiliation that she felt at that moment at the school last fall. The attorney spoke of actions in the video. “What we see is a student finish with her lunch … again, a student finish with her lunch and she goes to throw the lunch away like hundreds and thousands of students across the country do every day. We see in the video, this monitor, the named defendant, go ahead and grab the waffle out of the garbage,” he continued. “And she appears to instruct the student to go get a paper towel, go back to her seat.” He added, “She places the waffle at the table and then for a matter of minutes is talking with her, instructing her, as we know from the victim’s standpoint, that she needs to eat this waffle that was in the garbage and the monitor goes as far as to sit right next to her, as is alleged in the complaint, and intimidate her into doing so,” he said. The lawyer alleges the video confirms the testimony of the student, and said, “unfortunately, in our world and society today, had that video not been there, it might have just been a child’s word against a teacher, an administrator, which is a tough spot to be in.” Cleveland 19 reported that the district discovered during its investigation that the girl was pressured to eat the food from the trash receptacle; once home, she told her parents. One of her parents came to the school and filed an official complaint. The principal received the complaint, but reportedly did not follow the appropriate protocol. Since the district’s investigation, both the principal and the cafeteria monitor have been fired. Still, the girl’s family believes that the termination of the two adults is a quick fix and that they should have their day in court for the pain and suffering they’ve expressed that they’re experiencing. LaTosha Williams, the girl’s mom, said that her child had become sick after eating the food and that since she missed time from work while staying home to nurse her daughter, she lost her job. “It literally flipped my whole family upside down,” she said in December. “She has changed at home. She doesn’t act the same. She doesn’t even want to go to school.” The family filed a lawsuit that seeks admission of wrongdoing, a collaborative effort to prevent such incidents in the future and an undetermined amount of money. District superintendent Jeff Graham addressed the issue after the investigation, saying, “Any infringement upon the dignity and respect of our students will not be tolerated. Our students deserve staff members who are able to make good decisions in all situations. And any staff member who is unable to deliver on that promise is unwelcome in our schools.” The school district has offered no further statement about the incident or the lawsuit.

1/28/2022,"Democratic lawmakers urged Biden to release a memo on his legal ability to cancel student debt. Psaki touted the two-year pause in student-loan repayment in response to a letter from 85 Democrats. The White House remains near silent on the memo and Biden's promise to forgive student debt broadly. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers asked the White House for answers on the student-debt crisis on Wednesday, and the White House responded by touting already implemented relief. During a press briefing, a reporter asked Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, about a letter that 85 Democratic lawmakers sent to President Joe Biden on Wednesday demanding the release of a memo that outlines his legal ability to cancel student debt broadly and the forgiveness of up to $50,000 in student debt for every federal borrower. When asked if Biden planned to release the contents of the memo, Psaki responded: ""No one has been required to pay a single dime in federal student loans since the president took office over a year ago, and I'll also add that our country is seeing one of the strongest economic recoveries in history, and the pause announced in December gives some breathing room for several more months to borrowers who are still coping with the pandemic."" She added that ""the president supports Congress sending him a bill that would provide $10,000 in debt relief, and he continues to look into what debt relief can be taken administratively."" Psaki was referring to the three extensions of the student-loan-payment pause under Biden, with the most recent extension being through May 1. Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, told Politico last April that Biden asked Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to create a memo on the president's legal authority to forgive $50,000 in student loans per person. As Insider reported in November, redacted documents obtained by the Debt Collective, the nation's first debtors union, indicated that the memo has existed since April 5, and that White House officials have seen its contents but haven't made them public. The White House has yet to acknowledge those documents and has stayed relatively quiet about Biden's campaign promise to approve $10,000 in student-debt forgiveness for every federal borrower. For example, during his first solo press conference of the year, Biden ignored a question from a reporter who asked if he planned to fulfill that promise. And in December, Psaki reiterated her Wednesday comments on the matter, telling reporters that if Congress sent Biden a bill to cancel student debt broadly, he would be ""happy to sign it."" But Democratic lawmakers are growing restless and want answers from the White House. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez said during a virtual roundtable on Wednesday that ""it would be good to be publicly known"" whether Biden has the legal authority to cancel student debt. ""I have not read the memo,"" he added, ""but it is my view that the memo should ultimately certify that the president has the authority to do exactly what we're advocating for.""
