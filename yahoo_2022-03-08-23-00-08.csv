3/8/2022,"By Chayut Setboonsarng and Panarat Thepgumpanat BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thousands of tourists from Russia are currently stranded in Thailand, officials said on Tuesday, as unprecedented Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine put a squeeze on Russians struggling to find flights and finances. Flight cancellations, a rouble currency in free-fall and payment problems from Russian banks being cut off from the global SWIFT system has left more than 7,000 Russians in limbo in locations like Phuket, Koh Samui, Pattaya and Krabi, Thailand's tourism authority chief said. ""We have to be good hosts and take care of everybody,"" Yuthasak Supasorn told Reuters. ""There are still Russian tourists on their way here,"" he added. Russia's embassy in Bangkok did not immediately respond to request for comment on its citizens. In 2019, Thailand received 1.4 million Russian visitors. In January, it counted about 23,000 Russians, representing about a fifth of the total arrivals. About half of those stranded were on the island of Phuket. ""We've asked hotels to reduce prices and extend their stays,"" Phuket's tourism association president Bhummikitti Ruktaengam said. Some visitors, when able, had used China's UnionPay after cards issued by Russian banks using U.S. payment firms Visa and Mastercard stopped working, he said. Visa and Mastercard announced on Saturday they were suspending operations in Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Russia has called its actions there a ""special operation"". Though Thailand was among 141 countries that backed a United Nations resolution calling for the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops, it has not imposed any sanctions on Moscow. Bhummikitti said hundreds of people from Ukraine were also stranded, mainly due to airport closures there. He said efforts were being made to get stranded Russians onto flights to Moscow on Middle Eastern airlines and to arrange repatriation flights. A proposal was being considered to allow the use of cryptocurrency for payments at hotels, flights and other businesses in Phuket, he said.

3/8/2022,"A former Ohio nursing assistant is facing several charges involving the alleged sexual abuse of elderly patients in her care, according to police. Tiara Lynn Ford, 23, is accused of sexually abusing and filing patients at a nursing facility she worked at in Massillon, Ohio, about 25 miles south of Akron. She was arrested at her home last week. Ford was indicted on a trio of charges, including rape and two counts of gross sexual imposition, according to court records obtained by Oxygen.com. Ford’s arrest follows a two-week investigation led by local police into her alleged predatory conduct at The Inn at University Village, WEWS-TV reported. ""Shock, shock — that's about the best way to describe my reaction to this,"" Massillon Police Detective David McConnell told the outlet. According to police, some of the victimized patients were non-verbal and suffered from dementia. ""Some of them couldn't even speak, McConnell added. “You know, they're elderly, [they] didn't know what was going on and she did it for her own personal gratification.” In some cases, investigators said she recorded videos of the alleged sexual assaults. “And she admitted to all these, admitted to taking these videos of herself,"" McConnell said. Ford worked at The Inn at University City in Massillon, though it’s unclear how long she may have worked at the assisted living residence. The assisted living facility declined to comment on Ford’s open case on Monday, to verify the accused woman’s employment history or say whether she’s been terminated. “No, no I’m not giving any information, I’m sorry,” Amy Joy, the executive director for The Inn at University City told Oxygen.com on Monday afternoon. The facility, which specializes in care for patients living with Alzheimer’s and dementia, previously issued a prepared statement. ""The safety and well-being of our residents is our highest priority,” the statement said, according to WEWS-TV. “We have recently been notified that a former employee was involved in mistreating residents. We immediately notified the involved families, police department and other appropriate authorities. We are fully cooperating with the authorities in their investigation. Because of the ongoing investigation and HIPAA laws, we are unable to comment further at this time."" Ford had previously passed a background check, according to state officials. Police, who said it’s possible there could be more victims, are encouraging families who may have loved ones at the facility to come forward. ""I don't believe there are, but we are going to make sure there are not,"" McConnell also stated. Authorities haven’t released additional information. Keith Moser, Massillon’s Chief of Police, wasn’t immediately available when contacted by Oxygen.com this week. Ford was arraigned on March 4 in Stark County Common Pleas Court, additional court filings show. A judge subsequently set her bond at $250,000. The Canton woman’s next court date is set for March 11. It’s unclear if she’s retained legal representation to comment on her behalf.

3/8/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov set out Moscow's position on the conflict in Ukraine to Vatican State Secretary Pietro Parolin in a call on Tuesday, the Russian foreign ministry said. Parolin had expressed concern about the situation in Ukraine, the ministry said in a statement. Lavrov ""outlined the principled Russian position regarding the causes and goals of the special military operation being carried out in Ukraine"", it said. Both parties expressed hope that a fourth round of talks between Moscow and Kyiv would be held as soon as possible to agree on the main problems underlying the crisis and to stop hostilities, the ministry added. The Vatican did not release a statement on the call. Ukraine has said it would welcome Vatican mediation and Parolin, who ranks second to Pope Francis in the Vatican hierarchy, has said it is willing to ""facilitate"" dialogue"". Parolin has said the war was ""unleashed by Russia"". Francis has not yet blamed Russia by name but implicitly rejected Moscow's use of the term ""special military operation"" for its invasion of Ukraine.

3/8/2022,"After Katelyn Samples posted a photo of her 10-month-old son on Instagram, a stranger sent her a message with an unnerving question: Had her boy been diagnosed with uncombable hair syndrome? Syndrome. Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. Samples focused on that word. The worries about Locklan came quickly then: Was there something wrong with him? Was he in pain? ""I'd never heard of it,"" the 33-year-old mother in Roswell, Ga., told The Washington Post in an interview. ""I kind of freaked out."" Although she took him to his pediatrician, uncombable hair syndrome is so rare - scientists know of only about 100 cases, according to WebMD - that the doctor hadn't heard of it, either, forcing the Samples family to visit a specialist in Atlanta. A pathologist there confirmed the Instagram stranger's hunch by diagnosing Locklan with uncombable hair syndrome, or UHS. Samples's fear dissipated; Locklan was not in danger or pain. Uncombable hair syndrome is a rare genetic condition that shows up in children between the ages of 3 months and 12 years, according to the National Institutes of Health and WebMD. The genetic abnormality produces dry, frizzy locks that are silvery-blond or straw-colored. The hair sticks out from the scalp and can't be combed flat. Video: Trump says shower head choice is important to making his hair 'perfect' Samples said that each strand of Locklan's hair has a ""crimp"" in it. ""It can't be tamed,"" she said. ""Nothing can fix it."" In the six months since Locklan's diagnosis, Samples started an Instagram account dedicated to her now 17-month-old boy and his hair - ""uncombable_locks,"" the brainchild of her husband, Caleb. Her ambition is threefold: encourage people to embrace what makes them different, urge those who might have uncombable hair syndrome to get diagnosed so scientists can better understand it, and provide information she wishes she'd had when that stranger first mentioned the condition. ""Because there's not a lot of confirmed diagnosis out there, there's in turn not a lot of information,"" she told The Post. When Samples first started scouring the Internet for details, one of the best resources she found was a Facebook group dedicated to the condition. Veteran UHS parents and people with it have shared tidbits about what could happen to Locklan's hair as he gets older, what hairstyles have worked for them and their favorite products. ""That has been extremely helpful,"" she said. "" . . . It's been comforting."" Samples said her efforts to inform others about UHS and encourage people to seek diagnoses are working. Parents from around the world are sending pictures of their children's hair almost every day, wondering if it's the byproduct of UHS. The photos have come from as close as within Georgia and as far away as Ireland, England, Poland and Australia. One mom, after her brother sent her a news article about Samples and Locklan, had her son diagnosed with UHS. The women have developed a friendship. ""We've been able to connect, which has been really cool,"" she said. Aside from the syndrome, Locklan is developing normally, she said. The only possible symptom is his ""extremely sensitive skin,"" something she said other UHS parents in the Facebook group had encountered. She's also read that some children diagnosed with the syndrome can overheat, something she's noticed in Locklan, although she's not sure whether it's tied to his condition. Locklan's hair gets a lot of attention when he's in public, Samples said. People are curious and nearly everyone is ""just filled with joy and extremely kind,"" Samples said. Some even ask to take photos with him, which Samples is fine with ""as long as the baby is happy and vibing with it."" ""For the most part, it's been very, very positive,"" she said.

3/8/2022,"The first foreign fighters have arrived in Ukraine amid heavy Russian bombardment and are on the battlefield, Ukraine military officials tell Military Times. This marks the first time the unit has been used, Ukraine Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of that nation’s defense intelligence agency, told Military Times Monday afternoon. Late last month, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy created “The International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine,” as a global appeal for foreigners to come to the aid of his country. “The first groups are already in the battlefield,” said another Ukraine official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to explain the situation. “A new group goes to the combat area every day.” They have arrived from the U.S., U.K., Sweden, Lithuania, Mexico, India and other countries, said the official. Volunteer fighters arrive in Ukraine. But the untrained should stay home The official did not know all the tasks they are performing, but said some are defending Kyiv. “It is difficult to speak with them as they are in the combat area,” the official said, estimating that worldwide, about 20,000 people have expressed interest in volunteering. Last week, a Ukrainian defense official in Washington D.C. said about 3,000 Americans expressed interest, including many veterans. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby urged Americans to stay home. “I don’t have an estimate of Americans who might want to be volunteering to go there,” he said. “I would say what I said last week, if you’re an American and you want to do right by Ukraine, the best thing you can do is find a way to donate to so many agencies that are trying to deal with what is now clearly a humanitarian crisis in the region, and certainly there in Ukraine. We still do not believe that Ukraine is a safe place for Americans to go. We urge them not to go and if any are still there, we urge them to leave.” The U.S. State Department also recommends citizens not travel to Ukraine. Russia’s war on Ukraine, now in its 12th day, has seen the invading forces slowed, but Ukraine’s cities are experiencing a devastating barrage of aircraft and missile strikes. This is an effort to help shore up Ukrainian forces. Want to go fight for Ukraine? Here’s what to do. No volunteers will be allowed to bring their own weapons, a Ukrainian official told Military Times last week. Those who fight will be issued at least rifles, he added. He would not comment on whether they will be issued other types of weapons. Ukraine officials stress to Military Times that they are looking for foreign volunteers with combat experience who require little training before being armed and sent to the front line. The instructions for joining the legion require “documents confirming military service or work with law enforcement agencies and participation in combat.” “We are asking for trained people to come,” said the official in Ukraine. “We don’t have time for training.”",World/Air Force Times,Foreign fighters now on battlefield helping battle Russia: Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/foreign-fighters-now-battlefield-helping-214733078.html
3/8/2022,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine is 'not going particularly well' and the Kremlin is 'getting more desperate' as Vladimir Putin's troops feel 'let down' by their leaders, a minister has claimed. Western officials believe Putin had hoped to have Ukraine well under his control within days of launching the invasion, but say poor planning, bad leadership and a fierce line of resistance from the Ukrainian people have stalled the Russian progress. The US defence office has claimed Russia has deployed nearly all the 150,000 troops who were stationed on the border, but has only ""made little progress"". An unnamed official added the Russians are ""frustrated by a stiff Ukrainian resistance as well as their own internal challenges"". The nation's largest cities are still under Ukrainian control, but coming under constant Russian bombardment as Putin's force step-up their campaign of misery. Speaking to Sky News, UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said: ""Well it's not going particularly well for the Russians, it's day 13, way off their timetable.  Read more: Russia says military action will stop immediately if Ukraine agrees to four conditions Ben Wallace said Russian soldiers are dying on ""large scales"" and are getting more desperate in their tactics. ""On one level sadly there's lots of casualties, we've seen the indiscriminate shelling which has killed numerous civilians. ""We've also recognised that probably the biggest casualties so far in the war are Russian military soldiers who have been let down by appalling leaders, appalling leadership and appalling plans, and now you see them literally at large scales dying."" On Wednesday, Russia admitted for the first time admitted it had suffered heavy losses, saying in a statement 498 of its troops had died. The UK has said the death toll will be “considerably higher” than figures released by the Kremlin. Ukrainian officials have claimed over 9,000 Russian soldiers have died. The figure has not been independently verified. Read more: Putin isn't insane and won't use nuclear weapons, says ex-Russian foreign minister ""I think that is something that will be seen in the Kremlin, whether they will admit to each other the failure of their aggressive and illegal invasion of Ukraine,"" Wallace added. A 40-mile-convoy of around 15,000 soldiers has been spotted outside of Kyiv for days now, but has stalled, reportedly due to supply issues. Wallace added: ""We've seen the column is still stuck north of Kyiv, there are reports overnight of Ukrainian special forces destroying over 20 Russian helicopters and I think we can see that Russia have a real logistic problem. Watch: Lviv mayor calls for global help to feed refugees The mayor of Lviv calls for international help because the city in far western Ukraine is struggling to feed and house the thousands of people who have fled there from war-torn regions of the country. ""That affects morale, they're getting more desperate and you can see them getting more desperate because they're shelling more and more innocent people, they're trying even to get out on humanitarian corridors as we saw yesterday ""I think this goes right to the heart of the challenge that Russia has built itself a trap and the international community has united against them and we're seeing the devastation that it's leaving behind."" Russia's invasion has sparked the largest humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War Two. The UN's latest figures have say 2 million refugees have fled their homes and gone into neighbouring countries for safety. The capital of Kyiv and second-largest city of Kharkiv still remain under the control of the Ukrainians but have come under severe shelling from Russian forces. International attention has turned to the town of Irpin in recent days, after Putin's troops shelled humanitarian corridors which had opened up for people to evacuate. It comes after the Kremlin laid out four conditions which it demands for the war to come to an end.
