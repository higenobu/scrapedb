1/24/2022,"Investors will focus on Q4 earnings for stocks that are economically sensitive, which should show better profits than technology stocks. Increasing Treasury yields and risk aversion could also hit the stock market hard next week, making the big tech earnings that much more critical. In addition, investors will closely monitor the latest news on the rapidly spread Omicron coronavirus variant in order to see how it impacts earnings in 2022. The following is a list of earnings slated for release January 24-28, along with a few previews. Monday (January 24) Tuesday (January 25) Wednesday (January 26) Thursday (January 27) Friday (January 28) Earnings Calendar For The Week Of January 24 IN THE SPOTLIGHT: IBM The Armonk, New York-based technology company, International Business Machines, is expected to report its fourth-quarter earnings of $3.39 per share, which represents year-over-year growth of over 60% from $2.07 per share seen in the same period a year ago. The world’s largest computer firm’s revenue would decline over 21% to $1.96 billion from $20.37 billion a year earlier. It is worth noting that the technology company has beaten earnings in most of the quarters in the last two years, at least. “International Business Machines (IBM) 4Q earnings will be focused on standalone model mechanics and whether Software revenue can re-accelerate while Consulting demand sustains. However, we believe the setup becomes more attractive in 2H21. We update our estimates to reflect IBM standalone post-KD spin,” noted Katy Huberty, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

The world’s largest software maker would post revenue growth of nearly 17% to around $50.3 billion. It is worth noting that with a track record of always beating earnings per share estimates in the last five years, Microsoft is one of the best FAANG stocks in terms of earnings surprises. “We model Azure growth of 45% cc & see 2-3% of upside, translating to steady growth vs. 48% last qtr. We see potential for strong M365 demand ahead of price hikes, as well as continued execution from LNKD, PowerApps & Dynamics ERP. Although tougher PC/Server dynamics, we expect strengthening trends for C22. Expect Mar Q guide slightly above Street,” noted Derrick Wood, equity analyst at Cowen.

At around 7:30 pm GMT on Wednesday, Jerome Powell will conduct a press conference. This is expected to be the biggest market event since investors expect more details about the central bank’s plan to raise interest rates. INTEL: The California-based multinational corporation and technology company is expected to report its fourth-quarter earnings of $0.9 per share, which represents a year-over-year decline of about 40% from $1.52 per share seen in the same period a year ago. The company’s revenue would fall nearly 8% to $18.39 billion. “Intel remains controversial. Long-term skepticism remains and share losses will continue until products ramp on the Intel 4 node (old 7nm), but with a new CFO, improving PC and server market outlooks, cash inflows from the US Govt, Mobileye on the horizon, and a February analyst day now reconfirmed, we are cautiously optimistic sentiment can continue to gradually improve. Still LOTS to prove,” noted Matthew D. Ramsay, equity analyst at Cowen. TESLA: The California-based electric vehicle and clean energy company is expected to report its fourth-quarter earnings of $2.31 per share, which represents year-over-year growth of 180% from $0.80 per share seen in the same period a year ago. “Q4 results on 26 Jan are critical to validate (or not) the Q3 profit dynamics that could see Tesla 1) carve out meaningful share from legacy OEMs busy protecting their own share by ramping up BEVs and 2) claim a disproportionate share of the industry profit pool. We raise 2021-23 EBIT and FCF 10%, mostly on higher volume,” noted Philippe Houchois, equity analyst at Jefferies. The high-performance electric vehicle manufacturer would post revenue growth of over 50% to $16.65 billion. The electric vehicle producer has beaten earnings estimates only twice in the last four quarters. “Tesla 4Q deliveries were 20% above our forecast, annualizing to over 1.2mm units, which is already above our prior FY22 forecast. We raise our forecasts and target to $1,300 on this ‘opening act’ and look for more in FY22,” noted Adam Jonas, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

The iPhone manufacturer would post revenue growth of 6% to $118.13 billion. It is worth noting that with a track record of always beating earnings per share estimates in the recent five years, Apple is the best FAANG stock in terms of earnings surprises. “Apple is expected to report 1QFY22 earnings after market on Thursday, January 27th and host a call with investors at 5:00 PM ET. In our view, the recent strength in shares is a reflection of investors’ willingness to reward Apple for entering new markets, including electronic vehicles (EV) and the metaverse (with an augmented reality/virtual reality product). Now, we look for comments from management on its future product roadmap to justify the increase in share price,” noted Tom Forte, Senior Research Analyst at D.A. DAVIDSON. “We are reiterating our BUY rating for Apple (AAPL) and putting our price target of $175 under review ahead of the company reporting 1QFY22 earnings.” VISA: The world’s largest card payment company is expected to report its fiscal firth-quarter earnings of $1.70 per share, which represents a year-over-year decline of about 20% from $1.42 per share seen in the same period a year ago. The global technology payment company would post revenue growth of nearly 19% to $6.8 billion. It is worth noting that the company has beaten earnings in most of the quarters in the last two years, at least. “Visa (V) is one of our preferred stocks, as it is a key beneficiary of resilient global consumer spend growth, the ongoing shift from cash to electronic payments, and broadening merchant acceptance. Global Personal Consumption Expenditure and secular growth drivers should support low double-digit revenue growth in the near-to-medium term,” noted James Faucette, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley. “While Covid-19 headwinds are likely to persist, we see upside opportunity from the faster-than-expected recovery of travel. Continued investment in longer-term initiatives (faster payments, P2P, B2B) and partnerships continue to increase its TAM and offer an opportunity for compounding double-digit earnings growth for the foreseeable future.” TAKE A LOOK AT OUR EARNINGS CALENDAR FOR THE FULL RELEASES FOR THE JANUARY 27 TICKER COMPANY EPS FORECAST AOS A.O.

1/24/2022,"After a volatile week of trading in markets last week, investors will be anxiously awaiting fresh commentary from the Federal Reserve and major corporate earnings results from tech giants Microsoft and Apple.  The Federal Reserve's January monetary policy meeting is set to begin Tuesday, with a new monetary statement and press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell to follow on Wednesday.  This month's meeting is expected to produce virtually no immediate changes to monetary policy, but will set the groundwork for an initial interest rate hike in two months, many market participants expect. ""I think at this point, it's very clear that the first rate hike will be at the March meeting. So I think as we look at the January meeting — which is likely to produce very little or zero, quite frankly, in policy terms — what investors and what we're going to be looking at is really just the language around inflation,"" Jason Ware, Albion Financial Group Partner, told Yahoo Finance Live last week. ""At the end of the day, inflation is what's driving Fed policy at least over the medium term."" ""They feel like they've checked the box on their full employment mandate. I think we largely agree with that assessment. But inflation is the big question for 2022,"" he added. ""And if we start to see disinflation as we work through this year — which is our base case view — that might give the Fed a little bit more cover to not raise rates, as the market's now saying, about four times. We think it might be more like two or three times if we do see that disinflation take hold."" The Fed's last monetary statement from December signaled the central bank was inclined to pick up the pace of its asset-purchase tapering process and prepare for an initial interest rate hike, bringing benchmark rates above their current near-zero levels. Shifts on both of these policies would mean removing key accommodative tools that had helped support the virus-stricken U.S. economy — and propped up asset prices — over the course of the pandemic.  The Fed's projections from December suggested that central bank officials would raise interest rates three times this year. But in the weeks since, much of the economic data has made the case for a more aggressively hawkish positioning from the Fed: Consumer prices have risen by the most in 40 years, and the unemployment rate improved far more than expected to reach a fresh pandemic-era low at the end of 2021 as labor market conditions tightened further.  Against this backdrop, even typically ""dovish"" members of the Federal Reserve have signaled they saw the case for hastening the timing of liftoff on interest rates. Fed Governor Lael Brainard told the Senate Banking Committee during her nomination hearing to become Fed Vice Chair earlier this month that the Fed would likely ""be in a position [to raise rates] as soon as asset purchases are terminated,"" with the end of the asset-purchase tapering program currently on track to end in March. ""The January FOMC meeting should continue the Fed's hawkish policy pivot by signaling that it will soon be appropriate to begin removing accommodation,"" Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Matthew Luzzetti wrote in a note on Friday. ""On the policy rate, the meeting statement and Chair Powell's press conference should confirm that liftoff is likely in March. Though Powell may hint that the median expectation for three rate hikes this year (December SEP) has edged higher, it will be difficult to signal more tightening relative to current market pricing of a little over four hikes."" Moreover, the Fed's January statement and press conference could provide more information about the central bank's other tightening tool, or its balance sheet, Luzzetti added. The Fed's December meeting minutes showed some central bank officials thought it would soon be appropriate to begin rolling assets off the Fed's balance sheet, which currently stands at nearly $9 trillion. This suggestion at quantitative tightening (QT) and removing liquidity from the financial system sent markets into a tailspin earlier this month.  ""At this point, the Fed has provided little clarity about the specific parameters of quantitative tightening (QT), other than it will be earlier and faster than the last time,"" Luzzetti said. ""While it is likely too early to provide precise details in these areas, Powell could begin to socialize some of the possible ranges of outcomes to the market, in order to anchor expectations.""  Quarterly earnings season is set to ramp up this week, offering another potential catalyst for the names reporting and for the broader markets, as investors monitor profit growth at some of the biggest corporations and index components. Big Tech earnings from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) will be a major focus this week, with the two companies reporting on Tuesday and Thursday after market close, respectively.  For Microsoft, the report will come following news of the company's biggest-ever acquisition last week, with the tech juggernaut purchasing video game-maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI) for about $69 billion in cash. The move is set to make Microsoft the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue, after Tencent and Sony. And as CEO Satya Nadella said in the press statement announcing the deal, it would also help lay the foundation for Microsoft to begin developing in the metaverse.  For Microsoft's latest quarterly results, however, growth in its cloud computing Azure platform will remain the key focus. In Microsoft's last quarter, Azure grew by another impressive 50% on a year-over-year basis, though Wall Street expects this to slow slightly to about 46% growth for the fiscal second quarter, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill. A broader deceleration may also be included in Microsoft's guidance, given the strength in demand Microsoft and other tech giants experienced over the course of the pandemic.  ""Comps get hard as it moves through the year,"" Thill said in a note last week. Microsoft's revenue grew 22% in the fiscal first quarter, ""and that will be hard to sustain as it approaches a $200B+ rev base,"" Thill added.  Peer tech giant Apple is also set to report results, offering a look at how the company navigated supply chain challenges to meet demand for its newest hardware including the iPhone 13. Consensus analysts expect Apple grew revenue 7% over last year in its fiscal first quarter that ended in December, to bring sales to a quarterly record of $119.3 billion. Still, that growth rate would mark a significant deceleration from the 21% growth posted in the same quarter last year, and the 29% increase from Apple's quarter ended in September.  Supply chain snarls and chip shortages had been a key concern weighing on Apple at the end of last year, driving the company to slash its iPhone 13 production targets for last year by millions of units, Bloomberg reported in October last year. The company also reportedly told suppliers that iPhone 13 demand had weakened leading up to the holidays, according to a separate Bloomberg report from December. And Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri had said in late October that the company would likely see a more than $6 billion revenue hit due to supply chain constraints for its December quarter.  Still, some Wall Street analysts struck an upbeat tone on Apple's prospects after a difficult second half of 2021.   ""Our checks indicated the supply chain improved on a month-over-month basis throughout the quarter,"" UBS analyst David Voigt wrote in a note last week. ""In addition, our analysis of global availability/wait times suggests the mix continues to skew towards higher-end models like the Pro and Max as consumers appear increasingly likely to spend upwards of $1,000 on an iPhone given significant subsidies available in key markets like the U.S."" ""Although we expect iPhone upside in the quarter, lingering supply chain disruptions have likely pushed some sell-through into the March quarter,"" he added.  Monday: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (0.37 in November); Markit U.S. Manufacturing PMI, January preliminary (56.8 expected, 57.7 in December); Markit U.S. Services PMI, January preliminary (54.8 expected, 57.6. in December); Markit.
