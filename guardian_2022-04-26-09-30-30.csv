4/26/2022,"Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has claimed that there remains a “real” danger of a third world war, in interviews with Russian media, though he said peace talks would continue and an accord would be signed at some point. He said deliveries of western weaponry to Ukraine meant the Nato alliance was “in essence engaged in war with Russia”. About 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since the start of the invasion, the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace has said. Speaking in parliament on Monday afternoon, he added that 2,000 armoured vehicles had been destroyed or captured, including 530 tanks. Russia is believed to have lost more than 60 helicopters and fighter jets. The UK will send a small number of Stormer missile launching vehicles to Ukraine, and the overall amount of military aid could rise to £500m ($637m). The UK has sent 5,361 light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs) and 200 Javelin anti-armour missiles, and will provide 250 Starstreak anti-air missiles. Five railway stations in central and western Ukraine were hit by Russian airstrikes in the space of one hour on Monday. Oleksander Kamyshin, the head of Ukrainian Railways, said five train stations came under fire causing an unspecified number of casualties, as most of Ukraine was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning. Russia should be “weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine”, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said after he and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, visited Kyiv and pledged a further $713m to help Ukraine in its war effort. Blinken said Russia was “failing” in its war aims, while Ukraine was succeeding. He added that the US had put in place a strategy of “massive support for Ukraine, massive pressure against Russia” from across Nato. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had expelled 40 German diplomatic staff in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had taken the decision after Germany declared a “significant number” of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin “undesirable” on 4 April. A senior Russian diplomat has been quoted as saying that a ceasefire in Ukraine would not be “a good option” and claimed that Kyiv may use it to “stage provocations”. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the UN, said: “Ukraine is undermining our efforts to open humanitarian corridors so we don’t think a ceasefire is a good option now.” The Ukrainian defence ministry said the shelling of a government building in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria was a “planned provocation” by Russia. “Obviously, this case is one of a number of provocative measures organised by the FSB [the Russian security service] to instil panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment,” the ministry’s defence intelligence department said, according to CNN. Sweden and Finland have agreed to submit simultaneous membership applications to the US-led Nato alliance as early as the middle of next month, local media have reported. The story was broken by the Finnish newspaper Iltalehti, and Swedish government sources appeared to confirm the news to domestic media. A statue in Kyiv erected to show solidarity between Ukraine and Russia is to be taken down, according to the city’s mayor. The bronze statue showing two workers standing stand by side will be dismantled on Tuesday. A second sculpture will be covered up. They were both installed in 1982 and lie underneath the People Friendship Arch near the Dnieper River. The office of the prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) has joined an EU-backed team investigating crimes in Ukraine in an unprecedented move.

4/26/2022,"Free media in Hong Kong has been almost completely dismantled by the government crackdown, clearing the market for an expanded pro-Beijing and state-owned media sector, a new report has said. The report, by UK-based advocacy group Hong Kong Watch, came shortly after Hong Kong’s Foreign Correspondent’s Club announced it was suspending its Human Rights Press Awards because it did not want to unintentionally violate the city’s wide-ranging national security law imposed in 2020 by Beijing. The working environment for local and foreign journalists in Hong Kong has become increasingly difficult, the report said, detailing the widespread use of “lawfare” against journalists – including with the national security law – acts of intimidation and police violence, mass sackings, and government intervention or censorship of outlets. It noted the redefinition by police of who constituted a journalist, the pending introduction of a fake news law, and the criminalising of traditional research methods. Since the 2019 pro-democracy protests, a crackdown has seen the closure of Apple Daily, Stand News and others. Sources and citizens now fear retribution or legal consequences for speaking to journalists. A government intervention into RTHK has stripped the public broadcaster of its former editorial independence, and a chilling effect has spread across remaining media, with some engaging in alarming self-censorship. In one example, Chris Wong – a former news presenter with the TVB broadcaster – described to Hong Kong Watch his attempts to report on the November 2019 attack on pro-democracy councillor Andrew Chiu, whose ear was bitten off. The attack was evidenced by clear photographs and video, the report noted. “The script that the editor provided said that Mr Chiu’s ear fell off naturally, somehow,” Wong said. “Nobody did anything, it was not a bite, and the ear just fell to the floor. The editors did not want to cover violence by pro-Beijing ‘blue’ supporters.” Wong also said they were ordered to call protesters “black shirts” and to not cover their press conferences, while running those by the police in full. “Unfortunately, TVB damaged the reputation of its journalists, and because of TVB’s reputation, all former employees are living and working under a lot of public criticism.” The report also detailed multiple acts of police violence against journalists during the protests, including some which appeared targeted. “We were sitting on the ground, and we had taken off our gear, our masks and helmets and other protective gear,” a South China Morning Post photojournalist said of covering one protest. “The police came and sprayed teargas directly at us. The hatred that the police showed against the media was shocking.” The silencing and intimidation of Hong Kong’s media scene had been helped by pro-Beijing outlets which now benefited from the reduced industry, the report suggested. “In the absence of pro-democracy media, it is worth pausing here to consider the implications of the erosion of press freedom and how it creates further space for the pro-Beijing media,” the report said, accusing the outlets of “providing propaganda for the Chinese Communist party regime and the Hong Kong government, and threatening their critics, both in print and through various forms of harassment.” “I think we have seen an emboldening of them,” said Hong Kong Watch director, Benedict Rogers, noting recent moves by Ta Kung Pao to devote entire pages to attacking the church, church-run schools, Hong Kong Cardinal Joseph Zen, and Hong Kong Watch. “That struck me as a kind of escalation and emboldening. They’ve always from time to time gone after people like me and people in Hong Kong but I’ve never seen full page spreads.” The report also noted the claims of former Stand News editor and chair of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, Ronson Chan, that he was tailed by a Ta Kung Pao reporter before the paper published a front page story accusing him of visiting a sex worker. In March 2020 Ta Kung Pao published a list of artists and arts organisations it said were linked to anti-government activists, including the artist Kacey Wong who later fled to Taiwan. The report also accused the papers of publishing “propaganda” including descriptions of the 2021 vote for the legislative council, as “the most successful since handover” despite a historically low voter turnout of about 30%. The general public for now can still get news from remaining free media and international outlets, Rogers said, “but in terms of Chinese language local media they really have a much much narrower choice and the danger then is they’re getting info filtered through the lens of Beijing’s propaganda.” In the report Hong Kong Watch called for international governments to offer pathways and assistance to fleeing Hong Kong journalists who want to emigrate, and to continue Cantonese language media from overseas. It also called for governments to use Magnitsky-style sanctions and other forms of pressure to encourage the Hong Kong government to restore media freedoms. “The international community must not allow those responsible for these violations to get away with impunity and without consequence,” it said.",News/World news,Free media in Hong Kong almost completely dismantled – report ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/free-media-in-hong-kong-almost-completely-dismantled-report
4/26/2022,"David Cameron and a right-leaning thinktank have warned the government to defend its flagship counter-extremism strategy from criticisms or risk enabling terrorism. In a controversial report from Policy Exchange, the former prime minister has demanded a robust defence of the Prevent strategy. The report claims that Prevent is being undermined by “Islamist campaigners and their allies” and names organisations including CAGE and the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). Its release comes after Priti Patel has indicated she wishes to overhaul the strategy in the wake of the murder of the Conservative MP Sir David Amess. An ongoing independent review of Prevent by William Shawcross has been delayed, but is expected to report its findings later this year. In a foreword to the report, Cameron warns: “Just as we need to counter the Islamist extremist narrative, we need to counter the anti-Prevent narrative. We need to show that delegitimising counter-terrorism is, in essence, enabling terrorism.” The report goes on to condemn Muslim groups that have criticised Prevent. “Unopposed, activists have been feeding the national media, and targeting Muslim communities themselves, creating a grievance culture that argues they are victims of Prevent, which they claim is an ‘Islamophobic’ social engineering project.” A spokesperson for the MCB said Policy Exchange has consistently led efforts to discourage cooperation between the authorities and the Muslim Council of Britain. “It is therefore laughable that the Policy Exchange should now claim that we are the ones discouraging cooperation because we are exercising our democratic responsibility to scrutinise bad policy. “The MCB has always repeatedly and loudly opposed all forms of terrorism, but the Policy Exchange’s amnesia fails to acknowledge this,” she said. Muhammad Rabbani, managing director of CAGE, said:“The report stands as a testament to the unified resilience of Muslim organisations, against all odds, in effectively defending their communities from one of the most pernicious and insidious government policies, that is Prevent. “Despite the government having a near absolute monopoly on power and access to mainstream media and PR agencies, the report promotes a false reality of ‘unopposed activists’ critiquing Prevent in order to explain away communities’ wholesale rejection of Prevent.” There have been calls for an independent review of the strategy for years, by critics who say it fosters discrimination against people of Muslim faith or backgrounds and inhibits legitimate expression. The Prevent strategy includes a statutory duty for schools, NHS trusts, prisons and local authorities to report any concerns they have about people who may be at risk of turning to extremism. It has led to cases in which teachers have reported primary schoolchildren to the police for having toy guns or talking about video games. A coalition of more than 450 Islamic organisations, including 350 mosques and imams, boycotted the government’s review of Prevent last March in protest against the appointment of Shawcross. Shawcross, who chaired the Charity Commission between 2012 and 2018, has been criticised as a result of previous remarks he has made about Islam.",News/Politics,David Cameron says government should defend its counter-extremism strategy,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/26/david-cameron-says-government-should-defend-its-counter-extremism-strategy
4/26/2022,"Children as young as between three and six years old are becoming the latest victims in a growing trend of self-generated child sexual abuse, a report from an internet safety watchdog has said. The Internet Watch Foundation said over a one month period it saw 51 examples of self-generated abuse imagery – where children are manipulated into recording their own abuse before it is shared online – including a child aged between three and six. More than half of the cases involved a sibling or friend of the child. “Such young children being subjected to this kind of abuse is an emerging phenomenon – it is not something we have really seen before and this is the first time we have produced definitive data on it,” said Susie Hargreaves, IWF chief executive. “Our frontline analysts are now seeing younger and younger children being approached, groomed and coerced by predators online.” The IWF, which operates a UK hotline but also reports on instances of child sexual abuse material [CSAM] around the world, said the self-generated content is created using webcams or smartphones and then distributed on a number of platforms. It said two-thirds of the reports, which were registered between 11 October and 10 November last year, were either duplicated images or videos, or contained the same children appearing more than once. “In some cases, children are groomed, deceived or extorted into producing and sharing a sexual image or video of themselves. The images are created of children often in their bedrooms or another room in a home setting and no abuser is physically present but may be present virtually via the internet,” said the IWF. The IWF said the instances of self-generated CSAM for three to six year olds showed the young victims “performing” as if in a show. “It’s evident this is not the first time this has happened to them and they are obviously trying to ‘please’ an audience, unaware of the inappropriateness being asked of them,” said the IWF. It added: “In many of the videos, phones can be heard buzzing and the children then pause to read and carry out a different request, often not hesitating at what is being asked of them.” The IWF said several images and videos appeared to show children intently looking into the camera, presumably to read or view something and then replicate it. The findings were included in IWF’s annual report, which underline the predominance of self-generated images in CSAM cases. It said 2021 was its worst year on record for child sexual abuse online as it reported 252,000 URLs containing images or videos of children – people under the age of 18 – being sexually abused, compared with 153,000 in the previous year. Of that total, there were 182,000 instances of self-generated material, with the biggest age group within that segment being 11 to 13 year olds, where there were 148,000 reports. “As recently as six years ago, we were seeing so-called self-generated material beginning to emerge as a threat. Now it is not only a regular thing we see – it is prevalent,” said Hargreaves.",News/Society,Children between three and six ‘victims of self-generated child sexual abuse’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/26/children-between-three-and-six-victims-of-self-generated-child-sexual-abuse-internet-watch-foundation
4/26/2022,"Unions have called for a commercial and consumer boycott of P&O Ferries, which is facing a fresh row over crew pay even as its sailings are set to resume on the Dover-Calais route. The TUC urged freight firms and holidaymakers not to book on P&O Ferries, which broke the law when it sack nearly 800 crew last month, while the RMT union said it had evidence that agency workers brought in to replace those staff were being paid less than minimum wage. “We have seen contracts of agency workers where they are being paid the equivalent of £4.35 an hour for 17 weeks work,” the RMT said. “This is less than half the current UK national minimum wage.” The affected crew were on the Spirit of Britain, one of the Dover-based ferries, which has now been passed fit to sail after originally failing an inspection. That means sailings will resume this week, potentially as early as Tuesday, for lorries, with leisure travellers expected to be able to board the ferries next week. P&O Ferries denied that they had cut pay and said it was an “administrative misunderstanding”, but the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said it had investigated and upheld a complaint from the RMT. The union said a crew member had alerted them saying he was “desperate” for help after his pay was apparently reduced by £195 on a new contract. A P&O Ferries spokesperson said the individual had been “unaware of an appendix which included made clear that he would be entitled to an additional £195 a month, meaning that there was no change in his overall pay”. The spokesperson said: “There are no plans to change or reduce the wages of any of our agency seafarers and we have made clear that we will continue to comply fully with any national minimum wage obligations introduced by the UK government.” The MCA said: “The complaint made by the RMT union about seafarers’ welfare and employment contracts was fully investigated as part of the reinspection of Spirit of Britain and upheld.” The RMT’s general secretary Mick Lynch said: “Staffing ships with super-exploited agency staff is not just morally wrong, it undercuts those remaining ferry operators who do abide by union rates of pay and conditions and undermines passenger safety.” The TUC called for a public and commercial boycott of P&O Ferries and its owner DP World, the Dubai-owned group that also has lucrative government contracts to run the port of Southampton and the London Thames Gateway freeport. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: “P&O and DP World must not be allowed to get away with their scandalous and unlawful treatment of staff. “Companies who behave like corporate gangsters deserve far more than a slap on the wrist. Ministers must sever all commercial ties with P&O and its owner DP World and ensure they do not receive a single penny of taxpayers’ money.” She said that the scandal showed UK employment law was “not fit for purpose” and called on the government to bring forward an employment bill to strengthen workers’ rights. The president of the Scottish TUC, Pat Rafferty, went further by saying P&O Ferries’ chief executive should be put in jail. Rafferty told the STUC conference in Aberdeen: “Peter Hebblethwaite should be struck off the directors register and put behind bars.” Hebblethwaite admitted in a Commons hearing that P&O had failed to consult staff or give proper notification of the move to the UK government or flag states, breaking employment law. The firm is now under criminal investigation by the Insolvency Service. Sailings have now resumed on most of P&O Ferries’ routes around the UK. Another vessel, the European Highlander, was passed by the MCA and returned to service on Saturday, bringing the Larne-Cairnryan route linking Northern Ireland and Scotland back to full capacity. P&O Ferries have not sailed on the major route between Britain and Europe, the Dover-Calais crossing, since it suspended services on 17 March to make 786 crew redundant.",News/Business,Unions call for P&O Ferries boycott for allegedly paying staff less than minimum wage,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/26/unions-call-for-po-ferries-boycott-for-allegedly-paying-below-minimum-wage
4/26/2022,"The schools watchdog Ofsted is to increase its focus on early-years education as part of its new five-year strategy, to address the devastating impact of the pandemic on some of the youngest children in England. Ofsted is concerned that children in early years are lagging behind in their communication and language skills owing to Covid disruption, while the sector is under pressure as thousands of staff have left since the first lockdown and childcare providers are down by 5,000. In its new 2022-27 strategy published on Tuesday, Ofsted says it intends to increase training for its early-years inspection workforce as part of making this sector a strategic priority. The watchdog is also promising to work with the government to try to simplify the regulatory regime for childminders. The number of registered childcare providers has dropped from 75,000 at the start of the pandemic to 70,000, with childminders accounting for most of the losses. Ofsted says it also intends to share data and insights about group-owned early-years providers to improve their regulation. The chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said: “We recognise the outstanding work early-years providers have done to help children recover what they missed, and this strategy aims to increase our support for a workforce that is so deeply devoted to what it does. “Whether it is through developing specialist training for our inspection workforce or through sharing our own insights, we will do everything in our power to help every child gain the best start in life.” Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, welcomed Ofsted’s increased focus on the sector. “That said, even with these positive intentions, it’s difficult to see how much actual change Ofsted, as an independent inspection body, will be able to bring about,” he said. “Even before the onset of Covid-19, early-years providers were grappling with a raft of challenges such as staffing shortages and immense financial pressures as a result of years of government underfunding, and there is no doubt that these challenges have been hugely exacerbated by the pandemic, with more and more settings being pushed to the brink of closure.” The 2022-27 strategy also includes plans to accelerate the inspection cycle so that all schools are inspected by July 2025, as detailed in the government’s schools white paper last month. Ofsted has promised to increase the proportion of longer inspections to allow for evidence gathering, and to work with the Department for Education to increase powers to intervene where children are being educated in illegal and unregistered schools. Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said Ofsted’s inspection system needed to be reformed. “At the moment you are far more likely to be judged below good if your school serves a disadvantaged community. This isn’t because your school is necessarily doing anything wrong but because there are some very significant challenges associated with this context, the biggest of which is attracting sufficient numbers of specialist teachers to fill vacancies in the midst of an ongoing recruitment crisis,” she said.",News/Education,Ofsted will step up early-years focus to address lockdown impact,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/26/ofsted-will-step-up-early-years-focus-to-address-lockdown-impact
4/26/2022,"At the end of the last Downton Abbey film, the poor Dowager Countess of Grantham had graciously acknowledged a serious unnamed malady, and there was a solemn overhead crane shot of the stately home against a cosmic starlit sky before the closing credits. It seemed to all of us that this franchise was surely finished. But oh no. Downton is back. Screenwriter Julian Fellowes’s creation has lurched defiantly up from its deathbed for another Charleston around the sick-room and I have to admit – like someone with an empty tube of Pringles in their hand that was full 10 minutes ago – that I did find this film entertaining; more outrageously silly and hammy and artlessly snobby than ever, with some Acorn Antiques-style revelations of paternity shenanigans and gorgeous tailoring for the gentlemen. It is of course several leagues below Fellowes’s original country-house movie – Gosford Park from 2001, directed by Robert Altman - and some plot ideas about the glamorous world of Hollywood movies have in fact been cheekily recycled from that film. And there is another borrowing (cheekier still) from Singin’ in the Rain. All this is something that will (understandably) annoy many, and this film may well try the patience of non-fans. But there is something diverting about the deadly serious melodrama and bizarre glassy-eyed pathos that Downton 2 is serving up. And as ever, there is something intriguing about the way Maggie Smith, when she has to deliver emotional lines – as she occasionally does – sounds less and less posh. The date is around 1928 or possibly 1929, apparently before the Wall Street crash. (But wait: Smith’s character was supposed to be quite old at the beginning of the TV show, which kicked off in 1912!) Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) draws the attention of her crotchety papa, the Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), to the fact that the house’s roof is leaking – so they need cash. There is nothing for it but to accept the offer of money from the ghastly people from what Lord Grantham calls the “kinema”: a film production company that wants to use the house as a location for a new film. The roguishly handsome star Guy Dexter (Dominic West) charms one and all, and appears to have a particular spark with the house’s footman-turned-butler Barrow (Robert James-Collier). Meanwhile, the below-stairs staff are gibbering with excitement about it all and the film’s sensitive and rather wet director Jack Barber (Hugh Dancy) has a tendresse for Lady Mary, who gets them out of a jam. While this is going down, it emerges that the Dowager Countess has been left a villa in the south of France in the will of an ageing French aristocrat with whom she had a dalliance in the previous century. So this rather Mitfordian plot twist means some of the family have to journey to the sun-dappled Côte d’Azur to inspect this gorgeous property on the Countess’s behalf and be confronted by the nobleman’s affronted widow, played by Nathalie Baye. And what exactly did the Dowager Countess of Grantham have to do to get this house? Are we going to get some shockingly CGI-youthified scene of deshabille? Well, it leads to scenes of utter consternation on the part of Lord Grantham – although perhaps only a pedant would wonder why no one thought to find a photograph of the old Marquise. No matter. It is all cheerfully risible although heading for a note of seriousness to compare with what Wagner was aiming for with Siegfried’s Funeral March. I have to hope now that this really is it, and that if Mr Fellowes want to give us more Downton, he will confine it to a streaming TV show, with a new Grantham generation in the 1970s reduced to penury by exorbitant but highly justified rates of tax.

4/26/2022,"At 3:15 at the MCG on Monday, the only sounds were a bawling baby and the Australian, Aboriginal and New Zealand flags flapping at half-mast. As a fan, it’s the one minute where the AFL and its sponsors aren’t trying to flog you something. For the Essendon players, it was a momentary respite from what had been a noisy week. Former players, ex Collingwood coaches, fans, pundits, panellists, professional fault finders – they were climbing out of trees to bag them. The Bombers were too soft. They were too nice. They had no depth. They had no grunt. They had no backline. They had no brand. They had no business playing on Anzac Day. Some of it was warranted. Some of it was plain ridiculous. One newspaper headline read “AFL’s disgraceful acts exposed”. I was half expecting a story about a glassing in a bar. But no, it was David King lamenting Essendon’s lack of midfield pressure. Kane Cornes took exception (you can set your watch to those four words) to the way they laughed with their opponents last Sunday. Mick Malthouse, fresh from tipping them to win the premiership, said they were “pathetic”. In an emotional and historically questionable speech to his former club, he said there was nowhere to hide on Anzac Day. “It’s either victory, or disgrace,” he said. While Old Chuckles was reliving first world war cavalry charges, Essendon had eight days to figure out how to defend as a team, how to apply a modicum of pressure and how to work the locks to a talented Collingwood side. As they lined up to pay their respects however, their problems were on full display. They lacked big, mature bodies. Hooker had retired. Hurley was hobbled. McDonald- Tipungwuti, who kicked five goals in this game last year, was in the reserves. Stringer and Merrett were rushed back in. But many of their teammates looked very slight and very raw. Eight were playing their first Anzac Day match. To their credit, the Bombers responded. They looked like a completely different outfit to the one that barely gave a yelp against the Dockers. They tackled. They harassed. They shed their bruise-free tag. Their ruckman, who looks like something out of Beyond Thunderdome, threw his weight around. Darcy Parish had an astonishing 30 first half possessions, something no footballer has managed this century. But they lacked polish. They couldn’t convert. In the second term in particular, they squandered some easy chances in front of goal. Collingwood, on the other hand, were kicking goals out of their backsides. They had kicked themselves out of the West Coast and Geelong games, but were dead-eyes yesterday. Jack Ginnivan and Brodie Mihocek booted nine goals straight between them. Ginnivan won the medal, but in many ways Scott Pendlebury was the architect. With the game in the balance in the third term, he shifted into the middle and had an immediate impact. He has now had more than 9,000 possessions as a league footballer, and yesterday moved past Gary Ablett Jnr into fourth spot on the all-time list of accumulators. Of those 9,000 touches, you could count the errors on one hand. For possibly the first time in his career, he was run down from behind. As imperturbable as ever, he then helped set up the next three goals. But the story in many ways was Essendon. A lot is expected of them. Their supporters certainly demand a lot. Off-field, they talk a big game. They want to be a powerful club again. “We exist to win premierships,” their chief executive said late last year. Don’t we all, fella. You can release a mission statement every week if you want, but it doesn’t mean a bag of beans if you can’t get your best players on the park, and if the ones who do play are reluctant to defend and tackle. For too long now, they have been a team that only has one plan, one gear, one mode. They’ve been great to watch, but easy to counter. The coach wants them to be a blue-collar side, but for the first five rounds they were anything but. Malthouse reckons that whoever loses on Anzac Day knows nothing but disgrace. But the only disgrace was Mick’s martial metaphors. On Monday, the Bombers were finally willing to get their hands dirty. On Monday, they showed enough to suggest that 2022 is not a complete write-off. The coach insists that they’re still a work in progress, that they’re still figuring out what sort of side they are, and that the football world was perhaps too easily seduced by them last year. He urged patience. After last week’s pile on, the football world may actually take him up on that. For a supporter base that has endured a supplements scandal and years of treading water, it’ll be a slightly harder sell.",Sport/Sport,Essendon bring heat in AFL Anzac Day clash but still lack polish | Jonathan Horn,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/26/essendon-bring-heat-in-afls-anzac-day-clash-but-still-lack-polish
4/26/2022,"‘Let’s make a thriller out of this movie,” suggests Alexei Navalny to his director, Daniel Roher. “And then, if I am killed, you can make a boring movie of memory.” It’s typical of the man: for someone in a situation of such precarity, Navalny seemingly struggles to take anything too seriously. It’s clearly a defence mechanism – and in the circumstances, who can blame him? The alternative might involve surrendering to despair, and that would help no one. And anyway, Navalny has been living on the edge for long enough to be used to it. This startling, terrifying documentary (BBC Two) offers up a potted history of Navalny’s anti-Putin, pro-democracy activism. At times, he seems like a one-man opposition: equal parts politician, provocateur and investigative journalist. He’s not ideologically bound – in fact, there’s an interesting segment where Roher probes his brief, pragmatic-going-on-troubling alliance of convenience with the far right. But mainly, he’s portrayed in the mainstream Russian media as that most dreaded of things: a liberal. Navalny is very much a figure of his era. He namechecked The Wire and enjoyed social media discourse with its creator, David Simon. Much of his most successful work has involved exploiting social media and mobile filming technology, which is partly why his name has spread so far beyond Russia. For Navalny, social media is a weapon and a shield. When, for example, he and his wife, Yulia, board the plane that is returning them to Moscow, he is relieved rather than irritated to be greeted by a forest of filming phones. When you oppose a regime that shrouds its deeds in darkness, there cannot be too much light. But did Navalny overestimate the protection his fame – and people’s fascination with him – was offering? “As I became more famous, I was sure my life was becoming safer. Because it would become problematic for them to kill me.” He pauses for a moment before remarking wryly: “I was very wrong.” Yes he was. Navalny’s 2020 near-death experience occasioned by Russia’s signature nerve agent novichok is the heart of this film. While recovering in Germany, he joins forces with Bellingcat investigative journalist Christo Grozev (“a nice Bulgarian nerd with a laptop”) in an attempt to dig out the facts about his poisoning. What ensues is remarkable – the point at which Navalny enters the realms of the entertaining but far-fetched espionage thriller. With a surprising degree of ease, Grozev and Navalny’s small team uncover the identities of the Federal Security Service (FSB) agents sent to kill him. They even get their phone numbers. And then, Navalny rings them, one by one, to ask why they did it. At first, it doesn’t go well, mainly because Navalny can’t resist saying who he is. The agents simply hang up. Eventually, though, he poses as a Kremlin investigator, looking to explore the reasons for the mission’s failure. Soon enough, one of his would-be assassins is singing like a canary. The ensuing conversation is one of the most jaw-dropping things you’ll ever witness – it’s clearly all in a day’s work for the agent who, as Navalny fights to keep the incredulous glee out of his voice, drones on about dosage, the exact placement of the poison in Navalny’s underpants and the annoyingly quick reactions of the emergency services. “Poor guy,” smirks Navalny at the end of the conversation. “They will kill him.” Navalny’s resistance cell has a small, charmingly ad hoc air about it. But the film brilliantly captures the innate foolishness of his opponents, too – the absurdity as well as the darkness. There is always, in the end, something innately laughable about autocracies – probably because the distortions necessary to sustain their poisonous fictions can eventually only play out as either horror or comedy. At one point, a Kremlin-endorsed talkshow posits liberals’ “endless homosexuality” as an explanation for Navalny’s weakness and near-death. Vladimir Putin goes to ridiculous lengths to avoid even saying Navalny’s name, which, believe it or not, doesn’t cut the mustard as a public power-play. His persona couldn’t seem more of a contrast to Navalny’s robustness – the impression of Putin is overwhelmingly one of fragility and paranoia. In fact, Navalny’s sturdiness is such that it’s faintly surprising when events play out as we know they must. Navalny seems the moral winner throughout. His calm confidence is infectious. But he’s still in prison, facing up to 20 years. Sometimes, sadly, realpolitik trumps narrative justice. The film ends in a darkness that is all the more pronounced for our knowledge of where Putin is about to take Russia and the world. In the end, if this story is a thriller rather than Navalny’s “boring movie of memory”, it will need another chapter to reveal its happy ending. Navalny is available now on BBC iPlayer in the UK and CNN+ in the US. It will be on HBO Max in the US from 26 May.

4/26/2022,"Cabinet ministers have been ordered to come up with new “non-fiscal” ways to combat the cost of living, in a tacit acknowledgment that the government’s spring statement failed to match the enormity of the crisis. Boris Johnson said the government would renew efforts to promote schemes with low take-up, including tax-free childcare of about £2,000 a year that about 1.3m households are yet to claim. About 850,000 eligible households are also not claiming pension credit, which can be worth over £3,300 a year. But Labour said the government needed to go further and that it was now time for an emergency budget to announce new help for struggling families. In a new analysis, the party found that families will fork out an extra £10bn on petrol, compared with just this time last year. Labour’s shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said: “This is a savage extra cost for working people. The Conservative government needs to set out an emergency budget to tackle its cost of living crisis – and support Labour’s call to put money back in the pockets of working people.” The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been firm with departments that there is limited possibility of major further spending. Almost 90% of British households reported an increase in their cost of living last month as they were hit by escalating fuel, food and borrowing costs, according to the Office for National Statistics. It said a quarter of all those in its survey were struggling to pay their bills and 17% had turned to loans or borrowing on credit cards to make ends meet. Sunak, who announced a 5p fuel duty cut as well as raising the limit on the national insurance payment threshold, admitted at his statement last month that households would face the biggest cut in their living standards since the 1950s. The government, which pressed ahead with a national insurance rise to tackle the NHS backlog, has been urged to go further particularly in helping with the cost of energy bills, beyond the £150 council tax rebate. A new targeted communications campaign will highlight areas where people can claim support and Johnson will tell cabinet ministers that he expects a crackdown on private companies profiteering from the crisis. This comes as the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, wrote to Ofgem to urgently look into claims that energy suppliers may be making unjustified increases to consumers’ direct debits. Ahead of cabinet, the prime minister said: “With household bills and living costs rising in the face of global challenges, easing the burden on the British people and growing our economy must be a team effort across Cabinet. “We have a strong package of financial support on offer, worth £22bn, and it’s up to all of us to make sure that help is reaching the hardest-hit and hard-working families across the country. “We will continue to do all we can to support people without letting government spending and debt spiral, whilst continuing to help Brits to find good jobs and earn more, no matter where they live.” Labour has said it would enact five measures now to ease the burden on household budgets. They include a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut home energy bills, including a VAT cut. The party said it would give small and mid-size enterprises a business rates discount with a tax on online giants; scrap the national insurance hike; fund a major upgrade of household insulation; and instruct the National Crime Agency to investigate £11.8bn of Covid fraud and error.",News/Business,Ministers ordered to find new ‘non-fiscal’ ways to combat cost of living,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/25/ministers-ordered-to-find-new-non-fiscal-ways-to-combat-cost-of-living
4/26/2022,"If Piers Morgan were a nightclub bouncer, he would try to start fights. Before the launch of his latest broadcasting career – on Rupert Murdoch’s Talk TV, a screen-led sibling to the tycoon’s Talk Radio and Times Radio – he Twitter-challenged the Guardian to come and take him on if we were stereotypical enough. “The only way the PR campaign for @PiersUncensored could possibly get any better,” Morgan taunted, “is if the @guardian review it and says it’s terrible, unwatchable & the end of civilisation as we know it. Don’t let me down you whiny woke wastrels!” OK then, you preening pugilistic publicist, let’s see what we can do. Startlingly, even for such an established egotist, Morgan started by comparing himself to one of the greatest figures of the 20th century, winner of the Nobel peace prize and the US presidential medal of freedom. “As Nelson Mandela might have said, it’s been a long walk to freedom of speech!” Morgan opened the show, a higher voice than usual suggesting nerves that would have been touching in someone of less industrial self-confidence. Morgan was also cocky about the likely audience: “If [Putin] is watching … and he will be!” A long opening monologue promised the Piers show to herald a TV “no cancel zone” that will be an “island of sanity” in “a world gone mad.” So totalitarian are the “fun police” that someone, like Morgan, who dares to tell the truth has multiple newspaper columns and a new TV station built around him. This splenetic soliloquy also showcased the weakest part of his broadcasting persona: the Jeremy Clarkson tribute act revealed when he is allowed to speak uninterrupted for too long. But, as extensively reported (and not just by himself), Morgan’s debut coup was an interview with Donald Trump, whom the host characteristically introduced as “the most famous and divisive man in the world, present company excepted!” Recorded at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, this fight for the World Heavyweight Orange-Skinned Narcissist title brought publicity and clicks for Talk TV, but lacked news value due to Trump’s current status as an amateur golfer in Florida. As a result, this is the second successive media launch – after Andrew Marr’s move to LBC last month – that would clearly have hoped to kick off by interviewing the prime minister (whether Boris Johnson or a successor). However, the oddity of 10 Downing Street being occupied by a politician who rarely submits to questioning and, if then, by the police meant that Marr opened with Michael Gove and Morgan with Trump. The host has also boasted of his closeness to Joe Biden but, for different reasons of what might come out of his mouth, the president is no more likely to give a long-form interview than Johnson is. Admittedly, Trump is the first defeated White House incumbent since Grover Cleveland in 1888 who might plausibly seek a second term (Cleveland did, and won). The strongest news line Morgan got was a very heavy hint that Trump will have another go, although he might have glossed for viewers that the politician’s refusal to declare at this stage relates, as he hinted, to campaign finance scrutiny that begins on day one of an official race. But then Morgan, not for the first time, seemed more interested in his own contributions than his guest’s: the chat was irritatingly cut into fillets with before and after comments from the presenter, rather than trusted to flow as a conversation. The Sunday papers that trumpeted Talk TV’s debut also featured prominent adverts for Marr’s LBC show. The strikingly similar sales lines – Piers Morgan Uncensored, Marr Gets His Voice Back – imply these shows will sidestep the pettifogging editorial balance the presenters suffered at the BBC and ITV. In fact, both hosts remain subject to Ofcom regulation, as does another big mouth newcomer, GB News, so claims of saying the unsayable are marketing bravado. And, as the regulator cleared Morgan’s Good Morning Britain interviews with government ministers during lockdown – the most forensically offensive ever seen on British television – it is unclear how much further he could go in a studio. The only line drawn at ITV was over his on-air bawling-out of a colleague and subsequent storming from the studio. If Morgan flounces off this set, they’re stuffed, and that is not the only drawback of a solo show. Morgan’s most similar broadcasting venture – his CNN evening talk show from 2011-14 – failed, though that can be attributed to his being viewed in the US as an asshole Brit, only one of which objections applies in the UK. But for all Morgan’s self-obsession, the clear highlight of his TV career – the six years on ITV’s Good Morning Britain from 2015, which genuinely transformed breakfast television – owed much to co-host Susanna Reid, expert at goading or controlling him as necessary. Talk TV may discover that he’s best in a double act. Although Murdoch’s Sunday Times listed a full Monday schedule for Talk TV from 6.30am, that in fact doesn’t start until Tuesday, with Julia Hartley-Brewer’s breakfast show. On launch night, before Morgan v Trump, viewers got The News Desk, which will run week nights at 7pm, fronted by Tom Newton Dunn, whose lips were initially out of sync with his words, an ominous echo of the technical problems that blighted the birth of GB News last year. Newton Dunn is a fluent broadcaster who would probably have had a BBC career if not demonised by being political editor of the Sun. From a studio desk, he links reports mainly from Murdoch newspaper reporters on Zoom. The tone throughout was at the populist end of the spectrum. The prime minister’s threat to unleash “the terrors of the earth” on whoever made misogynist allegations against Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner was discussed as if it were a startling Johnson coinage with no footnote that it’s a quote from King Lear. A closing “news panel” avoided mention of the threat to the PM over his law-breaking, which was perhaps wise as one of the commenters was James Slack, now Sun deputy editor, whose Downing Street leaving party is one of the events investigated by Sue Gray and the police. On this early evidence, Talk TV is much slicker than GB News but far less resourced and rigorous than Sky News (a Murdoch creation that he no longer owns.) Perhaps learning from GB News being hobbled by an advertiser boycott, there was nothing that would obviously concern corporations or Ofcom, although the return to TV (from 4-7pm on Tuesday) of Jeremy Kyle, a controversialist dropped from ITV over allegations of lack of duty of care to contestants, will be watched carefully. The launch night seemed short on commercials, some breaks between segments filled with promo clips. In an increasingly crowded news broadcast market, will there be enough finance to pay Morgan’s salary, or viewers to satisfy his ego? Sorry if that’s not wokey or whiny enough for him. But he’s going to have to do much worse than this to prevent liberals falling un-woke in front of his show.",Arts/Television & radio,Piers Morgan Uncensored review – a bad Jeremy Clarkson tribute act … with added Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/25/piers-morgan-uncensored-review-a-bad-jeremy-clarkson-tribute-act-with-added-trump
4/26/2022,"Elon Musk has reached a $44bn deal to buy Twitter in a takeover that will give the world’s richest man control of a social network with more than 200 million users. The sale will put the Tesla chief executive in charge of a company that he has frequently criticized, claiming it has not lived up to its potential as a platform for “free speech”. The deal on Monday comes after a dramatic few weeks of speculation about Twitter’s future, triggered by Musk’s emergence as the platform’s largest single shareholder on 4 April. He then declared a takeover bid on 14 April, offering to buy all Twitter’s shares for $54.20 each. At first, Twitter’s board seemed opposed, enacting an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could have made a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. But its initial reluctance to accept a transaction appeared to fade after Musk confirmed a funding package for the deal – including $21bn of his own money, alongside debt funding from Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions – and shareholders warmed to it. “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said in a statement posted to Twitter. “Twitter has tremendous potential – I look forward to working with the company and users to unlock it,” he added. 🚀💫♥️ Yesss!!! ♥️💫🚀 pic.twitter.com/0T9HzUHuh6 Twitter said the transaction had been unanimously approved by its board of directors and was expected to close in 2022, pending regulatory sign-off and the approval of shareholders. The platform has 217 active daily million users. “Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,” Twitter’s chief executive, Parag Agrawal, said in a tweet confirming the sale. “Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.” The Musk takeover has been unexpected and controversial amongst Twitter employees. Speaking at an all-hands meeting on Monday following news of the deal, Agrawal told employees that the future direction of the social network was uncertain. “Once the deal closes, we don’t know which direction the platform will go,” Agrawal said. Musk will join Twitter staff for a question-and-answer session at a later date, the company told employees. The company, which launched in 2006, currently has a market cap of nearly $40bn. Its co-founder Jack Dorsey stepped down as chief executive officer in November 2021, handing the reins to Agrawal, the company’s former chief technology officer. Musk is himself a prominent user of the app, with 83m followers, and tweeted as early as 2017 expressing interest in buying the company. He has signalled that Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company in order to build trust with users and do better at serving what he calls the “societal imperative” of free speech. “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he tweeted on Monday. It remains to be seen how Musk will reshape the company, but the billionaire has proposed several changes in recent weeks. They include relaxing its content restrictions, ridding the platform of fake and automated accounts, and shifting away from its advertising-based revenue model. Elaborating on his goals, Musk added on Monday that he wanted to “make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans”. Musk has long been a popular if contentious figure on the platform. And despite claiming to be a “free speech absolutist”, Musk regularly blocks social media users who have criticized him or his company and has used the platform to bully reporters who have written critical articles about him or his company. The deal is not expected to face serious scrutiny from US competition authorities because Musk’s other major business interests – Tesla, an electric car company, the SpaceX rocket business, and the tunnelling firm the Boring Company – do not compete with Twitter. It is, however, likely to draw comment from politicians and campaigning bodies given Twitter’s influence as an information source and Musk’s stance on free speech. The purchase also comes amid intensifying criticism of big tech’s power and underscores the ability of wealthy executives to control platforms used by millions. “No matter who owns or runs Twitter, the president has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms,” the White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki commented on the purchase on Monday. Senator Elizabeth Warren called the deal “dangerous for our democracy”. “Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain,” she tweeted. Rebecca Allensworth, professor of law at Vanderbilt University, described the deal as “troubling” due to the amount of power now wielded by Musk, a concern shared by many others. “There is something deeply troubling about a privately-held company holding the power Twitter does over public speech, especially if Twitter will be controlled by someone with as idiosyncratic views about speech as Musk. American free speech law is essentially just the first amendment, which only constrains government actors, not a company like Twitter or a person like Elon Musk,” she said. Speculation has already begun as to whether Musk will reinstate high profile accounts that have previously been removed for violating community guidelines, including that of Donald Trump. Trump was permanently banned from Twitter in 2021 for his use of the platform to incite unrest at the US capitol. After the deal was announced, the NAACP released a statement that urged Musk not to allow the 45th president back on to the platform. “Disinformation, misinformation and hate speech have NO PLACE on Twitter,” the civil rights organization said in a statement. “Do not allow 45 to return to the platform. Do not allow Twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech, or falsehoods that subvert our democracy.” Trump has so far said he would not return to Twitter if his account were reinstated, telling Fox News on Monday: “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth,” a reference to his own startup Truth Social. Suzanne Nossel, chief executive officer of PEN America, a non-profit organization that works to protect freedom of expression in the US, and a member of the Facebook Oversight Board, warned Musk against indulging in a “fantasy” of dismantling moderation guidelines. “Elon Musk will learn the same lesson about self-governing social media as he has about self-driving vehicles, which is that they unavoidably crash. Musk is right that our current systems of content moderation are biased and flawed, but the idea that the rules can be swept away wholesale is fallacy,” Nossel said. Musk is the world’s wealthiest person, according to Forbes, with a nearly $279bn fortune. He began building his wealth in 1999 when he sold Zip2, an online mapping and business directory, for $307m. He used his share to create what would become PayPal, sold to eBay for $1.5bn in 2002. That same year, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, after finding that cost constraints were limiting Nasas interplanetary travel. The company eventually developed cost-effective reusable rockets. In 2004, Musk was courted to invest in Tesla, then a startup trying to build an electric car. Eventually he became CEO and led the company to success as the world’s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles. Some have questioned how Musk will divide his time and attention between all the companies he operates, though his track record of successful ventures is also seen as a positive for Twitter. Shares of Twitter rose 5% on Monday to $51.50 per share after news of the sale.

4/26/2022,"‘OK Google … sensual mode.” The lighting dims in the bedsit of Andy Peacock as he whips up two espresso martinis and smoothly twirls with them to the bed, where his date is perched, coat still on, unimpressed. Andy looks up at a ceiling projection of the Milky Way, delivers a prepared speech about “the eterniddy of space” and leans in for a kiss. Within seconds the date has left, Andy is alone again and Peacock, a new BBC Three three-parter, is cementing Allan Mustafa’s reputation as British comedy’s top purveyor of preening, fragile losers.Mustafa was at the head of the ensemble in the fantastic People Just Do Nothing, playing MC Grindah, the self-absorbed leader of a gang of idiots attempting to run a pirate radio station in west London. That was a mockumentary, so the people instantly seeing through the bravado were us, the viewers. Peacock – written by Steve Stamp and Ben Murray, from the People Just Do Nothing team – is a traditional narrative comedy where Mustafa is Andy, a 36-year-old personal trainer from west London who has spent his entire working life so far in the same gym, convinced his job carries a powerful mystique that the women he meets cannot resist. The people seeing through his bravado are the women he meets.At first the heart sinks a little when we realise Mustafa is playing the same type of character he was in People Just Do Nothing, and indeed in The Curse earlier this year: the manchild whose pretensions are obvious to anyone with the common sense and confidence he lacks. Yes, Mustafa is extremely good at playing those blokes, but maybe he’d be pretty decent at something different. Early on in Peacock, when Andy mutters “Unbelievable!” in that familiar, quietly outraged mockumentary tone – after an incident where it was in fact he who was behaving unbelievably – it seems we might have a case of People Just Do One Thing.Peacock, however, is too canny in its characterisation, and too specific in its setting, to just be more of the same. Andy is the classic lothario singleton with deep insecurity behind the neatly maintained beard, still trying to jockey his mates into doing shots on his “Mandem Monday” nights out and aghast when the pals who have acquired wives and lives make their excuses and leave early. But Andy’s work as a “PT” opens up a particular seam of modern masculinity, that of the gym bro: guys who might once have had a sports car or chunky watch, now obsessing over protein shakes and what kind of squats build the shapeliest glutes. Andy’s tragedy is that he sees himself as that sort of geezer, but isn’t fully committed because underneath it all he’s a conservative, soft-willed goof. Good gags, subtle and not so, are thoughtfully sprinkled through the opening half-hour. The pompous “mmm” noise Mustafa makes, closing his eyes as Andy sips champagne before doling out a horribly cheesy line about his personal training philosophy (“The mind … is the most important muscle of all”), is a nice touch, as is the fact that his bedsit is on the top floor of his parents’ house. Andy has had a postbox installed on the landing wall and the number 36A stuck on the door: “It’s a completely separate property!” Mustafa’s comic instincts are unerring, giving Andy all the necessary desperation and just a smidgeon of threat – although whereas PJDN boldly showed us how bleak it was to be Grindah’s neglected girlfriend, here the agony is all Andy’s. The show is aware of the potentially queasy sexual politics of the gym, but in a scene where Andy is primed to take advantage of a client who’s turned on by his trainer’s uniform, he quickly ruins the vibe with his neuroses. The power is all hers. Similarly, Andy’s retrograde chat about “bros before hoes” and a “ball and chain” is shot down by other, more emotionally developed male characters. He’s well paired with Thomas Gray as Spooner, the faithful colleague who is about to recognise Andy as ridiculous, but is too polite not to go along with his laddishness. Spooner is expecting a baby with his wry, confidently relaxed partner, Blue (Sophia di Martino, who after her starring turn in Loki is a bit of a casting coup for a low-key BBC Three sitcom), and the dynamic between the trio – before they have their own child, Spooner and Blue will have to parent Andy through his looming identity crisis – is tenderly judged. Yes, in the era of comedy post-Brent and Partridge, blithe berks who eventually win our sympathy have been everywhere, but sitcom men have had a lot of stuff to work through. Peacock puts them one step closer to moving on.",Arts/Television & radio,Peacock review – ready for the new David Brent or Alan Partridge?

4/26/2022,"If avoiding relegation is about rolling your sleeves up and fighting for everything then, on this evidence, Leeds should just about make it. A second successive clean sheet on the road earned Jesse Marsch’s side a point that could prove priceless. It definitely wasn’t pretty on a night when tempers frayed on both sides, although with Crystal Palace having now moved even closer to rubber-stamping their Premier League status for another season there was no reason for Patrick Vieira to complain other than perhaps the below-par performance of the referee. Sixteen days had passed since Leeds defeated Watford in their last match, but Burnley’s resurgence since sacking Sean Dyche meant that this was an opportunity to avoid being dragged into the relegation battle. Marsch was able to name Kalvin Phillips in his starting line-up for the first time, with the England midfielder making a long-awaited return from a hamstring injury he sustained in December. The absence of Phillips for so long has not helped Leeds’s predicament, although Marsch’s return of 11 points from seven games – and now five matches unbeaten – since taking over from Marcelo Bielsa at the end of February has eased some of the pressure. Leeds have established a five-point cushion over Everton going into the final stretch of the season, albeit having played a game more. “The result is big – every point is important and gets us closer towards our ultimate goal,” acknowledged Marsch, the former RB Leipzig manager, who described their next opponents Manchester City as the best team in the world having faced them earlier this season in the Champions League group stages. “Having Kalvin back can really help us.” The American shared a warm embrace with Vieira before kick off having previously locked horns with the Palace manager while in charge of New York Red Bulls and New York City FC respectively in MLS, although he probably didn’t mention that the last two meetings had ended in 4-0 victories for Marsch. Palace seemed determined to make amends for a disappointing run of three defeats that included the FA Cup semi-final loss to Chelsea having put seven goals without reply past Arsenal and Everton in their last two matches here. Jean-Philippe Mateta had an early sighter after racing onto a long pass but his lob over Illan Meslier lacked power, while a stretching Diego Llorente just did enough to deny the Frenchman following a teasing cross from Jordan Ayew. While the travelling supporters made their frustrations known over the decision to schedule this match on an evening when there were no trains from London back to Yorkshire, they had little to excite them on the pitch until Liam Cooper’s header from a Jack Harrison corner that went straight into Vicente Guaita’s arms in the 27th minute. Pitted against a potential rival for a place in England’s World Cup squad in the incessant Conor Gallagher, Phillips was one of three Leeds players to avoid being cautioned by the referee, Darren England, for fouls on Wilfried Zaha in the first half – decisions that didn’t go down well with the Ivory Coast forward and the home supporters. Luke Ayling was particularly lucky to escape after two fouls on him and some of Zaha’s frustration seemed to boil over when he appeared to raise his hands towards Raphinha, although the Brazilian certainly made the most of the opportunity to throw himself to the ground and there was no punishment. Joachim Andersen finally became the first player to be shown a yellow card just before half-time as England left the pitch to a chorus of boos from the Palace fans. “Wilf showed a lot of maturity to keep his cool,” admitted Vieira, who felt his side deserved to take all three points. “The only thing that was missing was a goal.” His team have not conceded a first half goal at home since losing to Liverpool on 23 January but Palace were almost caught napping at the restart as Leeds went on the attack. The hosts certainly looked more likely to snatch the victory once France Under-21 forward Michael Olise was introduced from the bench late on, with Gallagher’s appeals for a penalty against Llorente correctly turned down by VAR. The Spaniard was booked for dragging back Zaha before the Palace forward forced Meslier into a double save with his legs at the near post, while the Frenchman again stood firm when Gallagher was set up by a brilliant piece of skill by Olise to make sure Leeds left south London feeling pretty pleased with themselves.",Sport/Football,Leeds scrap their way to precious point despite Crystal Palace’s late push,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/25/crystal-palace-leeds-premier-league-match-report
4/26/2022,"Owen Farrell has been heralded as one of the all-time greats by his Saracens and England teammate Jamie George, who says he cannot understand the criticism that comes the fly-half’s way. Farrell was the standout performer in Saracens’ comprehensive victory against Exeter on Sunday and seems revitalised after a prolonged spell on the sidelines as a result of two ankle operations. Indeed, Farrell was making only his fourth appearance for Saracens since October but is showing the form that escaped him for large periods of the previous campaign as well as the British & Irish Lions tour of South Africa last summer. His dip was such that his place as the England captain has been questioned and Eddie Jones has offered Farrell no guarantees of a return to the squad for the summer tour of Australia. George, however, is in no doubt about the 30-year-old’s ability and importance to Saracens, who qualified for the playoffs in their first season back in the top flight thanks to the bonus-point win against Exeter. “He is one of the best players that has ever played the game,” George said. “Some of the criticism he gets, I can never get my head around. Come down to Saracens every week and watch him play, he is the very reason why we have won as much as we have. Can you imagine playing with him? “People hear it on the ref mic or whatever but imagine being next to that when it is happening. It is incredible. Do you know how hard it is to talk whilst you are that tired? I talk a lot but there is a cessation in the game when I think: ‘I can’t do it.’ He does it for 80 minutes, non-stop, relentlessly. It is all of the stuff people don’t see.” Given England managed only two wins during the Six Nations, Farrell’s absence was keenly felt and if he continues in his current vein of form it seems inconceivable he will not tour Australia. George revealed that while England suffered in his absence, Farrell was still playing an important role at Saracens. “He turned into our head coach, he is that good,” George said. “He is so, so important to this team and he offers so much on and off the field. With his voice, with his actions, in the week the way he prepares, he shows people how it is done. I can’t speak highly enough of him. He is the best player I have worked with in every facet of the game.”",Sport/Sport,"Owen Farrell ‘one of best ever’, claims Saracens teammate Jamie George",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/25/jamie-george-heaps-praise-on-incredible-saracens-captain-owen-farrell
4/26/2022,"A convoy of trucks that had gathered outside a California lawmaker’s house over the weekend to protest her support of an abortion rights bill was forced to leave the area after crossing paths with a group of young people armed with eggs. The people’s convoy, inspired by Canadian truckers who shut down roads to protest vaccine mandates, arrived in the Bay Area last week after weeks of demonstrations in Washington DC. On Friday, about 20 drivers filled the road near the home of Buffy Wicks, a Democratic assemblymember, honking, and using bullhorns to demand she leave her home. The group was reportedly protesting legislation Wicks wrote that would end coroner investigations of stillbirths, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, and require state businesses to mandate Covid vaccines for their employees. The convoy, however, drew fierce opposition from neighbors, who told the drivers to leave the residential street, SF Gate reported. Wicks called law enforcement for protection, and the trucks dispersed when police responded to the scene. When the convoy got stuck in traffic outside an Oakland Safeway, however, a group of residents began throwing eggs at the stalled vehicles, shouting “get the fuck out of here”, according to video of the incident. Passersby partook as well, grabbing eggs and tossing them at trucks scrawled with phrases such as “Let’s go Brandon”, a coded term among Trump supporters to insult Joe Biden, as they drove by. Many of those throwing eggs at the group were kids who cheered each other on and then fled after running out of eggs.

4/26/2022,"Carlo Ancelotti believes Real Madrid’s record of 13 European Cup wins is a “positive burden” for his players as they face Manchester City in the Champions League semi-final first leg on Tuesday night. Real last won the competition in 2018, sealing a third consecutive triumph, while Ancelotti was the head coach who guided the club to their 10th success in 2014. Although the Italian said he and his team are happy to have reached the last four, the 62-year-old manager stated success in the competition for Real is to be in the final. “I think the history that Real Madrid has in this competition counts for a lot, more for us than opponents,” Ancelotti said. “This history that has grown helps our players to feel the weight of the shirt, but it’s a positive burden and responsibility to have that. “For Real Madrid, it’s not a success to get to the semi-final, we feel it’s a success to get to the final. Normally, if Real Madrid get to the final, there is more of a possibility to win it.” Real, who have knocked out Paris Saint-Germain and the holders, Chelsea, in the past two rounds, have not played since an away win at Osasuna last Wednesday. City also played then and have done so again since – the 5-1 victory against Watford on Saturday. Ancelotti is unsure if this will aid his side, however. “It is difficult to say but I think the players in this period [of the season] are used to playing every three days,” Ancelotti said. “There’s more risk of injuries [playing every three days] but to recover from one game to another, the players are used to doing that and it will be no problem. So I don’t think we can take advantage of this.” Ancelotti is sure that City will provide a tough test at the Etihad Stadium, before the return leg at the Bernabéu next week. “We need to play well. I think the fact the away goal rule has changed, means it will be a more open tie,” he said. “We have to play for 180 minutes and in this type of game there’s a mix of happiness and joy, because you’ve managed to get so close to the final in the most important competition in the world – and that worry of playing against such a strong team. “We have had really tough games, against all the teams who were favourites in this competition and it’s gone well for us. We will fight again tomorrow.”",Sport/Football,"Real Madrid’s Champions League record is ‘positive burden’, says Carlo Ancelotti",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/25/real-madrid-champions-league-manchester-city-semi-final-carlo-ancelotti
4/26/2022,"For families of the 97 people unlawfully killed at Hillsborough it is yet another traumatic blow that the Bar Standards Board (BSB) has cleared Jonathan Goldberg QC of misconduct over his inflammatory little speeches about the disaster that he made last year. During the decades since they lost their loved ones owing to the gross negligence of South Yorkshire police families have been forced to fight relentless police lies and cover-ups about the cause of the disaster, and many legal letdowns. But contemplating Goldberg’s repetition of the original 1989 police case, that the victims, Liverpool supporters themselves, were to blame for the disaster, and the BSB’s self-important, tin-eared exoneration, it is striking how forcefully the families did succeed in establishing the truth. It is increasingly important now, given the disturbing impulse of some football fans to disrespect the 97, the incalculable human suffering, and subject Liverpool supporters to hateful chanting. Goldberg made his comments when his client Peter Metcalf, South Yorkshire police’s solicitor in 1989, was acquitted by a judge’s direction of perverting the course of public justice for advising that police officers’ accounts of the disaster be amended. Outside the court, then in a BBC radio interview, Goldberg portrayed the acquittal of Metcalf and two former police officers as a finding that there was no cover-up, and said Liverpool supporters’ behaviour on the day had been “perfectly appalling”. But Metcalf’s acquittal was based on a somewhat narrow ruling by the judge, Mr Justice William Davis, much criticised by families. Davis dismissed the prosecution mainly on the basis that Lord Justice Taylor’s official inquiry, to which the amended statements were sent, was not a course of public justice. But Davis stated that, had the Taylor inquiry been a course of public justice, Metcalf would have had “a case to answer”, in relation to four officers’ statements. These involved removing evidence that, at previous Hillsborough matches, police officers closed a tunnel leading to the Leppings Lane terrace when the central “pens” were full. At the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, Ch Supt David Duckenfield, in charge of his first match at Hillsborough, did not close off that tunnel. He had failed to manage access for 24,000 Liverpool supporters through the bottleneck, hazardous approach to just 23 Leppings Lane turnstiles, and a compacted crush built up there. At 2:52pm Duckenfield ordered a wide exit gate to be opened and allowed 2,000 people through together. Most headed down the open tunnel, and the 97 men, women and children were killed in the resulting crush. Hundreds more people suffered injuries, including brain damage from loss of oxygen. On the 33rd anniversary this year David Hughes, 17 when his father Eric, 42, died at Hillsborough, made public the damage to his mental health caused by these subsequent years of police lies, the families’ having to fight them, and the endless legal proceedings which constantly revisit and replay the horrific details. So even having to restate the truth, because somebody resurrected the lies or some football fans disgraced themselves, puts families through it yet again. Duckenfield himself, notoriously, started the lies even while the disaster was continuing, falsely saying supporters had forced the gate that he had opened. That detail was soon withdrawn but South Yorkshire police embraced the substance of that myth, denying their own failures and seeking to blame the victims. In the decades of proceedings the police case was disbelieved in the most senior arenas. Taylor rejected it in his official inquiry report of August 1989 and severely criticised the police for advancing it. Nevertheless the force tried it again at the first inquest, in 1990-91, of Dr Stefan Popper, the local Sheffield coroner. Popper decided on the day at Hillsborough, after conversations with police officers, that supporters drinking might be a factor, and he ordered blood samples to be taken and tested for alcohol – from all the victims, even the young children. That is a violation that still causes profound outrage. Popper’s inquest, and its verdict of accidental death, was a miscarriage of justice that devoured families’ lives for 21 years before they finally saw it quashed in 2012. Doing so, the Lord Chief Justice, Igor Judge, said of the police case: “Notwithstanding its falsity the tendency to blame the fans was disappointingly tenacious and it lingered on for many years.” At the new, 2014-16 inquests, under the Human Rights Act, the families had “exceptional funding” for their own lawyers for the first time and they demolished the police case. The jury determined that the 97 were unlawfully killed owing to gross negligence manslaughter by Duckenfield. The police advanced their allegations again, and officers were questioned on their statements in exhaustive detail. Video of the scenes outside was played repeatedly, showing how early people arrived, how they conducted themselves, and that congestion built up at the too-few turnstiles from 2:15pm. Asked the question directly, the jury found that the police case was not borne out by the evidence and determined that no behaviour of Liverpool supporters contributed to the disaster. It was another ordeal for the families when the same discredited allegations were nevertheless raised again at Duckenfield’s 2019 prosecution for gross negligence manslaughter, where he was acquitted. The torture of the legal system, apparently approved by the BSB, is that hard-won truths are not preserved; everything is up for grabs again in the next adversarial process. But the inquest verdict is more concrete: unlawful killing is the stated cause of death on official certificates of 97 people. Nobody has challenged it. So when Goldberg strode out of court after Metcalf’s acquittal, he might have been expected not to trample on that; to restrict his comments, if he had to make any, to Davis’s ruling. Instead he said the Liverpool fans had caused “a riot” at Hillsborough, and he repeated the falsity that the people who came through the gate crushed those who had arrived in the pens early. The terrace’s dangerous condition was such that 30 of those who died had themselves come through the exit gate. Goldberg said afterwards that he was not disrespecting the inquest, nor repeating or endorsing the police narrative as true. But the BSB cleared Goldberg on the basis that he was entitled to do that anyway, as a matter of free speech. They decided to opine on the disaster themselves, saying the BSB panel had reviewed the past proceedings and police statements and decided that “a reasonable person” acting “in good faith” could still form the view that Goldberg expressed. The BSB’s position appears to occupy a huge irony. Step out of their self-regulating bubble into a modern football stadium, where fans can now drink far more around matches than they ever did in the basic facilities of the 1980s. Some fans for whom football is a vehicle for poisonous tribalism perpetuate in toxic chants the original police lies and their dissemination by the Sun. By lending legitimacy to old, discredited accusations of misbehaviour, the BSB appears to have aligned itself with those who misbehave now. Ten more years have passed since the Lord Chief Justice said the false police case was “disappointingly tenacious”.

4/26/2022,"Shortly before the Tokyo Olympics a top British gymnastics coach was removed from the Great Britain Olympic coaching team on account of allegations about her treatment of a former gymnast, according to a report published by BBC Sport. The veteran coach Liz Kincaid coached a number of gymnasts including Amelie Morgan, part of the historic Olympic bronze medal‑winning team in Tokyo, but an allegation was made against her relating to the mental health of one her former gymnasts, which prompted an investigation. Under the British Olympic Association rules the investigation left her ineligible for the British team in Tokyo. In July 2021 it was announced that Kincaid would retire from the sport. Two gymnasts have since stepped forward with further allegations against Kincaid, which range from claims that she implored them to compete while seriously injured to her shaming gymnasts about their weight. Poppy Wynn, a 25‑year‑old former gymnast, said she tore her perineum at 12 years old after falling off the uneven bars during an unmonitored set and landing in oversplits. Kincaid allegedly told Wynn’s mother that she had merely started her period but doctors immediately identified a far more serious injury. “I went to Liz, I had blood dripping down my leg and she then took me into the office and gave me sanitary pads to effectively mop up the blood and then sent me back into the gym,” Wynn told the BBC. Wynn claimed that, under Kincaid, she trained on a broken hand for six weeks, while the former British champion Sophie Jameson said she was made to train on a broken ankle and she was once required to continue “excruciating” upper body training while recovering from a dislocated knee. Both gymnasts said Kincaid spoke to them demeaningly, shouting in the faces of gymnasts and weight-shaming them. Kincaid has denied all of the allegations made against her, issuing a statement to the BBC. It read: “The health, well-being and safety of the gymnasts under my care and tuition was of paramount importance to me and a matter close to my heart. To suggest I would mistreat the gymnasts goes against every principle I live by and is very upsetting.” The allegations are the latest in a long list of similar claims as gymnastics reckons with allegations of abusive coaching methods widespread around the world. In 2020 numerous British gymnasts, including Becky and Ellie Downie, Nile Wilson and Amy Tinkler, came forward with accusations of mistreatment and abuse against a number of the sport’s coaches and officials. British gymnastics is under an independent investigation led by Anne Whyte QC and initiated by UK Sport and Sport England.

4/26/2022,"Conservative whips have said they are trying to find out the identity of the Tory MP responsible for misogynistic attacks on Angela Rayner, with a view to taking disciplinary action after Boris Johnson threatened to unleash “the terrors of the earth” against the culprit. The prime minister hit out at the “sexist, misogynistic tripe” in the Mail on Sunday, which ran allegations from an anonymous MP that Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, deliberately tried to distract Johnson by crossing and uncrossing her legs in the House of Commons. Following outrage across Westminster, the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, told MPs on Monday that he had asked for a meeting with the Mail on Sunday editor, David Dillon, as well as the chair of the press gallery in the Commons. It comes after Caroline Nokes, the Conservative chair of the women and equalities committee, wrote to Hoyle asking him to look into revoking the parliamentary pass of the article’s author, Glen Owen. Amid pressure to unmask the MP behind the claims, a source close to the whips said: “Questions are being asked around the palace and if the anonymous source is identified, action will be taken.” However, their action appears to stop short of a formal investigation. The Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) received more than 5,000 complaints about the story, which Rayner described as “gutter journalism” while accusing the sources of “spreading desperate, perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save [the prime minister’s] skin”. The newspaper had reported that a Tory MP claimed Rayner was adopting a “Basic Instinct” style ploy towards Johnson, in a reference to the Sharon Stone 1992 film in which she flashes a policeman during an interview. Following the outcry, a number of female MPs spoke of their own experiences of sexism in Westminster. Nokes told the Guardian’s First Edition newsletter that she had once been the subject of an article along with former Tory MP Claire Perry “that actually compared our boobs”. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater recounted how she had been in a meeting with a male MP who “definitely spoke more comfortably … to my male staff member than he did to me”. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told BBC Radio 4 that a Tory MP had questioned how, with a newborn baby, she would have been able to be a cabinet minister if Labour had won the election. She said the slur against Rayner was “the sort of thing that happens day in, day out in parliament”. The incident “shines a spotlight” on other female MPs’ experiences of sexism and misogyny, she said. “I am sick and tired of the way that female MPs and women are treated in parliament, and if this story, this outrageous slur on Angela, gets change, that would be a good thing,” she said. Johnson suggested his party would investigate to find out who was responsible for the claims. Asked whether there was a cultural problem in parliament, Johnson said: “It’s hard to say on the basis of that particular story. But I have to say I thought it was the most appalling load of sexist, misogynist tripe. I immediately got in touch with Angela and we had a very friendly exchange.” In a reference to King Lear, he threatened to unleash “the terrors of the earth” on the source behind the comments if they were identified. “If we ever find who is responsible for it, I don’t know what we will do, but they will be the terrors of the earth,” he said. “It’s totally intolerable, that kind of thing.” The Speaker has not commented on the calls for Owen to lose his Commons pass but is expected to give Dillon a dressing down when he meets the newspaper’s editor. There is also a precedent for a non-MP being hauled before the House of Commons itself to apologise for an article – in 1957. On that occasion, the editor of the Sunday Express, John Junor, was brought by the serjeant at arms to the bar and admonished by the Speaker for publishing an article that cast doubt on the integrity of MPs over their constituency petrol allowances. In the Commons on Monday, Hoyle said: “I share the views expressed by a wide range of members … that yesterday’s article was reporting unsubstantial claims [that were] misogynistic and offensive. Those are what we believe. In being demeaning, offensive to women in parliament, it can only deter women who might considering standing for election, to the detriment of us all.” Earlier on Monday, Chris Philp, a junior minister, said he expected government whips would investigate and that if the source’s identity emerged then he would “imagine they would be subject to discipline”.Asked why Johnson and the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, had posted identical tweets denouncing the claims, Philp said this was “nothing surprising” because they had “reached the same view and they have used the same words”.",News/Politics,Tory whips ‘asking questions’ to find MP behind Angela Rayner claims,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/angela-rayner-sexism-misogyny-tory-whips
4/26/2022,"MPs and peers are set for some late nights over the next few days as government and opposition race to complete six bills in time for parliament to be prorogued by the end of this week. Though the House of Commons leader, Mark Spencer, said business would conclude by Thursday – which would give MPs next week to get some shoe leather on the pavements ahead of the local elections – the Lords may have other ideas. It means whips may decide to have the Commons sit next Tuesday and Wednesday, potentially throwing some MPs’ election schedules into disarray. The unpalatability of that prospect may force the government to compromise on amendments to legislation made by the House of Lords – who have signalled they are prepared to continue to send bills back to the Commons even at the 11th hour. The parliamentary battles in the week ahead read like a rogues gallery of all the most difficult and controversial proposals that Boris Johnson has announced – from noisy protests, to offshoring asylum seekers, to costs for renters in unsafe buildings and changes to election law. On Monday, peers amended the elections bill to strengthen the independence of the electoral commission, having previously also voted to prevent the use of voter ID. The elections bill and the nationality and borders bill are among those where compromise appears the most likely in the coming days – which could have some significant ramifications. Peers made 12 amendments to the bill, which returns to the Lords on Tuesday without compromise. At least six are expected to be returned to the Commons again on totemic issues such as the right of asylum seekers to work after six months, proposed by the Tory peer Philippa Stroud. The Lords also voted to amend the controversial offshoring proposals in the bill, which would allow asylum seekers to be sent overseas to a third country for their claims to be processed. The government announced its policy of sending claimants to Rwanda for asylum since the last debate. Another policy that peers are expected to double down on is an amendment from Labour peer Vernon Coaker to water down a provision in the bill on arriving in the UK without permission. It would clarify that the new offence applies only to those doing so in breach of a deportation order. There are other bills where Lords sources believe the government could make concessions in order to get them through in time. On the judicial review and courts bill, peers are hopefully of a win – or at the very least a commitment to review – on an amendment on legal aid for the bereaved. Peers are also likely to return their amendment to the policing bill, to change the proposed new law that would outlaw noisy protests. On all these issues, it is possible the government will not give any further ground. Or the compromises offered could be acceptable but weak – a promise of a review of the policy in a certain time period, for example. Crossbenchers, on which many of the votes will ultimately depend, often lose appetite for inflicting defeats on the elected house. But most peers who seek to change the legislation seem resolute – especially on the borders bill. It will be interesting to see if the bill about which Johnson and Priti Patel have been their noisiest will end up having some kind of quiet compromise on its most eye-watering proposals.",News/UK news,Election schedules could favour compromise on government’s most controversial bills,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/election-schedules-could-favour-compromise-on-governments-most-controversial-bills
4/26/2022,"Elon Musk, the holder of one of Twitter’s most followed accounts, is now its owner. On the evidence of his tweets over the past month, expect change at the social media platform. Here are some of the biggest issues you can expect him to address. Musk has described himself as a “free speech absolutist”, and the fate of the former US president’s suspended Twitter account represents a strong test of that ideal. Trump was banned permanently shortly after the Capitol riot in January 2021, as the company cited his repeated violations of the company’s rules and the risk of “further incitement of violence”. Musk said this month that he was “very cautious with permanent bans” on Twitter and would prefer a timeout system. But he has not directly addressed the issue of Trump’s account, which had almost 89 million followers. Speaking at a TED conference, Musk said: “I think it’s very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech. Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have the … reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law.” However, Trump was banned in part because Twitter feared his tweets were inciting law-breaking. Musk has to reconcile his free speech principles with legal reality – and Trump’s history on the platform. On Monday evening the former president told Fox News he did not even wish to return and would use his own startup, Truth Social, instead. Nonetheless, one group of House Republicans has urged Musk to act. Hey, @elonmusk it's a great week to free @realDonaldTrump. The social media industry is coming under more stringent regulation, particularly in Europe. Last week the EU announced the Digital Services Act, under which companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Google will have to do more to tackle illegal content or face multibillion-euro fines. It will be preceded by the UK’s online safety bill, which requires social media platforms to protect their users from harmful content and comes into force at about the end of the year. In the US there are moves for regulatory change, although they must overcome perennial political gridlock. Legislative proposals in Washington include creating a new digital safety bureau at the Federal Trade Commission and the creation of new children’s safety requirements for tech companies. The latter is co-sponsored by the Democrat senator Richard Blumenthal, who led an explosive evidence session with the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen last year and has been vocal in his support for the greater regulation of social media. Twitter investors have long been concerned with the company’s growth in revenue and users. In its most recent quarterly results, revenue grew more slowly than expected, despite rising 22% to $1.6bn in the last three months of 2021. However, daily active users rose by 25 million over the year to 217 million as the company reiterated its goal of hitting 315 million such users by the end of next year. In a since-deleted tweet this month, Musk raised the possibility of removing advertising from the platform’s premium service, Blue, which is available in the US and Australia but not the UK. Twitter makes 90% of its annual revenue of $5bn (£3.8bn) from advertising, so Musk was broaching a potentially radical move. Musk is not the first Twitter shareholder to express concerns about how the company is run. Elliott Management, an activist investment firm, took a stake in Twitter in 2020, amid reports that it thought the platform had a distracted chief executive in Jack Dorsey and was not adding innovative new products quickly enough. Dorsey survived the initial pressure but left in November last year and his replacement, Parag Agrawal, was promoted to the top post from the position of chief technology officer. In a message to the Twitter chairman, Bret Taylor, Musk made clear that another executive shake-up is in the offing if he succeeds in buying the company. “If the deal doesn’t work, given that I don’t have confidence in management nor do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.” Musk is CEO of Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX, as well as being the owner of the tunnelling business the Boring Company, so there are enough demands on his time already. Tesla shareholders will want Musk to stay focused on running a $1tn electric carmaker but it would be a surprise if Musk is a hands-off owner of Twitter. There will be changes at Twitter under Musk’s ownership and an edit button is one of the options under consideration. In a flurry of tweets posted in the wake of his emergence as a 9.2% shareholder in Twitter earlier this month, Musk flagged the possibility of introducing the feature. The ability to undo a tweet posted in haste is available to Blue subscribers only, who have a 60-second grace period after posting their tweet in which they can remove it before it is seen by anyone. Do you want an edit button? Twitter subsequently confirmed that it had been looking at the edit button idea. Other changes suggested by Musk include making Twitter’s algorithm open source, meaning users would be able to view the algorithm that curates what users see. Musk has also said that Twitter users should be able to see if their post has been promoted or demoted.",News/Technology,Five things in Elon Musk’s in-tray after Twitter takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/25/five-things-in-elon-musks-in-tray-after-twitter-takeover
4/26/2022,"It’s normal practice for a prime minister to report back to the House at the first available opportunity on returning from an overseas trip. So you’d have thought Boris Johnson would have been keen to make a statement to the Commons about last week’s Indian adventure. Both to tell stories of how he bravely forgot to mention India’s neutrality towards Russia in its war on Ukraine during his meeting with the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and of a country in which he isn’t universally disliked and mistrusted. But The Convict thought better of it. He used to regard the Commons as his natural habitat. An environment in which he was guaranteed to get the love and laughter that he craves. Now it’s a symbol of his disgrace. An unwelcome reminder of his dishonesty. A sore that can never begin to heal until either he does the decent thing and resigns or his fragile ego crumbles under the weight of his lies. The only MPs to even pretend to believe a word he says these days are the spineless ministerial apparatchiks, now engaged in a constant internal struggle between abject denial and cognitive dissonance – think the junior culture minister Chris Philp, who has yet to find an arse he didn’t want to brown-nose and who had sworn blind on national television on Monday morning that it was entirely plausible that Johnson and Nadine Dorries could have independently sent identical tweets: how little self-worth must you have to do that? – and fawning halfwitted sycophants, such as Micky Fabricant. The rest either confront The Convict head on, either openly laughing or spitting with rage at his deceit, or maintain a silence laced with contempt. So instead of staying in Westminster, thanking his lucky stars that he hadn’t yet received a second fixed-penalty notice for the party in which the empties and the stragglers had been picked out of the flowerbeds, Johnson had headed north to Bury. Quite what he was doing there was anyone’s guess. According to Number 10, he was campaigning for the local elections. But as most councillors now concede that he is a liability, the only thing he can have been campaigning for is to increase the number of Tory losses next week. After kicking a football aimlessly at Bury FC, Johnson did a pool clip for the lunchtime news. Inevitably, most questions focused on his reaction to the previous day’s Mail on Sunday article in which a Tory MP had claimed Angela Rayner tried to distract Johnson at prime minister’s questions by crossing and uncrossing her legs. The Convict said he was furious. Not only had a woman never managed to put him off his stride in the past – he had maintained his laser-like focus even when Jennifer Arcuri had been pole-dancing in front of him – but such misogyny had no place in his Tory party. “If we ever find who is responsible for it,” he said, “I don’t know what we will do, but they will be the terrors of the Earth.” This sounded very much like a quote from King Lear. A subject on which Johnson may yet become an expert if he ever gets round to employing a researcher to write most of the Shakespeare biography for which he has trousered a reported £800k advance. Though he might now be wishing he had chosen his Lear more carefully. The extract he referenced is from when Lear is in the process of going mad and losing his kingdom. Who knows, within a few days he might take to walking naked on the heath. Then the emperor really will have no clothes. It also wasn’t entirely clear just how seriously Johnson was taking the Rayner claims. He did at least manage not to smirk as he condemned those who had briefed the story but The Convict himself has form for sexism and misogyny. Just think of his descriptions of women beach volleyball players at the 2012 Olympics as “glistening like wet otters” and women in burkas as “letterboxes”. Or that women who voted Tory would have bigger breasts. Even when he’s seemingly not to blame, he’s still a liability. His weight of baggage is just too heavy. One person who was taking this seriously was the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, who began proceedings in the Commons by saying he had arranged a meeting with the editor of the Mail on Sunday to discuss the matter. We then moved on to Home Office departmental questions. A rather bloodless affair, which had the feel of everyone going through the motions in the run-up to another week’s recess before the state opening of parliament. Still, even an only semi-engaged Priti Patel is plenty vicious and stupid enough to provide some entertainment. She sat proudly beside Tom Pursglove, a junior Home Office minister who might possibly be dimmer than she is – even between them both they can’t supply a connecting synapse – only to stand up to once more declare Rwanda to be an African paradise. If there was a problem with her asylum seeker policy it was that the Channel would be overcrowded with refugees coming over in search of a free air ticket. And anyone who questioned Rwanda’s human rights record was just racist. It was when she got to the costs that she became seriously deranged. It wasn’t up to her to tell the Commons how much the scheme would cost, she insisted. It was up to the opposition parties to come up with different proposals. Though if she had listened, she would have realised they had. But by now, Priti Vacant was off on one. Labour shouldn’t care about what the scheme costs as they had said it was unworkable. So it wouldn’t cost the taxpayer anything anyway. She paused to give her own benches a knowing look. She genuinely thought it was a “Gotcha” moment.

4/26/2022,"The US defense secretary’s declaration that Washington wanted to see Russia weakened militarily and unable to recover quickly, marks a shift in Washington’s declared aims underlying its military support for Ukraine. At a press conference in Poland after a surprise visit to Kyiv, Lloyd Austin was asked if he would now define US goals differently from those set out soon after the Russian invasion. In response, he started out with the established administration line about helping Ukraine retain its sovereignty and defend its territory. Then Austin added a second goal: “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.” That meant Russia should “not have the capability to very quickly reproduce” the forces and equipment that had been lost in Ukraine. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, estimated those losses on Monday as a quarter of Russia’s pre-invasion strength, with more than 2,000 armoured vehicles knocked out, including at least 530 tanks, as well as 60 aircraft. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who travelled with Austin to see Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv, agreed with his formulation of US objectives, saying: “I think the secretary said it very well”. The two officials were talking as the first howitzers from the latest tranche of US military supplies began arriving in Ukraine, and $165m in supplies of “non-standard” ex-Soviet compatible ammunition was announced. The remarks suggested that even if Russian forces withdrew or were expelled from the Ukrainian territory they have occupied since 24 February, the US and its allies would seek to maintain sanctions with the aim of stopping Russia reconstituting its forces. It also indicated Washington is taking a position in an internal debate within Nato on whether to use the opportunity of Vladimir Putin’s strategic blunder in Ukraine to try to hobble his ability to threaten other countries in the future. “The balance in Nato itself has shifted,” Rajan Menon, the director of the grand strategy programme at the Defense Priorities thinktank, said. “The argument now seems to be this is not just about Ukraine; it’s about a larger problem, that is the threat that Russia poses to Europe as a whole. And if you look at it that way, then these comments begin to make sense.” “The Russians are on the retreat, so you have this flush of optimism which has moved the goalposts,” Menon, professor emeritus in international relations at Columbia University, said. “Once Washington says it, those in Nato who want the war to be about that are empowered, because what the US says matters.” If those are the Biden administration’s aims, there is a separate question of whether it was sensible to declare them so bluntly. It arguably weakens Russia’s incentive to withdraw, reinforces Moscow’s narrative that Nato is waging a proxy war in Ukraine aimed at weakening Russia and even regime change, deepening Putin’s paranoia. “If I was writing the secretary’s talking points, I would prefer he said: our goal is that Ukraine wins, rather than our goal is to weaken Russia because they are two sides of the same coin, but one would have been much more aligned with what the administration has been saying,” said Alina Polyakova, the president of the Center for European Policy Analysis, said. “Certainly this will be used by the Russian state media to double down on the narrative that we’ve already seen from the Russian government, that the US is ‘out to get us’, that they want to destroy Russia,” she said, but added: “Frankly, I don’t think we should worry too much about how this will be spun by the Russian media, because they can spin anything.” Ultimately, Polyakova said, Austin was voicing a widespread feeling about the long-term threat posed by Putin that is increasingly difficult to ignore. “I think the secretary’s comments were truthful in that it will be in the greater interest of global stability and European security not to have a military aggressive state, bordering Nato or bordering Europe,” she said. “I think that’s very obvious.”",News/World news,Pentagon chief’s Russia remarks show shift in US’s declared aims in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/russia-weakedend-lloyd-austin-ukraine
4/26/2022,"The Texas court of criminal appeals has issued a stay of execution for Melissa Lucio, the Mexican-American woman who was set to be judicially killed within 48 hours, ordering a lower court to consider new evidence of her innocence in the death of her two-year-old daughter Mariah. The court issued its order on Monday as the final clock was ticking on Lucio’s transfer to the death chamber. She would have been the first Hispanic woman executed by Texas. As Wednesday’s scheduled execution date grew closer, calls for a stay to give time for new scientific evidence of her innocence to be reviewed grew to fever pitch. The intensity of the outcry against her pending death rivaled that of the case of Troy Davis, the African American man executed by Georgia in 2011 despite serious doubts around his guilt. New evidence presented by Lucio’s legal team in a 266-page petition suggested that the murder of her toddler daughter had never even happened. Medical and eye-witness evidence pointed towards Mariah having died after accidentally falling down a steep flight of stairs at Lucio’s rental home. In a statement, Lucio thanked the court of criminal appeals for giving her the chance “to live and prove my innocence. Mariah is in my heart today and always.” Sandra Babcock, one of Lucio’s legal team and a professor at Cornell law school, said that the court’s decision paved the way for a new trial which would allow a jury to hear evidence that was not presented at her original trial in 2008. Five of the 12 jury members from that trial have said that had they known what is now known about the case they would have decided differently. Babcock said: “Melissa’s life matters. As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and intimate partner violence, and now locked away for these past 15 years, Melissa’s voice and experiences have never been valued. The Court’s decision signals its willingness to finally hear Melissa’s side of the story.” Vanessa Potkin of the Innocence Project, who also represents Lucio, said: “Medical evidence shows that Mariah’s death was consistent with an accident. But for the State’s use of false testimony, no juror would have voted to convict Melissa of capital murder because no murder occurred.” Jeff Leach, the Republican lawmaker who led the push in the Texas House for a delay of execution, greeted the news of the stay with delight, saying it would secure “justice for Melissa and for Mariah and the entire Lucio family”. Earlier, Leach told the Guardian in an interview that the failings of the prosecution in Lucio’s case had shaken his belief in the death penalty. He said her treatment had “given me great pause and made me reconsider my stance on whether this is the way we want to do things in the state of Texas”. Leach has been at the forefront of efforts by Texas lawmakers to persuade the authorities to postpone the execution. He orchestrated a letter to the board of pardons signed by 80 House members, 32 of whom are Republican. A similar letter has been sent by 20 Texas senators, eight Republican. In the House letter, the lawmakers pointed out that Lucio was treated by prosecutors in a completely different way to her husband, who was also responsible for Mariah’s care. Lucio had no previous history of violence and her children said she had never been abusive towards them; by contrast her husband had a history of assault yet is now a free man having only served a four-year sentence for child endangerment. The extent of bipartisan agreement, with more than half the legislature backing calls for a stay, is extremely rare in such a riven state.",News/US news,Texas death row prisoner Melissa Lucio granted stay of execution,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/25/melissa-lucio-stay-of-execution-texas
4/26/2022,"Sajid Javid is being urged to change the law to let pharmacists alter prescriptions during medicine shortages, as it emerged that some women are travelling hundreds of miles to seek hormone replacement therapy products. There have been acute shortages of some HRT products, which are used by about 1 million women in the UK to treat symptoms of the menopause. Claire Anderson, the president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said community pharmacists should be able to dispense substitute versions of medicines on prescription without having to contact the prescriber – typically a GP – every time. Currently, the law in England stipulates they must provide only the exact prescription. The proposed shake-up would also let pharmacists make changes to quantities, strength and formulation of HRT and other medicines dispensed. “At the moment pharmacists cannot amend prescriptions for HRT, so have to refer women back to their GPs when a medicine is not available,” Anderson said. “Enabling pharmacists to do so will save time for patients, pharmacists and doctors, as well as lessening the anxiety for women waiting for medicines.” On Sunday Javid announced plans to appoint a HRT tsar to get to grips with the shortages. The number of HRT products prescribed in England has more doubled in the last five years, contributing to stocks running low, while manufacturers have reported supply problems. Some women are sharing their prescriptions or travelling hundreds of miles to source products, and there are fears that some women may be becoming suicidal as a result of their symptoms going untreated. Anderson said she welcomed Javid’s plan to recruit a HRT tsar, but she added: “With continued concerns from patient groups about medicines supply for people with other conditions, this appointment must be part of a wider government strategy to ensure patient access to medicines.” She said: “Pharmacists spend many hours dealing with medicines shortages when we’d rather be talking to patients about their care. One solution would be to enable pharmacists to make minor changes to a prescription when something is out of stock. This is faster for patients and more efficient for the NHS. “Difficulties in accessing HRT unfairly impacts women, affects their mental health and worsens health inequalities – this is an area that not only impacts our patients but also the health and care workforce.” The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC), which represents NHS community pharmacies in England, said demand was outstripping supply for a small number of HRT medicines, and longer, 12-month prescriptions were exacerbating the situation. “Disruptions to medicines supply can fluctuate very rapidly and on a very localised basis,” a PSNC spokesperson said. “The situation is very variable depending on demand, local prescribing and existing stock levels in pharmacies, and it is difficult to gain a snapshot of where supply is sitting as it is constantly moving through the supply chain. “We know that some pharmacies are receiving HRT prescriptions from women and prescribers hundreds of miles away, but we don’t have anything to confirm whether there is any significant regional variation in supplies.” Janet Morrison, the chief executive of the PSNC, said: “The current disruption to supplies of some HRT medicines appears to only be affecting a small number of medicines, and most pharmacies report that they are able to help women in need of medication quickly. “The disruption appears to be being driven by sudden increases in demand for some medicines, and by some prescriptions being written for much longer periods than is usual. “It is incredibly worrying for women if they are not able to access medicines that they rely on. Pharmacies teams know this, and they will do all that they can to help. In many cases, other formulations may be available, although this can take a little time for pharmacies to sort out as they will need to speak to your GP first.” The Labour MP Carolyn Harris, a co-chair of the UK menopause taskforce, welcomed ministers’ promises to address the shortages. She said: “The trouble with the menopause is for far too long women have not been listened to, women have been ignored, they’ve been prescribed and diagnosed with other conditions and the menopause wasn’t even considered.”",News/Society,Sajid Javid urged to relax law as women forced to travel miles to find HRT,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/25/calls-to-relax-pharmacy-rules-amid-hrt-shortages-in-england
4/26/2022,"Battered and bruised, France’s “republican front” did its job once more in Sunday’s presidential election runoff. Faced with the prospect of a far-right takeover of the Élysée, a sufficient number of voters put aside their reservations regarding Emmanuel Macron and made him the first president to win a second term in office for 20 years. In the end, Mr Macron’s 58%-42% victory over Marine Le Pen was much more comfortable than seemed likely a few weeks ago, when some polls predicted a knife-edge contest. For France – and the rest of Europe – the alternative outcome would have been disastrous and destabilising. Ms Le Pen’s authoritarian, nationalist and xenophobic vision would have led to civil strife domestically and undermined solidarity between western democracies at a vital time. That Mr Macron successfully averted this worst-case scenario is a cause for celebration. But as his victory speech on Sunday night tacitly acknowledged, an election won with the help of the fear factor has delivered an exceptionally fragile mandate. Describing France as riven by doubt and division, Mr Macron pledged to be “not the candidate of one camp, but the president of all of us”. Such assurances are commonplace from victorious political leaders, but it is vital that Mr Macron makes good on them during a second term, which looks challenging to say the least. As the election laid bare, France is dangerously divided along economic and generational fault lines. A majority of blue-collar workers – and more than four in 10 voters overall – opted for Ms Le Pen. This, the best score in the history of the French far right, allowed Ms Le Pen to declare her share of the vote a “victory in itself”. Disturbingly, it indicates that the normalisation of her movement is all but complete. Mr Macron’s core vote, by contrast, came from wealthy business people, middle-class professionals and retired people. Younger, well educated but economically precarious voters who supported the radical left candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, in the first round were left without a dog in the fight. Reflecting widespread disillusionment with the choice on offer, particularly among the young, the rate of abstention was the highest for a presidential runoff since 1969. Among potential voters under the age of 25, more than 40% failed to cast a ballot. Enough voters on the left lent their support to Mr Macron to keep the far right out of power, but in fewer numbers than in 2017. Hostilities on the right and the left will now be resumed ahead of parliamentary elections in June. If he is to successfully navigate this volatile political landscape, Mr Macron will need to adopt a radically different playbook from the one that characterised his first five years in the Élysée. During that time, he acquired a reputation as the “president of the rich” after watering down a wealth tax, pursuing unpopular pension reforms and imposing a fuel tax that sparked the gilets jaunes movement. An autocratic style contributed to the widespread impression that Mr Macron’s declared intention to transform and liberalise the French economy would be accomplished at the expense of the less well-off. To make good on his aspirations to reach out across the divides, Mr Macron will need to do far more to address such concerns and insecurities. During a campaign that became unexpectedly close, there were signs that this was being recognised. In an encouraging early statement of intent, it has already been signalled that there will be full consultation with unions and other bodies over proposals to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65. As the cost-of-living crisis bites, in a still fragile post-Covid economy, Mr Macron should also recognise that more needs to be done to protect and improve the living standards of blue-collar workers and the youthful precariat, which voted en masse for Mr Mélenchon. As he contemplates five more years in office, Mr Macron must realise that he has been given not so much a mandate as another chance.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Macron’s victory: a fragile mandate | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/25/the-guardian-view-on-macrons-victory-a-fragile-mandate
4/26/2022,"New evidence of the extent of the privatisation of mental healthcare in England is extremely concerning. Ministers and health bosses must explain why the independent sector is earning almost £2bn a year for treating patients with psychiatric conditions – or 13.5% of NHS England’s entire mental health budget. Overall, about 7% of spending is on private providers, although this rose during the pandemic. It is difficult to think of a good reason why the proportion of mentally unwell people treated by private providers should be so much higher than the proportion of those with other conditions. If patient safety and care quality were the only considerations, extremely vulnerable mental health patients would seem to be among the least suitable candidates for outsourcing. After all, the general rule is that while standardised treatments such as cataract operations can be delivered via the independent sector relatively straightforwardly, more complex and long-term work is kept in-house. Why inpatient psychiatric care for under-18s should defy this rule, with 55% of all NHS-funded treatment delivered privately, is a troubling question for anyone who cares about the future of healthcare. The short answer, of course, is that the NHS does not have the resources or the staff to do this work itself. This leaves doctors and managers with no choice, as one psychiatrist described at the weekend. Years of underinvestment in the health service have hit the mental health sector hard. Currently, there are 10,123 private mental health beds in England (the NHS has 17,610) and private mental health providers earn 91% of their income from the NHS. But psychiatrists, the Care Quality Commission and NHS England’s national mental health director, Claire Murdoch, have all raised concerns about the quality of the care on offer. In 2019, the Priory group was fined £300,000 over failings that led to the death of a 14-year-old girl, Amy El-Keria. Last week, an inquest jury found that neglect contributed to the death of Matthew Caseby in another Priory facility. But there needs to be a longer answer too – one that addresses the underlying question of why, with average profit margins of 15%-20%, it has been made so easy to make money out of acute psychological distress. Also, whether the health and care bill that is on its way through parliament will lead to improvements or to further fragmentation, as the British Medical Association has warned that it could. Comparisons of the patient safety records of public and private providers are made difficult by a lack of data. Recent evidence has revealed grave failings in NHS hospitals too. But one doesn’t have to pretend that all is well in the public sector to reject as shameful the situation whereby businesses are enabled to make huge profits from delivering substandard care with weak oversight and minimal accountability. Patients and their families deserve better.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on mental health privatisation: unsafe spaces | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/25/the-guardian-view-on-mental-health-privatisation-unsafe-spaces
4/26/2022,"On the fourth and final day of the cross-examination of Johnny Depp in his defamation case against his former wife, Amber Heard, jurors were presented with audio recording in which the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise actor appeared to warn Heard of violence if their arguments escalated. “The next move, if I don’t walk away … it’s going to be a bloodbath, like it was on the island,” Depp said on the recording played in court. The 58-year-old actor could also be discerned shouting “Shut up, fat a**” after Heard told him to “put your cigarettes out on someone else! You f***ing have consequences for your actions!” But Depp’s lawyers later played a tape in which Heard said to her husband, “I want couch. By the way, you just threw a f**king cigarette on me.” Asked what the exchange meant, Depp explained “it’s pretty clear she’s ordering me on the couch”. He acknowledged he may have flicked cigarette ash at her. “She’s not screaming in pain as if I put a cigarette out on her”, adding any suggestion he had was “ridiculous”. Ben King, a British house manager-butler employed by Disney to manage the couple’s rented house in Australia, described overhearing an argument in which Heard said, “Why’d you take your hand away from me, Johnny? Don’t you love me anymore?” “I think he replied, ‘Of course I do, don’t be silly.’” King continued, and described Heard’s tone as “like a spoiled teenage child”. After a marital argument escalated, King testified that he found Depp’s severed fingertip “directly below the bar”. But in other exchanges in the Alexandria, Virginia, courtroom on Monday, Depp wrote to his former wife’s mother describing himself as a “poor old junkie” who depended on his wife and her family. “What you do need to know [is] that your daughter has risen far above the nightmarish task of taking care of this poor old junkie. Never a second has gone by that she didn’t look out for me, to have her eyes on me to make sure that I was OK,” he wrote, the court heard. “She has the strength of a thousand men,” Depp added in the note. The exchange came close to the end of Heard’s attorneys’ opportunity, with Depp on the witness stand, to paint the actor as a violent domestic abuser whose behavior was integral to dependencies on drugs and alcohol. The actor has described the accusations of substance abuse as “grossly embellished” and argued it was Heard who escalated their fights to violence. In one recording, Depp and Heard could be heard negotiating time-outs to their disputes, with Heard saying she could not trust her husband to resume their discussions. “How can I trust you that it will be a few minutes when you’ve done this in the past and disappeared for hours?” Heard says. “In arguments you tend to throw punches,” Depp says. “I’m talking arguments, not the times when it’s physical,” Heard responds. “You take off right away. You don’t deal with the issue. You don’t deal with the confrontation. And you split. You do for an indeterminate amount of time. You do it without actually respecting me.” Under questioning from his own lawyers, Depp was asked how he felt about the article Heard wrote for the Washington Post describing herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse” two years after she’d been granted a restraining order against him for throwing a cell phone. “At that point it had been a good two solid years since the allegations had been planted firmly on my back,” Depp testified. “I couldn’t believe it … it was clear that, the more hit pieces came out on me, it was clear that Ms Heard’s righteous chase against me was continuing.” “Something had to be done,” he said, referring to bringing the defamation complaint in Virginia. “I couldn’t take it anymore.” Depp said he felt he had no opportunity to address the allegations against him, and by then Disney had dropped him from the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. “It hurt, like somebody hit me in the head with a two-by-four. Even if I tried to do an interview to explain myself, it turned into a hit piece.” On Monday, a recording was played of Depp and Heard discussing how to manage domestic violence claims that were already in the press. “I don’t know how to get my, um, reputation back,” Heard says. Depp suggested they write a joint letter saying they love each other and blaming the media for creating a storm. Earlier, Heard’s attorney, Ben Rottenborn, had shown Depp negative news articles he said would show that the actor’s bad press preceded the 2018 Washington Post article at the center of the case. “I’ve been in the racket of Hollywood since 1984 … of course people write negative stories,” Depp countered. Depp also explained that his texts to his actor friend Paul Bettany in which he’d said “Let’s drown her before we burn her. I will f*** her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she’s dead” were never “intended to be real”. The text about burning Heard, he said, was directly from Monty Python and the sketch about burning witches and then drowning the witches. “This is a film we’d all watch when we were 10 – it’s just irreverent and abstract humor.” The actor told the jury that when he used the term “monster” it was his term to describe himself when he’d relapsed out of addiction recovery, or failed to attain sobriety. In his arguments with Heard, he said that when the tenor of the exchanges was reduced to scream obscenities, “the monster was just, for me, was a guy who’s dumb enough to take part in arguments that would ultimately went nowhere.” For both plaintiff and defendant, much of the legal trial has been about establishing probability that their account makes the alleged defamation seem more feasible or unlikely. Much of what has been heard is not directly relevant to the alleged libel but offered as background that could ultimately decide the fate and the reputations of the parties. The case continues.",Arts/Film,Johnny Depp warns Amber Heard of violence in recording played in court,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/25/johnny-depp-amber-heard-defamation-trial-court-latest
4/26/2022,"Five months after special administrators were appointed at Bulb in an act of quasi-nationalisation, the government is discovering a few truths that should have been obvious on day one. There isn’t a long queue of would-be buyers willing to pay good money for a failed energy supplier with 1.7 million customers when wholesale markets are still in turmoil. Taxpayers’ financial exposure is only increasing with every passing month. And semi-state ownership brings some level of ministerial responsibility for how the business is run, including the inexplicable decision to continue paying Hayden Wood, cofounder and chief executive, his £250,000 salary as if nothing had happened. “We do not want this company to be in this temporary state longer than is absolutely necessary,” Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, told parliament last November when announcing the administration. The initial advance of £1.7bn of public money was intended to cover Bulb’s working capital requirements for six months, which seemed to be the soft deadline for getting rid of the problem. That deadline is unlikely to be met, though a summer exit is still possible. However, neither interested party named by the Sunday Times can be regarded as unproblematic. Passing Bulb to Centrica, the owner of British Gas, would entrench the market leader’s dominance and, even in an emergency that has demonstrated the benefit of having well-capitalised suppliers that don’t fall over, ministers are still supposed to have half an eye on long-term competition. The other reported runner is Masdar, out of Abu Dhabi, which offers no experience of the UK retail energy market. Other parties could still emerge, but the burning question is whether a “sale” of Bulb would merit the term. Centrica is said to want taxpayer support for an unknown period to cover the cost of buying energy for Bulb’s customers, a demand that seems entirely sensible on its part. Current wholesale prices equate to £1,000 above today’s price cap. If the difference means losses for Centrica, its shareholders surely wouldn’t tolerate a deal without a dowry. The government’s plan B, one assumes, is a break-up of Bulb, with the customers parcelled out around the current main players. That process would be fiddly, but Kwarteng would be wise not to dismiss it; it may be needed to clear a developing political headache. In the meantime, he should ask if the public purse is getting value from the administrator, Teneo. Handing bonuses to staff to prevent a wave of resignations is theoretically defensible, but where’s the evidence that Bulb was in danger of imploding? As for Wood’s generous retainer, there is no justification. Calls for a shareholder rebellion at Just Eat Takeaway (JET) are in order for the reasons outlined here last week. This is the delivery company that over-ordered in destructive fashion for its investors: it attempted to consume Grubhub of the US before it had digested the merger of Takeaway.com of the Netherlands and Just Eat of the UK. The shares have fallen 75% since the $7.3bn (£5.7bn) Grubhub deal was unveiled in June 2020. So, yes, Cat Rock Capital, with a 6.9% stake, is right to demand a clear-out of the supervisory board that has overseen the calamity. But, among the executives, it feels perverse to target the finance boss, Brent Wissink, while slapping an “abstain” recommendation on the chief executive, Jitse Groen. The argument seems to be the idea that Grubhub was a “capital allocation mistake”, but, if so, the mistake was primarily Groen’s. He is the founder of the business, the architect of the rapid acquisition strategy and the person who publicly defended the Grubhub deal. Groen’s stake is as large as Cat Rock’s, which makes him harder to oust; and separating him from his loyal number-counter may send a useful corrective message. Ultimately, though, JET is Groen’s creation and he’s the man who should be in the spotlight. Even before Elon Musk’s $44bn purchase of Twitter was confirmed on Monday evening, one could say that the board’s devious “poison pill” defence was a waste of time. A threat to flood the market with discounted shares advertised weakness because it suggested the directors couldn’t assemble a decent argument based on creating more value independently. Far from buying time, the move seems only to have encouraged Twitter’s major shareholders to lobby the board to get to the negotiating table. In the process, Musk has avoided scrutiny over how he would run Twitter, which is the core issue for anyone who cares about the quality of public discourse. The poison pill was a self-defeating distraction.",News/Business,The only easy decision for Bulb’s future: stop paying its CEO,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/25/the-only-easy-decision-for-bulbs-future-stop-paying-its-ceo
4/26/2022,"The UK’s top civil servant has privately warned Boris Johnson against forcing government workers back to the office amid growing anger in Whitehall over “scare tactics”, the Guardian has learned. Alongside Simon Case, at least four permanent secretaries – the most senior civil servants in their department – are also understood to have raised alarm over government rhetoric designed to reverse the shift to working-from-home arrangements during the Covid pandemic. Spot checks on office working by Jacob Rees-Mogg, including “sorry you were out when I visited” notes left on empty Whitehall desks, have seen the Cabinet Office minister branded “the milk monitor” by disgruntled officials. Case told the prime minister over the weekend that Rees-Mogg’s strategy was unwise and that the language against civil servants was going too far. A No 10 source said Case was fully on board with a return to more face-to-face working. On Monday No 10 backed Rees-Mogg’s approach amid a rift with Nadine Dorries over the office working drive, which the culture secretary had labelled “Dickensian”. Rees-Mogg had written to cabinet ministers urging them to coerce staff into a “rapid return to the office” and has been leaving notes for absent civil servants with the message: “I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon.” Among the rooms where he left calling cards was the national security secretariat in the Cabinet Office, causing particular disquiet in Whitehall because staff were under intense pressure in that unit, where they work on sensitive material. A government source said Rees-Mogg often had to move through other departments to get to his office at 100 Parliament Street, adding: “He is wholly focused on parts of the government under his control, not other ministers’ areas.” The minister, who is responsible for government efficiencies, presented figures to cabinet last week showing that some government departments were using 25% of office capacity in early April. Dorries’ Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) was at 43%. Rees-Mogg is understood to have done walkabouts at several government offices, including DCMS. During a visit to the Treasury, the Guardian was told he commented to one official that “you’re the first person I’ve seen working on this floor today”. He also visited the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and was unimpressed with the amount of empty desks so sent senior its officials a letter asking when they were going to shut the office given its apparent lack of use, sources said. But the Guardian understands the “threat” not to renew the lease has been abandoned. It was derided as a “scare tactic” to force teams across the government estate to justify using their space. A government source said: “The SFO have had a short-term reprieve and had their long-term requests for renewal denied by two separate ministers.” Several permanent secretaries have also privately voiced frustrations at Rees-Mogg’s “stunt”. An official working at one of Whitehall’s biggest departments said their director of communications had advised: “ignore him”. Another Whitehall source said civil service managers had promoted flexible working, with the expectation of spending one to two days a week in the office. On the civil service jobs site on Monday, more than 1,600 jobs were advertised as having flexible working arrangements. The disquiet at Rees-Mogg’s strategy also extends to ministers. One said: “I’m on team Nadine [Dorries] on this one. Who dreams this crap up? If the civil service aren’t working properly, reform them. Don’t wander round placing the physical equivalent of eye rolls on their desks.” Another Whitehall official said the push was creating a sense of injustice and warned that, coupled with a pay freeze, it would affect staff retention leading to “the worst brain drain I have ever seen”, with talented younger staff seeking to leave. They also pointed to the treatment of junior staff in No 10 and the Cabinet Office over the Partygate scandal, where civil servants have received or expect to receive fines for attending events with the prime minister or senior bosses. Dave Penman, general secretary of the civil service union FDA, said: “I am getting lots from members saying they have had enough and they are going to go. They are not going to be treated like this. “Ultimately civil servants will put up with what’s going on with cost of living and a significantly below inflation pay rise – but not this. It is so demoralising for civil servants because it’s not actually based on anything to do with their work and the best way to deliver public services.” A government spokesperson said: “There is total agreement across government on there being clear benefits from face-to-face, collaborative working and we know that this is particularly important for the learning and development of new and junior members of staff. The minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency has written to departments to underline the importance of workplace attendance and request that they review their existing guidance on the minimum number of days staff work in the office.” Asked if Johnson backed Rees-Mogg’s policy of leaving calling cards at vacant desks, the spokesperson said: “What the minister is seeking to achieve is to do everything possible to get the civil service to return to the pre-pandemic level … That is supported by the cabinet secretary and obviously the prime minister.” Referring to the notes left on desks, Johnson “supports any initiative that encourages people to return to pre-pandemic working”, the spokesperson said. “We are not talking about putting an end to flexible working, which continues to have a place in the modern workplace, we are talking about returning to pre-pandemic use of taxpayer-funded departmental buildings.”",News/Politics,Civil service head warns PM against forcing Whitehall workers back to office,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/civil-service-head-warns-pm-against-forcing-whitehall-workers-back-to-office

The foreign affairs select committee is investigating leaked emails from Foreign Office staff that say Lovegrove directed that the Nowzad staff be evacuated after consulting No 10 last August. Downing Street had previously insisted Boris Johnson and his wife, Carrie, did not intervene on behalf of their friend Pen Farthing, the charity’s founder, to airlift dogs out of Kabul while people died. The decision caused huge media controversy at the time, but Johnson said it was nonsense to suggest he intervened. Lovegrove told the committee on Monday that the Foreign Office leaked email was based on a plausible but incorrect assumption that he had consulted No 10. He said he acted after the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, tweeted at 1.15am on 25 August saying: “Now that Pen Farthing’s Nowzad staff have been cleared to come forward, I have authorised MoD to facilitate their processing.” Lovegrove said the issue was raised at a meeting at 10am that day and he checked with his national security secretariat whether the Nowzad staff were eligible by being on the “leave outside the rules” list, comprising deserving cases that did not meet other criteria. He told the committee he could not precisely remember with whom he checked “in a very complex and fraught environment”, but said he would have remembered if he had checked with either the prime minister or the defence secretary. Lovegrove said he did not know why Wallace posted the tweet, but he said it must have been due to a decision being relayed to him by Permanent Joint Headquarters, the military command. Wallace himself has said he received no instruction from No 10. Lovegrove said one of three cabinet ministers would have approved Nowzad staff being included on the “leave outside the rules” list on 21 August. Emails released by the foreign affairs committee cited an official in the office of Zac Goldsmith, a Foreign Office minister and close friend of Carrie Johnson, telling an official in his department that “the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated”. That official later sent another message to other civil servants saying: “Having regard to the prime minister’s Nowzad decision, the foreign secretary might consider the [details redacted] vets and their dependents should be included. They might be able to get to the airport with their dependents in time.”",News/World news,Security chief denies consulting No 10 over Afghanistan charity evacuation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/security-chief-denies-consulting-no-10-over-afghanistan-charity-evacuation
4/26/2022,"A senior barrister who repeated discredited police allegations about the behaviour of Liverpool supporters at the Hillsborough disaster has been cleared of misconduct by his profession’s Bar Standards Board (BSB). Jonathan Goldberg QC made his remarks last May in a BBC interview after the collapse of the final Hillsborough-related criminal trial, claiming that late-arriving Liverpool supporters had caused “a riot” at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough, and crushed “innocents” who had arrived early. Goldberg also made a speech outside the court, where he had represented Peter Metcalf, the then South Yorkshire police solicitor, who was acquitted of perverting the course of justice for advising that dozens of police officers’ written accounts should be amended. Goldberg described the prosecution of Metcalf and two former South Yorkshire police officers as “a witch-hunt”, and said the money spent on criminal investigations into the disaster and its aftermath “would have been better spent on building new hospitals or schools, perhaps in Liverpool”. Many relatives of the 97 men, women and children killed at Hillsborough, and the mayors of Liverpool city region and Greater Manchester, Steve Rotheram and Andy Burnham, complained to the BSB about Goldberg’s remarks. The evidence of South Yorkshire police officers, accusing Liverpool supporters of drunkenness and blaming them for the disaster, has been repeatedly rejected: by Lord Justice Taylor in his 1989 public inquiry; by the Hillsborough Independent Panel in 2012; by three senior judges, including the lord chief justice, when they quashed the first inquest in 2012; and by the jury at the 2014-16 inquest. The BSB decided, however, that Goldberg had not breached the professional standards expected of barristers, and said it remained “reasonable”, protected as a matter of free speech, for somebody “in good faith” to repeat the original police allegations. Bereaved families, survivors and supporters fought through three decades to disprove the police allegations, and against the 1991 first inquest verdict of accidental death. The new inquest jury determined in 2016 that the then 96 victims were all unlawfully killed due to gross negligence manslaughter by David Duckenfield, the South Yorkshire police officer in command at Hillsborough. Having heard the police allegations against the supporters extensively, the jury fully rejected them, and determined that no behaviour of Liverpool supporters contributed to the disaster. Duckenfield was acquitted of gross negligence manslaughter in 2019, after a trial at which his barrister again highlighted allegations of misbehaviour against supporters. Goldberg said in his BBC interview that Liverpool fans’ behaviour was “perfectly appalling on the day, causing a riot”, and that those people, let in by police through an exit gate at 2:52pm, “crushed to death … complete innocents, who were at the front of the [terrace] pens, who had arrived early and were not drunk and were behaving perfectly well”. Although some police officers originally propounded that narrative, that the people who died were all in the ground early, the 2016 inquest found by tracking their movements that 30 of the 96 had themselves come through the exit gate at 2:52pm. However, in its decision clearing Goldberg, the BSB said it was “reasonable” for him to repeat the police case, even though there remains “significant controversy” about it, and that the right of free speech allows somebody to criticise legal findings. “The [BSB] panel were of the view that it cannot be said, especially in light of the contemporaneous police accounts, that no reasonable person in the position of Mr Goldberg can in good faith have formed the view that he expressed.” Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, 18, died at Hillsborough, said families and survivors had fought for 30 years and “the truth has been proved”. “But it’s no surprise that they cleared him because as we’ve found, the establishment protects its own,” she said. Goldberg declined to retract his remarks or apologise after the uproar last year, instead issuing a “clarification”, saying he had not intended to express those views as his own, and was not endorsing the police case. The BSB said that they did not make any finding on that, because they had decided that Goldberg was entitled to express that view anyway.",Sport/Football,Bar Standards Board clears barrister over Hillsborough remarks,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/25/bar-standards-board-clears-barrister-over-hillsborough-remarks
4/26/2022,"The main private mental health hospital chains that treat NHS patients have been criticised by coroners and inquest juries dozens of times over the last decade for providing unsafe care. The Priory, Cygnet and Elysium have been censured at least 37 times for mistakes and lapses in care that were involved in the deaths of patients, including several children. After hearing evidence in court, coroners or inquest juries have identified serious failings in the care given to 23 patients who died while being treated at a Priory hospital since 2012, 11 who were in a Cygnet facility and three who were residents in an Elysium unit. They have found the same mistakes happening again and again at private units. Key failings have included staff not observing potentially suicidal patients properly, ignoring relatives’ concerns about the danger of suicide, and wrongly assessing that risk. The Guardian disclosed on Sunday that the three firms earn more than half of the £2bn a year that the NHS in England now spends outsourcing mental health care because it has too few beds. Deborah Coles, the director of the charity Inquest, which monitors the deaths of people while mental health inpatients, said: “The same basic failings are leading to preventable deaths of men, women and children. Persistent issues including with risk assessments, observations, ligature points and communication amongst staff or with families are costing lives. “For years inspections, inquests and investigations have repeatedly exposed neglect and harmful practices. Yet the NHS continues to commission these providers, at significant public expense.” In some cases the coroner has been so concerned by the evidence they have heard that they have issued a prevention of future deaths (PFD) notice – a legal warning to a public or private entity to make urgent changes to reduce the risk of someone else dying in the same circumstances. On Monday Louise Hunt, the senior coroner for Birmingham, issued a PFD ordering the Priory to make a series of changes following the death in September 2020 of 23-year-old Matthew Caseby, who died after absconding over a fence at the back of its hospital in Birmingham. The Priory had taken no action despite a previous absconsion over the same fence in October 2019. Hunt also advised the Department of Health and Social Care to bring in national guidelines for the height of perimeter fences and security in the outside areas of acute mental health units. Last month an inquest jury found that 17-year-old Chelsea Blue Mooney had died in April 2021 “as a result of insufficient care, crucially inadequate observations and the delays in emergency response” at the Cygnet hospital in Sheffield. Last November, at the inquest into the death in 2019 of 16-year-old Nadia Shah at the Potters Bar Clinic in Hertfordshire run by Elysium, the jury found it was due to “misadventure contributed to by the inadequate care at the Potters Bar Clinic”. They cited six specific flaws, including mistakes in observation and “a failure to adequately report observations to properly inform assessment of risk”. It is unknown how many times NHS mental health trusts have been criticised by coroners or juries over the same period. However, in 2019 the Care Quality Commission, the NHS watchdog, said there was a “disparity in performance” on safety between private and NHS mental health units. The Priory said that the figures for the 23 occasions on which it has been censured by a coroner or inquest were “misleading and presented without any context”. It added: “Priory, as the UK’s largest independent mental health provider, has safely and successfully treated tens of thousands of patients over the last 10 years, as a trusted partner to the NHS. Deaths are extremely rare.” A Cygnet spokesperson said: “Any incident in which a service user has died is heartbreaking for everyone involved. Care for people with mental health conditions is challenging and our staff work incredibly hard to ensure the safety and wellbeing of those in our care.” Cygnet learns lessons from every death to prevent further fatalities, they added. In a statement Elysium said: “Over the last six years, tragically a small number of deaths have occurred in our high acuity services and our thoughts remain with each affected family. On the occasions when inquests into these deaths have made important recommendations we have acted swiftly and decisively.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

4/26/2022,"Caroline Sharp believed that when her daughter Emma Pring was admitted for treatment at the private Cygnet hospital in Maidstone, it would be a turning point in her daughter’s life. “In some ways it was my naivety, but I really did think she was getting the best care,” Sharp says. During the inquest to establish how and why her daughter died while an inpatient at the hospital, and after hearing the evidence given by the staff, Sharp remembers thinking: “How on earth did I let my daughter go there?” Sharp says her daughter was fundamentally a “lovely, lively, cheeky little girl”. “She was just so lovely to everybody she met,” she says. “And even when she started having her own difficulties, she just had so many friends that she would put over and above herself. I mean, just by looking at her Facebook page, the number of tributes and the number of people who still send her messages now, just really shows how she would always put everybody else first, often to her own detriment.” The difficulties Pring experienced refers to the struggles she had with her mental health, which included depression, borderline personality disorder and PTSD which was triggered when she was raped twice at the age of 18. In April 2016, Pring’s mental health began to further decline and she began to receive care from Sussex partnership NHS trust, left her job as a nursery nurse, and was eventually detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act. In July 2020, Pring was transferred, by the NHS trust, to the Roseacre ward at Cygnet in Maidstone, for what was meant to be long-term, specialist treatment. As a patient at the hospital, Pring received a type of trauma therapy which involved reliving what happened to her at 18, a therapy which Sharp said her daughter was “terrified” of beginning. In February 2021, although communication to her daughter was limited, Sharp says that a few days before her daughter’s death she told her mother that she wanted her to bring her home. “I said, Ems, you’re under a section 3, I’m not allowed. I can’t just do that.” Pring killed herself on 20 April 2021, aged 29. An inquest into her death, which concluded last month, found it could have been prevented by the hospital, with the jury finding there had been an “insufficient level of observation, and a misjudgment of Emma’s actual risk”. Rather than being placed on one-to-one observations that might have prevented her death, Pring was supposed to have been observed by staff every 15 minutes, a timeframe which the inquest found was not always adhered to. Cygnet’s own “root cause analysis” report found that if Pring had been placed on one-to-one observations it is likely that she would not have died. The coroner is also considering whether to issue a prevention of future deaths notice to Cygnet hospitals. Her daughter’s death has also led Sharp to question why her NHS trust was unable to provide care for mental health patients themselves, rather than contracting beds at private hospitals. “Why aren’t the NHS able to [provide this care] themselves?,” Sharp asks. “Why are there no placements on the NHS? Why are we relying so heavily on private healthcare to provide something like this?’” There have been at least 20 deaths of patients, aside from Pring, at Cygnet hospitals across the UK since 2011. Inquest, which has been tracking these deaths, believes they are concerning. Following the death of 17-year-old Chelsea Blue Mooney at a Cygnet hospital in Sheffield in April 2021, the same month that Pring died, an inquest found that “insufficient care” at the hospital had led to her death. For Sharp, hearing the jury’s conclusion at the inquest, that her daughter’s death could have been prevented and that there were failures at Cygnet hospital was “difficult to process”. “It’s just, really really difficult to come to terms with, and to know, that your daughter was failed by the people that should have been looking after her,” Sharp says. A Cygnet spokesperson said: “We would like to express our deepest condolences to Emma’s family and friends. Our thoughts remain with them. “We take the safety and wellbeing of our service users extremely seriously, and the recommendations from our review have been shared locally and across the organisation to ensure lessons learnt are identified and shared.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

4/26/2022,"The Texas Republican spearheading an extraordinary bipartisan effort to delay Wednesday’s execution of a Mexican American woman amid mounting evidence of her innocence has described the case as “the most troubling I’ve ever seen, possibly the most troubling in the history of our state”. In an interview with the Guardian, Jeff Leach, a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives, said that even strong supporters of the death penalty – as he once considered himself – had great concern about the rapidly approaching execution. Melissa Lucio, 52, is scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection for killing her two-year-old daughter Mariah, but new scientific evidence suggests the toddler died accidentally after a fall. Leach said that a possibly innocent woman was “about to be – let’s not mince words – murdered by the state”. He said that the numerous missteps made in the prosecution of Lucio had given him “great pause” that was forcing him to reconsider his support of capital punishment. “I’m not ashamed to say I believed in the death penalty for the most heinous cases. But this case is shaking my confidence in the system. It has failed Melissa and the victim of the tragedy, Mariah, at every turn,” he said. The lawmaker had strong words to say about the agonizing wait Lucio is enduring in her final hours before her scheduled execution. “It’s barbaric,” Leach said. “There’s no reason for it. They’ve had all the information they need for weeks – someone just has to step up and make the right decision.” The Republican lawmaker ran through a litany of prosecution failures. He said: “If it was just the interrogation, or just one piece of new scientific evidence, or only one juror and not five who have now said they regret their decision, then we could talk. But when you have all of these things where the system has failed, then that causes great alarm.” Leach’s comments came as Lucio’s battle to save her own life entered its final feverish hours. Her lawyers are fighting on several fronts in the hope of securing a stay of execution. On Monday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles is meeting to discuss the Lucio case, and its recommendation will then be passed to the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, for his final say. Abbott has the power to put a hold on the execution, grant Lucio clemency or let the process proceed to the death chamber. Legal appeals have also been lodged with a local district court in Cameron county and in the Texas court of criminal appeals in Austin. A new filing on Monday reprised the many inconsistencies in the prosecution case, including evidence that Lucio’s confession was forced and that Mariah died as a result of injuries sustained when she fell down a steep flight of stairs and not at her mother’s hands. Leach has been at the forefront of efforts by Texas lawmakers to persuade the authorities to postpone the execution. He orchestrated a letter to the board of pardons signed by 80 House members, 32 of whom are Republican. A similar letter has been sent by 20 Texas senators, eight Republican. In the House letter, the lawmakers pointed out that Lucio was treated by prosecutors in a completely different way from her husband, who was also responsible for Mariah’s care. Lucio had no previous history of violence and her children said she had never been abusive towards them; by contract her husband had a history of assault yet is now a free man having only served a four-year sentence for child endangerment. The exceptional degree of bipartisan agreement, with more than half the legislature backing calls for a stay, is extremely rare in such a riven state. Leach, however, said he was unsurprised. “I know our country is pretty divided, and we have our fights,” he said. “But when something is as clear as this, I know my legislative colleagues on both sides of the aisle are willing to do the right thing.” Leach was one of several Texas lawmakers who visited Lucio earlier this month in the Mountain View Unit in Gatesville where the women’s death row is housed. He told the Guardian that they prayed together and he held her hand. “Her faith is incredibly strong. She is comforted by the prayers of millions across the world, so it was an amazing moment.” At the encounter, Lucio invited Leach to attend her execution on Wednesday should it go ahead. “If it does go forward, I will be there,” he said. “But I’m hoping that’s a trip I don’t have to make.”",News/US news,Texas Republican urges halt to ‘most troubling’ Melissa Lucio execution,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/25/melissa-lucio-execution-jeff-leach-opposition-republican
4/26/2022,"The UK government has defended a decision to pay millions of pounds in bonuses to staff at the collapsed energy supplier Bulb, despite the fact that it has been effectively nationalised as part of a bailout that could cost taxpayers £2.2bn. Quarterly “retention bonuses” were deemed necessary to prevent an exodus of staff that could have scuppered efforts to keep the business afloat while a buyer is found, multiple sources familiar with the situation said. “The alternative is that hundreds of people leave and you won’t be able to sell it,” one Whitehall source said. “You can’t provide energy to people if there’s nobody working at the company.” Bulb Energy, which has more than 1.5 million customers, is currently run by the consultancy Teneo, appointed under the “special administration” scheme after the energy supplier became the largest of more than 20 to collapse under the weight of sky-high energy prices. The arrangement is the first test for a system designed to kick in when an energy supplier is too big for its customers to be transferred immediately to a rival. Under the arrangement, a court appointed Teneo to run the day-to-day operations on behalf of the government, which is funding the costs. The financial advisory firm Interpath has been drafted in to run Bulb’s parent company, Simple Energy. The decision to pay quarterly bonuses, first reported by the Financial Times, is understood to rest with Interpath because payroll is managed through Simple Energy. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Bulb’s administrators have set up an employee retention scheme in order to maintain operational effectiveness and support to customers. “The special administrator of Bulb remains legally obligated to keep costs of the administration process as low as possible – which the employee retention scheme is consistent with. “The government will seek to recoup costs at a later date, ensuring that we get maximum value for money for taxpayers.” The cost of running Bulb could reach £2.2bn, the Office for Budget Responsibility has said, while some reports have suggested £3bn is not unrealistic. A government source insisted that costs had not yet reached the £1.7bn initially set aside. The cost includes a heavily criticised £250,000 salary for Bulb’s boss and co-founder Hayden Wood, who has apologised for the company’s demise. A spokesperson for Interpath said: “The teams at Simple and Bulb have worked incredibly hard since the companies entered insolvency last November, ensuring the businesses have been able to continue to trade, and providing continuity of service for 1.5 million customers, and all against the backdrop of personal uncertainty that any administration inevitably causes.” The British Gas owner, Centrica, and the Abu Dhabi-based renewable energy firm Masdar are understood to be the frontrunners to buy Bulb Energy, with the government hoping that the investment bank Lazard can find a buyer by June. A further four parties have expressed interest, according to a Whitehall source, and could be called upon if Centrica and Masdar drop out.",News/Business,UK government defends bonuses paid to staff of collapsed firm Bulb,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/25/uk-government-defends-bonuses-paid-to-staff-of-collapsed-firm-bulb-energy
4/26/2022,"Priti Patel’s refugee pushback policy has been officially withdrawn by the government days before a judicial review of the tactic was due to be heard in the high court. The government’s legal department acknowledged in a letter on Sunday that the plan to try to force people in dinghies back to France has been abandoned after Boris Johnson’s announcement that the Royal Navy would take over operations in the Channel. Patel’s officials last week received notification that the Ministry of Defence, which is now in charge of picking up refugees in the Channel, did not have permission to use the tactic, the letter said. The policy, which was finalised in the autumn by the Home Office, authorised and encouraged Border Force officials to stop migrant vessels in UK waters and forcibly redirect them to return to France. In January, Patel said pushing back boats was “absolutely still policy” when she gave evidence to the House of Lords justice and home affairs committee. In its letter, the legal department said the policy and procedures had been withdrawn and that the MoD joint commander had not had permission to authorise the use of turnaround tactics. The letter, which was signed on behalf of the solicitor general, said a “significant development” had meant the case would no longer proceed. “That development flowed from the prime minister’s announcement on Thursday 14 April 2022 that the Ministry of Defence was taking over primacy in respect of Channel operations with regard to small boat crossings. As a result of a military order notified to the secretary of state for the home department’s officials earlier on 20 April 2022, the Ministry of Defence joint commander has not had permission to authorise the use of turnaround tactics,” the letter said. It said that if a decision were taken to use turnaround tactics in the future, it would only be after a full consideration of all relevant matters. “The secretary of state for the home department [Patel] has determined that: the policy and procedures, which are the subject of the ongoing litigation, are withdrawn; if a decision were taken to use turnaround tactics in the future, it would only be after a full consideration of all relevant matters, including the evolving nature of the small boats threat, migrant behaviour and organised criminal activity; and new policies, guidance and operational procedures would need to be formulated at that point.” Four organisations – the PCS union, Care4Calais, Channel Rescue and Freedom from Torture – had challenged the Home Office policy, with the applications set down for a three-day hearing on 3 May. The climbdown comes as the nationality and borders bill reaches its final stages in parliament. The Lords has twice rejected parts of the bill that would severely penalise refugees arriving in the UK without visas, in line with their rights under the refugee convention. Patel had repeatedly said there was a legal basis for the pushback policy despite introducing express powers to turn back boats in the nationality and borders bill on the basis that there was no such current legal power. The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “This humiliating climbdown by the government is a stunning victory for Home Office workers and for refugees. There is little doubt that lives have been saved. “The pushbacks manoeuvre is extremely dangerous and represents a clear risk to life and limb. We were simply not prepared to allow our members to be placed in this horrendous position.” Clare Moseley, the founder of Care4Calais, said: “I find it hard to believe that anyone within government thought that performing pushbacks in the Channel was a viable policy.” Sonya Sceats, the chief executive of Freedom from Torture, said: “This momentous climbdown by the government shows that change is possible when we come together. “But we should never have had to take this government to court in order to defend the sanctity of life – it is scandalous that it reached this point.” Steven Martin of Channel Rescue said: “Pushbacks are a reckless endangerment to life and we have always maintained and reminded the government that they are unlawful. The violent forcing back of people seeking protection is abhorrent and deprives them of their right to asylum.” The Guardian disclosed on Friday that unpublished parts of the proposed pushback policy said the tactic would not be used against asylum seekers. A government spokesperson said similar tactics might be deployed in the future, however these would only be used after full consideration of all relevant factors.“It is right that we consider all safe and legal options to stop these unnecessary journeys, including turning boats around.“As we have set out previously, this tactic fully complies with both domestic and international law, however, there are extremely limited circumstances when you can safely turn boats back in the Channel.”",News/UK news,Priti Patel’s refugee pushback policy withdrawn days before legal review,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/uk-refugee-pushback-policy-withdrawn-judicial-review-priti-patel
4/26/2022,"A Turkish court has sentenced a leading philanthropist to life imprisonment after finding him guilty of “attempting to overthrow the government by force” in connection with the Gezi Park anti-government protests in 2013. Osman Kavala, 64, has been held since October 2017 on accusations of financing the protests which began as small demonstrations in an Istanbul park and snowballed into nationwide anti-government unrest. The court also handed out 18-year sentences to seven activists accused of assisting Kavala, ordering the immediate arrest of Mücella Yapıcı, Çiğdem Mater, Hakan Altınay, Mine Özerden, Can Atalay, Yiğit Ali Ekmekçi and Tayfun Kahraman. The courtroom, packed and overheated with fearful and exhausted observers, reportedly erupted with protest chants including “long live freedom, down with tyranny” on hearing the verdict. “We will not bow to persecution,” yelled Atalay on hearing his sentence. The sentencing marks Turkish authorities’ deepest and most public crackdown on dissent and freedom of assembly in the past decade and threatens to damage Turkish relations with Europe after heavy criticism of the marathon trial. Amnesty International called the decision “a travesty of justice”, calling the trial “a politically motivated charade”. “It’s a horrifying decision, and not one that was in any way expected,” said Emma Sinclair-Webb, Turkey director of Human Rights Watch, speaking from outside the courtroom. “This entire process from start to finish has been a show trial.” The draconian sentences, which defendants and observers claim was based on flimsy evidence, follow criticisms that the trial has been subject to political interference. “It’s completely in defiance of Turkey’s obligations to international law,” said Webb. “This case is emblematic, it’s exposed the human rights in the country as being in complete crisis – it shows that the presidency can do what it wants to people. It’s an act of utter defiance against the international order as well.” Kavala appeared in court via video link from Silivri high security prison on the outskirts of Istanbul. “I consider peaceful protests aiming to prevent government initiatives that are not in public interest as legitimate civil society activities and a requirement of democracy,” he said. “After losing four and a half years of my life, the only aspect I can find solace in is the possibility that what I experienced could contribute to confronting the crucial problems in the judiciary of Turkey, and so those tried in future could receive better treatment.” Small protests against an urban development plan in Istanbul’s Gezi Park that began in 2013 quickly transformed into huge anti-government protests. A fierce response by the authorities was followed by years-long attacks on anyone accused of aiding or organising the protest movement. Kavala was accused of financing the protests after he paid for a folding table and some snacks for protesters, and arrested in the Istanbul airport in 2017. He was later acquitted of all charges in 2020, but quickly rearrested before he could return home. He was later charged with espionage, and alleged involvement in a 2016 attempted coup. Kavala has frequently been singled out for criticism by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who accuses the Paris-born philanthropist of connections to the Hungarian-American investor George Soros. Last October, Turkey declared 10 western ambassadors, including those from the US, Germany and France, “persona non grata”, after they issued a statement condemning Kavala’s continued detention, before later reversing the decision. The trial was repeatedly condemned as unjust and politically motivated by rights groups as well as the Council of Europe, whose ministers took the highly unusual decision earlier this year to formally begin the process of accusing Turkey of infringement, after Turkish authorities refused to release Kavala after a ruling by the European court of human rights. “It is regrettable that the Turkish authorities have refused to execute the respective ECHR’s ruling. Such attitude sets a worrying precedent and further increases the EU’s concerns regarding Turkish judiciary’s adherence to international and European standards,” they said. Kavala, Yapıcı and their co-defendants remained defiant in court throughout the sentencing, and are expected to appeal. “It is evident that those who issued the indictment did not feel constrained by laws, considering that they will receive political support as they intended to prolong my detention at all costs,” said Kavala.",News/World news,Philanthropist sentenced to life in Turkey in ‘travesty’ trial over Gezi Park protests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/philanthropist-sentenced-to-life-in-turkey-in-travesty-trial-over-gezi-park-protests

In a statement to MPs, Ben Wallace said gifts of weapons by Britain could eventually total £500m, and he said 15,000 Russian soldiers had died since the invasion began on 24 February. “We have gifted in aid £200m which we propose will grow to £500m to Ukraine,” Wallace told the House of Commons. Replacement equipment would be paid for by the Treasury on an “old for new” basis, the minister said. The objective of British military support should be to help ensure Ukraine “gets to chose where it wishes to settle for peace”, Wallace said, but he added that in his view Russia should be forced out of the entire country, back to its pre-2014 border. “I want Putin not only beyond the pre-February boundaries. He invaded Crimea illegally, he invaded Donetsk illegally and he should comply with international law and in the long run leave Ukraine,” Wallace said. On Monday night it was also announced that the UK would send 22 new ambulances to Ukraine and had already sent more than 40 fire engines. Britain is also one of the largest suppliers in Europe of arms to Ukraine, running down its stocks of weapons to keep Kyiv’s forces supplied. But its supplies are dwarfed by those of the US, which has provided $3.7bn of military aid since Russia invaded. Stormer armoured vehicles carry Starstreak laser-guided anti-aircraft missiles and are designed to provide a roving threat to Russian jets and helicopters. On the tanks, Wallace’s language suggested a firming up of plans first floated by Boris Johnson on Friday when he said the UK was “looking at” sending British Challenger 2s to Poland so that Warsaw could in turn send Ukraine more T-72 tanks, the Russian design used by its armed forces. Wallace told MPs: “We’re also offering a deployment of British Challenger tanks to Poland to bridge the gap between Poland donating tanks to Ukraine and their replacement arriving from a third country.” Poland expects to receive the first of 250 US-made Abrams tanks later this year but is willing to send more of its arsenal of T-72s to Ukraine if the UK and other western nations come forward and provide reinforcements now. Earlier this month it was suggested that Poland could donate 100 T-72s to its neighbour, and there have been some reports suggesting some of the Soviet-designed vehicles have already secretly been sent. Wallace indicated that the UK was looking at supplying Brimstone ground-based missiles that could be used to defend Odesa against any seaborne invasion, but he ruled out giving Kyiv the UK’s dated AS90 artillery. Since the beginning of the year the UK has supplied 5,361 NLAW anti-tank bazookas, more than 200 US-made Javelin missiles and 104 Starstreak high-velocity and other low-velocity anti-tank weapons, Wallace said.",News/Politics,"UK military aid to Ukraine could rise to £500m, MPs told",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/uk-military-aid-to-ukraine-could-rise-to-500m-mps-told
4/26/2022,"Laurena Henschke had been dead about 12 months when a letter from the Australian government turned up at her Adelaide home. “Dear Mrs Henschke,” it read. “You have moved up in the queue and I expect that you will be assigned a home care package in about three months. This package may be lower than the level you are approved for, but it lets you start to receive some home care services.” The letter was a cruel frustration for her husband and carer, Dr Philip Henschke, who had sought, and been approved for, the highest level of home care for Laurena 18 months earlier. “Laurena had two years of relentless decline with what they call a glioblastoma multiforme, which is the A-grade nasty, can’t-beat-it brain tumour,” he told the Guardian. “Life got rough in the last six to nine months.” Henschke and his daughters worked together to care for her. But the demands became significantly more difficult in Laurena’s final stages. Laurena’s balance required two people, one on each side, to get her on to a shower chair or on and off the toilet. “You’ve got to have round-the-clock staffing, alarms, bed rails and all that sort of thing to cope. But we got by, we bought an electric bed and slept in the room with her, and we saw her into the next life, or off the planet, at home, which was a great blessing.” The letter felt like a parting shot from a system the aged care royal commission would later describe as “unacceptably” delayed. “What frustrated me was that having gone through probate, reporting her death through the state health authorities, cancelling her bank and superannuation accounts, it was quite clear that there was no intersection between them,” Henschke said. Four years have passed since his ordeal. But, with aged care firming as a key battleground before the election, has much changed in home care since? Has access to home care – critical in managing Australia’s ageing population and relieving the strain on residential care – improved since the royal commission last year told the government to act “urgently” to fix waiting lists? Data suggests the kinds of waits Laurena and Philip Henschke faced are still significant, though improving. After the royal commission, the Coalition announced 80,000 new home care packages worth more than $7bn, which are being delivered progressively until 2023. About 30,000 packages have been released so far. Government data shows the time people spend on the waiting list – the time between approval and the availability of care – is coming down gradually. The wait times for the kinds of packages Laurena Henschke was approved for has reduced to an average of six to nine months, down from 12 months or more in 2020. But at the same time the sector has warned of a glaring problem, compromising its ability to deliver support services, even if they have been approved and funded by government. It’s one faced right across aged care: staffing. Earlier this month, the biggest home care provider in the country, myHomecare Group, sounded the alarm, with its chief executive Stuart Miller telling the Guardian its staff were at “breaking point”. Miller estimated his staff turnover was somewhere near 30% in a single year – far better than the sector average, but still an extraordinary and disruptive rate. “The staff turnover in this industry has been nothing short of abysmal,” he said. “We’ve really found that a lot of the workers are leaving earlier certainly than they wanted and finishing their careers full stop just due to the stress of the last two years.” Staffing problems, he said, meant less critical forms of support were being delayed or compromised. “When you’ve got this level of turnover, it really upsets everything, from the clients to the economics of the business itself. It’s been a real struggle for us in the last two years.” Industry peak group, Aged and Community Services Australia, delivered a similar warning. It said the sector had faced “serious workforce shortages and low wages” prior to the pandemic. The pressures of the last two years had made it ever more difficult. “Attracting home care and other aged care workers has become even more difficult through the pressures of the past two years,” Acsa’s chief executive, Paul Sadler, said. It’s an issue that was flagged in no uncertain terms by the royal commission. In its final report last year, the royal commission said it was “not confident that there is adequate capacity to supply all the services that should be funded under a needs-based system”. “It will be necessary for supply-side capacity to be assessed and, where necessary, grown, so that aged care services are available when and where they are needed,” its report said. “This requires detailed planning.” The planning, the royal commission said, would need to ensure “an adequate coverage of services to meet the population needs for major cities, rural, regional, and remote Australia”, as well as ensuring “the capacity and capability of new and existing providers to deliver more aged care services”. The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said last week that the home care workforce had grown by 15,000 in the past five months, which would constitute an almost 15% surge in the workforce. The figures – drawn from data only available to the minister, according to his office – are at odds with the experience of industry. Sean Rooney, chief executive of Leading Age Services Australia, an aged care sector peak group, said he had seen no figures reflecting such a significant boost to the home care workforce. “Providers report to LASA that they continue to face severe staffing challenges due to the pandemic, so it is difficult to see where these workers are coming from,” Rooney told the Guardian. Ahead of the this year’s budget, National Seniors Australia warned the government about precisely this point. The home care packages were welcome, the group said in its budget submission. But they were not enough without an adequate workforce to deliver them. It also provided several practical steps the government could take to unlock a new home care workforce, easily mobilised and often ready to work. Home care is typically provided through a combination of informal support, provided by family, and paid care workers. Yet the current pension arrangements effectively punish pensioners who want to take up caring work for family or loved ones. National Seniors said the “punitive, penny -inching pension system” punished people for working additional hours. It is advocating for exempting employment income from the age pension income test for low-wealth pensioners working in aged and healthcare. The group’s chief advocate, Ian Henschke, said the system was denying the sector a significant pool of workers for no good reason. “You’ve got people who work in aged care and home care who want to work more, who won’t work more because they get penalised 50 cents in the dollar,” Henschke said. “Why would anyone who is over 66.5 on a pension continue to work in aged care or home care? Yet they’re the very people who are often the most sympathetic to the older person, because they are about the age of the person’s daughter or son.” The government has provided $338.5m to expand, train and upskill the aged care workforce. The issue is personal for Henschke. Philip Henscke is his brother and Laurena was his sister-in-law. The number of people dying while waiting for their approved home care package has reduced in recent years. More than 50,000 older Australians have died since 2017-18. In the last six months of 2021, 3,802 people on the NPS died before receiving the home care package they had been approved for. More than 8,000 died in the 2020-21 financial year, and 10,563 died in 2019-20. Labor’s Mark Butler described the figures as a “national disgrace” and a sign the system was still in crisis, despite the reduction. “Most Australians want to age in their own home but the system that’s supposed to help them do that is in crisis,” he said. “There are still tens of thousands of older Australians waiting for Home Care Packages.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The opposition has sought to make aged care a central plank of its re-election pitch. But the policies it has announced so far largely focus on residential care. Colbeck says the opposition has “offered nothing on home care”. “While Labor has offered nothing on home care – the Morrison Government is investing in aged care workforce initiatives that attract and retain a diverse range of workers with the right skills, knowledge and attributes to work and pursue a career in aged care,” a spokesperson said. “Initiatives include place-based approaches targeting local workers and national projects.” For Philip Henschke, the idea of encouraging pensioners into home care work is a good one. He had a “fantastic” care worker who was a pensioner, but told him he would be unable to work more than one day a week. “[Fixing that] would be a great help to fill the gap because we’re not going to get there,” he said. “We haven’t got the nurses, and what we really do need are these home care attendants.”",News/Australia news,"Too little, too late: who will fix the home care crisis for Australia’s ageing population?

4/26/2022,"The Queensland police service appears to have balked at substantial reform to the way it handles officers who are accused of domestic violence, after promising to act on a “concerning increase” in the volume of complaints. Last May the assistant commissioner Brian Codd told Guardian Australia that police were “grappling” with how to respond to the increase officer-involved domestic violence, and that reforms were “very much” on the agenda. “You can be a truck driver and you can be subject to a domestic and family violence order and it may not have any impact on your employment or where you sit within society … but we expect and are entitled to more from police officers,” Codd said last year. He said at the time he had met with the Queensland police ethical standards command “to work out a position we might need to take on this”. Asked last week what progress had been made in Queensland, a police spokesperson pointed to changes to the operational procedures manual in July 2021 to “support greater officer accountability and ensure the confidence of the public is maintained while an investigation takes place”. A comparison with the previous operational procedures manual shows the relevant section was updated to require additional paperwork by officers, including ensuring that the “actioning district” submits a briefing note to police ethical standards command for consideration of disciplinary action. “Immediate consideration of the officer’s circumstances, current position, and the level of contact that member may have with members of the public is reviewed on a case-by-case basis,” the police spokesperson said. Officer-involved domestic violence poses a significant problem to authorities; specifically allowing natural justice to a person accused of an offence, or subject to a domestic violence order. At the same time, women’s advocates say it is problematic that a domestic violence victim seeking assistance could theoretically encounter an officer who is subject to a complaint, charge or conviction. Domestic violence now makes up about 40% of calls for police assistance. Victoria has attempted to address the issue by establishing a specialist police unit to investigate complaints against officers. Angela Lynch, a domestic violence protection advocate, said changes to operational procedures in Queensland did not go far enough, and victims needed “confidence their case will be dealt with appropriately”. Lynch said officer-involved domestic violence would be under-reported, and Queensland should have some mechanism where complaints against officers could be made and assessed independent of police. “The community needs confidence that police acknowledge that this is a problem, and that there’s some level of independent oversight,” she said. “There has to be some oversight of the decision-making process. I don’t think the community in the end does have confidence that police can do this themselves. It’s Caesar judging Caesar.” Guardian Australia reported in 2020 that 84 serving police officers had been accused of domestic violence in the previous five years. Police say this rate is “lower than the general public” but evidence suggests officers are “as likely as anyone else” to perpetrate domestic violence. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “On occasion QPS members are subject of domestic and family violence complaint reporting,” a police spokesperson said. “While these particular matters may be lower than the rate of the general public, any report of members suspected of perpetrating domestic and family violence is taken extremely seriously. “Responding to incidents of domestic and family violence is often challenging and complex. “The Queensland police service remains committed to refining and enhancing the police response to DFV, including improving processes for reporting and investigating matters in a timely manner, taking protective action tailored to the needs of the victim and holding perpetrators to account.”",News/Australia news,Queensland police update manual after signalling reforms to how officers accused of domestic violence are handled,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/queensland-police-update-procedures-after-promising-to-act-on-officers-accused-of-domestic-violence
4/26/2022,"I’m tempted to start this column by writing: a well-made garment can be elusive, but we all know it when we see it. Unfortunately, I think saying so is about as helpful as the advice, “you do you”. The reality is, the quality of our clothes has been in steady decline since the late 1990s, when fast fashion caused production and consumption to rise and prices to plummet. Despite this, well-made garments do exist, if you know what you’re looking for. Here, in the first of a two-part series, experts explain how to tell if a garment has been made with care and skill before you take it into the fitting room. The owner of vintage consignment store Shop Bruce, Dan Neilsenbeck, says: “The best way to assess the quality of a garment’s construction is to look inside.” When you do this, the first thing you should be checking is if the hem and seams are thoroughly sewn down. According to Max Sanderson, a lecturer in fashion design at Parson’s Paris, a loose hem is easy to snag with a thumb or big toe. Next, Sanderson says to examine the stitching. He looks for small stitches because they’re more durable than long ones which are a giveaway that a garment has been made quickly. Finally, he inspects the whole thing for flaws to be sure there are no threads coming undone or obvious signs it has been damaged or pulled. The tags inside the garment will tell you where the garment was made, what its fabric composition is and how to care for it – key things when deciding if something is going to suit your needs. For instance, if you are looking for something to wear on a day-to-day basis, you likely want to steer clear of garments labelled hand wash or dry clean only. Similarly, the fabric composition tells you how the garment will wear. Anything made of a protein fibre like wool will keep you warm when it’s cold but will also breathe if you get hot. It also has a waxy coating, so it doesn’t need to be washed frequently and is resistant to wrinkles, so it is good for travelling. Fibres made from plant matter like cotton, linen or viscose rayon are breathable but won’t keep you as warm. They are easy to wash making them great to wear close to the body, but crease easily. Synthetic fibres like polyester or nylon are trickier. They don’t breathe and trap body odour so if you are wearing them against your skin, you may notice they cause you to sweat and smell. But Sanderson says synthetics can be necessary for performance requirements like waterproof or windproof jackets and athletic wear. According to Neilsenbeck: “High quality fabric will feel better on your skin and generally fit, drape and wear better.” To judge the quality of a garment’s fabric, you need to get a sense of the fabric’s hand, or how it feels. To test this, designer Bianca Spender pulls the fabric between her thumbs to see if it stretches or holds its form then she will gently rub it to see if it pills. Sanderson recommends rubbing the fabric against a part of your body that’s more sensitive than the palm of your hand, like the side of your neck or forearm, where the skin is more delicate. While it may have been true 20 years ago that a made in Italy tag indicated a superior level of craftsmanship and quality, that’s not necessarily the case now. Knowledge and expertise vary widely across factories and within countries, and some of the most advanced technology and skilled workforces are in China and other parts of the global south. But there are some other things to consider based on where something is made, like environmental protections and labour laws. Spender says: “You should always be asking yourself the question does the price of the clothing reflect the work that goes into it.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning A more technical way of judging the care and attention that went into making something are the seams. Spender says she “will always check to see if the seams are bubbling and whether the side seam is hanging straight, to check the fabric isn’t off grain”. If a garment is made of a patterned fabric, Neilsenbeck says to make sure the patterns are matched along the seams. The finish of a seam on the inside of a garment can tell you a lot about the time and care that went into making it. A good rule of thumb is that there should be no raw edges. One way of covering raw edges is to overlock the seam. Overlocking is a type of stitch that goes right to the edge of the cloth and runs in tight, zigzag lines from the edge to about half a centimetre in. According to Sanderson, an overlocked seam is the fastest way to make a garment and can be more fragile. But in certain things like jersey T-shirts or jumpers, this isn’t necessarily a problem. “It’s all about the right finishes for the right materials,” Spender says. Generally speaking, better quality garments will have bound seams, so that the raw edge of the fabric is covered. Or flat-felled seams where there are no exposed edges, so the fabric has been folded twice and stitched along both sides. A French seam is similar to this but is less visible and usually used for high end, sheer garments.

4/26/2022,"Australian voters who chose their preferred candidate before the election was called have saved time. The campaign’s policy vacuum has hardly informed voting choices, with both major parties eschewing what the former US president George Bush Sr termed the “vision thing”. Whether or not politicians, irrespective of ideological colour, have the stomach for them, important and urgent economic challenges lie ahead. Household living standards are threatened by rising costs, low wage growth, poor quality of jobs, employment insecurity, higher mortgage repayments and housing unaffordability. Downgrades in 2022 global growth from 4.4% to 3.6% and China’s slowdown, along with its reduced emphasis on infrastructure spending, diversification of commodity suppliers and the antagonistic Sino-Australian relationship, pose risks to an uneven post-pandemic recovery. With China being the world’s factory, its Covid-19 policy may continue to disrupt supply for some time. Longer term, the pandemic and geopolitical realignments may reshape the global economic order. Australia, an open economy dependent on trade and the free flow of capital, is exposed. Rising costs of providing retirement incomes, aged care, and health and disability services will need to be met. With climate change accelerating, even modest restrictions on carbon emissions will impact Australia’s fossil fuel exports. Adaptation to regular extreme weather events and resource scarcity will be expensive. Increases in public and private debt have reduced flexibility to deal with these issues. Major changes in the economic structure are needed. This requires cogent policies for managing volatile commodity incomes, demographics, the labour market, workforce and skills planning, productivity, and regulatory and tax frameworks. Welfare systems need to be redesigned to ensure they assist the disadvantaged. Yet instead of addressing these issues, the 2022 election campaign has deployed familiar tropes. Both major parties have thrown fistfuls of dollars aimed at effectively buying votes. The cost-benefit analysis of many initiatives is dubious. While individually small, a few millions here and there soon add up to serious money. Both sides favour impressive announcements which they cannot or will not implement. During the pandemic and natural disasters, many government programs were difficult to access. Intentional complexity and a lack of resources allocated to processing applications means assistance frequently goes unused. Improvements in the federal budget result from money allocated for programs but not spent. The proclamation of a headline-grabbing scheme substitutes for taking the necessary action. Population growth to underpin economic activity and high property prices is popular with the two-thirds of the population who own real estate. This ignores resource constraints and limits on available land, which is protected from the effects of climate change. Initiatives, especially on defence, run into tens of billions. Voters are meant to be impressed by the sums, incomprehensible to most, even if the project’s merits are unclear. Credit is claimed for positives, irrespective of the claimant’s contribution. Australia’s recovery is driven by factors outside policymakers’ influence – for example, Chinese iron ore and coal demand, high commodity prices and supply disruptions elsewhere. The only direct input has been substantial government spending of other people’s money. Simultaneously, external factors such as the Ukraine conflict – outside Australian control – are blamed for negatives that include rising fuel, energy, food and housing costs. Numbers are manipulated to present favourable outcomes. Budget forecasts have repeatedly underestimated revenues, overestimated outgoings and understated commodity prices to make the actual outcome better and demonstrate competence. For hard issues, inquiries or royal commissions are proposed even though the problems and solutions are already known. If all else fails there is the the belief that something, probably new technology, will turn up, because it always has. Donald Horne’s phrase “the lucky country” is resurrected, ignoring its irony and criticism of a nation lacking imagination and mired in philistinism, provincialism, complacency and its past. While grist for comedians, this policy drift has consequences. Problems become larger and solutions more costly, or they have reduced effectiveness. Future generations are left to deal with the mess. The process encourages societal “cakeism”: keeping your confectionery and eating it. It promotes unrealistic expectations that there are no costs to choices and everyone can have everything when they desire it merely because they demand it. A “looting” mentality sets in. Voters auction their allegiances to the highest bidder under a “what’s-in-it-for-me?” ethos, ignoring the wider costs. Elections should be serious undertakings, when alternative plans and visions on important issues are presented and debated. The 2022 election campaign has, to date, fallen well short of this standard. This exacerbates a lack of voter engagement, a fragmented political process and, ultimately, a loss of trust in democracy itself.
