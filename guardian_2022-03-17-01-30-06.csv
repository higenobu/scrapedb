3/17/2022,"The prima ballerina Olga Smirnova, one of Russia’s biggest dance stars, has quit the Bolshoi Ballet company in Moscow after denouncing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It was announced on Wednesday that Smirnova, who was born and raised in St Petersburg, has now joined the Dutch National Ballet, where she will start immediately alongside the Brazilian soloist Victor Caixeta, who has left the Mariinsky Ballet in St Petersburg in response to the war. In a statement, Dutch National Ballet said that the invasion had made it untenable for Smirnova to continue to work in Russia. Earlier this month, she posted an emotional message on the social media app Telegram saying that she was against the war “with all the fibres of my soul”. The dancer, who has a Ukrainian grandfather, said “we can not remain indifferent to this global catastrophe” and that she expected political matters to be resolved only through peaceful negotiations. “I never thought I would be ashamed of Russia, I have always been proud of talented Russian people, of our cultural and athletic achievements,” she added. “But now I feel that a line has been drawn that separates the before and the after.” Smirnova, who became a prima ballerina at the Bolshoi in 2016, is the first Russian to quit the lauded company over the war. She said that she had been considering a move before Russia’s invasion but that “the current circumstances accelerated this process”. Ted Brandsen, director of Dutch National Ballet, said Smirnova was an exceptional dancer, that he had followed her career for many years and that it would be a privilege to have her in the company, albeit in such “incredibly sad” circumstances. Her first role with the company will be as the eponymous heroine of Marius Petipa’s Raymonda, which opens in Amsterdam on 3 April. She will be joined in Raymonda by Caixeta, who said: “The current circumstances have meant I’ve had to make the hard decision of leaving Russia – the place I’ve called home for almost five years”.",Arts/Stage,‘A line has been drawn’: Olga Smirnova quits Bolshoi Ballet over Ukraine war ,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/16/a-line-has-been-drawn-olga-smirnova-quits-bolshoi-ballet-over-ukraine-war
3/17/2022,"President Putin’s merciless invasion of Ukraine gravely violates international law and UN conventions. Ukrainians are showing massive bravery but Russia has such crushing firepower and utter ruthlessness that we can expect more of Putin’s military objectives to be taken in the weeks ahead. Whatever short-term gains he secures, we must make sure that Putin fails in the longer run through Ukrainian resistance, tougher sanctions, more humanitarian help, wider international isolation, justice for the war crimes being committed and, above all, lasting western unity in confronting Russia’s aggression. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, rightly declared that the invasion of Ukraine “marks a watershed in the history of our continent”. We’re now entering a new era in European security. During a 30-minute speech to the Bundestag, he shifted decades-old German defence policy and doubled the defence budget with a €100bn boost this year. Denmark has announced the “largest investment in recent decades” to match Nato targets in response to Russia’s aggression. The Netherlands has done the same. All democracies must respond to the newly realised threats to national and European security. Labour in government did exactly this. In 2004, we introduced the longest sustained real-terms increase in spending for two decades and expanded the defence budget by £3.5bn a year. When speaking about 9/11, our then chancellor, Gordon Brown, said: “Recent events demand that we strengthen not just our national security, but our national resilience, our capacity to respond.” We also modernised military equipment and maintained the size of the army throughout our 13 years in government. But how well – not just how much – a government spends on defence matters. The Ministry of Defence is a uniquely failing department. It is failing British troops and British taxpayers. None of its 36 major projects, totalling £166bn, are rated “green” for being on time and within budget. It has wasted at least £13bn in the last decade through mismanagement and misjudgment and the Public Accounts Committee’s 2021 procurement review concluded: “The department’s system for delivering major equipment capabilities is broken.” As our first steps in dealing with these deep-seated problems, Labour in government would commission the National Audit Office to do an across-the-board audit of MoD waste and make the MoD the first department subject to our new Office for Value for Money’s tough regime on spending decisions. Exactly one year ago today, the government published its strategy for “Global Britain” with its integrated review. The prime minister trumpeted a “tilt” to the Indo-Pacific and the review overlooked the European Union. It was billed as a “threat-led” strategy but failed to mention any Taliban takeover in Afghanistan or invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, ministers also published plans to cut the strength of the British army by a further 10,000 soldiers. Before the integrated review was published, I outlined Labour’s principles for national security, arguing defence planning had to focus on where the threats lay, not where the business opportunities might be. I argued that the biggest threat to stability for Europe was coming from Russia, and that Labour would give the highest priority to security in Europe, the North Atlantic and the Arctic to reflect our unshakeable commitment to Nato. We will be dealing with the consequences of this invasion for years, with more danger and complexity to our national security than at any time since the cold war. That’s why I’m asking ministers to urgently revisit the integrated review and the current defence settlement, reform military procurement and rethink army cuts. If the Conservatives now step up to the seriousness of the moment and review our defence spending as Labour did after 9/11, they will have our full support.

3/17/2022,"Microplastics from European rivers are finding their way to Arctic seas, research suggests. These tiny plastic particles, which come from clothing fibres, car tyres, cosmetics and many more sources, have been found across the entire planet, from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. People are known to consume the tiny particles via food and water, as well as breathing them in. Microplastics have been shown to harm wildlife but the impact on people is not known, though microplastics do damage human cells in the laboratory. They have also been found in the Arctic, and until now the source of these tiny particles has not been known. A new study in Scientific Reports, led by Mats Huserbråten from the Institute of Marine Research, in Bergen, Norway, suggests particles in the Arctic Ocean, the Nordic Seas and Baffin Bay have spread from Europe. The scientists used modelling to predict how many microplastic particles would be in certain parts of the ocean, and compared it with water samples from these places. Their analysis suggests microplastics have been circulating in the Arctic for at least a decade. To work it out, they combined models of ocean currents between 2007 and 2017 with simulations of floating microplastic movements. Then, they simulated the release of microplastics from 21 major rivers across northern Europe and the Arctic every day over a 10-year period and modelled their movements over decades. After this, they simulated the release of microplastics from 21 major rivers across northern Europe and the Arctic every day over a 10-year period and modelled their movements over decades, then compared the results of their model with the distribution of floating microplastics across 121 seawater samples that were collected from 17 sites off the west coast of Norway between May 2017 and August 2018. They found that most simulated particles drifted along two main pathways after being released from rivers, with 65% drifting along the Norwegian coast towards the Laptev Sea, north of Russia, before going to the Arctic Ocean, across the north pole, then exiting the Arctic Ocean via the Fram Strait east of Greenland. Thirty per cent went in another direction, travelling across Greenland then farther south along the north-east coast of Canada. Analysis of seawater found in each of these areas revealed the distribution of these floating microplastics was consistent with what was predicted by the models. The researchers warned that better waste management is required so the health of the Arctic ecosystem is not compromised. They said: “The equal distribution of sampled synthetic particles across water masses covering a wide time frame of anthropogenic influence suggests a system in full saturation rather than pronounced injection from European sources, through a complex circulation scheme connecting the entire Arctic Mediterranean. “This circulation of microplastic through Arctic ecosystems may have large consequences to natural ecosystem health, highlighting an ever-increasing need for better waste management.” Current methods to reduce microplastic release include adding filters to washing machines to catch particles. They can also be removed by some wastewater and drinking water treatments.",News/Environment,"Microplastics from European rivers spreading to Arctic seas, research shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/16/microplastics-from-european-rivers-spreading-to-arctic-seas-research-shows
3/17/2022,"The Russian billionaire Alexei Mordashov may have avoided a freeze on a £1bn shareholding in Tui, the world’s biggest tourism company, after selling most of his 34% stake to a British Virgin Islands company. Russia’s richest man had become the single largest shareholder in Tui, which has dual stock market listings in Frankfurt and London, after stepping in to keep it afloat during the pandemic. He resigned from the Tui board on 2 March, two days after being blacklisted by the EU. The UK government imposed sanctions on him on Tuesday. Mordashov was among the first oligarchstargeted, with the EU citing his investments in Rossiya bank, described as the “personal bank” of Russia’s senior officials, and his stakes in television stations that had played a role in destabilising Ukraine through pro-Russia broadcasts. Last Friday Tui announced in a regulatory filing and press release that Mordashov had sold 29.9% of his Tui shareholding to Ondero Ltd, based in the British Virgin Islands. The shares are worth £1.1bn at today’s prices. Tui said the remaining 4.1% had been sold to the businessman’s Russian investment vehicle, Severgroup. Tui said the transfers had been made four days earlier, on 28 February – the day Modashov was named on the EU sanctions list. Under sanctions rules, Mordashov’s entire holding in Tui would have been frozen, which would have meant he could not sell his shares, collect dividends, vote at board meetings or profit from the stake in any other way. However, Tui has confirmed that only the small portion held by Severgroup, worth £155m, was frozen. The firm said it did not know who the owners of Ondero were, or whether its 29.9% stake had been frozen under the sanctions regime. A Tui spokesperson said: “We cannot judge whether and how the sanctions apply here. Tui would only have to be notified if there is a controlling shareholder [at Ondero]. Reporting obligations under capital market law in Germany apply to all shareholders of a company, no matter where they are based. As Tui and the German financial regulator BaFin did not receive any additional voting rights notification, the company cannot pursue this or identify the shareholders of Ondero.” Bloomberg reported last week that the Ondero stake remained “affiliated” with Mordashov. The information about its true owner is hidden by British Virgin Islands secrecy rules. The UK overseas territory and former colony has resisted calls to make its company register public, which means information about shareholders can only be obtained in exceptional circumstances, such as a request by law enforcement. Mordashov transferred another valuable asset on 28 February, handing a $1.1bn shareholding in the Russian mining group Nordgold to his wife, Marina Mordashova. The businessman, who is the chief executive of Severstal, Russia’s biggest steel and mining group, also chairs its parent company, Severgroup, a private investment company, which has interests ranging from telecoms to gold mining, media and engineering. A spokesperson for Severstal said the company could not comment on the Ondero deal. She added: “I just want to remind you that Mr Mordashov was included in EU sanctions list before [on 28 February]. So, nothing really changes for Tui with the UK sanctions being imposed on Mr Mordashov. I can also confirm that he doesn’t have any assets in the UK.” Mordashov pushed back against the EU’s decision to blacklist him, saying a day later: “For a very long time, I have been engaged in the development of economic, cultural and humanitarian cooperation with many European countries and I fail to understand how these sanctions against me will contribute to the settlement of the dreadful conflict in Ukraine.”",News/Business,"Alexei Mordashov, Russia’s richest man, may have avoided freeze on £1bn Tui shares",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/16/alexei-mordashov-russia-richest-man-may-have-avoided-freeze-on-1bn-tui-shares
3/17/2022,"Ira Lupu had been planning a photography show about Ukraine for a while but on 24 February, when Russian tanks arrived and missiles started to rain down on her homeland, things pivoted horribly. “We had two weeks to get it ready,” says the New York-based photographer. “And no budget – we’re not the Guggenheim.” But help was at hand. Picto New York printed all the works for free, while the Magnum Foundation provided sponsorship. Digital photographs, normally easy to source, could be a problem, though: photojournalist Maxim Dondyuk “is in a field, literally running around with a helmet in a war zone in a precarious situation”, explains Lupu. “Some of the works we requested from him were on a hard drive he won’t get to any time soon.” The exhibition, called In Ukraine and showing in a Brooklyn gallery, features the work of photographers and documentarians from the country, as well as outsiders with a connection, the intention being to provide an understanding of its culture that isn’t simply a reflexive reaction to war. Lupu had felt exasperated by how little westerners knew about her homeland. “Given Ukraine’s importance in foreign policy,” she says, “I felt it would benefit Americans to know it better.” She, and co-curator Fred Richtin, are already planning similar exhibitions around the world. “This war is bringing back the trauma of leaving, refugee-style, with one suitcase,” says Yelena Yemchuk, of her flight from Kyiv at the age of 11. Although she resides in New York, “the majority of my work has come from Ukraine. I developed my language as an artist there.” Her stark black-and-white shots feature kids on a trampoline and lovers in the park. Five years ago, Yemchuk published Gidropark, about the recreational space she frequented as a child. She is now finishing a book about the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea and the fighting in Donetsk. “The spirit of the people is blossoming in an incredible, powerful way,” she says. “The last words of every text I get, every daily conversation, are: ‘We will prevail.’” For photographer Elena Subach, who is in western Ukraine near the border with EU countries, prevailing still seems far off: this relatively quiet area has recently been disrupted by explosions. A volunteer since the third day of the war, Subach helps women, children and the elderly cross from Ukraine into Slovakia. Waves of new refugees keep arriving. This checkpoint is the last stop before families are splintered; she is often witness to wrenching goodbyes. “I have never seen so much love, as I have never seen so much pain,” she tells me, via email. “I could hardly photograph people myself, as I could not dare to interfere in their already fragile and ruined private space. But I understood the importance of the moment.” She has managed to photograph still lifes: objects left behind among chairs where people stopped to rest before pressing forward. “I don’t know what art will be like after the war,” she says. The show also features images from Subach’s series Grandmothers on the Edge of Heaven, which Lupu calls “visually fun and upbeat, with bold colours and interesting compositions”. It spotlights the endearing figure of the babushka – or babusya in Ukraine. The grandmothers, wizened with time and conflict, have endured the second world war and Soviet takeovers. Subach’s photographs capture the grit they showed to survive. Despite Subach’s bright palette, her series is “also an entry point to sad conversations”. Her own grandmother, too weak to flee, is stuck in Odesa, believed to be Putin’s next target. Daria Svertilova had no notion that her series Temporary Homes, started in 2019, would become quite so current. The exhibition includes some of her images of student dorms, which are the only form of social housing in Ukraine. After the annexation of Crimea in 2014, she felt westerners spoke about Ukrainians reductively: “Through the prism of techno or war – it was always those two things.” While studying in France, she returned intermittently to her homeland, concentrating on portraying Ukrainian youth. “The buildings and the living conditions are still really Soviet, but there’s a new generation of pro-European Ukrainians who’re not at all nostalgic about the past. Those born after 2000 see the country moving towards globalisation.” Svertilova was back in Ukraine working on the project in January. On 5 February, she left a peaceful country that has since vanished. “We can’t speak about the war all the time,” Svertilova says. “And art is a nice way to speak about peace.” But it’s easier said than done. “When I look at my pictures,” she adds, “I can’t see them with the same eyes now. I just hope all of these people are safe. I hope the guys weren’t sent to war. I hope the girls aren’t in cities that were bombed.” She adds: “After the war started, I’d walk in the street and just start to cry. A couple of days ago, I heard a baby crying, and the first thing that came to mind was pictures of dead children. I’m in France, but part of me is in Ukraine.” Lupu shares this feeling of “being so stressed while physically safe – traumatised and always on the verge of some breakdown”. It makes productivity impossible: “You just don’t leave bed the whole day. You can’t even wash your face or do the work that brings you money.” As a result it helped to rally foreign artists who are invested in Ukraine but not as paralysed. Chiara Negrello focuses on Italy’s Ukrainian community of professional caregivers. “We even have a Russian artist in the exhibition,” says Lupu. This is Alexey Yurenev, who has been living in New York for years and contributed a project about Odesa. “I know his heart is aching for his country and the zombified Russians supporting this invasion. It’s a completely different sort of hell. He is crying and grieving with us – we are allies. It’s terrible to be a good Russian these days.” Ultimately, is there hope – or just dread? “I don’t have any doubt that Ukraine will win,” says Svertilova. “Because of the spirit of people. The resistance is really strong. Nobody wants to be associated with Russia.” Subach adds: “This story is not just about pain. It is also about pride for Ukrainian people who have united and become a single living organism – and for the armed forces, as well as for the courage and bravery of the people who defend the country.” She ended her email with the words: “Glory to Ukraine!”  In Ukraine is at The Gallery at Dobbin Mews in Brooklyn, New York, until 8 May.",Arts/Art and design,‘Glory to Ukraine!’ – photographers from the country put on a compelling show,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/16/glory-ukraine-photographers-show-true-spirit
3/17/2022,"Arsenal haven’t been able to compete in their one-time eponymous round of Big Cup for a while now, but in their absence from top-flight European competition, PSG have done an admirable job in holding the fort at the last-16 stage. Getting regularly knocked out of the Round of PSG (né Arsenal) is one of the highest-profile gigs in football, generating the sort of publicity only badly-spent money can buy, so it’s not surprising that Manchester United fancied some time in the spotlight and a slice of the underperforming-dysfunctional-big-club pie. Move aside, Poch! Do one, Leo! If anyone can keep us entertained during extremely testing times, United know a few €50m-plus men who can! Sadly, Harry, Paul and Bruno’s brave bid to get the round rebranded in United’s honour was doomed to failure from the get-go. PSG had already marked their territory with that dirty protest in Madrid last week, and while United’s dismal exit to Atlético made it two RoPSG(nA) ejections in four seasons, coming warmly on the heels of Sevilla in 2018, that seemingly competitive 0.500 failure-rate is effectively worthless. United currently look unlikely to qualify for Big Cup at all next season, and unless they pull their fingers out quick-smart, will be tooling around in that thing Spurs got themselves dragged into. Bang goes that 50% stat, while PSG will almost certainly be consolidating their status with a fifth RoPSG(nA) loss in seven for a best-in-class 0.714 return. Come at the kings, you better not miss. Thankfully someone at United is setting their sights a wee bit higher than PSG’s tacky last-16 nomenclature. Continually purchasing square pegs for round holes isn’t the only way a big club can find itself run aground like an oligarch’s yacht, as Chelsea are finding out right now, and suddenly the future of Thomas Tuchel has become a hot topic. Tuchel is contracted until 2024, but such is the uncertainty around Stamford Bridge, he’s been forced to pledge not to quit before the end of this season. That sort of talk is more than enough to pique United’s interest, and Tuchel now reportedly tops a shortlist that also features the usual suspects plus Spain coach Luis Enrique and Julen Lopetegui of Sevilla. Land any of those three, and you’d expect United to be seriously competing for Big Cup again in two or three years. Either that or they’ll go for Brendan Rodgers, whose record in Europe would at least guarantee another concerted bid for that RoPSG(nA) title, if nothing else.

The overall quality of the Irish stayers looks slightly ahead of their British counterparts, however, and the three-mile Grade One at Leopardstown’s Christmas meeting could be the key piece of form. Flooring Porter (3.30), the defending champion, was two lengths behind Klassical Dream there but the winner stole a soft lead at the start and is unlikely to be so fortunate on Thursday.

3/17/2022,"Under the rule of Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin China and Russia have becoming increasingly isolated from the west – and closer to each other. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine came just days after Xi and Putin cemented a significant partnership on the sidelines of the Beijing Winter Olympics – the first in-person, bilateral meeting Xi had attended since the pandemic began. A joint statement from the two leaders said the bonds between the two countries had “no limits” and there were “no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation”. It called on the west to “abandon the ideologised approaches of the cold war”, and expressed support for each other’s stance on Ukraine and Taiwan. Analysts say that the leaders believe they are stronger united. “Beijing’s rationale for the China-Russia relationship is that both countries confront a hostile west and both will be better able to withstand western pressure by standing together than apart,” says Ryan Hass, a Brookings Institute scholar on China and Asia. “Without Russia, the thinking goes, China would be alone to deal with a hostile west determined to obstruct China’s rise.” “It’s worth bearing in mind that China and Russia do not have perfectly aligned interests,” says Hass. “China has a lot more to lose … than Russia. China sees itself as a country on the rise with momentum behind it. Russia is essentially fighting the tides of decline.” The timing of the partnership signed between Russia and China has raised questions about what China’s government knew of the invasion. Some analysts and US officials have suggested it was likely Beijing knew of the Russian plans for Ukraine but not the extent of them, and was caught somewhat by surprise. Beijing denies this. In the Washington Post on Wednesday, China’s ambassador to the US said any assertions it “knew about, acquiesced to or tacitly supported this war are purely disinformation”. One of the first signs that there might be limits on the partnership came on 25 February, when China abstained from voting on a UN security council resolution which would have deplored Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia used its veto power to quash the resolution but China’s decision to not actively support the veto was reportedly seen as a positive sign by western officials. Dr Courtney J Fung, an associate professor at Macquarie University and associate fellow at Chatham House, says China wants recognition as a responsible major country, but is applying this selectively when it comes to the invasion of Ukraine. “China focuses on second order issues that result from the Russian invasion – like humanitarian aid, civilian protection, evacuation – and while these are of course important concerns, China is sidestepping efforts for it to mediate or resolve the crisis itself.” China’s government and state apparatus are not referring to it as an invasion or a war, with formal directives issued to state media. It is instead usually referring to it as a “situation”, a “crisis”, or sometimes a “conflict”, and has emphasised a “complex historical background and context”. It has expressed support for both Ukraine’s sovereignty and Russia’s “security concerns”. Speaking to media after the annual “two sessions” meeting last Friday, Premier Li Keqiang said China was “deeply concerned and grieved” over the conflict. “On Ukraine, indeed the current situation there is grave,” he said. “The pressing task now is preventing tensions from escalating or even getting out of control.” Beijing has sought to present itself as neutral, and signalled it could act as a mediator, but Chinese media have amplified Russian propaganda and conspiracy theories. Government spokespeople have also promoted an anti-western narrative, blaming the US and Nato for inflaming tensions. China has struggled to navigate a path between its partnership with Russia and the huge global condemnation of the invasion. “China continues to back Russia through its comprehensive strategic partnership and to oppose Nato expansion and sanctions on Russia,” Paul Haenle, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told China File. “At the same time, it is paying lip service to its principles of non-interference and positive relations with Ukraine.” Haenle said Beijing’s aims were incompatible, but in recent days it had started to solidify its messaging into an attempt to straddle them anyway. According to reports in US media, citing unnamed government officials, Russia has requested military equipment and support from China, as well as economic assistance as global sanctions and private sector abandonment starts to bite. The initial reports didn’t detail the types of weapons Russia was seeking or China’s response, but drew warnings from the US that China would face “consequences” if it agreed. Subsequent reports, citing US diplomatic cables to allies, said Russia had requested equipment including drones, armoured vehicles and surface-to-air missiles, and that China had signalled a willingness to agree. Chinese officials angrily dismissed the claims as malicious disinformation. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said he’d never heard of such a request. US officials fear China has already decided to provide Russia with economic and financial support and is contemplating sending military supplies such as armed drones. The Russian relationship remains important to Xi, and he is unlikely to jettison it in favour of aligning with a declining west, the director of the Asia programme at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, Bonnie Glaser, told China File. But he must decide to what extent he’ll help the Russian economy as sanctions – which China has long opposed – kick in. “China is likely to find ways to help Moscow mitigate the impact of the sanctions, without blatantly violating them. The playbook it has used to assist Iran and North Korea evade sanctions provides possible actions China can take.” China has little incentive to provide direct military aid, says Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australian National University. “Beijing’s preferences are: one, international stability; two, to ensure the Russian economy and polity does not collapse under the weight of the international sanctions, and three, to not be seen as an overt enabler of Russian aggression.” Hass says it’s more likely that China will remain “rhetorically committed to showing support for Russia” but will largely comply with international sanctions against it, in order to avoid attracting secondary sanctions. “I also expect China to remain cautious in providing any materiel support to Russia, given that such support likely would have limited impact on the outcome of hostilities in Ukraine, but significant impacts on China’s relations with the west.”",News/World news,How close are China and Russia and where does Beijing stand on Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/how-close-are-china-and-russia-and-where-does-beijing-stand-on-ukraine
3/17/2022,"On Tuesday’s Daily Show Trevor Noah found larger resonance in the tabloid headline situation between Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, and Pete Davidson. “One of the strangest things to try to wrap your head around – I find this especially in America – is when a story stops only applying to … not the industry it’s in but sort of the sector that it’s in, and when it starts effecting everybody or speaking to everybody,” he said. Some stories are purely tabloid, some purely sport, “but then some stories I feel transcend everything else and then speak to larger conversations”. That’s how Noah felt about West’s ongoing public harassment of his ex-wife, Kardashian, and Davidson, her new boyfriend. “It started very much in the land of tabloid,” he said, “but I feel it’s creeping and has crept into a world that more people should pay attention to but not for the reason that you may think.” West has been trying to win Kardashian back through increasingly belligerent public gestures and statements; he recently released a claymation music video in which West’s character chops off Davidson’s head. West has been open about his mental health struggles, but the video in particular made Noah “uncomfortable” because it’s unclear how seriously people should take the threats. The situation has “spun into a story that seems fully tabloid but I think deserves a little more awareness from the general public, because it touches on something that is more sensitive and more serious than people would like to admit,” he explained. “You may not feel sorry for Kim because she’s rich and famous, because of the way she dresses, because she appropriates black culture, because she tells women they’re lazy, broke the internet and then didn’t put it back together, whatever, you hate her,” Noah continued. “But what she’s going through is terrifying to watch, and it shines a spotlight on what so many women go through when they choose to leave.” Noah recalled growing up in an abusive household in South Africa, and how often people would tell his mother she was over-reacting, or question what she did that elicited the abuse and harassment. As a child, Noah saw “a world where women are questioned for what is happening to them as opposed to people questioning what is happening to them”. Noah was adamant that he was not calling West a bad guy, just asking society to think harder. “We have to ask ourselves questions. Do we wish to stand by and watch a car crash when we thought we saw it coming? Or do we at least want to say hey, slow down, let’s all put our hazards on because there’s a storm right now,” take threats seriously and look idiotic if they don’t pan out. “I’d rather be in that situation than to be in one where I say ‘Man, I wish we didn’t think the whole thing wasn’t worth looking at.’” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert rounded up more troubling news from Ukraine, starting with the Russian-occupied southern city of Melitopol, where “the new not-really-mayor” told residents that the city would broadcast Russian state television so people could “get accurate information”. “Yes, they’ll be treated to accurate Russian stories like ‘despite how you feel, you are happy,’ and they can watch the popular Russian state children’s program ‘Peppa Potato,’” Colbert joked. Earlier this week, leaders from Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia were in Kyiv to express solidarity with Ukraine. Because of the conflict, the leaders arrived by train. “Wow, the trains are still running there? European train service is so much better than ours,” Colbert said. “The only war zone you see on Amtrak is the bathroom.” Colbert also praised Marina Ovsyannikova, a producer and editor for Russian state television, who burst onto a nightly news broadcast with a sign protesting the war in Ukraine. The sign read, in part, “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” “That is a fantastic sign and a brave statement,” said Colbert. “I only have one bone to pick: ‘they’re lying to you here’ is already the motto of crypto.com.” Following her protest, Ovsyannikova wasn’t heard from for hours, but the Washington Post confirmed Tuesday that she was alive and wouldn’t be charged by the Kremlin for illegal speech. She was, however, found guilty of organizing an illegal protest and fined 30,000 rubles. “To which she said, ‘oh thank god, I thought you were going to ask for money,’” Colbert quipped. And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel celebrated the Senate’s passage of a bill that would make daylight saving time permanent in the US, “meaning we might never have to change the clock on the microwave again”. Numerous politicians have been trying to pass said legislation for years “but they kept getting clock-blocked,” Kimmel explained. The new bill, however, got unanimous support in the Senate. “When was the last time anything got an unanimous vote in the Senate?” Kimmel wondered. “They couldn’t even agree unanimously to condemn Asian-American hate crimes. Josh Hawley was like ‘Let’s not rush into anything’”. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida who was the lead sponsor for the bill, explained that “there’s strong science behind it that is now showing and making people aware of the harm that clock switching has.” “Well, good for you, Marco,” Kimmel deadpanned, “and wait until you find out about all the other things that have strong science behind them”.",Arts/Culture,Trevor Noah on Kanye’s harassment of Kim Kardashian: ‘What many women go through’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/16/trevor-noah-kanye-west-ye-harassment-kim-kardashian
3/17/2022,"It is incredibly hard not to react to Netflix’s new show Is It Cake? with anything but a wearied groan. It’s one of those infuriatingly packaged US cookery shows where every camera movement comes with a whoosh noise and the editing brief appears to be “make this feel like a panic attack”. It is hosted by a man who does not appear to have ever set foot inside a kitchen. The title has a question mark in it, which means that whenever a journalist writes Is It Cake? in the middle of a sentence, it makes them look groggy and bewildered. Most egregiously of all, though, the sole premise of Is It Cake? is a brief online fad from two years ago. Perhaps you know it. You will see a video of what you think is a shoe, then someone will cut it open and you realise that it is actually a cake. Or you’ll see a hamburger, but someone will cut it open and it’ll be a cake. Or a laptop, but it’s cake. You get the idea. This is where television has got to as a medium in the year 2022. Once it gave us The Ascent of Man, now it’s lobbing out old TikTok rip-offs. When humanity eventually comes to perish under the weight of its own hubris, the species that replaces us will come to see Is It Cake? as the moment things went irreparably wrong for us. So it gives me no joy to inform you that Is It Cake? may be the most pure brainless fun that has ever been created. I went into the first episode with my expectations in the toilet, then ended up wolfing down the whole stupid series in one go. I hate myself for it. I currently feel the same way I do after eating too much ice-cream. I am full of regret and dreading the consequences. I am almost certainly much stupider than I was a couple of days ago. But I couldn’t help it. The show was just too irresistible. Obviously Is It Cake? cannot simply be a remake of the viral videos, because that would just be several hours of people revealing that things that don’t look like cakes are actually cake, which would probably get old after about 20 seconds. Instead, Is It Cake? has bulked things out by handing a member of the Saturday Night Live cast a samurai sword. First, contestants have to inspect a bunch of stuff on some plinths and guess which one of them is a cake. Mikey Day (the SNL cast member on hosting duty), then tests whether it’s cake or not by chopping it up with his sword (at least for episode one, before they replace it with a knife later in the series). It’s worth pointing out that if your idea of entertainment doesn’t involve watching a man trying to chop a shoe in half before shouting “It is shoe! Not cake!” in defeat, you will get nothing from the show. But it’s also worth pointing out that if this is the case you are spiritually dead. The bulk of the show, however, takes the form of a fever dream Bake Off, where the contestants have to try to bake a cake that looks like something that isn’t a cake. If you wanted to be unnecessarily picky and find a part of Is It Cake? that has any intellectual worth at all, this is it. The bakers are all highly skilled and reveal the products and processes that can transform a cake into a thing. It’s fascinating to watch. Then some judges come in and have to guess whether the cake is real or not. In the event of a tie, the judges eat the cake to see which tastes best. This happens near the end of each episode and it always comes as a shock because it’s the first time that the cake gets treated like food, and not just an elaborate optical illusion for the delight of some idiots at home. Anyway, then the winner has to choose between two bags of cash, and if they choose the bag that isn’t a cake, they win. End of episode. Standing ovation, everyone. Look, these are trying times for all of us. Am I saying the only way to achieve anything even approaching joy is to watch a cynically conceived gameshow about a cake that looks like a hat? Sadly yes. Yes I am. This is as bad as things have got. Watch Is It Cake? now and be saved. Is It Cake? airs on Netflix on 18 March.",Arts/Television & radio,Is It Cake?
