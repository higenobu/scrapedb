2/3/2022,"A woman who was experiencing abnormal bleeding and abdominal pain made a shocking discovery at her gynecologist — and now, TikTokers are saying they’ll never forget stumbling across her story. Mom @sandwitchbread gained over 1.7 million views and 300,000 likes when she shared her stunning diagnosis with the world. While we’ve seen shocking medical mysteries go viral before — like the mom who went 25 years without knowing she had two vaginas, two cervixes and two uteruses — TikTokers say this is one of the strangest stories they’ve ever heard. And now, much like the mom who was horrified to discover hospital staff brought her the wrong baby not once, but twice, @sandwitchbread is encouraging all women to self-advocate for themselves at the doctor, especially when it comes to reproductive health.

In her now-viral video, @sandwitchbread explained that two years after giving birth to her son Atlas, she began developing strange symptoms. This week's Getting Rich episode, sponsored by Acura, offers tried and tested tips for saving up for that car, house payment or dream vacation When her doctor suggested they perform an ultrasound, the young mom grew nervous, fearing she was either pregnant or had cancer. Instead, @sandwitchbread was hit with shocking news: For the past two years, her body had been growing teeth and hair inside her uterus. She was informed it was a dermoid cyst, which is a growth of normal tissue enclosed in a pocket of cells. Occasionally, this growth can go on to develop bone, nerves, skin, sweat glands — or, in @sandwitchbread‘s case, teeth and hair. In fact, her body had been working overtime on the tissue, developing it into two dermoid cysts, one “chicken egg-sized,” and one “the size of a pea.” Her doctor explained that when her son was still in utero, traces of fetal tissue separated from the developing fetus, which went on to become a dermoid cyst. “So, for two years now, I’ve had particles of my son… growing in my uterus,” @sandwitchbread said in shock to the camera. She then issued a “viewer discretion” to anyone watching her video, and warned she would be putting up a photo of a dermoid cyst — which seemed to horrify many TikTokers. “You advised discretion for the photo and I THOUGHT I understood. But let me tell you, I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT PHOTO,” joked one user. “This was the most disturbing TikTok I’ve ever seen,” one viewer wrote. “Whoaaaa, that’s wild. I’ve never even heard of this. You learn something new every day,” another commented. “I will never be able to forget this. I should have looked away,” wrote another user. But while many viewers were shocked or grossed out by @sandwitchbread‘s video, many are thanking her for advocating for women’s health and sharing her experience with the world.  Now, the mom is encouraging everyone to seek medical attention if they’re experiencing unusual symptoms, and to self-advocate when they’re at the doctor’s office. And as for her strange cysts? She’s named them Seymour and Archibald Winklet, and she’ll be scheduling their removal in the coming months.

2/3/2022,"(Reuters) -Melinda French Gates is no longer pledging to donate most of her wealth to the charitable foundation she co-founded with her former husband and will instead disburse the funds among other philanthropies, the Wall Street Journal reported.    The 57-year-old Texas-raised computer scientist made the change in late 2021 following her divorce last year from Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter.    The couple had pledged in 2010 to give the bulk of their fortune to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was founded in 2000 and spent $55 billion in its first two decades, with a focus on combating poverty, inequity and disease.    A foundation spokesperson declined to comment beyond what French Gates outlined in her latest Giving Pledge letter, which she posted separately from Bill Gates.    ""I recognize the absurdity of so much wealth being concentrated in the hands of one person, and I believe the only responsible thing to do with a fortune this size is give it away - as thoughtfully and impactfully as possible,"" she wrote.    (Reporting by Nathan Layne in Wilton, Connecticut; Editing by Will Dunham and Tomasz Janowski) ",U.S./Reuters,"Melinda French Gates no longer plans to give most of wealth to Gates Foundation, WSJ reports",https://news.yahoo.com/melinda-french-gates-no-longer-150459502.html
2/3/2022,"Netflix's documentary ""The Tinder Swindler"" is about man who scammed women into debt. Shimon Hayut lied about his identity saying he was real-life billionaire diamond mogul Lev Leviev's son. His victims say he loved-bombed them until they sent money or gave him their credit cards. When 29-year-old Cecilie Fjellhøy met Simon Leviev on Tinder in 2018, she thought she'd scored the man of her dreams. He was handsome, generous, thoughtful, and rich. At the time, Leviev told Fjellhøy he worked for his billionaire father in the diamond industry. Their online relationship quickly evolved into dates on private jets and at five-star hotels, massive flower bouquets, and romantic banter over phone calls and texts. So when Fjellhøy learned Leviev had put her in debt for $250,000, an amount he once promised to return to her, she was stunned. She's still paying that money back today. In Netflix's documentary ""The Tinder Swindler,"" Fjellhøy and two other women who said they were victims of Leviev's scams, explain how they fell for the Israeli hustler, whose real name is Shimon Hayut. The documentary premieres on February 2. In 2019, Finnish investigative journalists, with help from women who said they were conned by Hayut, found out his true identity. He was arrested in Finland in 2015 for scamming three other women, but after two years in prison, he was back to scheming. Since 2018, he's scammed an estimated $10 million from women he's dated and families he's worked for, and has been reported to police in seven different countries, according to ""The Tinder Swindler."" In 2019, Hayut was sentenced to 15 months in an Israeli prison for fraud and identity theft and ordered to pay $43,289. But after five months, he was released and has since been spotted pretending to be a medic and cutting COVID-19 vaccine lines, according to the Times of Israel. Pernilla Sjoholm was another one of Hayut's fraud victims. Like Fjellhøy, Sjoholm met Hayut on Tinder and was intrigued by his apparent wealth and charisma. They decided to be friends instead of lovers, but she still lent Hayut enough money to put herself into debt, she said in the documentary. Hayut would say he needed to borrow Fjellhøy's credit card, or ask her to lend him money, saying he needed to appear untraceable due to his family's diamond business. Hayut said he was the son of real-life Russian-Israeli diamond mogul Lev Leviev, but an investigation later uncovered he has no ties to the Leviev family. But when Hayut would tell Fjellhøy, Sjoholm, and other women he feared for his safety and needed the money to run from his enemies, they felt they had no choice but to help the man they loved, his former lovers said in the documentary. They said Hayut would ask for money after weeks or months of love-bombing, or showering his Tinder matches with gifts, trips, and promises of a future together. He called Fjellhøy his ""future wife"" in one voice message, she told the journalists at outlet Verdens Gang who broke the story in 2019. ""It felt good to be able to give it to him and say, 'Here's my credit card. I managed it,'"" Fjellhøy told Verdens Gang. While Fjellhøy waited for the $500,000 Hayut promised to reimburse her to hit her account, she got a call from the bank saying he forged the document, and she would never get the money. She and other victims said they later learned Hayut would use one woman's money to buy another a plane ticket, or fund his own trips, giving the illusion of wealth. Fjellhøy and Sjoholm met once Finnish journalists began investigating their individual stories, and worked with a third victim, Ayleen Charlotte, to confirm Hayut's identity and have him arrested. In June 2019, Interpol and Israeli police arrested Hayut and charged him with fraud and identity theft. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison, but only served five months before being released. According to the Times of Israel, Hayut was released as part of a program to reduce inmate numbers and pandemic infections. According to the documentary, Hayut now lives in Israel.

2/3/2022,"⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious On January 29 the lives of 9 people were cut short, leaving countless loved ones mourning, all thanks to one man driving a Dodge Challenger recklessly. According to a local report, 59-year-old Gary Dean Robinson was behind the wheel of the Mopar muscle car when he ran a red light. Police say speed was a factor in the crash. It’s believed the muscle car was traveling over 100 mph as it entered the intersection. Learn why Paris, France is moving to ban motorcycles here. The crash involved six vehicles, with at least one person in critical condition and several more injured. Robinson was killed along with his passenger. Seven people who were riding in a Toyota Sienna were killed, including four children aged 5, 10, 13, and 15. We can only imagine the grief of their loved ones, especially given the senselessness of their deaths. Local reporters did some digging into Robinson’s past, uncovering the man had quite the criminal history connected to the Las Vegas Justice Court and Henderson Justice Court. The list stretches back to 1998 and includes six felonies such as battery on a police officer with substantial bodily harm and assault with a deadly weapon. The man received citations for speeding in the past. Clark County District D Commissioner William McCurdy II had some terse words to describe the fatal crash. ""What we are seeing is people are -- time after time -- breaking the law.” Police are investigating whether impairment was a factor in the horrific crash. Considering Robinson’s past, it’s fair to assume it could have been. The National Transportation and Safety Board is helping with the investigation. Law enforcement expressed frustration for an increase in speeding in southern Nevada, with citations for drivers going over 100 mph increasing “dramatically” over the past three years.
