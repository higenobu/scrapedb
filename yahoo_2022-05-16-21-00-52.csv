5/16/2022,"In the week ending May 12, mortgage rates rose for the ninth time in ten weeks. 30-year fixed rates rose by three basis points to 5.30%. 30-year fixed rates jumped by 17 basis points in the week prior. Year-on-year, 30-year fixed rates were up by 236 basis points. 30-year fixed rates were up by 36 basis points since November 2018’s last peak of 4.94%. Inflation was back in focus, which caused market turbulence mid-week. In April, the annual rate of inflation softened from 8.5% to 8.3% versus a forecasted 8.1%. The core annual rate of inflation eased from 6.5% to 6.2%. While softer, inflation was stronger than anticipated, supporting the more hawkish sentiment towards Fed monetary policy. Market jitters over the rising risk of a recession together with persistent inflation tested support for riskier assets. The weekly average rates for new mortgages, as of May 12, 2022, were quoted by Freddie Mac to be: 30-year fixed rates rose by three basis points to 5.30%. This time last year, rates stood at 3.06%.

The average fee increased from 0.8 points to 0.9 points. 5-year fixed rates increased by two basis points to 3.98%. Rates were up by 139 basis points from 2.58% a year ago. The average fee rose from 0.2 points to 0.3 points. According to Freddie Mac, Homebuyers showed resilience despite rising mortgage rates driving monthly payments up by around one-third compared with last year. A surge of first-time buyers supported buying demand. Monetary policy and inflation may discourage consumers in the months ahead, weakening purchase demand and slowing home price growth. For the week ending May 6, 2022, the rates were: Average interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances increased from 5.36% to 5.53%. Points rose from 0.63 to 0.73 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates backed by FHA increased from 5.27% to 5.37%. Points rose from 0.85 to 0.87 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances increased from 4.92% to 5.08 %. Points declined from 0.43 to 0.42 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans.

The Index rose by 2.5% in the previous week. The Refinance Index declined by 2% and was 72% lower than the same week one year ago. In the week prior, the Index rose by 0.2%. The refinance share of mortgage activity decreased from 33.9% to 32.4% of total applications. In the previous week, the share decreased from 35.0% to 33.9%.

While it is a slow start to the spring homebuying season, prospective buyers are showing interest amidst the higher rate environment. Purchase activity has increased for two consecutive weeks. The sharp rise in mortgage rates continues to hit the refinance market, with activity down 70% from a year ago. On Tuesday, retail sales will be the area of focus. While the numbers will influence, Fed Chair Powell and FOMC member chatter will also be the key in the week. The markets will be looking for Fed Chair Powell to back up comments from Friday and for members to align with his assurances. Last Friday, the Fed Chair assured the markets that larger rate hikes were off the table. Fed Chair Powell is to deliver a speech on Tuesday. Away from the economic calendar, news updates from China on lockdown measures and from Ukraine and Russia will also influence.

5/16/2022,"Last week S&P 500, Dow Jones, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 all broke below the major support and dropped sharply into an oversold condition. This sharp move was anticipated just right before it happened based on the bear market leading indicator as I discussed in the video at the bottom of the post. On Friday all the 4 indices had a strong rebound off the oversold condition. This is significant not because of the magnitude of the rally, but the market breadth because the difference between the number of stocks hit 52 Weeks High and 52 Weeks Low spiked from -1600 to -160. This is a sharp turn from a very bearish market breadth to almost neutral as majority of the stocks participated the reversal. Refer to the market breadth chart below: From the chart above, the spike of the market breadth after 24 January 2022 and 24 February 2022 (circled in orange) corresponded to a swing low in S&P 500. A market rally can be expected based on the current market breadth. Next, we need to determine the quality of the potential rally to anticipate how far it can go. Let’s apply the Wyckoff method to find out if this is likely a stock market bottom or a bull trap by focusing on the price action and the volume. Refer to the chart of S&P 500 Futures below: The bearish bias of S&P 500 was formed after the selloff happened in January 2022. Subsequently, a Wyckoff re-distribution pattern was formed (as highlighted in orange). After the upthrust after distribution (annotated as UTAD), the rallies were of poor quality and the down swings were impulsive and volatile with increasing of supply. These are the key characteristics of a bear market leading to a sign of weakness (annotated as SOW). The confirmation of the strong down swing was identified after the weak rally on 18 April 2022 (annotated as LPSY 0) where I explained in detail about the bearish signal detected from the Wyckoff distribution pattern in the video. Last week S&P 500 broke below the major support at 4100 followed by a sharp move down below 3900 within 4 days, which marked a sign of weakness from the re-distribution structure. Despite the sharp move down, climatic price action and volume did not show up, suggested pending institution capitulation. This is a key difference when comparing to the selling climax low formed on 24 January 2022. There was presence of demand on last Thursday as reflected on the demand tail and the slight increase of volume while the price hit the oversold of the down channel. This was confirmed by Friday’s price action. This is likely the relief rally to test the axis line near 4050-4100 where the support-turned-resistance. The resistance zone coincides with the supply line of the down channel, which could potentially form the last point of supply (annotated as LPSY 2) where the supply will be attracted for institutions to sell into strength (as annotated in green arrow) followed by lower price target at 3600 (and lower). This could be similar to the bear market in 2008 from the price structure to the market rotation sequence as discussed in the video 2 weeks ago. As mentioned earlier, watch the video below find out how to use this leading indicator in the bear market as early warning before the sharp move happened last week (and beyond) in S&P 500. Based on the characteristics of the price action and volume, selling into strength to avoid bull trap is a better bet. Under a more bullish scenario where the current rally is strong enough to test 4200, a trading range could be anticipated rather than a continuation of the selloff to test 3600 in the short-term.
