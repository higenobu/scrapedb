3/23/2022,"That Tesla (TSLA) is a law unto itself is already well-established. And assessing the current state of the auto industry, Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois thinks the EV leader is once again operating on another level. “We have been trimming estimates across our OEM coverage, but we are raising them at Tesla on price increases more than compensating risk from volume and battery cost inflation. With cash accumulating at a faster pace than Tesla's ability to grow physically, we look forward to Elon Musk revealing Master Plan Part 3,” Houchois noted. That last part is a reference to Musk’s recent tweet. Based on how “transparent and prescient” previous versions were, Houchois anticipates the plan will “extend well beyond financing, storage and FSD, as these would barely dent a fast-growing cash pile.” Houchois’ comments and boost for revenue/EPS targets between 2022 and 2024 come off the back of Jefferies’ recent auto conference, where the positive message put forward by Tesla has resulted in his confident take. That said, there are still risks to take into account; supply chain woes, of course, and mostly to do with the global chip shortage. However, these are mitigated by the price hikes noted above and other bullish developments. Production is already ongoing at the Austin plant, the Berlin factory is set to open tomorrow (March 22), the Shanghai facility is on course to expand capacity toward 1 million units while a new plant should also be announced during the course of 2022. Rather than focusing on affordability, Tesla has also made “maximising profitability” a priority this year, which given current constraints makes sense but also appears to Houchois to be “more tactical than strategic.” While Houchois’ rating on TSLA remains a Buy, considering the “riskier macro and geopolitical environment for valuation,” the analyst has lowered the price target from $1,400 to $1,250. Still, there’s upside of ~36% from current levels. (To watch Houchois’s track record, click here) Overall, most analysts are in Tesla’s corner, though certainly not all are on board; the stock’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 15 Buys, 6 Holds and 6 Sells. Going by the $46.22 average price target, the forecast calls for share appreciation of ~15% over the 12-month timeframe.

3/23/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Just as worries from the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and surging Covid cases pummel Chinese stocks, a local hedge fund that jumped almost 30 times over the past five years by picking undervalued shares is ready to dive in. Most Read from Bloomberg China Jet’s Nosedive From 29,000 Feet Baffles Crash Specialists Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Will Join NATO Summit Via Video Link China Plane Crash Update: Pilots Didn’t Answer Calls as Jet Dove Guangdong Zhengyuan Private Fund Investment Management Co., which saw its assets surge fivefold from the start of last year to about 14 billion yuan ($2.2 billion) now, is planning to raise money again next month as stock valuations become increasingly attractive, founder and fund manager Liao Maolin said. “With the market having fallen to this level, there are so many stocks that I want to buy now but we have no more money” as the company is already fully invested, he said in a March 8 phone interview from Guangzhou, where the company is based. While that sounds like a risky bet, Liao has built a solid track record after his funds returned a whopping 2,944% since 2017, topping five-year rankings for stock hedge funds at Shenzhen PaiPaiWang Investment & Management Co. His rationale is simple: all the gloom out there -- from the war in Ukraine to monetary tightening in the U.S. and economic headwinds at home -- reinforces the possibility that policy makers will refrain from pricking more bubbles and move faster to spur encouraged areas like new infrastructure and digital transformation. “Everything you see this year could be bad news and uncertainty, but the government will likely take counter-cyclical measures,” Liao, 37, said. “The negative news you see has been mostly priced in and we would instead see more unexpected policy support down the road.” His comments were borne out last week, when Beijing pledged to stabilize markets, a move that triggered the biggest two-day rally in Chinese stocks since 1998. Policy makers are now expected to loosen monetary policy and ease up on technology and property industry crackdowns. Liao favors middle- and downstream firms in emerging strategic industries like batteries and new-energy vehicle parts, he said, declining to name specific targets. Such companies now suffering from soaring raw material costs will only benefit when commodity prices eventually subside, according to Liao. By sticking to areas supported by the government and steering clear of those in the cross-hairs of regulators, Zhengyuan has avoided “land mines” from real estate developers to internet platforms, which have imposed huge losses on investors in the past two years. For the same reason, the company has shunned once-hot stocks like liquor makers that mutual funds were heavily exposed to, as well as gaming industry shares -- even as those could perform well. ‘Positive Energy’ “What we buy is full of positive energy -- we walk in the sunshine,” Liao said. “Therefore it’s very unlikely for us to step on policy or ethical mines.” The firm’s Zhengyuan No. 1 fund, which manages more than 1 billion yuan, gained more than 160% last year by focusing on upstream plays like rare earths, industrial silicon and raw materials for new-energy vehicles -- areas that benefited from the local economy’s rebound from that stage of the pandemic. This year, Liao said he’s focusing instead more on downstream firms, in industries including new energy infrastructure such as charging piles for electric vehicles, database construction, information security and environmental protection. He reckons depressed valuations due to high costs will translate into profits when their performance rebounds. “The surge in commodity prices clearly can’t be sustained,” he said. When tensions in Ukraine escalated ahead of Russia’s invasion, Zhengyuan added to its photovoltaic holdings in anticipation that higher costs of traditional energy like natural gas would fuel demand for solar power in Europe, Liao said, declining to provide details. Such investments returned about 40% last year, he said. Zhengyuan targets undervalued stocks that are expected to show substantial improvements within a year to attract other investors, providing it with opportunities to realize profits, Liao said. It borrows leverage less than 30% but doesn’t short. While stock prices and economic growth fluctuate, the key for long-term returns at Zhengyuan is picking the right industries and companies. “The structure is really important these days,” Liao said. “When you get it right, it feels good every time. When you get it wrong, it can really hurt.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Silicon Valley’s Wealthiest Russian Is Carefully—Very Carefully—Distancing Himself From Putin China Bets on $1.5 Trillion of Tax Cuts in Quest for Growth The Future of Boosters Is Somewhere Between Unnecessary and Urgent Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•12 hours ago,"Hedge Fund Up 3,000% in Five Years Can’t Buy Enough China Stocks",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-fund-3-000-five-210000887.html
