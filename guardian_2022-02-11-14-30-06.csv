2/11/2022,"The mine at the centre of the decade-long civil war between rebels in Bougainville and Papua New Guinea security forces is set to reopen 30 years after it was forced to close, following an agreement between local landowners. Panguna was once one of the world’s largest and most profitable copper and goldmines and still contains an estimated 5.3m tons of copper and 19.3m ounces of gold, which would make the reserves worth about $60bn at today’s prices.  In 1989, amid rising community anger at the environmental damage and the inequitable division of the mine’s profits, locals forced the mine closed, blowing up Panguna’s power lines and sabotaging operations. The PNG government sent in troops against its own citizens to restart the foreign-owned mine, sparking a bloody, decade-long civil war. A peace settlement was brokered in 2001. On Wednesday, five customary landowner groups – the Kurabang, Barapang, Bakoringu, Basikang and Mantaa clans – signed a joint resolution on the mine reopening at a summit in Tunuru, central Bougainville, local media reported. At the gathering, Bougainville president Ishmael Toroama had asked the groups to find an outcome that would support the region’s aspirations for independence. “If we are talking about a new Bougainville, we must reset and refocus our priorities,” he told them. Wednesday’s resolution signified “the beginning of a new chapter, a chapter to realise Bougainville’s independence”, he said. Since his election in September 2020, Toroama has maintained that the reopening of the Panguna mine would be a decision for the land owners but that it is the only option that could provide the economic support for Bougainville’s independence. Specifics of the reopening are to be discussed in separate, follow-up meetings. The autonomous region’s Department of Mineral and Energy Resources is to liaise with the landowners. The national government has yet to comment on the decision. The civil war claimed the lives of about 20,000 people and amplified calls for Bougainvillean independence. The Bougainville Peace Agreement, signed between Bougainvillean leaders and Papua New Guinea in 2001, marked the end of the war and guaranteed a referendum on independence, to be held in 2019. The non-binding results of that referendum showed overwhelming support for independence, with 98% of people voting in favour, but are yet to be ratified in Papua New Guinea’s parliament, which has the final say on the process.",News/World news,Panguna mine at centre of bloody Bougainville conflict set to reopen after 30 years,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/panguna-mine-at-centre-of-bloody-bougainville-conflict-set-to-reopen-after-30-years

2/11/2022,"The 15-year-old Russian skater Kamila Valieva tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine in a sample collected on Christmas Day, the Independent Testing Agency has confirmed. However Valieva’s sample, which was taken by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada), was only analysed by a Swedish laboratory on Tuesday 8 February. That was a day after she led athletes representing the Russian Olympic Committee to gold in the team figure-skating.  The medal ceremony for the Russian team’s victory – in which Valieva hit two quad jumps – was subsequently suspended. It is still unclear whether the ROC will lose their medal or if Valieva will be allowed to compete in the individual figure skating event on Tuesday. Valieva continued to train in Beijing on Friday, but did not talk to the media. She is allowed to practise after she challenged her provisional suspension and a Rusada committee ruled in her favour. However that decision is now being challenged by the International Olympic Committee, and her legal case is ongoing. In a long and detailed statement, the ITA stressed that Valieva is “a ‘Protected Person’ under the World Anti-Doping Code – this status applies to persons under the age of 16.”The ITA added: “To state the facts chronologically, a sample from the athlete was collected under the testing authority and results management authority of the Rusada on 25 December 2021, during the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships in Saint Petersburg, Russia.“The Wada-accredited laboratory of Stockholm, Sweden, reported that the sample had returned an Adverse Analytical Finding for the non-specified prohibited substance trimetazidine on 8 February 2022. Following this, the athlete was provisionally suspended by Rusada with immediate effect.” The ITA also confirmed that a provisional suspension would usually prohibit Valieva from competing, training, coaching, or participating in any activity, during the Winter Olympics.However Valieva can continue to train as she challenged Rusada’s decision on 9 February. Later that day Rusada’s disciplinary committee decided to lift her provisional suspension, thus allowing her to continue her participation in Beijing. “The reasoned decision, including the grounds for which the provisional suspension was lifted, will be issued shortly to all concerned parties,” the ITA said.The IOC has now exercised its right to appeal and not to wait for the reasoned decision by Rusada, as it says a ruling is needed before the next competition Valieva is due to take part in. At Friday’s IOC briefing, spokesman Mark Adams refused to be drawn on the specifics of the case but said he hoped it would be settled sooner rather than later.“We took a decision some time ago to delegate all doping matters to the ITA and CAS and therefore we are not involved in this specific case,” he said.",Sport/Sport,ITA confirms Russia’s Kamila Valieva tested positive for banned substance,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/10/kamila-valieva-russian-skater-positive-test-winter-olympics-trimetazidine
