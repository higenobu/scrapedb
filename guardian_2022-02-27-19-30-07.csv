2/27/2022,"Energy companies are adopting increasingly aggressive debt collection practices and sharpening their communications with customers to increase profits, a leading fuel poverty charity has warned. National Energy Action (NEA) said householders are being forced into significantly worse situations than in previous years, including higher direct debits without change of usage, unaffordable debt repayment plans and prepayment meters, as energy companies accelerate debt collection to recoup costs. The charity reported customers being “aggressively chased” for payments and said that letters and other communications from companies have become considerably sharper and arrive faster than normal. With bills set to rise by 54% in April, which is expected to push even more people into debt, NEA warned that if energy companies do not change their practices it will lead to an increase in energy rationing and self-disconnections. Customers told the Observer of being chased by debt collection departments within the 14-day bill payment period. “What’s driving this is that over the past few months, suppliers have been unable to make a profit so chasing debt becomes much more important for them as a business and that’s what leads to this change in tactics to reduce levels of debt they see,” said Matt Copeland, the NEA’s head of policy and public affairs. Energy companies are required by regulator Ofgem to set debt repayment plans based on what customers are able to pay. But Copeland said that when customers go into debt, companies are being “less proactive” in ensuring that repayment plans are affordable for customers. Meanwhile, he said some customers are being subjected to the “double whammy” of unaffordable debt payment plans and rising direct debits at once. “Overall the process around debt and escalation is sharpening up and we’re seeing people getting into that process a lot more quickly.” The NEA is seeing particularly acute problems among customers whose debts were transferred to administrators rather than their new supplier when their energy companies went into administration. “In these cases, we are seeing much more aggressive debt collection practices which bypass a lot of necessary protections, especially for the most vulnerable customers,” said Copeland. He called on Ofgem and the government to take action to close the loopholes that make it possible, especially ahead of April’s cost rise. Annamaria Bridson from south Wales was so surprised to receive an email from Ovo Energy’s debt collections department, just five days after receiving a bill earlier this month, that she thought it might be a scam. Not only did the bill for her late mother’s property state that she had 14 days to settle, but she had already paid it. “It’s absolutely dreadful,” she said. “To receive an email from a debt collections department five days after receiving a bill? That is going to cause anybody to panic.” A 49-year-old from London, who receives disability benefits and did not want to be named, said she had been in debt to EDF Energy for some time. Recently she had seen an escalation in letters from the company, which was detrimental to her mental health. “I’m paying £50 off and then you’re adding £50 two days later. How am I ever going to get out of debt?” The Money Advice Trust, which runs National Debtline, reported issues with customers being told they have to pay more than what they can afford in monthly arrears and direct debit payments and vulnerable circumstances not being taken into consideration. They called on Ofgem and suppliers “to work together to agree a new energy plan to help people in energy debt.” Ofgem said debt management “must be done in a fair and reasonable way at all times, including communicating and taking account of customers’ ability to pay.” A spokesperson said: “Suppliers cannot extend unlimited credit to customers, but we will not tolerate sharp practice or aggressive debt collection.” An Ovo spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry to Ms Bridson for the shortfalls in service she experienced. We can confirm the account is now updated.” An EDF spokesperson said it would look into the customer’s case and added: “With regards to customers with debt issues, at EDF we are committed to doing all we can to ensure customers are well supported.” The spokesperson also said that EDF made a loss in 2021.",Lifestyle/Money,UK energy firms ‘chasing customers to pay more than they can afford’,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/27/uk-energy-firms-chasing-customers-to-pay-more-than-they-can-afford
2/27/2022,"This time last week, Arsenii Nikolaiev was studying hard. Now the third-year maths student at Trinity College, Cambridge, finds it near-impossible to concentrate. “Compared to people who are hearing bombardments every day, things are awesome. I can sit at a cafe, order anything, eat, fall asleep, and not be afraid that some explosion will happen above me,” he said. “But I feel pretty mentally bad. I can’t go about my normal life. It’s really hard to focus. I haven’t done a single thing for the past few days.” Half Russian and half Ukrainian, the Moscow-born 21-year-old is caught between two nations at war. In recent days, Pskov, the Russian city where his father was born, has become a launchpad for planes bound for Kyiv, the under-siege Ukrainian city where his mother was born. While his parents have emigrated, he still has family in both countries: his grandparents remain in Kyiv with his brother, 25, who “will probably be forced to take a weapon”. Another grandmother lives in Russia. “She hasn’t been in touch with me,” he said. “She barely knows how to use a computer and watches state TV so she might not know what’s really happening.” A member of both the Russian and Ukrainian societies at Cambridge, Nikolaiev describes himself as “half and half”. But when it comes to Putin and war, he is 100% sure which side he is on. Every day since the invasion began, he has joined demonstrations condemning the aggression and calling for more decisive action from the west. “Nationalities don’t matter. Putin and his friends are crazy; it doesn’t automatically mean all Russians are bad. The point is that peaceful people can die because one guy is crazy. People who I love and are my friends are in danger,” he said. Most of the Russians he knows have been vocal in their opposition to the invasion. But he has been frustrated by the reactions of a small number, who have failed to condemn Putin outright. “I have encountered people who are avoiding mentions of Ukraine and saying things like, ‘We are very sad that some bad things are happening,’” he said. “It’s like saying slavery is a dispute between people of a different colour.” Andrii Smytsniuk, a language teaching officer in Ukrainian at Cambridge, has noticed the same reluctance among some of the Russians he speaks to. “They sometimes call it the Ukraine crisis or the civil war in Ukraine, or an ‘unfortunate event’. But this is no longer a crisis: it’s a full-scale, Russian invasion,” he said. “Ukraine is a war zone. My mother woke up yesterday at 5am just counting how many planes were coming over the rooftop and she counted 10 in one hour. It’s very important to call it what it actually is.” Many more Russian colleagues and friends have written to him in support, or attended the protests he has helped arrange. At the demonstrations in Cambridge, as at others across the UK, Russians have stood alongside Ukrainian friends, colleagues and strangers in a show of solidarity, brandishing Ukrainian flags and joining in with crowds singing the national anthem. “I have received many letters of support from my Russian colleagues and there have been quite a lot coming to the protests. We greatly, greatly appreciate it,” Smytsniuk said. Among those who showed their support last week was Sergei, an engineer from Moscow who stood shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians at a protest in Cambridge on Friday. “I can’t believe what my country is doing to another country,” he said. “Unfortunately it is not possible for people in Russia to speak out. That is why I came here.” The 40-year-old, who asked not to give his second name, still has family in Russia, where thousands have been arrested. In the relative safety of Cambridge, Sergei felt brave enough to brandish a small cardboard sign declaring his position. “I am Russian and I condemn Putin’s aggression against Ukraine. Stop Putin, stop the war, free Ukraine,” it said.All his friends are against the war, as far as he knows. “There is a big Russian community in Cambridge and I don’t know anyone who supports Putin. If there is someone, they keep silent,” he said. Another Russian national said he could not speak openly but was “absolutely opposed” to the invasion. “The only thing that will come from this is destabilisation and long-lasting animosity,” he said. “It’s never fun to piss millions of people off.” Jana Bakunina, 42, an author from Ekaterinburg, Russia, who now lives in London, said there were Russians in the UK who “refuse to open their eyes to the facts”. “There are Russians in London who right now are watching Russian federal channels over the internet and are saying that there are tens of thousands of people who have died in the separatist regions because of being undermined by the Ukrainian government’s army,” she said. “There are some people who think that. But I don’t think that, and most people don’t.” The “overwhelming emotion” she feels is “helplessness”. “I am very ashamed of what the Russian government is doing,” she said. “With every cell of my being I am anti-war. And for this to happen, that we are the aggressor… how do you live with that?”",News/World news,‘I am Russian and I condemn Putin’s aggression against Ukraine’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/i-am-russian-and-i-condemn-putins-aggression-against-ukraine
2/27/2022,"Councils will have to cut key services to pay for the “soul-destroying” damage caused by three unprecedented storms across the UK, local leaders have said. Storms Dudley, Eunice and Franklin brought hurricane-force winds and heavy rain to large parts of the UK in the past week, leaving more than 1m homes without power and hundreds under water. Local authorities said they faced multimillion-pound bills to clean up and repair damage to roads, bridges and other infrastructure, at a time when many are making swingeing cuts to essential services due to a 37% drop in their government funding since 2010. Lezley Picton, the Conservative leader of Shropshire council, said: “We need some emergency funding. A million pounds is what it costs to clean up – after that it is significantly more if you take into account the long-term damage it does to our highways.” She added: “It has to come out of council coffers and we’re not very well funded; 84% of our budget goes on social care. It means cutting our cloth accordingly and it probably means not doing something that we were going to do.” Figures provided to the Guardian show at least 650 homes and businesses were flooded in Shropshire, Worcestershire, York, Wales and the Yorkshire village of Tadcaster, although the true number of properties affected is acknowledged to be far higher. The Environment Agency said the “unprecedented weather” had caused river levels to near historic highs in some areas, causing flood barriers to be breached. However, it said about 40,000 properties had been protected. Council leaders complained about a lack of a long-term strategy from government about containing heavy rainfall upstream. They said flood prevention strategies focused too often on relatively small areas instead of region-wide or cross-boundary mitigations. Picton said: “The 2000 floods were said to be a once-in-30-year flood and since then we’ve probably had seven or 10. Now it seems to be one every year and we can’t continue like this. For some people this is the third [flood] in three years. It’s soul-destroying.” In York, about 60 properties were flooded when the river Ouse neared its highest ever recorded level on Tuesday. Paula Widdowson, a Lib Dem councillor and executive member for the environment on City of York council, urged the government to establish a £200-300m pot of emergency funding that areas could easily access during damaging storms. Local authorities can apply retrospectively for funding from the government’s Bellwin scheme, although that only covers costs incurred in the immediate response to weather events and does not fund the repairs or long-term recovery. Widdowson said York was having to find more than £1m to fix the flood-damaged Lendal Bridge, a 159-year-old iron bridge connecting the historic city, plus thousands more to clean up. She said: “It’s the local governments who are going to have to fund this out of their council tax or from somewhere, whether it’s not filling the potholes in the road, whether it’s not looking after the children properly, whether it’s closing the library. “We’re not going to take it from children and we’re not going to take it from libraries, so it’s where can we take it from? We’ve all got very, very, very low budgets.” The historic site of Ironbridge, in Shropshire, a world heritage site, was inundated for the third time in as many years and dozens of home were evacuated as the River Severn almost overtopped flood barriers this week. Shaun Davies, the leader of Telford & Wrekin council, said there needed to be “a more permanent solution” to protect the site from repeatedly severe weather. He said: “We need to see changes to the local government funding formula to support both our role as Lead Local Flood Agencies and allow us to support investment in flood defences to recognise rural need, heritage, history and tourism.” In South Yorkshire, where low-lying villages were devastated by storms in 2019, Storms Eunice and Franklin caused huge disruption to major travel networks as Rotherham rail station was flooded and the major Snake Pass road, connecting Sheffield to Manchester, has been closed for several weeks due to landslips. Dan Jarvis, the Sheffield city region mayor, said there was a £118m funding gap from government that meant it could not start 27 “priority” flood defence projects, including nine that could begin later this year with the right support.",News/UK news,Councils ‘will have to cut key services to pay for UK storm damage’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/27/councils-will-have-to-cut-key-services-to-pay-for-uk-storm-damage
2/27/2022,"In December 2021, Patrick Radden Keefe travelled to London from New York to attend the Business Book of the Year award ceremony at the National Gallery. He had been shortlisted for Empire of Pain, his exhaustive portrait of three generations of the Sackler family, one of the world’s wealthiest and most secretive corporate dynasties. For decades the Sackler name was synonymous with often extravagant art world philanthropy – since 2009, the Sackler Trust had given around £170m to art institutions in Britain alone. Of late, though, it has been tarnished by its association with OxyContin, the addictive painkiller at the heart of the ongoing opioid epidemic in America that has claimed around 500,000 lives there. Keefe’s book, which is about to be published in paperback, reveals in forensic detail how the Sacklers’ vast fortune was built in part on the profits made by their company, Purdue Pharma, which manufactured and aggressively marketed OxyContin to physicians who prescribed it in often dangerously high doses. It is an epic, intricately structured tale of obsession, greed and dizzying corporate irresponsibility, which has been lauded by the critics, awarded the 2021 Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction and become a global bestseller. Though flattered to be on the Business Book of the Year shortlist, Keefe felt ambivalent about the award, not least because it was co-sponsored by McKinsey & Company, a global management consultancy hired in 2007 by Purdue to “turbocharge” sales of OxyContin. In February of last year, McKinsey announced a settlement of almost $600m against lawsuits filed by 49 US states over its role in the opioid crisis, while also refusing to admit liability. “Although it was an exciting and illustrious event and a nice validation,” Keefe tells me, “I was sick with anxiety because McKinsey was one of the villains in my book. I kept thinking: what happens if I win? If I accepted the award, would I be any different to all the art institutions who took the money and looked the other way and were co-opted into the system?” As he mingled with guests and fellow nominees over pre-dinner drinks, the irony was compounded when his British book editor drew his attention to a sign above an adjacent gallery: the Sackler Room. “So, there we were,” he says, smiling wryly, “adjacent to space named in honour of the Sacklers, while I’m waiting to see if I’d won the McKinsey prize.” To his relief, he didn’t. What, though, would he have done if he had? “It would have been supremely awkward,” he replies, shaking his head. “I would have had to say what I ended up writing on Twitter the next day, having gathered my thoughts, which was basically that I could not have accepted the money. Thankfully, everyone was spared that embarrassment.” (Like all the shortlisted authors, Keefe did receive £10,000, which he donated to Odyssey House, a drug rehabilitation centre in New York.) He relates this anecdote, he says, because it neatly illustrates one of the underlying themes of his book. “Basically, the system through which this kind of reputation laundering happens is now so integrated and evolved that it is almost inescapable. The situation I found myself in at the award ceremony is kind of emblematic of that.” I am chatting to Keefe over a video link to his home in Westchester County, in the Hudson Valley, north of New York, where he lives with his wife, a lawyer, and their two children. He’s affable and well-spoken; one can see how his charm might put interviewees at ease, whether silver-tongued corporate lawyers or, as in the case of his previous book, Say Nothing, hardened IRA veterans. Published in 2018, the latter won the Orwell prize for political writing for its intricate exploration of the dark circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Jean McConville, a widowed mother of 10, who was abducted from her home in Belfast’s Divis Flats in 1972 by armed men. In 1999, the IRA admitted executing her, insisting that she had been passing information to the security forces, a charge which her family vehemently deny, and which was discredited by a later police ombudsman investigation. I suggest to Keefe that both books deal, in their different ways, with loyalty, deceit, denial and tarnished ideals. “There are definitely certain themes I am interested in and seem to return to,” he says. “One is the notion that someone can have an ideal that they relentlessly pursue, or a theory that they plunge headlong into, and it turns out that they were wrong. Either they were wrong about what the end would be, or they were wrong about the means and what it would cost. What I’m really fascinated by is what happens to them when they start getting these indications that they are wrong. What do they do? In a way, that dilemma is at the heart of both books, which are both essentially human dramas.” Part of what makes Empire of Pain so compelling, though, is that no one admits they were wrong. “I know!” he says. “Not only did they not admit they had got it wrong and decide to pull the drug from the shelves, they didn’t even say: ‘Maybe let’s just slow it all down here.’” As Empire of Pain makes clear, the Sacklers were so adept at laundering their reputation that, for decades, their philanthropic largesse had given them an almost saintly status in the art world. For too long, the grateful recipients seemed unconcerned about the ethics of how their benefactors made their fortune. That all began to change in March 2019, when the National Portrait Gallery became the first major art institution to refuse Sackler money, announcing that it would no longer be accepting £1m that had been pledged by the trust towards a proposed building project. The decision was widely regarded as a moral victory for a high-profile anti-Sackler activist campaign led by the American art photographer Nan Goldin, who, having overcome heroin addiction in the 1980s, had become addicted to OxyContin in 2014 after being prescribed it for tendonitis in her left wrist. A month before the NPG’s announcement, Goldin told the Observer: “I have been invited to have a retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery and I have told them I would not do it if they take the Sackler money.” Goldin’s activism was sparked by an article she read in the New Yorker in 2017 entitled The Family That Built an Empire of Pain. It was written by Keefe and became the starting point for his book. “It exposed the Sackler family as the billionaire puppet masters who ignited the opioid crisis,” she later recalled. “I read the article and became furious. I’d always thought of the Sacklers as philanthropists in museums I went to as a kid... I worshipped Act Up [a grassroots political activist group formed during the Aids pandemic in the late 1980s], so I decided I would do something and that I would do it in the museums, because I figured that’s where the Sacklers would listen.” Goldin launched the organisation Pain (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now), which has held demonstrations at several major art institutions that have taken funding from the Sacklers. In New York, Pain dropped fake prescriptions for OxyContin into the atrium of the Guggenheim Museum and scattered empty medicine bottles across the floors of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They also staged noisy protests in the Louvre in Paris and the V&A in London. Over the past few months, on the back of this direct-action campaign, several galleries began reluctantly to take notice of the damage being done to their own reputations by their association with Sackler money. In December 2021, the Metropolitan Museum in New York removed the Sackler name from seven of its galleries. Earlier this month, both Tate Britain and Tate Modern began removing plaques bearing the name – the former from the central octagon and a gallery, the latter from escalators, lifts and a gallery. Other institutions, including the Royal Botanic Gardens and Kettle’s Yard gallery in Cambridge, have decided to do the same, while the Globe theatre is looking for a replacement donor. As yet, the V&A, the British Museum and the National Gallery have resisted pressure to dissociate themselves from the family. The V&A’s chairman, Nicholas Coleridge, recently expressed his gratitude to Dame Theresa Sackler, wife of Mortimer Sackler, co-owner with his brother Raymond of Purdue Pharma, and insisted the gallery would not be removing the family’s name from their walls. “We don’t think there’s very much to be gained by taking that step,” he said, loftily. “We don’t think, at the moment, there’s much pressure to do so.” Keefe smiles and shakes his head when I mention this. “This is a gallery where Nan Goldin staged a die-in!” he says. “You almost have to admire that level of detachment from reality.” Keefe grew up in Boston, in a predominantly Irish-American neighbourhood in Dorchester. His route into non-fiction writing was, to say the least, circuitous. He studied law at Yale, International Relations at Cambridge and wrote a master’s thesis on state surveillance at the London School of Economics, at what he calls “an interesting paranoid moment when everyone was starting to wonder: can they actually listen to every phone call and read all our emails?” Soon after he finished his studies in London and returned to America, 9/11 happened. “Suddenly,” he says, “the stuff I’d been researching about the National Security Agency was a lot more germane.” He sent a book proposal to Tina Bennett, an American literary agent whose name he had noticed in the acknowledgments of two books he had recently read – Eric Schlosser’s Fast Food Nation and Malcolm Gladwell’s The Tipping Point. “I often think, if she hadn’t responded, would I be just another miserable lawyer today?” he says, laughing. Keefe describes the resulting book, Chatter: Dispatches From the Secret World of Global Eavesdropping (2005), as the result of “youthful hubris”. He took a year off law school to write it and, on his return, embarked on what he describes as “a completely tedious course on aspects of contract law” at New York University . Often, he would sit at the back of the lecture hall and peruse the New York Post and New York Daily News, while feigning interest in the lectures. That summer, the local tabloids were obsessed with a woman known as Sister Ping, leader of a so-called Snakehead gang, a lucrative human smuggling operation that brought thousands of people into the US from China using forged documents. “The tabloids were reporting on her trial daily, and all these big Chinese gangsters were testifying,” Keefe says. “It was such an extraordinary story that I pitched to the New Yorker and, to my surprise, got the assignment, just weeks away from going to work in a law firm.” The New Yorker published his piece, The Snakehead, in April 2006, and in 2009 a book of the same name came out. Subsequent books Say Nothing and Empire of Pain also began as long-form New Yorker features. “I like the metabolism of working there and doing those sorts of pieces,” he says. “Writing for the New Yorker was something I dreamed of when I was at college.” In the afterword to Say Nothing, he describes his approach as “narrative non-fiction”. How would he define the term? He thinks for a moment. “I worked as a research assistant for thehistorian Simon Schama at Columbia and he would always talk about narrative history – that he was not just writing for other historians. In my own way, I want to write something that is sophisticated and rigorous but approachable by anyone. You don’t have to have an interest in big pharma or the Troubles, because hopefully the characters and their dynamics will be rich and intriguing enough that I can pull you into their world.” His books, I say, are often as suspenseful and as tightly structured as crime fiction. “Well, that’s good to hear… I do use certain devices that may be more familiar from fiction. I’m thinking about a person reading my book on the subway. You don’t take that reader for granted, so you cannot be shy about thinking about character and suspense and editing in a way that’s compelling for the reader.” For Say Nothing, which explores the darkest aspects of the Troubles through a single killing, Keefe drew on long interviews given to others – including the veteran Irish journalist and author Ed Moloney – by former IRA members. One of them was with Dolours Price, who before her death admitted that she had driven McConville across the border into County Louth, where she was executed. I wondered if Keefe’s interest in the dark dramas of the Troubles emerged from his Irish-American upbringing. “People see my name and know I come from Boston, so they often assume I must have some personal connection, which is not true. I’d never heard of Dolours Price until I read her obituary in 2013, but she was so fascinating on so many levels. This was someone who took people across the River Styx, but, in middle age, she was having misgivings. The collision between her beliefs and her humanity was right there on the surface.” Intriguingly, Keefe’s on-the-ground research for Say Nothing seems to have been less risky than his investigations for Empire of Pain. In the afterword to that book, he recounts how in the summer of 2020 a neighbour told him that he had spotted a stranger lingering ominously outside his house. “It did make me feel a bit jumpy,” he says. “What upset me most is that our boys were present when he told us. Ideally this would not have been something that my two small kids, who were seven and nine at the time, would have heard. I think it was unsettling for them. Nan Goldin had something similar, but it was much more in-your-face. But these things happen. It comes with the territory.” In both Say Nothing and Empire of Pain, it is the characters at the heart of the narratives that most intrigue. The latter begins with the ascendency of Arthur Sackler, a psychiatrist who believed that depression was a chemical imbalance in the brain best treated by chemicals rather that electro shock therapy. In many ways, his complex personality – obsessive, ruthlessly ambitious, philanthropic and almost neurotically secretive – is a template for the company itself. As Keefe puts it, “He sought posterity but not publicity.” Likewise, Sackler’s determination to “do things the way I want to do them” included taking over a medical advertising agency and launching a weekly medical newspaper distributed to American physicians in which most of the products advertised, including Librium and Valium, were produced by that agency’s clients, which included Hoffmann-La Roche. By 1973, as the age of big pharma began in earnest, some 20 million Americans were on Valium. The drug’s extraordinary success was a precursor to the OxyContin marketing campaign launched by Sackler’s nephew Richard a generation later, who promised “a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition”. What struck me as I read Empire of Pain, I say, was the sense that the culture of deception, followed by denial, that defined almost every aspect of the Sackler-Purdue Pharma enterprise may in some way also now define contemporary corporate capitalism as a whole. That and the fact that although a $6bn settlement seems to have been reached to compensate the victims, no one has yet been held criminally accountable. Does he think that the super-rich are now, to a degree, beyond the law? “Well, my perception is that the goalposts keep moving, so that things that used to be out of bounds are no longer. Lobbyists are a good example. There are now all kinds of ways in which the deployment of influence and the deployment of money in pursuit of influence have been normalised in our system. As a result, the conflicts of influence are more pronounced than they have ever been, but they are also harder to police and harder to disentangle, because they are so completely woven into the fabric of our lives.” Is the saga of the Sacklers is a quintessentially American tale, I wonder. He mulls this over for a long moment. “On one level, yes, because it illustrates the belief that many immigrants have that you can come to America, and in the space of one lifetime, completely transform the fortunes of your family, rise to the pinnacle of society and leave your mark on your new country. But it is also a story about corporate impunity and impunity for the super-rich. The whole last third of the book is about the bad guy getting away with it in the end. To me, that’s a story I could just as readily see taking place in London, as indeed it has – because many of the Sacklers are based there. You have to remember that OxyContin generated upwards of $35bn. That buys a level of influence that is hard to fathom.” Empire of Pain by Patrick Radden Keefe is published by Pan Macmillan (£9.99).

2/27/2022,"Ido wonder whether language itself is becoming redundant, given that so many people seem to converse solely in emojis or emoticons, or whatever the damned things are called. This thought was prompted by a news report headlined “Yats the way to do it as new craze updates your emojis”. Apparently, people, including Paris Hilton, are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on buying personalised emojis that best represent them online. One company, Yat Labs, in Nashville, has sold 160,000, netting a neat £14.9m in the past year. (Feel free to insert a thumbs-up symbol here if you so wish.) For me, it simply confirms the old saw that a fool and his money are soon parted. “Etna spews car-sized rocks”, said another headline last week. Experts say it is becoming “increasingly efficient”. What a nice way of putting it. I’d suggest that it’s about to blow a gasket or, as the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, might put it, albeit in another context, that it’s going “full tonto”.

2/27/2022,"At first glance, it looks like a neatly managed movie star career path: the graduation from teen-franchise heart-throb to a starring role in a superhero flick. But Robert Pattinson’s journey from Twilight – which made him, along with co-star and sometime girlfriend Kristen Stewart, one of the most famous people on the planet – to the latest incarnation of the nocturnal vigilante Bruce Wayne in The Batman, has been intriguingly circuitous. He took a decade-long detour through arthouse and auteur cinema, through offbeat roles – the freaks and weirdos, the feckless and the fundamentally untrustworthy – before he finally circled back, via scene-stealing supporting performances in The King and Tenet, into the kind of lead role which cements an actor’s A-list status. It could be viewed as a risky strategy, but it is one that paid off handsomely. Pattinson, who is now 35, has honed his mercurial talent. He is not just a movie star, he’s a thrillingly unpredictable and daring character actor. And he has nurtured something that is in short supply in his generation of groomed and polished media-savvy contemporaries: a refreshing oddball eccentricity. Pattinson found himself in a fortunate position of financial security post-Twilight – the widely held industry and audience assumption was that the safety net of Twilight earnings allowed him to pursue roles in the kind of films he watched by choice, working with the kind of directors that inspired him – such as David Cronenberg, Claire Denis, Robert Eggers and the Safdie brothers. However, in interviews which jangled with self doubt and an uncommon rawness, he sometimes claimed that the offers of big league roles just weren’t materialising and, having charted a course into arthouse waters, he had effectively removed himself from the A-list. This latter option seems unlikely – you don’t just stop being one of the most bankable stars on the planet, however many bonkers black and white seagull-slaughtering indie roles you take on (The Lighthouse) or onscreen prostate examinations you submit to (Cosmopolis). It’s worth mentioning at this point that the quirky and self-deprecating Pattinson is not the most reliable narrator of his own life. He went through a phase of spicing up interviews with fictional incidents: the story of witnessing an exploding clown car fatality during a traumatic childhood visit to the circus, for example. Or the time when he claimed that he spontaneously went for a meal with a stalker in Spain, and then scared her away by being such a miserable dinner companion. Pattinson’s fabrications are skewed towards the surreal and almost believable, self-contained short stories in miniature. It’s not for nothing that Eggers, who directed The Lighthouse, compares his oddball, deadpan sense of humour to that of the comedian Andy Kaufman. If not at the top of the A-list, he was certainly A-list adjacent, otherwise he wouldn’t have been cast in The Batman. “It is undeniable that he is a force to be reckoned with,” says Cindy Tolan, one of the casting directors of The Batman. “Robert is an incredible actor possessing extraordinary talent. From his films, The Rover, Cosmopolis and then the Safdie brothers’ Good Time, he possesses a smouldering, quiet subtlety and incredible technique.” But the actor we see in the bat-cowl has come a long way since he was everyone’s favourite undead dreamboat, with a pearlescent skin tone and, as Pattinson pointed out in an interview at the time, some major personal problems. “The more I read the script, the more I hated this guy, so that’s how I played him, as a manic-depressive who hates himself. Plus, he’s a 108-year-old virgin so he’s obviously got some issues there.” And his Twilight character Edward Cullen was not Pattinson’s only target. His post-Twilight career choices could be viewed as a series of counterstrikes against his movie star status and, in the case of Cronenberg’s acidic Hollywood satire Maps To The Stars, perhaps even against the movie industry itself. Other actors have had conflicted relationships with their own physical advantages – Brad Pitt, for example, prefers that the subject of his looks remains off limits in the dialogue of his films. But few have gone to war against their own beauty in the way that Pattinson did. His choices systematically dismantled his star appeal to reveal something rather more complex, intriguing and at times almost unsavoury. Pattinson is not afraid of embracing the more repellent aspects of his characters, or even his own persona. This, after all, is an actor who started (false) rumours about his own shampoo-dodging and questionable personal hygiene. Even so, he managed to secure a lucrative deal as the face of the Dior Homme scent. In Cosmopolis, the first of two collaborations with Cronenberg, his character, a billionaire asset manager, is vampiric in a way but far colder and crueller than Cullen ever was. In David Michôd’s post-apocalyptic thriller The Rover, playing a slow-witted outlaw, he’s concealed behind teeth that look as though they’ve been borrowed from a corpse, facial tics and a sluggish way of masticating his words like chewing tobacco. In Good Time, his crook on the run is slippery with panicked sweat and desperation. And in The Lighthouse, the entire gloriously deranged film looks as though it reeks of rotting herring, Pattinson’s character included. But perhaps the most revealing of his post-Twilight ventures was Fear & Shame, a three-minute comedy short film which Pattinson wrote and starred in, showing the actor besieged by photographers (“a gauntlet of trolls!”) and rubbernecking pedestrians as he attempts to get across NYC to satisfy his craving for a hotdog. It’s quirky, self-mocking and very dry in its humour. It also captures the isolated, disengaged quality that makes him such a great fit for outsider roles – of which the latest is Batman. Raised in Barnes in west London, allegedly expelled from one prep school for stealing and selling porn magazines to fellow students, and initially more interested in music as a career than in acting, Pattinson had already tasted a degree of attention following his performance as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Lucy Bevan, the other casting director on The Batman, recalls: “I first met Rob when he was 17 and still at school. He was shy but had impeccable manners and was intriguing. I was working for the late great Mary Selway at the time, and we cast him in his first film.” She adds: “He still has impeccable manners.” Even given the Potter connection, however, he was unprepared for the success of the Twilight films. The fame was of the variety that required escape strategies: Pattinson would switch cars and clothes to confuse the fans and the paparazzi. It was not something, he said at the time, to which he was particularly well suited. “I don’t think anyone can understand what’s happening. You wake up one day and you’re suddenly a star … really weird. “It’s a little bit over the top. All my life, I’ve hated crowds. I was quite a paranoid person anyway, so it doesn’t really feed well when people are looking at you. I’m not really in the right job. I don’t like having my photo taken. I don’t like the attention.” An actor who thrives on nervous energy, he harnessed that innate paranoia in films like Good Time and The Lighthouse. And it meant that he is well placed to tap into what he has described in interviews as a more socially maladroit “weirdo” quality in his version of Batman. “There’s a more nihilistic slant to it … it’s sort of implied that he’s had a bit of a breakdown,” he revealed to GQ. So what’s next for Pattinson? A return to Gotham is certainly a possibility, with Warner Bros rumoured to be considering a trilogy. But productions of this size are huge and time-consuming. What might be good news for comic-book movie fans is less so for indie cinema if it takes one of its most consistently intriguing and adventurous character actors out of circulation for several more years.",Arts/Film,Robert Pattinson: the heart-throb who dared to be repellent,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/27/robert-pattinson-the-heart-throb-who-dared-to-be-repellent
2/27/2022,"“We don’t mind a bit of banter from our rivals,” said Mark Dolan on GB News, about GB News, last weekend. “I like to think one of the great selling points of this place is that we have a sense of humour and we don’t take ourselves too seriously.” It certainly would be a selling point. We live in censorious times. “You wouldn’t say that about x!” proclaims y, apparently as offended by the pervasive sensitivity to x’s feelings as they are about any specific disparaging remark about themselves. So, in its mission to break away from the liberal metropolitan broadcasting consensus, GB News would be a refreshing presence if it could strike a tone of humorous self-deprecation, of taking a joke in good humour. That would genuinely be showing, not telling. Never mind moaning about the “culture wars”, start by putting your high horse out to pasture and assuming, like people generally do when they meet in real life, that no one is trying to be horrible. The trouble is, I have taken Dolan’s remark out of context in a way that has changed its meaning. This happens so much these days that I thought I’d have a go. Let me recontextualise it: he said it in the middle of recounting a bit of banter from one of GB News’s rivals that he really, really minded. The bit of banter in question came from Nick Robinson on Radio 4’s Today programme. He was interviewing Jerry Dyer, creator of the YouTube channel Big Jet TV, about the huge number of people who had watched it during Storm Eunice. “238,000 live viewers at one point,” said Dyer. Robinson replied: “They dream of that at GB News.” I think it’s witty. It’s not what you’d call a full-on gag because it’s also a statement of fact. I hear that GB News is improving in the ratings, but I suspect 238,000 would still be a very large number of live viewers for one of its programmes. Most channels other than the five old terrestrial ones would be pretty happy with it and sometimes even they have to settle for that sort of figure. So it’s a wry way of saying something true. And the subject is an organisation, not a person, so it’s not like a remark about someone’s appearance, which, as we all know, can often be both true and offensive. It’s more akin to reflecting that Tesco has a greater market share than Sainsbury’s. The funniest thing about Robinson’s quip, as I’m sure Dolan, a comedian himself, would accept, is the word “dream”. This evokes aspiration, it makes GB News’s aims emotional and hopeful. The thought of executives at a news channel dreaming about improved ratings is a heady mixture of poignant and daft – and therefore funny. Whether Dolan likes it or not, GB News has a comical image. It’s going to be used in jokes for a while because of the disastrous way it began. Andrew Neil’s flouncing off there after the BBC’s unwise decision to cancel his show was the perfect set-up for a pratfall. And the pratfall didn’t disappoint – in fact, it was a whole prat-sequence, like Buster Keaton falling down a staircase. It launched in June and was plagued with technical difficulties from the start, which, however blameless the reality, seemed amateurish and made one suspect those involved couldn’t work the cameras. Then Neil decided to take a break after less than a fortnight, a break that, as it turned out, never ended. Then there was an advertising boycott. Then there was a viewer boycott – this is about a month in – over Guto Harri taking the knee on air. This resulted in official viewer ratings of zero. That last is a very, very funny fact, particularly for a station involving Nigel Farage, who already seems like someone who, like a terrier tied up in a yard, yaps away whether or not anyone is listening. And finally, Neil’s behind the scenes wrangling culminated in his resignation as chairman in September. That’s the big bump at the bottom of the stairs. Things are looking up for GB News, but comic references change slowly and it’ll be in the same category as Ryanair customer service and Findus lasagne for a while. That is what Robinson was tapping into and, to the majority of listeners – those who aren’t struggling to make a go of GB News – it’s amusing. The huge issue for Dolan, though, is that Robinson is on the BBC. The fact that the remark was made by what Dolan calls “this BBC lifer” is, he reckons, “telling”. He’s characterising it as the established broadcasting institution punching down on a smaller rival, rather than Robinson merely saying something droll that occurred to him. In Dolan’s view, GB News is excused from having a sense of humour about the remark by the fact that it emanated from this contemptible source. He then segues from Robinson’s quip into a wide-ranging BBC slag-off: it’s anti-Brexit, pro-lockdown, it ruined Doctor Who and it scoffed at the union flag over breakfast. “These characters can laugh at us all they like,” he concedes generously, “but they don’t have to worry about ratings, ad revenue and fulfilling the expectations of investors because they have a plum job for life all financed by a public tax, the licence fee. Hardly a level playing field, is it?” There’s no route back to levity from there. This is such intense bitterness about the licence fee that you’d think it had been brought in since GB News launched, just to spite it. And what does he mean by “plum job for life”? Does he really think BBC broadcasters have a job for life? He should ask Andrew Neil. Dolan makes a job at the corporation sound so enviable, it’s impossible to believe he doesn’t want one himself. Somehow, at this torrid time for the BBC, he has contrived to make it sound invincible, while GB News shakes its fist on the sidelines, like Cliff Barnes railing against JR. Long may GB News fail to find its sense of humour because, as soon as it does, it’ll stop being so hilarious.",Opinion/Opinion,Why GB News is the new Findus lasagne | David Mitchell,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/27/why-gb-news-is-the-new-findus-lasagne
2/27/2022,"There’s no accounting for taste and if you need proof, acquire a three-year-old. Sometimes my son’s preferences amaze me in their quality. His recent delight at Aphex Twin’s Windowlicker stands as one of the highlights of my parenting life. But he is also, lamentably, a child, which means he sometimes enjoys things I can’t bring myself to compromise on. Friends who receive WhatsApp videos of him vibing to, say, Dutch electro may be surprised to learn that his actual tastes are closer to the DayGlo stylings of songs about apples and bananas, or startling morality tales concerning monkeys jumping on beds, frogs sitting on logs and so forth. They don’t need to know this, to know that I have failed, given up even. I allow and even encourage his own tentative steps toward forging his own cultural path. His favourites are mostly doggerel, of course, but I put up with it because I am a caring and supporting father who will withstand such terminal complacency since it’s wrong to yuck someone else’s yum – a lesson I learned from a particularly clever ladybird on another of his favourite TV shows. The alternative would be worse: sending him into school this September with an alienating discography of 90s techno in his head, while all his pals want to discuss the relative motion of bus wheels. What good is it for him to be artistically correct, as he pulls a sandwich from his In Our Time lunchbox, if it makes his friends think he’s weird? There is, however, one exception to this détente between us. I speak of a Netflix cartoon named Morphle, which has slowly destroyed my capacity for tolerance entirely. Morphle is a small, shapeshifting creature who can turn into anything wished by his friend (owner?) Mila. This he does in a series of episodes that are so gratuitously long and meandering I’m fairly sure some of them last a full fortnight. Every character looks like one of those off-brand toys you find in poundshops, with names like Transmorphers or Dinosaur Legend Power Men. Each has the odd, weightless texture of an inflatable, and every character moves through space with the uncanny spring of a bouncy castle in a strong wind. The animation of their movements is so repulsive, I can only compare its effect on me to food poisoning. And yet it delights him. It gives my son, my beautiful son, true and abundant pleasure. What kind of snob am I to deny him this? What kind of monster? ‘No’ I tell him when he asks for it, feeling my gorge rise at the thought of another 20 minutes stretched to six hours by its cultural poverty. He objects, but I hold firm. He will reject the next jungle mix I proffer out of spite, and maybe I’ll deserve it but, with all apologies to a certain clever ladybird, there are some yums which can absolutely get yucked.

2/27/2022,"Cat Burglar (Netflix)Suspicion (Apple TV+)The Fear Index (Sky Atlantic)We Are Black and British (BBC Two) | iPlayer You don’t expect to be dispatched to the existential abyss by an interactive cartoon. Watching/playing Netflix’s latest TV-gaming hybrid, Cat Burglar, a Looney Tunes homage from Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker, can take around 15 minutes or all eternity, depending on how old, slow and thick you are. While the quiz-type questions are easy, I appear to possess the lightning gaming reflexes of a stumbling carthorse. Jabbing pathetically at the TV remote, I keep answering too slowly and getting tossed back to the start, taking another of the myriad routes through the cartoon. Which doesn’t surprise me: I also struggled with Brooker’s 2018 Netflix interactive offering, the dark, convoluted Bandersnatch. Sorry, interactive TV, it’s not you, it’s me. The first outing since Brooker and Annabel Jones signed their new multi-kazillion Netflix deal, Cat Burglar is a classic cut of a cartoon in the Tex Avery/Chuck Jones/Hanna-Barbera tradition, which spawned Tom and Jerry, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and many more. Involving some of the team behind Netflix’s BoJack Horseman, the result is a period-piece animation curio with a modern gaming tweak. A cat called Rowdy (think: Top Cat with a dark side) must evade security guard Peanut (a canine Officer Dibble) to steal art from a museum. From there, it’s an evocative whirl around vintage cartoonery: eyes jut on stalks, telephone wires become tightropes, bras double as parachutes. When Rowdy dies, he glides up to heaven with angel wings and a halo. As we’ve established, interactive is not my bag. I’m: “My eyes are open, aren’t they? There’s your interaction right there.” Even so, more than Bandersnatch, Cat Burglar feels more game than television. Unlike The Simpsons’ Itchy and Scratchy, it’s not edgy, an ultra-violent bloodbath spoof; it doesn’t try to “say” anything. But it is exquisitely executed. The look, sound, colours, set pieces, music, tone et al are spot-on, capturing the artistry, imagination and surreal silliness of the gilded era of US animation. I might have the thumb skills of a decomposing corpse, but I recognise a labour of love when I see one. I wish Apple TV+’s eight-part thriller Suspicion were interactive: I could lob in a stick of cartoon dynamite and put it out of its misery. Originally an Israeli series, developed by Rob Williams, part-directed by Chris Long (The Americans), it starts with the abduction of the son of a prominent businesswoman in a plush New York hotel by kidnappers disguised in British royal family masks. Notably, there’s no Prince Andrew mask; presumably the kidnapper in that disguise was enjoying a pizza in Woking at the time of the abduction. Now four episodes in, Suspicion’s premise is that the kidnappers could be a group of random Britons: including an academic (Elizabeth Henstridge), a cybersecurity expert (Kunal Nayyar), a finance adviser (Georgina Campbell) and a ruthless mercenary (Elyes Gabel). Noah Emmerich and Angel Coulby portray the National Crime Agency/FBI agents hunting them, and at least they show up. Uma Thurman, playing the uber-alpha corporate mother of the abducted youth, and supposedly the “star” of Suspicion, barely features, especially in the opening episodes. Did her character have somewhere more important to be? Going by her distractingly drab styling – muddy-hued gowns skimming the floor – is this supposed to be an avant-garde production of The Crucible? Having watched the whole thing, Emmerich and Coulby manage to emerge with their acting dignity intact, despite being saddled with a “mismatched duo” cliche. Tom Rhys Harries is also good as an enigmatic student. Elsewhere, Suspicion is undone by erratic drama and nonsensical themes. The CCTV footage of the kidnapping goes viral, sparking a mass campaign for Thurman’s character to “tell the truth!”, but it’s not clear who wants her to. As the suspects endlessly trudge around, all sense of threat is lost, until, ruinously, it starts feeling like an overlong crime caper without jokes. In Sky Atlantic’s The Fear Index, a four-part adaptation of the 2011 Robert Harris novel, co-scripted by Harris, directed by David Caffrey, Josh Hartnett (The Virgin Suicides; Pearl Harbor) plays business genius Dr Alex Hoffman, who has developed an algorithm that detects fear in the stock market. After a series of disturbing events, including a violent break-in at his Geneva mansion, Hoffman wonders if he’s being set up. Essentially – spoiler alert – The Fear Index is one of those fables about humankind’s uneasy relationship with artificial intelligence, which authors from Kazuo Ishiguro to Ian McEwan love to sink their teeth into. Harris’s interpretation unfolds as a big stakes financial horror story, a FTSE 100-themed replay of Frankenstein’s monster, in which Hoffman’s sanity is called into question. Thematically, it feels somewhat dusty; certainly, it proves that it’s hard to visually convey the real or imagined threat of computers that even at their most ominous resemble gigantic petrol station cashpoints. However, Hartnett, a more versatile actor than he’s given credit for, commits to the writhing hyper-anxiety of a man who can’t trust anything or anyone, including himself, while Grégory Montel (Gabriel in Call My Agent!) steals scenes as a Columbo-like detective. This is a solid prestige production that knows how to work the smoke and mirrors. I’m not sure what I expected from the BBC Two two-part discussion documentary We Are Black and British, produced by Becky Clarke; probably a debate on the shared Black experience with everybody agreeing on important points – racism, schools, police, “white skin privileges”, sexuality. But, wow, was I wrong. Holed up in the Cotswolds, the participants were an articulate, disparate group. Dominique, who doesn’t think that racism is the answer to every problem; Kehinde, a radical university professor; Mista Strange, a gay rapper; Michelle, whose son was subjected to an unjust police stop and search; Raphael, who feels pressure to date within his race; and Lin, whose mixed-race heritage resulted in racism from family members. My sole criticism is the age range: where are the seniors? Otherwise, these are lively, passionate programmes, where everyone has something to say and questions to pose, while giving one another the space to respectfully disagree. Westminster, take note.

2/27/2022,"One of the lasting legacies of this pandemic is that almost half-a-million workers are missing from the labour market. This increase in inactivity – people neither working nor looking for work – is why our employment rate has not recovered, despite unemployment returning to pre-pandemic levels. Early in the pandemic, it was young people dropping out of the labour market. But that was often for good reasons, such as to study, and they’ve returned since. The real, lasting story, however, is about older workers. Even as the economy reopened and vacancies hit record level, those aged over 50 have been dropping out of the labour force. Why? New research investigated the idea that the pandemic might have made us more materialistic because lockdowns gave us lots of what is correlated with materialism: media consumption and loneliness. But it concludes the opposite has happened: we’re placing less importance on money. The authors argue that this might be linked to falls in labour market participation: less wish for money equals less need for work. Maybe. Survey data indicates early retirements are partly what is happening, which for those who can afford it shouldn’t concern us. But the bigger driver of rising inactivity is a surge in long-term ill health, which matters to all of us. It means lower living standards for those retiring and a smaller economy for everyone. And history tells us when older workers leave work for any length of time they are unlikely to return. For some, the falls in labour market participation may be driven by pandemic silver linings as people reassess their lives or values, but for many the last thing dropping out of work may feel like is a choice.",Opinion/Opinion,Pandemic-driven early retirement isn’t a silver lining when it’s because of ill health | Torsten Bell,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/27/pandemic-driven-early-retirement-isnt-silver-lining-ill-health
2/27/2022,"Peter Hennessy is Attlee professor of contemporary British history at Queen Mary University of London. He is a fellow of the British Academy and was made a crossbench life peer in 2010. The author of a widely admired “postwar trilogy” of history books, his latest work is A Duty of Care: Britain Before and After Covid. It combines deep knowledge of the UK’s political landscape over the past 80 years with a “new Beveridge” manifesto to create a fresh vision of the welfare state. Your new book’s title is A Duty of Care. Can you define in brief terms what you mean by that phrase?Well, the state in modern times has always had a duty of care of some sort for the people. After the second world war, it took on permanent duties of care with the welfare state. But in the pandemic an intense extension of the duty of care took place. So our awareness of what the state might have to do for us and with us, with parliament’s sanction, has increased very considerably. It was a collective experience that made me wonder whether the maps in our mind would permanently change, because the rattling of the pots and pans for the NHS was a wonderful experience. And it sounded to me like the sound of a people rediscovering themselves. You kept a diary to write the book. Is that unusual for you and did you do it every day?I thought that as a professional historian I should do something I’ve never done before, which is write a daily diary as an antidote to the time when I would write it up as a piece of finished history. There’s a terrible temptation for historians to tidy up excessively after the event. I’d scarcely finished the first page and the World at One producer rang and asked me to talk about the historic significance of what I thought might be coming. I then made the case that henceforth postwar British history will be divided into BC, Before Corona, and AC, After Corona. And I’ve written a diary every day since then. It’s an aid to humility, which I think every historian needs – certainly this historian does. How did the period of lockdowns affect you?Mercifully, my wife and I were Covid-free. I’m in the shielding category, because of a couple of things. But also, without realising it, I’d been rehearsing for it. I had a slipped disc from the summer of 2019, so I’d been at home anyway, very rarely getting into the House of Lords. We were both very fortunate because we had each other, we’re not short of money and we’re both the sort of people who can keep our interest going through thick and thin. We were as fortunate as anybody could be during a terrible time for everybody. You quote Nigel Lawson saying that the NHS is the closest thing we have to a religion. But to improve its performance, does it need an overhaul or just greater investment?It needs both. In our long history, the NHS is the closest we’ve come to institutionalising altruism. That’s why it has a special place in people’s hearts. I admire Nigel and regard him as a friend, but I must say if you’re going to turn anything into a secular religion, it might as well be the NHS… there are certainly a lot worse candidates. The potential fragility of the intensive care systems in this wretched pandemic was what was surprising. The people who staff it did surpassing wonders, but they are still worn out by it. So it survived the test but it needs long and sustained investment, plus an overhaul. You also quote RH Tawney, who said that the mark of civilisation was to aim to eliminate inequalities. Can we move towards a more egalitarian future with a monarchy?I think we can. For one practical reason – replacing the monarch with a republic will be hugely fractious for this country. All the royal prerogatives on which government operates would have to be rewritten. It would be an enormous task. And the monarchy, particularly because of the current monarch, is hugely popular. I’d also say that she’s been a remarkable asset in the story I’ve been telling in the postwar history books [Never Again, Having it So Good and Winds of Change] because she’s been the queen of the postwar settlement. She’s visited more hospitals and opened more things that were part of that settlement without ever being political about it. She’s been central to the extended notion of welfare. I’ve devoted a large part of my life to looking at the British constitution and she’s the only part that’s lived up to specifications. Who are the historians you most enjoy reading?Occasionally, I dip back into the works of JK Galbraith – he was an economic historian, among many other things – just because they’re so brilliantly written. I also revisit Keynes’s essays in biography, because they are stellar in every way. I also like rereading Tawney, not just because he was an economic historian of great brilliance, but also because he was a wonderful human being and a hero of mine. Just above my computer there’s a picture of him in his study, in brown tweeds of a thickness you can’t imagine, smoking a pipe and writing a draft of an economic history article! As a constitutional expert, do you think “partygate” is a storm in a teacup or a fundamental breach of the contract between government and citizens?I think it’s something fundamental. The North Shropshire byelection showed that we are still shockable as a people. We don’t just shrug our shoulders and say, well, that’s the way things are. Our system rests on decencies and without them it doesn’t work. I don’t want to join this long and constantly growing queue to slag off the prime minister, but I’ve watched prime ministers for a long time now. Just as my great political hero, Clement Attlee, was the incarnation of the modesty premiership, this one stands out as the vanity premiership. The great project is himself. I hope we don’t have another one like that for a very long time indeed. A Duty of Care: Britain Before and After Covid by Peter Hennessy is published by Penguin (£20).
