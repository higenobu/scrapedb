1/18/2022,"⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious According to a Facebook post made by Texarkana Texas Police Department, a woman who ran from cops absolutely destroyed the Chevy Camaro she was driving. Like we’re talking the muscle car is probably a salvage at this point and she didn’t even crash it… much. Stories like this makes us wonder if these criminals just really hate their car or are sadistic or just plain evil or something – we’re traumatized. To understand why, read on, but you might want some tissues handy. Learn about the shocking murder of Mickey Thompson here. Everything went down on the night of January 11 when an officer spotted an orange Camaro with black stripes backed into a parking stall in front of the Magnuson Hotel. The officer remembered that Chelsea Davis was known to drive just such a car and that she had a felony forgery warrant, so he pulled his vehicle in front of the Chevy, trapping it in the spot. After getting out he realized not only that Davis was in the driver’s seat but that the engine was running. Now, cops get nervous if you don’t shut off your car when they approach. Raising the tension further was the fact Davis locked the doors and refused to get out. That’s when the officer told her what she probably already knew: she would be going to jail that night. We’re guessing Davis thought she knew something the officer didn’t, that she was going to get away. But that cop was thinking two steps ahead of her. When she asked to call her dad the officer agreed and walked off, going back to his car, getting out a spike strip, and positioning it in the parking lot by his vehicle. That’s pretty tricky. Sure enough, Davis rammed the cop’s car with the Camaro, using its portly nature to push out of the blockade. But she also ran right over the spike strip, immediately pancaking three of her tires. Nevertheless, she persisted. Taking surface streets, the fourth tire gave out and that’s when Davis got the empowering idea to get on Interstate 30, because that’s what you should do when driving on alloy wheels and quickly deteriorating rubber compound. Thinking she was Steve McQueen, maybe because she listens to Sheryl Crow too much (which would be at all), Davis pushed the poor Camaro to almost 100 mph. Now, a sane person would know they’re caught and driving like this is incredibly dangerous, but being a faithful Sheryl Crow fan she wasn’t about to let the system beat her. Nevertheless, she persisted. Reaching the Nash exit, Davis was far from done but the Camaro wasn’t. As the Texarkana Texas Police Department said, it “just couldn’t go any further.” In other words, the Chevy wasn’t moving forward anymore. Nevertheless, she persisted. When officers caught up to Davis, she was sitting in the Camaro on the side of the Interstate, her foot planted firmly on the accelerator as the wheels spun uselessly. After breaking the glass, pulling the woman out of the car as she tried fighting them, then finally arresting her, we bet the cops laughed and laughed because who does that? Talk about not knowing when to give up! For all her effort and persisting, Davis performed the magic trick of converting a felony forgery warrant into that plus charges for evading arrest with a vehicle and resisting arrest. She should also be charged for wantonly desecrating a Camaro. Someone get us in touch with the Texas legislature, we have an idea for a new law. Sign up for the Motorious Newsletter.

1/18/2022,"(Adds quotes) LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Britain said on Monday it was supplying Ukraine with anti-tank weapons to help it defend itself from a potential invasion, during a stand-off with Russia which has massed troops near the Ukrainian border. Western countries say they fear Russia is preparing a pretext for a new assault on Ukraine, which it invaded in 2014. Moscow denies any plans for an attack, but has said it could take unspecified military action unless the West agrees to a list of demands, including banning Ukraine from ever joining NATO. Talks last week ended with no breakthrough. Kyiv has asked Western countries for arms to help it protect itself. ""We have taken the decision to supply Ukraine with light anti-armour defensive weapon systems,"" British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told parliament, saying the first systems were already delivered on Monday and a small number of British personnel would provide training for a short period of time. He did not specify the number or type of weapons that were being sent, but said: ""They are not strategic weapons and pose no threat to Russia. They are to use in self-defence."" ""These are short-range .... but nevertheless it would make people pause and think what they were doing and if tanks were to roll into Ukraine, invade it, then they would be part of the defence mechanism."" Wallace said he had invited Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to visit London in the next few weeks to discuss the crisis, though he did not know whether the Russians would accept. ""The current gap is wide but not unbridgeable. I still remain hopefully that diplomacy will prevail. It is President (Vladimir) Putin’s choice,"" Wallace said.

1/18/2022,"The roof of a college dormitory in Western North Carolina partially collapsed on Sunday, Jan. 16, as heavy snowfall battered the region — which school officials said was likely to blame. Several dozen students were in the building at the time, according to reports, but no one was hurt. The incident occurred around 3:15 p.m. at Brevard College on the eastern side of Jones Hall, school administrators said in a Facebook post. Jones is one of five residence halls on the campus, which sits in Transylvania County about 35 miles outside of Asheville. “Jones Hall Residents Advisors responded immediately and all students were safely evacuated and accounted for, with no injuries reported,” the school said. Officials attributed the collapse to “heavy snowfall weather conditions.” At least 10 inches of snow had fallen in Brevard by 8:30 a.m. on Jan. 16, meteorologist Jim Cantore tweeted. Cantore is famous for going to places with the worst weather conditions. 10.0"" Snow
Brevard, NC pic.twitter.com/02q6Fj4m4e — Jim Cantore (@JimCantore) January 16, 2022 When the roof collapsed, Brevard Fire Department spokesperson Adam Hughey told The Transylvania Times 50 students were in the dorm, which houses about 84 students during the school year. Jonathan Griffith, a first-year student, was on the porch of the dormitory about to have a snowball fight with friends when it happened, according to the newspaper. He took off running and immediately thought about everything that got left inside — including his cellphone. “It was like something straight out of a movie,” Griffith told The Transylvania Times. “I just saw stuff start flying. I heard a rumbling noise. It was loud, and I was out of there. I hit my 40-yard-dash, and probably ran a 4.5” Sophomore Melody Ferguson said she saw the roof collapse as she was walking by Jones Hall, WLOS reported. She told the media outlet that friends who were across campus thought it was a car crash. “Very scary,” Ferguson said, according to WLOS. “I’m still shaking to this moment.” Someone pulled the fire alarm after the roof caved in, allowing everyone to get out quickly, WLOS reported. Parents Dwayne and Christy Yancy shared a picture of the building on Facebook that their son sent, saying his room is directly below the section of roof that caved in and that he evacuated with just “the clothes on his back.” “We’re relieved that all the students are safe and that they’re all in warm places for the night,” they said. “Stuff can be replaced but I feel like all his things are ok. It’s a pretty helpless feeling to not be able to rush up there to him.” The Yancys said their son was told he could return to his room briefly on Monday, Jan. 17, to grab any necessary items. Each floor of Jones Hall is separated by concrete to prevent the ceiling on lower levels from also caving in, The Transylvania Times reported, citing Hughey and Brevard Police Chief Bobby Cooper. Hughey and Cooper said some rooms, however, might have water damage from the collapse. Brevard College officials said students have been placed in temporary accommodations while a building inspector and emergency response crews assess the building.

Footage captured by Jacinta Shackleton, posted to her Instagram account on January 6, shows the elusive sea creature twisting and turning beneath the waves. “Today I had such an incredible snorkel and came across a blanket octopus,” Shacklton wrote alongside the clip. “These animals are a rarely encountered pelagic octopus species that spend their whole lifecycle in the open ocean.” “The first live male was only sighted in 2002,” she added.
