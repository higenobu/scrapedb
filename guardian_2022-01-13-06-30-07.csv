1/13/2022,"Federal health authorities in America have said the Omicron Covid-19 variant is so contagious it is likely most people in the US will be infected, and compared the pandemic to a “natural disaster”.  Authorities said even as Omicron shatters records for new cases, they are hopeful the surge will quickly subside, and said the US needs to focus on ensuring hospital systems do not collapse amid the surge. “I think it’s hard to process what’s actually happening right now, which is [that] most people are going to get Covid, all right?” said Janet Woodcock, the acting head of the Food and Drug Administration. “What we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function … [that] transportation, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens.” Woodcock made the comments at a Senate hearing where senators, especially Republicans, harshly questioned administration officials tasked with responding to the pandemic, including Woodcock, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Rochelle Walensky, and the president’s chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci. With several major mutations, the Omicron variant has spread rapidly around the globe and shattered records for new daily cases in the US. The CDC reports that the variant is now responsible for more than 98% of Covid-19 cases in the US, replacing Delta in less than a month. At the same time, the variant is believed to be less lethal than previous strains and there is some evidence it may quickly peak. However, even as Omicron sends fewer patients to the hospital as a proportion of total cases, the deluge of cases has put hospitals, schools and businesses under strain – filling up beds, causing staff shortages and prompting a return to remote activities. An average of more than 761,000 Americans a day tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday, the day of the hearing, according to the New York Times. Even this tally is known to be a vast undercount, because few people report the positive results of at-home rapid tests to health authorities. On the same day the previous year, also the peak of a winter surge, an average of 251,232 people tested positive for Covid-19. Even as Omicron stresses essential systems, severe illness is not inevitable, and health authorities stressed the importance of vaccination to reduce the likelihood of severe illness. The CDC is also considering a recommendation for Americans to wear N95 and KN95 masks, rather than cloth ones, if possible. Fauci later echoed Woodcock’s comments, that most Americans are likely to be infected with the variant, at the Centers for Strategic and International Studies, a thinktank in Washington. He added that comparatively few vaccinated and boosted Americans will face hospitalization and death. “Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody,” Fauci told J Stephen Morrison, senior vice-president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, CNN reported. “Those who have been vaccinated … and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death,” he said. People who have not been vaccinated are far more likely to, “get the brunt of the severe aspect of this”.",News/World news,"Omicron so contagious most Americans will get Covid, top US health officials say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/omicron-covid-contagious-janet-woodcock-fauci
1/13/2022,"The American opera singer Maria Ewing, who has died aged 71, excited both acclaim and controversy for her seductive portrayals and frequently idiosyncratic vocal delivery. Much of her early career was made in the US, initially under the mentorship of the Metropolitan Opera’s music director James Levine, though British audiences will recall more readily the vivid performances she gave of several roles, most notably Rosina (The Barber of Seville), Carmen and Poppea (Monteverdi’s L’Incoronazione di Poppea), the last two directed by Sir Peter Hall, whom she married in 1982.  At her finest, she was a singing actor of the highest calibre, with a richly textured voice capable of remarkable things and a mesmerising stage presence. Inevitably she will be best remembered for the Dance of the Seven Veils she enacted in Hall’s 1986 production of Strauss’s Salome, in which, as the original dancer if not the composer intended, she removed every last garment, in a performance of smouldering intensity and power. Inhabiting John Bury’s Klimt-inspired sets with her flapper headband and kohl-rimmed eyes – her mobile features were one of her greatest assets – she was the incarnation of the debauched princess. It may not have been the most penetrating voice to confront Strauss’s orchestral battery, but the sheer range of vocalisation, from the opulent top to a growly bottom, combined with acting of alarming immediacy, confirmed her assumption of the role as one of the finest in the work’s history. Where, in Salome, her deployment of a technique touching on notes rather than hitting them foursquare not inappropriately anticipated the Sprechstimme mode (a hybrid of singing and speech) called for by Schoenberg just a few years later in Pierrot Lunaire, a similar penchant for cabarettish looseness in her vocalisation sometimes attracted less sympathetic critical notice, especially in her singing of such roles as Carmen and Tosca. In the former, sung under Hall’s direction at Glyndebourne (1985), she gave a compelling portrayal that resembled less a sex-kitten than a purring tigress. Some found it too contrived, others complained that the vocalism reminded them of the French singer Edith Piaf, but there was no denying that she dominated the stage. In fairness it should be noted that the “night-club inflections” observed on the first night of the 1987 revival were toned down during the run. The following year Ewing offered Glyndebourne audiences another seductive but forceful characterisation in the form of Poppea, by turns wheedling and haughty. Here the opulence of the voice matched the regality of her portrayal and indeed its strongly sensual component. The other Glyndebourne production of note was that of The Barber of Seville in John Cox’s staging of 1981. Though it preceded her work with Hall, Ewing demonstrated that she was already an accomplished actor, with instinctive comic timing and a display of wide-eyed charm and ebullience. She may have started her career specialising in Mozartian and lyric mezzo roles, but by this time the voice had developed in size and range. That was evident too in the revival in the same year of Cox’s Ariadne auf Naxos, where she also brought such passion to the role of the Composer that the vocal line in places threatened to fragment. Ewing was born in Detroit, Michigan, the youngest of four daughters of a Dutch mother, Hermina (nee Veraar), and an African-American father, Norman, who worked as an engineer. After study at the Cleveland Institute (1968-70) with Eleanor Steber, and in later years with Jennie Tourel and O Marzolla, Ewing made her debut at the Ravinia festival in 1973. She then appeared in Miami, Boston, Cologne, Chicago and Santa Fe, before making her Salzburg debut in 1976 in the role of Cherubino in Le Nozze di Figaro. Her Metropolitan debut followed in the same year and in the same role. Other roles she took subsequently at the Met included Rosina, Mélisande, Blanche (Poulenc’s Dialogues des Carmélites), Zerlina, Dorabella, the Composer and Carmen. The role of Debussy’s Mélisande, in which she made her European debut, at La Scala, was one she took exceptionally well, perhaps because of its parlando-style vocalism. A recording under Claudio Abbado of the same composer’s cantata La Damoiselle élue, based on a text by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, demonstrates an equal mastery of the idiom in the tender but animated intimacy with which the line is floated. Here her signature permissiveness on matters of notation was fruitfully applied, with unobtrusive portamenti registering as the lamenting sighs of Rossetti’s Blessed Damozel. In the title role of Rossini’s Cenerentola she was able to deploy her innate charm to a quite different effect from that displayed as Carmen or Poppea. Here she won sympathy with her depiction of a modest cinder girl, negotiating the taxing decoration with both precision and sensitivity to feeling. Concern had been raised in some critical quarters from an early stage as to the advisability of Ewing, as a mezzo-turned-soprano, throwing herself at heavier roles, not least those of Puccini heroines, with apparent disregard for any deleterious effect on her voice. By the 1990s these chickens had finally come home to roost. Her Butterfly in the production by Ian Judge for Los Angeles Opera (1991) may have challenged certain preconceptions about the role – this was not the fluttery geisha girl of usual convention – but palpable breaks between registers and defective high notes were recorded alongside, in safer areas of the vocal range, exquisite pianissimos and extremely potent forte outbursts. Likewise in a 1993 revival of a San Francisco Tosca, her singing of the title role featured vivid colouring of the text and a poignant “Vissi d’arte”, but disquiet was expressed about its generally uneven quality. A 1993 appearance as Salome in San Francisco failed to re-enact the triumph of the original production, though it had been given, with some success, in London, Chicago and Washington in the intervening years. By 1997 her voice was, by some accounts, as heard in a Fedora in Los Angeles, in virtual shreds. Her career drawing to a close, she gave a recital in 2004 at St John’s Smith Square and in 2008 rekindled old fires, making a glamorous appearance bejewelled as the Queen of the Fairies in an Iolanthe for the Carl Rosa Opera at the Gielgud theatre, London. Ewing and Hall divorced in 1990. She is survived by their daughter, Rebecca, the actor and director.

1/13/2022,"Kanye West, Billie Eilish and Harry Styles are expected to headline the 21st Coachella music festival in April, Variety reported on Wednesday ahead of the festival’s official full lineup announcement, which is expected later this week. The trio will also be joined by Swedish House Mafia, though it is unclear whether the house music supergroup will also headline. North America’s largest music festival, which has already sold out, is scheduled to take place on the weekends of 15-17 April and 22-24 April at its usual haunt, the Empire Polo Ground in Indio, California, east of Los Angeles.  However, due to the spread of Covid’s Omicron variant, which has indefinitely postponed the Grammy Awards set for 31 January and shut down a host of Broadway shows, it remains to be seen whether an event boasting 125,000 per-day tickets, will proceed or be rescheduled for a fifth time. The music festival was originally set for April 2020 with headliners Travis Scott, Frank Ocean and Rage Against the Machine, before the Covid-19 pandemic forced organizers to reschedule to October 2020, then April 2021, then October of that year before bumping again to this April. Ocean already postponed his performance until 2023, and Scott was removed from the bill after the Astroworld concert tragedy in November 2021, in which overcrowding at the Houston festival led to the asphyxiation of 10 people. It will be Styles’s first Coachella performance, a few months after wrapping the largest North American music tour since the start of the pandemic in support of his 2019 album Fine Line. Eilish, who would become Coachella’s youngest-ever headliner, had a breakout performance at the festival in 2019, a scene captured in her 2021 documentary The World’s a Little Blurry.

1/13/2022,"Boris Johnson’s premiership was hanging in the balance as Conservative MPs began openly calling for his resignation after he admitted attending a garden party in lockdown, claiming he thought it was a “work event”. Johnson delivered a carefully worded apology for attending the alcohol-fuelled gathering of up to 40 officials in May 2020, which was described in an email invitation as “socially distanced drinks” to enjoy the warm weather.  Some cabinet ministers later tweeted their qualified support for the prime minister – though the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was noticeable by his silence and absence from the frontbench as Johnson offered his account during prime minister’s questions. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, said Johnson had been “right to personally apologise” because people were “hurt and angry at what happened”. She said it was now right to await the findings of senior civil servant Sue Gray’s inquiry into Downing Street gatherings. The findings could come as soon as the end of next week but more likely the week after, a cabinet source suggested. One former minister was even less convinced, saying Johnson “didn’t apologise for what he did but for things that may or may not have happened which he officially knows nothing about until Sue Gray tells him about it”. Another MP said: “I’ve not seen such a half-arsed apology since my child apologised for spilling all the milk.” One frontbencher said: “There’s a sense of relief that he made the apology but there’s a sense of anticipation about the report and whether the police get involved. We are in purgatory.” Saying he had “been on a visit all day”, Sunak later took to Twitter to say Johnson was “right to apologise and I support his request for patience while Sue Gray carries out her enquiry”. In the aftermath of Johnson’s statement, one of the Conservatives’ most senior backbenchers, William Wragg, and Douglas Ross, the leader of the party in Scotland, publicly called for Johnson to resign, saying his position had become untenable. Some MPs were openly discussing sending letters to the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, demanding a vote of no confidence in Johnson. Brady will not reveal how many letters he has received until the threshold for the vote of 54 is reached, but one former minister suggested that based on conversations with colleagues, the number may currently be about 25. MPs were also irritated by the prime minister appearing less contrite in private conversations after his Commons appearance than he had been in public. However, others suggested they would wait to see Gray’s findings. The aftermath of local elections in May was also suggested as a possible moment for a no-confidence vote to be triggered. In the House of Commons, Johnson accepted for the first time that he had been at the 20 May 2020 gathering and that this was a mistake, while also attempting to defend his actions. Saying the No 10 garden was at the time routinely used as “an extension of the office”, Johnson argued that he had believed the event was a work gathering, prompting derisive laughter from opposition MPs and mockery across social media. The event itself, he added, “could be said, technically, to fall within the guidance”. In response, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, called for Johnson to “do the decent thing and resign”, castigating the prime minister as “a man without shame” and someone the British public widely viewed as a liar. Johnson’s performance brought muted cheers from Tory benches but any hopes inside No 10 that a reckoning had been successfully delayed until after Gray’s report were dashed when Ross became the first senior MP to call for the prime minister to resign. The leader of the Scottish Tories said he had previously argued Johnson’s position would be untenable if it was found he had been at the party, and that this had happened. Ross said: “I don’t want to be in this position, but … I don’t think he can continue as leader of the Conservatives.” He later confirmed that he had submitted a letter calling for a no-confidence vote. The levelling-up secretary, Michael Gove, later ridiculed Ross’s stance, telling MPs at the powerful 1922 Committee that “my instant response is he’s in Elgin and the national Tory leader is in London”. Gove launched a staunch defence of Johnson, saying he had made the right decisions, including on Covid restrictions. But Wragg, the vice-chair of the committee that represents Tory backbenchers, said colleagues were “frankly worn out from defending what is invariably indefensible”. “For their sakes at least, the prime minister should see that and do the right thing,” he told the BBC, saying the resignation should come soon. The “constant distraction” of stories was damaging the government and party, Wragg said, adding: “As colleagues are saying to one another on and off the record, I sadly think that the prime minister’s position is untenable.” One Tory adviser said they didn’t think “No 10 understands how much danger they are in” and predicted the prime minister had 72 hours to turn things around, with a lot of “noise” from furious MPs expected in the next couple of days. “At the moment, it is clear they haven’t done enough to turn this around. He could do more with the apology and taking responsibility, more fulsomely,” they said, while also highlighting the need for an overhaul of the No 10 operation. Downing Street has said it would expect Gray’s inquiry to be paused if the Metropolitan police decide to launch their own investigation into alleged breaches of coronavirus regulations committed when the parties were held. On Wednesday night, however, the Met seemed set to wait until Gray’s inquiry is complete before making a decision on whether they will investigate or not. Any breach of coronavirus laws is punishable by a fine, and police have up to three years to investigate. On Wednesday Johnson’s press secretary declined to answer any further questions about the party, such as whether Johnson’s then fiancee, Carrie, attended, as witnesses attest. She repeatedly insisted: “Those matters will rightly remain for the independent review to look at and determine.” She said Johnson had not seen the email invitation sent by his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds.
