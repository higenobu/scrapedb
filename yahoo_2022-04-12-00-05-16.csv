4/12/2022,"The Baby Boomer generation is reaching retirement age in record numbers. With more Boomers retiring on a daily basis, it helps to understand how prepared they are to leave their jobs for good. In this article, we'll discuss the average retirement savings for Baby Boomers, and provide tips for how to boost retirement income. Regardless of which generation you belong to, a financial advisor can help you get ready for retirement. Average Retirement Savings for Baby Boomers According to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, the estimated median retirement savings for Baby Boomer is $202,000. Based on the 4% Rule, this would yield an annual retirement income of $8,000 per year. Depending on your perspective, this portfolio size could be more or less than you expected. Transamerica also found that about 45% of Baby Boomers have saved $250,000 or more. Further, 40% of Boomers agree with the statement that they have not done enough to save for retirement. A study by the Stanford Center on Longevity found that people born from 1948 to 1953 had a median balance in tax-advantaged plans of $290,000, while those born from 1954 to 1959 had a median balance of $209,246 in their tax-advantaged plans. One item that puts this in perspective is that the Boomer generation was the last to have widespread access to workplace pensions. With expected retirement income from pensions, many Boomers didn't feel the need to save as much as succeeding generations. Additionally, for Boomers who are still working, this number should continue to rise as they make additional annual contributions and their investments grow. If you use the Rule of 72, the youngest Boomers could expect to have one last ""doubling"" of their retirement nest egg with average returns of 8% to 10% before they reach 67. How Baby Boomers Can Increase Retirement Income Retirement income is an important topic for people close to retirement age. These steps are simple ways to boost the average savings retirement savings for Boomers. For each strategy that you are able to implement, you'll increase your potential retirement income. Maximize Retirement Plans By contributing the maximum every year to your retirement plans, you'll create a larger nest egg to withdraw from in retirement. Additionally, if you contribute to pretax retirement plans (like a 401(k), 403(b), or 457 Plan), you'll reduce your tax bill every year providing extra money to invest. For 2022 you are allowed to contribute up to $20,500 in these plans. Conversely, by contributing to post-tax retirement plans like a Roth IRA, you're creating tax-free income in retirement. These plans do not have required minimum distributions starting at age 72, so this tax-free money can continue to grow for many years. You can add up to $6,000 per year (2022 annual limit) to your Roth IRA, depending on your income. Catch-up Contributions For Savers Over 50 When you reach age 50, you're allowed to make ""catch up"" contributions to your retirement accounts. This means that you can add an additional $6,500 to your company retirement plans and another $1,000 to your IRA (Traditional or Roth). These catch-up provisions help you boost your retirement savings in the final years before retirement. The more you are able to put away, the larger your nest egg will grow and produce monthly income in retirement. Use a Brokerage Account When you've maxed out your retirement savings, investing through a brokerage account is a good idea. There are no contribution limits or withdrawal rules to worry about. While most retirement plans have limited choices, you have infinitely more investment options to choose from in a brokerage account. Brokerage accounts can also help with your tax planning strategies since you can pick and choose which assets to sell. For example, you can benefit from capital losses that offset an unlimited amount of capital gains and up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year. And when you sell winning investments after holding them for longer than one year, those profits are taxed at lower capital gains rates. Use a Health Savings Account A health savings account offers triple tax benefits. Your contributions are tax-deductible each year when paired with a high-deductible health insurance plan. The money grows tax-deferred while it is inside the account. And your withdrawals are tax-free when used for eligible medical expenses, including Medicare premiums. Plus, there are no required minimum distribution requirements so the money can continue to grow and cover future medical expenses in retirement. Purchase an Annuity Annuities are another investment option that provides tax-deferred growth for your investments. These insurance products provide returns that mimic a variety of assets, including fixed income and the stock market. Equity-index annuities offer the best of both worlds. It offers guarantees similar to fixed income, but the potential to earn more with participation in the stock market. When you need retirement income, you can withdraw as needed or annuitize your balance for guaranteed income like a pension. The monthly annuity payments are a combination of principal and interest. Your principal is returned tax-free. However, you must report all interest on your tax returns. Cash-Value Life Insurance Buying a cash-value life insurance policy allows you to purchase a death benefit to protect your loved ones with the ability to invest additional cash. As your cash balance increases, it has the potential to increase your death benefit for your beneficiaries. Additionally, you may be able to withdraw the cash tax-free when taken as a loan. When you pass away, the unpaid balance is deducted from your death benefit. Delay Taking Social Security The full retirement age for people born between 1943 and 1954 is 66. And everyone born after that, it is age 67. For every year that you delay taking Social Security, your monthly benefit increases by 8%. While it can be tempting to take the guaranteed money today by starting Social Security early, waiting can be very lucrative. If you are able to until 70, you're guaranteeing a 32% increase in the monthly benefit. This extra income is yours for the rest of your life. This extra money also impacts anyone getting survivor benefits. For people who have a long life expectancy, this additional money really adds up. Baby Boomers, Defined The Baby Boomer generation is the nickname given to people born between 1946 and 1964. This generation covers more than 20 years of births and most people assume that it's a homogenous group of people. However, there is actually quite a lot of variety in the ages, personalities, experiences, and goals for Boomers. Common thinking is that you've reached retirement age when you turn 65 years old. However, that isn't always the case. Social Security considers age 66 full retirement for people born between 1943 and 1954, and age 67 for everyone born after that. Plus, modern advances in medicine and nutrition help people live longer and enjoy healthier lives well beyond conventional thinking. For example, the last two U.S. presidents and numerous members of Congress, the Supreme Court, and CEOs of major corporations are all over the age of 65. The first Boomers born in 1946 reached 66 in 2012, yet the last Boomers won't hit full retirement age until 2031. Many Boomers continue to work because they enjoy the challenge, while some have to because they didn't save enough. Others retire based on the growth of their net worth thanks to all-time highs in the stock market and housing values. The Bottom Line The average retirement savings for Baby Boomers is just over $200,000. Since the last Boomers won't retire until 2031, there is still plenty of time to boost their retirement savings. By contributing to retirement plans and using other accounts, they can use their peak earning years to sock away additional money. This enables market returns and ongoing contributions to maximize their nest egg and the income that it produces.

4/12/2022,"Elon Musk will no longer join Twitter’s board American owner set to lose billions on Boots sale FTSE 100 falls 0.5pc after February GDP disappoints Oil prices slump amid China lockdowns Lucy Burton: It’s too late for Hong Kong to regain expats’ trust Sign up here for our daily business briefing newsletter Russian Railways has been ruled in default on a bond after missing an interest payment last month in the latest sign that western sanctions are hammering Moscow. The decision by the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee comes after the state-owned company failed to make a payment to investors and a 10-day grace period expired. Contracts insuring the company’s debt against default will be triggered, and holders will now wait to see how much will be paid. The move, which is the first time a Russian debt instrument has been officially classified as defaulted since the invasion began, could set a precedent for other companies and even the government. Scrutiny is growing over whether Russia will default on its sovereign bonds after Moscow made two coupon payments in roubles last week. Both notes have a 30-day grace period. If Russia defaults, it will be the first time it's happened since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. US stocks have extended their declines in afternoon trading as investors focus on surging inflation and the looming threat of further interest rate rises. Major tech companies led losses on the S&P 500, which the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped 2pc. Oil prices declined as China's latest Covid outbreak sparked fears about demand. Sentiment continues to be driven by worries about the Federal Reserve's plans for tightening monetary policy, commodity disruptions caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the prospect of an economic slowdown. The British visual effects producer whose work includes latest James Bond blockbuster No Time To Die is said to be preparing for a sale that could value it at up to £300m. London-based Cinesite has hired Goldman Sachs to explore options for the business amid a flurry of dealmaking in the sector, Sky News reports. Cinesite was founded in Los Angeles in 1991 to work on a remake of the classic Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Its more recent Hollywood hits include Spider Man: No Way Home and Rocketman. The company is minority-owned by Gryphion Capital Investments, which backed it in 2019 alongside new debt facilities from Barclays and NatWest. Moscow has demanded that Google takes immediate steps to remove what it described as threats against Russians amid claims Google Translate suggested the phrase ""dead Russians"" instead of ""dear Russians"". The country's communications regulator said that when ""dear Russians"" was typed into Google's translator, it had also offered the variant ""dead Russians"" under the ""Did you mean"" section. The regulator, known as Roskomnadzor, said it did not offer such variants for the phrase with other nationalities. Google didn't appear to be suggesting this variant when the Telegraph tried it out. Roskomnadzor said it had told Google to ""immediately take measures to exclude statements of threats against Russian users"". Russia's current account surplus has surged to the highest since at least 1994 as revenues from oil and gas exports surged and imports plunged in the wake of western sanctions. Russia's central bank said its current account reached a surplus of $58.2bn (£44.7bn) in the first quarter, more than 2.5 times the $22.5bn reported a year earlier. While sweeping western sanctions are expected to trigger the biggest recession in decades, the measures so far haven't targeted Russia's all-important energy sector, keeping a key source of revenue to the Kremlin alive. However, a slump in imports is contributing to Russia's surging inflation and hitting living standards for ordinary citizens. Now that he's no longer joining Twitter's board, Elon Musk may buy up more shares in the social media company. The billionaire's abrupt reversal over taking up a board seat has fuelled more speculation over his intentions for Twitter since becoming its largest shareholder. By not becoming a director, Mr Musk is no longer bound by an agreement to keep his stake at no more than 14.9pc. According to a filing today, the Tesla boss has no “present plans or intentions” to acquire additional shares, but “reserves the right to change his plans at any time”. The filing also said Mr Musk could engage in discussions with the board about potential mergers and strategic alternatives. And, in an eyebrow-raising detail for the prolific tweeter, the filing noted that he can express his views to the board “or the public through social media or other channels.” Read more: 'For the best': Twitter chief welcomes Elon Musk's decision not to join board Wall Street has started the week on the back foot as worries over higher interest rates hit major tech stocks. The S&P 500 dropped 0.6pc and the Dow Jones was down 0.3pc. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was the hardest hit, tumbling 1.2pc. There's been further disruption to fuel supplies for petrol stations as environmental protests continued to target key oil terminals. Howard Cox, founder of Fair Fuel UK, said hundreds of motorists had had problems filling up their vehicles in recent days because of protests. He added that shortages primarily involved diesel and occurred mainly south of the Midlands. Earlier, as many as 12 people were locked to pipework at the Inter Terminal in Essex while others occupied a tunnel near Warwickshire’s Kingsbury Oil terminal, according to environmental group Just Stop Oil. It's the eleventh day of protests, during which Essex and Warwickshire police have arrested more than 500 people so far. A spokesman for the UK Petroleum Industry Association said: The ongoing protest activity is affecting some deliveries, but disruptions are localized and short-term only. Fuels continue to be delivered, meaning stocks are being replenished. Today #JustStopOil demand @10DowningStreet get a grip, stop lying, stop recklessly destroying our future. Start by ending new oil & gas. We will continue to disrupt until the govt makes a statement that it will end new oil & gas projects in the UK. https://t.co/5gawVEgJck — JustStopOil (@JustStop_Oil) April 11, 2022 One of the world's biggest paper makers has warned of shortages as mills scramble to secure enough wheat – a key part of the manufacturing process. Howard Mustoe has more: Starch from wheat, potatoes and other food is used to make paper for packaging. Wheat and starch prices have soared this year, risking the possibility of shortages, and governments are likely to have to prioritise food over paper if the situation persists. Paper is becoming more common for food packaging and a shortage could mean a return to single-use plastics, which are harder to recycle. Alex Manisty of DS Smith, the FTSE 100 packaging giant, said: “Corrugated board for cardboard boxes is absolutely critical for the food and drinks supply chain. “The worry is that when we get into next year that there might be shortages. For big companies like us we have contracts in place, but it is definitely something that could be an issue.” Read Howard's full story here Oil's losses have deepened this afternoon, with prices dropping more than 5pc as Covid lockdowns in China spark jitters about demand. Benchmark Brent crude slumped below $98 a barrel to its lowest level in a month, while West Texas Intermediate hit a six-week low under $94. Shanghai is entering its third week of lockdown amid a resurgence in Covid cases in the city, raising concerns that demand could cool. Meanwhile, traders are also weighing up dimming hope of a European ban on Russian oil imports. Apple is said to be facing an additional EU antitrust charge in the coming weeks as part of an investigation into music streaming triggered by a complaint from Spotify. The European Commission last year accused the iPhone maker of harming competition in the music streaming market through App Store rules that force developers to use its own in-app payment system. Regulators in the US and UK are also looking into the issue. Extra charges, reported by Reuters, are usually issued to companies when the watchdog has gathered new evidence or has modified some elements to boost its case. Pod Point has secured a deal with BMW to become the preferred supplier of domestic charging points. The three-year contract means the German car manufacturer will refer its UK customers to Pod Point when they buy a BMW or Mini electric vehicle. Shares in the London-listed firm jumped as much as 6.6pc following the announcement. Wall Street looks set to follow the FTSE into the red this afternoon as political and economic risks weigh on sentiment. US stocks are pointing lower, suggesting there'll be more pressure on global shares after the Federal Reserve last week signalled sharp interest rate rises and balance sheet reduction to curb soaring inflation. Futures tracking the benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.5pc, while the Dow Jones was down 0.2pc. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped 1pc. Going for a dip off the picturesque Cornish coast may sound picture-perfect, but for many British families it is not enough to be tempted away from foreign getaways this year. While pandemic-induced travel restrictions brought about the rise of the “staycation”, swathes of families are now once again opting for holidays in far-flung destinations. Hannah Boland reports: Staycations out of favour as holidaymakers head for the Med Natural gas prices have declined for the seventh straight session, with Russian flows to Europe continuing undisturbed as the war in Ukraine grinds on. Orders for Russian gas shipments via Ukraine edged higher today, but remained below capacity, while the Yamal-Europe pipeline continued to flow eastwards to Poland from Germany. Levels of gas flowing through the main Nord Stream pipeline remain high and stable. While the EU last week agreed to ban coal imports from Russia, gas has so far escaped sanctions – largely due to Europe's heavy reliance on Russian imports. Benchmark gas prices fell 2.2pc, while the UK equivalent was down 4.4pc. Insurance giant AIG is said to be considering cutting cover for Russia and Ukraine to shield itself from hefty claims as sanctions intensify and the war drags on. AIG is looking at adding exclusion clauses to policies for businesses operating in the region across a range of policies, Reuters reports. Other major insurers are also said to be looking to exclude Russia, Ukraine and even Belarus from their policies. If AIG were to cut back cover for businesses and companies operating in Russia and Ukraine it would be the first major insurer to do so, potentially paving the way for others to follow suit. While many companies have suspended operations in Russia or pulled out completely, some multinationals are still doing business there, as well as in Ukraine, in sectors ranging from agriculture to energy. They require insurance to keep their businesses open. Local companies also rely on insurance for damage to goods, buildings and vehicles and for injury or loss of life of employees. Oil prices have continued their decline this morning as China's Covid resurgence worsened, fuelling fears of lower demand from the world's biggest importer or crude. Benchmark Brent crude fell 2.3pc to hover just above $100 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate was trading below $96. Oil has now wiped out most of its gains since Russia's invasion of Ukraine as the market continues to be gripped by volatility. Fresh lockdown measures in Shanghai, as well as emergency oil releases by the US and IEA, have cooled wholesale prices, which jumped to almost $140 last month. Russian Railways has been ruled in default on a bond after missing an interest payment last month – the first such decision since Moscow was slapped with tough sanctions. A failure-to-pay credit event occurred after a coupon due on March 14 failed to reach investors by the end of a 10-day grace period, according to the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee. Contracts insuring the company’s debt against default will be triggered, and holders will now wait to see how much will be paid. The decision comes as investors focus on whether the country’s sovereign bonds will default after Russia made two coupon payments in roubles last week, even though the notes didn’t allow for it. Both notes have a 30-day grace period. If Russia defaults, it will be the first time it's happened since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. The Kremlin has once again insisted that Russia has the resources to pay its debt, meaning there was no objective reason for a default. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""There can only be a technical, man-made default. ""There are no objective reasons for such a default. Russia has everything it needs to fulfil all its obligations."" Russia has edged closed to default after sanctions forced it to pay dollar bondholders in roubles. The cost of insuring the Kremlin’s debt now signals a record 99pc chance of default within a year. Earlier today Moscow halted bond sales for the rest of the year, warning borrowing costs would be ""cosmic"". The UK's transport, logistics and warehousing industry has almost doubled since 2011 thanks to surging demand for online shopping. A report from the ONS shows the industry has grown by a fifth since the start of Covid alone, making it Britain's fastest-growing sector. It grew at twice the pace of information and communication – despite the continued growth of tech – and eight times faster than retail overall. In 2021, the number of UK business premises classified as “transport and storage” was 88% higher than in 2011 and 21% higher than in 2019. Transport and storage includes: ▪️passenger transport ▪️haulage ▪️warehousing ▪️and postal and courier activities. pic.twitter.com/YGMxA68XT5 — Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) April 11, 2022 Glencore is trading back above its initial offering price for the first time since 2011 as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to drive up commodities prices. Shares rose above 530p this morning, having surged 42pc this year. Nearly all the company's most important commodities are trading at or near record levels, with markets in turmoil as the war and ensuing sanctions fuel fears over supply. The share price growth also comes after a strong year for the world's largest commodities trader. Glencore reported record profits in February and announced $4bn (£3bn) in share buybacks and dividends. ICYMI – The American owner of Boots risks losing billions after the one-time favourite to buy the chemist chain valued the retailer at a steep discount. Oliver Gill has the story: Buyout funds CVC and Bain indicated that they were willing to pay just £4bn for the business, according to City sources. The consortium bowed out of the running last month. A spokesman for Boots said that the pair did not lodge a formal offer. Walgreens, the US retail giant, took control of Boots in 2014 in a deal worth £9bn. It has put a £7bn price tag on the UK chain after selling its wholesale arm last year. The low valuation is significant because CVC’s UK head is Dominic Murphy, who sits on the board of Walgreens and has been involved with Boots for 15 years. CVC and Bain were the early frontrunners after Walgreens hired Goldman Sachs to sell Boots at the end of last year. “He [Mr Murphy] knows where the bodies are buried,” said one City source. ​Read Ollie's full story here Sterling has lost ground against both the dollar and euro after new data showed the UK economy slowed more sharply than expected in February. GDP rose 0.1pc that month, down from 0.8pc in January and below expectations of 0.2pc. The pound dipped 0.1pc against the dollar to $1.3025 after briefly falling below $1.30, remaining not far from its lowest level since November 2020. Against the euro it was down 0.4pc at 83.75p. Despite the grim outlook for the economy, markets are still expecting the Bank of England to raise interest rates at its meeting next month. The EU is drafting proposals for a potential ban on Russian oil imports, bloc officials have said. Simon Coveney, Ireland's foreign minister, said the European Commission was ""working on ensuring that oil is part of the next sanctions package"". His Dutch and Lithuanian counterparts also said the bloc was looking at ways at targeting Russian oil – which makes up about a quarter of the EU's crude imports – as a means to pressure Russia to halt the shelling of Ukrainian cities. The EU last week announced an embargo on Russian coal, but is yet to roll out wider sanctions against the Kremlin's energy sector. While calls have been growing for a ban on oil and gas, the move has faced opposition from Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian imports. Twitter shares have slumped as much as 8pc in pre-market trading after the company said Elon Musk had decided not to join its board. The U-turn will ignite fresh speculation about the billionaire's intentions for Twitter. If he doesn't join the board, the Tesla tycoon won't be subject to an agreement to keep his stake at no more than 14.9pc. Read more: Elon Musk will no longer join Twitter’s board Pret A Manger is set to expand into the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland for the first time, opening 20 shops over the next decade. The coffee chain said the deal with franchise partner Carebrook Partnership will create around 500 jobs. The first site will open on Dawson Street in Dublin this summer. Carebook is one of Pret's longest-serving franchise partners, working with the business for more than three decades and overseeing many outlets in London, including Camden, Belsize Park and Finchley. It comes after the chain last year it planned to double the size of the business within five years, including launching in five new markets by the end of 2023. Pano Christou, chief executive of Pret A Manger, said: Setting up shop in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland has been our plan for a long time, and we’re thrilled that we’re finally able to make it happen. There has long been demand from our neighbours on the island of Ireland to bring Pret’s freshly prepared food and organic coffee, and now with the backing of Carebrook Partnership we’re able to do so. We look forward to making this partnership a success. The rouble has dropped sharply in volatile trading this morning after Russia relaxed some capital control measures aimed at propping up the currency. The central bank said it will scrap a 12pc commission for buying foreign currency through brokerages from April 11 and lift a temporary ban on selling foreign exchange cash to individuals from April 18. The rouble fell nearly 5pc in early trading to 79.90 against the dollar, while it was 4.3pc down against the euro at 86.35. Moscow is still keeping the rouble supported by forcing companies to convert 80pc of foreign exchange revenues, as well as high interest rates. Societe Generale will take a hit of about €3bn (£2.5bn) after agreeing to sell its Rosbank stake to Russia's richest businessman. The Paris-based bank has agreed to sell its entire holding in the Russian lender and its insurance subsidiaries to Interros Capital, the investment firm run by Vladimir Potanin. SocGen said it’s sticking to its plans for a stock buyback of €915m and 2021 dividend of €1.65 a share despite the financial hit. Shares rose almost 6pc as the deal removed uncertainty over the bank's Russia exit. Mr Potanin has a net worth of €29.6bn and is the world's 43rd richest person, according to Bloomberg. He is president of Norilsk Nickel and has a stake in Russian company Petrovax Pharm. The oligarch had avoided sanctions by western governments until Canada recently added him to its sanctions list. Passenger numbers at Heathrow Airport bounced back to their highest since the pandemic began last month thanks to the easing of Covid restrictions. Heathrow said outbound leisure travel had recovered strongly, but that inbound leisure and business travel remained weak due to high levels of infections and testing requirements for travellers leaving the country. The transport hub also warned it was unclear whether the current surge in holiday demand was sustainable due to concerns over new variants, high fuel prices and a cost-of-living crisis. Heathrow is one of a number of airports that have struggled with staff shortages amid Covid-related absences and a surge in demand. It said it was increasing resources as quickly as possible, with 12,000 new starters planned across the airport. It's a lacklustre start to the week for the FTSE 100, which has been dragged down by sluggish GDP figures for February. The blue-chip index has extended early losses to drop 0.5pc, having capped off its fifth weekly gain on Friday. Oil heavyweights BP and Shell both tumbled 0.9pc while miners including Anglo American and Rio Tinto lost ground, as Covid lockdowns in China dragged down oil and metal prices. Consumer staple stocks including Unilever and AstraZeneca were also firmly in the red, bringing down the index. It came after the latest GDP figures showed the economy expanded just 0.1pc in February, with a slump in manufacturing denting progress. The domestically-focused FTSE 250 slipped only marginally. John Wood jumped around 6pc to the top of the mid-cap index after an upbeat trading update. Tesla founder Elon Musk has decided not to join Twitter’s board, the social media firm’s chief executive tweeted, an unexpected twist to a saga that’s captivated the online community for days. Musk had held discussions with Twitter’s directors but the entrepreneur ultimately declined their offer of a board seat, Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal tweeted. “I believe this is for the best,” the Twitter chief executive said in an internal memo he shared. Read the full story here Elon has decided not to join our board. I sent a brief note to the company, sharing with you all here. pic.twitter.com/lfrXACavvk — Parag Agrawal (@paraga) April 11, 2022 Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, says there are worrying signs that underlying demand is weakening. We have become used to the economic news following the path of the pandemic, and there are elements of this in today’s GDP data for February: a reduction in activity from the scaling back of the Test-and-Trace programme and an increase from the loosening of remaining travel restrictions, particularly for February half term. However, today’s data may also contain early signs that underlying demand in the economy is weakening, with output in the production sector falling by 0.6pc in February, and particular difficulties in car, electronic and chemical manufacturing. If this weakness is due to the unavailability of components, then it may correct itself in future although the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine will make that harder in the short-run. However, if it is due to falling demand from the end consumer, worried about the rising cost of living, then there may be further economic clouds on the horizon in the months ahead. The FTSE 100 has started the week on the back foot after disappointing GDP data for February. The blue-chip index fell 0.3pc at the open to 7,647 points. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, says the post-Christmas economic slowdown was even quicker than expected. The news that the economy was hardly growing at all in February suggests the economy had a little less momentum in the first quarter than we had previously thought, and increases the risk of a contraction in GDP in the coming months as the squeeze on household real incomes intensifies [...] The pace of the recovery was already going to slow once the post-omicron bounce faded and the squeeze on household real incomes intensified. But we hadn’t expected it to slow so much so soon. We now think the economy may have grown by 1pc quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter as a whole, down from our previous estimate of 1.1pc. And the risks for our economy to grow by 0.2pc quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter are tilted to the downside. Even so, with high inflation feeding through into higher price/wage expectations, we doubt this will prevent the Bank of England from raising interest rates further to 1pc at its next meeting on 5 May, and to 2pc next year. Darren Morgan at the ONS said: The economy was little changed in February with the easing of restrictions for overseas travel – an increased confidence in booking holidays in the UK – triggering strong growth in travel agencies, tour operators and hotels. This was partially offset by the reduction of the Test and Trace vaccination programmes, which made a strong contribution to GDP at the start of the year. Manufacturing fell notably, with motor manufacturers continuing to struggle to source parts. With today's growth, the economy now stands 1.5pc above its pre-pandemic level. GDP grew 0.1% in February ad is now 1.5% above its pre-pandemic level.Services grew 0.2% (2.1% above), manufacturing fell 0.4% (0.7% below) and construction fell 0.1% (1.1% above) https://t.co/tXQpG2fBnX pic.twitter.com/FnduF93fUC — Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) April 11, 2022 Closer to home, there's new data out this morning showing the UK economy grew less than expected in February after industrial production and construction shrank. GDP ticked up 0.1pc, down from a January's 0.8pc gain and below expectations of 0.2pc, according to the ONS. It means the UK economy is 1.5pc above its pre-pandemic level in February 2020. There was growth in the services sector as the easing of Covid restrictions helped drive more tourism activity. But manufacturing dropped unexpectedly, driven by shortages that hit output from car makers. Construction also fell, driven by a decrease in repair and maintenance work. Anna Bjerde at the World Bank said: The results of our analysis are very sobering. Our forecasts show that the Russian invasion in Ukraine has reversed the region's recovery from the pandemic. This is the second major shock to hit the regional economy in two years and comes at a very precarious time for the region, as many economies were still struggling to recover from the pandemic. Read more on this story: Russians slash their spending as sanctions batter the economy Good morning.  The World Bank has issued dire forecasts for both Ukraine and Russia this year as a result of the war, warning the outlook could get even bleaker if the conflict drags on. Ukraine's economy will collapse by 45.1pc this year, the bank predicted, far worse than the 10pc to 35pc downturn the IMF projected last month. Russia's GDP is expected to decline 11.2pc. In a more pessimistic scenario, which reflects an escalation of the conflict, there would be a larger negative impact on the euro area, increased western sanctions and a financial shock due to eroding confidence. The region's economy would contract by nearly 9pc – worse than the 2008 global financial crisis – with a 20pc decline for Russia and a 75pc collapse for Ukraine, the report said. 1) Up to 40,000 civil service jobs face the axe: The number of civil servants has jumped by more than a fifth to 485,000 in the past seven years in response to Covid and Brexit 2) Russians slash their spending as sanctions batter the economy: Spending falls by 10pc as economists expect Russia to be hit by a deep two-year recession 3) Airlines brace for £100m bill from Easter travel chaos: Further flight cancellations are expected over the next week as Easter travel chaos continues 4) Ambrose Evans-Pritchard: Marine Le Pen's national socialism is a potent political brew: The economic agenda of Emmanuel Macron's opponent is a celebration of the welfare state and the French social model 5) Twitter must wean itself off advertising, says Elon Musk: Biggest shareholder calls for price cuts and improvements to Twitter's paid-for subscription service Asian shares dropped on Monday, while the euro edged up a fraction as the far right lost the first round of the French presidential elections.

4/12/2022,"In the week ending April 7, 2022, mortgage rates rose for a fifth consecutive week. 30-year fixed rates rose by 5 basis points to 4.72%. 30-year fixed rates surged by 25 basis points in the week prior. It was the highest mortgage rate since 4.75% on December 5, 2018. Year-on-year, 30-year fixed rates were up by 159 basis points. 30-year fixed rates were down by 22 basis points since November 2018’s last peak of 4.94%. In the first half of the week, the focus was on factory orders and service sector PMIs. The stats were mixed. Factory orders fell by 0.5% in February, partially reversing a 1.5% rise from January, while service sector activity improved. In March, the market’s preferred ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI increased from 56.5 to 58.3. With the stats dollar positive, the FOMC meeting minutes were also dollar positive mid-week. More hawkish than anticipated minutes drove U.S Treasury yields northwards. The minutes revealed plans to begin cutting the FED balance sheet by $95bn per month amidst a rising interest rate environment to curb inflation. The weekly average rates for new mortgages, as of April-7, 2022, were quoted by Freddie Mac to be: 30-year fixed rates increased by 5 basis points to 4.72% in the week. This time last year, rates had stood at 3.13%. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.8 points. 15-year fixed rates rose by 8 basis points to 3.91% in the week. Rates were up by 149 basis points from 2.42% a year ago. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.8 points. 5-year fixed rates increased by 6 basis points to 3.56%. Rates were up by 64 basis points from 2.92% a year ago. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.3 points. According to Freddie Mac, Mortgage rates have seen the fastest 3-month rise since May 1994. Increased mortgage rates have hit purchase demand. Monthly payments for those looking to buy a home have risen by at least 20% from a year ago. For the week ending April 1, 2022, the rates were: Average interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances rose from 4.80% to 4.90%. Points decreased from 0.56 to 0.53 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates backed by FHA increased from 4.66% to 4.90%. Points fell from 0.71 to 0.68 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances increased from 4.40% to 4.51%. Points declined from 0.44 to 0.34 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Weekly figures released by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that the Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, declined 6.3% in the week ending April-01. The Index fell by 6.8% in the previous week. The Refinance Index slid by 10% and was 62% lower than the same week one year ago. In the week prior, the Index tumbled by 15%. The refinance share of mortgage activity decreased from 40.6% to 38.8% of total applications. In the previous week, the share fell from 44.8% to 40.6%. According to the MBA, Mortgage application volume continues to fall due to the upswing in mortgage rates, driven by sentiment towards monetary policy. As higher rates reduce the incentive to refinance, application volume fell to its lowest since Spring 2019. Strong labor market conditions and wage growth have supported housing demand despite surging mortgage rates and house price appreciation. Inventories continue to peg back purchase activity, however. The week kicks off with inflation figures due out on Tuesday. Expect plenty of market sensitivity to the numbers following last week’s hawkish FOMC meeting minutes. On Wednesday, wholesale inflation figures will also draw interest ahead. Away from the economic data, Russia and Ukraine will remain an area of focus for the global financial markets.

4/12/2022,"The one good thing about a market downturn? You get lots of opportunities to load up on shares at a discount entry point. And who doesn’t like a discount? With the way the markets have performed so far this year, there are stocks in every segment which could potentially offer plenty of rewards. CNBC’s Jim Cramer thinks there are several names in the retail sector which look particularly enticing right now, ones for which the term “beaten-down” readily applies. Some rallied nicely toward the end of last week, but following the severe market-wide pullback, Cramer notes that it will take “many more days” before multiple names approach “being expensive again.” Taking a look at Cramer’s choices, we ran through the TipRanks database three stocks the Mad Money host thinks will make good additions to investors’ portfolios. This way we can gauge whether Wall Street’s cadre of experts agree with his selections. Let’s take a look at the results. Bath & Body Works (BBWI) Lots of stocks might be on sale right now but the same cannot be said of household goods. Prices are on the up, and macroeconomic worries around consumer spending amid rising inflation have investors feeling shaky in 2022. Shares of Bath & Body Works have suffered from this development and are down by 41% from the peak notched in November. The company is the U.S.’s biggest specialty home fragrance & fragrant body care business, boasting more than 2,000 U.S. and international stores, a meaningful online presence and serving north of 50 million consumers. Last August, the company rebranded from L Brands to its current moniker and spun off its Victoria’s Secret business. Now, its three main revenue generating segments - home fragrance, body care & fragrances and soaps & sanitizers – helped the company deliver revenue of $7.882 billion in 2021 (for the period ending on Jan 31). At the same time, the company raked in record sales in 4Q21, dialing in a set of results which beat Street expectations. Revenue increased by 11.4% year-over-year to reach $3.03 billion, just beating the Street’s $2.96 billion estimate. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.30 also beat Wall Street’s forecast - by $0.03. However, the company’s forecast called for modest earnings declines for Q1 and for the full-year 2022, developments investors did not like, while CEO Andrew Meslow’s departure on health reasons further clouded the outlook. That said, BMO’s Simeon Siegel agrees with Cramer’s assessment that the stock is ripe for the picking at present. The analyst writes: “We believe the challenging environment, a broad lack of investor appetite and expectations of this conservative guide have created extremely compelling long-term entry points and we suggest buying the recent weakness as we see upside to the reset numbers and long-term multiple re-rating.” To this end, Siegel rates BBWI shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), backed by an $83 price target. This makes room for one-year growth of ~80%. (To watch Siegel’s track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, other analysts are in agreement. 12 Buys and 2 Holds add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. In addition, the $78.93 average price target brings the upside potential to 71%. (See BBWI stock forecast on TipRanks) Signet Jewelers (SIG) For the next Cramer pick, let’s shift gears and move from fragrance to jewelry. Signet is nothing less than the largest diamond jewelry retailer in the world. Operating mostly in the middle market jewelry segment, the company also boasts leading market positions in Canada and the UK specialty jewelry sectors, while also claiming top spot in the mid-tier U.S. jewelry and watch market. This is a sizeable market worth over $90 billion of which Signet claims ~6% share and has set its sights on growing to ~10% over the next few years. Once again, we are talking of a stock that has shed plenty of its value recently. Shares are down by 34% since November’s high as the same set of worries that has plagued others has driven the share price lower – inflation’s impact on discretionary spending and the prospect of a recession. Plus, Signet has already said it will no longer purchase gems from Russia - the world’s largest source of gems. These are things to be concerned about but going by the company’s latest set of quarterly results and outlook, Signet appears to be coping just fine. Non-GAAP EPS of $5.01 hit Street targets and revenue increased by 28.3% year-over-year to reach $2.81 billion, in turn beating the analysts’ $2.41 billion forecast. Even more promisingly, in today’s difficult environment, for 1Q23, the company expects total revenue to come in between $1.78 billion to $1.82 billion. Consensus had that figure at $1.74 billion. That is an impressive feat, says Wells Fargo’s Ike Boruchow, who backs Cramer’s take too. “With QTD remaining very strong (during a key selling period, Valentine's Day) we believe it shows that a weakening low-end consumer doesn't take the SIG bull case off the rails,” the analyst said. “In fact, SIG may be the first company in our space to guide 1Q numbers up. With a war chest of cash on the balance sheet and fundamental momentum, we view the story as one of the best in the space today and SIG remains a 'Top Pick' for us.” Bearing this in mind, Boruchow rates SIG an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $105 price target. Should this target be met, a twelve-month gain of ~50% could be in the cards. (To watch Boruchow's track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, analysts are split right down the middle when it comes to SIG. 2 Buys and 2 Sells add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Additionally, the $109.25 average price target implies ~56% upside from current levels. (See SIG stock forecast on TipRanks) Macy’s (M) Smelling fragrant and looking sparkly, it’s time to head out to the department store, to fabled U.S. institution Macy’s. While the company cannot claim anymore to own the world’s largest department store, its flagship New York City spot is still the U.S’s biggest, boasting retail space of 1.25 million square feet. That store is just one of 725 department stores spread out across the U.S. which includes the Macy's, Macy's Backstage, Market by Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and bluemercury brands. Macy’s also has an international presence, with licensed stores in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, and Al Zahra, Kuwait. Department stores suffered badly during the height of the pandemic lock down period of 2020 but staged a big comeback last year. Macy’s fortunes aligned with the overall trend, and the improvement was evident in the company’ latest quarterly financial statement for 4Q21. Revenue increased by ~28% from the same period last year to clock in at $8.67 billion coming in ahead of the Street’s call of $8.45 billion. There was a fine beat on the bottom-line as adj. EPS of $2.45 beat the $1.99 consensus estimate. There was more good news on the outlook. Macy’s guided for 2022 revenue and EPS of $24.46-$24.70 billion and $4.13-$4.52, respectively, which at the mid-point came in 2% and 7% above Street expectations, respectively. So, with shares having adhered to the trend, and down by 36% since November’s yearly high, you can see why Cramer thinks it is time to load up. However, Morgan Stanley’s Kimberly Greenberger begs to differ, and explains why she holds a bearish view on Macy’s prospects. “At first blush the guidance suggests M's performance could be relatively stable against last year's strong consumer environment with 2022 revenue flat to up 1% y/y. However, management's outlook implies outsized 1Q y/y revenue growth followed by revenue declines y/y in 2Q-4Q as the business laps peak consumer demand,” Greenberger explained. “M's best financial performance may be in the rear-view mirror. As such, we remain cautious on L-T revenue & earnings growth potential.” Accordingly, Greenberger rates Macy an Underweight (i.e. Sell) and her $20 price target suggests shares will drift 16% lower over the coming months. (To watch Greenberger’s track record, click here) The Street’s outlook for M stock is a little confusing; on the one hand, based on 4 Holds and 3 Buys and Sells, each, the stock makes do with a Hold consensus rating. However, the average target is resolutely positive; at $31.22, the figure implies gains of 31% could be in store over the one-year timeframe.
