12/31/2021,"InfoWars host Alex Jones came out swinging against former President Donald Trump on Wednesday. Angered by Trump's support of vaccines, Jones threatened to ""dish all the dirt"" on him. Jones criticized Trump's social media platform TruthSocial, hinting that it isn't ""a real network."" InfoWars host Alex Jones tore into former President Donald Trump and his upcoming social network platform TruthSocial over Trump's recent public approval of COVID-19 vaccines. On Wednesday, Jones, previously a staunch and outspoken Trump supporter, told listeners of his InfoWars show to ""move on"" from the former president. ""Yeah, we all wish Trump would do the right thing. But listen, I've got the inside baseball on Trump — he doesn't know what's going on. And I'm not even defending Trump, I'm just saying we've got to move on,"" said Jones, a prominent conspiracy theorist on the right-wing fringe. He then threatened to ""dish all the dirt"" on Trump, saying he had access to unnamed sources from ""inside Trump's camp,"" The Daily Beast's Zach Petrizzo first reported. ""It's not to hurt Trump, it's so people can know how pathetic he is when you think he is playing 4D chess [and] going to save you and he's not,"" Jones said. He said that Trump is ""not a bad guy,"" but added that the former president ""doesn't know what he's doing"" and is ""surrounded by bad advisers."" Jones proceeded to criticize TruthSocial as well. ""He's got that multibillion-dollar social media network based on Mastodon that they said's an original program that doesn't even work,"" he said. ""And there's all these SEC criminal investigations of it right now,"" Jones continued. ""And it's all falling apart."" Trump revealed during a Dec. 19 appearance with former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that he'd gotten a booster shot and told people in the crowd not to boo because of it. Later in an interview with conservative commentator and activist Candace Owens, he repeated the same sentiment. ""Trump did a lot of good, and I believed in him,"" Jones later said after Trump's comments. ""So, the fact that he's done this makes it personal. It makes it hurt!"" ""You are either completely ignorant... or you are one of the most evil men who ever lived,"" he also said during a Christmas broadcast of his show. —Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) December 25, 2021 Jones joins several far-right commentators in their newfound criticism of the former president. Others who have recently lashed out against the former president include radio host and longtime Trump supporter Wayne Allyn Root, who said on Jones' show that Trump is ""horribly wrong"" about the vaccines and ""needs an intervention."" ""Stop the Steal"" organizer Ali Alexander blasted Trump as well, writing on his Telegram channel: ""Trump, stop. Just stop. Have your position (backed by Fauci) and allow us to have ours (which is backed by science). This losing is getting boomer level annoying.""
