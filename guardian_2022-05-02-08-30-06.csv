5/2/2022,"Labour has accused ministers of a potential cover-up over a PPE contract with a company linked to Tory peer Michelle Mone, after the health department refused to release documents connected to the deal, citing commercial sensitivities. The row comes days after the National Crime Agency (NCA) searched Mone’s home as part of a potential fraud investigation into the company, PPE Medpro, which won more than £200m in government contracts without public tender. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, wrote to the government in January to seek the release of correspondence and records connected to the deal, as happened over a testing contract won by another company, Randox, after lobbying by the then Tory MP Owen Paterson. In the letter, Rayner noted that Medpro won the two contracts via a “VIP lane” for politically connected companies after Mone contacted two ministers in May 2020 to say she could source PPE. “I would ask now that the government takes the same approach as it has to the contract with Randox, which was a similar matter of controversy, and commits now to place all correspondence and records relating to the award in the library of the house [of Commons] for parliamentary scrutiny,” Rayner wrote. In a reply sent last week, the junior health minister Edward Argar defended the efforts made to buy medical protective supplies at the start of the Covid pandemic, saying the alternative was “not securing the PPE that was desperately needed; clearly not an option”. “All offers underwent rigorous financial, commercial, legal and policy assessments,” Argar said, adding that decisions were made by officials, with no evidence ministers were involved, and that “due diligence checks were appropriate given the circumstances”. He added: “However, we are unable to provide correspondence and records relating to the award of the PPE Medpro contract as these remain commercially sensitive, given the department is currently engaged in a mediation process concerning the products it received from PPE Medpro Ltd, which involves confidentiality undertakings.” The 25m medical gowns supplied by the company were never used after officials rejected them after an inspection, with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) seeking to recover money from PPE Medpro through mediation. PPE Medpro has maintained that it complied with the terms of its gowns contract and is entitled to keep the money it was paid. In a statement, Rayner said the government’s refusal to release the documents “reeks of a cover-up”. She said: “The fact that Medpro is in mediation for providing useless PPE is no excuse for failing to be transparent with the public – in fact it only strengthens the need for clarity about how this eye-watering waste was allowed to happen. “The government have shown complete disregard for working people by wasting taxpayers’ money on dodgy contracts.” On Wednesday, the NCA searched several properties associated with Medpro in the Isle of Man and London, including the Isle of Man office building where PPE Medpro is registered and the mansion where Lady Mone lives with her husband, the business magnate Douglas Barrowman. Responding to previous stories, Mone’s lawyers have said any suggestion of an association or collusion between the Tory peer and PPE Medpro would be “inaccurate” and that she was not involved in the business. “Baroness Mone is neither an investor, director or shareholder in any way associated with PPE Medpro. She has never had any role or function in PPE Medpro, nor in the process by which contracts were awarded to PPE Medpro.” Mone’s lawyers have said that after she undertook the “simple, solitary and brief step” of referring PPE Medpro to the government she did nothing further in respect of the company. The Isle of Man constabulary confirmed that search warrants were executed at four addresses on the island on Wednesday “in support of an ongoing NCA investigation”. There were no arrests. The DHSC referred any queries on Medpro to the NCA.",News/Politics,Labour says government refusal to publish PPE firm’s contracts ‘reeks of cover-up’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/02/labour-says-government-refusal-to-publish-ppe-firms-contracts-reeks-of-cover-up
5/2/2022,"The nation’s green spaces are worth £25.6bn in “welfare value” a year, according to a new study. Scientists have said this flies in the face of decisions by councils to cut nature areas. The research, funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, has created an outdoor recreation valuation tool (Orval). This assesses the value provided by each park, wood, riverside walk, country path and beach across England and Wales, while also identifying which residents enjoy the benefits of each green space and when they do so. Researchers, who ranked each park in terms of value for money and wellbeing, discovered that small parks delivered the highest recreation value, and that three key drivers to increased outdoor recreation were the weather, good access to quality green spaces and dog ownership. They also found the top 10 most valuable recreation sites, which were all in or around urban areas. Hyde Park in London, Sutton Park in Birmingham and Blaise Castle estate in Bristol are the top three. Brett Day, a professor of environmental economics at the University of Exeter and one of the authors of the research, said: “The great contribution of this study is that it puts a figure to the value of our green spaces: £25.6bn a year. “The size of that benefit stands in stark contrast to the deep cuts in green space budgets across UK councils, cuts that threaten to condemn our green spaces to neglect and disrepair. “The Orval tool makes explicit the very real, but all-too-often-ignored, losses that people endure as a consequence. “Recreational access is not the same for all people, not just because of where they live but because of things like access to a car. Orval can show decision-makers how to locate new facilities in a way that will provide the most benefit to more disadvantaged groups and give them better access to the environment.” The report also found that dog owners were four times more likely to use recreation spaces, but people from ethnic minority backgrounds and in less affluent socioeconomic groups were less likely to engage in outdoor recreation, even when given the same recreation opportunities. A white person is 1.8 times more likely to take a trip to a recreation site than a black person, and the richest socioeconomic group is 1.6 times more likely to take a trip than the poorest.

5/2/2022,"Researchers are hoping to unleash a generation of smarter guide dogs by studying the cognitive behaviour of puppies and finding out who the clever boys and girls really are. Guide Dogs, the sight loss charity, will analyse the responses of eight-week-old puppies to see which ones best handle surprises, how they interact with human voices and how they react to difficult and sometimes impossible problems. The results will then be tracked as the dogs mature to work out what makes a good guide dog and the information will be used to improve breeding programmes. The charity is already swabbing animals for DNA samples to help improve the performance of future generations. “What we’re looking at is how our dogs are able to problem solve,” said Dr Helen Whiteside, chief scientific officer at the £112m-a-year charity. “From the breeding perspective what we might be doing is looking at which aspects of this are heritable … so that we can make sure that we’re keeping those amazing traits that are fantastic within our breeding population.” The puppies will participate in six tasks, including an unsolvable task during which a closed container with visible food inside is placed in front of the puppy; its responses are monitored and after 30 seconds, the box is opened. In an odour discrimination activity, a puppy will be presented with two tubes: one with food and one without, which are switched to see if the puppy can determine where the food is. A surprising events task will involve three different items appearing in an assessment pen: a bin bag containing crumpled paper, an umbrella opening and a metal sheet. The puppy’s reactions are then monitored. Giving an example of where a guide dog might need to solve a problem, Becky Hunt, canine science associate at the charity, said: “If they’re walking down the street and there’s a car parked on the road and there’s not enough space for both of them to fit through, the dog has to kind of solve that problem. Is it safe to go and walk around that car?” She added: “Essentially, we want to improve our breeding programme, we want to improve what we do, we want to improve supporting our dogs.” Guide Dogs aims every year to partner 1,000 dogs with people who need them to assist with everyday life. The charity said the activities are designed to be fun and interesting, but if a puppy does not want to engage or shows any signs of being uncomfortable, the task will be stopped.",Lifestyle/Life and style,UK guide dog charity seeks brainy puppies to help breed problem-solvers,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/02/guide-dogs-brainy-puppies-breed-problem-solvers
5/2/2022,"The distinctive sight and sound of a Dartford warbler singing from the top of a sprig of gorse in the May sunshine is making a welcome comeback after the bird almost became extinct half a century ago. Dartford warblers suffered a population crash and were at risk of vanishing from the UK in the 1960s, largely because of loss of the lowland heathland they thrive in. But the RSPB is reporting the highest recorded number of Dartford warblers – 183 pairs – at its reserves including RSPB Arne in Dorset and RSPB Minsmere in Suffolk. As well as needing the cover provided by gorse, the bird is susceptible to harsh weather and was almost wiped out in the big freeze of 1962-3 but recent milder weather has helped it to bounce back. The population has recovered in recent years and by 2019, 23 pairs were found at the Minsmere coastal reserve; the figures show that there are now 37 pairs there. Mel Kemp, the warden at Minsmere, who has overseen heathland restoration at the site, said: “We have seen a steady increase in the number of Dartford warblers, alongside other species relying on heathland habitats such as nightjar. All the hard work of restoring this habitat has really paid off.” The Dartford warblers are long-tailed warblers; male slate grey and chestnut birds are often spotted singing from the tops of gorse bushes in the spring sunshine, hoping to attract a mate. As well as being the perfect singing platform, the spiky shrub provides a safe nesting place and hunting ground for the bird, which specialises in picking spiders and caterpillars from their hiding places. Heathland supports a range of wildlife, from birds and mammals to insects, reptiles and amphibians but it is one of the UK’s most threatened homes for nature, with 80% lost since the 1800s through change of land use. Kemp said: “We need to continue to restore, manage and protect the heathland we have left here in the UK to best ensure the future of not just the Dartford warbler, but many other species.” As well as doing well in Dorset and Suffolk, Dartford warblers have been seen at RSPB reserves in Devon, Kent, Surrey and Hampshire. The return of the warbler is the second piece of good bird news in a week for Dorset after it was revealed that a pair of ospreys in Poole harbour had produced an egg, the first breeding attempt for the species in southern England for almost 200 years.",News/Environment,Dartford warbler is welcomed back from near-extinction ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/02/dartford-warbler-welcomed-near-extinction-rspb
5/2/2022,"Workers in Britain would be paid about £2,100 per year more on average if wages had matched a boom in company dividends handed to shareholders over the past two decades, according to a report. Highlighting a gulf between earnings from work and company ownership, the Common Wealth thinktank said far-reaching reforms were needed to rebalance power amid rising levels of inequality. Against a backdrop of mounting pressure on workers as wages fail to keep pace with the soaring cost of living, it urged the government to take action to increase workers’ rights and trade union negotiating strength, as well as delivering an increase in care funding and social security benefits. It comes as ministers face growing pressure to back a windfall tax on energy producers to counteract the cost of living crisis. Following a surge in wholesale oil and gas prices exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the energy firms Shell and BP are expected to report a sharp rise in profits later this week. Separate research from Common Wealth showed the two companies channelled £147bn to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks over the past decade. The business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, has lobbied against a windfall tax, writing to energy companies over the weekend urging them to increase investment to prevent more drastic action being taken by the cabinet. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has signalled that he is considering a windfall tax if Shell, BP and other exploration companies fail to spend excess profits on developing renewable energy projects. The shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, said: “Kwasi Kwarteng‘s letter is not worth the paper it is written on for millions of families facing the cost of living crisis. “Families want action to deal with the bills crisis, not a vacuous, insulting piece of political spin,” said Miliband, who added that energy investments were made over five to 10 years and that unplanned, untaxed windfall profits would always be returned to shareholders. Common Wealth, in a May Day statement alongside a group of other progressive thinktanks, including Autonomy, the Centre for Local Economic Strategies, and the Women’s Budget Group, said the UK’s biggest companies were enjoying booming profits while ordinary people were experiencing an unprecedented assault on their economic security. The findings of the report, based on Office for National Statistics figures, found that total labour compensation for UK households grew by 25% in total between 2000 and 2019 after taking account of inflation and growth in the UK’s working-age population. However, dividend payments by UK-based private corporations increased over the same time period by 132%. Common Wealth said that if the ratio between wages and dividends had stayed the same over the past two decades, then earnings from work would have been 18% higher, equivalent to £2,100 annually per working-age person. Official figures show that average pay in Britain remains below the pre-2008-crisis peak after inflation is taken into account, after more than a decade of stagnation, in the worst performance for workers’ pay since the Napoleonic wars. Forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s independent economics watchdog, show that average pay is expected to fall this year after inflation amid the soaring cost of living. Mathew Lawrence, the director of Common Wealth, said the government could launch a series of reforms to narrow the gap between wealthy asset owners and working people. “Political decisions on employment law and the rules governing the company have created an economy where power is stacked in favour of capital, and collectively created value is concentrated upwards,” he said. “What we have built we can reimagine. We can create an economy where working people have a much greater share in the wealth they create. But that will require a fundamental rebalancing of economic power.”",News/Business,"Rate of UK dividend growth far outstripping wage increases, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/02/uk-shareholder-dividends-wage-increases-inequality-report
