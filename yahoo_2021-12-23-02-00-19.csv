12/23/2021,"Every year around this time, two powerful forces conspire to artificially suppress stock prices — and create bargains: Lust and vanity. As for the first force — the lust for profits — this is when individual investors dump losers to create tax losses to offset gains. The second force — vanity — has fund managers putting “window dressing” on their portfolios to get out of losers so they don’t have to show them in annual reports, points out Bruce Kaser, editor of the Cabot Turnaround Letter.",Business/MarketWatch•2 hours ago,Five stocks to buy because company insiders love them as they get hit by year-end tax-loss selling,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/32cc09a1-1ac3-39a2-9d3c-25419d37d35a/five-stocks-to-buy-because.html
12/23/2021,"Some say cash is king. But according to Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, it may not be wise to keep too much of your investment money in cash these days. “Cash is not a safe investment, is not a safe place because it will be taxed by inflation,” Dalio told CNBC last month. Dalio’s concern came after U.S. inflation hit a 31-year high in October. And prices continued to climb. In November, the consumer price index rose 6.8% on a year-over-year basis, marking its fastest increase since June 1982. Simply put, consumers are taking a big hit in their purchasing power. So let’s take a look at three ways to hedge against inflation — one could be worth pouncing on with some of your extra cash. Gold is often considered the go-to safe haven asset. It can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money, and its value is largely unaffected by economic events around the world. The yellow metal has helped investors preserve wealth for centuries. Some believe this could be another one of its shiny moments. You can buy gold coins and bars at your local bullion shop. You can also look at large gold mining companies. If gold prices go up, these miners will earn higher revenue and profits, which tend to translate into higher share prices. For instance, companies like Barrick Gold, Newmont and Freeport-McMoRan typically do well during tough times for other sectors. There’s no need to start big. These days, you can build your own diversified portfolio just by using your leftover digital nickels and dimes. Once considered a niche asset, Bitcoin has entered the main stage. One reason people are increasingly adopting cryptocurrency is because they believe in its potential as an inflation hedge. Central banks can print money all they want, but the number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million by mathematical algorithms. Dalio recently said that Bitcoin is “almost a younger generation’s alternative to gold.” The price of Bitcoin has pulled back substantially in recent weeks, but is still up 60% year to date. If you want to buy Bitcoin directly, be aware many exchanges charge up to 4% in commission fees just to buy and sell crypto. A few investing apps charge 0%. Investors can also gain exposure through companies that have tied themselves to the crypto market. For instance, software technologist MicroStrategy has built a stash of 122,478 bitcoins. Electric vehicle giant Tesla holds around 43,200 bitcoins. Then there are pick-and-shovel plays like Coinbase Global, which runs the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. It’s true that these companies are all quite pricey, trading at between $238 and $899 per share. But you could get a smaller piece of Tesla or Coinbase by using an app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend. Stocks are volatile, cryptos make big swings to either side, and even gold is not immune to the market’s ups and downs. That’s why if you are looking for the ultimate hedge, it could be worthwhile to check out a real, but overlooked asset: fine art. Contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years, according to the Citi Global Art Market chart. And it’s becoming a popular way to diversify because it’s a real physical asset with little correlation to the stock market. On a scale of -1 to +1, with 0 representing no link at all, Citi found the correlation between contemporary art and the S&P 500 was just 0.12 during the past 25 years. Earlier this year, Bank of America investment chief Michael Harnett singled out artwork as a sharp way to outperform over the next decade — due largely to the asset’s track record as an inflation hedge. Investing in art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultrarich, like Dalio. But with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks just like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates do. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

12/23/2021,"Amid uncertain times, investors can take comfort in dividends. As we turn the page on 2021, it was undoubtedly another great year for stocks. All told, the S&P 500 should finish the year up about 25% if current levels hold for another week or so. That said, it's undeniable that many investors are starting to think about getting a bit more defensive in the new year. It's not just the threat of price inflation or disruptions from omicron -- it's also the hard reality that after 31% gains in 2019 and 18% gains in 2020, there might not be another huge year ahead of us for stocks. So if you're viewing your portfolio with some trepidation despite the end of a pretty good year, you may want to consider some of the following dividend stocks that offer stability and income that could serve as a firm foundation for your portfolio regardless of growth trends in 2022. AllianceBernstein Holding LP (ticker: AB) A New York-based asset manager that has been making a name for itself since its foundation in the 1980s, AllianceBernstein provides research and investment services to high-net-worth and institutional clients, including corporate and government pension plans, trusts and estates, and business entities offering 401(k)s and other services to employees. In addition to making the right money moves lately, AB has also benefitted from a general uncertainty in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic that has prompted many institutions to seek out expert financial advice. Earnings and revenue are trending steadily higher and shares have outperformed nicely in 2021 in addition to offering a significant stream of income to shareholders. Camping World Holdings Inc. (CWH) More of a ""glamping,"" or glamorous camping, play than an investment in traditional camping gear, the $3 billion CWH is America's largest dealer of recreational vehicles. These include small pop-up campers and full-size rigs that are essentially mobile vacation homes. The company is also happy to add on after-market sales including upscale furniture, flooring, window treatments, generators and other creature comforts. Driven by the social distancing phenomenon of 2020 and continued interest in outdoor living this year, Camping World is predicting more than 20% revenue growth for fiscal 2021. It also pays a generous 50-cent quarterly dividend good for a yield north of 5%. Chimera Investment Corp. (CIM) Chimera operates as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, even though it doesn't hold any tangible property assets. Instead, the company invests in a portfolio of mortgage assets, including mainly residential mortgage loans. By being taxed as a REIT, however, CIM is not subject to federal corporate income taxes so long as it distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders. That means a mandate for big dividends -- and thanks to a robust U.S. mortgage lending market, shares have also risen 40% so far in 2021 and show strong momentum as we close out the year. EnLink Midstream LLC (ENLC) A $3 billion pipeline company, ENLC is a ""midstream"" energy business that is involved in the transportation, processing and storage of natural gas. It operates approximately 11,900 miles of pipelines, 22 natural gas processing plants, barges, rail terminals, trucks and more. EnLink is among the top performing companies on Wall Street this year thanks to its unique business operations that are insulated from direct energy price swings and should benefit from an increase in demand. The result is a big dividend and big gains of more than 60% in 2021, which means strong momentum could follow in the new year as well. EPR Properties (EPR) EPR is another REIT like Chimera. However, this is indeed a more traditional real estate firm as it operates commercial properties under a ""triple-net lease"" structure -- meaning the tenants are on the hook for rent, but also have to take care of utilities, taxes, upkeep and similar expenses out of their own pockets. EPR serves the entertainment industry with facilities including ski resorts, theaters and amusement parks among the tenants that make up its nearly $7 billion portfolio across 44 states. While there's admittedly some uncertainty around these businesses thanks to the omicron variant, the 35% gains year to date for EPR hint that investors are not expecting operations to fall apart anytime soon. And as the tenants keep paying their rent, this dividend stock will keep paying its shareholders. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) Big Oil was decidedly out of favor in the last few years, but Exxon has come back with a vengeance in 2021 for two big reasons. The obvious one is that rising energy prices alongside rising global oil and gas demand have delivered big results, with revenue set to rise more than 60% over the prior year. But it's also worth noting that Exxon's big investments in greener alternatives to fossil fuels are starting to bear fruit, including its Strathcona renewable diesel project that is part of plans to provide more than 40,000 barrels per day of low-emissions fuels by 2025. Shares remain well off their highs of almost $90 back in 2017 despite the recent run, however, and investors can still enjoy a tremendous dividend yield as shares trade at a relative discount. Lumen Technologies Inc. (LUMN) Previously known as Century Link, Lumen boasts some 4.6 million broadband internet subscribers and a legacy business of phone landlines that against all odds continue to generate a decent amount of cash. That's because some rural areas still suffer from unreliable service. Lumen has done its best to expand and stay relevant beyond this old-school telecom network, including a host of acquisitions that have targeted digital services -- chief among these being a $25 billion deal for internet service provider Level 3 in 2016. It may not be as big as giants such as AT&T Inc. (T) or Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), but Lumen still has something to offer dividend investors in 2022. Prospect Capital Corp. (PSEC) Recently making an appearance in U.S. News as one of the best monthly dividend stocks, Prospect Capital is a triple threat with a big-time distribution, monthly dividends and a tremendous 2021 gain of roughly 50% this year. Things are looking up for the beginning of 2022, too, with strong fiscal first-quarter earnings posted at the beginning of November, including a big earnings beat and robust investment income. Operating almost like a publicly traded version of a private equity fund, PSEC profits by investing in small- and mid-sized companies across a wide array of industries. Those investments have paid off as the economy has been on the upswing this year, and there's reason to expect that performance to continue going forward. Sunoco LP (SUN) As a major distributor of retail motor fuels in the U.S., Sunoco is a recognizable brand with a value proposition that speaks for itself. Yes, there is an increased focus on electric vehicles -- but EVs are a tiny fraction of the cars on the road, and hundreds of millions of Americans still have to get to work and the store the old-fashioned way: with a combustion engine. Sunoco also cashes in on food service and novelty sales at its branded convenience stores, as well as offering distribution that connects independent refiners with local partner stations. It's not a glamorous business, but it's a reliable one -- meaning solid dividends that investors can take to the bank. 9 high-yield dividend stocks to buy for 2022: -- AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB) -- Camping World Holdings Inc.

12/23/2021,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Krystal Hu (Reuters) - Jose Castillo pulled his $60,000 worth of GameStop Corp shares from his brokerage last summer, even though he had no intention of selling them. The 26-year-old information technology worker, who lives in the greater Minneapolis area, is among a growing number of investors in ""meme"" stocks -- shares such as GameStop popular with day traders -- who are withdrawing them from brokerages out of concern the shares will be lent to hedge funds engaging in short-selling. Castillo pulled the shares out of Fidelity Investments and transferred them to his name using Computershare Ltd, an Australian stock transfer company. Brokerages have been trying to reassure investors that they only lend shares of customers who are trading on borrowed funds. If they use their own cash, the shares are not loaned. Castillo traded GameStop shares without using borrowed funds, but he still feared his shares would be lent. He said he read about the ""direct registration"" of shares on Reddit, the social media platform that day traders turned to this year after the meme stock trading frenzy took off. There, more and more investors have announced they have taken their shares out of brokerages through companies such as Computershare, arguing this will help shield them from short-selling. ""There is so much going on with a stock being shorted, people started to think how can I make sure that I own it and that somebody else isn't doing anything that I don't want with it,"" Castillo said in an interview. A Fidelity spokesperson declined to comment. Paul Conn, president of Computershare's global capital markets group, said he saw a wave of direct registration business starting in September that was driven by day traders. ""Retail investors have asked their broker or bank to remove their investments from the 'street name' system and into their own name, directly onto the company's share register,"" Conn said. Hedge funds short shares by borrowing and selling them, hoping they will drop in value so they can buy them back for less and pocket the difference. Financial market experts said the push towards direct registration was unlikely to curtail this practice, because most hedge funds' collateral comes from prime brokers rather than retail brokerages. ""The shares used to stock-loan from margined retail accounts are minimal compared to the stock-loan inventory from prime brokers and long lenders such as mutual funds and pension funds,"" said research firm S3 Partners managing director Ihor Dusaniwsky. Monthly average trading volumes of GameStop shares have dropped since July to their lowest levels for more than a year, according to Refinitiv data. That was about the time that Reddit users began to advocate for the direct registration of shares. The more shares are transferred out of brokerages into direct registration providers such as Computershare, the fewer of them are available to trade.Joshua Mitts, a securities law professor at Columbia Law School, said removing shares from the market makes them more susceptible to wild price swings, which could end up hurting the retail investors. ""From a psychological point of view, I can see how that resonates. But from an economic point of view it does not make much sense, because with fewer shares available the trading is simply going to become more volatile,"" Mitts said. A GameStop spokesperson declined to comment. Popular trading apps such as Robinhood Markets Inc and SoFi Technologies Inc, as well traditional brokerages such as Charles Schwab Corp and Fidelity, would lose out if the direct registration trend intensified. They benefited from this year's surge in trading of meme stocks. Robinhood and Charles Schwab representatives reiterated that only shares of customers who have borrowed from the brokerages to invest are loaned to hedge funds. ""We have seen an uptick in recent months of clients requesting to hold certain securities outside of Charles Schwab as a means to prevent them from being lent out,"" the brokerage's managing director of trading and education, Jeff Chiappetta, said in a statement. Many requests were made by clients who bought shares without borrowing from Charles Schwab and would not have had their shares lent, Chiappetta added. A SoFi spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. TRADING CURBS Retail investors started to mistrust brokerages when Robinhood and its peers placed trading restrictions in late January on GameStop's shares. Thousands of investors claimed on social media that the trading curbs were introduced to protect hedge funds that had lost billions of dollars shorting the stock without anticipating a Reddit-fueled rally. Commission-free brokerages such as Robinhood rely on payment for order flow, under which they receive fees from market makers for routing trades to them. This business model has also made retail investors suspicious, especially since Citadel Securities, which acts as Robinhood's market maker, also runs hedge funds that engage in short-selling. Robinhood and Citadel have insisted that the trading restrictions were not put in place to protect hedge funds, but were needed because Robinhood did not have enough collateral to execute customers' trades. A U.S. judge sided with Robinhood on the matter last month, dismissing an investor lawsuit accusing the trading app and other brokerages of wrongly preventing retail investors from buying fast-rising ""meme stocks"" and triggering a sell-off.
