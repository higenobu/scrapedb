5/20/2022,"The US House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has warned that unilateral UK legislation affecting the Northern Ireland protocol could endanger British prospects for a free trade deal with the US. Pelosi’s bluntly worded intervention came two days after the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, confirmed that the government was planning to table legislation that would nullify parts of the protocol by exempting some goods moving between Great Britain and Ireland from EU customs checks. Pelosi made clear that she viewed the protocol as essential to maintaining the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement which minimised border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Northern Ireland protocol was the outcome of negotiations with the EU on how to keep the frictionless border between the Irelands and maintain EU customs boundaries after Brexit. “As I have stated in my conversations with the prime minister, the foreign secretary and members of the House of Commons, if the United Kingdom chooses to undermine the Good Friday accords, the Congress cannot and will not support a bilateral free trade agreement with the United Kingdom,” the Speaker said in a written statement. The EU has already warned of a potential trade war if the UK moves ahead with its legislation. “It is deeply concerning that the United Kingdom now seeks to unilaterally discard the Northern Ireland protocol, which preserves the important progress and stability forged by the accords. It continues to enjoy strong bipartisan and bicameral support in the United States Congress,” Pelosi added. The warning follows a visit to Washington by the prime minister’s newly appointed special envoy for the Northern Ireland protocol in the US, Conor Burns, to explain the UK position to the Biden administration and to Congress, which is to blame the EU for inflexibility. US officials were irritated however that Burns, having emphasised his close personal relationship with Boris Johnson, had not warned them that Johnson was about to visit Northern Ireland. Burns assured them that no decisions had been made on whether to pursue new legislation, days before Truss made her announcement. “Respectful of the will of the British people and of Brexit, I urge constructive, collaborative and good-faith negotiations to implement an agreement that upholds peace,” Pelosi wrote on Thursday evening. “The children of Northern Ireland, who have never known the bloody conflict and do not want to go back, deserve a future free of the violence where all may reach their fulfillment.”",News/US news,Pelosi warns changes to Northern Ireland protocol could affect US trade deal with Britain,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/20/pelosi-warns-changes-to-northern-ireland-protocol-could-affect-us-trade-deal-with-britain
5/20/2022,"Australians head to the polls on Saturday with the opposition Labor party, led by Anthony Albanese, hoping to end nine years of conservative rule. The Liberal-National coalition government, headed by Scott Morrison, goes into the election with 75 MPs in the 151-seat House of Representatives, one short of the majority needed to govern without crossbench support. Labor has been ahead in opinion polls since the campaign began, but the lead has narrowed in the final week of the campaign, and the party is haunted by its failure at the last election, in 2019, when the polls wrongly suggested it would win. The six-week election campaign has largely been an attritional slog between two uninspiring leaders, but enlivened by high-profile independent candidates and minor parties challenging the offerings of the government and opposition. Morrison’s Liberal party has come under pressure in formerly safe inner-city seats, which have been targeted by grassroots campaigns backed by millions of dollars in donations from the lobby group Climate 200 and supporting, almost exclusively, female candidates. The independents are running on a platform of stronger action to address the climate crisis, establishing a national anti-corruption body and addressing gender inequality, all areas where Morrison’s government is seen as weak. Despite the push by the independents and the Greens to put global heating on the agenda, neither major party has committed to strong climate action. The coalition committed, after much reluctance from the rural-based National party, to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, but includes new gas projects in its technology-led recovery. Three weeks into the campaign a Nationals senator, Matt Canavan, declared the net zero ambition “all over bar the shouting”. Labor presented a modest plan hinged on building more efficient transmission lines and reducing industrial emissions, which has been supported by the business lobby as at least representing some steps towards a credible policy. Among the seats targeted by independent campaigns is Kooyong, the inner-city Melbourne seat held by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. Government MPs in target areas, including Frydenberg, have attempted to distance themselves from the unpopular Morrison and instead called in the conservative former prime minister John Howard to campaign extensively in an attempt to keep their seats. If even a few independent candidates are successful it could result in a hung parliament, the first since 2010. In the upper house, where minor parties have a better chance of election and overall majorities are rare, the Greens hope to gain three seats, which would bring the party’s Senate team to 12. Morrison has focused his campaign on electorates in the outer suburbs and regional cities that have traditionally been held by Labor, in what has been described as an emulation of the “red wall” strategy employed by Boris Johnson in the 2019 UK election. He has shaped his pitch for re-election on the government’s record in getting Australia through the Covid-19 pandemic with the economy intact and without significant loss of life in the first two years. This year, however, Australia has experienced one of the highest Covid transmission rates per capita in the world, with 5,633 deaths since the start of 2022, compared with 2,239 in 2020 and 2021 combined. Morrison said in the last week of the campaign that there was no need for further public health measures to reverse this trend. Morrison promised to change the way he governed if re-elected, admitting to being “a bit of a bulldozer”. Albanese has campaigned largely on the platform of not being Scott Morrison. “This government has been there for almost a decade, this prime minister had four years in office, and what he’s saying is ‘if you vote for Scott Morrison, I’ll change’ … well, if you want change, change the government,” Albanese said. The Labor leader, who was the manager of government business in the 2010-13 parliament, the most legislatively productive in Australia’s history despite Labor having no majority, said he was a “builder” to Morrison’s bulldozer. “A bulldozer wrecks things. A bulldozer knocks things over. I’m a builder, that’s what I am. I will build things in this country,” he said. Albanese suffered early from repeated gaffes, including his failure to name the cash rate (the central bank interest rate) or the employment rate on the opening day of the campaign, leading to repeated criticism from Morrison and the Murdoch press, particularly Sky News, that he was not across policy detail. He contracted Covid two weeks into the campaign and spent a week in isolation. Both major parties have focused on the cost of living, as Australia faces a housing affordability crisis, the first rise in the cash rate since 2010, and wages growing at half the inflation rate. Labor has promised to support wage increases for low-paid workers, address the gender wage gap, boost manufacturing, and introduce a $392m housing equity scheme that would allow the government to provide a contribution of up to 40% of the purchase price of a new home. Albanese said he would support a minimum wage increase of 5.1%, in line with inflation, which would amount to about $1 an hour for workers on the minimum wage. Morrison called that “incredibly reckless” and said such a rise “would force small businesses potentially out of business all together”. “Anthony Albanese is a loose unit on the economy,” Morrison said. The coalition then announced its own plan to address the extreme housing affordability crisis, which would allow Australians to access their superannuation to buy their first home, a move experts say would increase house prices and shrink the retirement savings of millions of Australians. Neither party has backed an increase in Australia’s unemployment benefits, which are below the poverty line, and they remain in lockstep on Australia’s hardline policies on asylum seekers.",News/Australia news,Australian election: voters to go to polls in battle of ‘bulldozer’ and ‘builder’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/australian-election-voters-polls-scott-morrison-bulldozer-anthony-albanese-builder
5/20/2022,"One of Melbourne’s Aboriginal heritage councils is facing a race against the clock, in a bid to stop two culturally significant artworks being lost to Australia when they go under the hammer at Sotheby’s New York auction house next week. The two works – an earth pigment and charcoal on paper painting, and a carved hardwood parrying shield – were created by William Barak, a pivotal Wurundjeri ngurungaeta (leader), negotiator and artist in the mid to late 1800s. The Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Corporation has launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to buy the works at auction and return them to Australia, having only learned of the artefacts’ impending auction in late April. The auction is scheduled for 25 May. A Wurundjeri elder and Barak descendent, Uncle Ron Jones, told Guardian Australia that the works should be classified as national treasures. “Whether the government’s Liberal or Labor, state or federal, it should be governments’ responsibility, [these works] are part of our history and should be protected,” he said. “We were wholly impacted [by colonisation] in virtually a similar way Tasmania was devastated. Let’s try and preserve some of our history and bring it back home.” The 1897 painting titled Corroboree (Women in possum skin cloaks), has an estimated value of about A$500,000 according to the Sotheby’s online catalogue, while the shield has an estimate of about $35,000. However, the Wurundjeri Corporation chief executive, Gwyneth Elsum said it had been advised as much as $1m might need to be raised to secure successful bids at auction. “We don’t know exactly how much they will both go for, so we’ve just put in our estimate,” she said. “As we get closer to the auction, we will have a better sense of what they’ll actually go for.” Elsum said the corporation wrote to Victoria’s Aboriginal affairs minister, Gabrielle Williams, on 22 April, seeking a meeting to discuss how the state government could assist in bringing the artworks home. A meeting has not been set. In a statement, a spokesperson for the minister said that, under the Aboriginal Heritage Act, Victoria is only responsible for the repatriation of ancestral remains and sacred objects to their rightful owners within the state. “The commonwealth government has responsibility for the protection and repatriation of significant cultural objects from overseas as part of the national heritage of all Australians,” the spokesperson said. Barak is one of the Wurundjeri clan’s most revered historical figures and a key player in negotiations between Indigenous Australians and Europeans in and around Melbourne (Narrm) in the 19th century. As a teenager, he witnessed the meeting between his father, uncles and other Wurundjeri elders that resulted in John Batman acquiring much of the land that became the cities of Melbourne and Geelong. Barak spent much of his life peacefully fighting against this dispossession, employing written petitions, diplomacy and negotiating skills. Th La Trobe University lecturer Nikita Vanderbyl, who completed her PhD thesis on Barak, said the two works were either bought by the Swiss grazier and agriculturalist Baron Frédéric Guillaume de Pury, or offered to the de Pury family by Barak as a gift or form of cultural exchange. The de Pury family had extensive land holdings in the Coranderrk region, where the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people, part of the larger Kulin nation, had relocated following European encroachment. “The way I would describe the friendship is that it emerged out of almost necessity, because during this period of colonisation nothing was really fixed,” she said. “Barak was bringing his family into [de Pury’s] world as much as they were bringing him into theirs … he was using this friendship as a way to maintain contact with his country. There are strong indications that that friendship resulted in other artworks that are now in the de Pury’s Swiss collection at Neuchatel.” The Australian arm of the de Pury family donated its extensive Barak archives to the Yarra Ranges Regional Museum about a decade ago. Sandra de Pury, who still owns and operates the Yeringberg wine estate in the Yarra Valley her ancestors established, told the Guardian her family was not close to the European-based de Purys, and that they had not made contact about the Barak works. “We would love to see them come back to Australia, but short of donating to GoFundMe, which I fully intend to do, it’s a substantial amount of money,” de Pury said. Jones said his ancestor gave many paintings as gifts to people he respected. “The painting tells the story of his people, his culture and his history,” he said, of Corroboree. “He would have only given it to a special friend … as far as I’m concerned, that family has no right to make hundreds of thousands of dollars from something that was gifted to them.” It was only long after Barak’s death in 1903 that his artistic career was widely recognised. Much of his art now sits in museums and galleries across Australia. An exhibition commemorating his life was staged at the National Gallery of Victoria in 2003. Two years later, the William Barak bridge was constructed in Melbourne, and he was placed on the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Roll in 2011. This is not the first time the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Corporation has resorted to crowdfunding in an attempt to repatriate a Barak work. In 2016, Bonhams sold his painting Ceremony for A$512,400. The corporation did not raise enough funds to outbid the successful buyer, an anonymous private collector. Its whereabouts are now unknown.",Arts/Art and design,‘Bring them home’: Australian crowdfund campaign seeks to buy Wurundjeri art at New York auction,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/20/bring-them-home-australian-crowdfund-campaign-seeks-to-buy-wurundjeri-art-at-new-york-auction
5/20/2022,"You don’t have to look far to find a frustrated Essendon fan in Melbourne/Narrm right now, myself included. Mention the club’s name at the pub and you’re bound to get a reception of either pity, frustration or anguish. Hyped before the season started, the men’s side have had a dismal run of 2022 so far and are now cemented in the bottom four on the ladder, having notched just two wins from nine games. Essendon greats are weighing in. Matthew Lloyd says “they are being walked all over” while Tim Watson claims the players are “on notice”. And it is looking like getting worse before it gets better as the Bombers face top eight opponents Richmond, Carlton and St Kilda in the coming weeks, and then a showdown with a dangerous-looking Port Adelaide currently placed 10th. In this sense, it is a trying time to wear the Dons scarf. Skipper Dyson Heppell confirmed on Monday night when fronting the media to say, “we absolutely [are] hurting inside and disappointed”. As a member, I can tell you the heartbreak and exasperation is real. It’s even now at the point where the ‘Essendon haven’t won a final in how many years?’ jokes from supporters of rival clubs have abated, as many look on with genuine sympathy for the red and black fanbase. However, when I think about Essendon, there is also excitement and hope in my chest. That’s why I dispute the AFL media’s chief correspondent Damian Barrett’s claim this week on AFL Daily that: “I’m not seeing anything positive out of this club at the moment”. Because for the many who have waited their entire lives to see a women’s team run out in the club’s famous red sash at the highest level, something positive is just mere months away from becoming a reality. Each week, news drops of the latest signings for the AFLW team the Bombers are building. It’s all looking very hopeful, as the club pinches fan favourites from rivals, such as Carlton’s Georgia Gee and Maddy Prespakis, Western Bulldog Bonnie Toogood, Fremantle’s Steph Cain and Collingwood’s Sophie Alexander – all of them league best and fairest winners for their former clubs. Adding to this optimism is the current Essendon VFLW team, who are already guaranteed a finals berth and currently sit undefeated at the top of the table with a mammoth percentage of 415.3. These Bombers have been winning games by around 40+ points each week – except for a recent tie with Hawthorn and another with St Kilda earlier in the season – and they thrashed Collingwood by 73 points in the Anzac Day round, the same weekend the men’s team lost by 11 points. Many of the players in this VFLW squad will be part of the Essendon AFLW team, including co-captain Georgia Nanscawen, Joanna Doonan, Danielle Marshall, Jordan Zanchetta and Federica Frew. It’s hard to watch “Freds” bag goal after goal on the weekend and not daydream about what that is going to look like at AFLW level. So it is a strange time to be an Essendon supporter. The heartbreak and disappointment tied to the men’s season mixes with the excitement and anticipation for the women’s team, who are looking like causing a real stir in the competition come August. Within my sports community, fans are every bit as invested in AFLW as much as AFLM. It means many are offering each other a shoulder after a 60-point loss to the men’s team on a Saturday night and then sharing a knowing nod on Sunday morning when the women’s team win by around the same margin. While Twitter is loudly asking, “What’s going on over at The Hangar?” and bemoaning the slump the men have found themselves in again, the same question is being asked about the women’s program, only with a polar opposite tone. This conflict of emotions tied to the same club is something my father can relate to. His Adelaide fandom has seen him sighing loudly watching the men’s team these last few years. And yet whenever he’s asked about the Crows, he proudly boasts they’ve won three out of the five AFLW premierships so far. My mum, a St George supporter in the NRL, has done the same, cheering for the Dragons’ NRLW side as the men in the Red V continue to disappoint, on and off field. I guess that’s what being a true supporter is all about: the highs and lows, even if they’re happening at the same time. So to any disheartened Bombers supporters who just want to see a convincing Essendon win, I recommend heading down to see the VFL women play. When it comes to the football club’s future, there’s something brilliant being built there.",Sport/Sport,These are strange times to follow Essendon but new AFLW team can buoy fans | Marnie Vinall,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/these-are-strange-times-to-follow-essendon-but-new-aflw-team-can-buoy-fans
5/20/2022,"Queenslander Jason Kubler is celebrating the perfect birthday present after completing his own personal grand slam. The one-time world No 1 junior, who has been beset by injury woes in the senior ranks, said it felt “unreal” to make the French Open main draw at Roland Garros, thus completing his set of playing in all four majors. On his 29th birthday, getting through the gruelling ordeal of the qualifying tournament on the red clay in Paris was another sign that the former wunderkind is enjoying a late-career renaissance. Kubler defeated Portugal’s Pedro Sousa 7-5, 6-2 in the third round and became the only Australian man to qualify this year. “Feels unreal. This was the last slam where I hadn’t played a main draw,” he said. “Luckily, I got a wildcard into Aussie, and then another into US and then I qualified for Wimby, so it’s nice to have qualified for another one. I guess just this year for me, in general, has been a pretty good one.” It started on a high when he reached the mixed doubles final at the Australian Open with Jaimee Fourlis and continued with a couple of victories in lower-level events in Canberra. He put the lucrative pay day from the Melbourne final to good use. “That really set me up for the year and I could start investing myself with coaching and some sort of support along the road,” he said. “Just the exact same thing with this tournament now, I can really start to plan things, have a lot more people around me. Always makes it a bit easier with all the travel and stuff like that. If anything, it’s just more money now that I can invest in myself.” Getting through to the first round of the main draw will guarantee Kubler at least 62,000 euros ($93,000) to further fund his revival. But he will have to wait until all the other qualifiers have been completed on Friday to learn who his first-round opponent will be. Potential nightmarish opponents first up for him in the draw could be luminaries like Alexander Zverev, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Carlos Alcaraz. “Obviously I’d love to win as many rounds as I could but, to be honest, I just want to play people where I learn things about myself,” he said. “If I play any of the big names, win or lose, I’m going to learn what I need to improve, learn what type of player I am, maybe experience some pretty cool moments. Winning a couple of rounds, that’d be nice, but anything that comes my way, I’ll try my best and hopefully learn from it.” Kubler could be joined as a qualifier by compatriot Seone Mendez, who has never been in any grand slam women’s main draw but will have a shot in Friday’s third-round match against Canadian Rebecca Marino.",Sport/Sport,Comeback kid Jason Kubler storms into French Open main draw,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/19/comeback-kid-kubler-storms-home-in-quest-for-french-open-dream
5/20/2022,"A single issue is likely to swing some voters in at least three marginal seats in Brisbane this Saturday – and it is one that could prove fatal for both Liberal National and Labor party incumbents. It is not the economy nor the climate crisis, though these will no doubt matter to many other voters. Aircraft noise has become the defining local political issue for many of those who live under flightpaths since the day Brisbane airport opened its second runway in mid-2020. Anger among those affected is white-hot, well-organised and is leading some rusted-on voters from both major parties to switch their votes to the Greens. The minor party is promising a curfew and cap on flights, as well as changes to flightpaths which would send more planes over Moreton Bay. The LNP also announced it would “rip up and redraw” Brisbane’s flightpaths last month, although Brisbane Flight Path Community Alliance chair, David Diamond, said some held a “natural cynicism” about that promise, given that the government had been brought “kicking and screaming” to the position on the eve of the election. Labor says it will deliver a white paper to address aircraft noise and airport planning, a promise that has failed to salve the burning resentment some residents now hold against both parties. Diamond said some felt “misled” by the way the billion-dollar runway project had been managed. “So there’s an integrity issue now as well,” he said. An IT consultant and small businessman who lives in the riverside suburb of Bulimba in the electorate of Griffith, Alex Proctor, said he would normally be focused on the “big-hitter” issues of health, childcare, housing, education and the environment, and typically voted Labor. But the 43-year-old father of two said his fears of increased aircraft noise meant his “only choice” at this election was to vote Greens. “I’ve never voted Greens in my life,” he said. The LNP, too, seems destined to lose some voters, although toxic online debates mean many do not want to be publicly identified. One who lives in the neighbouring suburb of Balmoral said he was a rusted-on LNP supporter of 50 years. The man, who said he had done “pretty well” out of the resources industry, said the government had done a “reasonable job” nationally, and he didn’t trust Labor with the economy – the issue upon which he would normally vote. “There are a hell of a lot of people out there hurting physically and mentally who are afraid to speak up,” he said. “Voting for the Greens is a private protest of anonymity.” Both these voters live in Griffith, which is held by Labor’s Terri Butler on a margin of 2.9%. In 2019 the LNP’s Olivia Roberts won the highest number of first-preference votes, 40.97%, compared with Butler’s 30.95%, and came second after preferences were distributed. The Greens’ Max Chandler-Mather garnered a swing of 6.67% to win 23.65% last time and is hopeful of snatching the seat. Chandler-Mather has run what the party describes as its largest door-knocking and listening campaign yet. His team picked up on the “huge” significance of aircraft noise early last year. “I would say it’s probably one of, if not the biggest, local issue,” Chandler-Mather said. “In Griffith, it is not an overstatement to say there are thousands of new people voting for the Greens because of flight noise.” Questions to Butler were directed to Labor’s campaign headquarters. A Labor spokesperson accused the Greens of making “empty promises they know they will never have to deliver” and said the LNP had “only discovered noise is an issue 10 minutes before an election”. Roberts was also contacted for comment. The issue has also proved a flashpoint on the other side of the river in the seat of Brisbane, which is held by the LNP’s Trevor Evans on a margin of 4.9%. Brisbane is seen as a three-horse race, with the Greens candidate, Stephen Bates, likely to pick up protest votes because of the flightpath noise. Evans was contacted for comment and responded with a statement that said he talked with constituents affected by “excessive and unreasonable” aircraft noise “every day”, and that the government had “responded decisively to this problem”. Aircraft noise could also prove a factor in Ryan, held by the LNP on a margin of 6%. The Brisbane Airport Corporation said it did not support curfews but backed changing flightpaths over Moreton Bay. Susan Harris Rimmer, who teaches human rights and public policy at Griffith University, also lives in Griffith and said her letterbox was crammed with material about flight noise. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She agreed the issue would “play out best for the Greens” and acknowledged that the noise was distressing for those who lived where planes fly low. But Harris Rimmer said there was a bigger picture that was being lost in the debate, citing a Climate Council report which places both Brisbane and Griffith in the top 10 federal electorates most at risk from climate change by 2030. “If people think that their amenity is affected by [aircraft noise], just wait till they see how their amenity is affected by the climate impacts that are coming,” she said. “That is a serious issues for those suburbs, and who is talking about it?”",News/Australia news,Anger over aircraft noise expected to boost Greens’ election chances in Brisbane,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/anger-over-aircraft-noise-expected-to-boost-greens-election-chances-in-brisbane
5/20/2022,"The AFL grand final will stick to its usual afternoon time slot at the MCG as the 2022 premiership flag decider returns to Melbourne for the first time in two years, in a win for traditionalists who were resistant to the idea of shifting the start time by two hours. In an acknowledgment of broad fan sentiment, this year’s showpiece event on 24 September will begin at 2:30pm AEST, after the last two grand finals were forced interstate by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and played later in the day. Last year’s decider – a twilight start at Perth’s Optus Stadium – was considered a roaring success, while the 2020 game was a night fixture played at the Gabba in Brisbane. But recent polling of fans had indicated a prevailing preference for an afternoon start – an AFL Fans Association survey revealed 79.9% wanted an afternoon start, while 17.3% preferred a twilight game and just 2.8% a night clash. The AFL’s chief executive Gillon McLachlan said the league appreciated the success of last year’s match in Perth, but a return to normality post-Covid restrictions was the deciding factor. “Prior to the start of this season, we emphasised that after two really challenging years, we all yearned to return to the footy rituals and routines that set the rhythms of our lives, to continue to focus on getting back to football and going to football as we know it,” McLachlan said in a statement. “That return-to-rituals principle underpinned our decision making in ratifying a traditional start time – the prestige, nostalgia and atmosphere of the day grand final is something we all know and love. “Our role is to deliver fans the best possible game experience, whether that be at the match or the millions watching the broadcast, and together with our broadcast partner the Seven Network, we remain committed to creating an amazing event, and seeing 100,000 fans return to the MCG on that last Saturday in September.” AFL Fans Association president Cheryl Critchley said the 2:30pm start was part of the game’s unique tradition and thanked the AFL for respecting “the preference of most fans” by returning the game to its usual time slot. “Polls have long shown that most supporters prefer a day game, and this sentiment has strengthened since we had a night grand final in 2020,” Critchley said. “Most fans have made sacrifices throughout the pandemic, including paying good money for memberships they could not use for extended periods. It’s great to see that loyalty rewarded. “Let’s hope this tradition continues.”",Sport/Sport,AFL grand final to return to traditional time slot at MCG in win for fans,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/afl-grand-final-to-return-to-traditional-time-slot-at-mcg-in-win-for-fans
