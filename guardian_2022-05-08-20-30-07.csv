5/8/2022,"House of Ife begins in mourning, as three siblings come together after their brother’s funeral. What follows is an engrossing family drama of guilty secrets and past trauma which swings from tearfulness to lightness and then back to grief. The backstory seeps out slowly; that the siblings’ late brother, Ife, was a drug addict not yet 30, that their father Solomon (Jude Akuwudike) left their mother, Meron (Sarah Priddy), in north London to start up a second family back home in Ethiopia, and that there is unfinished business between this absent father and his children. Beru Tessema’s script is richly textured and artfully written, although the story seems to waver in its focus for too long and then throws out too much at the end. There are big switches in tone, too, and it is testimony to Lynette Linton’s direction and the actors themselves that the shifts in register work so smoothly. We only ever see the family at home; the narrow traverse stage (set design by Frankie Bradshaw) feels intimate but never claustrophobic. The drama is particularly strong in drawing out the love, warmth and complexity of sibling relationships. The scenes between them dramatise guilt, grief and cultural tensions. “I wish I had known him before the drugs,” says the youngest brother, Yosi (Michael Workeye), while Ife’s twin, Aida (Karla-Simone Spence), seems swallowed up by guilt: “I should never have let him get like that.” Meanwhile, Tsion (Yohanna Ephrem), speaks of the emotional burden of having an addict in the family: “He used to come here off his face.” This is a powerful statement for its focus on those who witness addiction at close quarters rather than experience it, so it is a shame that it is left hanging. The performances paste over the script’s cracks and every actor is engaging and assured. Workeye brings excellent comic timing to Yosi, the lovably cheeky wannabe rapper, while Spence is compelling as Aida, although she occasionally speaks in sentences that sound wooden in their lyricism. Priddy brings a heartstopping moment of maternal grief at the start; and Akuwudike is both disarmingly charming as the father and unbendingly didactic in his biblical homilies. The climax of the play brings several buried secrets in a single scene. Late-coming revelations around sexuality, childhood abuse and financial betrayal seem too much like plot-points that might have become bigger, more impactful discussions if given room to be developed and unpicked. Even so, this play is an absorbing one that showcases a wealth of talent, and its greatest shortcoming is that we are left, at the end, wanting more.

5/8/2022,"Two Palestinians believed to have killed three people in a terrorist attack on Israel’s independence day – the latest incident in the worst wave of attacks in Israel in years – have been apprehended by police after a three-day manhunt. The suspects, identified as As’ad Yousef As’ad al-Rifa’i, 19, Subhi Emad Subhi Abu Shqeir, 20, both from the occupied West Bank village of Rumana, were caught near a quarry outside the town of Elad in central Israel on Sunday, according to a statement by Israel’s police, military and internal security agency. A massive search to locate the pair had been under way since Thursday night, when two attackers armed with an axe and knife stabbed people during independence day celebrations in Elad, an ultra-Orthdox town. Israeli media identified those killed as Yonatan Havakuk, Boaz Gol and Oren Ben Yiftah, fathers in their 30s and 40s who together are survived by 16 children. Four more people were injured. Ben Yiftah, a driver, was hired to pick up the assailants near a breach in Israel’s West Bank security fence without knowing they had crossed the barrier illegally, Israeli officials said last week. On arrival in Elad, they killed him before moving on to target passersby. The perpetrators then fled the scene, sparking a huge search operation involving special forces, commando units, drones and helicopters, before they surrendered to masked soldiers in a rugged patch of land outside the town early on Sunday. A spate of deadly street attacks targeting Israelis, accompanied by violent clashes at al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police, have sent tensions soaring in recent weeks. Eighteen Israelis, including an Arab-Israeli police officer and two Ukrainian nationals, have been killed in five separate incidents. Three Arab-Israelis and 27 Palestinians have died during the same period, among them an unarmed woman and two apparent bystanders as well as the perpetrators of attacks. The Palestinian casualties were mostly killed by Israeli security forces in stepped-up army operations in the occupied West Bank. The recent escalation has raised fears of another armed conflict similar to the 11-day war a year ago between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which was in part triggered by unrest at al-Aqsa, a site holy to both Jews and Muslims. Informally, Jews are allowed to visit but not pray at the site. In recent years, however, growing numbers of Jewish visitors, sometimes praying with police escorts, have inflamed longstanding Palestinian fears that Israel plans to annex the area. The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, told his cabinet on Sunday that the country was entering a “new stage in the war on terror” and said Israel was establishing a civilian national guard that would be deployed in emergency situations like the kinds of attacks the country has witnessed in recent weeks. “The Israeli government’s main goal is to restore personal security to Israeli citizens,” he said. Bennet will also convene his security cabinet this week to discuss Israel’s options in responding to the latest incident and incitement from Hamas. All of the recent attacks on Israeli soil appear to have been committed by individuals or small groups acting without coordination from larger organisations. Hamas leaders praised Thursday’s events in Elad, but did not claim responsibility. The Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth reported on Sunday that officials were considering restricting the entry of Gazan workers into Israel and mending the hundreds of holes in the West Bank separation barrier that thousands of Palestinians use to access illegal work in Israel. Aware of the economic pressures facing Palestinian society, and benefiting from the cheap labour, Israel had until recently been turning a blind eye to the illegal crossings from the West Bank.",News/World news,Israeli police arrest two Palestinians over independence day attack,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/israeli-police-arrest-two-palestinians-over-independence-day-attack
5/8/2022,"The UK government will take “whatever measures are necessary” to reform Northern Ireland’s Brexit protocol, the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, has pledged, amid fears the newly elected Stormont assembly could be put on pause until Christmas. In the wake of a resounding election victory for Sinn Féin, the DUP has said it cannot take up its position as deputy first minister until Brexit checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain are removed. Raab told Sky News on Sunday: “If anything, the outcome in Northern Ireland from those elections makes it clear it [a protocol fix] can’t be put off.” He suggested it would be dealt with in the coming “weeks and months”, warning that stability in Northern Ireland was being “imperilled” by the dispute over the protocol – which was agreed by Boris Johnson’s government as part of the Brexit divorce from the EU in 2019. London’s threat to take action will increase tensions between Westminster and Brussels, with the UK insisting all options remain on the table – including the possibility of unilaterally scrapping elements of the deal. That could trigger a major breakdown in relations between the UK and European Union with Brussels previously threatening a trade war if such unilateral action was taken. The war in Ukraine has switched the political focus across Europe and while talks between UK and European Commission officials have been under way since last October the momentum has stalled. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, last week indicated that the UK would not take immediate legal action over the protocol, saying the UK preferred to resolve the issue through negotiation. Sinn Féin’s historic victory in Northern Ireland has resulted in it overtaking the DUP as the largest party in the state, for the first time since Northern Ireland was formed over 100 years ago. Under a complicated post-conflict power-sharing system, it is entitled to nominate the first minister in the Stormont executive, or cabinet, but that position can be taken up only if the largest party of the unionist side also nominates a deputy first minister. After the counts were completed close to midnight on Saturday night, the party, which supports a united Ireland, had clinched 27 seats three more than the DUP. However, the unionists’ combined number of seats still outnumbers Sinn Féin’s when the nine seats won by the albeit diminished Ulster Unionist party are taken into account. “If you look at the results in Northern Ireland, 58% fully of people voted either for parties who support the union or for parties who do not support constitutional change and that is the message from the people of Northern Ireland,” Raab told Sky News. Overnight, leading members of the British, Irish and US governments urged all sides to respect the democratic will of the people and form the devolved government. Lewis said the “people of Northern Ireland deserve a stable and accountable local government” and that he would be meeting all parties in the coming days. But he too hinted at a move on the protocol, saying: “the electorate delivered a number of messages … they were clear that they want a fully functioning devolved government in Northern Ireland” but also “want the issues around the protocol addressed”. The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said it was “incumbent on all political parties” to deliver their mandate and nominate a first and deputy first minister to enable a fully functioning executive. In the US, congressman Richie Neal, who chairs a powerful committee that would have the final say over a potential UK trade deal, urged all sides to make continuing stability in Northern Ireland a priority. “Now is not the time for hard lines that will diminish this great progress, and any form of triumphalism should be resisted. The preservation of peace and stability remain paramount regardless of the outcome of these elections,” he said in a statement.",News/UK news,"UK will do ‘whatever necessary’ to reform Northern Ireland Brexit protocol, says minister",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/08/uk-will-do-whatever-necessary-to-reform-northern-ireland-brexit-protocol-says-dominic-raab
5/8/2022,"Jorge, a community activist from Colombia’s conflict-ridden Chocó province, was already traveling to the city of Medellín when he heard news that made him turn back towards home. Paramilitary militiamen in balaclavas and military fatigues had thrown up a string of roadblocks and declared an “armed strike”, torching vehicles, forcing businesses to close, and stopping all traffic. “There’s absolutely no one around, because any vehicle they find on the roads they set on fire,” said Jorge, using a false name to avoid any reprisals. “It’s total terror.” Since Thursday, cities, towns and villages across northern Colombia have been shut down by the feared Gulf Clan drug cartel, in retaliation for the extradition to the United States of its former leader, Dairo Antonio Úsuga, better known as Otoniel. Otoniel faces a litany of drug-trafficking charges in the US, as well as over 120 charges in Colombia – including allegations of murder, illegal recruitment, kidnapping for ransom, sexual abuse of minors, terrorism, illegal possession of weapons and drug trafficking. But even as prosecutors in New York boasted that the alleged kingpin would finally face justice, Colombians across a swath of the country remained hostage to the terror unleashed by his thousands of henchmen. Militiamen have blocked main roads and forbidden everyone to venture out, even to buy food. “Everything has been shut down since midday on Thursday, practically every single business is now closed,” said one resident in Apartadó, a city of 200,000 people in the Urabá region, where the Gulf Clan still holds territory. “We don’t know how long this will go on. The water and power keeps going out, there’s no transport, and food is running low. We just have to wait and see what happens.” Videos shared by residents with the Guardian show streets that normally teem with commerce were now completely deserted. “The state has no control here, so in any moment armed groups can make trouble and destabilise the entire region,” said one community leader in Montería, the capital of the province of Córdoba. “Entire municipalities are shut down, buses have been burned, and nobody can leave their homes.” A threatening flyer in the name of the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AGC) – the name the cartel uses for itself – have been distributed in several towns, stating that the armed strike will last for four days, and that the cartel will not be held responsible for the “consequences that could be unfavourable”. Shops, schools and government buildings were graffitied with the AGC’s insignia. “We are the prisoners, not Otoniel,” said another resident of a village in the region. “Everyone is confined to their homes, and nothing – not even an ambulance – moves. This is a silent chaos.” Otoniel’s capture was hailed by US and Colombian authorities as a major blow against narcotraffickers, but police say that two of his lieutenants, known as Gonzalito and Chiquito Malo, have taken command of the militia, which is believed to have as many as 2,000 fighters, and in addition to drug trafficking is also involved in people trafficking, extortion, kidnapping for ransom, and forced recruitment of children. Colombian authorities have responded to the violence by launching an “anti-terrorism policy”, principally aimed at lifting roadblocks. “The instruction to commanders is to deploy all their capabilities, and especially to be on the offensive against these criminals,” said a police spokesperson on Friday morning. Analysts say the terror in northern Colombia is a predictable consequence of the country’s hardline tactics in the “war on drugs”, which often overlook civilian populations living among traffickers. “This is a perfect demonstration of what the problem is with Colombia’s approach to groups like the Clan del Golfo, in the sense that decapitating them with these large-scale, high-profile arrests like that of Otoniel have done nothing to affect the structure of the organisation,” said Elizabeth Dickinson, a Colombia analyst with the International Crisis Group, a thinktank. “The daily reality in regions they control or contest continues to involve high levels of social control, a forced recruitment, coercion, extortion.” “All of that is invisible, but in a moment like this, it becomes impossible for the state to ignore the depth of presence of a group like the Clan del Golfo in this region,” Dickinson said. “It’s actually quite shocking.”",News/World news,‘It’s total terror’: Colombian cartel retaliates over kingpin’s arrest,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/gulf-clan-cartel-armed-strike-colombia-otoniel-dairo-antonio-usuga

Produced by, and starring, father-and-son pairing Anil and Harshvardhan Kapoor – playing a disillusioned cop nearing retirement and a murkily motived antique dealer respectively – Thar favours grit over gloss. The bracingly forthright approach to violence and the earthiness of the dialogue are hallmarks of Indian indie cinema powerhouse Anurag Kashyap, who possesses finely tuned genre instincts and a writing credit on this production. The savage drama of the landscape is evocatively harnessed: this is an unforgiving place, full of hard eyes and secrets, where newcomers are unwelcome. But antique trader Siddharth arrives with money and offers of work, which win the trust of the local people. He also comes with a grudge and a thirst for revenge. Any film that depicts torture this enthusiastically will not be for everyone, but this snarling, feral piece of film-making gets its teeth into the audience and doesn’t let go.

5/8/2022,"Jonny Banger is something of a free spirit with his fingers in many pies. As well as his fashion label Sports Banger, which makes witty slogan T-shirts, sportswear and occasional catwalk fashion collections, he’s started the Heras record label, set up food banks, joined political protests, had a club residency and organised raves and club nights across the UK. He creates a scene around himself, so a variety of people gravitate to him. It’s like Warhol’s Factory but on London’s Seven Sisters Road, and with a better duty of care. Maybe more surprisingly, and closer to home, he also reminds me of William Morris, the Victorian designer and philosopher. Morris was very ambitious for his art and what it could achieve. He believed in the sanctity and centrality of art to everything in his life, that beauty was something that everyone should have and wasn’t just for the rich. Morris was electrified by Marx and became a pioneer socialist, and I think that Jon has that spirit about him. Welcome to the Collectors Edition. We all collect things. Often without noticing. Open a drawer. Rummage in the pockets of your coat. How did that get in there? Other collections are more conscious: books, records, trainers, T-shirts, “likes”… What’s that all about? I have written a book called Good Pop, Bad Pop, which is based around the objects I found in the loft of a house I used to live in. Objects I collected over the course of a lifetime & then left to gather dust in the dark. Why? Am I a hoarder? Or did I think I was laying things away “for a rainy day”? What does the collecting impulse say about us humans? I decided to devote my guest-edit of the Observer’s New Review to investigating this question. Author Olivia Laing met me at the London Library & helped me collect my thoughts on this & a number of other subjects. There’s an article called “The collectors”, which explores different aspects of collecting through interviews with Peter Blake, artist Andy Holden, quilt-maker Loretta Pettway Bennett, digital archivist (& activist) Stephen Ellcock & others. Artist Jeremy Deller meets Jonny Banger, founder of Sports Banger: a rave/fashion/food bank/political activism collective whose latest clothing collection bears the label “The People Deserve Beauty”. Gallerist Sadie Coles sheds light on the motivations of art collectors in our Q&A. Plus there’s Lias Saoudi (of Fat White Family) sharing his cultural highlights in “On my radar”. A collection of domestic objects rendered in papier-mâche in “The grid”. And a birthday shout-out (in cartoon form) to the one & only David Attenborough. I want to thank Jane Ferguson & her team at the Observer for giving me this opportunity & putting everything together so it all makes sense. Julian House designed Good Pop, Bad Pop & also brought his unique graphic sensibility to bear on this edition of the New Review. Mog Yoshihara & Kelly Kiley at Rough Trade Management set up my Zoom conversations with contributors. Jeannette Lee and Kim Sion had excellent suggestions. Raina Lampkins-Fielder introduced me to the work of the Gee’s Bend quilt-makers. Chrissy Blake hosted my interview with Peter Blake. Javi Aznarez drew a wonderful cartoon. Thank you all for your help. Happy Sunday. Love, Jarvis x PS: there’s a playlist of music referred to in Good Pop, Bad Pop – you can get a sneak peek here. In 2019, he invited me to his first fashion show, which was an incredible, chaotic mess that made perfect sense. From then on we kept in touch. In March 2020, the government sent out a form letter to every household explaining what was happening in terms of rules and help for people during the pandemic. Through Instagram and Twitter, Jon asked children across the country to draw on this letter to show how they were feeling. He received a deluge of responses and when I saw them on Instagram, I first thought: why didn’t I think of that? And, second: this would make a great exhibition. In October 2020, we opened The Covid Letters exhibition at London’s Foundling Museum. I feel charmed by Jon as a person and his work is an absolute expression of him as a human being. Jarvis thought his multidisciplinary work would be a good story for the collectors issue, so we visited Jon’s north London studio, known as Maison de Bang Bang.Jeremy Deller Jarvis Cocker: I thought it would be nice to talk to you for this issue, because you make collections of clothes and you also collected the Covid letters. So could we talk and could you educate me? What are the origins of Sports Banger?I grew up in Colchester. My mum was a psychiatric nurse and she got ill with leukaemia when I was 13 and died when I was 15. Then it was just me and my brother in the house. He was 18 and became my guardian. I’d been bootlegging since I was 10 – my dad’s mate ran a sports shop and I’d make hooky T-shirts for myself on the heat press machine or we’d sell loads of sportswear from the warehouse at markets and car boot sales. He went down in the end because all his stock was fake. From doing work experience at a record shop in Colchester I saw from the older kids how to build my escape route: college, get a student loan, go to uni. I did a music production HND at Sussex uni. I didn’t finish, but I put on my own parties in Brighton, started a record label and worked in pirate radio. That’s where the name Jonny Banger comes from. I moved to London around 2008 and worked at a record distribution company as the warehouse kid, surrounded by all the records. Then I was at a venue in east London, where I booked their nights, but when I was 26 I quit. I was so depressed and skint that all I could do was eat noodles. Around that time Tulisa from N-Dubz got nicked. Do you remember that? It was a Fake Sheikh/Sun on Sunday sting – she was arrested on suspicion of supplying class A drugs. So for my birthday I made myself a T-shirt printed with “Free Tulisa”. She was a working-class girl being dragged through the mud by the media. Everyone stopped me when I wore that T-shirt, took photos and talked to me. I could see there was something in it, and after that I started telling the story of my life through my T-shirts. That expanded to become the Sports Banger range. There’s been a lot of chaos, but that’s the thread that joins things together. JC: It’s interesting you mention chaos. It’s something that comes up with a lot of the collectors, that a collection imposes order. Rather than getting engulfed by the chaos, you have a structure to hold on to. Jeremy Deller: I think that’s what being an artist or a musician is: trying to make sense of things around you that you’re not happy about or that confuse you. You make art or music to deal with it, which is a very similar impulse.When we do fashion shows I look through all the T-shirts and we take inspiration from them. The show pieces are just drawing the narrative in a different way. What’s good about Sports Banger is that it joins lots of different worlds and influences. JD: How did you make the move from T-shirts to fashion collections?T-shirts are the fun tokens that pay for everything we do. They come from the bottom, from the rave, and travel upwards. When I got my first studio on Seven Sisters Road, the previous tenants had just been shut down by SO15 counter-terrorist squad. I signed the contract flanked by portraits of Che Guevara and Tito. There was a brothel on the next floor, so it was quite awkward with people pressing the buzzer marked “BANGER”. Next door was Tottenham Textiles, this co-working space for textile workers, and Luis who runs it opened my eyes to how clothes actually get made. Pattern-cutters, grading, overlocker machines. So from there we could use the T-shirts as cue points to inspire collections of clothes. Like, I made a “Team Nigella” T-shirt in response to the 2013 press campaign against Nigella Lawson during her court case, but I also collected every newspaper story throughout her ordeal, scanned and printed them on to fabric, and used that material to make a kimono-style parka for the 2020 collection. JC: In your last collection you had a Lucozade dress and that really chimed with me. Lucozade used to be something you took to ill people in hospital and it wasn’t until I went to raves when I moved to London that I encountered people who drank it because they’d been up all night. Without them, Lucozade would have died as a product.Yes – Lucozade sponsored my last show. The production costs were going up and up so I bootlegged a load of Energy T-shirts because I needed something to sell immediately after the show and I thought that would be a goer. Two weeks before the show we’d spent so much that I got in touch with Lucozade and asked if they wanted to sponsor it. They came on board two days before showtime, which was wicked. Lucozade is a British institution – that bottle! There’s only a few bottles on the market that are iconic. The colour and the shape are so distinctive. JD: Being at that fashion show reminded me of being in clubs. It’s emotional when you see something like that. It was also quite confrontational – especially the dancers wearing the Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock, Priti Patel, Rishi Sunak and Jacob Rees-Mogg Spitting Image masks. What was the collection called?The original title was Honestly, We Can’t Afford It. We were going back and forth, wondering why we were doing this fashion show. Then I said: “Because the people need it!” So the title became The People Deserve Beauty. It did feel like we were taking a load of money and throwing it in the bin just for half an hour of joy. We don’t make the clothes we present at the shows to sell in shops. We just put it on a rail and go: “That looks nice. Maybe we’ll make it one day.” We also gave out Heras roses at the show, which were crowdsourced. Our record label is called Heras because that’s the name of the fencing company who put up all the barriers at festivals. The fencing is used to prevent public access. Our records sound like what the fence looks like – hard, obnoxious, but a design classic built for purpose. I posted on Instagram asking for people to send in Heras logos because you can pop them off the fencing really easily. We got hundreds so we made roses and a showpiece corset. People sending them in didn’t know what we were doing with them, but they just wanted to help. There’s a beauty in that. JD: Has the Heras fencing company ever been in touch about this?No – people who work in their office have hit me up and said if I ever need stationery or USBs, to just ask. They’ve sent it over and I use it as record company merch. I’ve had cease and desist letters from the government identity protection team over my NHS Nike T-shirt though. I originally made that in 2015 to support the junior doctors’ strike. That made me think about my mum’s work for the NHS and the care she received, and I wanted to do something. It brought up feelings about my past that I hadn’t really talked about. The NHS is good, so I added the Nike tick to the logo. NHS = good. The sad thing is no one would have bought the T-shirt if it just said NHS. The NHS is free, but add the Nike swoosh and it’s worth £19.99. I brought it back for the pandemic because of the kids’ meal voucher fiasco. It made me really angry. I’ve been that kid, picking up child benefit money, raised on income support and then disability benefits when my mum was too ill to work; my parents split up when I was four. We sent up daily food deliveries to ICU staff at six local hospitals and also set up a food bank at a primary school using money from the T-shirt sales. Honestly, if you can throw a rave, you can throw a food bank. All through this, I got emails from the government identity protection team, so in the end I had to make the T-shirt disappear. I got one email from Nike which was clearly from an automated image-tracking website so I contacted Nike direct to see if they meant it. I got a phone call from their head office the next day, saying I had an unofficial “licence to swoosh” and asking for my details so they could send a silent donation for the work I was doing. JC: Tell me about the Covid letters…They’re the best things we ever did. It came about because someone got in touch to say their NHS T-shirt arrived in the same post as their Boris letter. They said: “One of these is going in the bin.” I just thought we could do something better with that letter. I posted on Instagram: “If you received one of these and you’re under 16, draw on it and let us know how you feel.” It went from there. It was just an off-the-cuff action but I got so many replies. Every kid who sent a drawing in got a bootleg, pirate Blue Peter badge that I made and a certificate. Parents told us that the act of defacing that letter let them have their first conversations with their children about government, welfare and the NHS. At the private view at the Foundling Museum, there was great energy, people laughing and talking to one another. It felt like the smoking area at a rave. JC: That feeling is what makes things, especially activism, fun. You don’t want to walk around with a serious face, and it confuses people if you’ve having a laugh.We got Caro Howell, director of the Foundling Museum, to write the name of our last fashion show on all the invitations, because she’s got beautiful handwriting. So she came here and wrote “The People Deserve Beauty” loads of times and told us about Hogarth’s The Analysis of Beauty and the line of beauty while she did it. I didn’t know any of those references. JD: Rave in its widest sense infuses everything you do. Is that spirit of rave important to your work?Yes it is. I host at raves. Hosting is different from rapping – I’m saying the same stuff that your mate’s saying in your ear, but I’m on stage with a microphone and a cigarette. I used to be a DJ when I was 16 and got to the semi-finals of the UK Battle for Supremacy. Everything I do comes back to the music and that spirit of rave. I think people feel a duty of care at a rave: if you see someone having a bad time you check if they’re all right. There weren’t raves during the pandemic, but the duty of care didn’t stop. That’s what’s good about Sports Banger, it joins all these different worlds and influences. From ballroom dancers from Paris to drag queens, grime artists, indie kids, bricklayers and party ravers. You’ve got five-year-olds wearing our T-shirts and 85-year-olds. And everyone in between.",Lifestyle/Fashion,‘Everything comes back to the spirit of rave’: Jonny Banger in conversation with Jarvis Cocker and Jeremy Deller,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/08/jonny-sports-banger-in-conversation-with-jarvis-cocker-and-jeremy-deller
5/8/2022,"In the days ahead the fashionable will be swapping their trainers for sandals but this year the exposure of toes will mean not only the need for a pedicure but also an appetite for heights. Why? Because platform sandals are set to be the shoe of the summer. They have appeared on the catwalk at brands like Versace, Rejina Pyo, Valentino and Jacquemus. Kendall Jenner, Dua Lipa and Bella Hadid have endorsed the trend. And it’s starting to show in shopping habits. In April, Klarna revealed that searches for platform sandals were up 69% in the last six months. “Platforms are really doing incredibly well, from Saint Laurent’s Bianca and Jodie, to Valentino Garavani’s Tan-go and D’Accori,” said Cassie Smart, the head of womenswear at Matchesfashion. This is also the case beyond luxury brands: Asos reports that platforms are “becoming a wardrobe staple for our customers”. The Note sandal, a glamorous platform style that comes in various summery prints, is particularly popular. For Laura Antonia Jordan, fashion & lifestyle features director at Grazia, the return of platforms like these spell “the end of Zoom era fashion. I think they are now what those supersized earrings were during lockdowns. They signal that dressing up – properly, head to toe – is back.” Jordan is a longtime fan of the platform: “They are my favoured heel because I am 5ft 1in, I can actually walk in them and I think the clompy, stompy proportions give them a bit of badass swagger that spindly heels just do not have.” Flatforms – the flat sandal with an extended chunky sole – are also popular. Matches reports that the Prada “cage” sandal – a jelly fisherman’s style design with a platform – has sold out, at £590. For 2022, a flatform with an ankle strap at Marks & Spencer is a bestseller. For those who balk at very high platforms or don’t appreciate the flatform, clog mules – like those made by Scholl in the 1970s – could also be a contender. Maddy Evans, the head of womenswear buying at Marks & Spencer, says designs like this are proving a hit: “They will easily take your summer dress from day to night, whether it’s a British staycation or a beach getaway.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,"This summer’s shoe: the clompy, stompy ‘flatform’ sandal",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/08/this-summers-shoe-the-clompy-stompy-flatform-sandal
5/8/2022,"The torsos of two statues of boxers, dating back to the iron age, have been discovered at the Mont’e Prama necropolis in Sardinia. The latest finds, sculpted in limestone by the Nuragic civilisation, add to several other statues of boxers, wrestlers and archers dug up at the site since the 1970s and which have become known as “the giants of Mont’e Prama”. The bare torsos, along with their fragments, have been identified as depicting Cavalupo boxers, due to the shield wrapped around their bodies. They are similar to two other statues found a few metres away at the site in Cabras, on the Italian island’s west coast, in 2014. The discovery comes after fresh excavations in the southern area of the huge necropolis began in early April. “It’s an exceptional discovery,” said the Italian culture minister, Dario Franceschini, adding that it would shed further light on ancient Mediterranean culture. “Two new jewels add to the mysterious charm of this group of statues,” he said. Archaeologists have also unearthed a major burial road, along which tombs dating between 950BC to 730BC have been found. The Mont’e Prama site was first discovered by local farmers in 1974. It is believed that the warrior statues, ranging in height between 2 and 2.5 metres, guarded tombs at the necropolis. Studies done so far of 170 tombs found that the cemetery was reserved almost exclusively for young men. The Nuragic civilisation flourished in Sardinia until the second century AD. Thousands of large tower-shaped stone structures, known as nuraghi, have been found across the island, although their original purpose is unknown. Some of the statues found at Mont’e Parma have been on display at Cabras museum since 2014. The new statues will also eventually be exhibited. Monica Stochino, the culture ministry’s superintendent for southern Sardinia, said: “The two large and heavy blocks of torsos will need time to be freed from the sediment surrounding them and to be prepared for safe recovery.”",News/World news,Iron-age boxer statues’ torsos discovered in Sardinian necropolis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/iron-age-boxer-statues-torsos-discovered-in-sardinian-necropolis
5/8/2022,"Less than three months after Russian troops moved across the border into Ukraine the economic implications of the war are gradually sinking in. There have been other conflicts since 1945 but it is hard to think of one that has had such a dramatic and sudden impact. The only real comparison is with the Yom Kippur war of 1973. Support for Ukraine has been widespread in the west, among governments and the public, but only now are the consequences of sanctions and embargos starting to be felt. This week the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England raised interest rates in the face of annual inflation rates heading towards 10%. The European Central Bank will follow suit in the months to come. The threat of recession is obvious. Central banks say they are powerless to prevent rising global energy prices from pushing up the cost of living but think they can prevent high inflation becoming embedded. The former chancellor of the exchequer Norman Lamont once said higher unemployment was a “price worth paying” to get inflation under control, and that sentiment lives on. Last year, central banks assumed inflationary pressure would be temporary. There would be bottlenecks as demand picked up as countries came out of lockdown and supply struggled to keep up, but any problems would soon go away. Analogies were drawn with the audience leaving a theatre at the end of a play: there is a crush at the exits but it doesn’t take long before everybody is out on the streets. Actually, things were a bit more complex than that, with more pent-up demand resulting from the lack of spending opportunities during the coronavirus pandemic than central banks thought and more impaired supply chains. The imbalance between demand and supply has since been exacerbated by two factors – the war in Ukraine and China’s zero-tolerance approach to Covid 19 – but it was already pushing up inflation in the second half of 2021. These global shocks are affecting countries in different ways. As the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, pointed out this week, the US is facing what looks like a demand shock, with a tight labour market, strong consumer spending and less exposure to energy prices as a result of being a major gas producer. The euro area is suffering a supply shock because it has a weaker labour market than the US and is more exposed to the rise in energy prices. Britain has elements of both: it is suffering a supply shock from the rising cost of energy and food but, like the US, has low unemployment. Everywhere, though, the story is one of higher inflation, slower growth and hard choices for policymakers. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, has faced criticism for wanting to limit the damage to his country’s economy from the war. In truth, he is merely posing an obvious question: how much pain can governments impose on their populations before support begins to wane? That question is only to get more pertinent as the collateral damage mounts. For the moment, the impact of the war is being cushioned by the opening up of economies as the Omicron variant of Covid 19 becomes less of a threat. Unemployment will continue to fall in the US, the UK and the euro area for some months. The going gets tougher thereafter. The end of the cold war in the early 1990s allowed governments in the west to run down defence spending and reallocate the money elsewhere. Fewer tanks and warships meant more could be spent on health and education without taxes having to rise. If, as seems likely, the cold war is back, harder choices will need to be made, and at a time when ageing populations are intensifying pressures for higher spending. There are other long-term implications of the war. The EU is having to develop a new energy strategy on the hoof as it weans itself off Russian oil and gas. Long global supply chains look less attractive than they did pre-Covid, and self-sufficiency is back in vogue. Both factors threaten to lead to higher prices, at least in the short-term. Clearly, getting policy right in these circumstances is not easy and tricky decisions face central banks and finance ministries. Central banks will suffer a loss of credibility if they allow an inflationary spiral to take hold but monetary overkill that drives their economies deeper into recession won’t do much for their reputations either. The real onus, though, is on finance ministers because fiscal policy – tax and spending decisions – is more effective in the current circumstances than monetary policy. In the UK, Rishi Sunak, seems in no hurry to add to the limited support he provided in the spring statement, preferring to wait for the autumn budget to act. Pressure for a summer mini-budget is bound to increase, however, because by August a new energy price cap will be announced to come into force in October. This looks like adding a further £800 a year to the average household’s bill, taking it to about £2,800. Millions more will be driven into fuel poverty. It is not a question of if there is more help but how generous that support is and when it will be rolled out. It is unrealistic for governments to imagine that support for Ukraine will continue at its current elevated levels when dole queues start to lengthen and living standards really begin to be eroded. There is a quid pro quo here: if foreign policy is to remain hawkish towards Russia, then domestic policy has to turn more doveish to help those most affected by the economic consequences of the war.",News/Business,Rishi Sunak can fight recession risks with a cost of living support package | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/08/rishi-sunak-can-fight-recession-risks-with-a-cost-of-living-support-package
5/8/2022,"Britain’s main pension funds own less than 0.2% of Shell and BP shares, undermining claims that a windfall tax on big oil companies would harm the retirement incomes of UK savers. A review of the oil giants’ shares by the Common Wealth thinktank shows the largest holdings are by US investment companies, including BlackRock and Vanguard, and the wealthy Norwegian pension funds. The UK’s multibillion-pound defined contribution occupational pension funds, which hold the savings of tens of millions of workers, rank among the least important investors after decades of spreading their investments in different markets around the world. Last week, oil industry supporters defended the government’s refusal to levy a windfall tax on North Sea oil firms, including BP and Shell, by saying it would force them to cut investment and dividend payments to shareholders. BP chief executive Bernard Looney, announcing record quarterly profits of £5bn last week, said plans for “up to £18bn worth of investment” over the next eight years would go ahead even if there was a windfall tax on the companies profits. He said £2.5bn would be spent buying back shares to boost their value. Shell also reported a record quarterly profit of £7.3bn for the first three months of the year, piling further pressure on the government to use a windfall tax to fund special measures to tackle soaring household energy bills. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, who has resisted attempts by No 10 to pay for extra support with higher government borrowing, has hinted that he is considering a tax on oil companies, although business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is understood to be against the idea. Nick Butler, a visiting professor at King’s College London who spent almost 30 years as an executive at BP, was among many to argue that a windfall tax would force the oil companies to redirect profits away from shareholders, who he said were ordinary people depending on dividend income to support their pensions. “I think that shareholders who are just pensioners, they are not men in black hats – they are people like you if you have a BP shareholding in your pension. [Paying a dividend] isn’t taking money out of the system,” Butler told the BBC last week. The largest 10 direct shareholdings in both companies are dominated by the subsidiaries of US asset management giants BlackRock and Vanguard, while Asian and Norwegian sovereign wealth funds also own substantial chunks. BlackRock subsidiaries account for four of the largest 10 BP shareholders, and three of the top 10 Shell shareholders. Common Wealth said that while many defined contribution occupational schemes invested in global shares, using large US fund managers, “their vulnerability to a windfall tax on BP and Shell will be absorbed by the huge breadth and diversification of these asset management giants”. Independent pensions consultant John Ralfe said most large final-salary retirement schemes were unlikely to hold BP or Shell shares after selling their holdings to buy safer bonds. Research earlier this year by the TUC, Common Wealth and the High Pay Centre showed that UK pension funds accounted for only 2.4% of the total market value of UK-listed shares, down from 13% before the financial crisis in 2008. Indirect ownership via investment funds accounted for another 6%. “The idea that BP or Shell are widows’ and orphans’ stocks, or that pensioners rely on income from the oil giants to make ends meet, is just risible,” said Ralfe. “As an argument against a windfall tax, it has no validity whatsoever.” Mathew Lawrence, director of Common Wealth, said: “Ministers had two lines of defence – that a windfall tax would cut levels of investment, which even BP has denied, and that the impact on shareholders would substantially hit people’s pensions. “But, though many UK pensioners do hold shares in BP and Shell, the reality is that UK-based pension funds now only own a very small percentage of the total. Ongoing trends, including pension fund diversification and the rise of international asset managers, have transformed ownership of the energy giants. “This has in turn changed who receives the dividends. Given this, any impact from a windfall tax on ordinary pensioners would be more than outweighed by the benefits retired people would receive from additional financial support, funded by redistributing some of BP and Shell’s bumper profits.”",News/Business,"Windfall tax on oil giants won’t hurt British pensioners, thinktank finds",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/08/windfall-tax-on-oil-giants-wont-hurt-british-pensioners-thinktank-finds
5/8/2022,"A University College London scientist has accused lawyers in the US of misusing his groundbreaking work on the brain to justify the dismantling of Roe v Wade, the landmark ruling that legalised abortion nationally in America. Giandomenico Iannetti said his research, which used imaging to understand the adult brain’s response to pain, had been wrongly interpreted to make an anti-abortion argument. Last week an unprecedented leak of a draft legal opinion showed a majority of supreme court judges support overturning Roe v Wade and ending federal protections for abortions, in a move that could result in 26 states banning it. The court is considering a case, Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organisation, which challenges Mississippi’s ban on abortion after 15 weeks gestation. Anti-abortion lawyers in that case argued that scientific understanding has moved on since the court’s 1973 ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion, and it was no longer accurate to say foetuses cannot feel pain before 24 weeks. Their argument relied heavily on a controversial discussion paper on foetal pain published in the Journal of Medical Ethics in 2020 by Dr Stuart Derbyshire, a British associate professor of psychology at the National University of Singapore. The paper claims that some of Iannetti’s research results suggest we might not need a cerebral cortex – which remains undeveloped in a foetus of less than 24 weeks – to feel pain. Iannetti, an Italian professor of neuroscience who now leads a laboratory in Italy but spent the past 16 years researching at UCL and Oxford University, is adamant that this is “an unjustified leap”. “My results by no means imply that the cortex isn’t necessary to feel pain. I feel they were misinterpreted and used in a very clever way to prove a point. It distresses me that my work was misinterpreted and became one of the pillar arguments they [the lawyers] made,” he said. Prof Iannetti had no idea the paper was being used to justify the dismantling of Roe v Wade until American colleagues contacted him to say they were “shocked” at the way his findings were being presented. He helped academics in the US to draft a response for the lawyers but says he feels it is out of his control and “there isn’t much more I can do to stop people claiming my work says something it doesn’t”. Leading pain scientists and academic medical societies on both sides of the Atlantic strongly dispute the anti-abortion legal argument, insisting the international scientific consensus that it is not possible for foetuses to experience pain in the first few weeks of existence remains firm and “irrefutable”. John Wood, professor of molecular neurobiology at UCL, said: “I thought this opinion piece [by Derbyshire] was inaccurate.” Wood insisted that “all serious scientists” agreed a foetus cannot feel pain until 24 weeks, “and perhaps not even then”. He said lawyers were right to say that science has moved on since 1973, but not in the way they were claiming. “For instance, we understand a great deal more about pain in newborn babies,” he said. “Interestingly surgeons who operate on foetuses say that there is movement on surgical intervention from week 36.” Derbyshire told the Observer he is “firmly pro choice”. He insisted that he had not overstepped in his paper, and claimed that while Iannetti’s work had nothing “directly” to do with foetal pain it had “unsettled the consensus that the cortex is necessary for pain”. He said: “I don’t honestly see how we can rule out the foetus having some raw experience that is akin to pain. It may be for ever unknowable, and it will not be an equivalent to what you or I experience, but that does not make it nothing.” Prof Vania Apkarian, director of the Centre for Translational Pain Research at the Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, who has spent two decades studying pain in humans and animals, said the evidence on foetal pain had not changed since 1973 and remains “irrefutable”. “There is no rational basis for arguing a foetus can suffer pain before 24 weeks. The anatomy of the brain is not formed enough for that to be possible,” he said. “The foetus is in an essentially sleep-like state in the womb.” Apkarian wrote the scientific briefing for the Jackson Women’s Health Organisation case, on behalf of organisations including the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in the US and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK. He spent months checking all the anti-abortion scientific references in case his side had missed some piece of serious evidence. “We hadn’t,” he said. Apkarian believes science has been roped into a social and religious battle over abortion in order to play on people’s emotions. “The Mississippi case claimed that the foetus, when aborted, is suffering. They claimed that because it is such an emotionally highly laden statement. But it is also totally untrue,” he said. Dr Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, in New York, said: “The bottom line is that a patient’s health, not unproven theories, should drive important medical decisions.”",News/US news,British scientist says US anti-abortion lawyers misused his work to attack Roe v Wade,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/08/british-scientist-says-us-anti-abortion-lawyers-misused-his-work-to-attack-roe-v-wade
5/8/2022,"Alex tells Charlotte he is angry that “your people” are being incarcerated. He seems not to notice her quietly spoken response: “Why not just say people?” The two have just met in the Manhattan loft apartment of Black Lives Matter activist and student Alex’s art-collector parents. Charles and Virginia specialise in African American art, and art with a “racial theme”. As Virginia puts it, gesturing to examples on display around the sparkling dinner table and white sofas, the couple’s “commitment is on the walls” (in Debbie Duru’s set, the images are not shown but are suggested to the audience’s imagination by super-size, gallery-style descriptor panels). Charlotte is being introduced to the couple by their friend and art dealer, Eric, who hopes that they will invest in her work. When Charles, impressed by Charlotte’s “measured” demeanour, considers inviting her to join the board of his foundation, Eric responds: “That would solve the diversity issue.” Claudia Rankine’s 2019 play of ideas, set during Trump’s presidency, presents a multifaceted exploration of the invisibility of whiteness, the root of racism in the US. (Rankine is an American poet and essayist as well as a playwright.) In Natalie Ibu’s sharp production, its relevance to the UK is highlighted during the entr’acte: scene-changers hold up mirrors, reflecting the audience back to itself. Charles unexpectedly visits Charlotte in her studio a year later. Since the confrontations of the dinner party, the artist has shifted the focus of her work from “black suffering”, which unintentionally allowed the viewer “not to look at whiteness”. Now, she concentrates on making visible the construct of whiteness and white people’s “ordinary complicity” in racial violence. This table-turning horrifies Charles: “I am not that history!” The play’s challenges to ways of seeing are powerfully presented by a strong ensemble cast, with special mention to Estella Daniels’s Charlotte and Matthew Pidgeon’s Charles.
