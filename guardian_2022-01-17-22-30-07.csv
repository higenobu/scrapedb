1/17/2022,"Marlon Bundo, the family pet rabbit of former vice-president Mike Pence, has died, marking the end of an unlikely career as a prominent gay rights figure in the US. Charlotte Pence Bond, Pence’s daughter, announced Bundo’s death in posts on social media. “Somehow, you taught me how to always try to be kind first and never stop making an effort to get along. We had some wild times together and I’m forever grateful. Rest in sweet peace, little bunny,” she wrote.  Political pets are a common theme in American politics – from the president on down – but Bundo’s high media profile was unusual. Firstly, he figured as the central character in a series of children’s books written by the second family. Secondly, as a parody of Pence’s deep social conservatism and history of opposing gay marriage, Bundo was also the main theme of a satirical book launched by late-night TV comedian John Oliver, that chronicled his search for a same-sex bunny partner. That book was called A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo and Oliver described the Pence rabbit as a “very special boy bunny who falls in love with another boy bunny”. Proceeds were donated to the Trevor Project, which works on suicide prevention organization for young LGBTQ+ people, and the Aids United charity. It was in marked contrast to the Pence family books which were called things like A Day in the Nation’s Capital and Best Christmas Ever. Oliver’s book, written by Jill Twiss, a comedian and staff writer on Oliver’s show, became a runaway bestseller in the US and hit the top spot on Amazon, outpacing the Pence books and delighting LGBTQ+ rights groups. Pence is staunchly opposed to gay marriage, and once said in 2006 it would lead to the “deterioration of the family” and “societal collapse”. But in Oliver’s world Bundo wants to marry a handsome fellow boy rabbit called Wesley in a tale “of tolerance and advocacy ... [exploring] issues of same-sex marriage and democracy”.",News/US news," Marlon Bundo, Pence family pet rabbit and unlikely star of gay rights book, dies",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/17/mike-pence-rabbit-marlon-bundo-dies
1/17/2022,"An architect has applied at the high court to change his name by deed poll to “Kill the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill” in protest at punitive new anti-protest legislation being debated in the House of Lords on Monday. Nick Newman, 35, from London, went to the Royal Courts of Justice on Monday morning to make the application. It comes as peers have an unusual opportunity to vote down some of the most controversial of the government’s proposals.  “My hope is to share a humorous action with a serious message to convince a couple of lords to vote the right way,” he said. The police and crime bill has been criticised by protest groups, human rights organisations and even parliament’s joint committee on human rights, with many highlighting how, among other measures, it would criminalise causing “serious annoyance”, with potential 10-year sentences for offenders. “I wanted [the name change] to be something which was clearly not something that would be useful in everyday life and in fact could be described as ‘really annoying’ to use,” Newman told the Guardian. “To my friends and family who think that the name is going to be a bit too annoying, my answer to them is: ‘Just call me Bill.’” Newman is an environmental activist who has been arrested several times for protests in the past few years. Among them have been lock-on actions, where protesters attach themselves to a structure to make it more difficult to remove, which will be specifically criminalised under amendments being debated in the Lords on Monday. “This new policing bill is really going so far that people in my position who wish to exercise their rights to protest are going to be seriously curtailed,” he said. “Some of the things which have been proposed specifically in these amendments which are being debated in the House of Lords today are going to impose prison sentences for simple things like attaching yourself to a structure. “So if I had redone some of the protests that I had already done under the new bill then I would go to jail for up to a year.” The action was intended to tie in with a “really annoying demo” planned by the comedian Mark Thomas at Westminster later on Monday. Once Newman has received his new name, he will be attending the protest from 5pm at College Green, opposite the House of Lords.",News/Law,"Man seeks to change name to ‘Kill the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill’",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/17/man-seeks-to-change-name-to-kill-the-police-sentencing-and-courts-bill
1/17/2022,"The Guardian and Observer climate justice appeal is to remain open for another few days after raising just short of £1m for charities supporting communities severely affected by climate-induced extreme weather events. After a late surge in donations over the weekend, the total had reached £940,000 by midnight on Sunday when the appeal was originally scheduled to close. The appeal will now remain open in the hope it can hit the £1m mark.  More than 8,800 generous readers have so far donated to the appeal. Donations will be shared between four charities: Practical Action, Global Greengrants Fund UK, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, and Environmental Justice Foundation. The theme this year is climate justice, inspired by stories of people and communities uprooted by climate volatility, whether flooding, wildfire, melting ice or drought, from Madagascar to the Arctic Circle. The appeal has struck a chord with many readers, who in hundreds of messages left via the appeal donation website emphasised the urgency of tackling the climate crisis. “It is a privilege to do a small thing to support grassroots projects doing direct work in communities hit hardest by climate change,” one donor wrote. Sarah Roberts, the chief executive of Practical Action, said: “I’d like to say a huge thank you to Guardian and Observer readers for their support. The money will help the world’s most vulnerable people living at the sharp end of the climate crisis gain vital new skills to adapt their lives to their new environmental reality.” Eva Rehse, the executive director of Global Greengrants Fund UK, said: “Thank you to everyone who has given so generously. We are so grateful for your donations, which enable Global Greengrants and our partners in the Clima Fund to support grassroots movements for climate justice led by those already most impacted by the climate crisis – women and girls, youth, Indigenous peoples and rural communities.” Introducing the appeal in December, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, wrote: “The stark truth is that the world’s developing countries have seen the vast majority of the death and destruction caused by climate-induced disasters, and yet they are responsible for a tiny fraction of global emissions.” Donations can be made online by credit card, debit card or PayPal, or by phone on 0151 284 1126.

1/17/2022,"Brentford have offered Christian Eriksen the chance of a return to the Premier League as the playmaker assesses his options for a competitive comeback. Eriksen, 29, has not played since suffering a cardiac arrest during Denmark’s Euro 2020 game with Finland on 12 June, and became a free agent when Internazionale terminated his contract last month. He is keen for a return to top-level action ahead of the World Cup and Brentford have moved to offer him a six-month deal, which would have the potential to be extended. Should Eriksen accept, he would return to the English top flight two years after leaving Tottenham for the Serie A club.  Eriksen is not short of suitors and, despite Brentford’s interest, no decision has yet been made over his future. However, a move to the west London side could be appealing given the heavy Danish presence in their squad. Eight of their players are from Denmark and so is the head coach, Thomas Frank, who has steered them to 14th place in their first Premier League season and worked with Eriksen in the national youth team set-up. Eriksen received lifesaving treatment on the pitch in Copenhagen after his cardiac arrest and was fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator device (ICD). His departure from Inter owed to the fact Serie A rules do not allow players with an ICD to compete but Eriksen has been training at Odense, his old club in Denmark, and said this month that he feels ready to come back. “My goal is to play in the World Cup in Qatar,” he said. “I want to play. That’s been my mindset all along. It’s a goal, a dream. Whether I’ll be picked is another thing. But it’s my dream to come back. I’m sure I can because I don’t feel any different. Physically, I’m back in top shape.”",Sport/Football,Brentford offer Christian Eriksen Premier League return ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/17/brentford-offer-christian-eriksen-premier-league-return
1/17/2022,"It has been 12 years since Ivan Juric told an interviewer from Rolling Stone magazine that footballers “don’t know shit about music”. The Croatian was enjoying the final days of his playing career at Genoa, soaking up knowledge from a manager, Gian Piero Gasperini, who would become his greatest influence as he prepared to make his own move into coaching. Still, Juric harboured one regret. “The only other metal-head I have played with in a 15-year career was an Argentinian goalkeeper at Crotone,” he said. “I started at 14 years old with Metallica and Megadeth, then I moved on to more aggressive things. Death metal is my passion, bands like Napalm Death, Obituary and Carcass.”  Little did we know that he was preparing to bring the energy of those bands to Serie A training grounds. Where Jürgen Klopp unleashed “heavy metal football” on the Premier League, Juric’s approach was defined by one writer from the Sky Sports-owned analytics site ultimouomo.com this week as being outright “satanic”. To be clear, nobody is accusing the now Torino manager of actual devil worship. The author defined satanism as “the practice of a negative theology, of turning good into bad”, the undoing of a “canonical idea of football as the creative expression of a human being through a football.” It was an elegant way of saying that Juric’s football is percussive, violent, destructive. And most of all fiendishly effective. Torino are soaring under Juric, hired to replace Davide Nicola in the summer. A side that finished 16th and 17th in Serie A over the last two seasons ended this weekend in ninth – 15 points better off than they were at the corresponding point in 2021. In the space of five days last week, they thrashed Fiorentina 4-0 and then beat Sampdoria 2-1 at Marassi. These were two very different games, each with much to tell us about the team’s recent growth. Fiorentina – a side with stated European ambitions who had even been discussed as a dark horse for the top four – were simply overrun, unable to escape Torino’s relentless high press. The broad strokes of Juric’s gameplan were nothing new. Like his mentor, Gasperini, he frequently pairs players up one-on-one with opponents all over the pitch and trusts them to engage in individual duels. Where the approach sometimes differs is in the sheer levels of aggression. Juric encourages his forwards to attack the ball-carrier at almost every opportunity. That approach can make for messy matches. Torino commit more fouls than any other team in Serie A, and it’s not close: averaging 17.6 per game compared with just 14.5 for the second-most prolific offenders, Verona – the team who Juric coached for the preceding two seasons. Yet Torino sit middle of the pack when it comes to yellow cards, with 11 other teams collecting more. Their fouling is not reckless but often tactical, premised on the idea that it is better to give away an innocuous free-kick deep in opposition territory than to let a move get started. Such infringements are also far less likely to draw bookings. And the longer that a team stay trapped in their own half, the more likely that they become impatient and flustered. As the above piece from ultimouomo.com also observed, Torino give up fewer passes per loss of possession to opponents than any other team in the league. Not every adversary, however, can simply be shut out of a game. Saturday’s win was complicated by a goal conceded against the run of play. Francesco Caputo opened the scoring for Sampdoria in the 18th minute, punishing a careless clearance from Torino’s goalkeeper, Vanja Milinkovic-Savic. Now Juric’s team had two sets of mental hurdles to overcome. They had not taken points from a losing position all season, and nor had they won away from home since September. Torino’s death metal dance has made them brilliant at not conceding goals, but they still often struggle to score them. Andrea Belotti, after hitting double figures in each of the past six seasons, has been sidelined for most of the campaign with injuries. His teammates turned things around on Saturday with two headers, Wilfried Songo converting a cross from Mërgim Vojvoda and then Dennis Praet doing likewise from a Sasa Lukic delivery. The ball went straight through a hole in the net on the second occasion, leading to a few brief seconds of confusion and then several minutes of amusement as an ever-growing cast of high-vis jackets arrived to consult before one finally accepted the task of stitching it back together. The pause provided us with another moment to reflect on Juric’s successes. Vojvoda had begun the season as a back-up to Songo at right wing-back, collecting just a few minutes here and there before being swapped to the left in November. The Kosovo international was unfamiliar with playing on that flank but has grown into the role brilliantly. This was his second assist in as many games. There are coaching success stories to be found all through Torino’s first team. Sasa Lukic’s improvement in central midfield has been remarkable to watch after two underwhelming seasons. Loan signings Praet and Brekalo have impressed behind the attack. Sampdoria 1-2 Torino, Salernitana 0-3 Lazio, Juventus 2-0 Udinese, Sassuolo 2-4 Verona, Venezia 1-1 Empoli, Roma 1-0 Cagliari, Atalanta 1-1 Inter Milan The question now is how far Torino can go. Their president, Urbano Cairo, was keen to play down talk of a European push on Saturday, saying they could leave such considerations for the end. “Every season Atalanta say that their first objective is to get to 40 points,” he observed. “If they say it, a team who have been in Europe for a few years, then we can say the same.” Juric was a little less shy, saying that his team needed to stay focused on the present but that “up until now I think we’ve earned it”. Regardless, he will carry on the work he has been doing. Week by week, his team look more confident in the tune they are playing.",Sport/Football, Juric’s death metal approach has made Torino a devilish team to face | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/17/ivan-juric-death-metal-approach-torino-devilish-team-serie-a
1/17/2022,"China has warned the US and Europe against a rapid rise in interest rates that would “slam on the brakes” of the global recovery from the pandemic. Central banks should maintain the monetary stimulus or risk “serious economic consequences” from the spillover effects with developing markets bearing the brunt.  In a virtual speech to open the World Economic Forum’s Davos Agenda, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, said that while global inflation risks were emerging, policymakers should strengthen economic policy coordination and develop policies to prevent the world economy from dipping again. “We must do everything necessary to clear the shadow of the pandemic and boost economic and social recovery and development,” he said. “If major economies slam on the brakes or make major U-turns in their monetary policies there will be serious negative spillovers. They would present challenges to global and economic financial stability and developing countries would bear the brunt.” China is among many countries across Asia, Africa and South America concerned about plans flagged by the US central bank to accelerate a series of planned interest rate rises this year and begin rolling back its quantitative easing stimulus programme. The Federal Reserve has came under intense pressure to respond to rising inflation, which soared to 7% in December, its highest level in 40 years. Policymakers at the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are also expected to tighten monetary policy in the coming months, heightening the risk of indebted countries failing to meet loan repayments. Tensions with the US extend beyond monetary policy to concerns over intellectual property, trade, the fate of Taiwan, human rights and the South China Sea. Xi said: “We need to discard cold war mentality and seek peaceful coexistence and win-win outcomes. Our world today is far from being tranquil,” said Xi, through a translator. “Protectionism and unilateralism can protect no one. They ultimately hurt the interests of others as well as one’s own. Even worse are the practices of hegemony and bullying, which run counter to the tide of history. “A zero-sum approach that enlarges one’s own gain at the expense of others will not help,” he added. “The right way forward for humanity is peaceful development and win-win cooperation.” Xi was speaking after the latest figures showed China’s economy slowed at the end of last year to 4% in the three months from October to December compared with the same period in 2020. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed the weakest expansion in 18 months as the Covid-19 pandemic and the crisis in its property sector hit growth. In the first three quarters of 2021 China’s economy expanded by more than 9%, but since the summer it has slowed dramatically, prompting Beijing to cut a key interest rate. Analysts have blamed Beijing’s zero tolerance approach to the Covid-19 virus, which has included restricting all movement in cities that have only a handful of cases. Retail sales growth slowed sharply to just 1.7% year-on-year in December, down from 3.9%, the bureau said. Spillovers from the crisis at indebted property developer Evergrande also weighed on China’s economy. Louis Kuijs, the head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said Xi’s administration was unlikely to tolerate GDP growth of less than 5%, which meant a further cut in borrowing costs was possible. “If growth is weaker than that, Beijing will feel strongly motivated to pursue more policy easing,” she said.",News/Business,China warns west against rapid interest rate rise,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/17/china-warns-west-against-rapid-interest-rate-rise
1/17/2022,"When all else fails, send in the big guns. Or rather, pretend to. In the 1997 American satire Wag the Dog, a devious president invents a fictional war with Albania to distract voters from an embarrassing sex scandal. And by shamelessly whipping up a patriotic storm, he almost gets away with it. While Boris Johnson has thankfully stopped short of declaring a war, he appears to be offering wobbling Conservative voters the next best thing: Operation Red Meat, involving threats to deploy the RAF and the navy against migrant boats in the Channel, plus some ritual BBC-bashing and assorted other wheezes designed to buy a beleaguered prime minister time. Presumably, he wants Daily Express readers to be under the vague impression that Britain is ready, if not quite to bomb refugees back to France, then at the very least to up the ante. Like the rest of Operation Red Meat, however, this one whiffs of something long past its sell-by date.  The plan, insofar as it can be called that, is to deploy military assets to track small boats crossing the Channel and escort them ashore for processing, but then shift the actual processing somewhere less appealing than England. (Last time this plan surfaced, it was to be Albania, until the Albanians announced this was the first they’d heard of it; now Rwanda and Ghana are floated.) The idea of militarising Britain’s response to terrified refugees will of course be offensive and distressing to many. But the twist in the tale for its intended audience of core Conservative voters is that if it works as planned, it could, if anything, make the crossing safer. People are less likely to drown under military escort than slipping ashore unnoticed in the dark. And while the threat of being ushered straight to an asylum processing centre may deter migrants keen to disappear into the black market, it’s less obvious why the two-thirds of boat passengers estimated to end up successfully claiming asylum would fear being whisked into a system they want to enter anyway. The culture secretary Nadine Dorries’ full-frontal attack on the BBC, declaring “it’s over” for them before the review of its future funding has even begun, looks no better thought through. Like it or not, perhaps there’s an electorally seductive case to be made that viewers who have decamped to Netflix shouldn’t be made to pay for channels they don’t watch. But couching it as a nakedly political attack on the BBC just raises hackles, making any ensuing legislation less likely to get past the House of Lords. Or to put it another way, what a Johnson government promises may not be what a Johnson government actually delivers, something we should arguably all be used to by now. As recovery plans go, this one is a classic of its hastily conceived kind; chuck a few unfortunate people off the back of the sledge and give the newspapers something else to talk about. Johnson’s principal private secretary Martin Reynolds is duly emerging as the likely fall guy for the May 2020 garden party that the prime minister claims not to have realised was a party; and since Reynolds sent the invite asking staff to bring a bottle, his position does look increasingly untenable. But it remains difficult to believe that an experienced Whitehall official, who had worked with Johnson at the Foreign Office before No 10, somehow went rogue behind his back. Are we really to believe Johnson, that well-known innocent in such matters, was led astray by party animal Sir Humphrey? And to think that Tories used to complain civil servants were stick-in-the-muds. The new policy agenda, meanwhile, not only falls apart when prodded but lacks a compelling reason for Johnson himself to lead it. There are things, even now, that only Johnson can do; parts of the country only he can reach, emotional registers only he can strike, gambles so wild only he can get away with them. But does any Conservative voter keen to see this stuff enacted really imagine that Liz Truss couldn’t send in the gunboats, or that Rishi Sunak wouldn’t be eyeing up the BBC’s funding? Unlike Brexit, these aren’t concepts requiring the Johnson magic touch to bring them alive, and they don’t even convincingly feel like his idea. If Operation Red Meat is a strategy for surviving the next few days only, rather than the next few years, then right now it may be the best that an office full of people worrying they might be sacked can manage. If they can just hang on long enough – and Theresa May hung on longer than seemed possible, as her chief tormentor Johnson doubtless recalls – then the shine may well come off potential successors in the meantime. Truss may overplay her hand, or Sunak be tarnished by the cost-of-living crisis. So long as Tory voters tell pollsters they’re switching to “don’t know” rather than directly to Labour, there’s always a chance of winning them back. But not with a plan that sounds as if it could have been scribbled on the back of a fag packet after a particularly heavy “wine time” session, and not with a leader who still doesn’t seem to understand why people are so angry. It’s not the lack of red meat on the menu. It’s not the way the kitchen operates. It’s that they no longer believe the chef.

1/17/2022,"Ayoung, majority-black theatre company’s rewriting of Shakespeare will “change the face of classical theatre” by bringing the bard’s work back to the “slang” in which it was born, Sir Mark Rylance has said. Rylance, an esteemed Shakespearean actor and the first artistic director of the Globe, is a trustee of Intermission Youth Theatre, a charity that aims to transform the lives of disadvantaged young people by getting them to perform Shakespeare’s work.  Intermission’s most recent production, Juliet & Romeo at the Chelsea Theatre, was a radical retelling of Shakespeare’s classic tale of doomed romance, using modern references and dialect to explore London’s postcode violence. The roles of the main characters were also swapped, making Juliet a Montague and a dominant force who pursued her shy and meek love interest with an unexpected passion and vigour. “There was a question of identity for Shakespeare that’s very much a part of this culture,” Rylance said. “We forget that the English language in Shakespeare’s day was a minority language in Europe. French, Italian, Greek, Latin all seemed much more powerful. So Shakespeare created new words, compounds, and he also stole words. “When I’m around these young people, there’s a lot of words they’re using I don’t understand, and that’s on purpose. My dominant culture isn’t letting them in. It’s in that spirit that Shakespeare was born, a creative use of language to create identity.” Intermission’s reimagined plays make the political and personal struggles of centuries gone accessible, not just for a modern theatre audience, but also for those who have previously felt disfranchised by the art form and industry that surrounds it. Trained by the company’s artistic director, Darren Raymond, teens have gone on to study at leading drama schools and performed with major companies including the Globe, the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company. “This is work that is going to change the face of classical theatre … it’s going to change the actual kind of productions and the way we speak,” Rylance added. Raymond, who originally set up the company at a theatre church in 2008, said the writing was a collaborative process between him and the young actors, who bring their own experiences to the text. “It always surprises me, the discoveries we make when we look at a piece with young people,” he said. “Those young people have grown up in some of the toughest boroughs of London, where there’s a lot of gang warfare. One of them recently spoke about losing a friend to knife crime, and the massive impact it had on their life … I’m very passionate about making sure that our young people believe they can have ownership over Shakespeare. Because it can open a lot of doors inside of us.” For Rylance, who played Thomas Cromwell in a TV adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall, it’s important to work with young people when they’re first encountering Shakespeare to ensure they’re not put off. “I want there to be more diversity on our stages … that means going back to the root,” he said. “It means making sure that at the first contact with this stuff, no young person feels that they’re inferior to it. Shakespeare isn’t for everyone, but some people have a gift for it. The next Lionel Messi or Ronaldo might emerge from anywhere in society.” A lot of the young actors at Intermission, he added, “haven’t been given intellectual thoughts and fears” about Shakespeare by meeting his work in the classroom. “So it becomes something to kick about. They’re able to commit themselves emotionally and vulnerably, which is very moving.” Diversity on stage isn’t the only notable thing at Intermission’s productions. On a Thursday night in December, most of the audience was from a black or ethnic minority background. There were cheers, dancing to a soundtrack including UK garage classics, and an immersive Q&A with the cast after the show. “Some of the audience have never stepped into a theatre before,” Raymond said. “And they’re sitting next to avid theatregoers, lords and ladies. I look at our audience and think: this is how it should be.” This bending of Shakespeare’s classic characters is becoming more familiar to theatre-goers.

1/17/2022,"The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, has ordered an inquiry into a champagne celebration involving officials in his department at the height of the first Covid lockdown. A photo of the celebration in June 2020 showed about 20 officials drinking Moët & Chandon champagne, without wearing masks or social distancing.  A spokesperson said Coveney had asked the department’s secretary general, Joe Hackett, to send him a report on the “impromptu gathering” by the end of the month. The party on 17 June 2020 came as Ireland was three months into one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. Not only were indoor gatherings restricted to six people but people were not allowed move beyond their counties. A selfie tweeted by the then secretary general, Niall Burgess, now the ambassador to France, was posted on Twitter on the night but subsequently taken down. In his first public comments on the controversy Coveney told RTÉ that he had been made aware of the gathering after the photograph had appeared on social media. He said he had decided not to investigate at the time because officials admitted wrongdoing and he did not think it required further action. “My secretary general at the time acknowledged that it shouldn’t have happened and it was a momentary drop of our guard, I think was what he said,” Coveney said. “This was something that had happened. It was quite public because it was put up on social media. It was taken down, there was an acknowledgement of wrongdoing if you like. “I trusted my secretary general and I felt that clearly, what happened shouldn’t have happened. I didn’t feel that there was a need for follow-up after that.” The current focus on the gathering appears to have been fuelled by partygate in the UK, with renewed interest in the standards adhered to by public figures during lockdown. In the RTÉ interview on Friday Coveney was repeatedly asked about the gathering in light of the controversy in London.“People like me and my department need to lead by example. This is something that I think many in the department are very embarrassed about and feel ashamed about, but it happened and it didn’t happen since. I think from that point of view, the lesson has been learned,” he said.",News/World news,Irish foreign minister orders inquiry into champagne party during lockdown,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/irish-foreign-minister-orders-inquiry-into-champagne-party-during-lockdown

1/17/2022,"He should have been a hero for a second straight week, but that’s just not how things are working out for Borussia Mönchengladbach right now. Yann Sommer had already flexed his considerable goalkeeping muscles last week, keeping Bayern Munich at bay to help bring home a famous win. This week, the Switzerland star perhaps even bettered himself.  In Saturday’s late game with Bayer Leverkusen, a perennial rival for the Champions League places in recent years, Sommer saved not one but two penalties in the second half, and they were both great stops, first plunging to his right to deny Patrik Schick and then later to his left to fingertip Kerem Demirbay’s effort. He became the first goalkeeper to deny two penalties in a Bundesliga game since FC Nürnberg’s Raphael Schäfer kept out efforts from Domi Kumbela and Ermin Bicakcic in February 2014. The difference there was that Schäfer’s heroics helped Nürnberg win the game. For Sommer despite that and another of other stops, notably an excellent double save from Amine Adli to keep hope flickering for Gladbach as time ran out, there was no such reward. Even the greatest of goalkeepers can only do so much and for Sommer, the miracle was holding back the tide for so long. He faced 32 shots from Leverkusen ( they created from just 45% of the possession), 14 of which were on target, for an eye-watering xG of 6.22. Still, he kept the visitors hanging on. “We were more tense than usual on the bench in those last few minutes,” confessed Leverkusen coach Gerardo Seoane. “A set piece or a deflected shot can always happen to you.” Jonathan Tah, the defender, said, “another 2-2 would have been a disaster,” underlining how the shadow of Sommer was starting to loom in the minds of Leverkusen. The goalkeeper may not have earned his side a point, but he has perhaps earned Adi Hütter some cover. This fixture has usually felt like it had direct consequences of late, but not this time. The win put Die Werkself into third position but Gladbach will not be troubling them in a hurry, now trailing them by ten points. They are only four points ahead of the relegation play-off place and second-bottom Stuttgart and but for Sommer, could have suffered a truly humbling defeat. In a different context and with a different headline, Hütter’s defensive choices might be coming under greater scrutiny. Marvin Friedrich, who arrived from Union Berlin this week, was less thrown in the deep end, more chucked in the middle of the ocean without a life vest. The coach described the choice to include him rather than Matthias Ginter, who will not extend his expiring contract, as backing “a player for the future.” He does realise that in their current state of difficulty, he can’t rule any options out, though. “Ginter is a good player and I didn’t say the door was closed,” said Hütter. “We have to get out of this situation with or without him.” 300 #Bundesliga goals for @Lewy_official ⚽️⭐️Can @FCBayernEN's star No.9 catch the league's all-time leading scorer, Gerd Müller? 🐐 pic.twitter.com/ivq6TuCLZh And what a situation it is, with Gladbach the owners of the third-worst defensive record in the division - behind long-gone Greuther Fürth and ailing Hertha - and the defence far from the only problem. The midfield is failing to protect the backline which is why Hütter underlined “you can’t compare” the status of Denis Zakaria, another on an expiring deal who might even go this month, with that of Ginter. Put simply, it is an area in which the team has far greater need. Laszlo Benes, starting a second Bundesliga game of the season in place of the unwell Christoph Kramer, looked lost even before conceding the first penalty. Robert Andrich headed Leverkusen in front from the resulting corner). At the other end, some product from Alessane Péa and Marcus Thuram (combined goals tally this season - three) would be also welcome to give Sommer some respite. Back in 2014 it may have worked out for Scäfer on the day but the season went downhill rapidly. Nürnberg lost 11 of their remaining 12 games and were relegated. Gladbach will hope the opposite fates after their goalkeepers’ big days will continue. Dortmund 5-1 Freiburg Wolfsburg 0-0 Hertha Berlin, Union Berlin 2 -1 Hoffenheim, Stuttgart 0-2 RB Leipzig, Mainz 1-0 Bochum, Köln 0-4 Bayern, Monchengladbach 1-2 Leverkusen, Augsburg 1-1 Eintracht, Arminia Bielefeld 2-2 Greuther Furth One of Borussia Dortmund’s most complete performances of an unpredictable season, Friday’s 5-1 win over Freiburg, was quickly overshadowed by a post-match interview Erling Haaland - who scored twice - gave with Norwegian broadcaster Viaplay in which he told reporter Jan Aage Fjørtoft that “the club is trying to put pressure on me to make a decision” on whether he will stay beyond the summer. This was refuted by Sebastian Kehl on Sport 1’s Doppelpass (“we’re not pushing him at all, but it’s also clear that as a club we have to plan with surety”) but it is hard to see how this saga is resolved cleanly. The plus for BVB is that even if the title seems out of reach, they’ve never looked as comfortable in second place. The gap to Leverkusen in third (eight points) is bigger than the gulf between them and Bayern (six). Bayern’s lead at the top had thus been trimmed to three points overnight but the still-depleted leaders quickly scrubbed away any doubts in an imperious display at Köln on Saturday afternoon, despite still having a number of Covid-related absences. Robert Lewandowski’s hat-trick in a 4-0 win - punctuated by a magnificent strike by the soon-to-be-out-of-contract Corentin Tolisso - took him onto the mark of 300 Bundesliga goals, while Manuel Neuer got his hands on a rare prize afterwards, swapping his shirt for Effzeh coach Steffen Baumgart’s fabled flat cap. Leipzig continued their positive steps under Domenico Tedesco, winning a first Bundesliga away game of the season (and their first since emerging victorious at now-second-tier Werder Bremen in April last year), 2-0 at Stuttgart. With new Red Bull technical director Mario Gomez looking on from the stand, there was concern for Dominik Szoboszlai, who pulled up in the warm-up with an apparent thigh complaint and is due an MRI to assess the damage. After six straight losses in the Bundesliga alone Wolfsburg stemmed the flow, but hardly in glorious fashion, being held to a goalless draw at home by Hertha. “It isn’t enough,” admitted goalkeeper Koen Casteels, while for the visitors Fredi Bobic addressed his first general meeting since becoming the club’s managing director of sport. He denied accusations of cronyism in appointing Tayfun Korkut as coach (“he’s not my buddy”) and while remaining sanguine, emphasised a need for progress. “I want to see development,” said Bobic, intimating he would assess Korkut’s impact at the season’s end. History was made at Mainz, who beat Bochum 1-0, with Bo Svensson receiving his fourth yellow card of the season and thus becoming the first Bundesliga coach to be suspended for accumulation of bookings - he’ll be absent from the touchline for Saturday’s trip to Fürth. Defender Stefan Bell, the team treasurer, will be reminded by his teammates to collect the appropriate fine from the boss. “Of course he has to pay up,” said midfielder Kevin Stöger, “and I told him that right after the game.”",Sport/Football,Sommer’s heroics not enough as Gladbach left looking over their shoulder | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/17/sommers-heroics-not-enough-as-gladbach-left-looking-over-their-shoulder
1/17/2022,"What’s not to love about Yellowjackets (Sky Atlantic), a series largely driven by the central mystery of which teenage girl has been eaten, and who ordered the eating? The US horror/thriller/drama, which is also truly a comedy (is it so wrong to laugh at an exploding plane?), has acquired a big following over the course of its first season. It tells the story of a girls’ high-school football team, whose plane crashes while they’re travelling to a national tournament, leaving survivors stranded in the wilderness, having to fight for their lives. Think of it as a hybrid of The Craft and The Island with Bear Grylls, or Lost – with intentional jokes – plus a hint of Big Little Lies, if that had more of an interest in cannibalism than property porn. I can’t remember the last time a TV series offered such unadulterated and outrageous fun. It even manages to navigate one of contemporary television’s most irritating trends, the split timeline, with style and panache. Half of the action takes place in 1996, starting out as a retro teen drama in the run-up to the crash, morphing into a folk-horror gorefest once the girls (and the odd boy or two) are right there in the thick of it. The other half takes place 25 years later, in the present day, as some of the women who made it out alive have to work out who knows what about the terrible things they did while they were stranded, and who is trying to blackmail them about it.  But, really, Yellowjackets is its own invention, a macabre and amusing one. It shares the spirit of those mid-to-late-90s teen films, such as Scream and The Faculty, in the way it juggles horror and humour; and it places near equal emphasis on the small teenage dramas, such as stolen boyfriends and new crushes, and the hunger and desperation of trying to live in an inhospitable, and possibly haunted, environment. It plays with supernatural elements without ever leaning too heavily into them, leaving us with the notion that what is within us is the scariest thing of all. Karyn Kusama directed the pilot episode and executive produces; she is responsible for the perpetually re-evaluated and underrated film Jennifer’s Body, and this shares a lot of its knowing tone. The cast is brilliant, the younger actors impeccably matched to their older counterparts. It’s a nostalgia fest for 90s lovers, with Juliette Lewis and Christina Ricci putting in their best performances in years. Lewis is outstanding as the wild and troubled Natalie, while Ricci is in danger of creating an iconic villain – if you see her as a villain, though there are moments in which she verges on the heroic – in the fabulously unhinged Misty. Tawny Cypress is Taissa, an ambitious politician in the making whose trauma from the crash continues to manifest itself in strange and uncanny ways. The reliably wonderful Melanie Lynskey is pitch perfect as present-day Shauna, stuck in a domestic trap of her own creation but destructively desperate to break out of it, and suspiciously capable of coolly culling the rabbits in her garden. While there is a suggestion that dark forces surround their wilderness days, and the boundaries of reality are stretched – particularly when mixing hooch made from rotten berries with mushroom stew – the series holds our attention by rationing the reveals, carefully drip-feeding information about who may or may not have made it out, and by hinting at whatever gruesome business went down. While we know our central four characters survived into the present day, the identity and whereabouts of the others are not yet clear. Fan forums are teeming with theories and speculation. Who is the girl who appears to have been sacrificed? Who is the Antler Queen, conducting her acolytes? What happens to the baby? What do Lottie’s visions mean? What about Jackie? Was Adam really a random, handsome guy, who just happened to be everywhere that Shauna was? And just happened to be a little bit of a modern-day Yellowjackets fanboy? The impending season finale, which can’t come soon enough, should answer at least some of those questions. It has already been renewed for a second season, and rightly so. I have recommended Yellowjackets to a lot of people, and, up until this point, it has had a very strong hit rate. My only concern is that it will leave us hanging, that, with more seasons to go, we might have to wait a Lost length of time to get proper answers. But, then again, with Misty on the rampage and Natalie out for revenge, I can think of worse things to do than strapping in for the ride.",Arts/Television & radio,"Juliette Lewis, Christina Ricci and teen cannibals: why Yellowjackets is the most fun TV show in forever",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/17/yellowjackets-in-class-of-its-own-teen-and-middle-age-angst-folk-horror-gorefest
