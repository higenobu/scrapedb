5/3/2022,"Deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlikely to deter those in northern France hoping to cross the Channel in small boats, according to a survey that found that three-quarters said they would still try to make the journey. The snapshot survey of more than 60 asylum seekers in Calais and Dunkirk was carried out by the charity Care4Calais, which provides practical support to asylum seekers in both northern France and across the UK. When the UK government announced plans to offshore some asylum seekers to Rwanda on 14 April, ministers emphasised that the controversial scheme would act as a deterrent to asylum seekers planning to cross the Channel in small boats. Asylum seekers who talked to Care4Calais said they were still prepared to take their chances. “I’m willing to risk it,” said one. “Everyone is scared in the camp but I don’t think it will affect them [the decision to cross the Channel].” Many of those interviewed fled Sudan or South Sudan and were horrified at the prospect of being flown back to a country not far from the starting point for their journey, especially after enduring the difficulties of passing through Libya, where many had to deal with traffickers, and making the dangerous crossing across the Mediterranean to Italy. “Rwanda is not good. It’s for animals, we take danger to get a safe life,” said another asylum seeker who participated in the survey. On Sunday, more than 200 people crossed the Channel in small boats after an 11-day pause due to poor weather, although the government claimed the absence of these crossings was evidence that its Rwanda plan was already having a deterrent effect. The most recent crossings, prior to Sunday’s resumption of small-boat activity on the Channel, was on 19 April, when 263 people crossed in seven boats. The offshoring plans are the subject of several legal challenges including one from Care4Calais, PCS and Detention Action. They are challenging the failure to publish details of the policy and the government decision to penalise asylum seekers based on irregular entry to the UK. Care4Calais has launched a crowdfunder for the legal action and has condemned the impact of the plans on asylum seekers on both sides of the Channel. The charity is one of several to raise the alarm that since the government announced its plans to offshore people to Rwanda dozens of asylum seekers are reported to have gone missing from hotels across the UK where the Home Office is accommodating them, because they are fearful of being rounded up and put on a plane to Rwanda. Sam Jonkers, a volunteer at Care4Calais, knows of some refugees who have vanished from hotels and says she has been deluged with text messages from asylum seekers fearful of being offshored. “The Rwanda plans are devastating for people who have left such dangerous countries and had such difficult journeys to reach the UK,” she said. “I have received hundreds of text messages from terrified asylum seekers; they can’t sleep at night because they are so worried.” One message states: “I couldn’t sleep. So frightened about what we expect to happen to us in the coming days with the Rwanda decision.” Another said: “I now think there is no such thing as human rights anywhere in the world, Neither in Iran, UK or anywhere.” While about a quarter of respondents to the Care4Calais survey in northern France said the Rwanda offshoring announcement would make them consider staying in France and seeking asylum there, many said they would continue with their plans to reach the UK. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, condemned the impact on asylum seekers in the UK of the Rwanda announcement, saying: “The government is failing in its duty of care to people in the asylum system by not recognising the devastating impact the threat of being expelled to Rwanda is having on them.” He said the government was simply treating asylum seekers it hoped to offshore as “human cargo”. Maddie Harris, of the Humans for Rights Network, is also aware that some asylum seekers have vanished from hotels since the offshoring announcement was made. She warned that many asylum seekers in the UK could go underground to avoid being offshored. “This is a policy that trades human life for money,” she said. “It is forcing people out of the asylum system into destitution due to fear of removal, drastically increasing the risk of exploitation.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “This world-leading migration and economic development partnership will overhaul our broken asylum system, which is currently costing the UK taxpayer £1.5bn a year – the highest amount in two decades. There is nothing in the UN refugee convention which prevents removal to a safe country. Under this agreement, Rwanda will process claims in accordance with national and international human rights laws.”",News/UK news,"Small boat asylum seekers undeterred by Rwanda plan, survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/02/small-boat-asylum-seekers-rwanda-uk-france-survey
5/3/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing ridicule after he appeared confused about the location of his campaign activity in north-east England. In a since-deleted tweet, the prime minister called for his followers to vote Conservative in Thursday’s local elections and stated that he was in Teesside where the Conservatives are “delivering a massive programme of investment as part of our plan to level up the whole of the UK”. Many on Twitter were quick to point out that the prime minister was in Whitley Bay, which is in North Tyneside and not Teesside, about 40 miles away. Alan Campbell, MP for Tynemouth and opposition chief whip retweeted the post and said: “The PM believes he was campaigning in Teesside. Actually he was in Whitley Bay North Tyneside.

5/3/2022,"Donald Trump’s “impenetrable” border wall has resulted in increased migrant deaths and devastating injuries from falling, according to a new study that analyzed the effect of the new barriers on a southern California hospital. The US replaced more than 400 miles of existing barriers that were between six-17ft tall with a 30-ft steel wall, and added nearly 50 miles of new barrier under the former president, who campaigned on the promise of “securing” America’s borders and routinely demonized migrants. The wall has been far from Trump’s promise of being “virtually impenetrable” – smugglers breached what he called the “Rolls-Royce” of barriers more than 3,000 times since its construction. Though the former president said his wall “can’t be climbed”, migrants have continued scaling the barrier, facing great peril. Last month a woman died while attempting to scale the wall in eastern Arizona after her leg became trapped in a climbing harness and she was left hanging upside down. A study, published in the Jama surgery journal on Friday, found an unprecedented increase in the number of falls from the border wall in San Diego and Imperial counties. The report is one of the first efforts to calculate the effects of Trump’s wall on migrants, according to the Washington Post, as federal officials don’t track deaths and injuries related to falls from the barrier. The University of California San Diego trauma center, which treats patients with border wall injuries, saw a five-time increase in the number of people admitted with falling injuries from 67 cases between 2016 and 2018 to 375 cases between 2019 and 2021. During that same time, the number of deaths rose from zero to 16, according to the report, which cites data from the San Diego county medical examiner’s office. Trauma doctors say the rise in injuries is related to the increase of the height of the border wall. “The height increase of the border wall along the San Ysidro and El Centro sectors was touted as making the barrier ‘unclimbable,’ but that has not stopped people from attempting to do so with consequential results,” said Amy Liepert, an author of the study and medical director of acute care surgery at UC San Diego Health. “This is an unseen public health crisis happening right now.” Most of the patients the hospital treated had “significant brain and facial injuries or complex fractures of the extremities or spine”, many of which required “intensive care and staged operative reconstructions”. Because patients largely did not have health insurance they were ineligible for rehabilitation centers or physical therapy, and had longer hospital stays. The costs of the increase in patients was more than $13m, and further burdened the trauma center as it grappled with rising Covid cases amid the pandemic, according to the study. “The care of these injured immigrants is not only a humanitarian problem but also a public health crisis that further worsened trauma center bed capacity, staff shortages, and professionals’ moral injury,” the authors wrote. The taller border wall has made what was already a perilous journey for migrants even riskier. At least 7,000 people are believed to have died along the US-Mexico border since 1998, the Guardian reported in 2021.",News/World news,Trump’s border wall has resulted in ‘unprecedented’ increase in migrant injuries and death,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/trump-border-wall-expansion-increase-injuries
5/3/2022,"An investigation into an “extraordinary breach of security” is under way after an intruder pretending to be a priest reportedly spent the night eating and drinking with soldiers at a barracks close to Windsor Castle. Police were alerted to reports of an intruder at Victoria Barracks on Sheet Street, Windsor on Wednesday, while the Queen was at Sandringham for Easter. The soldiers had reportedly been approached at the gate by the man, who said his name was Father Cruise. He allegedly went on to spend the night eating and drinking with senior officers despite showing no identification or credentials. The man was also offered a bed for the night. Speaking to TalkTV, a source called the incident an “extraordinary breach of security” and said that it is believed the man “turned up at the gate in the evening … and claimed to be a friend of the battalion’s Padre Rev Matt Coles”. He was then invited in and offered food in the officer’s mess. The source added that once inside the man drank with the officers in the bar, enjoyed “banter with the lads” and told them tall stories of how he had served in Iraq. A spokesperson said that the incident will be “thoroughly investigated as a matter of priority” and that the army “takes this breach of security extremely seriously”. As the incident is now part of an ongoing investigation, the army stated it would be “inappropriate to comment further at this time”. A Thames Valley police spokesperson said they received a report of an intruder at Victoria Barracks in Sheet Street, Windsor, at 9.20am on Wednesday. They confirmed that “officers attended and removed the intruder from the barracks.

5/3/2022,"There are only two ways Manchester United can ease this miserable season. Win the last three matches and, if not, at least play some sparkling stuff that offers hope for the future along the way. Tonight they achieved the first part of the quest to claim all their available final points, and also the second: this was as good as Ralf Rangnick’s team have performed during his interim stewardship. It was crowned by Raphaël Varane’s 72nd-minute goal, from a corner, 60 seconds before a walkout from the constituency disgruntled at the Glazer family. This was not observed in the numbers hoped for by the organisers: a sure sign of how the on-field product pleased home fans. United, though, might still end with a new lowest Premier League points total and, this term, have had three managers and hired a new incoming one – Erik ten Hag. Barring a near-miracle there will be no Champions League qualification and the post-game lap of “appreciation” following this final home outing was one, surely, that caused all players embarrassment. Game number 27 of Rangnick’s troubled interim managerial tenure began with an XI that had Juan Mata making a first league start this year – in place of Marcus Rashford, another sign of how his star has fallen. Cristiano Ronaldo, of course, has burnished his reputation following his return to the English game and there was no surprise when he jinked in behind Brentford’s rearguard and chested down a cute Diogo Dalot cross. Now, though, came a collector’s item: the usually clinical No 7 went to fire past David Raya and slipped, letting the visitors off the hook. This came after Thomas Frank’s side nearly scored barely three seconds after kick-off when Bryan Mbeumo ran on to Christian Eriksen’s laser-like pass, Alex Telles’s challenge saving United from the direst of beginnings. A throw-in, a corner from the right and one from the left ensued for Brentford, United continuing to scramble to clear. This seemed to augur well for the visitors. But then the hosts struck. Dalot is a definite force when roving into space ahead of his right-back zone. He found Anthony Elanga and what occurred next was the type of 100mph-move craved by United enthusiasts. The winger zipped forward and pulled the ball back across Raya for the hurtling-in Fernandes to crash home a volley for his 10th league goal of the season. Frank instructed his players to be “cool” and they proved unshaken. Eriksen hit a 20-yard stinger that David de Gea needed two attempts to grab, while Rico Henry’s marauding was scattering United’s flaky defence. One raid had the left wing-back feeding the effervescent Eriksen and when he dropped the ball on to Ivan Toney’s head, a more ruthless finisher might have equalised. Midway through the half a verse or three of “stand up if you hate the Glazers” was answered by many supporters getting to their feet, in what has become a familiar sight during the 17 years of the Americans’ ownership. There was, however, a happier vibe around the stadium simply because United were winning and zipping about like players who were far from maligned. Mata was one of the leaders of this gang, his smart play including a one-two with Ronaldo that ended with the Spaniard smacking an effort only marginally wide. Ronaldo thought he had doubled United’s lead after he fired home Mata’s cross before half-time but his finish was ruled offside following a VAR check. At the break, this had been a contest of two attractive attacks against two questionable defences. Further evidence of this came when Eriksen – surely worth a look as a summer free transfer for United – floated a free-kick all the way over a dozing United to Toney, who should have done better with his volley. Ten Hag’s work has to start with the players protecting De Gea as, at kick-off, the goals against column showed 52 goals conceded – the poorest record of the division’s top nine. That number includes goals scored from midfield, of course. A driving Eriksen run from this region forced Nemanja Matic to yank the schemer down. Eriksen’s attempt from the free-kick was one of those wobbly, knuckleball affairs and De Gea had to shift feet and hands smartly to repel this. But now came Ronaldo’s moment. Dalot’s ball fanned away from him along the right yet he shoulder-heaved Henry aside and flitted into the area. The defender’s response was to lump Ronaldo over and Christopher Kavanagh pointed to the spot. The Portuguese smashed the penalty in for his 18th league goal of the season and United were cruising. Towards the end, Brentford offered the taunt of, “where’s your protest gone?” In a lost United campaign this was a backhanded compliment: the home team impressed for once.",Sport/Football,Raphaël Varane seals Manchester United’s easy victory over Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/02/manchester-united-brentford-premier-league-match-report
5/3/2022,"For a considerable amount of time over the past few months, Andy Murray did not even intend to step foot on a clay court this year. His primary goal was to maintain his body for the grass‑court season to come and the gruelling nature of clay‑court tennis could jeopardise that. In the end, though, Murray just could not stay away. After attaining a surprise wildcard into the Madrid Open, on Monday he played a solid, composed match to reach the second round with a 6-3, 6-4 win against Dominic Thiem. Murray will next face Denis Shapovalov, the 14th seed. “I played well,” Murray told Amazon Prime. “I thought Dominic was playing well at times but he’s obviously just started playing again as well so making a few more mistakes than usual. But I was happy with the way I played and I moved particularly well; that’s something I’ve been working on a lot the last four weeks and it changes the way I play the game.” The last time Murray and Thiem met each other on clay, almost exactly five years ago in 2017, Murray was the world No 1 and Thiem was on the cusp of establishing himself as arguably the second‑best clay-court player in the world for a short period. While Murray is ranked 78th and is years into his return from hip surgery, at No 91 Thiem is trying to recover from the nadir of his career. His struggles even pre‑dated his injury, with motivation issues following his maiden grand slam title victory at the 2020 US Open. As he searched for new motivation, Thiem badly injured his right wrist during a match last June and his comeback attempts have been beset by countless setbacks. In his rush to return swiftly, he reinjured his wrist and was forced to wear a new cast. Illness, a right‑knuckle injury and then even a positive Covid test right after his comeback match have all continually delayed his return. Three tournaments into his comeback, Thiem arrived in Madrid still yet to win a match. After such a major wrist injury, his forehand has been the central issue. It was a nonentity in his opening matches and he only began to unleash towards the end of his first‑round defeat in Estoril last week. Against Murray, Thiem was comfortable enough with his wrist to unleash enormous forehands from the beginning, but he is striking those forehands with significantly less topspin than the vicious, heavy stroke at his peak. The consequence was a constant stream of unforced errors among a smaller proportion of winners. In that context, Murray played a solid match and he did most things as well as he could have hoped. He kept his unforced errors extremely low against an erratic opponent, he served very well under pressure and he used his drop shots and delicate lobs to move Thiem from his position far beyond the baseline. Murray was positive throughout and with this performance he has earned another day in the tournament to see how far he can push himself. In the midst of his own comeback, it is not often that Murray is the more match fit and physically robust player on the court. For Thiem, these early stages of his return have highlighted the task ahead as he also tries to return to the top of the sport and Murray was the first to acknowledge it as they embraced at the net. “It’s great to see you back,” he said. “Keep going. It takes a lot of time but you’ll be fine.” Earlier in the day, Cameron Norrie, the ninth seed, reached the second round with a tight 7-5, 7-5 win against Kwon Soonwoo of South Korea.",Sport/Sport,Andy Murray beats Dominic Thiem to prolong his adventure on clay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/02/andy-murray-beats-dominic-thiem-to-prolong-his-adventure-on-clay

At the halfway mark of the six-week federal election campaign, the primary vote for both Labor and the Coalition is largely unmoved, despite billions of dollars in election promises being made as voters tune into the contest, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll.

The Coalition is spruiking its existing Home Guarantee scheme, while Labor is promoting the party’s new “Help to Buy” scheme, a shared equity program. So, how do the two schemes compare?

5/3/2022,"At the end of April, a reporter and a cameraman stood outside the national parliament in Honiara. They were trying to film the Solomon Islands prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, as he walked in. But police arrived and chased them from the building. It prompted outrage among journalists. As they stood around discussing it afterwards, one said in Pijin: “Ma any cathedral,” meaning “as if it’s a cathedral” – a sacred place where filming is inappropriate. Everyone burst out laughing. This was a democratic country’s parliament, which journalists have a duty to cover. The incident was a sign of how secretive the government has been since the draft security agreement between China and Solomon Islands was leaked online. In my nearly 35 years in journalism, I have never experienced such a blackout. The government has refused to release the text of the deal. They have also refused to give interviews, while texts to longstanding contacts in the government go unanswered and calls unreturned. Sogavare seems to think the local media have joined forces with foreign entities to attack him personally or his government’s decision to switch allegiances to China. He refuses to be interviewed by local media and often attacks the media on the floor of parliament. Sources outside Solomon Islands are afraid to say anything too strong, in case it affects their ability to visit Solomon Islands again, given Covid restrictions mean the government has to grant personal exemptions to travel to the country. There is also fear of ridicule and online bullying on Facebook if anyone takes a certain position on the debate about China. Solomon Islands is experiencing the closing of doors and controlled dissemination of information from the prime minister’s office. This been seen for years in nearby Fiji but is new to Solomon Islands media. Since independence, the media in Solomon Islands has enjoyed free access to our leaders. The language on the floor of parliament is also changing, with politicians blaming the media for causing the uprising among the youth. At one stage, they even wanted to ban Facebook. Ironically, it has come as Solomon Islands remains the focus of international news day after day. Local reporters have been swamped by overseas media reaching out to them for content. . This has given the local media a voice and stronger participation in telling their story, with Australian and other foreign media unable to fly in because of the border closures. But it has come at a hard time for journalism in Solomon Islands. In the last six months the industry has lost nearly 10 journalists to public relations jobs. The two main daily newspapers have also shrunk from A3 to A4 size since Covid-19 hit. And many of their staff were laid off or left for financial reasons. It’s a sad state of affairs. Most of our journalists are trained in Fiji and some in Australia. And there are some who are taken straight out of high school or tertiary level to work in newspapers. As we deal with the attention our country is getting since the signing of the security agreement with China, it is now more important than ever to have a free press and a government that wants to communicate their actions to their people. Georgina Kekea, the president of the Media Association of Solomon Islands, is constantly writing to the prime minister’s about the need to give access to journalists, which is enshrined in our constitution. Since the draft agreement was leaked, we have seen arrivals of diplomatic envoys from overseas – the Australians, New Zealanders, Japanese and the big boys, the US. The joke among us is that it took a deal with China for the US to realise we exist. The first reaction of many Solomon Islanders when the US delegation turn up was: please remind them to clean up the second world war bombs killing people. The China security treaty has changed the political landscape, and tested the Solomon Islands government’s commitment to a free press. We now watch to see if it affects other important institutions here.",News/World news,"In 35 years reporting from Solomon Islands, I have never seen such secrecy as the last few months | Dorothy Wickham",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/in-35-years-reporting-from-solomon-islands-i-have-never-seen-such-secrecy-as-the-last-few-months
5/3/2022,"Ministers are to investigate whether British-made components identified as being used in Russian weapons systems are being deployed in Ukraine. A report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said that research conducted by the Ukrainian armed forces of Russian weapons systems recovered from the battlefield showed a “consistent pattern” of dependence on foreign-made components, in some cases British. An example it cited was the use of UK-manufactured high-frequency transistors in the Borisoglebsk-2 jamming system. The UK introduced an arms embargo against Russia in 2014 after its illegal annexation of Crimea – although there were reports that some export licences were still being issued – and banned the direct export to Russia of dual-use components, which have a civilian or military use, at the beginning of March after the invasion of Ukraine. The Rusi report did not say when the components in question were likely to have been exported and there was no suggestion of wrongdoing by the manufacturers, but it raised concerns that parts made in the UK could still find their way to Russia. It said that western economic sanctions meant Moscow would become increasingly reliant on component-smuggling to ensure its jets, missiles and other hi-tech munitions can function. The Daily Telegraph reported that a Whitehall inquiry would be launched to look into UK components being used in Russian weapons systems. A government spokesperson said: “We have introduced the largest and most severe economic sanctions that Russia has ever faced, to help cripple Putin’s war machine, including by sanctioning key defence sector organisations, and banning the export of critical technologies. “The UK has one of the most robust and transparent export-control regimes in the world. We take all credible allegations of breaches of export control seriously and we will take further action if appropriate.” Boris Johnson was in India when the report was published, announcing that the government would ease arms-exporting licensing arrangements with New Delhi by issuing an open general export licence to India. Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds, the authors of the Rusi report, warned that Russia “has established mechanisms for laundering these items through third countries”, and they argued that India should be subject to specific restrictions. In response, the prime minister said he would close loopholes to ensure UK exports to India could not end up being used in Russian weapons.
