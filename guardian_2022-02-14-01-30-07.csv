2/14/2022,"Rudolph Giuliani, who was prominent in Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election result, is considering giving testimony to the congressional committee investigating the deadly January 6 Capitol insurrection, the New York Times reported on Sunday. The specter of evidence from Trump’s former attorney and close adviser about maneuverings inside the White House in early 2021 to prevent Democrat Joe Biden taking office comes at the end of an already turbulent week for the former Republican US president.  The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Trump took boxes of records, including top secret documents, with him to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida retreat, when he left office, in possible violation of strict government record-keeping laws. And an upcoming book from the New York Times’s Maggie Haberman claims that Trump periodically clogged White House toilets by attempting to flush away printed papers. Trump has denied the allegations. Sunday’s report, quoting three anonymous sources, says Giuliani, who is also the former mayor of New York city and a failed Republican candidate for president, is negotiating with the bipartisan select committee over giving evidence in person, or submitting a deposition, but adds that he has not yet agreed to cooperate. Giuliani is understood to have significant knowledge of Trump’s plotting to unfairly retain power, and is reported to have been at the center of an unprecedented plan to order the department of homeland security to seize voting machines in contested states. The Times article suggests Giuliani could be seeking to avoid a costly legal fight over a subpoena the committee issued last month, and trying to evade a criminal referral for contempt of congress, by dangling the promise of testimony. However, like other members of Trump’s inner circle, he has so far resisted efforts to get him to talk. Giuliani had been due to appear before the committee last Tuesday and, according to the Times, has been allowed to reschedule “at his request”. In November, Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser, pleaded not guilty to criminal contempt of Congress for his refusal to comply, while the House of Representatives has recommended charges for the former White House chief of staff in the Trump administration, Mark Meadows. Trump has railed against the bipartisan investigation into the aftermath of his election defeat, which included his inciting of the Capitol riot that claimed five lives. Several senior Republicans, meanwhile, including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, have criticized the party’s censure of Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney, the two Republican members of Congress sitting on the committee, and the Republican National Committee’s controversial characterization of the Capitol breach as “legitimate political discourse”. McConnell said: “It was a violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after a legitimately certified election, from one administration to the next.” He added that it was “not the job” of the Republican party to single out members “who may have different views from the majority”.",News/US news,Giuliani considers giving testimony to Capitol attack committee – report,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/13/rudy-giuliani-considers-giving-testimony-capitol-attack-committee
2/14/2022,"In December 2001, the US government was ramping up its “war on terror” and 19-year-old Murat Kurnaz was about to board a plane home from Pakistan to Germany, where the Turkish national had legal residency and lived with his parents in Bremen. Reportedly as a result of the Americans offering “bounties” for suspected terrorists, Kurnaz was arrested and detained in Guantánamo Bay without trial or evidence; he was only released in 2006, as a result of a passionate letter-writing campaign by his formidable mother, Rabiye, culminating in her lawyer taking their case to Washington DC and sensationally submitting a writ of habeas corpus in federal court: Murat Kurnaz v George W Bush. It is this harrowing true story to which German film-maker Andreas Dresen has given the Hollywoodised feelgood-underdog treatment, concentrating on Murat’s gutsy mum played – often for sentimental laughs – by German-Turkish comedian and TV personality Meltem Kaptan. Her lawyer, Bernhard Docke, is played by veteran Berlin actor Alexander Scheer, very much in the traditional style of the stressed, fallible but idealistic lawyer who gallantly takes up the impossible pro bono case (much like Albert Finney for Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich).  Dresen is a director known for tough, challenging movies including Cloud 9from 2008 and Stopped on Track from 2011, but here has gone to the bland commercial mainstream. This is a film that certainly pays a well-intentioned tribute to Rabiye Kurnaz’s courage and passion, but is sucrose and shallow. The film has admittedly some sharp things to say about the way the German government, keen to stay onside with the Americans, repeatedly disavowed all interest in Kurnaz on account of his (technical) Turkish nationality – and also about the Turkish government, which coldly regarded Kurnaz as a German problem. But tonally, the film relies on the essentially comic turn from Kaplan, and the anger and the tragic anguish that should be part of this story are watered down. Moreover, the English-language scenes in Washington DC are stilted, and the film bafflingly invents a Hollywood liberal called “Tim Williams” to take an interest in Rabiye’s case. A basically misjudged drama, though one with its heart in the right place.

2/14/2022,"An energy company has thanked “honest” customers who did not try to cash compensation cheques for trillions of pounds sent out in error. Compensation is being paid to tens of thousands of people who were left without power when severe “once in a generation” winds swept across the UK in November last year during Storm Arwen.  Northern Powergrid admitted on Sunday it did not mean to send out cheques for trillion-pound sums to 74 customers in the north of England, with some customers receiving more than £2.3tn. The energy firm blamed a clerical error in which the customers’ energy meter numbers were used instead of the amount payable. The mistake came to light when one customer contacted Northern Powergrid on Twitter to share a photo of the cheque he had received. Thank you for our compensation payment @Northpowergrid for the several days we were without power following #stormarwen Before I bank the cheque however, are you 100% certain you can afford this? #trillionpounds pic.twitter.com/z5MNc2Nxl1 He wrote: “Thank you for our compensation payment, Northern Powergrid, for the several days we were without power following Storm Arwen. Before I bank the cheque, however, are you 100% certain you can afford this?”. The picture shows the customer had been written a cheque for £2,324,252,080,110. The tweet accrued more than 27,000 likes in 24 hours, as others joined in to poke fun at the error. “Bank it! Then share it equally between us all,” one Twitter user wrote. “I think you own Northern Powergrid now,” another joked. Specsavers even got in on the joke, tweeting “Hang on a minute …” Hang on a minute... The supplier confirmed 74 of their customers with Halifax and Newcastle postcodes had been given compensation cheques with an incorrect payment amount. A spokesperson for Northern Powergrid said: “As soon as we identified the clerical error, which was caused by the electricity meter reference number being incorrectly quoted as the payment sum, we ensured all 74 customers’ cheques were stopped so they could not be cashed. “We have been investigating how this error happened and carrying out checks of previous payments. All indications are that this was an isolated incident. “We thank those customers who were honest and contacted us and we have been making contact directly over the weekend with all 74 customers affected to make them aware, apologise for the error and reassure them that a correct payment will be issued to them on Monday.”",News/Business,Northern Powergrid accidentally sends out compensation cheques for trillions of pounds,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/13/northern-powergrid-accidentally-compensation-cheques-trillions-of-pounds-storm-arwen
2/14/2022,"Fears of flying over Ukrainian airspace have led some airlines to scrap or divert flights as tensions between the west and Kremlin mount over a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Dutch carrier KLM cancelled flights to Ukraine after the Netherlands government issued a travel warning over the risks of flying in the region, while Germany’s Lufthansa said it was considering suspending air traffic.  A passenger plane operated by the Ukrainian charter airline SkyUp, which was on its way to Kyiv from Madeira in Portugal, was meanwhile diverted on Saturday to the Moldovan capital, Chișinău, after the plane’s Irish owner said it was banning flights in Ukrainian airspace. The Dutch are especially sensitive to the potential dangers of Ukrainian airspace after a Malaysia Airlines flight, en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam, was shot down over an area in eastern Ukraine held by Russia-backed rebels in July 2014, killing all 298 people onboard, including 198 Dutch citizens. An investigation by the Dutch Safety Board found that the BUK surface-to-air missile that downed the plane had come from a Russian military base. KLM said in a statement that its decision followed “adjusted travel advice to code red and an extensive safety analysis”. “KLM has not been flying over the eastern regions of Ukraine and Crimea since 2014,” the company added. “There are now no more KLM flights through Ukrainian airspace until further notice.” A spokesperson for Lufthansa told Reuters on Sunday: “Lufthansa is monitoring the situation in Ukraine very closely.” Governments of 39 countries have warned their citizens to leave Ukraine as soon as possible, according to the Ukrainian news site Novoe Vremya. Many foreigners were rushing to book flights after rumours that Ukrainian airspace may soon be closed. Mustafa Nayyem, Ukraine’s deputy infrastructure minister, said on Sunday the government had not closed the country’s airspace. “Closing the airspace is a sovereign right of Ukraine and the government has not taken this decision,” Nayyem wrote on Facebook. Nayyem said the majority of airlines continued to operate but some were facing difficulties with insurers, given fears of a Russian attack. “We expect that in the nearest time the situation will stabilise, but nevertheless the state is ready to support airlines and plans to offer additional financial guarantees to support the air travel market,” wrote Nayyem. Kyiv’s Boryspil airport said it continued to operate normally on Sunday afternoon. “As of today, almost all flights are on schedule and without changes,” the airport said in a statement. “Stay calm, and watch for possible changes in the schedule,” it added. Both KLM and Lufthansa began rescheduling flights in January to avoid airline crews having to stay in the Ukrainian capital overnight as the buildup of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border intensified. The Irish low cost airline Ryanair said in late January that it had reduced flights to and from the country.",News/World news,Airlines divert flights from Ukraine airspace as invasion fears grow,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/13/airlines-divert-flights-from-ukraine-airspace-as-invasion-fears-grow
2/14/2022,"The unprecedented Russian military encirclement of Ukraine has not only brought closer the prospect of a devastating war in that country, it has also raised the risks of triggering an unintended wider conflict. The US and Nato have been adamant that their troops will not enter Ukraine no matter what happens, and the Pentagon has pulled out the 160 national guard soldiers who were acting as military advisers.  Even during the cold war, Washington and Russia made sure their forces did not clash, and Joe Biden has made clear he would seek to keep it that way. “That’s a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another,” Biden said. However, the massing of Russian troops in Belarus and the deployment of a substantial Russian naval force in the Black Sea, matched on a smaller scale by Nato land, sea and air reinforcements on the alliance’s eastern flank, means there is much far more military hardware in close proximity than is normal. And with proximity comes the increased danger of accidents and unintended consequences. “The risk of something going down like a mid-air collision, or a trigger-happy Russian or American, can really escalate things quickly,” said Danny Sjursen, a former army major and director of the Eisenhower Media Network. “You’re setting yourself up for accidents and miscalculation, and that’s when you can get out of control real quick, because there are domestic considerations both in Russia and in the United States. An American pilot dies – now what? I’m not saying that necessarily means we go to cataclysmic nuclear war but it escalates things.” The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CBS News on Sunday that the US had sought to be transparent about its troop deployments in eastern Europe in order “to avoid mistake miscalculation or escalation and also to send a very clear message to Russia we will defend every inch of Nato territory”. There is a long history of close encounters over the Baltic and Black Seas. Earlier this month US jet fighters scrambled to intercept Russian warplanes operating close to Nato airspace while British and Norwegian took off to monitor Russian aircraft flying into the North Sea. While Russia has shut off large parts of the Black Sea to conduct its manoeuvres, Nato navies have stayed out of the immediate vicinity for now, while building up their presence in the Mediterranean. If they do decide to go through the Bosphorus in a show of strength, or to safeguard commercial shipping, the risk will rise again. Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said the danger is further heightened by Russia’s suspected use of “GPS spoofing”, interference with the navigational equipment of other vessels. On several occasions recently, civilian ships traveling in the Black Sea have encountered mysterious GPS troubles that showed the vessels being in a different part of the Black Sea or even on land. It was widely though the incidents were caused by Russia testing its technology. “It raises the risk for naval vessels that are in the Black Sea, which we should remember is not that big, and it’s crowded,” Braw said. “There’s enormous shipping activity in the Black Sea, and so all those crews face the risk of having no GPS.” The transfer of combat troops from Russia’s far east to Belarus has not only significantly increased the imminent threat to Ukraine, but also made eastern European Nato members increasingly nervous. “The closest training ranges in Belarus are 150 to 200km from Vilnius or Warsaw,” said Kristjan Mäe, the head of the Nato and EU department at Estonia’s ministry of defence. “This is a Russian force posture that hasn’t been there previously.” A refugee crisis at the Polish-Russian border year led to a close encounter between the troops facing each other, with Warsaw complaining that Belarus forces opened fire in the direction of their soldiers. “We have to remember that the people who are actually out on the frontline are very young men and women and they face enormous responsibility,” Braw said. “Yes there is a chain of command but if there is some sort of provocation or aggression, intentional or unintentional, that is directed to them against them, then they have to respond.” The close encounters so far have occurred in peacetime. In the event of war, nerves will be far more on edge, communications could be hampered or flooded with disinformation. “We cannot be entirely confident that in the lead up to or during a conflict that Nato and Russia will be able to communicate, especially as current civil and military communication systems between them are not as robust or technically resilient as they should be,” Sahil Shah, a policy fellow at the European Leadership Network, said. “The world’s two largest nuclear-armed states have returned to the brink of conflict exactly 60 years after the Cuban missile crisis. If diplomacy is not pursued to the fullest extent, the risks of miscalculation and miscommunication could potentially pull in wider Europe into a devastating war. Without dialogue on how to manage de-escalation, it will be as if our leaders are running into a monsoon with newspapers over their heads.”",News/World news,Ukraine crisis: miscalculation could trigger unintended wider conflict,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/13/ukraine-crisis-miscalculation-could-trigger-unintended-wider-conflict
2/14/2022,"A new British dating app is promising to eradicate Tinder Swindler-style romance fraud, which cost duped daters almost £100m last year, by ensuring that all members complete biometric ID verification before they digitally mingle. Fluttr, which claims to be the first UK online dating app to use such technology to improve user safety, is launching on Valentine’s Day in the hope of getting a boost from singletons looking to change their relationship status.  The issue of romance fraud, catfishing and fake profiles has been put into the spotlight following the release of Netflix documentary The Tinder Swindler, which tells the true story of a man who went to extraordinary lengths to scam women for millions after meeting them online. The pandemic, when online dating was the only mixing that was allowed, has driven a huge surge in scams costing those duped £92m in the UK last year. “We want to rid the world of Tinder Swindlers and create a safe space free from the fake profiles used to defraud, catfish and abuse online daters,” said Rhonda Alexander, the chief executive and co-founder of Fluttr. “We’re reclaiming the fun of online dating by using digital ID verification and AI technology to create an environment that is secure enough for people to do everything from connecting with real people to falling in love.” According to the UK’s cybercrime and fraud reporting centre, Action Fraud, 8,863 cases were reported to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau between November 2020 and October last year. This is a 27% increase on the previous annual figure of 6,968 cases, which span simple acts of deception to organised scamming operations involving fake video calls and websites, the previous year. Daters who strike up online relationships between Christmas and Valentine’s Day tend to be the most susceptible to romance fraud, according to official figures. “Requests for money often are highly emotive, such as criminals claiming they need money for emergency surgery, medical care, or to pay for tickets and travel documents to visit the victim if they are overseas, even a debt that must be paid urgently,” says Richard Bromley, fraud risk manager at banking and payment app Revolut. “The scammers often pretend to work overseas, in the military, as a doctor or in an oil rig.” Fluttr has partnered with digital verification firm Yoti, which has clients including the NHS, Post Office and National Union of Students, to ensure all would-be daters are providing the correct personal details matched to government-issued documents. The subscription-only service, which says it will not run in-app ads or store user data, is looking to drive sign-ups with a promotional offer of £9.99 a month with the typical price planned to be £14.99. The company is majority owned by Ethical Social Group, a UK-based technology company that aims to positively change social media platforms. It is funded by a small group of mostly UK-based private investors.",News/Technology,UK dating app Fluttr aims to beat the ‘Tinder swindlers’ with biometric ID,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/13/uk-dating-app-fluttr-aims-to-beat-the-tinder-swindlers-with-biometric-id
2/14/2022,"A doctor has been arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a child patient, prompting a widespread police investigation into his conduct at two hospitals in the West Midlands. The Royal Stoke university hospital in Stoke-on-Trent and Russells Hall hospital in Dudley have both opened up helplines for parents of children who may have been treated by the 34-year-old, as well as past patients.  Staffordshire police confirmed the arrest without naming the man or his occupation, saying he had been bailed pending further inquiries. He was arrested in December on suspicion of sexual offences, the force said. Officers had previously investigated the same man in 2018 “at which time there was insufficient evidence to take further action”, a force spokesperson said. He is no longer working as a doctor. According to the Sunday Times, which first reported the case, hundreds of files, including those of vulnerable adults, are being reviewed as part of what police have called Operation Anzu. At least 109 have been identified as cases of concern, among them nine potential child victims, the paper claimed. Concerns were first raised about the doctor in 2018 when the parents of a vulnerable female raised concerns about his examination of her at Royal Stoke, where he worked in the accident and emergency (A&E) department, the Sunday Times reported. An inquiry identified further concerns and Staffordshire police began an investigation. The doctor was suspended for about 12 months. He returned to work in 2019 after police dropped the investigation because of lack of evidence. In 2020, he moved to Dudley, where he worked in both A&E and obstetrics and gynaecology, before a complaint was made against him last year. The Staffordshire force has reported itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct in regards to its 2018 investigation. An IOPC spokesperson said: “We assessed a referral from Staffordshire police in December and decided on the information available that the force should continue to deal with the matter.” The doctor was excluded from the Dudley Group NHS foundation trust in March last year and restrictions were put on his practice by the General Medical Council. He was suspended from practising in October. Staffordshire police and the NHS formally established Operation Anzu in December when he was arrested. Operation Anzu is focusing initially on reviewing the clinical records of children seen by the doctor but the hospitals will then consider the records of patients aged 18 to 25, the Sunday Times said. The doctor saw more than 800 patients at the Dudley hospital between August 2020 and March last year, including more than 350 children. Parents of potential victims are to be sent letters advising them how to contact the operation. These cases have been identified by a specialist review of medical records for patients seen by the doctor. The medical directors of the two hospital trusts said the doctor no longer worked there and they were working with police and could not make further comment. The Care Quality Commission said it was aware of the case. The watchdog’s deputy chief inspector of hospitals, Fiona Allinson, said: “We continue to liaise with the police and both trusts regarding these concerns to ensure people’s safety.” The University Hospitals of North Midlands trust said it had set up a helpline for concerned patients on 01782 672540. A separate helpline for patients at the Dudley hospital can be contacted on 01384 322 311.",News/UK news,West Midlands doctor arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting child patient,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/13/west-midlands-doctor-arrested-on-suspicion-of-sexually-assaulting-child-patient
