12/29/2021,"Covid-19 daily case numbers in New South Wales have almost doubled to 11,201 as the premier, Dominic Perrottet, insists he does not regret pushing ahead with eased restrictions when the Omicron variant arrived in the state earlier this month. The spike in cases on Wednesday was coupled with another jump in hospitalisations. In NSW there are now 625 people in hospital with the virus – up by 68 compared to Tuesday and by 323, or more than double, from a week ago.  The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced on Wednesday that her state would drop its controversial requirement for interstate arrivals to receive a PCR test before crossing the border. Instead, from 1 January arrivals will only need to have a negative rapid antigen test. The policy has been the subject of criticism from the NSW government, which has put much of the blame for long Covid testing lines and result delays on the pressure on the system caused by holiday makers. Perrottet told Sydney radio station 2GB that interstate travellers were “nudging 30%” of the total number of daily tests in the state, which on Wednesday was 157,758. The NSW government announced this week that it had placed an order for 20m rapid antigen tests, which are expected to arrive by the end of January. Perrottet said the government would investigate whether it could provide the tests free, amid increasing pressure on PCR testing. On Wednesday he again urged people not to line up for a test if they did not feel sick, saying most of the centres were at “full capacity” over the holiday period. “I know this runs counter to everything we’ve been saying over the last two years in relation to testing, so I know we’re going through an adjustment phase [but] there are many people who are lining up for tests who do not need them,” he said. The dramatic rise in cases – after the arrival of the Omicron variant – is proving to be the first significant test of Perrottet’s leadership since he replaced the former premier, Gladys Berejiklian, in October. Perrottet has sought to convince NSW residents that living with Covid is an inevitable development and insisted that hospitalisations from the virus, not case numbers, should be the focus. After case numbers began to rise in early December, Perrottet pushed ahead with easing restrictions, removing the use of QR codes in some retail venues and indoor mask mandates. The premier was forced to back-track before Christmas as Omicron became the dominant variant in the state and the number of health workers furloughed either with the virus or by isolation orders rose to about 1,500. But on Wednesday Perrottet insisted he did not regret easing restrictions “at all”. “We’ve always said as we open up, case numbers will increase,” he said. “These are the difficulties we’ll go through [but] despite this [NSW] is in a very strong position, and I’m very confident about 2022.” Covid case numbers have shot up across Australia amid the Omicron variant. On Wednesday Victoria recorded 3,767 new cases of Covid, up from 2,738 the day before.",News/World news,"NSW daily Covid cases surge to 11,201 as Perrottet stands by decision to ease restrictions",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/nsw-daily-covid-cases-surge-to-11201-as-perrottet-stands-by-decision-to-ease-restrictions
12/29/2021,"Dominic Thiem, beaten men’s singles finalist in 2020, is out of next month’s Australian Open after failing to recover from a long-standing wrist injury. The 28-year-old Austrian, who has not played since suffering the injury at the Mallorca Open in June, was unable to defend his US Open title this year. Thiem soared to No 3 in the world until the injury halted his progress and relegated him to his current ranking of 15.  Thiem was beaten in the fourth round of the 2021 Open in three straights by Grigor Dimitrov, while the year before he was beaten in five sets in the final at Melbourne Park by Novak Djokovic. He will begin his 2022 season on his preferred surface of clay at the Cordoba Open in Argentina at the end of January. “I will miss the Australian fans, but I will be back (there) in 2023,” he said on Twitter. “We believe this is the right decision in order to have a good return to competition. “For the moment I will remain in Austria for a few more days and then head to practise outdoors and get ready for my first event of the season.” Not for the first time in recent years, the Australian Open will be missing a number of top players, with more arriving short of match practice and fitness. On the men’s side, 20-time grand slam champion Roger Federer is still recovering from knee surgery, joining Stan Wawrinka and Milos Raonic on the sidelines. 2009 winner Rafael Nadal and Denis Shapovalov have both recently tested positive for Covid. On top of that, the participation of defending champion Novak Djokovic is not guaranteed as players respond to Australia’s vaccination requirements. In the women’s draw, 23-time grand slam champion Serena Williams heads the list of absentees, while Jennifer Brady, Karolína Plíšková, Karolína Muchová, and Bianca Andreescu are all set to miss out.",Sport/Sport,Dominic Thiem withdraws from Australian Open,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/29/dominic-thiem-withdraws-from-australian-open
12/29/2021,"The Challow Hurdle at Newbury has a fine record of pinpointing future chasing stars, with past winners including Denman, Champ, Taquin Du Seuil and Sunday’s Kempton winner, Bravesmansgame, all going on to land Grade Ones over fences later on in their careers, and Wednesday’s race looks like one of the stronger renewals in recent seasons. Stage Star has not put a foot wrong in two starts over hurdles and he stopped the clock in a decent time when winning over course and distance in November. Lossiemouth, too, is unbeaten over timber this term after progressing rapidly from an Ascot handicap in October, while Gordon Elliott’s Gringo D’Aubrelle, the only Irish-trained runner in the field, will also attract plenty of support.  At the early prices, however, Dan Skelton’s mare, West Balboa (3.05), has to be the bet at around 7-1. Her jumping was impressively slick on the way to a 17-length win in a strong time at Warwick in November and she gets a handy 7lb allowance from her six opponents. Newbury 1.25 Heart Of A Lion was let down by his jumping when only third at Huntingdon last time. He has a big chance on the form of his successful chase debut in early November, however, and is likely to have had some serious schooling in recent weeks. Leopardstown 1.45 Run Wild Fred’s win in the highly competitive Troytown Handicap Chase in November is the strongest form on offer here and he looks overpriced at around 100-30 for the in-form Gordon Elliott stable. Newbury 2.00 Masters Legacy finished well from a long way back when going down by just a length over track and trip last time. A 3lb rise gives him every chance of going one place better.

12/29/2021,"Tony Blair considered asking the Queen to open the newly formed Northern Ireland assembly in 1998, newly released state papers show. A letter from the then prime minister’s principal private secretary, John Holmes, reveals that Blair accepted it was a “delicate issue” but “[did] not believe it would be inappropriate” for the monarch to be involved.  Details of exchanges relating to the opening are contained in documents held at the Public Record Office in Belfast, with hundreds of the files now being made public under the 30/20-year rule. Blair was keen for the Queen to open Stormont and asked one of his ministers to raise it in secret with the then Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) deputy leader, Seamus Mallon. The letter to Nick Perry at the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) on 21 September 1998 reads: “The prime minister agrees that we cannot assume that this will remain a sleeping dog. However, he does not believe that it would be inappropriate for the Queen to open the assembly and does not agree we should ourselves try to avert this possibility. Nevertheless, he recognises that this is a delicate issue for nationalist opinion.” “He therefore believes that as a first step Paul Murphy [an NIO minister] should talk to Seamus Mallon privately about arrangements for the opening, mentioning the possibility of the Queen, but in neutral terms, before raising it with [David] Trimble or making any other moves. We can take it from there, depending on Seamus’s reaction.” The then Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam, suggested it might help “see off controversy” if ideas that did not include the Queen were considered. A letter from Jonathan Stephens, a Labour official, said he had discussed the issue with Mowlam. He stated: “She was entirely content with the line being taken by No 10. But she also suggested that it might help see off controversy if we were ready to come forward ourselves with vibrant and exciting proposals for marking the devolution of full powers to the assembly in a way which did not necessitate the Queen’s involvement – eg children’s choirs, etc.” The Stormont assembly was established in 1998 but did not gain fully devolved powers until December 1999, mainly due to political disputes over IRA decommissioning of weapons. The newly released files also reveal that the historic moment when unionist politicians shared a conference room with Sinn Féin for the first time was described by officials as “something of a damp squib”. The peace talks, involving Northern Ireland political parties and the British and Irish governments, took place in 1997 after Labour’s victory in the general election that year and a new ceasefire by the IRA. The declassified papers reveal that on 15 September 1997, Mowlam challenged Sinn Féin’s leadership about an IRA interview in An Phoblacht, a republican newspaper, in which the group said it had problems with sections of the Mitchell principles, which committed all parties to exclusively peaceful means. The minutes record the Sinn Féin negotiator Martin McGuinness telling the plenary meeting that “Sinn Féin could not guarantee that the IRA would support whatever was agreed in the talks”. A talks summary from two days later reveals that the key event was the “unexpected arrival of the UUP (Ulster Unionist party) delegation, led by David Trimble”. The two parties were in the same room by the following week. It reads: “The purpose of the plenary – the hearing of the UUP’s indictment of Sinn Féin over the Mitchell principles – was something of a damp squib, particularly as the UUP’s address on their indictment contained no evidence to support their allegations. Nevertheless, a historic change had occurred.” The files also revealed that former British prime minister John Major admitted privately that he did not believe the IRA could be beaten militarily. According to a memo, he made the comments at meeting in Downing Street in February 1992.",News/UK news,Tony Blair considered asking Queen to open Stormont assembly,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/29/tony-blair-considered-asking-queen-to-open-stormont-assembly
12/29/2021,"For many people, placing a record on the turntable will always be the quintessential musical experience. Sliding a shiny black disc out of a gatefold sleeve and dust jacket, laying it on the turntable platter, then the unmistakable crackle and the low, almost imperceptible analogue rumble as the needle slides into the groove.  Before the digital revolution, vinyl was the premier choice for listening to music. But the format’s resurgence in popularity over the past few years shows no signs of letting up, with new figures predicted to show sales growing to their highest level in more than three decades. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), more than 5m vinyl albums have been bought in the UK over the past 12 months, up 8% on sales in 2020 and the 14th consecutive year of growth since 2007. By the end of the year, vinyl will have accounted for almost one in four album purchases – the highest proportion since 1990 – according to BPI estimates. But why? There are tactile, sensuous and theatrical qualities to vinyl that made it a unique format, said Andy Kerr, the director of product marketing and communications for Bowers & Wilkins, a British audiophile speaker maker. Popular streaming services used digital file compression to lower internet bandwidth that “tend to make the sound tinny”, Kerr said. “Vinyl is the opposite of that. It tends to make the sound lush and warm.” But Kerr said he did not think the renewed interest in vinyl was being led by audiophiles. “I do think a huge amount of what’s going on with vinyl is not about the sound at all, it’s about the theatre of it, it’s the experience of it,” he said. “The LP record forces you into that [experience], you don’t tend to skip every 30 seconds because you don’t like the way that the song is going, you tend to listen to it all the way through.” Tom Fisher, record buyer at Rat Records, a secondhand record dealer in Camberwell, south London, said lockdowns had led to “frustrated demand for music as a cultural thing”. “If you can’t go and see a band you might buy an album or T-shirt, [that satisfies you] in a way that digital doesn’t fulfil,” he said. Emphasising that his comments related to the secondhand trade in LPs, Fisher said: “The only thing I would say about the renewed interest in vinyl is that it is not really very good for creative music and art, because the interest in vinyl is retro.” A running joke in Rat Records was that it could never get enough copies of Rumours by Fleetwood Mac, The Wall by Pink Floyd or Born in the USA by Bruce Springsteen, all culturally mainstream products of a similar era. People were not interested in records made before about 1968 because they lacked a production quality that conveyed well on modern speakers and headphones, Fisher added. “I find it quite hard to understand why people are so interested in vinyl and when they are so interested in these cultural monoliths, like Rumours, when they could go and listen to some piece of underground hip-hop or something from some other part of the world that was never available before,” said Fisher. Ultimately, vinyl’s newfound success would eat itself, Fisher suggested. “If everybody wants records and they all want the same records then it can’t be really that cool and the vanguard are going to move on,” he said. Geoff Taylor, the chief executive of the BPI, Brit awards and Mercury prize, said: “It’s a great time to be a music fan, with wider choice on offer than ever before supported by great value. “Thanks to record label investment into new music and talent, fans can purchase and collect the music they most love on vinyl, CD and even cassette, whilst also enjoying access to over 70m songs to stream instantly whenever and how often they want, in turn enabling a new generation of artists to create music and sustain successful careers in a global market.” The BPI will report its final music consumption figures on 4 January 2022. 1 ABBA Voyage2 Adele 303 Fleetwood Mac Rumours4 Ed Sheeran =5 Amy Winehouse Back to Black 1 Olivia Rodrigo Sour2 Dave We’re All Alone in This Together3 Lana Del Rey Chemtrails Over the Country Club4 Queen Greatest Hits5 Coldplay Music of the Spheres (Based on year to date Official Charts data)",Arts/Music,Vinyl turns tables as UK sales take highest market share since 1990,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/29/vinyl-uk-sales-highest-market-share-since-1990
12/29/2021,"UK households face a hit of £1,200 next year as stalling wages and rising tax and energy bills cause a “cost of living catastrophe” in the spring, a leading thinktank has warned. Government measures, including the new social care levy on national insurance and the freezing of the personal income tax allowance, will combine with high inflation to make 2022 the “year of the squeeze”, the Resolution Foundation said.  It warned that in April the introduction of tax changes, with a new price cap on energy bills, will cost families £1,200 overnight. “The months ahead will not be easy for households who see their wages fall back as energy bills and taxes rise,” the report said. “As Omicron hopefully fades in the early months of 2022, we will come to realise the scale of the challenge posed to household finances.” UK inflation hit a 10-year high in November, and economists have suggested it will rise further in 2022. One of the biggest factors has been energy bills, which have been driven up by rising wholesale gas prices and the failure of many of the cheapest suppliers. Households have been shielded from some of the increases by an energy price cap, which means suppliers have to offer gas and electricity at or below a unit price set by the regulator, Ofgem. The cap is due to be reviewed in February and come into effect in April, and record wholesale gas prices in recent weeks have led to speculation that it could allow households bills to rise above £2,000. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, was locked in crunch talks with energy bosses on Monday, but this failed to deliver a breakthrough. The founder of Ovo Energy has warned that household bills will “almost certainly” double in April without government intervention. The Resolution Foundation’s calculations are based on an average rise of £600 in prices, which would take bills to about £1,900 a year. The thinktank said an increase in the price cap in April would have the biggest impact on low-income households as they spend more of their income on energy. It said the poorest households would see spending on gas and electricity rise from 8.5% to 12% of their earnings. Higher-income households will face a bigger hit from the government’s decision to freeze personal tax allowances at £12,570 a year, which was announced in March’s budget, and the 1.25-percentage point increase in national insurance to fund social care. The average cost for households of these changes will be £600, but for those households in the top 50% of earners, the national insurance rise alone will add an average of £750 to annual outgoings. The Foundation said wage growth had stalled in 2021 and in real terms wages were likely to fall for most of 2022. It forecast a rise of 0.1% over the year, once inflation was taken into account, but said it expected that by the end of 2024 real wages would be £740 a year lower than if the UK’s pre-pandemic pay growth had continued. The report called on the government to consider ways to mitigate rising living costs, including raising universal credit, holding down the price cap and temporarily removing VAT on energy bills. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “2022 will begin with Omicron at the forefront of everyone’s minds. But while the economic impact of this new wave is uncertain, it should at least be short-lived. Instead, 2022 will be defined as the ‘year of the squeeze’. “The overall picture is likely to be one of prices surging and pay packets stagnating. In fact, real wages have already started falling, and are set to go into next Christmas barely higher than they are now.” Of the £1,200 income hit in April, Bell said: “So large is this overnight cost-of-living catastrophe that it’s hard to see how the government avoids stepping in. “Top of the government’s new year resolutions should be addressing April’s energy bills hike, particularly for the poorest households, who will be hardest hit by rising gas and electricity bills.” Labour criticised Boris Johnson for failing to mitigate the cost-of-living crisis that is about to hit families and pensioners. “Heating bills are going through the roof, punishing tax rises are on the way, wages are stagnating, universal credit cuts have hit struggling families hard, all while prices in the shops are rising and inflation risks eroding the value of savings and pensions,” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow work and pensions secretary. Ashworth said Labour would help ease the burden by scrapping VAT on household heating bills over winter, and would not hit working families “with a punishing national insurance rise at the worst possible time”. Responding to the report, a government spokesperson said: “We know people are facing pressure with the cost of living – which is why we’re taking £4.2bn of decisive action to help. “This includes reducing the universal credit taper – a tax cut worth over £2bn – supporting households with their bills through the energy price cap, warm home discount scheme, winter fuel payments, cold weather payments, and household support fund, as well as freezing alcohol and fuel duty.”",Lifestyle/Money,UK households warned of ‘year of the squeeze’ as cost of living soars,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/29/uk-households-warned-of-year-of-the-squeeze-as-cost-of-living-soars
