1/21/2022,"In response to your letters (18 January), from my experience there are three kinds of parish or town council: the proactive, the reactive and the inactive. I should know as I spent 30 years as a councillor – 24 on a town council, as well as 18 on a district council and 16 on a county council, but not necessarily all at the same time. To bring English local government in line with the other three nations of the UK, we should complete the move started in the 1990s and replace the remaining district and county councils with unitary authorities, and offer enhanced powers to parish/town/neighbourhood councils. Then we should devolve more fiscal powers to local government in general as a precursor to setting up regional assemblies in England and creating a federal UK.  With more cash and power riding on the result of local elections and the chance to make a real difference in local communities, not only might voter turnout increase but also the willingness of ordinary citizens to get involved by putting themselves forward for election. Currently, most parish councils rely on co-option to fill vacancies and the turnout in tier one and tier two councils in elections that do not coincide with general elections is frankly often derisory.John MarriottNorth Hykeham, Lincolnshire  Your correspondents fail to recognise the real power of parish councils. These are statutory public bodies with unlimited powers to raise funds through taxation. Also, under “general powers of competency” (Localism Act 2011), they have the freedom to do anything that is not against the law. This creates opportunities and threats. At a local level, they have the freedom to benefit and strengthen communities through local initiatives and neighbourhood development plans. However, there is no regulatory framework to ensure that parish councils act within the law and there is little or no interest shown by the press or the public. In my experience, the lawful requirements as defined in the Local Government Act 1972 are often ignored. Likewise the Nolan principles. The example set by our current PM will surely encourage continued rule-breaking. My advice would be to value your parish council, but be very vigilant.Dr Trevor AugheyHatt, Cornwall  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/21/2022,"Your editorial (19 January) chimes with our charity’s recent experience of helping those who face an impossible choice between topping up the gas meter or putting food on the table. Our fear is that the removal three months ago of the £20-a-week increase in universal credit, just as the cost of living began to rise sharply, has slammed shut the window of opportunity to continue reducing the need for food banks.  Members of Feeding Britain’s social supermarkets are already showing signs of distress. People who were shopping every couple of weeks for low-cost food are now doing so daily or weekly. Among those who relied only on the option of low-cost food, there is a growing need for the help we can offer with gas and electricity costs as well. Two moves the government should make to rescue those households are to recalculate April’s benefit uprating so as to reflect the actual costs of living, rather than those of six months ago; and to both reform and extend the warm home discount to this group. In the absence of these moves, worse is indeed yet to come.Andrew ForseyNational director, Feeding Britain  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/21/2022,"Just over a quarter of an hour into The Puppet Master: Hunting the Ultimate Conman (Netflix), one of the contributors says something you cannot quite believe. She recalls how, in 1993, she chose to go on a road trip with two friends and a stranger called Rob: “That decision changed the next 10 years of my life.” At this point, we know we are watching a documentary about a fearsomely persuasive con artist, but even so: 10 years? By the end of this chilling, frequently astounding three-parter about how powerful lies can be when delivered with confidence – and specifically about the abusive behaviour known as coercive control – it makes perfect, awful sense.  The woman is Sarah Smith, who was studying at agricultural college in Shropshire when her boyfriend met a man who claimed to be an undercover MI5 agent. A fellow student had recently been arrested for IRA gun-running; now Smith and her pals were in danger, Rob said, because their housemate was suspected of similar activities. Rob told them they had to go on the run from the IRA, under his protection. They agreed to do so. Smith didn’t return home for another decade. Meanwhile, in 2012, teenage siblings Jake and Sophie Clifton were increasingly worried about their mum, Sandra Clifton. (The series hops back and forth, scrolling left and right along a timeline à la The Last Dance.) The behaviour of Sandra’s boyfriend, David, was progressing from troubling anomalies – having money but not apparently going to work; being reluctant to divulge his surname – to aggressive gaslighting that seemed designed to force the children to leave home. “Rob” and “David” were, of course, the same person: Robert Hendy-Freegard, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for a plethora of offences in 2005, before being cleared of the most serious one, kidnapping, on appeal two years later and released. That Sandra was bewitched by a man who had already been publicly identified as a ruthless deceiver – Jake and Sophie could have brought him down with a simple Google search, had they only known what to type in – is one of so many near misses and if-onlys in a series that makes your jaw drop wider and wider, without ever straying into prurient sensationalism. Tight storytelling combines with efficient dramatic reconstructions to take us through a twin narrative that barrels on like a thriller. Indeed, a movie dramatisation starring James Norton as Hendy-Freegard has begun filming. What makes The Puppet Master unforgettable, however, is its dissection of how coercive abuse works. Once fear or love, or a mix of both, has caused the victim to give the perpetrator their trust, all sorts of incredible lies can be believed and all kinds of humiliations endured. Smith, in particular, shows considerable courage in describing honestly how she was browbeaten into cutting herself off from her loving family, not communicating with them unless it was to demand ever-growing sums of money. Initially, it seems preposterous that anyone would believe a man who says: “I am an MI5 agent,” but Smith’s testimony proves that, in the hands of someone as appallingly talented as Hendy-Freegard, sensible people can make absurd choices and strong people can be broken. As Hendy-Freegard takes Smith on an indefinite tour of the UK, moving her from one “safe house” to another and isolating her more every time until her loved ones are abandoned altogether, the story goes to places much darker than Hendy-Freegard leeching her for cash. Much of the series’ power to grip comes from mounting revulsion at Hendy-Freegard’s deliberate, sustained cruelty. That said, it has heroes as well as a momentous villain. Chief among them is Peter Smith, Smith’s father, who saw through Hendy-Freegard immediately and, having failed to stop this man taking away his daughter, spent the next decade conducting what was often a one-man surveillance and intelligence operation, doing it old-school, his study wall covered in giant maps dotted with pins linked by string. He never gave up. Eventually, he got his girl back. Not everyone has been so lucky. We are told from the outset that Sandra’s kids, now young adults, have not seen her in person since she skipped town with Hendy-Freegard some years ago. His successful appeal against his kidnapping conviction was based on the claim that his victims were free to leave him at any time. That coercive control did not become a criminal offence in England and Wales until 2015 is The Puppet Master’s biggest if-only of all.",Arts/Television & radio,The Puppet Master: Hunting the Ultimate Conman review – astounding true crime TV,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/20/the-puppet-master-hunting-the-ultimate-conman-review-chilling-astounding-true-crime-tv-netflix

1/21/2022,"In terms of quality, the 1950s was a poor period for West German cinema, still recovering from the second world war, but it was also the time when a number of German actors became known internationally – among them Curt Jürgens, Romy Schneider, Horst Buchholz, Maria Schell, and Hardy Krüger, who has died aged 93. They often played “good Germans” to counterbalance the Nazi stereotypes in the allied films of the 1940s. The good-looking, boyish blond Krüger, having played romantic leads in lightweight films in his homeland, became the face of the new Germany most significantly in The One That Got Away (1957). This British film for J Arthur Rank, directed by Roy Ward Baker, and based on the true story of Franz von Werra, who escaped from an allied PoW camp, was one of the first to depict a sympathetic German character. Made only 12 years after the end of the war, the film forces the audience to identify with the German pilot, whose ambition is to get back to his squadron and cause more damage to Britain. This effect was achieved mainly through Krüger’s charismatic performance, both charming and cocky.  After this great success, Krüger was cast in two more British films for Rank, Bachelor of Hearts (1958) and Blind Date (released in the US as Chance Meeting, 1959). The former was a likable romantic comedy set in Cambridge, where Krüger, convincingly naive, is a German exchange student trying to understand the strange rituals of the university. Blind Date, in contrast, was a gritty thriller, directed by Joseph Losey, in which Krüger is a Dutch painter in London who becomes embroiled in a political scandal. It is striking that in all three of the Rank movies audiences were asked to sympathise with the foreign character against the British. Krüger’s international career now truly launched, the next two decades saw him in American, British, French, Italian and Spanish productions. In 1962, he made his Hollywood debut in Howard Hawks’s Hatari!, shot in east Africa, which gave Krüger second billing under John Wayne. Wayne heads an international team of hunters, with Krüger as the crack shot and rival of Gérard Blain for the attentions of Michèle Girardon. Krüger was so taken with Tanganyika (now Tanzania) that he built a small bungalow hotel on the site of the film’s location to which he could escape from time to time and where tourists could see the animals. He sold it in 1979 because of political unrest. In Sundays and Cybèle (1962), the surprise winner of the foreign language film Oscar, Krüger played a former pilot suffering from amnesia who forges a friendship with a young orphan girl (Patricia Gozzi) in a small town near Paris. But when they innocently spend Christmas together in the woods, he is suspected of assaulting her. The warm playing of Krüger and Gozzi as the odd couple helped counteract some of the self-conscious charm and aesthetics of Serge Bourguignon’s direction. In Robert Aldrich’s The Flight of the Phoenix (1965), Krüger was outstanding in a cast that included James Stewart, Peter Finch and Richard Attenborough. As one of the survivors of a plane that crash-lands in the Sahara, he convinces the others that he can build a single-engine plane from the wreckage. Krüger’s cool East German spy created a fine contrast to the nervous performance of Montgomery Clift (in his last role) as a CIA agent in the murky cold war thriller The Defector (1966). As a German captain in Stanley Kramer’s raucous comedy The Secret of Santa Vittoria (1969), set in an Italian village under German occupation, Krüger brought a lightness of touch missing from the other characterisations, especially the two leads, Anthony Quinn and Anna Magnani. Other notable appearances came in The Red Tent (1971), Paper Tiger (1975), Barry Lyndon (1975), A Bridge Too Far (1977) and The Wild Geese (1978), in the last of which Krüger played Pieter Coetzee, an Afrikaner mercenary. He was back in German uniform for one of his last roles, as Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in the US miniseries War and Remembrance (1988), based on Herman Wouk’s novel. Krüger was born in Berlin. His parents, Max Krüger, an engineer, and Auguste (nee Meier), were ardent supporters of Hitler and sent their son to an elite Nazi school. Like a majority of young German boys, he became a member of the Hitler Youth movement. “The scars on my soul survive,” Krüger said later. “An almost exaggerated desire for justice arose in me since that time.” Billed as Eberhard Krüger, he made his film debut in The Young Eagles (1944), one of the last films made in Nazi Germany, set mainly at an aircraft factory. Krüger played a young apprentice working overtime to help build planes for the war effort. On set, Krüger learned from older actors more about the horrors of Nazi rule. While still a teenager, in 1945 he was drafted into the SS “Nibelungen” Division. “I knew the war was lost,” he told the Bild newspaper in 2006. “I knew that there were concentration camps and that the Nazis were a bunch of criminals.” He deserted and was captured by American forces. Many years later, during the filming of the war epic A Bridge Too Far, in which he portrayed a Nazi general, Krüger wore a topcoat over his SS uniform between takes because he “hated that Nazi uniform” and so as “not to remind myself of my childhood in Germany”. From the early 1950s, Krüger appeared in two to three films a year, mainly escapist stuff strictly for home consumption – his sincere charm pervading them all. In 1953, the director Otto Preminger decided to make both an English and a German language version of the romantic comedy The Moon Is Blue. The German version, Die Jungfrau auf dem Dach, starred Krüger and Johanna Matz in the roles originally taken by William Holden and Maggie McNamara, and each couple made cameo appearances in the other film. Krüger thereafter increasingly pursued international roles. He had a second career as a writer of novels, short stories and memoirs. He also became a campaigner against rightwing violence. In 2001, Krüger was made an officer of the Légion d’honneur, one of the few German actors to have received the French decoration. Two marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his third wife, Anita Park, by a daughter, Christiane, from his first marriage, to Renate Densow, and by two children, Malaika and Hardy Jr, from his second marriage, to Francesca Marazzi.

1/21/2022,"The billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s brain chip startup is preparing to launch clinical trials in humans. Musk, who co-founded Neuralink in 2016, has promised that the technology “will enable someone with paralysis to use a smartphone with their mind faster than someone using thumbs”.  The Silicon Valley company, which has already successfully implanted artificial intelligence microchips in the brains of a macaque monkey named Pager and a pig named Gertrude, is now recruiting for a “clinical trial director” to run tests of the technology in humans. “As the clinical trial director, you’ll work closely with some of the most innovative doctors and top engineers, as well as working with Neuralink’s first clinical trial participants,” the advert for the role in Fremont, California, says. “You will lead and help build the team responsible for enabling Neuralink’s clinical research activities and developing the regulatory interactions that come with a fast-paced and ever-evolving environment.” Musk, the world’s richest person with an estimated $256bn fortune, said last month he was cautiously optimistic that the implants could allow tetraplegic people to walk. “We hope to have this in our first humans, which will be people that have severe spinal cord injuries like tetraplegics, quadriplegics, next year, pending FDA [Food and Drug Administration] approval,” he told the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council summit. “I think we have a chance with Neuralink to restore full-body functionality to someone who has a spinal cord injury. Neuralink’s working well in monkeys, and we’re actually doing just a lot of testing and just confirming that it’s very safe and reliable and the Neuralink device can be removed safely.” However, Musk has a history of overpromising about the speed of the company’s development. In 2019 he predicted that the device would be implanted into a human skull by 2020. Musk said the device would be “implanted flush with skull & charges wirelessly, so you look & feel totally normal”. He said people should think of the technology as similar to “replacing faulty/missing neurons with circuits”. “Progress will accelerate when we have devices in humans (hard to have nuanced conversations with monkeys) next year,” he said. Neuralink has previously released a video of a monkey that had been implanted with the chip playing the video game Pong using only its mind. The company, which counts Google’s parent company Alphabet among a series of well-known Silicon Valley backers, is also recruiting for a “clinical trial coordinator” to help build a team of people to run the trial and liaise with regulators.

1/21/2022,"A Canadian high school named after the Duke of York has announced plans to rename itself, in an attempt to distance itself from the growing controversy surrounding the Queen’s second son. The principal of Prince Andrew high school in the province of Nova Scotia told families on Wednesday to expect the change as the school looks for a name that “upholds our values as a safe and inclusive” space.  “The name of a school should be reflective of our school community … Our hope is to continue to build our identity as a positive, supportive and respectful community, with a name to match,” principal Craig Campbell wrote in an email. The high school of nearly 800 students was named in 1960 to commemorate the birth of Prince Andrew. While most students call the school “PA”, the recent accusations against the Duke of York mean the name is no longer tenable, the school said.  In the early 90s, Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of British media tycoon Robert Maxwell, met investment banker and financier Jeffrey Epstein. Their relationship was initially romantic, but it evolved into something more akin to Maxwell being a confidante and personal assistant.  Prince Andrew was reportedly introduced to Epstein through Maxwell in 1999, and Epstein reportedly visited the Queen’s private retreatin Aberdeenshire. Some have suggested the introduction was made earlier. A 2011 letter to the Times of London from the prince’s then private secretary, Alastair Watson, suggests Andrew and Epstein knew each other from the early 90s. Andrew, Maxwell and Epstein are seen together at DonaldTrump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Later that year, Epstein and Maxwellattend a joint birthday party at Windsor Castle hosted by the Queen. Andrew and Epstein holiday together and are pictured on a yacht in Phuket, Thailand, surrounded by topless women. The Times of London reported the prince’s holiday was paid for by Epstein. In the same year, Virginia Giuffre, then 17, claims to have had sexwith Andrew in Maxwell’s home in Belgravia, London. Giuffre, whose surname was Roberts at the time of the alleged incidents, says she slept with Andrew twice more, at Epstein’sNew York home and at an “orgy” on his private island in the Caribbean. Epstein is jailed for 18 months by a Florida state court after pleading guilty toprostituting minors. Soon after his release, Epstein is visited byAndrew in New York. The pair are photographed together in Central Park. Footageemerges years later, reportedly shot on 6 December, that appears to show Andrewinside Epstein’s Manhattan mansion waving goodbye to a woman from behind a door. Andrew quits his role as UK trade envoy following afurore over the Central Park photos. Allegations that Andrew had sex with Giuffre emergein court documents in Florida related to Epstein. The papers say she was forced to have sex with Andrew when she was 17, which is below theage of consent under Florida law. Buckingham Palace denies the allegations. The claims against Andrew are later struck from US civilcourt records following a federal judge’s ruling. Andrew is accused of sexualimpropriety by a second alleged Epstein victim, Johanna Sjoberg. She claims hetouched her breast at the billionaire’s Manhattan apartment in 2001.Buckingham Palace says the allegations are ""categorically untrue"". Epstein is found dead in his jail cell after being re-arrested and charged with sex trafficking. A medical examiner says the death was a suicide. A pilot on Epstein’s private jet later that month claims Andrew was a passenger on past flights with the financier and Giuffre. Andrew takes part in a disastrous BBC TV interview during which he claims he could not have had sex with Giuffre because he was at home after a visit to Pizza Express in Woking, and that her description of his dancing with her beforehand could not be true because he was unable to sweat, and that he had ""no recollection of ever meeting this lady"". After several days of negative reaction, Andrew announces he is to step back from public duties ""for the foreseeable future"". US prosecutor Geoffrey Berman gives a public statement suggesting there has been ""zero cooperation"" with the investigation from Andrew. After Berman again claims Andrew has ""completely shut the door"" on cooperating with the US investigation in March, lawyers for the prince insist he has repeatedly offered to cooperate and accuse US prosecutors of misleading the public and breaching confidentiality. Maxwell, who has seldom been seen in public in recent years, is arrested by the FBI on charges related to Epstein. Unsealed testimony from a 2015 civil case reveal a series of claims about her role in Epstein's sex-trafficking ring, including allegations that she trained underage girls as sex slaves.  US officials confirm that Prince Andrew has received court papers relating to a sexual assault civil lawsuit from Giuffre, seeking damages. Her lawyers had earlier said the duke had officially been served with the papers, but his legal team had disputed the claim. Two weeks later, a court in New York granted his lawyers permission to see the confidential settlement agreement between Giuffre and Epstein. The Metropolitan police in London say they are taking no further action after a review of the allegations that Prince Andrew assaulted Giuffre. In August, the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, had said “no one is above the law” and that she had asked her team to look at the material again. Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial ends with a guilty verdict on five of the six counts she faced. A judge in New York rejects Prince Andrew’s attempt to throw out the sexual abuse civil lawsuit brought against him by Giuffre. The prince's lawyers had attempted to argue that Giuffre’s 2009 settlement with Epstein shielded the duke from her taking legal action against him. Queen Elizabeth II strips her son of a range of military affiliations and royal patronages after more than 150 military veterans write to describe their “upset and anger”. Community members initially raised concerns over the name in 2019, but efforts to rename the school faced opposition from alumni and residents concerned over the loss of a historical connection. Andrew is facing a possible lawsuit in the United States amid accusations he assaulted Virginia Giuffre when she was a teenager. She alleges she was trafficked by the Duke’s friend, Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender, and was compelled to have sex with Andrew when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly denied both the allegations and ever meeting Giuffre, despite a photograph of the two together. Last week the Queen stripped her second son of his honorary military affiliations, leaving three Canadian regiments without a royal patron. His official Twitter account, TheDukeOfYork, no longer exists and his YouTube account is no longer accessible. The Canadian high school’s decision to sever any association with Andrew comes more than two years after the SickKids Foundation in Toronto, the country’s largest children’s hospital, terminated Prince Andrew’s role as patron. Ontario’s Lakefield College school, which Andrew attended for a brief stint in his youth, ended the Duke’s term as honorary chairman of the school’s foundation board. The school has formed a six-person committee, comprising students, staff and community members as it begins the search for a new name. A local paper suggested Black civil rights leaders, trailblazing politicians, a slain police officer or the Indigenous name for the region as possible contenders for the rebranded school.",News/UK news,Canada’s Prince Andrew high school announces plan to change name,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/20/canada-prince-andrew-high-school-changes-name
1/21/2022,"Catching up with old friends this week and talk turned to a party we had between 2020 lockdowns. In the rented beach house there was dancing on tables, jugs of cocktails, late-night swims and lots of singing. “How about you?” said my friend Oli, turning and pointing at me. “How about your form?” There was an accusatory edge to her voice.  I tried to remember what I had done – something disgraceful? Did I break something while dancing? Say something off? Throw up in the shower? “You went to bed early on the first night and then texted us from upstairs telling us to turn the music down!” The others corroborated this. Someone even put on a baby voice: “Turn it down, turn it down – I’m trying to sleep.” “I was tired,” I said defensively. “It was a Friday and I’d had a long week.” “It was 9:30pm!” said my friends. “You were pissy.” “You sent a text,” said Oli. “You didn’t even tell us to shut up, you texted us!” The next night I had dinner with my friend Jo and her dad. After dinner the tennis was on, a postprandial G&T was offered, there was a bowl of Haigh’s chocolate aniseed rings on the table and I was given the good chair – one that reclined and felt like lying in a giant baseball mitt. The household settled in for a night of tennis, but I couldn’t relax. It was only 7.30pm and still high light outside – but I wanted to go to bed. The chair was like a bed … but still, it wasn’t the same. I waited until 7:45pm before announcing that it was time to go back to my motel. “So you can go to sleep?” asked Jo. “It’s not even dark yet.” On Jo’s 40th, she rented a house in Port Fairy and we had a big party. I snuck off – I’m not sure what time – and found a bunk bed in a dark corner of the house and tried to sleep. A few hours later I was discovered by some of the guests – outraged that I would go to sleep in the middle of a party. They turned on all the lights and grabbed each end of the bedding, picking me up like I was a possum in a hammock and swinging me round in the sheet for a terrifying 15 minutes. After I untwisted myself, I went back to the party and danced wearily until it was safe to slink back to bed unnoticed. But I was beginning to make a name for myself. This Christmas night, I told my brother that after dinner we should watch something on Netflix and he just laughed and said: “But isn’t after dinner your bedtime?” Catching up with friends before Christmas, they compared notes on how much I slept when I came to stay. One lot of friends had a particularly comfortable foldout couch that they kept in their kitchen/lounge. It was the only other room in their place beside their bedroom – and so when I stayed and wanted to go to sleep early, it meant they also had to go to bed. Sometimes, they found it to be painfully early – sent to their rooms before 8pm because their guest was tired. There is something shameful in this – not the going to bed early part, but the forcing others to go to bed early too, in their own house. I had become a tyrant guest – demanding that not only I sleep nursery hours, but that everybody sleeps. In 2012, I wrote an essay for a magazine about being a hedonist. I was living in New York at the time and went out a lot. But my favourite thing to do was go to a dance party each Sunday in Brooklyn called Mister Sunday. It was fun – there were DJs, a dancefloor set up in a disused lot near Gowanus Canal, coloured lights strung across the trees and pop-up bars selling cocktails and $1 Pabst Blue Ribbons. Now it strikes me that going to Mister Sunday each week and partying during the day didn’t make me a hedonist. It made me someone who wanted to be home by 9pm so she could go to sleep. Kurt Vonnegut said, “We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.” I was pretending to be a hedonist – but perhaps it was time to confront the fact that I was actually the opposite and had been for some time. In my head I was the last to go to bed. I knew all the places with the late licences, was active between the hours of 3am and 5am, and photographed dawns on the way home – not on a morning run. But just as people keep a wardrobe full of clothes that no longer fit, that they haven’t worn since their 20s, we keep an idea of ourselves that is from the past. Everyone else can see you’ve changed but you think you’ve stayed the same. Maybe this takes the form of thinking you are progressive, even radical, politically – but then find yourself agreeing with editorials in the Australian, or arguing with your friends about the need for personal responsibility or judging people who receive Centrelink. Or maybe you think you’re the type of person who knows all the good bands before they become mainstream but then listen to the Hottest 100 and don’t recognise a single song. Or maybe you thought you were a night owl, but in actual fact you are a sloth. After being mocked this week for going to bed early, I could no longer ignore the mounting evidence that I was not who I pretended to be.

1/21/2022,"There have been so many remakes and reimaginings of franchises in recent years that I have found myself genuinely fearful my dying words will be “no more reboots” instead of “tell my houseplant I’m sorry”. Generally, I’m of the view that money could be better spent investing in new stories than either using existing characters for seemingly no reason (Riverdale) or retelling the same story from a “gritty” lens (Bel-Air). So I was very surprised by how much I loved the new Saved by the Bell.  I grew up watching reruns of the original series (1989-1992), which followed the escapades of a group of teenagers attending high school in California. The show introduced me to neon bike shorts, practical jokes and added “bodacious babe” to my vocabulary, an odd phrase for a seven-year-old girl to include in a school report. The reboot follows a new group of young people. All the main actors (aside from the late Dustin Diamond) from the original series appear as adult versions of their characters, three in main roles: AC Slater (Mario Lopez) is now a gym teacher, Jessie Spano (Elizabeth Berkley Lauren) is a guidance counsellor and Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) is city mayor. I’ll admit to a mild nostalgic glee at seeing those faces again – but it’s not nostalgia that makes this show great. It’s still a comedy, with the occasional earnest message. This time, though, satire reigns supreme. The former school prankster has become mayor, full of hot air and completely lacking in self-awareness. He’s the butt of the joke now. The reboot story begins with a public school having their funding slashed, and having to merge with the privileged kids and families of Bayside High. We follow new students Daisy, Aisha and Devante, who meet Bayside kids Lexi, Mac (Zack’s son), and Jamie (Jessie’s son). It doesn’t seem entirely fair that when a series employs satire or simply depicts diversity of any kind, it becomes criticised for trying to be “woke”. Having binged both seasons back-to-back recently, my takeaway feeling is one of pure joy at silly jokes, whether these are derived from irony or absurdity. Also, nothing sucks joy out of comedy like analysing it. The narrative works because at its heart the show makes you laugh. They’ve turned the comedy up to 100. They’ve taken the baton and sprinted. This isn’t surprising as the reboot’s showrunner is Tracey Wigfield, who has written for shows like 30 Rock and is a former member of Chicago’s famous improv group Upright Citizens Brigade. While maintaining a narrative structure, the comedy is quick, constant and, in season two in particular, goofy and surreal. (Zack and Mac’s “cool guy” musical montage set to a very obvious green-screen is a highlight.) The reboot depicts social issues in a way that feels authentic and in line with the show’s tone. Where the original series had sudden gear shifts into earnest “after school special”-esque lectures (for example, Jessie becoming addicted to caffeine pills), the new writers weave realistic experiences into episodes that don’t feel clunky or tokenistic. Devante, for example, can’t afford a car like some of his new peers, so takes a three-hour long bus journey to his girlfriend’s house. Comedian and writer Alistair Baldwin tweeted his praise for the show, also noting it has a trans lead actor and quoting a line from the script: “Queer and trans joy are a form of resistance.” I would have loved to have seen this show as a young person, both closeted in my sexuality and love for comedy. Eighteen-year-old Josie Totah is a standout playing Lexi, giving me a huge laugh when she complains about the discomfort of wearing a bra, followed by: “Just kidding! What am I, a 30-year-old loser?” The show also manages to mention the pandemic in a way that I wish other shows did (if they simply must address it at all): very briefly, in context, and as a springboard for humour. A group Zoom call shows Mac attending Kim Kardashian’s 40th birthday party during lockdown, with his classmates asking, “aren’t you scared?!”. He replies, “Yes, 40 is very old for a woman, but I do not fear her.” This show is not pretending to be a gritty drama or Degrassi; sometimes we need a silly laugh without much afterthought. Maybe it’s because I’m closer in age to the original cast but John Michael Higgins as Principal Toddman is in fine form every episode. Sometimes you just want to see a principal dangling from a flagpole lamenting, “My doctor says if I get one more wedgie, I’ll die!” Stream both seasons of the new Saved by the Bell on Stan.",Arts/Culture,Saved by the Bell: surprisingly joyous reboot has belly laughs and a satirical twist,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/21/saved-by-the-bell-surprisingly-joyous-reboot-has-belly-laughs-and-a-satirical-twist
1/21/2022,"Muster Dogs begins as all TV shows should – with a basketful of wriggling, squirming, squeaking newborn puppies. This particular litter of kelpies has been bred by Joe Spicer, a champion breeder whose dogs are in high demand across the country – a testament to his skill, at a time when the traditional Australian working dog doesn’t occupy the place it once did. Hence Muster Dogs, the ABC’s new reality miniseries where five stock handlers around the country attempt to turn Spicer’s pups into fully-fledged working dogs in just 12 months. The five farmers – West Pilbara cattle station owner Aticia Grey, Victorian tree-changer Rob Tuncks, Top End cattle musterer Joni Hall, Northern Territory horse trainer CJ Scotney and third-generation Queensland farmer Frank Finger – put the puppies through a series of trials and challenges designed to assess their progress as they work towards full working-dog status one year later.  When we meet Finger in Muster Dogs, he’s bonding with his pup, Annie, by holding her in front of his face and letting her lick his nose. Besides running his property – west of Clermont in central Queensland – Finger has decades of experience raising and training working dogs. He started a dog training school in 1995, which his sons and daughters now run. “The bonding with your pup is the key to success,” he tells Guardian Australia. “Right from when I got her, she came everywhere with me. She sat in the passenger seat and if we saw cattle, I would just say ‘look!’ or ‘looky-look!’ to familiarise her with them. So now when she sees them, she knows what to do. It’s all about bonding and giving them a pat so they learn what to do and what not to do. It’s very much the same as raising a family.” In recent decades, the image of the farmer or stockman with working dogs at their side has begun to fade as quad bikes, dirtbikes, old utes and even helicopters have taken the role that dogs once filled. Training a working dog typically takes up to three years, which is one reason many farmers now prefer vehicles for mustering; sinking so much time into training a dog that may get injured or turn out to be unsuited to the work is an investment many farmers just can’t afford. And as farming practices change, the knowledge required to breed working dogs is in danger of being lost with each generation. But a good working dog is a valuable thing. Dogs can go many places wheeled vehicles can’t, and aren’t as hard on the land. Unlike noisy quad bikes and deafening helicopters, dogs can also keep cows and sheep calm; as Finger says: “Dogs take the rattle out of the cattle.” While the pups are the real drawcard, the best moments in Muster Dogs involve their human trainers. Each farmer needs very different things from their dogs, and are paired with their pups based on environment and temperament. All face their own unique problems and setbacks, from long-term drought in the Pilbara to the solitude and loneliness on long muster routes in the Territory. Watching their bonds take hold over the four episodes is fascinating. The way the trainers and dogs work together is almost symbiotic. It’s far more subtle than the human just telling the dog what to do and where to go – it’s about harnessing the dog’s bred instincts and intelligence to their best effect. Some of the best scenes in Muster Dogs are drone’s-eye shots of a dog and trainer working a herd. Directed one way and another, the herd moves like water as the dog scoots around and behind it, stopping and starting at a whistle, a word or just a look from the trainer. That kind of cohesiveness, Finger says, takes decades – or longer – to achieve. “It takes a lifetime to learn about dogs, I think. You have to train about 100 pups to really have it down pat,” he says. The opportunity to bond is one of the biggest appeals for the farmers. Besides having an endlessly eager and energetic work assistant, the love and loyalty the dogs give back is enormous. As they grow from chaotic bundles of fur and teeth into thriving working dogs, the kelpies of Muster Dogs effortlessly become media darlings. Expect large and active fan clubs for each of them.

1/21/2022,"It’s 9pm the night before you are due to meet friends for a long-awaited catch-up, and a tentative message appears in the group chat: So, uh, what are we supposed to be wearing now? Two years spent mostly indoors has killed the art of dressing. My style references since March 2020 have been hip teens on TikTok, who lately are looking like they just walked off the set of underrated 2000 teen classic Whatever It Takes, and the five-pack of men’s flannelette shirts I got on sale.  No one knows what we are supposed to wear. What we used to wear, as adults with professional jobs, is both uncomfortable – so many waistbands! Such narrow heels! – and, at this point, not even cool. But before you go out to buy an entirely new wardrobe of elastic-backed slacks in some kind of classic bone to pair with an oversized blazer in an attempt at post-Covid office casual, consider this: don’t. Instead, try dressing in the clothes you really enjoy. This does not have to mean embarking on the introspective and often fraught process to determine your personal style, which can be great fun if you are into clothes and up for being negged about your proportions by a New York style consultant, but can also be quite stressful. What if, after your serious consideration, you discover that your personal style is deeply boring? Best not to risk it. The easiest way to determine what clothes you actually like wearing is to think back to a time when you had the highest level of personal choice over your outfits relative to your awareness of outside opinions. For me, this was about age seven. When I was seven, I wore elastic-sided jodhpur boots with all outfits at all times. I liked stripes. I liked orange and acid green. I did not care whether things were flattering to my body shape because I did not have a shape. Now, at 34, I have four different pairs of elastic-sided boots and am considering getting a fifth. No one has questioned whether this is appropriate. We are living through a traumatic, world-shaping event. We should be able to do so wearing overalls if we wish. Old friends may do a double take when you turn up to brunch dressing confidently like your seven-year-old self. But then they’ll lean forward and ask: “Is that what we’re wearing now?”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Easy wins: no one knows what we’re supposed to wear, so dress like a seven-year-old",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/21/easy-wins-no-one-knows-what-were-supposed-to-wear-so-dress-like-a-seven-year-old
1/21/2022,"A competition to find Australia’s finest drop of water has announced the Richmond valley council water plant in NSW as its winner. The 2021 Best Tasting Tap Water competition, hosted by the Water Industry Operators Association of Australia (WIOA), pitted water authority state winners from metropolitan and regional areas around the country against each other.  Taking home the national title, the Richmond Valley Council Casino Water Treatment Plant will go on to represent Australia at the 32nd annual Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting Competition, held in West Virginia, United States. David Timms, representative of the Richmond valley council plant, said: “I’m a little bit shocked to be honest.” “We were absolutely rapt just to have won the NSW competition, let alone to win the Australian one.” Judged on clarity, smell, taste and “feeling in the mouth”, Craig Mathisen, WIOA chief operations officer, explained each water sample is judged on particular criteria. “We make sure it is translucent, then we smell the sample, because odour is important,” he said. “But ultimately, it is a test of one’s palate.” Judging today’s event, which was livestreamed on Facebook from Risdon Brook dam in Hobart, were TasWater CEO Mike Brewster, Derwent Estuary Program CEO Ursula Taylor, and guest judge George Bailey, who is the national chairman of selectors for the Australian Men’s International Cricket Team. “It is like tasting wines,” Taylor said. Bailey shared that he could not pick much difference between the six samples’ clarity or colour, suspecting the glasses were too clean. Brewster added that the difference between taste is also “very fine”. The judges’ rankings of each sample were then aggregated, and the winner announced. Mathisen explained that different treatment processes and sources of water can vary taste, “and some facilities have unique processes”. Victoria’s Rossarden water, international winner of 2020, for example, comes from a “stream off the back of a mountain environment”. In Marian, Queensland, a newer site established in 2014 uses “clarification filtration and chlorine disinfection”. Their water won silver at the 2019 international competition. On the other side of the country, Western Australia water facilities include a “cocktail mix” of sources and technologies, including “groundwater and desalination”. And in South Australia, water from the Murray River “gets pushed” across the state, and “will sometimes travel 600km before getting to its destination”. “There’s a whole range of different processes,” Mathisen said. “We are the driest country, with some of the greatest water, but a lot of people don’t give the water industry much thought.” The national competition “is about raising awareness of the industry, and the work people do, that often goes unnoticed,” he said. The line up of state finalists included SA Water’s Anstey Hill Water Treatment Plant; WA Water Corporation’s Wyndham Water Treatment Plant; Westernport Water’s Ian Bartlett Water Purification Plant in Victoria; Tasmania’s TasWater Rocky Creek Water Treatment Plant and Queensland’s Mackay regional council Marian Water Treatment Plant. Timms, of the winning Richmond valley council plant, said that the crew “out at the water treatment plants [have had] a lot of challenges over the last two years. But we’ve got a great bunch out there who have persevered.” Mathisen said workers in the industry are “working in public health, removing contaminants, making sure we have safe drinking water, ensuring sewage is distributed back to the environment in a kind way”. “Australia is a hard country,” he said. “They’re doing their job all of the time. Battling through floods and fires and the millennium drought.” “And at the end of the day, we turn on the tap and expect water to be there.”",News/Environment,Top drop: NSW’s Richmond valley takes out best tap water in Australia title,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/21/top-drop-nsws-richmond-valley-takes-out-best-tap-water-in-australia-title
1/21/2022,"Skilled migrants and graduates still trapped by border restrictions for bridging visa holders have condemned their “brutally unfair” treatment by the Australian government, saying it will drive away workers at a time of dire labour shortages. The federal government has announced eased travel restrictions for the vast majority of temporary visa holders, allowing them to leave and enter Australia after being trapped amid the pandemic.  But travel restrictions remain for those who hold bridging visa B (BVB), which usually allows holders to live in Australia and travel abroad while they await government decisions on more permanent visas. BVB holders have found themselves stuck in Australia due to a combination of blowouts in visa processing times and the border restrictions, which make it near impossible for them to enter the country or to re-enter after leaving. That has left many, including skilled migrants waiting for permanent residency, in despair. Unable to see their families for years, and with no end in sight, many are considering leaving Australia permanently. Muhammad, who was raised in the United Arab Emirates, was invited to Australia on the promise of a regional work visa as an engineer in the construction sector. But he has been unable to leave Australia since the pandemic began, initially because he was on a temporary visa, and now because he is on a bridging visa, still awaiting the government’s final decision on his status. Muhammad has not seen his family for three-and-a-half years, and was meant to get married abroad this year, but has been separated from his fiancee by the border restrictions. His skills are crucial to a booming sector already short of skilled workers. But Muhammad said his mental health was seriously suffering and he was considering leaving the country for good. “The very first reason why my parents moved to Australia … is they were moving to a better place for their family,” he said. “But it’s not a better place if you are not even getting your basic rights to see your family.” Morrison announced this week the government was making it easier for working holidaymakers and students to come to Australia, in an effort to relieve workforce shortages caused by the pandemic. No change was announced for bridging visa holders. Morrison’s comments infuriated Emma Cochrane, who has been trapped in Australia since the start of the pandemic. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It made me cry, because I’ve tried every resource to make them aware of our plight,” she said. Cochrane moved with her family from the UK to Perth in August 2018 on a skilled regional visa, which allowed her to apply for permanent residency after living and working in a regional area for two years. But the skilled regional visa expired as the family waited for a decision on their permanent residency – a process that has taken 17 months so far – meaning they had to be placed on a bridging visa. The bridging visa means Cochrane, an education assistant, is still stuck and unable to see her family in the UK. If she were to leave, she would need an exemption to get back in to Australia. Cochrane has applied 14 times for an exemption. Each application was denied. “We’re literally stuck in this limbo-land,” she said. “We can’t risk taking my girls out.” BVB holders have started a petition, which now has 15,000 signatures, calling for the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, to ease restrictions. “We pay our taxes, we provide essential skills, received double vaccinations and contribute to the economy,” the petition says. “It’s discriminatory to stop us from visiting our friends and families while others can.” The independent MP Zali Steggall and Greens senator Nick McKim have both lobbied Hawke to address the issue, but to no avail. McKim told Hawke in a letter that the restrictions for bridging visa holders were causing “immeasurable pain to thousands of people”. “With global visa processing times blowing out significantly across a number of visa classes due to Covid-19, people that are offshore on both expired and valid BVBs are still not able to return to Australia while their substantive visas are being processed,” he said. “This group of visa holders have been waiting for more than 20 months for clarity around their future in Australia.” Another bridging visa holder, who asked not to be named, is stuck in Nepal, desperate to come back to Australia to work. She graduated and had applied for a recent graduate visa, before being put on a bridging visa. She described the restrictions as “brutally unfair”. “I have lived in Adelaide for four years, completed my degree and got a professional job for myself,” she said. “This is hindering my professional growth and the career plans I have set for myself. “Amid all this, it is funny to see government luring student and working holiday visa holders to come and fill the gap of workforce.” Hawke’s office was approached for comment.",News/Australia news,"‘Stuck in limbo-land’: restrictions keep bridging visa holders trapped in, and out, of Australia",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/21/stuck-in-limbo-land-restrictions-keep-bridging-visa-holders-trapped-in-and-out-of-australia
1/21/2022,"The Omicron outbreak of Covid cases appears to have peaked in New South Wales, Victoria and other parts of Australia, epidemiologists believe. Prof Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at the University of South Australia, said the Omicron wave had “absolutely certainly” peaked in NSW and Victoria.  The Reff – the effective reproduction number, which measures how many other people someone with Covid will infect, on average – had dropped below 1 in both states, Esterman said. “We know that the peak has been reached when the Reff gets below 1.” On Thursday, Esterman calculated the Reff to be 0.83 in NSW and 0.8 in Victoria. “You can’t really interpret the daily cases very well because of huge fluctuations and large of numbers of rapid antigen tests coming through on a given day but being distributed over previous days,” Esterman said. “The Reff is still reasonably stable despite the daily fluctuation in case numbers.” Victoria’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said on Monday he believed the state’s case numbers were close to peaking, but expected the number of people in hospital would continue to increase. The number of people in hospital with Covid in NSW dropped on Thursday to 2,781, the first time the figure has fallen in the state since 18 December. The state’s health authorities had previously predicted that hospitalisation figures – which typically lag reported case numbers by seven to 14 days – would begin to plateau this week. “I would expect to see hospitalisations starting to come down now,” Esterman said. Other experts were more cautious. Dr Michael Lydeamore, an infectious disease modeller at Monash University, said NSW was “probably through the worst” and that Victorian cases looked to be “levelling off”, but that it would take another week before experts could be certain both states had reached a peak. “NSW looks more like it’s peaked than Victoria, but in both states we’re still not really sure how many infections we’re detecting. It’s that separation between infections going on and cases, which is what’s reported,” he said. Prof Alexandra Martiniuk, an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney agreed that while cases seemed to be dropping in NSW, “the lack of good data is making this hard”. Despite the welcome inclusion of positive RATs in official case figures, “we don’t have an accurate sense of the number of cases in the community”, she said. Experts agree that population-wide surveys are needed to accurately estimate levels of Covid infection in Australia. Esterman said Covid spread was showing “a very similar pattern across all states and territories” except Western Australia, “likely peaking at the moment and almost certainly going to be coming down shortly”. Lydeamore anticipated a “bumpy road” ahead for the Northern Territory over the next few weeks, due to lower vaccination rates in some regions, high rates of pre-existing health conditions, and challenges posed by geographical remoteness. “That’s going to make it very tough,” he said. Though Omicron cases have risen steeply, experts said the decrease in cases was likely to occur more slowly. “We could be having high cases for a while as it drops slowly down, and it could also plateau at a level that is not necessarily low,” Martiniuk said. Other countries, such as Canada, experienced a slight uptick in Covid cases when students returned to school, she said. Esterman anticipated a “slow decline in case numbers with an occasional blip upwards when things happen, like schools reopening”. Lydeamore said while school-related outbreaks and infections among teaching staff were likely, the return to school was “probably not going to massively blow up the cases again”. Martiniuk emphasised the importance of getting boosters, wearing masks and outdoor socialising “while we’re dropping down the curve”. “Sadly, this isn’t the end of Covid, probably.”",News/World news,"Australia’s Omicron wave has likely peaked in NSW and Victoria, some experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/australias-omicron-wave-has-likely-peaked-in-nsw-and-victoria-some-experts-say
1/21/2022,"After many years I have finally got my “dream” job – it’s perfect for me, the work is meaningful and genuinely interesting. However, a new problem has reared its head that I was not expecting – while I love my job, I resent having to work at all. I have become irrationally angry at the amount of time work takes up, that its schedule dictates most of my days, decisions on where I can live, that I have to request days off. What I do is important to me, but I cannot fathom that this is what my life will be for maybe the next 40 years – wearing dress code-appropriate clothing, wolfing down sandwiches in my 30-minute lunch break, then puttering back to my home to get a good eight hours so I can do it all again. The dream job did not exactly come with a dream salary, so shorter hours are out of the question, and I honestly don’t think that would solve the underlying issue. While I wait for automation to take away the need for humans to work at all, any advice?  First, let me warn you that many people who hear this may bristle and start telling you about the noble value of a job. “It’s character building; you should be grateful you even have one.” Don’t listen. While it’s true that some people find meaning in their career or use it to forge an identity they’re proud of, the fact that’s true for them doesn’t mean it should be for you. You’re not deviant for feeling this way – I’ve said elsewhere that the idea that work has moral value unto itself is a myth we pay for with the one resource we can never replenish: our time. But that doesn’t soften the brute reality that we have to get money somehow. I think a lot of the resentment we can feel at work comes from knowing quite how brute that reality is: it’s not just that the tasks grate, whether we’re sending emails or stacking shelves. It’s the feeling that there’s no choice about it. That can make us feel hollowed of agency, conveyor-belted into a life we don’t recognise – you capture it when you talk about wolfing meals, dressing for others, constantly needing permission. No one likes to feel they’re not the author of their own life. The task in front of you, I think, is to restore a sense of agency. Start with the parts of life that aren’t work. It’s perilously easy to commute home, mush-brained and worn through, and collapse into screens until bedtime. Try very hard not to do that. Find whatever it is that restores your energy and identity after work and insist on doing it. Cycle home; dance to loud music when you get there; join a community group that will expect you at a certain time; put cold pickles on your eyes if you need to – anything that will wash the work torpor off you so can insist your leisure time will be spent on your joys and projects, not just the absence of work. The more you can populate life with things you recognise as yours, the less it will feel like work is swallowing you whole. Then think about work itself. What can you do that will make your relationship to your job feel more deliberate, more inhabited? Is it being a workplace organiser for something you care about; resolving you don’t answer emails after a certain time? Is it making a passion project of the history of work, so time spent at work feels like field notes rather than drudgery? You could even sit down and work out exactly how much money you need to live the life you want, and ask whether this job is the best way to make that money. You can answer either way, as long as you answer – as long as it feels like a decision. You aren’t alone in feeling this way. But the world does constrain our choices – every day we have to make decisions about what we’ll sacrifice in exchange for something else. The key to not letting that fact erode you is being able to recognise yourself in what is decided. Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

1/21/2022,"Millions of Australians could be left empty-handed when the government’s free rapid test scheme launches on Monday, with pharmacies citing severe supply and cost pressures. More than 90% of pharmacies could be forced to limit the kits as wholesale prices soar above the slated government rebate, according to industry insiders.  The joint federal and state government Rapid Antigen Testing Concessional Access Program will see millions of pensioners, veterans and low income earners become eligible for up to 10 free tests between now and April. Pharmacies will be reimbursed $10 for each kit under the plan rubber-stamped at national cabinet last week. But increased demand has seen wholesale prices jump above the rebate, meaning retailers would be out of pocket and forced to sell the tests at market value. Matt Feros, a Sydney pharmacist, supported the scheme but was concerned about how quickly he will be reimbursed, or if and when the stock he has ordered will arrive. “We have to place orders which may take two weeks or longer for delivery, paying upfront cash that we might not get reimbursed for up to a month or more,” he said. “We have to take a big risk that we might be stuck with large amounts of stock or have bought stock that is higher price than what we would otherwise get paid for. “It leaves us in a situation where we’re looking to take lesser risk, which may not leave us with the ability to meet initial demands.” The pharmacist believed many businesses would only be able to “participate in a limited capacity” initially, unable to source sufficient stock under $10 per unit. The president of the NSW branch of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, David Heffernan, predicted about nine in 10 pharmacies will have insufficient stock come Monday. “Pharmacists feel like we’ve got a gun to our heads at the moment because we’ve got to help the public,” Heffernan said, “and we want to, but it’s becoming impossible because the market is so volatile.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Six weeks ago smaller retailers were able to order tests at about $8 a unit, he explained. “But what’s happening now is that because of the demand on supply a lot of wholesalers are asking you to pay upfront, and to get a good price you have to order a huge quantity which, if you’re a small pharmacy … you just don’t have that kind of money available,” Heffernan said. While prime minister Scott Morrison ruled out making rapid tests universally free because of the potential disruption to supply chains, Heffernan said the price issue was being exacerbated by the test shortage and increasing demand from government and private purchasers. Some pharmacy owners are being forced to place very large orders in a bid to push the unit price below the rebate. Morrison on Thursday labelled reports the commonwealth was requisitioning supplies of the tests as “false”. “You may be aware of some false claims regarding commonwealth government requisitioning of rapid antigen tests,” he said. “These are false claims.” He also denied the government’s procurement efforts were distorting the market. “We’re not redirecting supplies to commonwealth orders and we have not put in place any arrangements to do that,” the prime minister said. Multiple sources from within the pharmacy industry said prices had risen since a flurry of purchases from governments eager to secure their own supplies. “There is a lot of supply in Australia right now, but none of it is ending up with the pharmacists,” Heffernan said. The cost of the tests compared to the rebate will mean some pharmacists opt out of the system, according to the NSW branch president of the Pharmaceutical Society Chelsea Felkai, a Newcastle-based pharmacist. “You would be lucky to get an order for under $10 per test,” she said. “The reality is most pharmacists won’t even break even. “It’s 100% going to discourage pharmacists from being involved.” Earlier this week, Feros started a waiting list for his most vulnerable customers to register for the first round of subsidised rapid tests. Despite the administrative burden, he said it was important to get the tests to those who needed them. Concession holders will have access to up to five tests a month, capped at 10 tests overall across a three month period. Anthony Piggott, who runs a chain of pharmacies in Newcastle, expected price pressures to ease over the life of the concessional scheme but significant issues remain in accessing the tests. “If someone offered me a shipment at $12 per test, I wouldn’t offer them to concessional patients,” he said. “You just can’t offer the service at a loss. “But the market should hopefully correct and I think that will happen over time.” Existing backlogs on orders mean there was “no chance” the pharmacists would be able to offer the tests at a concessional discount come Monday, he said. “I was expecting a delivery of thousands last week but the orders are just getting held up,” he said. “It seems like the government announced what they were doing first and are dealing with the details after.” Federal health minister, Greg Hunt, on Thursday conceded availability of tests was not guaranteed. “It will depend on the individual supply that is available in any particular outlet or pharmacy,” he said.",News/Australia news,"‘No chance’: initial availability of concessional rapid tests in doubt, say Australian pharmacists",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/21/no-chance-initial-availability-of-concessional-rapid-tests-in-doubt-say-australian-pharmacists
1/21/2022,"“I never realised how famous a simple bacon sandwich could be,” says Gavan Knox, a self-described foodie who moved to Toronto from London in 2016. “The bakery I get them from has pictures on the wall of celebrities trying them out.” Speaking from his home in Scarborough, a community on the eastern edge of Toronto, you can hear Gavan’s love for Carousel Bakery’s carnivorous snack radiating through the screen. The sandwich is scrumptious in its simplicity. “It’s a bread roll with several slices of perfect peameal bacon, and a fried egg if you like. It’s absolutely irresistible,” he says.  Run by brothers Maurice and Robert Biancolin, Carousel Bakery is an institution at Toronto’s St Lawrence Market, and its bacon, like any sought-after treat worth its salt, is made by a “secret producer”. Peameal bacon, by the way, is an Ontario speciality and owes its name to the ground dried peas that it used to be rolled in before producers switched to cornmeal. Carousel Bakery in St Lawrence Market is renowned for its bacon buns For Gavan and his partner Scott Knox, there isn’t a much better way to spend a morning than at St Lawrence Market. “Seeing the butchers, fishmongers and bakers at work, it’s just got this ambience that I love,” he enthuses. “There’s an awesome cheese store there too, Olympic Cheese, which is said to have 800 kinds of cheese. Scott loves it, so I can leave him there and do a circuit of the market. Guaranteed he’ll have a few bags full by the time I get back.” The market is home to butchers, bakers, cheesemongers and world-food stores As a keen cook and baker, Gavan knows the market is a place where he can track down hard-to-find items. “There are a couple of world food stores, which I love, because if I’m looking for a certain ingredient to make, say, Thai or Ghanaian food, I can go there and the chances are, I’ll find it.” Scott and Gavan sound like Toronto natives, the way they know the city’s food scene like their own backyard – you’d never think they’d only lived there for a few years. The pair met in 2003 in Manchester and moved in together in London a few months later. But in 2016, Canada came knocking. They had taken a holiday to Toronto in 2015 and Scott, who at the time was managing director of the Marketing Agencies Association in the UK, had lunch with the president of the Institute of Communication Agencies (ICA), an association that represents Canadian advertising, marketing, media and public relations agencies. “A year later, she called me and said: ‘I’m retiring, have you ever thought about moving to Canada?’ So we took the decision to go – and now I’m president and CEO of the ICA. We gave ourselves two years, and said that if we didn’t like it, we’d return to the UK. Five years later, we’ve bought the house we now live in, and love it here.” For Gavan, the move was made easier by the fact he felt right at home among the foodie crowd in Ontario’s capital. He had made a name for himself in the UK through his baking business, Mr Mom’s Kitchen, gaining further recognition, and making a TV appearance, after winning an award for one of his recipes through Observer Food Monthly. He soon found foodie friends aplenty in his new home town. “On occasion it’s been a little disconcerting,” laughs Scott. “We’d go into a restaurant and the owner or the chef comes out and starts talking to Gavan. And I’m thinking, how do you know each other!” Japanese restaurant Akira Back is a firm favourite of the couple On the whole, the couple find the restaurant scene in the city friendly and “democratic”, whereas in London, they feel, high-end places can tend to verge on the elitist. They rave about Akira Back, a luxury Japanese restaurant in the Bisha Hotel, where the eponymous chef creates modern Japanese dishes with Korean flavours. “The food is just outstanding,” says Scott. “They do this thing called a mushroom and salmon pizza, which is one of their starter dishes. Honestly, it is just heavenly.” The couple have no end of places to recommend for anyone new to the city. Si Lom Thai is a favourite, located on Church St in the gay village. “It’s the best Thai we’ve had in Toronto,” says Gavan, adding that they like it also because it’s so family friendly. The couple have two adopted children, age 13 and 14. “One of the things that I love about Si Lom is that it’s fully authentic. They even come up with these crazy delicious Thai cocktails.” Si Lom Thai is a family favourite And, of course, no visit to Canada is complete without brunch. “I was astounded by how big brunch is in Canada compared to the UK,” says Gavan, mentioning Smith, a French restaurant, also in the village, as their ultimate, top choice for a mid-morning stop. “If you’re in Toronto, it’s a great go-to for brunch,” he says, although due to Covid-19, it’s now only open on the weekend. Diners can tuck into classic dishes such as eggs benedict, croque madame and the Smith ruben, that’s corned beef, sauerkraut and pickles on rye, but Gavan’s particular favourite is chicken and waffles served with greens and a bourbon chilli syrup. Brunch is a Canadian staple at Smith (top) and Butchie’s (below) If you’re looking to get out of town (and are a fried chicken lover like Gavan), the pair suggest heading to Butchie’s, located on Dundas Street West in Whitby. It’s about an hour’s drive from downtown Toronto, and Gavan and Scott say it’s well worth a pit stop for its smoked meats and fried chicken. Alongside the pub-style fare, its atmosphere is part of the appeal. “You walk in and the staff are really friendly. Even now with Covid protocols and precautions, they still have time to have a conversation with you,” says Gavan. Friendliness seems to be a theme running through the couple’s experience of the Ontario food scene, as well as the quality of the dishes served up. And it’s not just at restaurants that this friendly vibe comes through. Scott occasionally attends business functions through his work, and notes that even within the catering industry, a can-do attitude and welcoming spirit shines through. One of his favourite places for corporate events is the Westin Trillium at Blue Mountain, a luxury hotel nestled on Georgian Bay, two hours northwest of Toronto. “There’s nothing too difficult to get done there,” he says, even for events of 150-200 people. If you are there in winter, whether for work or pleasure, the hotel’s O&B cafe offers superb dining in a relaxed atmosphere where skiers can come in off the slopes and eat in their gear before heading out again, suitably replenished. Tuck in to the wonderfully named chicken and leek potstickers (dumplings) or a bee sting pizza with a side of grilled cornbread and maple butter. If you feel like venturing farther afield, Blue Mountain resort is home to small town cafes and restaurants offering a warm welcome, steaming mugs of hot chocolate and cakes that you won’t be able to resist, especially after a day outdoors The Westin Trillium at Blue Mountain Gavan and Scott value the friendly welcomes wherever they go, and the multiculturalism that is ever present too: “I love the fact that Canada’s food scene embraces many cultures, making them as accessible as possible,” says Gavan, adding that it’s on his bucket list to try more restaurants that specialise in First Nations food. Drinks-wise, he highlights Red Tape Brewery, and its beers influenced by Inuit culture. He says that the Paunnat Saison beer is brewed with paunnat flowers that are native to Nunavut, Canada’s northernmost territory, and home mainly to Inuit people. Red Tape Brewery’s beers are influenced by Inuit culture Whether it’s rhapsodising over the perfect Japanese starter or explaining the uncomplicated satisfaction of four slices of bacon in a roll, chatting to Gavan and Scott Knox is enough to make anyone feel peckish. And it’s clear there is something for every budget in Toronto and the surrounding areas, be it authentic Thai food, pub-style grub, or a classic brunch, Canadian-style.
