A group of archaeologists has found evidence of the largest megaquake in human history. A new study featured in Science Advances says that the newly discovered Chile megaquake took place around 3,800 years ago. The quake was so terrible that it led to the abandonment of nearby coastlines for almost 1,000 years.

It took place in what is now northern Chile. The Chile megaquake did more than just shake the land in the area, though. It also created a massive tsunami with waves as high as 20 meters (66 feet). Researchers believe the tsunami caused by the Chile megaquake traveled all the way to New Zealand. That’s almost 6,000 miles from the point of origin. The tsunami waves were so powerful, they flung coastal boulders the size of cars hundreds of miles inland. This newly discovered earthquake beats the previous record for the largest earthquake recorded. The Valdivia earthquake took place in 1960. At the time, records picked up a massive quake in southern Chile that had a magnitude between 9.4 and 9.6. The Valdivia earthquake killed up to 6,000 people and sent tsunamis out across the Pacific Ocean. For comparison, researchers believe the new Chile megaquake hit with a magnitude of 9.5. The rupture it created was roughly 620 miles long, compared to the 500 miles long rupture made by the Valdivia earthquake. James Goff, a co-author of the new study, and a geologist at the University of Southampton in England says nobody believed an earthquake this size was possible in the northern part of the country. Now, though, Goff says they have evidence that the Chile megaquake took place thousands of years ago. “The Atacama Desert is one of the driest, most hostile environments in the world and finding evidence of tsunamis there has always been difficult,” Goff explains in a statement. “However, we found evidence of marine sediments and a lot of beasties that would have been living quietly in the sea before being thrown inland. And we found all these very high up and a long way inland so it could not have been a storm that put them there.” Coincidentally, just before joining the study, Goff was in New Zealand, on Chatham Island. There, he was studying a vast number of large boulders that appeared to have been thrown hundreds of miles inland. Goff says they determined a Chile megaquake with at least a 9.5 magnitude had moved the boulders. But they had no proof. With these new findings, the researchers have found proof that this mega earthquake did in fact exist. While the Chile megaquake drove the inhabitants away from the coast when it hit over 3,000 years ago, the islands it affected in the South Pacific were uninhabited at that time. Now the islands are popular tourist locations. And a lot of people congregate there. That means that any tsunamis or earthquakes that hit the area could be catastrophic. As such, Goff says he hopes they can learn more from these findings in case something like this ever happens again. Click here to read the full article.

4/22/2022,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The work of an investigator looking into the 2020 presidential election in Wisconsin generated fresh criticism Thursday after newly posted documents included a memo describing one elections worker as “probably” a Democrat in part because she loves nature and “has a weird nose ring.” Also on Thursday, a judge ordered Michael Gableman to stop deleting records, the latest legal defeat for the former state Supreme Court justice. Gableman has released two interim reports on the election won by President Joe Biden and has suggested the GOP-controlled Legislature look into decertifying his victory. Republican leaders including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who hired Gableman, have repeatedly said they have no intention of trying to decertify the win. Gableman's reports have not included evidence to back up the false claims that Donald Trump won Wisconsin in 2020. A recently posted unsigned document on Gableman's website, titled “cross pollinators,” details his probe into public employees who work in elections. That memo contends that a geographic information system analyst for Milwaukee is “probably” a Democrat because she plays video games, “has a weird nose ring,” sometimes colors her hair, “loves nature and snakes” and lives with a boyfriend but is not married to him. Other documents posted on Gableman’s website misspell the name of Vos, who hired him, as “Voss.” The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first reported on the documents. “It is bizarre,” state Sen. Kathy Bernier, a Republican who leads the Senate Elections Committee, said of the memo. “It is speculative. It is stereotypical. It’s not something I would expect out of a conservative’s position.” Bernier, who has long been critical of Gableman’s investigation, said he is on a “partisan crusade and he’s harming Republicans in the process.” “There’s something wrong with him,” she said. Gableman did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Biden’s win over Trump by nearly 21,000 votes has withstood recounts, independent audits and reviews and numerous lawsuits. Still, Vos ordered the review by Gableman last summer under pressure from Trump and others who falsely contend the election was stolen. Gableman's work is mired in lawsuits, including three brought by the liberal watchdog group American Oversight. It filed numerous open records requests seeking documents primarily from Vos and Gableman. Vos has been found in contempt  in one case for failing to turn over records. Dane County Circuit Judge Frank Remington on Thursday issued an order in another of those lawsuits, telling Gableman “not to delete or destroy any record that is or may be responsive” to the group's open records requests. Remington made the order after Gableman's attorney told American Oversight that it “routinely deletes documents and text messages that are not of use to the investigation.” The nonpartisan Legislative Council, attorneys who advise the Legislature, said in October that deleting such records, even by a state contractor like Gableman, is a violation of Wisconsin law. Gableman's attorney, James Bopp, has argued in court filings that the record retention law does not pertain to contractors. Bopp did not immediately return a message seeking comment Thursday. Bopp said in the April 8 letter to American Oversight that all responsive records have been turned over and once the investigation is complete, all materials will be made public. Bopp said that Gableman's office routinely evaluates documents, including text messages and emails, to determine whether the record is of use to the ongoing probe. Those determined to be relevant are retained and the others are deleted, Bopp said. American Oversight adviser Melanie Sloan faulted Gableman's office for deleting the records. “If this investigation was above board, the Office of Special Counsel would have maintained and released records of its work required by law,"" Sloan said. ""Instead, it is fighting tooth and nail to hide its work from the public. This inquiry is nothing more than an attempt to prop up conspiracy theories and undermine free and fair elections.” Gableman's contract runs through the end of April, but he has indicated in recent interviews that he does not expect it to be extended. Remington in March  released more than 700 pages of documents from Gableman, records the judge said did not support conclusions made in Gableman’s latest report or that showed there has been much of an investigation at all.",U.S./Associated Press,Judge orders Wisconsin investigator to stop deleting records,https://news.yahoo.com/judge-orders-wisconsin-investigator-stop-183717047.html
