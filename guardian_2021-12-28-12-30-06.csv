12/28/2021,"Acclaimed author and poet Keri Hulme, who was the first New Zealander to win the Booker prize, has died aged 74. The reclusive writer, who won the prestigious literary prize in 1985 for her first novel The Bone People, died on Monday at her home in Waimate in New Zealand’s South Island.  Born in Christchurch in 1947 to a mother of Māori and Scottish ancestry and a father of English descent, Hulme was the eldest of six children. The seeds for her writing often came to her in dreams, and explored themes of identity and isolation. The protagonist in The Bone People, a solitary part-Māori artist named Kerewin Holmes, was “a clear stand-in for the author”, wrote Sam Jordison in the Guardian. Described as “a unique example of Māori magical realism”, The Bone People took Hulme 12 years to write, but New Zealand publishers either rejected it outright or demanded major edits. Hulme declared she would rather have the book “embalmed in Perspex” than reworked. In 1984 it was picked up by Spiral, a small feminist press, which gave it an initial print run of 2,000 copies. It has since sold more than a million copies and won the Pegasus prize for literature as well as the Booker. In 1985, Hulme was so unconvinced of her chances of winning the Booker prize she didn’t attend the awards ceremony in London. When she was notified of her win by telephone during the international broadcast, she responded: “You are pulling my leg aren’t you … Bloody hell – it’s totally unbelievable.” The first New Zealander to win the @TheBookerPrizes Keri Hulme won the award in 1985 for 'The Bone People'. I love the bit here during the ceremony when they ring her on the phone to tell her and she says, ""Bloody hell!"" https://t.co/T3Te8pD27a #KeriHulme #TheBonePeople Speaking to New Zealand news website Stuff, Hulme’s nephew Matthew Salmons said his aunt never wanted to be perceived as a “​​literary giant”. “It was never about fame for her, she’s always been a storyteller. It was never about the glitz and glam, she just had stories to share. “She gave us as a family the greatest gift of all, which would be reconnecting us with our Whakapapa Māori and reigniting that passion for our history, our people that had been lost over a couple of generations.” Hulme lived for many years in Ōkārito, a settlement on the West Coast of New Zealand, where she dedicated herself to catching whitebait, painting and writing. She produced collections of poetry, short stories and a novella.",Arts/Culture,"Keri Hulme, New Zealand’s first Booker prize-winning writer, dies aged 74",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/28/keri-hulme-booker-prize-new-zealand-writer-dies-74
12/28/2021,"Ralf Rangnick has been known throughout his career for his directness, without ever being a firebrand type of coach, and the Manchester United interim manager played true to form even if his team fell well short of expectation at St James’ Park. “I didn’t like the performance at all,” he said bluntly after a fortuitous 1-1 draw at Newcastle on Monday night, salvaged by the substitute Edinson Cavani’s second-half equaliser. “We had too many unforced errors when we had the ball.” Rangnick lamented a first-half display in which United teetered on the brink of total ruin, punctuated by Allan Saint-Maximin’s opener.  “It was better in the second half,” he added. “But still not on the sort of level we need to control games.” Fans may have welcomed the arrival of a coach with a discernible philosophy, but there are few hints that anything other than a transitional season is in prospect, with no strides made to match those of Antonio Conte at Tottenham. “We didn’t play as aggressively as we needed to against the ball in terms of counter-pressing,” Rangnick said with an apparent degree of frustration. “It was not a problem of formation, but of energy and of intensity. This is something we need to get better at.” A half-time reshuffle from his 4-2-2-2 earned a point, at least. “We had two wingers [in the second half], and this is how we prepared our equaliser. But we were still too open and allowed them two or three good counter-attack situations, when David de Gea was outstanding again. We won a point – we didn’t lose two.” The German frequently used the word “physicality” to express where United had been lacking, and it is clear in which domain he is hoping for improvement before Burnley’s visit on Thursday. “Burnley will be a physical game,” he said, “and we have to be more physical.” Rangnick’s opposite number Eddie Howe, meanwhile, declared himself “desperately disappointed not to win” after a refreshing performance which continued his charm offensive on the local public. Yet, like Rangnick, the former Bournemouth manager is pressed by time and circumstance, with a trip to Everton on Thursday looming into view, Covid creeping into the squad and injuries to Callum Wilson and goalscorer Saint-Maximin. Wilson, who went down holding his ankle without contact, appears the bigger worry. “It’s too early to move my thought processes in that way,” Howe replied when asked if his No 9’s latest fitness issue would alter his January transfer plans, but he did have another fine performance from the repurposed Joelinton to lift his spirits. “First and foremost he’s given me everything,” enthused Howe. ”He’s bought into what we’re trying to do. He’s delivered a high level of performance based on a high level of understanding. He’s playing with real confidence. Hopefully that can continue and he can contribute even more.” Howe may have to rely on the Brazilian even more than anticipated.",Sport/Football,‘Not a problem of formation’: Rangnick bemoans Manchester United physicality ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/28/not-a-problem-of-formation-rangnick-bemoans-manchester-united-physicality
12/28/2021,"Aboriginal children in Western Australia have been kept in detention after being granted bail because child protection services did not know where to house them, the Aboriginal Legal Service has said. The Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia wrote to the state’s minister for children, Simone McGurk, as well as the attorney general and the Department of Communities this month saying it had “grave concerns” that the department had failed in its duty to find suitable accommodation for children who had been caught up in the criminal justice system.  ALSWA has contacted the department about eight children since June 2019 who had been detained in Banksia Hill youth detention centre despite being granted bail, because suitable accommodation could not be found. In one case, a 14-year-old boy with just one charge on his criminal record was held in detention for three weeks despite being granted bail at his first appearance before the court because the department did not sign his bail undertaking.

If a child is in the care of the state, the state is their guardian and must sign the undertaking. ALSWA’s director of legal services, Peter Collins, said the department’s decision not to sign the bail undertaking was contrary to the state’s obligations under the Children and Community Services Act, which requires the department to “regard the best interest of the child as the paramount consideration”, and also contradicted the principle that detaining a young person in custody must be the option of last resort. “We wish to express our frustration with the repeated failures on the part of the department to meet their obligations to find appropriate placements for young people in its care,” Collins wrote. “The fact that ALSWA lawyers have frequently been pivotal in ensuring young people are secured placements in these instances, and that these placements are often with family members who are already known to the department, beggars belief. “We urge you to act on the above concerns as a matter of priority.” The letter was dated 13 December. As of 24 December, ALSWA had not received a response. A spokesperson from the department told Guardian Australia there could sometimes be a delay between a child being granted bail and being released from custody, to arrange appropriate housing and transport. “There is often an expectation that once a child or young person is granted bail, they are released from custody immediately,” the spokesperson said. “A range of factors, including transport arrangements and care planning, must be coordinated before Communities can safely provide bail for children in care – both for the child or young person and the broader community.” The department said it tried to maintain the child’s previous foster placement, “however, there are occasions where the level of support required may not be available at the point that bail is granted and Communities cannot adequately ensure the safety of the young person or the community”. “The safety and wellbeing of children is always the Department of Communities’ number one priority.” Collins said it was the fourth time the legal service had written to the department about the matter since June 2019 and the department had had “ample opportunity to put procedures in place to provide suitable care for young people with complex needs”. He said many of the children involved had very complex needs, including cognitive and behavioural conditions and mental health considerations, which were best supported by a community-based detention order, not by being held in custody. The Western Australian Labor party passed a motion at its state party conference in September to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14. The state’s attorney general, John Quigley, led the working group of the national council of attorneys general, which in a leaked draft report recommended the age of criminal responsibility be lifted to 14, or failing that, to 12, with a minimum age of detention at 14. To date only the Australian Capital Territory has pledged to introduce the reform.",News/Australia news,Aboriginal children ‘kept in detention’ despite being granted bail in Western Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/28/aboriginal-children-kept-in-detention-despite-being-granted-bail-in-western-australia
