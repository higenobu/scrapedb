3/3/2022,"Netflix has paused all future Russian projects and acquisitions as a result of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. According to Variety, the streamer is “assessing the impact of current events”, which has led to four Russian original series being indefinitely paused. Zato, a crime series set after the fall of the Soviet Union, directed by the Belarus-born director Darya Zhuk, was already in production but has now been put on hold. Netflix also has another three series in the pipeline in Russia, including Anna K, based on Anna Karenina. The service launched in the country just over a year ago and is believed to have about 1 million subscribers. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it would refuse to broadcast Russian state propaganda, in the face of a law that just came into effect. It requires streaming services with more than 100,000 daily users to carry 20 major Russian federal television channels, many of which broadcast Kremlin propaganda. The past few days have seen an increasing pushback from Hollywood against Russia, including Disney, Warner Bros, Paramount, Sony and Universal all delaying their upcoming film releases. Titles affected include Turning Red, The Batman, Morbius and Sonic the Hedgehog 2. “We will make future business decisions based on the evolving situation,” a Disney spokesperson said in a statement. “In the meantime, given the scale of the emerging refugee crisis, we are working with our NGO partners to provide urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance to refugees.” The Cannes film festival has stated that no Russian delegations or attendees with ties to the government will be welcomed in May. The European Film Academy also announced that Russian films will not be eligible for the next European Film Awards. “We are fully aware that several of our members are fighting with arms against the aggressor,” a statement read.

3/3/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has appealed to Jewish people across the world to speak out against the Russian assault on his country, a day after a missile hit close to a Holocaust memorial site in the capital, Kyiv. The missile strike on Tuesday hit Kyiv’s television tower, reportedly killing at least five people. The tower is located close to the memorial site of Babyn Yar, the ravine where Nazi soldiers massacred up to 150,000 people during the second world war, including more than 30,000 Jews, who were shot there in the autumn of 1941 after the Nazi takeover of Kyiv. “For any normal person who knows history, Babyn Yar is a special part of Kyiv, a special part of Europe,” said Zelenskiy, in one of the regular video addresses he has been making throughout the war. “It is a place of prayer and a place of remembrance for the 100,000 people killed by the Nazis … Who do you think you are, to make it a target for your missiles?” During the Soviet period a television tower and other buildings were constructed on the site, but in 2016 the Ukrainian government along with Jewish groups and philanthropists launched a project to create a major new Holocaust memorial centre there. Yad Vashem, the Holocaust remembrance centre in Israel, issued a “vehement condemnation” of Tuesday’s attack. Yair Lapid, the Israeli foreign minister, said: “We call for the sanctity of the site to be preserved and honoured.” However, he did not directly condemn Russia in his words. Zelenskiy, keen to rally more support from Israel and also from Jewish communities worldwide, also mentioned that the city of Uman, a pilgrimage site for Orthodox Jews from the Hasidic Breslov movement, was hit on the first night of the war. “I am now addressing all the Jews of the world – don’t you see what is happening? It is very important that right now, millions of Jews around the world do not remain silent. Nazism is born in silence,” said Zelenskiy. Under Vladimir Putin, the Soviet victory in the second world war has become a major building block of Russian national identity, and Putin has attempted to portray modern Russia as the inheritor of this proud anti-Nazi heritage, even as his government has targeted minorities, reduced freedoms and is now waging an expansionist war. Russia has claimed its military action in Ukraine is aimed at “denazifying” the country, alleging that since the Maidan revolution in 2014, Ukraine has been run by a far-right cabal. President Putin has referred to the government in Kyiv as “a band of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”. This is despite the fact that Zelenskiy is Jewish and came to power after a democratic election in which he beat the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko. A statement from the management board of the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial centre, released on Tuesday before the missile strike said: “Russia has vulgarly instrumentalised anti-Nazi rhetoric and is trying to take on the role of a fighter against Nazism. “We remind the Russian leadership that Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities were last subjected to massive bombing by Nazi Germany during world war two. Now they are burning under the blows of Putin’s army, under the false and outrageous narrative of ‘denazifying’ Ukraine and its people.” While there is a far-right movement in Ukraine, and elements of it have been active in fighting against Russia-backed forces in the east of the country, the movement has little political power or influence on the government. The Russian government has persisted with its narrative of a neo-Nazi government oppressing Russian speakers, despite the fact that Zelenskiy’s native language is Russian. “It’s absolute and total nonsense,” said Rabbi Moshe Azman, the chief rabbi of Ukraine. “The country has democracy, it has freedom of speech and the president is Jewish. It’s simply a lie. The far-right parties didn’t even get into parliament.” Azman, who was born in Leningrad, now St Petersburg, recorded an angry appeal to Russians and Russian Jews on Tuesday, clutching a Torah and criticising the lack of public outcry in Russia against the war. “Remember that the people who are indifferent become accomplices in crimes against humanity,” he said.",News/World news,Ukraine president asks Jewish people around world to speak against Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/ukraine-president-asks-jewish-people-around-world-to-speak-against-russia
3/3/2022,"The signal from the White House was clear. Joe Biden is “very open” to the idea of adding oil and gas to the sanctions list as a way of escalating the west’s economic war against Vladimir Putin. Surging oil prices suggest traders think the die has already been cast: whether because governments take action directly or whether through self-sanctioning from western companies, oil and gas supplies from Russia are going to dry up. That will have serious consequences for Russia, but it will also add to cost of living pressures in the west. Even before this week’s rise in crude oil prices to more than $110 (£82) a barrel – the highest since 2014 – analysts were cutting growth forecasts and raising estimates for inflation. Including energy in the list of items targeted would mean oil and gas would be dearer for longer, increasing the risk of a slowdown turning into recession. The world economy is less dependent on oil than it was at the time of the first postwar spike in 1973-4, and uses the fossil fuel more efficiently. Back then it took a little less than a barrel of oil to produce $1,000 of output. By 2019 global oil intensity was 0.43 of a barrel per $1,000 of output. Even so, what happens to the oil price still matters and Russia – which is the second biggest exporter after Saudi Arabia – is a key player in the global market. So far, most economists think Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will merely dent the recovery they have pencilled in for this year. But as the Warwick University academic Prof Andrew Oswald has noted, almost every postwar recession has been preceded by a rise in oil prices. The cost of crude rose sharply in 1973, in 1979, in 1990 and in 2007. All were followed by recessions, though sometimes dearer energy was not the only factor. Three factors will determine the hit to western economies over the coming months. The first is whether energy continues to flow, something that is looking less likely by the day. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB bank, estimates that 70% of the 4.3m barrels of crude Russia would normally be exporting daily is already frozen. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said the latest jump in oil prices reflected a sense that formal sanctions on Russia’s energy sector were inevitable. Rising oil prices were a windfall for the Kremlin, Wilson added. “This is one of the reasons why western governments might play this card – the cognitive dissonance of squeezing Russia on all fronts with sanctions while still funding their war machine by buying oil and gas may not survive for long.” The second factor involves the size and the duration of higher oil prices. Most analysts assume crude will rise a little further – perhaps to $125 a barrel – and then start falling in the second half of the year. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, says if oil and gas follow current futures pricing, UK inflation would peak at just below 8% in April and still be above 5% by the end of the year. Under an alternative scenario the oil price rises to $130 a barrel and stays above $100 a barrel until early 2023, while European wholesale gas prices rise to €160 (£133) a megawatt hour and end this year around €100 a MWh. In that event, Dales says inflation would peak above 8% and still be nudging 6% by the end of the year. Some fear the oil price could hit $150 a barrel, intensifying the squeeze on consumers. Businesses would also be hit, with more expensive energy and lower demand hitting profits. Finally, there is the question of how central banks will respond. Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said events in Ukraine would not derail plans by the US central bank to start raising interest rates. The Bank of England, which has already increased borrowing costs twice in recent months, is also likely to tighten policy. What is not yet clear is how far and how fast interest rates will rise. One risk is that central banks do too little. An even bigger risk is that they do too much.",News/Business,Recessions tend to follow oil price surges – will this time be different?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/02/recessions-oil-price-surges
3/3/2022,"My cousin Andrzej Twardzicki, who has died aged 94, came to the UK after fighting with the Polish resistance during the second world war and settled in Britain, where he became an engineer and then an academic, lecturing at Queen Mary University of London and running postgraduate courses at Imperial College London. Andrzej was brought up in Kraków but born in Lwów, in the Ukrainian part of what was then the new republic of Poland, to Jadwiga (nee Siedlecka), who worked for the Red Cross as a translator, and her husband, Tadeusz, an adviser to the Polish ministry of agriculture. When Germany invaded Poland in 1939 his father joined the resistance, dying in a motorcycle accident on a secret mission, after which Andrzej’s older brother, Franek, joined the resistance in Warsaw and was killed a year later. Andrzej himself then joined up in Kraków, and took part in several ambushes of German patrols. In 1945, fearing the consequences of the Red Army’s approach towards Poland, he set off with two friends, reaching the safety of a sector of southern Germany, where he joined Polish II Corps, the operational unit of the Polish Armed Forces in the west. He was sent by ship to Scotland, where he lived in barracks for two years, learning English and managing to pass his general matriculation, after which he went to London University to study electrical engineering. After graduating, Andrzej worked for British Thomson-Houston, an engineering and heavy industrial company, in Rugby, Warwickshire. It was in Rugby that he met his landlady’s niece, Halina Kornela, a fellow Pole, who had lost both parents during the second world war and had come to Britain with her aunt. Andrzej coached her through her A-levels and two years later they got engaged. One of their first holidays together was an expedition to the Alps. Halina went on to study medicine and became a doctor. After they got married in 1962, the couple enjoyed an adventurous road trip through Europe, all the way to Yugoslavia. Back in Rugby, their first child, Anna, was born and Andrzej joined GEC, designing generators for ships and power stations and other big infrastructure projects, including the Kariba dam in Zimbabwe. After completing a master’s degree he began a long career in academia, eventually becoming senior lecturer in electrical engineering at Queen Mary University of London and running postgraduate courses at Imperial College London. After retirement in 1985, Andrzej did some freelance work for another decade and made many trips to Poland. A keen photographer, he captured some dramatic images of Kraków in 1983, when it had fallen under martial law. He worked for several charities, including Medical Aid For Poland, accompanying long-distance lorries to deliver medical equipment to hospitals during the clampdown on the Solidarity trade union. A keen walker and mountaineer, for some years he worked as a volunteer climbing guide in the Austrian Alps and the Tatra mountains in Poland.

3/3/2022,"A week ago the sight was unthinkable: a memorial at the site of one of the worst massacres of the Holocaust, engulfed in smoke and flame from an airstrike. Yet on Tuesday a Russian attack near the Babyn Yar memorial complex in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, achieved exactly that. Five people died in the strike targeting the television broadcast tower next door, while firefighters battled to extinguish a fire caused by the explosion in a building inside the Jewish cemetery. Events in Ukraine since Vladimir Putin announced his invasion six days ago are grim echoes of the atrocities committed on European soil in the 20th century: desperate people squeezing on to trains out of cities; refugees lining up on the border; families separated as able-bodied men stay behind to fight. But government officials in Israel – a country that rose from the ashes of the second world war – have not directly condemned Moscow for the attack on Babyn Yar, and criticism of the invasion itself has been muted. Such is the balancing act Israel finds itself performing as war once again rages on the edge of Europe. On one hand it must stand with its western allies, support Ukraine’s Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and help the country’s Jewish population to escape new horrors. But on the other, Israel is loth to antagonise Russia, on which it relies to facilitate its military operations next door in Syria. Action of any kind could also stir up antisemitism against Ukraine and Russia’s large Jewish communities. Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust museum, has even found itself in the peculiar position of writing to the US ambassador to ask the US not to impose sanctions on the Israeli-Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who is a major donor to Jewish institutions. The former prime minister Ehud Olmert has suggested Israel’s position on Ukraine is implicitly compromised by its occupation of the Palestinian territories. And the country’s belated decision to vote in favour of a UN condemnation of Russia’s actions and to hold off on sanctions was met with disappointment from its US allies, coming “too little, too late,” according to a senior Israeli official who spoke to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth. “Countries that have far more to lose have taken a clear stance. Only Israel, which is always good at reminding others about how they failed to stand by the Jewish people during dark times, has done everything not to do anything,” the source said. Yedioth Ahronoth also reported that in a phone call with Zelenskiy on Friday, the current prime minister, Naftali Bennett, denied Kyiv’s request that Israel supply arms, adhering to a longstanding Israeli policy designed to avoid provoking Russia. In the same call, Zelenskiy reportedly also asked Israel to mediate in the crisis – an appeal that appears to have borne more fruit, since Bennett made an offer to do so in a conversation with Putin two days later. But even as Israelis with Ukrainian heritage sign up to defend Kyiv, for Israel’s security establishment, Europe’s new war is still a remote concern compared with dealing with the hostile forces on its own borders. Containing Iranian activity remains the country’s number one priority. Russian intervention in Syria’s civil war in 2015 turned the tide of the conflict in Bashar al-Assad’s favour. Moscow is now the major power in Syria’s skies, dropping bombs on Syrian civilians in areas still outside the regime’s control, and allowing the Israeli air force to operate against Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed groups active in the conflict. Michael Herzog, Israel’s ambassador to the US, said in a tweet on Wednesday: “While our moral position [on Ukraine] is clear, we are striving to pursue it in a way that will maintain our freedom of operations against Iran in the region, which is in everybody’s interest.” In the meantime, the first Israeli shipment of humanitarian aid has arrived on the Polish-Ukrainian border, which includes 17 tons of medical equipment and medicine as well as winter tents and sleeping bags for 3,000 people. About 200,000 Ukranians with Jewish ancestry are eligible for Israeli citizenship, and Tel Aviv is expecting an influx of between 10,000 and 15,000 people in the coming weeks. Shmuel Shpack, the Ukraine director for the Jewish Agency, which brings Jewish immigrants to Israel, said: “I never imagined I would end up doing what I am doing today. I’ve seen things I never thought I would see in my life, it’s like world war II, people sitting in lines for two days.” He has barely slept in the last week, fielding 200 phone calls a day from refugees at his new makeshift operations centre on the frontier with Poland. “Like everyone else, until the last moment we weren’t sure something was going to happen,” he said. “But now we have seen we have to prepare for full-scale war.”",News/World news,Israel tries to balance backing for Ukrainians and not offending Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/israel-tries-to-balance-backing-for-ukrainians-and-not-offending-russia
3/3/2022,"The White House released a 96-page plan on Wednesday to shift the fight against Covid-19 and “help move America forward safely”, past a crisis footing to a new “normal”. Announcement of the plan follows promises made in Joe Biden’s State of the Union speech late on Tuesday, which emphasized rapid rollout of a new “test to treat” model with free anti-viral pills after a positive test. This comes just a week after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) loosened mask guidance nationally, as more and more Democratic leaders have lifted pandemic-era restrictions and with the president urging workers to return to the office in-person. “We are moving forward safely, getting back to our more normal routines, and under the latest CDC recommendations most Americans in most of the country can now be mask-free,” said the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, Jeff Zients. Vaccinated Americans, he said, “have an extremely high level of protection against Covid, and it’s extremely unlikely you’ll end up in the hospital if you get the virus”. The administration’s plan has four main pillars: protect against and treat Covid-19 cases, prepare for new variants, prevent business and school closures and continue to distribute vaccines globally. Within those pillars are a mix of short- and long-term goals, many of which will require congressional funding. In the short-term, a “test to treat” model is expected to be rolled out this month. The model will allow people to be tested for Covid-19 and receive antiviral medication in “one step” at pharmacies, veterans’ centers and long-term care facilities nationally. The White House has also said it will seek to buy more vaccines, treatments such as monoclonal antibodies and antiviral pills, and tests and masks. Beyond the short-term goals, administration officials proposed a slate of long-term investments, including research for a pan-Covid-19 vaccine, national “centers of excellence” to treat so-called long Covid, and the ability to develop, manufacture and approve a vaccine within 100 days should a new variant arise. “We will have to contend with Covid at some level for some time to come,” said Dr Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser. “This ongoing research investment is not only helping us turn the corner on Covid-19, but is vital to helping us prepare for future pandemics.” However, how much funding the administration is asking for remains unclear. Zients said the White House would “communicate that number to Congress” as it is finalized. It has already briefed congressional leaders on the need for short-term purchases. The White House announcement and State of the Union address also came with a new look and feel. At the State of the Union, Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris and the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, were all mask-free. So, too, were White House officials when they announced the new Covid-19 plan, notably in-person rather than through a group video call. The White House has said repeatedly this is not a plan to “live with Covid”, any more than Americans “accept ‘living with’ cancer, Alzheimer’s, or Aids”. The new strategic footing from the administration has received a mixed response. Some public health leaders reacted with excitement to the “test to treat” plan, but revised CDC guidance has received a more tepid response. Critics have argued that the widespread end of masking shifts the burden of preventing Covid-19 to “vulnerable individuals”, and could be premature given past pandemic surges. However, the mood of the country may have already shifted – Americans of every political stripe have reported a high degree of frustration and exhaustion with the pandemic, according to recent surveys. Progress to global vaccination has been slow, putting the world at risk of new variants. To date, 64.4% of the world has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, but there is a gulf between high- and low-income countries. Just 13% of people in low-income nations have received a vaccine, compared with 79% in high- and upper-middle-income nations.",News/World news,White House unveils Covid strategy to usher in new normal as pandemic eases,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/white-house-new-covid-strategy-test-to-treat

She was also tremendous fun – creating art, blowing bubbles, capturing the perfect sunset, and going off on adventures in her sports cars. Those who knew her were inspired by her sense of justice, but also her impeccable taste in furniture, design, clothing and gardening. Joan was born in Carlton, Nottingham, the middle of three children; she had two brothers, Raymond and Barrie. Her mother and father, Hilda (nee Matthews) and Charles Hart, had a tailor’s shop, where the family lived and worked. She left school at 14, and when the second world war broke out she become an auxiliary nurse. After the war, she joined the Young Christian Workers (YCW). In 2018, as part of the NHS at 70 oral history project, she recorded her memories of the long months of campaigning outdoors for the creation of the NHS. Her campaigning continued into the 1950s with Action Against Poverty. Through the YCW she met her husband, Ted Meredith. They married in 1951, but he died in 1959 of an under-researched condition. It was then that she decided to leave her body for research. Joan trained as a youth worker in 1961, which led to her becoming Manchester’s first full-time YCW organiser. She moved to the city in 1962 and lived there for the rest of her life. After studying social work at the University of Sheffield, she became a social worker in the Catholic Children’s Rescue Society, before leading an innovative student unit in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, for 25 years. Her work was groundbreaking and she was a powerful advocate of early intervention and family support. While working as a social worker Joan also trained as a psychotherapist. She believed strongly in the importance of supervising and mentoring colleagues – caring for the carers. With a small group of like-minded, pioneering colleagues she was instrumental in establishing the concept of providing good staff care in the workplace, and inspired senior managers to follow her lead. She set up a staff care support service that offered counselling and supervision to frontline care workers and organisations. This enabled so many to continue in their challenging work. The provision of staff care support is now established practice in organisations providing social and healthcare. She continued to supervise until she retired at the age of 91.

3/3/2022,"Progressive Democrats notched victories in two of Texas’s congressional primary races on Tuesday while Ken Paxton, one of the most prominent Republicans in the state and Donald Trump ally, suffered a major blow. In the most closely watched congressional primary, Jessica Cisneros, a progressive Democrat, forced a runoff against Henry Cuellar, a nine-term congressman who is one of the most conservative Democrats in the US House. (Texas races go to a runoff if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote.) Forcing a runoff is a major win for Cisneros, who narrowly lost to Cuellar two years ago. Cuellar has been dogged by corruption allegations after an FBI raid of his home and office earlier this year. Cisneros has been endorsed by the progressive group Justice Democrats, plus Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Joshua Blank, the research director of the Texas Politics Project at Austin, said it was difficult to predict whether Cuellar would ultimately prevail. “Handicapping his chances is difficult, because on the one hand, he likely has significant organization in the district, but on the other, an incumbent in a strong position shouldn’t find himself in so much trouble,” he said. “The focus has been on Cisneros’ progressivism and whether she can win in the general, but Cuellar is one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress and somewhat idiosyncratic within the party, so how this will turn out is anyone’s guess.” Progressives also scored another victory in a new congressional district that stretches from Austin to San Antonio. Greg Casar, a progressive favorite who led efforts to reduce the police budget on the Austin city council, easily won his party’s nomination. He is expected to easily win in the general election in November. In the Dallas area, Jasmine Crockett, described as one of the most liberal members of the Texas house of representatives, is headed to a runoff election against Jane Hope Hamilton. Paxton, the attorney general, was forced into a runoff with George P Bush, the Texas land commissioner and the face of a new generation of one of America’s most prominent political dynasties (his uncle is George W Bush). Paxton, who was endorsed by the former president, is one of the most outspoken conservative attorneys general in the country, and has been at the forefront of attacks on voting, abortion access, immigration and transgender Americans. He also led an unsuccessful lawsuit asking the US supreme court to overturn the 2020 election. But the fact that he is being forced into a runoff underscores how politically vulnerable he may be. He has been under indictment since 2015 for securities fraud and faces whistleblower allegations that he misused his office for personal gain. “Paxton will likely have an easier time with Bush, whose name and legacy in Texas carry a mixed set of baggage,” said Blank. Trump nonetheless tried to frame Tuesday’s results in Texas as a mark of his political strength. He noted that the dozens of Republican candidates he endorsed in the race either won or were headed to a runoff. But virtually all of the candidates Trump endorsed were running in non-competitive primaries and were expected to win. Trump also notably did not endorse Van Taylor, a Republican seeking re-election to Congress in the Dallas suburbs. Taylor voted in favor of a bipartisan 6 January commission, which drew ire from Republicans and several challengers. Taylor will now face a runoff against Keith Self, a former Collin county judge, who told the Texas Tribune that the congressman’s vote for a commission was a “huge issue”. Taylor’s district is one of several in Texas that was redrawn last year to become solidly more Republican. In 2020, his district was highly competitive – Trump narrowly carried it by 1 percentage point. Trump would have carried the district by 14 points under the new lines, according to Planscore. It’s a trend that illustrates how lawmakers are redrawing districts to make them less competitive, a move that benefits extreme candidates in the primary. Looming over the primary were sweeping new voting restrictions in Texas, in effect for the first time after Republicans in the state legislature passed them last year. Texas already limits mail-in voting to those aged 65 or older, or who have a qualifying excuse. For weeks, local election officials have been raising alarms that new identification requirements for mail-in ballots are causing them to reject tens of thousands of them. Lisa Wise, the election administrator in El Paso county, said earlier this week her office had flagged 27% of the 3,855 ballots it received so far for rejection. In Harris county, the most populous in the state, officials had flagged 10,876 ballots, 29% of those returned, for potential rejections. Leah Shah, a county spokeswoman, said the office was working to contact voters and get them to come in person to the election office to correct issues on their ballots. Voters have until Monday to come to the election office and fix defects in person. “The current numbers are unprecedented, far outpacing previous rejection rates. This outcome could have been avoidable if federal protections were in place,” said Mimi Marzani, the president of the Texas Civil Rights Project.",News/US news,Success for progressives in Texas while Trump ally suffers major blow,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/02/texas-primaries-trump-ally-ken-paxton-progressives
3/3/2022,"The west has severed trading relationships with Vladimir Putin’s Russia on a scale thought unimaginable only a week ago. As tanks edge towards Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, governments around the world have taken coordinated action, using sanctions to target Russia’s banking system, state-controlled companies and powerful oligarchs. Under self-imposed restrictions, companies in Europe and the US have followed suit, with energy firms severing corporate ties and brands refusing to export their consumer goods. Here are the actions taken so far: The day after Russia invaded Ukraine, excluding Russian banks from Swift was described by one EU minister as a “very last resort”. Now it is happening: under EU sanctions, seven Russian banks, including VTB, the second-largest, will be excluded from Belgian-based Swift, the bank messaging system that underpins global trade. Being locked out of the world’s dominant bank messaging system means Russia will have to resort to more cumbersome alternatives, possibly fax machines, although Russia’s central bank says it has a domestic equivalent. Sberbank and Gazprombank, Russia’s largest and third-largest lenders, which are used for oil and gas payments, were not cut off from Swift. These banks, however, have been under sanctions limiting their access to EU capital markets since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In another unprecedented strike against a G20 economy, Brussels, Washington and London have banned Russia’s central bank from accessing foreign currency reserves – a devastating move when a sizeable chunk of its $640bn war chest is held in dollars, euros and sterling. This will make it much harder for Russia’s central bank to prop up the rouble, which crashed to a record low on Monday, threatening rampant inflation and a crisis in living standards for ordinary Russians. The UK government has blacklisted a handful of business people already subject to US sanctions and claims to be preparing a “hitlist” of oligarchs with links to Putin, but has taken no action so far. However, Boris Johnson has backed the formation of a property register that would identify Russian oligarchs, a move that the Labour MP Chris Bryant said prompted Chelsea owner and Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich to begin selling his £200m portfolio of homes. Officials in Brussels have already moved to ban prominent individuals from travelling to and from the EU and frozen the assets they hold in the region, along with 53 businesses and organisations connected to the Russian state. Alexei Mordashov, who owns a third of the London-listed tour operator Tui – Europe’s biggest – is on the EU list. Igor Sechin, 61, the chief executive of Rosneft, the state oil company and one of the world’s largest crude oil producers, is another in the EU’s sights. Sergei Roldugin, 71, the former principal cellist of the Kirov Opera Theatre’s orchestra in the 1980s and godfather to Putin’s eldest daughter, Maria, is also among those it is claimed are threatening the territorial integrity of Ukraine. At least 30 countries have banned Russian planes from their airspace, deepening Russia’s isolation from the world. The US became the latest to announce a prohibition of all Russian passenger, cargo and charter flights, joining Canada, the EU and the UK. Moscow has responded with tit-for-tat bans that end the busy flow of traffic in the skies. Before the ban, 300 flights a day left Russia to land or fly over the EU, while EU carriers landed 50 planes and flew 90 over the world’s biggest country by land area. In a move targeting oligarchs, Russian nationals will not be able to charter planes to fly into the EU or use private jets in the UK. The move will also impose costs on western planes bound for Asia that will be obliged to make costly and time-consuming detours around Siberia. EU officials estimate an extra four hours could be added to a flight from northern Europe to an Asian destination. Western governments are also considering further bans on marine traffic after the UK became the first to announce it would stop ships and yachts “with any Russian connection” docking at its ports. The European parliament has urged the EU to enact this policy and officials think it is likely to be adopted. Apple said it was pausing sales in Russia while Nike prevented Russian customers from buying online, joining a growing list of companies to distance themselves from the country in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Nike confirmed it was switching off web sales in Russia, although the brand said on its Russian website that shoppers could visit local Nike stores, of which there are several in Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities. Meta, which owns Facebook, said posts from Russian state media are no longer being recommended to users by Facebook’s algorithm, with Instagram to soon follow suit, according to the tech news website, The Verge. This development comes after the company said it restricted access to Russian state media accounts in Ukraine, blocked Russian state media from running ads on the platform and said it took down posts related to a disinformation campaign targeting Ukraine. The carmaker Ford suspended its commercial van joint venture in Russia “until further notice”. It is among several automakers, including rival General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover and Renault, to halt sales and operations in Russia in the last few days. Adidas, Europe’s largest sportswear manufacturer, suspended its partnership with the Russian Football Union, while The Walt Disney Company, which owns Marvel Studios, 20th Century Studios and Pixar, said it was pausing its release of films in Russia, including its anticipated Pixar film Turning Red, “given the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the tragic humanitarian crisis”. A spokesperson for Netflix told The Wall Street Journal that “given the current situation” the streaming service has no plans to distribute news, sports and entertainment channels from Russian state media, despite a new Russian regulation that requires organisations with more than 100,000 subscribers to carry them, according to a source familiar with the matter. The British online clothing retailer Asos suspended sales on Wednesday, saying trading in Russia was no longer “practical nor right”. Airbnb said it will provide free, short-term housing for 100,000 refugees who have fled Ukraine, which will be paid for by the company and through donations. In the same vein, the online marketplace Etsy said it was cancelling all balances owed to the company by sellers in Ukraine, including listing and advertising fees, amounting to roughly $4m (£3m), to alleviate financial hardships felt by those in the country. Russia’s largest foreign investor, BP, led the way with its surprising announcement on Sunday that it would exit its 20% stake in state-controlled Rosneft, a move that could result in a $25bn write-off and cut its global oil and gas production by a third.Shell will end its joint ventures with Russian state energy firm Gazprom, which are worth about $3bn and were poised to generate huge profits for the company over the next 30 years. The planned sales include its 27.5% stake in the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility, its 50% stake in the Salym Petroleum Development and the Gydan energy venture. Shell will also end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, in which it holds a 10% stake worth $1bn. Nord Stream 2 was halted by the German government after the invasion of Ukraine. ExxonMobil, the US oil major, operates the Sakhalin-1 project on behalf of a consortium of Japanese, Indian and Russian companies. It said: “We are beginning the process to discontinue operations and developing steps to exit the Sakhalin-1 venture,” though it added that environmental and safety concerns meant this may take some time to complete.",News/World news,Sanctions and boycotts: the west’s response to Russian invasion of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/sanctions-boycotts-west-response-russian-invasion-ukraine
3/3/2022,"Two English councils are blacklisting a key Russian-owned gas supplier in a show of solidarity with Ukraine. Merton council in London has announced it is seeking to cancel its contract with Gazprom Energy less than a month before the company is due to begin a new one-year, £1m contract to supply gas across Merton’s buildings, including leisure centres, libraries and some schools. The council leader, Mark Allison, said: “I have asked officers to urgently review options to bring this contract agreement to an end to show our unity and empathy with the people of Ukraine. The atrocities being carried out by Russia are horrific. Any small step we can take is a step that must be taken.” The council has written to the government to ask for urgent changes to the laws around who councils can choose to do business with. “Under law all council contracts are commercially driven,” said Allison. “We need the ability to refuse to do business with such firms based on their moral or social suitability, not just their commercial offer.” Suffolk county council has also said it will break away from its £10m contract with the energy supplier. Its deal with the supplier started in 2020 and is due to run until 2023 but the council leader, Matthew Hicks, said the county was “actively pursuing” ending the contract early. Gazprom Energy, a subsidiary of Russia’s state-owned gas and oil giant, has been one of the largest suppliers of gas for UK businesses since 2010, accounting for about 20.8% of the market. The company provides gas and electricity to NHS sites, factories, businesses and public sector customers across the UK. According to its latest annual report, it supplied gas to 178,000 sites across the country in 2020. But as scrutiny mounts on the role of the Russian state energy giant in the UK, the owner of British Gas Centrica has also announced it is seeking to exit its deal with Gazprom “as a matter of urgency”. Centrica signed a gas supply contract with Gazprom’s UK-based trading arm in 2012 and has twice extended it, with the current deal due to run until summer 2025. But Chris O’Shea, Centrica’s chief executive, confirmed it had now entered into discussions with Gazprom about exiting this agreement. Shell announced it would “exit its joint ventures with Gazprom and related entities”, which are worth about $3bn and include its 27.5% stake in the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility. Last week BP said it would offload its 19.75% voting stake in the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft.",News/Business,English councils seek to end contracts with Russian-owned gas firm ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/02/english-councils-seek-to-end-contracts-with-russian-owned-gas-firm
3/3/2022,"Your editorials on foreign policy in Europe and the increasing barbarity of Vladimir Putin’s assault were both insightful and powerful. But they failed to address the roots of this catastrophic failure of so-called diplomacy. Principled foreign policy has long been mocked by neoliberals and politicians of all stripes in favour of “interests”. We should now understand where interest-based foreign policy has brought us. What’s more, it is hypocritical and craven. Interests were sufficient to justify and fight wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a myriad of smaller regions, but now its hegemony has brought us Russian hubris and fatal prevarication in the face of Putin’s crystal clear intention. Faced with this, European politicians succumbed to “motivated reasoning”, believing what their sclerotic diplomacy told them. What makes me despair is that even now there is an unwillingness to confront this. The opposite side of this counterfeit coin is the impotence of the UN and other multinational assemblies to confront unilateral transgressions. We have also contrived to bring this about through interests. We have looked away, offering only rhetoric where we calculated that our interests are more or less safe. Now that it’s in the heart of Europe, we cannot look away. Furthermore, the climate and biodiversity catastrophe means that this luxury of looking over the wall has evaporated. Economic and political connectivity can be manipulated to protect our interests. That is not even a remote possibility in the face of ecosystem collapse. Europe does not need a new foreign policy – we need a new global constitution and contract.Neil BlackshawCallian, Var, France  The danger of enforcing a no-fly zone is, your editorial says, “both obvious and immense”. Failing to level up the playing field between Ukraine and Russia is equally dangerous. At some point, the threat will have to be faced. A no-fly zone, together with a threat to take out the column advancing on Kiev, could well be the least risky way forward. At least it may stiffen the sinews of Russia’s generals. Failure to counter nuclear blackmail will mean giving carte blanche to Vladimir Putin. An early display of military resolve may well reduce the risk rather than enhance it.Roy BoffySutton Coldfield, West Midlands  Some of your correspondents (Letters, 25 February) have a strange idea about the fall of communism and the roles of Nato and the EU. I don’t recall any “triumphalism” at the fall of communism – only a feeling of relief that the people of eastern Europe could have greater freedom. For me, it meant that my friends and relatives from former eastern bloc countries could now freely visit me and I could visit them. Individual members of Nato and the EU can be “triumphalist”, but the organisations themselves can only represent what their members want. Blaming Nato and the EU for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is like blaming a child for a bully attacking him when the kid says he’d like to join his mates as a member of the local football club. The bully is entirely to blame for the unprovoked attack, just as Putin and his acolytes are entirely to blame for their unprovoked attack on Ukraine and, in the same way, Hitler and the Nazis were entirely to blame for their unprovoked attack on Poland.Sally ChurchillGraigwen, Rhondda Cynon Taf  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/3/2022,"Regarding Prince Charles’s new project at Dumfries House in Ayrshire (Prince Charles gets go-ahead for farming school in Scotland, 27 February), is he not aware that Scotland already has six countrywide centres of excellence teaching agricultural studies from national certificate level to degree and postgraduate study? One of them is in fact near Dumfries House, the Ayr campus of Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC). As well as offering six teaching and research facilities, SRUC also has eight farms, 25 consulting offices and eight veterinary practices. Instead of raising money to fund a new farm-skills school, it would be better to liaise with the present network of agricultural colleges and work with them to promote traditional skills within existing courses or to establish new courses. Elitist members of the establishment and government are largely ignorant of the vital role that further education colleges play in many young people’s education and training. They are grossly underfunded and ignored in favour of universities. They deserve more recognition and financial support for their role in offering well-supported, achievable stepping stones to qualifications in further and higher education for learners of all ages.Margaret McGregorAberdeen  Interesting to read that Prince Charles is to start a farming school in Ayrshire. Not too many miles further south, Newton Rigg agricultural college in north Cumbria finally closed in July 2021. Apparently it was not financially viable.

3/3/2022,"Polly Toynbee is right to highlight the capacity for a one-off wealth tax to raise serious money (How to save our precious public services? A windfall tax on those who got rich from Covid, 23 February). But she misquotes me to say that a 10% tax on UK wealth would yield £1tn. At the Wealth Tax Commission we studied various options for a one-off tax. In our final report we noted that a wealth tax beginning below £500,000 would be a non-starter, given the difficulties that many individuals would have in paying it. A 10% tax on all wealth would certainly not be practical, and is not something that I would support. The International Monetary Fund recently adopted our proposal for a one-off tax on the top 1% of wealth holders: those with net wealth above £2m. If payable as 1% a year over five years this would raise £80bn over the lifetime of the tax. This tax has three big things going for it. First, it is efficient. It doesn’t discourage work, unlike the rise in national insurance contributions. Second, it is fairer than alternatives. Like Margaret Thatcher’s one-off bank tax, it also offsets some of the side effects of monetary policy. In the 1980s, high rates boosted banks’ profits. Now, low rates have boosted house and stock prices. Third, it raises serious cash. But while £80bn is a lot, it is only 2% of government revenues over the lifetime of the tax. On its own it won’t “save our public services”. A one-off wealth tax is a good idea, but we need to also recognise its limits.Prof Arun AdvaniWealth Tax Commission and University of Warwick  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/3/2022,"A fine of £9.4m for betting firms is peanuts (Report, 1 March). A more appropriate fine would be something like twice the total emoluments (salary, pension and bonuses) paid to the senior executives and boards of the firms for the previous two years. Fines that bite might produce better behaviour – and not just in the betting industry.Ted PawleyMilton Keynes  While I can support a Hippocratic oath for engineers and scientists (Letters, 1 March), I feel MPs should make public declarations that they will act with probity and the highest standards of integrity in the representation of their constituency and the exercise of office in government. A simple extension to the oath of allegiance to the crown should suffice.Charlie LeventonShrewsbury, Shropshire  I can’t think of anyone who deserves a radio programme less than Mary Whitehouse. To suggest that she was ahead of her time is laughable (Ahead of her time? Programme re-evaluates Mary Whitehouse’s legacy, 1 March). She was a Victorian values conservative who never questioned the morality of the upper classes. The programme will please those nostalgic for Margaret Thatcher, who admired Whitehouse.
