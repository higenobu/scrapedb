5/17/2022,"Price levels continue to rise at a rate we haven’t seen in decades. In April, U.S. consumer prices surged 8.3% — down slightly from 8.5% in March, but still near 40-year highs. Spiking inflation has severe consequences for your cash savings. Fortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has plenty of advice on what to own when consumer prices spike. In a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two business traits that investors should look for when trying to fight inflation: 1) the power to increase prices easily, and 2) the ability to take on more business without having to spend excessively. Here are four Berkshire holdings that largely boast those characteristics. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Last year, American Express demonstrated its pricing power as it raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card from $550 to $695. The company also stands to directly benefit in an inflationary environment. American Express makes most of its money through discount fees — merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills. Business is booming. In Q1, the company’s revenue jumped 29% year over year to $11.7 billion. American Express is the fifth-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire’s stake is worth nearly $24 billion. Berkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller. American Express shares currently offer a dividend yield of 1.3%. Coca-Cola is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable to most people. The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power. Add solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago. Buffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late ’80s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $25.8 billion. You can lock in a dividend yield of 2.7% on Coca-Cola's shares at current prices. No one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 13 Pro Max would call it a steal. But consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway. Earlier last year, management revealed that the company’s active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.65 billion devices, including over 1 billion iPhones. While competitors offer cheaper devices, many consumers don’t want to live outside the Apple ecosystem. That means, as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying too much about a drop in sales volume. Today, Apple is Buffett’s largest publicly traded holding, representing nearly 40% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value. Of course, the sheer increase in Apple’s stock price is one of the reasons for that concentration. Over the past five years, shares of the tech gorilla have surged more than 280%. Apple currently offers a dividend yield of 0.6%. One of Buffett’s big moves in 2022 is loading up on Chevron. According to an SEC filing, Berkshire owned $25.9 billion of the energy giant as of Mar. 31 — a significant jump from its stake of $4.5 billion at the end of 2021. Today, Chevron represents the third-largest public holding at Berkshire. It’s not difficult to understand why. Even though the oil business is capital intensive, it tends to do very well during periods of high inflation. Oil — the most heavily traded commodity globally — has soared 45% year to date. And the supply shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could keep that trend going. Strong oil prices benefit oil producers. Chevron’s latest quarterly earnings more than quadrupled year over year. The stock is up nearly 40% in 2022. The company returns cash to investors, too. Paying quarterly dividends of $1.42 per share, Chevron has an annual yield of 3.4%. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.

5/17/2022,"The Dow Jones index finished last week with a modest loss, even after a late-week rally in Friday’s session. It marked the seventh week in a row that the Dow posted a weekly loss, it’s longest such streak in two decades. That capped a brutal season of market losses, all across the board. The S&P 500 is down 16% this year, and the NASDAQ, with a year-to-date loss of 25%, is into bear market territory. Investors have been giving conflicting sets of reactions to the market’s fall. Coming at it from a bearish angle is Morgan Stanley’s strategist Michael Wilson, who writes, “We continue to believe that the US equity market is not priced for this slowdown in growth from current levels. We expect equity volatility to remain elevated over the next 12 months.” To cope with these market gyrations and increased volatility, Wilson recommends a hard shift into defensive stocks – and plenty of the Street’s analysts have been going that route, too. Using TipRanks' database, we’ve pulled up the latest info on two stocks that fit the bill. These are high-yield dividend payers, offering defensive investors yields of 8% or better. Each stock also holds a Strong Buy consensus rating; let’s see what makes them so attractive to Wall Street’s analysts. Ares Capital Corporation (ARCC) We'll start with a business development company (BDC), Ares Capital Corporation. These are specialty finance firms that work in parallel to the banking industry and provide access to capital, credit, and other financial instruments for small- and mid-market enterprises that would not necessarily have access to the major banks. Ares, which is based in New York City, makes it possible for small businesses, America’s traditional economic driver, to remain solvent. Ares maintains a highly diversified portfolio of enterprise investments, with its hands – and funds – in a wide range of assets classes, industries, and geographic locations. The company’s investment portfolio currently holds 395 companies, backed by over 200 private equity sponsors, and boasts a fair value of $19.5 billion. The 1Q22 results, however, were somewhat mixed. Net investment income came in at $198 million, or 41 cents per share, compared to $144 million, 33 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company reported a core EPS of 42 cents, roughly flat y/y from 1Q21’s 43 cents, and below analyst expectations of 47 cents. Despite the miss in the financial results, Ares declared a 42-cent per common share dividend for 2Q22. This adds to the already announced 3-cent special dividend, which is scheduled for payments through the end of this year. The regular dividend, of 42 cents, annualizes to $1.68 and yields a robust 8.75%. Add in the special payment, and the current yield rises to 9.37%. Covering the stock for J.P. Morgan's Melissa Wedel believes ARCC presents a compelling risk reward. The analyst writes, ""We believe the strength of ARCC’s origination platform, sizable balance sheet, access to capital markets, and ample liquidity position the company favorably. ARCC’s scale and industry relationships enable the BDC to continue to make competitive, high-credit-quality investments. We believe ARCC’s position as one of the largest BDC platforms affords an advantage in deploying capital opportunistically during market stress and securing funding. We believe ARCC’s solid capital and liquidity position as well as its position as one of the market leaders is not reflected in the share price, resulting in a compelling entry point for investors."" Based on all of the above factors, Wedel rates ARCC shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) and her $22 price target implies a 13% upside by year’s end. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~22% potential total return profile. (To watch Wedel’s track record, click here) JPM’s bullish stance on this stock is no outlier – the shares have 6 positive analyst reviews, for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. ARCC is priced at $19.51 and its $22.33 average price target suggests ~15% gain from that level over the next 12 months. (See ARCC stock forecast on TipRanks) Owl Rock Capital (ORCC) The second dividend stock we’ll look at is another BDS firm. Owl Rock also functions as a financing specialist in the mid-market enterprise niche, providing credit, loan facilities, and capital access for the small and medium enterprise sector. Owl Rock’s portfolio brings in approximately $658 million in annual revenues. The full portfolio includes 74% first lien senior secured debts, and 14.7% second lien senior secured debts. The company has investments in 157 companies which have an aggregate value of $12.8 billion. Owl Rock’s average investment in a portfolio company is $81.3 million. In the first quarter of this year, Owl Rock saw its investment income increase year-over-year from $221.6 million to $264.2 million, for a gain of 19%. Per share, net investment income came in at 31 cents. This was down from 35 cents in the year-ago quarter, and also missed the 33-cent forecast. However, the company’s earnings were sufficient to keep up the dividend. Owl Rock declared a dividend for Q2 of 31 cents, equal to the quarterly investment income. This marked the sixth quarter in a row with the dividend held at this level. Annualized, the payment comes to $1.24 and yields a robust 9.3%. That gives investors a full point above the April inflation rate, and ensures a true realized return. 5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers Owl Rock for JMP Securities, and takes a bullish stand on the firm. “We remain constructive on Owl Rock Capital despite the lighter quarter of net investment income generation and slight decline in book value/share. We were encouraged to see a 3rd consecutive quarter of covering the dividend with net investment income, particularly given the light quarter of repayment related fee income that had been a material component of results in 2H21 due to elevated activity levels in the back half of the year,"" Ryan opined. ""Additionally, management’s diligence in extending duration and building a cost-efficient, predominantly fixed-rate liability structure positions earnings to benefit from a rising rate environment. In short, we believe that Owl Rock should continue to deliver strong performance with a fully-scaled investment portfolio,” the analyst added. In line with these bullish comments, Ryan rates ORCC shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $16 price target indicates potential for ~19% upside in the months ahead. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here) Overall, Wall Street’s analysts have given these shares 6 recent reviews and they break down 5 to 1 in favor of Buys over Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus on the stock. ORCC is trading for $13.47 and its $15.46 average price target suggests it has ~15% one-year upside to look forward to.
