4/9/2022,"Our growing season is getting longer. It has increased by about 29 days since the 1960s. We have warmer beginnings and warmer endings – both spring and autumn are milder than half a century ago, but also more unpredictable because of climate change. Mid spring, particularly April, has in recent years been drier, with temperatures occasionally reaching the high 20s. This is a key month for sowing and planting out, but it can present challenges as we swing from wetter winters into sudden heat and drought, and back again – as June and July are often duller, wetter months. Your strength to weather this (pun intended) depends on your soil. The more organic matter you can incorporate into your soil through mulches and compost, the better it will be able to hold on to and let go of water, by the miraculous work of the soil food web community. Mulches on the surface will also insulate that precious top layer and slow down surface evaporation, further helping to protect the community below. I sieve the best of my homemade compost to mulch around young seedlings and plants. Use rougher compost to earth up potatoes or place around squashes and beans once they are thriving. If you don’t have home compost, you could use spent compost from last year’s pots, grass clippings (but make sure there’s no weed killer in it), straw or bark mulch. If it’s been dry for a week or more when sowing or planting out, you need to adjust how you go about things. This doesn’t mean delaying this work, but taking care to conserve water in the soil. If it’s unseasonably hot (22C or higher), don’t sow in the middle of the day as water will evaporate quickly; wait till early evening. Absorbing water is the first part of germination and if a seed can’t get enough water in the first few critical hours, it halts the process. If the soil is dry when sowing direct, water where you will sow first, wait until this has drained away, water again, then sow and cover the seeds with dry soil. The dry top layer will act like a mulch and slow down evaporation. Using the back of a small rake or hoe, draw back the top layer of soil to one side of where you will sow, then use this dry soil to cover your watered-in seeds. It is amazing how effective this method is. It also means that you can be very precise with where you water, which results with less surface weed and seeds getting a head start from a good drenching. It is the same principle for planting out; use a dry mulch after watering to conserve water. Finally, with anything that you’ve recently planted, if doesn’t rain hard, carry on watering. You have to keep this up till you see a new set of leaves, a sign that the plant’s roots are bedding down.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Spring is warmer than it used to be – time to adapt the way you garden,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/09/spring-is-warmer-than-it-used-to-be-time-to-adapt-the-way-you-garden
4/9/2022,"Imagine cruising down a 10-lane highway and knowing that, high above your head, a mountain lion is quietly going along its way. This remarkable image could soon be reality for drivers on one of California’s busiest roads, as the world’s largest wildlife overpass begins construction this month. The history-making project will comprise a green bridge built across the 101 highway near Los Angeles, creating a corridor between two parts of the Santa Monica mountains. Stretching 210ft long and 165ft wide, the overpass will allow safe passage for lizards, snakes, toads and mountain lions, with an acre of local plants on either side and vegetated sound walls to dampen light and noise for nocturnal animals as they slip across. The project, nearly a decade in the making, comes at a crucial time. Highways in this car-heavy landscape crisscross critical habitat for the protected mountain lions and other animals, forcing them to make what can be deadly crossings. At least 25 of the big cats have been killed on Los Angeles freeways since 2002. The latest death was just weeks ago, on 23 March, when a young lion was struck and killed on the Pacific Coast highway. Beth Pratt, an urban ecologist with the National Wildlife Federation, feels as if she is running the last mile of a marathon. Pratt has spent most of the last decade planning the project, persuading transportation officials of its importance, and bringing together stakeholders and donors to fund it. “I’m a little dizzy still, but I feel relieved: we have the chance to give these mountain lions a shot at a future.” A groundbreaking ceremony to mark the start of construction for the $90m crossing – called the Wallis Annenberg wildlife crossing – will take place on Earth Day, 22 April. Construction will mostly happen at night and the project isn’t expected to be complete until early 2025. The bridge’s price tag will be covered by about 60% private donations, with the rest coming from public funds set aside for conservation purposes. California’s Governor Gavin Newsom has called the project an “inspiring example” of public-private partnership. The project is breaking the mold in many ways: not only is it the largest crossing in the world, stretching over 10 lanes of one of the busiest roadways in the country, but it’s also an engineering marvel. The crossing is designed to seamlessly integrate into the mountains, offering big cats, coyotes, deer, lizards, snakes and other creatures a safe way to travel to different parts of open territory in the Santa Monica mountains recreation area – a 150,000-acre space. Robert Rock, a landscape architect with Living Futures in Chicago who led the design, says this nature-centered type of construction makes it unusual among other wildlife bridges and underpasses around the world, which are typically made of cement and steel. This one is designed to seamlessly glide into the environment on both sides – and send a message to the people driving below. His team includes a soil scientist – who collected samples nearby that are specific to the local trees – and a mycologist, who is studying the fungi of the area and how they can help the seamless flow of plants and animals across the overpass. Docents will be posted nearby to discourage people from exploring the overpass. (Pratt says that planting poison oak and posting signs about rattlesnakes are also effective tools to keep humans off the bridge.) Rock says he is optimistic that the investment could serve as a precedent for how design can play a restorative role in the natural world. “As both a tool for and a symbol of connection, it will stand as an alluring challenge to future generations to pick up the mantle of design to bridge the gaps elsewhere in our world,” he says. Approximately 300,000 cars pass through this area each day, and Pratt calls it an opportunity for millions of Angelenos to see how humans can live more harmoniously with nature. “Someone could be in rush-hour traffic, and there could be a mountain lion right above them,” she says. “I think that’s such a hopeful image, and one that inspires me that we can right some of these great wrongs.” Pratt says the plight of the region’s mountain lions caught the eye of donors from around the world. People sent money from London. A couple from Kansas who had visited the city only once donated $675,000. Leonardo DiCaprio’s foundation chipped in $300,000. Pratt points to the local celebrity mountain lion P22, whose exploits around the city have captured headlines, as a catalyst for it all. “People really took his plight to heart, and this is not just a California story: the world has come together around his cause.” P22 won’t actually be the intended user of this crossing, since he lives in a part of Los Angeles far east of the mountain range. But his symbol helped raise the money that will fund the bridge. And most of the area’s 100 mountain lions live in the area that the bridge will span. The scientists say there is a learning curve for animals, and they will slowly begin to explore the bridge. For wary creatures, it may take up to five years to use the crossing successfully. Cats will follow smaller prey species, who generally more quickly adapt to the new territory. “It’s not just a solution for P22 to get across the road, as much as P22 is the face of the campaign,” says Rock. “This is restoring a piece of lost habitat, putting it back across the mountains.” Wildlife crossings are picking up speed across the country, and the world. They make economic sense – most pay for themselves in a decade or two, and a study in Banff, Canada, whose national park has more than 40 wildlife underpasses and overpasses, found a 90% decrease in wildlife-vehicle collisions, which saved the park money. But it’s only recently that the wildlife science and infrastructure communities have come together to understand the problem deeply. Joe Biden’s $1.2tn infrastructure bill earmarked $350m for animal-friendly infrastructure like bridges, underpasses and roadside fences. Pratt says the project struggled to raise money in the early days of planning. Luckily the team was able to find some people who recognized the importanceof this project. But perhaps the bigger challenge was philosophical: naysayers told her the project shouldn’t or couldn’t be done – “that we shouldn’t waste money on saving mountain lions in an urban area, that we would never be able to raise the funds.” She was undeterred. “I wasn’t going to take no for an answer, not when a population of mountain lions was at stake.”",News/Environment,Animal crossing: world’s biggest wildlife bridge comes to California highway,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/09/wildlife-bridge-california-highway-mountain-lions
4/9/2022,"When the pandemic hit, Jools Sampson’s work dried up. Sampson, who is 53 and lives in north London, runs a business offering yoga and wellness retreats across the UK and overseas. One of her regular clients worked in an NHS intensive care department, so Sampson checked in with her to see how she was doing. It was April 2020. The woman said she was struggling. It got Sampson thinking. “I contacted all my team,” she recalls, “which is 12 people, and said, ‘I’m thinking about offering free retreats to NHS staff. Would you like to be involved?’ All of them said yes, straight away.” Sampson contacted her favourite venue, Tofte Manor in Bedfordshire, and its owner waived the hire fee. But Sampson still needed money to pay her staff’s expenses. She posted a fundraiser online and the donations began rolling in immediately. Next, to invite NHS staff. Sampson put out a call on social media and asked people to nominate friends and loved ones. Within days she had 400 nominations – for just 16 places. “Oh my God,” she says. “It was heartbreaking, reading through those stories.” In September 2020, the first cohort of NHS staff arrived at Tofte Manor. They were doctors and nurses who had worked predominantly in ICU or Covid wards. They were exhausted, traumatised and strung-out. “Many of them had gotten Covid,” Sampson says. “Some of them had long Covid. Others had lost colleagues. They’d been working without PPE, sleeping away from their families in caravans for six weeks, so as not to bring the virus home.” Sampson and her colleagues offered three home-cooked meals a day, with wine in the evenings. “This wasn’t a detox retreat,” Sampson jokes. They gave massages and facials and ran yoga and breathwork sessions. In the evenings, the team would host deep relaxation workshops, to help the staff sleep: many had developed insomnia. On the first day, the doctors and nurses spoke about practical stuff, medical treatments. By day two, they were speaking about their emotions. “They were able to reflect and support each other,” Sampson says. “All of them were either in deep shock, had PTSD or were completely burnt out.” Newly qualified nurses spoke about the horror of having to console struggling patients while their families watched via a video call. “Every single person on that retreat cried,” says Sampson, “it was so emotional. All we wanted was for the NHS staff to feel appreciated. We wanted to shower them with love.” “Jools has been like an angel, coming into stressed and distressed people’s lives, and giving them a chance to be thanked, supported, and cared for,” says massage therapist Lucie Ormerod, who volunteered her time on the retreat. Sampson organised two further retreats, in May and June last year. “People had been through so much. In the first wave of the pandemic they’d been heroes. A year on they were asking themselves, ‘Is there something else I can do with my life?’ Their mental health was really deteriorating.” She still has money left over from her fundraising efforts, and plans to run two more retreats later this year. It’s difficult to find a venue she can afford to hire, now that wedding bookings are resuming – plus she’s back to her pre-pandemic workload, so time is limited. Meanwhile, more nominations arrive in her inbox every day. “NHS staff are still utterly exhausted,” Sampson says. Even though it takes Sampson hundreds of hours to deliver the retreats, it doesn’t feel like work. “It’s given me faith that there are many good people in the world,” she says. “The last year and a half has been a really dark time for me personally and professionally, and to be around such special humans has given me a lot of faith. It’s a real honour to care for them.” At Sampson’s request, Aire Ancient Baths spa in London gifts her with a day of spa access and a sandalwood oil massage. She heads down on a Friday afternoon after a particularly busy month planning her new NHS retreats for later in the year. “I pottered about the hot pools and steam baths for ages,” she says of her spa day, “just thinking about my life over the last two years. Because I’ve spent time running these retreats for people who’ve been through hell and back, but in that time, I’ve not really given anything to myself.” She says it was an emotional experience. “I sat in those baths, and was so grateful. I thought, ‘Jools, you’ve worked hard for the last two years, and it’s been tough.’ It was a powerful moment of reflection, and giving myself a little pat on the back.” Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

4/9/2022,"Rishi Sunak and his family potentially avoided paying tens of millions of pounds in taxes through his wife’s “non-dom” status while the chancellor imposed tax rises on the public, Labour has said. The chancellor’s wife, Akshata Murty, gave in to mounting pressure on Friday, announcing she would pay UK taxes as Sunak’s position began to appear increasingly tenuous. Murty said she understood that many felt her tax arrangements were not “compatible with [her] husband’s job as chancellor”, adding that she appreciated the “British sense of fairness”. She will pay tax on all future worldwide income and for the last tax year, but not on backdated income. Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, accused Sunak of failing to be transparent about his family’s financial arrangements while raising taxes for millions during a deepening cost of living crisis. Haigh said that while it was “clear” the arrangement was legal, many Britons would be questioning the ethics involved. “The chancellor has not been transparent. He has come out on a number of occasions to try and muddy the waters around this and to obfuscate,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It is clear that was legal. I think the question many people will be asking is whether it was ethical and whether it was right that the chancellor of the exchequer, whilst piling on 15 separate tax rises to the British public, was benefiting from a tax scheme that allowed his household to pay significantly less to the tune of potentially tens of millions of pounds less.” The Guardian estimates that Murty has potentially avoided about £20m in tax because of her status, for which she currently pays £30,000 a year. Under non-dom rules, Murty did not legally have to pay tax in the UK on the estimated £11.5m in annual dividends she collects from her stake in Infosys, her billionaire father’s IT business. UK tax residents would be expected to pay about £4.5m in tax on the dividend payment. In a press conference on Friday, Boris Johnson admitted he had not been told about Murty’s non-dom status. But he denied anyone at No 10 was briefing against the Sunaks, and praised the chancellor for doing an “outstanding job”. Haigh’s remarks follow calls from Labour and the Lib Dems for an investigation into whether Sunak breached the ministerial code by failing to be transparent. Under pressure, the chancellor on Friday confirmed he had a US green card – meaning he had declared himself a “permanent US resident” for tax purposes for 19 months while he was chancellor and for six years as an MP. A source confirmed Murty also held a green card. This admission appears to weaken Sunak’s defence of his wife being a non-dom because she one day planned to return to live in India. Furthermore, despite bowing to pressure to pay UK tax on future income and for the last tax year, Murty will retain her non-dom status. This could in future allow her family to legally avoid paying inheritance tax. Amid these calls for further scrutiny of the chancellor’s tax arrangements and financial interests, Sunak was defended by Kevin Hollinrake, the Tory MP for Thirsk and Malton in North Yorkshire. Hollinrake denied allegations of Murty’s non-dom status being a “tax dodge”, arguing that Conservative and Labour governments had both used non-dom status in policy to attract wealthy people to the UK. Speaking on the Today programme, Hollinrake said: “This is not a tax dodge. It is a deliberate policy to attract wealthy people from other countries around the world to the UK on the basis that they create jobs and create wealth in the UK that benefits everybody.” The Guardian has learned that just days before Sunak raised national insurance contributions, affecting millions of people, the Treasury introduced a new low-tax scheme that is partly devised to benefit some wealthy non-dom investors. Hollinrake went on to defend Sunak for continuing to hold a green card and for paying taxes in the US even after he became chancellor, saying that he needed one when he was working there. He added that Sunak “then came to the UK and declared that position with the Cabinet Office”. “It doesn’t reduce his taxation in the UK at all. In fact with a green card you can often pay more tax,” he said.",News/Politics,Labour accuses Sunak family of avoiding tens of millions in taxes,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/09/rishi-sunak-akshata-murty-accused-avoiding-millions-taxes-labour
