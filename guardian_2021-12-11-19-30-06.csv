A special comment is due for Mr Manley’s self-referential first prize winner. Such opportunities come very rarely, and in this instance resulted in an irresistible clue.

12/11/2021,"Joe Root spoke of harsh lessons learned but remained unrepentant over England’s selection and strategy after a harrowing nine-wicket defeat at the Gabba that leaves his side needing to overcome 67 years of history in Australia. Only once before have England overcome a 1-0 deficit to win an away Ashes series – the 3-1 victory in 1954-55 when Frank Tyson terrorised the hosts – and thus a tour that has supposedly had two years of planning behind it already appears in jeopardy.  Bowled out for 297 on the fourth morning after a tepid collapse of eight for 77 in 30.1 overs, Root could only look on enviously as Australia knocked off a lowly target of 20 to hand Pat Cummins a victory in his first Test as captain. “There are harsh lessons that we’ve learned throughout this Test match,” admitted Root, having earlier fallen 11 runs short of his first Ashes century away from home. “Credit to Australia, they’ve taken every chance that’s come their way and I can’t say the same about ourselves.” Much went back to the first morning, when Root opted to bat at the toss despite cloud cover and grass on the pitch, only to see four wickets fall in the first hour and a lowly total of 147 result. The absence of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad for the first time in five years became a running theme, with the former not 100% ready after a sparse buildup and the latter overlooked in favour of the heavily punished spin of Jack Leach. “I think batting first was the right decision,” said Root, who suffered a first-innings duck. “Being 40 for four makes it look like that’s not the case. If we had got even 250 in that first innings and the game looks very different altogether. “In terms of selection, I wanted a balanced attack. I wanted to be able to change the momentum of the game and we went with the spinner. Credit to Australia, they took on Leachy. He had to bowl on that wicket at its worst and I was slightly too aggressive with his fields early on. It made it very difficult for him.” Ollie Robinson, Mark Wood and Chris Woakes held their own as the three frontline seamers chosen, even if Leach was pounded for 102 runs in 13 overs and Ben Stokes struggled with both overstepping and some physical strains on his return from a four-month absence. Anderson and Broad will push for recalls come the pink ball second Test in Adelaide, however, the veteran pair’s daily training sessions having been a regular feature of the TV coverage in Australia and the subject of much debate. Ultimately the result came down to the limp batting – something only briefly arrested when Root and Malan put on 162 the second innings – a dropped catch of David Warner halfway through his innings of 94 and two missed run out chances. “We’re in the series, we’ve not [much preparation] going into it, so we’ll be better for it.” Root said. Looking forward to the second Test beginning at 4am GMT on Thursday, he added: “We’ve got something to work on for guys who haven’t experienced Ashes cricket before, they know what’s coming now and the challenge they face. We have to be ready. Sometimes the game coming around straight away is what you need, to get back out there and put things right.” Though dominant for all but two of the nine-and-a-bit sessions, Australia did not emerge unscathed. Warner was unable to bat during the run chase after being struck in the ribs by a short ball from Stokes on day two, while Josh Hazlewood was restricted to six overs on the final day, that were down on pace, due to a possible side issue. Yet, with Travis Head’s 152 from No 5 vindicating his selection, Nathan Lyon ending a near year-long wait for his 400th Test wicket and Cummins beginning his captaincy with a five-wicket haul and seven victims in the match, the hosts are clearly in the ascendancy. Cummins said: “Someone was smiling over me. I’m really proud of everyone. I thought it was a really complete performance.” Meanwhile, Cricket Australia confirmed on Saturday that the fifth Test which begins on 14 January will now be a second day-night pink ball affair staged in Hobart, Tasmania, after West Australia’s hard border saw the fixture moved away from Perth last week.",Sport/Sport,Joe Root defends Ashes selection and strategy after England capitulate,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/11/joe-root-defends-ashes-selection-and-strategy-after-england-capitulate
12/11/2021,"Enes Kanter Freedom has had an intriguing basketball career. He was barred from playing college basketball at the University of Kentucky because he had received benefits from his time playing professional basketball in Turkey as a teenager. And since being drafted as the No 3 overall pick in the 2011 draft, he has played for five different NBA teams and is currently in his second spell with the Boston Celtics.  But it is off the court where Freedom has attracted the most attention. He has spoken out on human rights violations both in China and Turkey, where he grew up. His criticism of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, led to reprisals against his family and Freedom’s Turkish passport being cancelled. More recently, he has taken aim at LeBron James for his sponsorship deal with Nike and the company’s alleged ties to forced labor in China. Then last month, he became a US citizen and legally changed his name from Enes Kanter to Enes Kanter Freedom. Freedom’s political activity down the years went mostly unnoticed to most of America. If there was a reaction, it was generally one of support across the political spectrum. The right welcomed his attacks on one of their foes, Communist China, while liberals admired his fight against Erdoğan, a leader in the mold of Trump. That all changed when Freedom went on Fox News’s Tucker Carlson Tonight. He attacked players like LeBron, who have spoken about social issues in the United States. “I feel like they should just keep their mouth shut and stop criticizing the greatest nation in the world and they should focus on their freedoms and their human rights and democracy,” Kanter told Carlson, who no doubt was licking his lips along with his rightwing audience. The backlash was swift. In the Atlantic Jemele Hill wrote that “the subtext of Carlson’s question was obvious: Most NBA players are Black, and Carlson frequently portrays people of color who seek political and social change as ungrateful and unpatriotic.” In the Nation, Dave Zirin said that Carlson “looked like a rosy-cheeked, spoiled child under the Christmas tree. For him, having Enes attack powerful outspoken Black people must feel like getting the gift topping his list for Santa.” I understand the points Hill and Zirin made and agree with much of what they say. And while I’m aware of Maya Angelou’s quote that “when people show you who they are, believe them the first time”, I didn’t believe the Carlson interview was indicative of what Freedom really feels. Many on the left have begun to undermine the altruism of Freedom’s endeavors or ridicule his playing career (a tactic straight out of the right’s playbook when they disagree with an athlete). So I reached out to him to give him an opportunity to clarify his beliefs. We started off by talking about his statement on Carlson’s show that players should appreciate the freedoms they have in America compared to countries like China and Turkey and “stop criticizing the greatest nation in the world”. Was he effectively using a familiar trope of the right: that players like LeBron should shut up and dribble? “What I meant was, where I’m coming from, Turkey is a brutal dictatorship,” Freedom told me. “We have no freedom of speech, religion or expression. We have no democracy. Turkey could have been a branch of Islam in the west, but just because of all the stuff that’s happen ... it’s impossible. “So what I meant was, people should feel lucky and blessed to be in this situation [in America]. And obviously there are many issues in America. I’m definitely not denying it. I recognize many of them and racism is definitely at top of the list. But what I meant was at least, they’re not in a country like Turkey, Syria, North Korea, Venezuela or Belarus.” That, however, does not mean Freedom believes players in America should stay silent about problems in this country. “Obviously I stand for freedom and I would never, ever tell an athlete or not just an athlete, a human being or a celebrity to not use their platform. Because obviously the greatest thing we have is freedom of speech,” he said. Freedom did, however, fall into Carlson’s trap. The Fox News host was actually smiling as Freedom appeared to endorse Carlson’s view that anyone who criticizes America is an enemy of America. During our conversation Freedom acknowledged that his words had been twisted. “I saw some of the op-eds, and some of the interviews, and some of the comments and so many people didn’t understand what I was trying to say,” he said. “And I don’t judge them because obviously somebody used my words ... and some of the words that I used could be twisted or stretched. And I have to be more careful with my words.” Hopefully, this is a learning experience for Freedom and he won’t allow himself to be played by the likes of Fox News again. They do not care about human rights in China or Turkey. They are only out to use him as a pawn.

12/11/2021,"Isaac West was searching for a moment of authenticity. He had known Sudanese models Juor and Odur for a few years; both live in the US, as does he. Their brief was to portray a moment of tenderness between a couple. “You’re caring for your girlfriend by cutting her hair,” was West’s direction for Juor, who had the razor switched on. The Liberian photographer adds: “He messed up her hair a bit – he’s a model, not a barber! Luckily, Odur had a real appointment in the diary, so she didn’t mind.”  For the International Center of Photography exhibition Inward: Reflections on Interiority, West had been tasked with exploring the introspective using an iPhone. This shot was inspired by his new relationship with his girlfriend, Naima. Clearly a true romantic, he is also a fan of minimalism (“People try too hard to do too much,” he says) and vibrant colours (“I chose the yellow cloth because I wanted the dark skin to bounce off it”). “I love shooting dark-skinned models,” West says. “The secret is in the editing. Most people don’t know how to shoot or edit dark skin – they don’t get the tone right. I want to see contrast, rawness and richness. “People get in touch to say thank you.

12/11/2021,"Amanda Gorman, who became the youngest inauguration poet in US history when Joe Biden was sworn in as president, says she is attempting to “preserve the public memory of a pandemic” in a new collection published this week. Gorman shot into the public eye when she recited her poem The Hill We Climb at the inauguration in January, speaking of how “there is always light, if only we’re brave enough to see it, / If only we’re brave enough to be it.”  A selection of her early work was published by a small press in 2015, but this first major collection, Call Us What We Carry, which was published on Tuesday by Chatto & Windus in the UK, includes both Gorman’s inaugural poem and her response to Covid-19. In Fugue, she writes: “Every cough seemed catastrophe, / Every proximate person a potential peril”, capturing how “we fell heart-first into the news, / Head-first, dread-first …” Monomyth takes the form of a film script, laying out events in scenes, from December 2019, when “a new pneumonia-like illness is identified in Wuhan”, through the 20 January inauguration of Biden, when “Amanda Gorman, a skinny Black girl descended from slaves, becomes the youngest inaugural poet in US history”, to its ending. The 23-year-old told the Guardian that the collection was “my attempt to preserve the public memory of a pandemic”, because “nothing is as harrowing as the thought that the losses and lessons of this moment might be lost to collective amnesia”. She said: “I approach poetry as a method of social inquiry as well as a finding in itself, wherein we can both interrogate and rediscover our common humanity.” Many of the poems in the collection are written from a collective viewpoint. In At First, Gorman writes of how “When asking how others were faring, / We did not expect an honest or full response. / What words can answer how we’re remaining alive?” The poet said she had made a conscious decision use a collective voice. “When I began writing the collection, I would often start a sentence with ‘I’ and the thought would suddenly transition to ‘we’ and I realised that the ‘I’ from which I was writing from is actually a contingent of the ‘we’,” she said. “‘I’ is part of the ‘we’, not mitigated by it, which is why the book speaks with such a pluralistic voice. “I was discovering as I wrote that every pain and onus that I was writing about was owned, in part, by someone else as well. It wasn’t my own singularly, but it was a collective type of experience.” Don’t get us wrong.We do pound for what has passed,But more so all that we passed by—Unthanking, unknowing,When what we had was ours. There was another gap that choked us:The simple gift of farewell.Goodbye, by which we say to another—Thanks for offering your life into mine.By Goodbye, we truly mean:Let us be able to say hello again. This is edgeless doubt:Every cough seemed catastrophe,Every proximate person a potential peril.We mapped each sneeze & sniffle,Certain the virus we had run away fromWas now running through us. We slept the days down.We wept the year away,Frayed & afraid. Perhaps that is what it meansTo breathe & die in this flesh.Forgive us,For we have walkedThis before.

12/11/2021,"For 10 months in Kuwait, everything was upside down. Daytime was full of darkness from the thick smoke, and nights were bright from the distant glow of burning oilwells. When Iraq’s leader, Saddam Hussein, ordered the occupation of Kuwait in August 1990 in an attempt to gain control of the lucrative oil supply of the Middle East and pay off a huge debt accrued from Kuwait, he was fairly quickly forced into retreat by a US coalition which began an intensive bombing campaign.  But as Iraqi forces pulled out, in a final vengeful act they deliberately set more than 700 oilwells ablaze. Three decades later, despite promise after promise, Kuwait is still scarred by catastrophic damage from what is regarded by some as one of the world’s worst environmental catastrophes – and the billions set aside for remediation are still waiting to be spent. “The sound of gushing oil and roaring fires is still in my memory,” remembers Dr Samira Omar Asem, the principal research scientist at the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR). “I remember seeing a dead goat sinking in an oil lake.” The oilwells burned uncontrollably. The smoke plume above them initially stretched for 800 miles. A staggering 11m barrels of crude oil poured into the Persian Gulf, creating a slick nine miles long. Nearly 300 oil lakes formed on the surface of the desert, polluting the soils. An international coalition of firefighters battled the fires for months until the last well was finally capped on 6 November 1991 and Kuwait celebrated under clear skies. But today more than 90% of the unprotected contaminated soil remains exposed in the environment. Access to the contaminated sites is restricted, partly due to safety concerns arising from the littering of explosives left behind by Iraqi troops during their retreat. Photos from field research conducted between 2012 and 2019 show that the pollution takes all sorts of forms. Contamination in some wellheads currently runs as deep as four metres. Most of the damage was sustained within the Burgan oilfields in the southern deserts of Kuwait, an arid land 500 sq km wide housing more than 100 contaminated oil lakes. In one particularly badly affected oil lake known as Lake 105, images show meters-wide circles of black sludge. According to Meshari Almutairi, an environmental consultant with the Kuwait Oil Company, when he first visited the lake in 2015, he was able to shovel out the soil to expose a gradient of brown, as an indicator of pollution levels. Darker, more heavily contaminated soil at the top, fading into a healthy beige of undamaged soil near the bottom. He also saw huge pools of black oil deep enough to have drowned migratory birds falling into the oily grounds. Now, with increasing temperatures and weathering of the soil, the sludge has hardened and had become impenetrable. “When I tried to collect some samples recently, I needed to go to the edge and take out the surface, and I could not put my shovel in as I used to do before,” he said. “I tried two, three times, and couldn’t pick it up. It was like black ice.” Elsewhere in the northern oilfields of Raudhatain and Umm al-Aish, the source of Kuwait’s only two freshwater aquifers, visible crusts of dry oil lakes cover the tainted soil. Although Almutairi says that wind-blown sand has covered parts of the oil lakes in the north and south-east, multiplying its number over the years, harmful chemicals still remain in the soil today. “Had Kuwait decided to treat this contamination in 1993 or 1994, it would have been so easy. But after 30 years, you are not dealing with the crude oil that existed at that time,” he said. “It’s a very big challenge.” According to the KISR, just 2.3m cubic meters of the polluted sands – close to 10% – had been successfully removed as of June 2021 in a process known as remediation: roughly 1.7m cubic meters in the north, and 580,000 cubic meters in the south-east, where the Burgan oilfields lie. They estimate that another 19m cubic meters needing to be cleared. Researchers and conservationists are deeply concerned about the hazards it poses to the ecosystem and human health. “Any pollution in land or water should be treated as soon as possible,” said Asem. “The desert of Kuwait has valuable resources that need to be protected and preserved.” It’s the exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons, a mixture of chemicals found in crude oil, that is causing the biggest concern. Known as the most frequent type of environmental contaminant, any introduction of petroleum hydrocarbons to a pristine environment immediately results in reduced ecosystem functionality. They are already altering soil properties and causing extensive plant and animal mortality, and they’ve also seeped into fresh groundwater aquifers in northern Kuwait, used for irrigation, in small industries and within distilled water. Plant life has yet to recover around the contaminated sites, says Mohammed Mahmoud, director of the climate and water programme and a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. Their exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons damaged plant growth and seed germination. Their soil was also clogged by oil and prevented from accessing light, water and nutrients. “It’s a sort of byproduct of slanted priorities. People didn’t really buzz about this until they started to see plant life being impacted and physically seeing decay of the natural landscape,” he said. According to Green Line, an environmental NGO in Kuwait, the surrounding wildlife that lives and relies on the desert vegetation has been noticeably scarce over the years. “We know this is definitely one of the causes of the depletion of the wildlife stock here in Kuwait,” the group said. Although the ecosystem will eventually recover, says Sara Akbar, a chemical petroleum engineer and co-founder of Kuwait Energy, many species and areas are still fighting for their health 30 years later. And Kuwait’s people have suffered effects to their health, too. Akbar and Jeffery Hall, a US veteran who was enlisted during the Gulf war, are among many who experienced severe lung damage after breathing in the toxins from the smoke. “The doctor said it was as if I was smoking three packs of cigarettes every day for three years. Those were the kind of lungs I had,” said Akbar, who was the sole female firefighter dousing the oilwells. For Hall, who was exposed to the toxins for a week during his time in Kuwait, his diagnosis in 2017 with pulmonary sarcoidosis, a rare disease forming small lumps of inflammatory cells, is a damage that will last a lifetime. “It’s likely from the toxic exposure to oilwells and burn pits,” he said. “I now have no immune system.” These hazards, though recognised by the Kuwait government and international communities, have only slowly led to remediation efforts. The money is there. In 2005, The UN compensation commission awarded Kuwait with approximately $3bn (£2.2bn) to tackle the environmental damage caused. The largest portion of the funds, amounting to more than $2bn (£1.5bn), went towards the remediation of 114 sq km of damaged sites and efforts to conduct revegetation. But the delays have been incessant. After a series of delays from a prolonged tendering cycle, long bureaucratic procedures and last-minute cancellations, the Kuwait Oil Company, which is spearheading the work, awarded two tenders in 2020, with a third expected to be issued before the end of the year to remedy the oilfields focusing in the north and south-east of the country. The company says it plans to complete the remaining amount by 2024. But that timeline is greeted with disbelief by most people. “It’s a huge amount of soil,” said a representative of Green Line, who asked to remain anonymous. “The process by itself will take time and effort. Even if they were realistic about this timeline, there’s no way they’re going to make it.” Kuwait Oil Company was approached for comment but did not respond. Initial plans involved burying contaminated soil in landfills, with an aim to build more than a dozen more. But fears of intensifying the problem later on led Kuwait to consider proposals to use bioremediation, a process using microorganisms to naturally break down and decay hydrocarbons. “I think we are on track for complete clearance of all contaminated soil,” said Akbar. “But it took a long time with the bureaucracy. Finally, I think with these contracts we should be fine.” Others are not so optimistic, as bioremediation techniques are proving to be arduous and complicated. Recent field research is showing that due to the high presence of petroleum hydrocarbons and the concentration of salt content in Kuwait’s contaminated soil, bioremediation may not be effective. “The problem is how effective it will be, and even if it does work, it will probably take much longer because of the salinity of the soil that’s working to counteract the effectiveness of the microorganisms,” said Mahmoud. The swift response to recap the burning wells 30 years ago was regarded as a considerable achievement worldwide, but the efforts of postwar environmental restoration have yet to be seen. Iraq has paid out more than $50bn (£37.85bn) in reparations worldwide for losses incurred during the first Gulf War. An outstanding payment of $1.7bn (£1.3bn) remains for Kuwait. “Kuwait is working hard to restore the damage. However it will never go back to its pristine stage,” said Asem.",News/Environment,‘The sound of roaring fires is still in my memory’: 30 years on from Kuwait’s oil blazes,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/11/the-sound-of-roaring-fires-is-still-in-my-memory-30-years-on-from-kuwaits-oil-blazes
12/11/2021,"Ionce lived with a militant vegetarian who had grown up near an abattoir. With a thousand-yard stare, he’d talk about how its bloody runoff would seep into his local playground. He hadn’t touched meat since those days. You often hear this sort of thing from vegetarians and vegans: that if you looked at what went on inside (or even outside) a slaughterhouse, you’d switch to Quorn full-time. In a similar vein, if you want to quit smoking, I recommend watching someone go through lung cancer. I could never look someone in the eye and tell them smoking isn’t both immensely pleasurable and cool-looking. What I would say is this: my mum was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2017. Over just a few months I watched her shrivel, become obscured by tangles of medical tubing, and begin to suffocate to death as her lungs filled with fluid. She died that same year, and it was a relief to know that her unimaginable suffering was over. I apologise if this description has either put a damper on your next fag break, or stressed you into taking a fag break when you didn’t even have one planned. As a former smoker, I can understand either scenario.  But I quit smoking the moment my mum had her diagnosis. She’d never actually been a smoker, but I didn’t want to push my luck. Having seen lung cancer play out in front of me like a horror film, you’d think – perhaps – I’d support New Zealand’s ban on smoking for the next generation. Under these plans, those aged 14 and under in 2027 will never be able to buy tobacco products legally. The legal smoking age will increase with every year that passes – meaning that in 2073, someone who is 61 will be able to buy cigarettes whereas someone who is 60 will not. But, as the government ramps up anti-drug measures in the UK at the same time, you have to ask – when has criminalising a substance ever worked? When alcohol was banned in the United States, under prohibition, Americans wanted to carry on drinking. So they did. They just bought their alcohol from the likes of Al Capone, rather than legitimate, tax-paying businesses. And speaking of the US, I hear its war on drugs is still going brilliantly. Mass incarceration, predominantly of black men; brutal, militarised policing; and – to top it all off – a ton of drug addicts. In 2019, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, nearly 50,000 Americans died of an opioid overdose. Back to the Antipodes, though. It’s difficult for me not to stand by New Zealand giving the tobacco industry a much-needed kick in the balls. But criminalising tobacco is simply the wrong approach. If people want to smoke, they will, and they’ll buy their cigarettes from whoever happens to be offering them. And, for New Zealand’s Māori and Pasifika communities (who are statistically poorer than white Kiwis), rates of smoking are higher. In the runup to the all-out ban on smoking, New Zealand plans to reduce the amount of nicotine in cigarettes. This, in itself, is something opponents of the new measures have argued will simply force people to spend more money on more cigarettes to get the same hit. While I believe everyone should quit smoking (and am happy to dish out scare stories to anyone struggling to quit), I also believe that before banning substances that people use to self-medicate the unbearable shiteness of everyday life, you need to implement major life-improving social and economic change. Even in New Zealand, a country with a decent welfare state, rates of poverty (especially among people of colour) are rising. Since the pandemic, in fact, there’s been a 10% increase in child poverty. You can’t ban smoking without – first and foremost – creating a society where people no longer feel compelled to smoke. Just as you can’t ban drugs and expect people not to take them when life is so hard for some. Cigarettes – much like sugar and alcohol – should, I believe, be allowed to die out on their own, rather than be dealt a premature final blow. Makers of sweets and fizzy drinks are already starting to sell lower sugar versions of their products. There’s Cadbury’s “30% less sugar” Dairy Milk, and the (albeit much-complained about) reduced-sugar Irn Bru. What’s more, smoking is already losing popularity with young people. A survey by GlobalData this year found that – globally – 38% of people have never smoked, and – for Gen Z – 68% had never smoked. Zoomers, it seems, don’t want crow’s feet and yellow teeth in their TikToks – so just let them lead the way and they’ll apparently do all that’s needed to eradicate smoking. By all means, ramp up the terrifying public health campaigns. That British Heart Foundation ad from 2004, where fat is squeezed out of a smoker’s artery, still haunts my nightmares. Perhaps add to the library of graphic images on cigarette packs a picture of Nigel Farage sucking down those sweet, sweet carcinogens. But if stressed, bored and unhappy people feel the need to smoke, and you have nothing to offer up as an alternative, let them smoke.

12/11/2021,"“I’m still pinching myself that my dad, my own flesh and blood, had Ernie on one hand and Bert on the other,” Eli Attie says. “It is like he got to sit at Abbey Road studios and watch the Beatles record I Want to Hold Your Hand.” Attie’s father was the photographer David Attie who, in 1970, visited the set of Sesame Street in New York City during its first season. His images lay forgotten in a wardrobe for the next 50 years, until Eli recently discovered them. They are a glimpse behind the curtain of a cultural phenomenon waiting to happen. Here are not only Bert and Ernie but Kermit, Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch with his original orange fur (he was green by season two). And here are the people who brought these characters to life, chiefly Jim Henson and Frank Oz, the Lennon and McCartney of Muppetdom. What also stands out in Attie’s images are the children visiting the set. As in the show itself, they are clearly so beguiled by the puppets, they completely ignore the humans controlling them. Eli himself was one of those visitors, although he has no memory of it. “I was in diapers, and as the story goes, I was loud and not to be quieted down, and was yanked off the set,” he says. His parents and older brother Oliver at least made it into the photos. Oliver was even in an episode of the show, in the background in Hooper’s Store, Eli explains, with just a hint of jealousy.  Above: Bert and Ernie with puppeteers Daniel Seagren, Jim Henson and Frank Oz Left: Cast member Bob McGrath, an actor and musician, in a segment called The People in Your Neighborhood. Right: Henson (left) and Oz – the Lennon and McCartney of Muppetdom – operate puppets for a sketch titled Hunt for Happiness Fifty-two years and more than 4,500 episodes later, Sesame Street remains the premier address in children’s entertainment. It is still watched by hundreds of millions around the world, and broadcast in more than 140 countries. One attempt to statistically measure the show’s impact on American society failed because nobody could find a large enough sample group who hadn’t watched it. Sesame Street’s place in US culture was bizarrely underlined last month when Big Bird announced on Twitter: “I got the Covid-19 vaccine today! My wing is feeling a little sore, but it’ll give my body an extra protective boost that keeps me and others healthy.” He was promoting the rollout of vaccinations to five- to 11-year-olds, but Big Bird’s tweet, combined with Sesame Street’s recent introduction of a new Korean American muppet, has prompted a conservative backlash. Texas senator Ted Cruz responded: “Government propaganda … for your 5 year old!” Cruz later doubled down, tweeting a cartoon of the Sesame Street characters sitting around the Thanksgiving dinner table, with a dead, cooked Big Bird in place of a turkey. Others piled in. The influential Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) expressly banned Big Bird and other Sesame Street characters from its next conference, and CPAC organiser Matt Schlapp called for PBS, which broadcasts the show (although new episodes now air on HBO Max), to be defunded. “They just won’t stop in their push for woke politics,” he complained. Arizona state senator Wendy Rogers went even further, declaring: “Big Bird is a communist.” Beyond the optics of beating up on universally beloved children’s characters, in the context of David Attie’s images, these takes could hardly be more wrong. Attie had been commissioned to photograph Sesame Street by Amerika, a Russian-language magazine funded by the US state department and distributed in the Soviet Union. Essentially, it was a cold war propaganda project. Soviet officials would regularly return copies of Amerika to the US embassy unsold, saying their citizens were not interested. In truth, the magazine was so sought after, it became a black-market commodity, explains Eli Attie. “One embassy official said to me they had traded two copies of Amerika for these impossible-to-find ballet tickets in Moscow at the time,” he says. So Sesame Street was used as government propaganda, just not in the way Cruz and Rogers might imagine. The choice of a New York street scene was a radical move in children’s TV in the 60s. You could say that Sesame Street had a political mission from the outset, as the new documentary, Street Gang: How We Got to Sesame Street (to which Attie’s book is a companion piece), lays out. One of the show’s co-founders, the broadcaster Joan Ganz Cooney, was involved “intellectually and spiritually” with the civil rights movement. The other, psychologist Lloyd Morrisett, was concerned about a widening education gap in the 1960s US, which was leaving behind socioeconomically deprived children, particularly African Americans. These children were often spending long hours at home watching television while their parents were busy working. Instead of jingles for beer commercials, Cooney and Morrisett reasoned, why not use television to teach them literacy and numeracy? Above: Big Bird with actors Loretta Long and Matt Robinson, AKA husband and wife duo Susan and Gordon. Below: According to Big Bird’s operator Caroll Spinney, his ‘sometimes sad, very complex character’ gave the show its depth. With an $8m federal grant, the newly formed Children’s Television Workshop spent two years researching how to make content that would not only be educational but entertaining. That’s where The Muppet Workshop came in (even if the hippy-ish Henson was initially distrusted by his more academic colleagues). Not to mention the songs, the anarchic comedy sketches, the surreal animations, and the improvised child-with-muppet segments. The whole thing was an experiment. Nothing like it had been done before and there was no guarantee it would be a success, but everyone seemed to be on the same page. As Cooney puts it in the documentary: “We weren’t so worried about reaching middle-class children but we really, really wanted to reach inner-city kids badly. It was hardly worth doing if it didn’t reach them.” This explains why the show was set on an ordinary New York street – a radical move for children’s TV, a familiar place for the target audience. Equally radically, the show was multicultural and inclusive from the start, with white, Black and Latino actors alongside non-human characters of all colours. Even the title sequence and the guests reflected the US’s diversity (the first season featured James Earl Jones, BB King, Mahalia Jackson and Jackie Robinson). As the long-running writer and director Jon Stone said of the show’s inclusive approach: “We’ve never beaten that horse to death by talking about it; we simply show it.” Muppet designer and performer Caroly Wilcox goes to work with Henson. Sesame Street has taught kids about all manner of life topics. Not only racism (most recently with the introduction of two new African American characters, post-Black Lives Matter) but also poverty, addiction, autism, HIV and Aids, public health (Covid was not Big Bird’s first jab, he also got a measles vaccination in 1972), and gentrification (in 1994, the street was under threat of demolition from a loud-mouthed property tycoon named “Ronald Grump”, played by Joe Pesci). Sesame Street has even tackled the concept of death: when Will Lee, who played storekeeper Mr Hooper, died in 1982, the show featured a wrenching segment in which neighbours, clearly tearfully, explain to Big Bird that Mr Hooper is dead and is never coming back. Spinney, who played Big Bird for almost 50 years until his death in 2019, jokes with children on set. It wasn’t just “inner-city kids” Sesame Street was popular with. While his father was working, Eli Attie’s artist mother would also put him and his brother in front of the TV to watch it so she could paint. “There was a block of hours that it was on public broadcasting stations in the New York region. So she just thought: ‘Hallelujah. I can place them here, they’re entertained,’” he says. “We were learning to count, we were learning to spell and we were learning a kind of comedy: we both became fans of Monty Python and standup comedy and I’m sure this was the gateway.” Attie went on to become a TV writer and producer, working on shows such as The West Wing, House and Billions. Above: Filming on set of Sesame Street. Below: Henson with the Dentist and the Bus Driver from the song The People in Your Neighborhood, which was about different occupations. Sesame Street’s inclusive, humane, progressive agenda has always had its enemies. Mississippi broadcasters refused to air the first season back in 1969 on account of the show’s desegregated setting (they backed down after a few weeks). In the past decade, the conservative chorus of disapproval has been getting louder. Before Cruz and co, the show and PBS have been targeted by the likes of Mitt Romney, Fox News, and, inevitably, Donald Trump. “Sesame has never been a political show; it has been a very socially relevant show,” says Trevor Crafts, producer of the Street Gang documentary. Although the political climate today has echoes of the 1960s, when Sesame Street was created, he feels. “It was a very similar time. There was a lot of social unrest, and here we are again. It just shows that you need something like Sesame Street to sort of increase the volume of good in the world. And also to know that through creativity, you can make change. Positive change can occur if you’re willing to see a problem and try to fix it and do it creatively.” Spinney with Oscar the Grouch. Henson had wanted Oscar to be magenta, but television cameras couldn’t process the shade. In season two, Oscar became green. Long gets a peek into Oscar’s trashcan. Now in her 80s, she went on to be one of the longest-serving members of the original cast. Where some might see a political agenda, many more would simply see a model for the kind of society the US would like to be. “I think it showed everybody: ‘This is who we should be in our hearts,’” Eli Attie says. “It was utopian. It was optimistic, it was challenging and smart. And it didn’t talk down to children.” As well as a family album, his father’s photos capture that spirit of playful idealism. “I see now that’s part of who I am,” he says. “And it’s part of who we all are.”  The Unseen Photos of Street Gang: How We Got to Sesame Street by Trevor Crafts, with photographs by David Attie, is published by Abrams on 23 December at £28.99.

12/11/2021,"Labour has called on the government to give a “Christmas vaccine guarantee” to the hundreds of thousands of eligible children in England who have been unable to receive a Covid vaccination. With recent figures showing that just 44% of children in the 12-15 age group had been vaccinated on 8 December, Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said the government needed to make a bigger push to vaccinate the remainder before they returned to school in the new year.  “As Omicron cases in the UK are rising, it’s essential that ministers use the Christmas holidays to get the vaccine out to children, preventing continued chaos next term,” Phillipson said. “Labour has been calling on ministers to use pop-up and walk-in clinics, and bring back volunteers and retired clinicians to increase vaccine rollout, but 13 weeks after the jab was approved [by the chief medical officers] the Conservatives have failed to deliver. “With hundreds of thousands of children out of school each week this term, the government must urgently get a grip and stop neglecting children’s education.” The government had initially aimed to offer vaccinations to all 12- to 15-year-olds by the October half-term break. But the most recent figures suggest it will struggle to vaccinate half by the end of term next week. The Department of Health and Social Care has described the vaccination programme in England as “a phenomenal success”, with children able to be vaccinated at school or using the national booking system. Phillipson’s call came as two primary schools in England reported cases of the Omicron variant, including among staff and pupils at Solent infant school in Portsmouth. An entire year group at Manor community primary school near Dartford in Kent was sent home after a case emerged there. Phillipson has written to Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, asking him to urge the Department for Health to drive up vaccination rates among children, including a campaign to promote vaccinations and access to walk-in clinics. Earlier this week, Susan Acland-Hood, the permanent secretary at the Department for Education (DfE), suggested to MPs that most schools would have to pay for any new air conditioning or ventilation from their existing budgets. “In Germany and New York, ventilation systems have been in place in schools for months. Once again, England is lagging behind our international counterparts and children are being let down as a result,” Phillipson wrote. But even before the Omicron variant began spreading in England, attendance data from the DfE showed that more than 200,000 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of November, a rise of 60% in two weeks. Results collated by Education Datalab suggest that the absence rate in state secondary schools is close to 10%, compared with nearly 6% before the pandemic. The biggest contributor to the rise has been in number of pupils off school because of illness. The DfE counts pupils absent for “Covid-related” reasons if they have suspected symptoms or a positive lateral flow test result. But if they return a positive PCR test they are counted as absent because of illness. As a result, the figures understate the full impact of Covid on school attendance.",News/Education,Labour demands ‘Christmas vaccine guarantee’ for pupils in England,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/11/labour-demands-christmas-vaccine-guarantee-for-pupils-in-england
12/11/2021,"Perched 550 metres above sea level in the Swiss resort village of Arosa is a three-bedroom ski chalet that proves that a small space can feel expansive – and that, sometimes, a dated interior doesn’t need ripping out. Built in the 1970s, the house was bought by its owner, Zurich-based interior designer Claudia Silberschmidt, in 2016. It hadn’t changed in that time, and was filled with 70s fittings and furniture, including wall-to-wall beige carpets, dark orange tiles in the living space, and a striking wood-panelled suspended ceiling. She and her husband spent their visits that winter soaking up the chalet’s dated ambience while deciding how they might transform it.  “We wanted to adopt its 70s spirit and not force a wooden ‘mountain chic’ look on to it,” she says. “To freshen it up without erasing its identity, which had been what attracted us in the first place.” Silberschmidt has a long family connection to Arosa: her great-grandfather was the architect of a prominent local hotel; her grandfather was the hotelier there; and her father was born and brought up in the village. Silberschmidt visited the chalet as a child, and recalls feeling at home there, even then. “It’s not a real beauty, but it’s the perfect size and location,” she says. A tiny galley kitchen with black resin worktops was originally separated from the living and dining area by a wall; Silberschmidt removed it to create an open, communal kitchen, living and dining room. She designed a table made from natural spruce (inspired by a stack of freshly milled timber), which wraps around a supporting column and doubles as a kitchen worktop. Its far end resembles a stack of Jenga bricks. This, together with a built-in L-shaped bench upholstered in orange/pale pink fabric – a nod to 70s-style booth seating – divides the kitchen from the rest of the space. “I wanted a simple ‘no design’ table,” says Silberschmidt. She constructed it from pale, new wood, which contrasts with the dark grey walls and ceiling. She kept the decorative ceiling panel, painting it the same grey as the walls but adding blue highlights to create a retro-style feature. This is suspended over the dining and living area, marking it out from the kitchen space. Grey, blue and red tones fill the living area: the sofa is upholstered in the same grey fabric (from Andrew Martin) as the curtains. An open fire with a mantel above it and a wide shelf in front, along with an original decorative plaster surround, is painted the same colour as the walls; and the previously orange tiles are painted grey. A series of mismatched stools and chairs, including a fluffy blue love seat (for similar, try roselandfurniture.com) and stools surround a coffee table by British artist Paul Kelley: it’s made from copper cubes and resembles a Rubik’s Cube. The rug was designed by Silberschmidt (from frohsinn.ch), and pops of colour come from a vase and a 1960s ceramic lamp made in the former West Germany. A lot of people are afraid of using dark colours in a small space, says Silberschmidt, but if you combine it with “bright, happy details”, it can actually make the space feel larger. “When you paint the walls the same colour as the ceiling, the contours disappear,” she says. “The darker these colours, the stronger this effect will get, and the ceiling and walls will ‘fade away’. Painting all items (including fireplace and built-in cupboards) in the same colours and not having hard contrasts will make you feel the space is larger. Keeping the colour scheme neutral also means that, if I want a change, I can just switch the decorative elements, like the table lamp, carpet or cushions, and not have to repaint the whole house.” A floor-to-ceiling wall of black shelving spans the kitchen and living areas, displaying crockery, cooking pots and books. The highest shelves under the gabled eaves are accessed by a bespoke ladder. Copper features throughout, from a floor panel beneath the fire to stools in the living area, wall lights in the kitchen, utensils, and even an original milk churn on the landing. Another major job was changing the outdated 70s windows for higher-performance ones. Silberschmidt kept their arched shape, but opted for darker frames to better highlight the landscape outside. “It’s an inviting place,” says Silberschmidt. “I love the simple act of making a fire – the smell of it. It’s perfect for recharging the life batteries.”atelierzuerich.ch",Lifestyle/Life and style,Magic mountain – design tips on saving space in an Alpine retreat,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/11/space-saving-design-tips-from-a-swiss-alps-ski-chalet
