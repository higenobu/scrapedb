4/13/2022,"Health authorities have issued an urgent warning to Victorians not to eat wild mushrooms, with two poisonous varieties currently detected growing across the state. The deputy chief officer for Victoria, Angie Bone, issued a health advisory on Wednesday warning death cap and yellow-staining mushroom varieties were currently growing wild in large numbers. She said eating just one death cap mushroom could kill an adult. The Victorian health department advice comes just over a month after a similar warning was issued in the Australian Capital Territory, when a child was hospitalised after ingesting a death cap mushroom. Three others were also hospitalised in the capital in November 2021 after eating wild mushrooms. Warnings were also issued in New South Wales after mushrooms sprouted across parks and back yards after the wettest summer in three decades in parts of the state. The NSW Poisons Information Centre said it had received 73 calls about mushroom exposures in the first three months of 2022. Of the calls, 16 were the result of adults deliberately eating mushrooms. Another 45 were accidental exposures, 80% of which were in children under five. In May 2020, a Victorian man aged in his 70s died in hospital after consuming deadly mushrooms, while two people died in Canberra in 2012 after eating them at a party on New Year’s Eve. Symptoms of poisoning can include diarrhoea, nausea, violent stomach pains and vomiting. Even if symptoms subside, serious liver damage may have occurred that may result in death if not treated. Yellow-staining mushrooms, meanwhile, can cause diarrhoea, severe nausea, stomach cramps and vomiting. The severity of symptoms varies with the amount eaten. Poisoning for either variety generally occur six to 24 hours after ingestion. Death cap mushrooms grow under oak trees. The caps are 40-160mm in diameter and range in colour from pale yellow-green to olive brown, with the ridges on the underside of the cap coloured white. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Yellow-staining mushrooms look very similar to regular mushrooms or “cultivated mushrooms” and to edible wild mushrooms such as the field mushroom, but are much more common in urban areas. It can grow in large troops in lawns and gardens. Bone said cooking, peeling or drying the mushrooms would not make the poison inactive. She recommended only buying mushrooms from the supermarket or greengrocer. If people believe they have eaten a death cap or yellow-staining mushroom, they should urgently attend an emergency department. They should also take any remaining mushroom to the hospital for identification. Pets could also develop a range of illness from eating wild mushrooms, including gastroenteritis-type syndromes to severe life-threatening disease and death, with dogs more likely than cats to eat them. Its recommended pet owners take particular care while their animals are in areas where mushrooms may grow, and remove any mushrooms from their yard before they have a chance to eat them. Gloves should be worn when removing and disposing wild mushrooms.",News/Australia news,Victoria issues urgent health warning against eating death cap and yellow-staining mushrooms,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/13/victoria-issues-urgent-health-warning-against-eating-death-cap-and-yellow-staining-mushrooms
4/13/2022,"Scott Morrison has backpedalled after flagging the Coalition might support a bill banning transgender women from playing women’s sport following a backlash from Liberal moderates and independents. Morrison said on Wednesday the Coalition “does not have any plans” for Liberal senator Claire Chandler’s private bill to become a government one. The change of tack came as the government was forced into damage control over offensive social media posts about trans issues by Morrison’s hand-picked candidate for Warringah, Katherine Deves. Morrison said on Wednesday he was unaware of the history of offensive comments by Deves including her labelling of trans kids as “surgically mutilated”. Her opponent, independent MP Zali Steggall, seized on the comments and called for Deve’s disendorsement. On Monday, Morrison had said Chandler was “outspoken and brave on these issues” and he would “have more to say about that at another time” – widely interpreted as a sign the government could back the bill. Morrison praised Deves saying “she raises very important issues” and he added: “I share their views.” Senior ministers Simon Birmingham and Anne Ruston have declined to back the Chandler bill, while Liberal senator Andrew Bragg said it was unnecessary and MP Bridget Archer reiterated her view the proposal was a “vanity bill” that was not government policy. On Wednesday, news.com.au revealed Deves had apologised for social media posts she has since deleted in which she described trans kids as “surgically mutilated and sterilised” in a tweet with a photograph of a teenager who had undergone top surgery. Morrison subsequently said Deves had “apologised and withdrawn” her earlier social media comments which included that she was “triggered” by the rainbow pride flag. “I get triggered by it,” Deves had said. “Whenever I see it on social media I think ‘What now? What are they demanding now?’ And I grew up with gay relatives and siblings and hung out in Surry Hills and X in Sydney in the 1990s. Lots of LGB family and friends, their movement has been destroyed.” Deves has said she stood by her “desire to ensure we protect the safety of women and girls and our entire community”. “However, the language I used was not acceptable, and for that I apologise,” she said on Wednesday. Steggall said the fact Deves deleted her social media accounts “shows that she knew just how toxic, ill-informed and offensive her comments and views were”. “Her appalling and divisive comments were well known before the prime minister selected her, which begs the question – what did he already know?” the sitting member said. “He either knew her views and selected her anyway, or he wasn’t properly informed and made a flawed decision.” Steggall called on Morrison to reverse his “appalling captain’s call” and disendorse Deves. Asked about his earlier praise of Deves’ advocacy, Morrison said on Wednesday he was not aware of the views expressed in social media posts. “I was referring to the bill that is being brought forward by senator Chandler,” he said. Morrison told 2GB Radio on Monday that Deves was “standing up for something really important, and that is to ensure that, you know, when it comes to girls playing sport and women playing sport, that they’re playing against people of the same sex”. “It is a private members bill,” Morrison said on Wednesday. “The government does not have any plans for that to be a government bill. It’s a private members bill, and I have told you very clearly what my views on that bill are, so I have been upfront.” Despite Morrison’s personal approval, if Chandler’s bill is not backed by the government it is likely to fail, as Liberal moderates including in the ministry will be free to vote it down in the Senate and lower house. Jackie Turner, trans campaigner at Equality Australia, said Deves’ “comments about transgender people and our families are an example of the dehumanising abuse that trans people, and the broader LGBTIQ+ community, encounter every day”. “The candidate may have apologised for the language she used, but the kind of misinformation she has perpetuated results in the extreme levels of marginalisation of trans people, and some of the worst mental health outcomes in the community,” Turner said. “We call on all parties and candidates to treat trans and gender diverse people with dignity and respect.” On Wednesday, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said Morrison’s earlier support for the bill was about “an attempt to start up a devastating culture war that has the potential to claim lives”. “When conservatives are behind in the polls, they punch down,” Bandt told reporters at the National Press Club. “I will not be joining the prime minister in trying to prosecute a culture war when lives are at stake. Among transgender children, nearly half of them have reported attempted suicide … trans rights are non-negotiable for the Greens.” Teddy Cook, the vice-president of the Australian Professional Association for Trans Health, wrote in February: “Just like everyone in this country, we deserve protection under the law. Please don’t forget that trans people are not an ideology; we are real, and we are someone you know.”",News/Australia news,Morrison abandons support for trans sport ban after hand-picked candidate apologises for tweets,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/13/scott-morrison-abandons-support-for-trans-sport-ban-after-hand-picked-candidate-katherine-deves-apologises-for-tweets
4/13/2022,"There’s a dreamy moment halfway through Geoffroy Delorme’s brief, sensuous book in which one of the young deer he gets to know curls up beside him, its head resting on his leg. The image is both touchingly familiar and surreal. A couple of walkers nod in greeting as they pass, as if it’s customary for a wild deer to snooze in the lap of a human. No doubt, Delorme notes, they mistake the deer for a dog. Even more startling, the little deer, whom Delorme names Daguet, begins to twitch and wriggle. “He is clearly dreaming,” Delorme writes. Of what, one wonders, do roe deer dream? Deer Man follows the story of someone who turns his back on society and spends seven years living in a forest among roe deer. We discover very little about the events that preceded this decision. Exclusively home-schooled, the young man was clearly lonely. And there’s something amiss in his relationship with his family. Yet a fleeting encounter with a young buck draws him into the woods around Louviers, France, and off he goes. It’s fairytale stuff, both in its transformational force and its unspoken darkness. The lack of information about his life – the ruthless absence of autobiography – can seem odd to a modern reader. Yet the strength of this book is its singular focus on the deer. As readers, we yearn to know the nitty-gritty of how he made it in the wild. In his time there, he must survive the damp and cold and feed himself from the forest plants, differentiating the textures of leaves to forage in the dark. But we are spared the true privations he must have endured: Delorme is both stoical and tight-lipped. We are only glancingly told that he survived hypothermia on several occasions, that he learned to sit with one leg tucked under him to keep the water from impregnating his clothes, that he wore three woollen jumpers. Delorme never dwells on himself, stubbornly training the lens on the animals alongside him. Yet that is the power and charm of his book. There’s a long tradition of accounts by people who have tried to enter the domain of wild animals. The Peregrine by JA Baker remains one of the finest and strangest. More recently, we have Helen Macdonald’s H Is for Hawk. In Sooyong Park’s The Great Soul of Siberia, scientific scrutiny gives way to revelation in the face of his study subject, the Siberian tiger. Charles Foster’s Being a Beast saw him live like a range of creatures, from otters and swifts, in a tragicomical rejoinder to the challenge thrown out by philosophers: “What is it like to be …” Such books are encounters, more than anything else, with sentience. And yet we always somehow loop back to the human. The celebrated naturalist Richard Mabey has long railed against the impulse to use other animals as “some kind of mirror”. Writing against recent trends in publishing, Mabey challenges us to “have more respect for nature’s own narratives”. Many, like Foster, who try to do this acknowledge that we need a disruption of power relations across the living world. Yet, in most books, the hook must always be human biography. That is not what readers get in Deer Man, with its hallucinogenic brevity. Admittedly, there were times when I found his distance frustrating. Too often he skates over what must be fascinating territory for a reader. Opportunities for development are lost throughout the book. Yet one suspects this is the only kind of testimony that could come from someone who has, in many ways, eschewed the human world. That is the price. By the end, I took pleasure in how the tight, spare writing conveys the inadequacy of language to properly render the experience of living in the wild. As the chapters unfold, Delorme recedes even further from the narrative, mirroring his gradual withdrawal from civilisation and home. At first, he returns a few times a month to shower and recharge his batteries (Delorme is a photographer, and his images hugely amplify the text). But, over time, he returns less and less. And he takes less each time from his old life as his skills and confidence – and indeed appetite – begin to transform. Eventually, he no longer lives “in” the forest but “of” the forest. He uses “we” freely, not only to tell us what he and the deer are doing but in ways suggestive of emotional and psychic entanglement. What the whole book recognises is the agency of the animals Delorme meets. Sure, he has sought out a relationship with this wild creature. But so, too, has the animal. And this isn’t inevitable, as he points out. He tries the same with some foxes. They won’t tolerate him. What we are left with is a startling portrait of an animal that is both familiar to us and yet shockingly misunderstood. Roe deer – Capreolus capreolus – have been around since Homo sapiens emerged as a distinct species. In the UK, we’ve lived alongside them since at least the last ice age. We’ve worn them, eaten them, revered them, and etched early texts on their antlers. Today, we know them best on the bumpers of our cars and on our plates. The story is much the same in Delorme’s native France. Yet, for Delorme, each deer is unique. Each, for him, has a name and a personality. Unsurprisingly, then, Delorme returns from the woods an advocate. He wants the deer – and not us with our rifles – to be responsible for their own management. And he wants us to consider our forests and woodlands in radically new ways that recognise the meaningful lives of the species within them. Some readers may consider him mad. And, while I won’t give away the ending, we all know that Delorme is not, after all, a roe deer. It’s clear from the outset that this can’t go on for ever. Yet it is a delightful, moving read – and a quietly revolutionary one.  Melanie Challenger is the author of How to Be Animal: What It Means to Be Human.

4/13/2022,"Rupert Murdoch’s Australian lieutenant has told News Corp journalists there is “no one News Corp view” about the election and that individual editors are free to decide which party to endorse. Executive chairman of News Corp Australasia, Michael Miller, said it was important to remember that “electorate issues in Surry Hills differ greatly to those in Broken Hill” and that audiences “expect us to interrogate all parties and all sides”. “Firstly, there is no ONE News Corp view, and I purposely avoid expressing views at election time so there is no confusion between individual mastheads and columnist views, and any corporate position,” Miller said in an all-staff election memo sent on Friday. Historically, newspapers will editorialise on the eve of an election to give readers the view of the editor-in-chief on which party would be best to lead the country. The editorial view is not supposed to influence a masthead’s coverage of the news. News Corp has not endorsed Labor for more than a decade at the state or federal level, with the one notable exception of the crocodile-obsessed NT News, which backed Labor in 2019. All the company’s papers endorsed Scott Morrison for prime minister, and their coverage during the election campaign was hostile to then opposition leader Bill Shorten. If you go back 15 years to 2007, the Australian newspaper endorsed Labor leader Kevin Rudd for prime minister, but it is highly unusual for News Corp, which dominates the Australian newspaper market, to back a Labor government. Veteran journalist Malcolm Farr has covered every election since 1993 and is analysing this year’s coverage for the Judith Neilson Institute. The former Daily Telegraph and news.com.au political editor said Miller’s memo will encourage even closer monitoring of the way the News Corp papers cover the election. “That’s going to be interesting to watch,” Farr told Guardian Australia. “Because the nature of the Australian and the News Corp tabloids is to support a strong prime minister. And that’s been a consistency for close to 30 years, as John Howard would tell you, but also as Paul Keating could tell you. If I remember correctly, the Daily Telegraph was partial to him in the showdown with John Hewson.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Albanese’s gaffe on the first day of the campaign, when he couldn’t state the national unemployment figure or the official cash rate, gave News plenty of ammunition, and was seized on by non-News Corp media too. Farr says Miller’s memo appears to contradict the coverage of the gaffe in two of his papers. “The Australian and the Daily Telegraph seem to have a very similar headline,” Farr said. “‘It’s not Albanese-easy’ or whatever it was. There seems to be some conformity there, but that might have just been coincidence.” The Murdoch papers have repeatedly suggested that Albanese is unknown to the electorate and that he is more of a left-wing radical than he is claiming to be, with headlines “Unknown Albanese” in the Australian and “great unknown Anthony Albanese” in the Herald Sun. 🗞 Today's Front Page. Read the Mercury's digital edition, an exact copy of how the paper was printed: https://t.co/qp2cZxCv6T pic.twitter.com/Rlo7Bdqf99 The Australian’s investigations editor and writer Sharri Markson reached back 37 years in an attempt to find skeletons in the opposition leader’s past. Although he is an economics graduate from the University of Sydney, the Australian accused him of trying to “inflate his status as an ‘economics adviser’”. Miller said News Corp’s mastheads and its journalism should put the needs of individual communities first. “What matters in Ipswich is different to what matters in Ingleburn. The challenges for Tasmanians vary to those of Territorians. “It is customary for editors to endorse a candidate in the lead-up to an election,” he said. “It is the responsibility of each editor to present what, considering all the information available, they conclude is best for their masthead’s audience.” Albanese has tried to ­inflate his status as an economics adviser to the legendary Hawke govt in a bid to pump up his damaged economic credentials but was in fact a research officer to an out-of-cabinet minister and opposed the major ­reforms of the time.https://t.co/vHP3TZnJqR In 2019, Guardian Australia endorsed Labor because of the climate emergency and in 2016 Guardian Australia did not express a view.",News/Media,"There is ‘no one News Corp view’ on election, head of company’s Australian arm tells staff",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/13/there-is-no-one-news-corp-view-on-election-head-of-companys-australian-arm-tells-staff
4/13/2022,"The United Nations’ refugee agency has called on the UK government to intervene to stop single British men from being matched up with lone Ukrainian women seeking refuge from war because of fears of sexual exploitation. In the wake of claims that predatory men are using the Homes for Ukraine scheme to target the vulnerable, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told the Guardian “a more appropriate matching process” could be put in place to ensure women and women with children are matched with families or couples. The suggestion from the global refugee agency follows reports that Ukrainian refugees, predominantly women and sometimes accompanied by children, are at risk in the UK of sexual exploitation. Under the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme, British hosts must link up with Ukrainian refugees themselves, leaving tens of thousands of people to resort to unregulated social media groups to connect. A government-backed matching service run by the Reset charity offers to match UK hosts with refugees but has been operating for only just over a week. Those who want to move to the UK must have a sponsor before applying for a visa. In a statement, the UNHCR said there was a need for adequate safeguards and vetting measures to be in place against exploitation, as well as adequate support for sponsors. “[The] UNHCR believes that a more appropriate matching process could be put in place by ensuring that women and women with children are matched with families or couples, rather than with single men. “Matching done without the appropriate oversight may lead to increasing the risks women may face, in addition to the trauma of displacement, family separation and violence already experienced,” a spokesperson said. Leading refugee charities raised their concerns about the Homes for Ukraine scheme in a letter to Michael Gove, the minister in charge of the scheme. Louise Calvey, the head of safeguarding at charity Refugee Action, told the Observer it was at risk of being “Tinder for sex traffickers”. One 32-year-old woman from Bakhmut, Ukraine, who has been searching for an appropriate person to match in the UK, wrote that she had received suggestive messages from men on Facebook’s Messenger app. “I was approached by one older guy from London who said that I would have to share a bedroom with him, and was asked if I was okay with that,” she said in an email seen by the Guardian. The Sunday Times reported this week that a journalist posing as a 22-year-old Ukrainian woman from Kyiv found that within minutes of posting a message on the largest Facebook group for UK hosts she was inundated with inappropriate messages. Some men lied about having several bedrooms in their one-bed homes while another proposed sharing a bed, writing: “I have a large bed. We could sleep together.” Another sent a voice note that said: “I am ready to help you and maybe you can help me also.” In its statement, the UNHCR also raised concerns about the repercussions should the original UK host prove a potential threat to the safety of the refugee, and the six-month time minimum duration on the Homes for Ukraine scheme. “UNHCR believes that appropriate training and information are needed to ensure that hosts make an informed decision when applying to become sponsors. Housing a stranger in an extra bedroom for an extended period is not, for some people, sustainable,” the spokesperson said. There is growing public anger over the length of time that Ukrainians are being forced to wait before being given visas from the Home Office amid the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war. Priti Patel, the home secretary, apologised on Friday for the time it has taken for Ukrainian refugees to arrive in the UK under two visa schemes, after figures showed only 12,000 have so far reached Britain. Reports on Tuesday claimed that Gove had been accused of bullying Home Office officials by Patel’s permanent secretary, Matthew Rycroft. Asked to respond to the UNHCR’s request for a government intervention on sexual exploitation of Ukrainian women, a government spokesperson said: “Attempts to exploit vulnerable people are truly despicable – this is why we have designed our Homes for Ukraine scheme to have specific safeguards in place, including robust security and background checks on all sponsors, both by the Home Office and local authorities. “Councils must make at least one in-person visit to a sponsors property and following guests arrival, they have a duty to ensure the guest is safe and well. “We have also partnered with the charity Reset Communities and Refugees to fund and provide a matching service for sponsors and refugees to ensure that matches made are suitable, safe and successful. This service will vet eligibility, assess needs, and provide training for sponsors to ensure they can support the people they host.” Asked to confirm or deny whether there had been a complaint that Gove had bullied staff, the spokesperson added: “Humanitarian schemes set up in record time by the Home Office and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities working closely together are helping thousands of Ukrainians find safety in the UK.”",News/World news,"Stop matching lone female Ukraine refugees with single men, UK told",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/stop-matching-lone-female-ukraine-refugees-with-single-men-uk-told
4/13/2022,"Tesco doubled pre-tax profits to more than £2bn last year but has warned on profits for this year as it faces a battle to “keep the cost of the weekly shop in check” amid soaring inflation driving up costs and squeezing household budgets. Total revenues for the UK’s biggest supermarket, which proved to be a pandemic winner by taking a share from rivals and boosting online sales, rose by 6% to £61.3bn as pre-tax profits jumped from £1.1bn to £2.2bn in the year to the end of 26 February. However, the company warned of “significant uncertainties” weighing on the business, including whether customer shopping behaviour would change as the nation moves out of the coronavirus pandemic, cost inflation, and investment to keep prices low versus budget operators, such as Aldi and Lidl. On Wednesday, the Office for National Statistics revealed that inflation hit a three-decade high of 7% last month, and could reach a four-decade high of 10% by the end of the year. Ken Murphy, the chief executive of Tesco, said: “Over the last year, we delivered a strong performance across the group, growing share in every part of our business. “Clearly, the external environment has become more challenging in recent months. Against a tough backdrop for our customers and with household budgets under pressure, we are laser-focused on keeping the cost of the weekly shop in check – working in close partnership with our suppliers, as well as doing everything we can to reduce our own costs.” As a result of uncertainty in the market, Tesco broadened its forecast of profits for this year to between £2.4bn and £2.6bn – less than the £2.84bn predicted by analysts.",News/Business,Tesco profits double but supermarket warns of impact of soaring inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/13/tesco-profits-double-but-supermarket-warns-of-impact-of-soaring-inflation

Indeed, Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was named in part after the 40th US president. “My parents named me after him because they both liked this name and thought it sounded strong – my father admired him,” Ronaldo told GQ in 2016 (hat-tip to Sean McHugh). “Here are two pairs of players named after Lenin and Stalin,” offers Kári Tulinius. “Lenin Steenkamp played his entire career in the USA, while Lenin Porozo has spent most of his career at El Nacional in his native Ecuador. Then there’s Stalin Rivas, capped 34 times by Venezuela, and Stalin Motta, who has played more than 400 games for La Equidad in Colombia.” “There isn’t a Tony Blair in Serie B, but there is a midfielder in Kosovo called Bler Thaçi, who is named after the former UK prime minister,” notes Dara O’Reilly, who also offers former Brazil Under-20 player Marx Lenin (“a twofer”), Liberian international Chris Roosevelt Jones and a Lazio youth player named after his great-grandfather: Romano Benito Floriano Mussolini. South America is something of a goldmine for political names. Tom Aldous suggests three Brazilians: futsal star Franklin Roosevelt Bueres, midfielder Mahatma Gandhi and Chelsea’s Kenedy – named after Robert F Kennedy. William nominates teenage Fluminense forward John Kennedy, while Lewis Dalgarno suggests the Peruvian winger Jefferson Farfan – “after Thomas, not Airplane”. Tim Dockery sent in a laundry list of presidential names, including former Galatasaray midfielder Lincoln, former Flamengo forward Nixon, a fair few Washingtons (including long-time Uruguay coach Óscar Washington Tabárez).

Would that be a record?” wonders Bogdan Kotarlic. First, a correction from John Curry: “Luton finished 11th in League Two in 2015-16 after coming eighth the year before – so they are chasing a sixth straight season of improvement. Local rivals Watford can beat that – they improved their league position for eight consecutive seasons between 1975-76 and 1982-83.” The Hornets climbed from eighth in Division Four to second in Division One in that time. Chris Roe chimes in: “This will not be a record, not even for Luton Town. Their best record stands at nine straight seasons, starting in 1978. Only Gillingham (from 1994) and Oldham (from 1969) have equalled this.” Another set of Hatters, this time at Stockport County are coming, mind. Been tracking this for a couple of years. It’s the longest stretch in English football bar Salford. This year will be the eighth, not the ninth season (we finished lower in 13/14 than 12/13 due to relegation) but it’s still a phenomenal record. Ian Ditchfield nominates National League South side Dorking Wanderers. “Their record stands at seven consecutive improvements, from fifth in the Sussex County League Division 3 in 2008-09 to second in the Isthmian League Division 1 South in 2015-16. The run was only broken by two consecutive second-place finishes, although they won the playoffs the second time. If that counts, and we disregard the voided 2021-22 season, the run will reach 12 as long as Wanderers (currently second) finish in the top six this term.” You can read more about Dorking’s remarkable rise here. “Phil Foden got another assist for England against Ivory Coast, his sixth or seventh in 15 caps depending on which source you believe. But who has the most assists for England?” muses Matty Ellis. “Given that the recording of assists wasn’t really a thing until the advent of Fantasy Football, the records don’t seem to stretch back particularly far,” notes Fred Sullivan. “Transfermarkt offer the following top 10 – no surprises for guessing No 1 …” 1) David Beckham (42)2) Raheem Sterling (25)3) Steven Gerrard (23)4) Wayne Rooney (21)5) Harry Kane (14)6) Joe Cole (14)7) Paul Scholes (13)8) Michael Owen (12)9) Frank Lampard (12)10) Emile Heskey (11) “As my housemate and I were half watching the Scotland-Northern Ireland game I completely misheard the commentator say that it was some player’s first appearance in 16 years,” wrote Jamie Dodd in 2015. “This turned out to be false following a quick rewind but it got us thinking – which player has the biggest gap between two international matches and how long was it?” The record for the longest gap between two England caps belongs to the Liverpool legend Ian Callaghan, who won his second cap against France in England’s final group game of the 1966 World Cup but then had to wait 11 years and 49 days for his third, when Ron Greenwood recalled him to face Switzerland in a friendly in 1977. But the world record. Wouter IJzermans reckoned it might be the Greek Maradona Vasilis Hatzipanagis. “His first game for Greece was on 6 May 1976 (a 1-0 victory over Poland),” wrote Wouter. “After his first match Fifa prevented him from playing again for the Greece squad because he had played for the Soviet Olympic team back in 1975 [Hatzipanagis had been born in Tashkent to Greek political refugees]. After a long career, he was offered a chance to play another international match when this restriction was lifted in 1999, which means he got his second cap at the ripe old age of 45 on the December 14 1999 in a friendly match against Ghana (1-1), 23 years after making his debut for the Greek national team.” “In 2019-20, Sheffield Wednesday scored more than twice as many league goals away from home as they did at Hillsborough,” notes Peter Newon. “Their tally of 39 away goals was highest in the Championship that season, while their total of 19 at home was the lowest. A unique ‘achievement’?” Strictly speaking that was 19.6%, but now we're over the hill to 20.4% with the 11th.

The courts had previously blocked the extradition of Kyung Yup Kim, a man accused of killing a young woman in Shanghai, citing the risk of torture and not receiving a fair trial. Wednesday’s supreme court decision, the latest in 12 years of rulings and appeals, sets a precedent for New Zealand, which, like a number of western countries, does not have an extradition treaty with China and has suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong in 2020. Of particular significance is the court’s conclusion that New Zealand’s government could trust assurances from China that extradited defendants would not be at risk of human rights abuses or torture. “I am deeply troubled by the decision,” said Dr Anna High, co-director of the Otago University’s centre for law and society. “There are grave and well-documented problems with China’s criminal justice system – the idea that a diplomatic promise is a sufficient basis for surrendering someone into that system seems, at best, incredibly naive.” The last year has seen ongoing debate over whether New Zealand’s trade reliance on China could hamper its ability to make diplomatic calls that anger Beijing – a tension that the New Zealand government has said has absolutely no bearing on its decisions over matters of principle or human rights. Kyung Yup Kim is a Korean-born permanent resident of New Zealand who came to the country in 1989. Chinese authorities suspect Kim of murdering a young woman, Peiyun Chen, on a 2009 visit to Shanghai – a charge he denies. Kim and his lawyers have repeatedly argued that if he were to be extradited, he faces the risk of torture and not would be given a fair trial. They argue assurances provided by China – including that Kim would be tried in Shanghai and that he could be visited by consular staff – are not sufficient or trustworthy. Today’s ruling quashes the court’s earlier decision, with the majority of judges concluding that “further assurances [from China] provide a reasonable basis on which the minister could be satisfied that there was no real risk of Mr Kim being tortured … [or] would face an unfair trial on surrender to the PRC”. “The assumption that diplomatic assurances from the PRC can be a sound basis for extradition is deeply concerning,” High said. “This is the same PRC which is assuring the world that the allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang are fabrications, despite an abundance of evidence to the contrary.” “There is systemic … torture in the Chinese justice system,” Kim’s lead lawyer, Dr Tony Ellis, told the Guardian, adding that assurances about torture from the Chinese government were “not worth the paper they’re written on”. He said New Zealand could not rely on assurances from China about a fair trial, and pointed to trials of foreign citizens in China, where diplomats for detainees’ home countries were excluded from the courtrooms. Speaking after a court decision in 2021, Victoria University law professor and former law commissioner Geoff McLay said that “essentially Kim is the tip of the iceberg” in terms of extraditions that China might request. “The dilemma is very stark for the courts,” he said. A 2016 Law Commission report recommended extradition decisions be removed from government ministers and be handled by the courts, to ensure decisions did not have the appearance of being affected by political pressures. The original high court ruling outlines the evidence that Chinese authorities say they hold against Kim – claims that Kim contests. They list forensic evidence, including nine blood samples found at Kim’s residence that China says were identified as being Ms Chen’s; evidence from an acquaintance of Kim’s who said he contacted him in a distressed state and that he “may have beaten a prostitute to death”; and that Chen’s body was found wrapped in materials identified by Kim’s girlfriend as being similar to those kept at his apartment. New Zealand received the extradition request from China for a charge of intentional homicide in May 2011. In late 2015, the then-minister of justice, Amy Adams, decided Kim should be surrendered to China after she sought diplomatic assurances about his treatment. But in June 2019, the court of appeal quashed the minister’s decision, saying it must be reconsidered given the risk of torture and of Kim not receiving a fair trial. The latest rulings are in response to the minister appealing against that decision, as well as a cross-appeal by Kim’s legal team. Ellis said a complaint would be filed with the UN human rights committee seeking interim measures that Kim not be extradited, and if necessary he would file a fresh judicial review on the basis of Kim’s health issues. Ellis said he had multiple health issues including depression, a small brain tumour, liver and kidney disease. If those further measures are unsuccessful, the decision on whether to extradite Kim will rest with justice minister Kris Faafoi. A spokesperson for minister’s office said “The Minister is aware of today’s judgment and will be giving it careful consideration. He won’t be commenting further at this time.”",News/World news,New Zealand allows resident to be extradited to China in landmark ruling,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/new-zealand-allows-resident-to-be-extradited-to-china-in-landmark-ruling
4/13/2022,"Insulate Britain protesters have been praised by a judge, who said he was “inspired” by their commitment to greener living, as he fined 12 of them over a demonstration that disrupted the journeys of drivers on the M25. The protesters blocked traffic at junction 3 of the motorway. Some glued themselves to the tarmac, while another glued himself to a police car. Nine of the activists admitted charges in relation to the protest either by post or in person at Crawley magistrates court on Tuesday. Mary Adams, 68, Ian Bates, 63, Karen Matthews, 60, Margurite Doubleday, 67, Bethany Mogie, 39, Xavier Gonzalez-Trimmer, 21, and Lucy Crawford, 52, each pleaded guilty to wilful obstruction of free passage of the highway Whipster, a 54-year-old from Canterbury, admitted criminal damage by leaving a “hard, crusty layer of glue” on the window of a police vehicle during the demonstration. Bates, Matthews and Whipster were told by Stephen Leake, the district judge, that they had “inspired” him after making impassioned speeches about their concerns over the climate while representing themselves in court. Leake said: “They have inspired me and personally I intend to do what I can to reduce my own impact on the planet, so to that extent your voices are certainly heard”, while adding: “I have heard your voices.” Despite saying their actions were inspiring, Leake added that his role was to “apply the law” and said their actions had caused “significant disruption” to the motorway.“These are difficult cases for us judges because we have to apply the law and that is what we have sworn our judicial oaths to do,” he added. The court heard that the disruption caused disrutpion to an estimated 18,000 vehicles across the wider area, including an ambulance carrying a patient who “urgently needed to be transported”, according to evidence from National Highways Protesters attending court on Monday, all of whom sat in the public gallery throughout the hearing, claimed they had exhausted all other means of campaigning over the climate crisis and resorted to “non-violent protest” to highlight their cause. Tissues were passed around by a member of court staff as several broke down in tears and held their faces in their hands while fellow activists voiced their fears over a “desperate” environmental situation. The judge said the protesters had “no doubt” been acting in a way they believed was “morally right” but had still committed a criminal offence. The 12 protesters received fines that ranged between £120 and £400. Another three protesters, Victoria Lindsell and Michelle Charlesworth, who were each accused of one count of wilful obstruction, and Louis McKechnie, who was charged with criminal damage, had their hearings adjourned until 28 April at Crawley magistrates Court.",News/Environment,Insulate Britain protesters praised by judge who fined them,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/13/insulate-britain-protesters-praised-by-judge-who-fined-them
4/13/2022,"The archbishop of Canterbury has intervened for the second time in a dispute over a contested memorial in the chapel at Jesus College, Cambridge, stating emphatically that “memorials to slave-traders do not belong in places of worship”. Commenting on the legal battle over a memorial plaque to Tobias Rustat, a 17th-century benefactor who invested in slavery, Justin Welby gave his unequivocal support to those seeking its removal and suggested the Church of England still has a long way to go on its journey towards racial justice. The archbishop’s intervention came after Jesus College submitted a petition to the local diocese, requesting the removal of the memorial from the chapel because its presence was having a negative impact on the mission and ministry of the church. The college said the plaque would be relocated elsewhere in the college where it would not interfere with worship, but could be studied as an important historical memorial. Last month, however a church court denied the petition, ruling that opposition to the memorial was based on “a false narrative” about the scale of the financial rewards Rustat gained from slavery, and ordered that the memorial should remain in the chapel. Welby said he had no doubt the law had been followed and that the Church of England’s contested heritage guidance used, but added: “But if we are content with a situation where people of colour are excluded from places of worship because of the pain caused by such memorials, then clearly we have a lot further to go in our journey towards racial justice.” It is not the first time the archbishop has felt compelled to intervene in the dispute. Earlier this year, speaking at the General Synod, he questioned why it was proving so difficult to move the Rustat memorial when it caused distress to people whose ancestors were sold into slavery. “I stand by those comments,” he said on Tuesday. “The Church of England has a dark history where slavery is concerned that we need to confront. Racial injustice, inside the church and outside, is an issue that exists to this day,” Welby said. “Since the end of 2019, the church commissioners, of which I am the chair and the Archbishop of York is a board member, have embarked on the process to uncover and confront this dark past, with the aim of restoration, repair and promoting a better future for us all. They are due to report within the coming months on their findings.” Earlier this week, Jesus College ruled out an appeal against the consistory court judgment. The master of the college, Sonita Alleyne, who is the first black master of an Oxbridge college, warned, however, that the church of England’s procedures for addressing issues of racial injustice and contested heritage were inadequate and not fit for purpose.
